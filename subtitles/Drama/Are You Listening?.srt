1
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:56,970
Tell me, why are you here?

2
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,908
I'm here to become a student.

3
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,978
I need to learn how to meditate,
how to control my thoughts,

4
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,814
and where they happen.

5
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,967
Why do you need to learn this?

6
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,419
I've done something.

7
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,218
Something very bad.

8
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:22,269
And I need to set it right.

9
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,282
Let me take care of dinner tonight.

10
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:27,516
- I've got an extra sausage.
- How could I turn down charm like that?

11
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,289
- I'm serious.
- I'm tired.

12
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,491
Yeah, but tonight, I mean.

13
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,335
I'll be more tired after work.

14
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,499
Let's go out, then.

15
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:48,201
You work too much. We could ask
your mom to take care of Lana.

16
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,535
We could go to that Thai place
that you really like.

17
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,610
Fine.

18
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:07,117
Won't the paper burn when it explodes?

19
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,019
It's not that kind of explosion.

20
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,855
We're going to make a chemical reaction.

21
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:15,777
What's a chemical reaction?

22
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,226
It's kind of like magic.

23
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:21,284
- Cool.
- Yeah.

24
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,758
There you go, Grams.

25
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:51,021
- Let's roll, gangsta.
- What, what!

26
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:52,355
- Seriously?
- Shut up.

27
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,779
Such a dork.

28
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,867
For example, the subject is asked
to think about Marilyn Monroe.

29
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,669
My study suggests
not only conscious control

30
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,638
in the hippocampus
and parahippocampal cortex...

31
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:17,341
Hey, did you hear about
the new bioengineering transfer?

32
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:21,844
My friend's in her class. He says on a scale
of one to ten, she's a lemniscate.

33
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:24,435
But also...

34
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,282
Mr. Thorogood, perhaps you could
enlighten us all with Ryan's gossip

35
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:33,419
or tell us what else we can conclude
with this study?

36
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,679
We can conclude that all neurosurgeons
are in love with Marilyn Monroe.

37
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:46,328
A single neuron has not only the ability
to carry complex code and abstract form

38
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:49,597
but is also able to override sensory input
through cognitive effort.

39
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:54,033
It suggests thought is a stronger reality
than the world around us.

40
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,992
Unfortunately,
I think you're both correct.

41
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,471
Dude, that's bullcrap.

42
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:05,041
I'm telling you, man,
brains out-duels brawn every time.

43
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:09,244
It's not just brawn. He's the most powerful
character in any universe. He's unbeatable.

44
00:07:09,344 --> 00:07:11,868
Except for kryptonite.

45
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,949
- Blanket?
- He could only win if he fought dirty.

46
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:18,817
If Supes took a sucker punch,
it'd be over just as easy.

47
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:21,986
Say, no warning, they're both
just teleported into a cage match.

48
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:25,940
It doesn't matter. Batman keeps
kryptonite in his utility belt.

49
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:31,660
Man, oh, man, give me some gloves.

50
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,151
Those Bunsen burners
are too hot to handle.

51
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,864
- Dude, did you just see that?
- See what?

52
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,366
She totally just checked me out.
I'm gonna go talk to her.

53
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:45,002
- Not now. I'm...
- Hey. I'm Ryan.

54
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:47,804
I know. We have chemistry together.

55
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:49,962
Slow down.

56
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,452
- David Thorogood?
- Yeah?

57
00:08:03,552 --> 00:08:07,305
You missed your rent payments for November
and January. I'm here to collect.

58
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,658
No, I talked to Stan.
He's our landlord, and he...

59
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,060
- He handed the situation over to us.
- No, he said...

60
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,549
You owe 5,690. Late fees included.

61
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,258
Is that a new computer, David?

62
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:37,636
Damn it.

63
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,051
David, I'd like you to meet Jordan.

64
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,936
- Hi.
- Dave's my best friend, business partner,

65
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:49,295
and the second smartest person
I know after yours truly.

66
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Dude, what are you doing?

67
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,425
Just wait a minute.
I know what you're going to say.

68
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:56,271
I'm sorry. We have to talk for just a minute.
Do you mind waiting outside?

69
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,819
Sorry, babe, one sec.

70
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,133
- You told her about our research.
- Yeah, 'cause she's assigned...

71
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,275
- You just met this girl. If it gets out...
- I know...

72
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,532
You're the one that said it has
to stay secret to remain valuable.

73
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:11,004
If the school finds out, if they even suspect,
I cannot afford to lose my financial aid.

74
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:12,273
- You said...
- I know what I said.

75
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:15,807
My own wife doesn't even know what we're
doing. No girls, man. That was your rule.

76
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:18,442
- All she's gotta do is make one phone call...
- She's not going to.

77
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:21,577
...about some missing equipment,
unauthorized experiments, and that's it.

78
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:23,901
We're done!

79
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,918
Everything all right with Mel?

80
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,353
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

81
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,710
Shut up.

82
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:47,197
Now will you just listen for a minute, okay?
Jordan might just look like a hot body,

83
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:50,427
but she's assigned to Professor Hamamoto's
experiments with ATP powered,

84
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:54,770
cell-powering nanotube devices.
Let's give her a peek, see what she says.

85
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,972
We'll make her sign a nondisclosure
agreement and the whole nine yards, okay?

86
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:02,456
She doesn't know we've borrowed lab equipment
so you don't have to worry about that.

87
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:16,119
I've seen this before.

88
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:19,755
Accuracy takes a nose dive once the word
library goes over 80 or 90 words.

89
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,924
We're averaging almost 90% accuracy.

90
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:25,494
Most EEG nets track less than 100 neurons.

91
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:29,663
My compact electrode design
lets us track almost 1,000.

92
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,066
How many words does it recognize?

93
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,515
2,486.

94
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:38,504
Holy shit.

95
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:42,728
Military applications are obvious? DARPA's
been trying to get this to work for years.

96
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:45,910
- Cell phones themselves will become obsolete.
- But we are nowhere near there yet.

97
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,977
It's tedious. It's like training
voice-recognition software

98
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:51,334
from scratch with a stutterer.

99
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,653
Yeah.

100
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,151
And response time is slow.

101
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:58,467
Exactly. It's...

102
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:03,590
Your mind can have a dozen
thoughts in a millisecond,

103
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,194
but it takes you five seconds
to say, "Hi, sexy"?

104
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,563
- It's not perfect.
- It's crap.

105
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:13,432
You're proud of measuring 1,000 neurons?

106
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:16,802
You're trying to read the contents of an
entire library by walking through the aisles.

107
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,203
You gotta open the books to know
what's really going on inside.

108
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,906
- We're not neurosurgeons.
- You don't need surgery.

109
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:26,776
You need nanotubes.
We can create molecular electrodes

110
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:30,379
by embedding carbon nanotubes
into microscopic transistors

111
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,582
that can bond
with every neuron in your brain.

112
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:36,918
So you can decode signal
from 1,000 electrodes, so what?

113
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:41,285
What are you gonna do with 100 billion?

114
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:47,040
I told you.

115
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,258
Next suggestion.

116
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,240
Yes, sir.

117
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:26,666
Sit.

118
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,326
Good boy, Bubba. Good boy.

119
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:11,194
- Oh, hi.
- Who are you?

120
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:15,338
I'm Jordan. Oh, you must be David's wife.

121
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,240
- David?
- Yeah?

122
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,389
David?

123
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:26,160
Hey, Mel, you look amazing.

124
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:40,606
Who is that?

125
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:46,710
It's Ryan's friend.
She's helping us out now.

126
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,180
Well, are you ready?

127
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,339
Listen, we had a significant breakthrough.

128
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,674
Things are just changing so fast.
We really need this right now, like...

129
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,656
So?

130
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:10,929
Could we just... could we just
do this another night, please?

131
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:16,750
Yeah, sure.

132
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,700
It wasn't a big deal anyway.

133
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:26,193
You look really nice.

134
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,075
Did you get a haircut?

135
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,726
Hey, man. How's it going?

136
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:50,198
I'm just getting something to drink.

137
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,385
You need a ride home or something?

138
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:58,102
Nah, it's cool actually.
I think Jordan can take me.

139
00:15:03,757 --> 00:15:07,244
So how's your grandma doing?

140
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,397
It is what it is.

141
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:12,983
If I could afford a doctor, they'd probably
find a million things wrong with her.

142
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,140
You know what?

143
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:20,572
Why don't you take some fruit for her?

144
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:24,306
- Come on, man. You don't have to do that.
- It's fine.

145
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,992
Here.

146
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:35,584
We're gonna bust this thing open soon.
You know that?

147
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,712
You know it.

148
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:45,075
Got you some <i>carne asada</i>, Grams.

149
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,993
No, I ate.

150
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:31,999
- They're beautiful.
- All right. Let's do this.

151
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:35,689
- Where did this come from again?
- Stop stalling.

152
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,258
You should feel numb pretty quick.

153
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:43,745
- Why do I have to do the injections again?
- Because, if we need a second test subject,

154
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:47,922
I don't want you injecting me
without practicing first.

155
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:52,919
- Here you go.
- Holy crap, that's big.

156
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:54,787
- That's what she said.
- Really?

157
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:56,889
That's your contribution
to this situation right now?

158
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,190
Relax, you're gonna screw up
if you're all tense like that.

159
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,980
- Just get ready.
- I'm ready.

160
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,760
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

161
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,271
- You feel those two bumps?
- Yeah.

162
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,496
Those are his L-three
and L-four vertebrae.

163
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:10,798
You want to stick the needle in
the space just between those two.

164
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,792
You should feel a give right away,
otherwise you're in the wrong spot.

165
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,530
Okay.

166
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,493
I can't do this.

167
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:36,186
I don't like this.

168
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:39,555
The computers I could justify somehow.
They've got tons of computers.

169
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,258
You didn't like injecting me
blind either, now, did you?

170
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:45,226
- This will let you see what you're doing.
- We should be doing this at night.

171
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:48,420
It's more suspicious at night.
Plus everything's locked up.

172
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,980
Don't worry. No one would ever
expect a fluoroscope to be stolen.

173
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,350
Somebody's definitely
gonna notice when it's gone.

174
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,533
That was easy. Grab the blanket.

175
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,589
How you doing?

176
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,553
You're insane.

177
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:21,428
Hey, kiddo, I think it's time
for you to paint your volcano.

178
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:26,324
- Will you paint it with me?
- I tell you what,

179
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:31,836
how about you paint it, and then later
I can show you how to make it explode?

180
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:34,639
Okay.

181
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:40,796
All right.

182
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,955
Here you go.

183
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,250
You got it?

184
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:56,525
Awesome.

185
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,627
Shouldn't we be wearing
lead vests or something?

186
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,573
Probably.

187
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,721
- All right.
- Thanks.

188
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:14,990
- You know what you're doing?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,761
Just talk about something else,
so I don't get all freaked out, okay?

190
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,110
We can do that.

191
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,801
So... Ryan...

192
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,317
why don't we ever go to your place?

193
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:37,954
- I only bring girlfriends to my place.
- You don't want me to be your girlfriend?

194
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,376
I live in a tiny studio apartment
with my grandma.

195
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:44,412
Not exactly the glamorous lifestyle.

196
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,979
What about your parents?

197
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,462
My mom died when I was 16.

198
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,123
I'm sorry.

199
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,955
What happened?

200
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,257
She'd been sick for a long time.

201
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,840
It was one of those awesome,
slow, agonizing cancers.

202
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,127
- What was that?
- No, it's okay.

203
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:07,503
You broke through the arachnoid matter.
It means you're in.

204
00:20:08,462 --> 00:20:10,645
Keep talking.

205
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:15,249
My... dad...

206
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:19,384
remarried about a month later.

207
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:25,008
Turned out he'd been cheating
the whole time.

208
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,478
Told me he had a new family now

209
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:32,014
and that his dead wife's kid and grandma

210
00:20:32,114 --> 00:20:35,117
were no longer his responsibility.

211
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,599
That's it.

212
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,888
- Done.
- Thanks for telling me that.

213
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:47,222
Whatever, I was just trying to keep Dr. Pansy
here from cracking under the pressure.

214
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,475
No, you weren't.

215
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,370
How long does he have to hang like that?

216
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,407
Long enough for gravity to take
the nanotubes into his brain.

217
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:08,176
And... how long is that?

218
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:12,360
I don't know.
No one's ever done this before.

219
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:20,903
You're back.

220
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,589
Just for a little bit.

221
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:26,572
I'm picking up Angela's shift later.

222
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,309
Where's...

223
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,991
where's Lana?

224
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:49,646
She's in the bathroom.

225
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:52,396
She was covered in paint.

226
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:02,473
- Where is the TV?
- We needed it in the garage.

227
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,327
Right.

228
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:24,642
Okay, I'll admit it. If this thing works,
I'll be thoroughly impressed.

229
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:28,878
And don't you forget it. But if it cooks my
brain, you just remember my glory days.

230
00:22:28,978 --> 00:22:32,280
Yeah. Spent in a garage
playing with yourself.

231
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,589
Okay, how are we gonna know
that this thing is working?

232
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,217
Ryan's thoughts should appear
on this output screen here.

233
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:42,623
- Let's start the party!
- All right, here we go.

234
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:49,574
Please, God, don't let him die.

235
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,866
Ryan? Ryan? You okay?

236
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:18,821
- I'm fine. Careful with that.
- Okay, what just happened?

237
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,923
The array struggled to enumerate the number
of electrode cycles flowing through,

238
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:24,429
let alone to analyze the input frequencies.
I'll have to apportion the feed

239
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:28,397
to sector designated processors before we're
able to fathom a conscious filter algorithm.

240
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:31,963
It means it worked.

241
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:48,623
Sir, it's one of the university leads.

242
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,727
They've shown progress.

243
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:12,479
That'll be all, Gates.

244
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:26,596
Next suggestion: "Kill the dog."

245
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,661
Suggest:

246
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:48,111
"I want to kill the dog."

247
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,584
"I must kill my dog."

248
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:08,459
"I have to kill my dog.
My life depends on it."

249
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:26,522
We need something new.

250
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,113
Trace.

251
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,135
Track.

252
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,517
Traction.

253
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:41,205
Tractor.

254
00:25:41,905 --> 00:25:43,758
Trade.

255
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,841
Trademark.

256
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,928
Tradition.

257
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,785
Well, the system, it isn't crashing,
which is really good news.

258
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:02,687
How is any of this good news?

259
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:05,613
That we found a couple of words
in the feed. It's just...

260
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:09,425
It's just way more data than we thought.
It's gonna take time to decode, that's all.

261
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:12,832
- How much time?
- Months? Years?

262
00:26:12,932 --> 00:26:14,823
- I don't know.
- It has to happen live. Real time.

263
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,931
What's the point of a machine that reads
your thoughts a year after you have them?

264
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:21,000
- It'd make a pretty nifty diary.
- Damn it! I'm not kidding.

265
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,669
A full night's worth of data,
and all you've got is...

266
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:26,986
"Hippopotamus"? "Menstruate"?

267
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,042
I need an aspirin.

268
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:39,049
Look, man, I'm... I'm sorry.

269
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:43,152
There's just not a machine fast enough
to decode human thought in real time.

270
00:26:43,252 --> 00:26:45,921
It just... just doesn't exist.

271
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:50,371
Well... there is one.

272
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,560
No.

273
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,471
The brain is the world's fastest computer.
Nothing else is even close.

274
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,497
- No. No, no, no. No.
- Yes.

275
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:04,448
The only thing fast enough to decode
the human brain is the human brain.

276
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:29,349
- What's the worst that could happen?
- Worst-case scenario, it's too much activity,

277
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:32,853
completely fries your cortex,
and you lose all cognitive ability.

278
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:35,705
Relax. It's gonna be fine.
It's only a one-way connection.

279
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:38,140
I'll only hear her thoughts.

280
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,326
So...

281
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:43,595
what do you think of Jordan?

282
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:46,531
So what, are you guys,
like, officially dating now?

283
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:50,234
No, no, nothing's happened yet.
But I like her.

284
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:53,270
Like, I think she could be...

285
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,921
I don't know, something.
She's cool, right?

286
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,230
Ready?

287
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,817
Damn.

288
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,521
- Just try to think simple, clear thoughts.
- What does that mean?

289
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:53,541
I have no idea.

290
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:56,101
You okay?

291
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:59,109
Fine. I just got dizzy for a second.

292
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:05,448
- Just try and clear your mind.
- It's a blank slate.

293
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:12,005
- Ten seconds.
- Don't stop it early.

294
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:23,583
Don't think about DARKBIRD.

295
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:28,499
I know what you want.
I understand what you've been through.

296
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:31,123
It's okay.

297
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:35,027
Touch me, Ryan. Love me. Feel me.

298
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,043
I want it too.

299
00:30:40,264 --> 00:30:42,313
Don't let him find out.

300
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,670
Ryan? Ryan, can you hear me? Are you okay?

301
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,673
- I'm great.
- What happened?

302
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:54,809
- It worked.
- Yeah, but what was it like?

303
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,515
Better than sex.

304
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:05,498
Ladies and gentlemen...

305
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:12,225
We have just invented telepathy.

306
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,227
Guys, she said she wanted
no cheese on the salad,

307
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:20,529
and the burger's supposed to be well done.

308
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,678
- Yeah. Don't look at me. I wrote it down.
- Yeah.

309
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:24,631
- Rough night?
- Yeah. Wake me when it's over.

310
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:27,214
Just getting started, girl.

311
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:40,275
Honestly, man, I thought we killed you,

312
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,370
and then I went through
the seven stages of grief in, like...

313
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,015
- half a second, and then I was like...
- David... what is this?

314
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:49,617
Hey, we're having a party!

315
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:53,687
What are you doing?
Get off of me! What is this?

316
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,869
What does it mean?

317
00:31:59,524 --> 00:32:02,041
It means we're being evicted.

318
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:10,148
I thought you were calling the landlord.

319
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:17,307
- What are you celebrating?
- That's what she said.

320
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:20,151
That doesn't even make any sense.

321
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:26,329
Come here, sweetie.

322
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,588
How long do you have?

323
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,659
Two weeks.

324
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,105
So what are we gonna do?

325
00:33:05,115 --> 00:33:08,232
Get a finished product before then.

326
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:28,251
Blueberries are my favorite.

327
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:32,207
It's our secret what happened.

328
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,536
I hope he doesn't find out.

329
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,440
Keep it a secret.

330
00:33:56,156 --> 00:33:58,167
Take my body, David.

331
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:01,539
That's enough.

332
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,274
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

333
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,932
I didn't mean to scare you.

334
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:28,419
They said they had a pot of coffee on.
Do you mind if I...

335
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,368
Sure.

336
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:16,331
- What's this?
- We're going around in circles.

337
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:19,867
- I need results. You're not giving me results.
- Well, we're making steady progress.

338
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:24,704
- Every practical application has failed.
- What do you mean "practical application"?

339
00:35:24,804 --> 00:35:28,207
You're not field testing.
We're nowhere near ready.

340
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:31,944
Exactly. We're no closer today
than we were a year ago.

341
00:35:32,944 --> 00:35:36,264
- What am I looking at?
- The next phase. DARKBIRD II.

342
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:40,717
Looks like a couple of Caltech students
cracked the nut before you could.

343
00:35:40,817 --> 00:35:43,620
Well, the likelihood of that
is minimal at best.

344
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,056
Unlikely things happen
all the time, Doctor.

345
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:49,773
We make a business of it.

346
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,710
"When she thought about it afterward,
it occurred to her

347
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,845
that she ought to have wondered at this."

348
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,369
"However, when the rabbit took a watch
out of his waistcoat pocket,

349
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:05,705
"Alice stood silent, watching him.

350
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:09,825
"Suddenly, she brightened up.
'Look! Look!' she cried."

351
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:11,676
- Damn it!
- Look.

352
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:14,478
I need the money more than anybody,
but it's just not ready yet.

353
00:36:14,578 --> 00:36:17,414
I talked to some guys who graduated
a while back. They know these venture...

354
00:36:17,514 --> 00:36:20,549
Ryan! It's not ready, okay?

355
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:24,185
Like this whole page.
I don't remember any of this page.

356
00:36:24,485 --> 00:36:27,421
Yeah. I don't even remember
reading this, really.

357
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:30,424
- So maybe you're reading automatically.
- What do you mean?

358
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:33,392
We're tapping the part of the brain
that we think is processing metacognition.

359
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,646
Yeah, but if I glazed over...

360
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:37,645
The words keep coming out because
you know how to read instinctively.

361
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:41,096
And instead, whatever it is you're
really thinking goes through the wire.

362
00:36:47,568 --> 00:36:51,038
- Dad?
- Yeah?

363
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:55,054
Can you show me how
to make my volcano explode?

364
00:36:57,508 --> 00:37:00,278
Sorry, kiddo, look,
we're just really busy right now.

365
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:03,319
- But the science fair is Friday.
- Okay.

366
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:07,451
Look, I promise I'll show you
how to make it work before then.

367
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:10,666
- Okay?
- Okay.

368
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:15,691
Yeah, I'm a little more
than slightly nervous.

369
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:18,974
Don't worry.
Grams actually loves visitors.

370
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,545
Am I dressed okay?

371
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:27,900
Maybe just button up
your sweater or something.

372
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,215
Let me have it.

373
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:33,037
Okay, now...

374
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:37,140
It's tiny and probably a mess.
You have to promise not to judge, okay?

375
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,843
- I promise.
- Good. Now just wait right here a sec.

376
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:44,826
- I need to let Grams know you're coming.
- She doesn't know I'm coming?

377
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:52,486
Grams, I brought a friend over.
Think you can get up for a bit?

378
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,637
Grams, there's someone I want you to meet.

379
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:41,131
I don't have that kind of money.

380
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:45,568
That's the absolute bare minimum.
We can't do it for any less than that.

381
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:48,238
I don't have any money.

382
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:51,874
Isn't there any family that could...

383
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:54,723
There's no family.

384
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:00,428
I'm the only family.

385
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:09,436
Thanks, baby.

386
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,858
I guessed the jelly beans.

387
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,260
Professor Thompson wanted to prove
the jelly bean experiment.

388
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,730
You know, like we're in fourth
grade or something. 2,486.

389
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,633
I won two free movie passes.
I want you guys to go, right now.

390
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,716
Take a break.

391
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,382
I don't like this.

392
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:43,784
Are you even going to talk to me
about the other day?

393
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,900
No. No, I'm not.

394
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:54,858
Doug, nice to meet you in person.
Welcome to our humble laboratory.

395
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:58,624
- This is Jordan.
- Let's cut to the chase.

396
00:39:58,724 --> 00:40:03,264
You made some pretty outrageous claims on
the phone and I don't like my time wasted.

397
00:40:03,364 --> 00:40:07,868
But Jerry vouched for you, so here I am.

398
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:11,237
- Let's see it.
- Okay. Sure. Of course.

399
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:14,406
But you can't really just see it.
You need to experience it,

400
00:40:14,506 --> 00:40:17,041
which means we need to...

401
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:22,861
administer a small injection
into your cerebrospinal fluid.

402
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,116
- Go ahead.
- Sir.

403
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,487
- Is it safe?
- Completely.

404
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:33,736
- So go ahead, then.
- You're gonna have to take off your shirt.

405
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:21,913
Do you want to see
what we've been working on?

406
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,598
So we're actually going to be able
to talk to each other with our minds?

407
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:35,235
Not exactly. If we both listen to each
other's thoughts at the same time,

408
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,771
it could create a circular feedback loop.

409
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,139
Meaning?

410
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,443
Meaning if I was listening to your thoughts
listening to my thoughts

411
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:48,947
listening to your thoughts
and on and on and on and on,

412
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:51,516
then it could create a resonance,

413
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:54,675
like when you hold a microphone
too close to a speaker.

414
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:02,225
So I'm just gonna hear your thoughts then.

415
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,661
Right. You ready?

416
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:06,777
I guess.

417
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:20,007
I love you so much, baby.

418
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:22,909
Everything I do is for you and Lana.

419
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:25,978
This should fix things.
We should have done this sooner.

420
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:28,046
I shouldn't have scared her
with the feedback loop.

421
00:43:28,146 --> 00:43:30,448
Everything I do is for you and Lana.

422
00:43:30,548 --> 00:43:33,651
What was I thinking? I hope you know that.

423
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:36,020
Hopefully she doesn't see
anything about Jordan.

424
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,222
This is going to change the world.
Everything is going to be okay now.

425
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:42,038
Don't think about Jordan.

426
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,668
- How was it?
- Get it off. Get it off. Get it off.

427
00:43:46,768 --> 00:43:50,263
Okay, okay, okay, there. It's off.

428
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:52,579
What happened?

429
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,703
- What did you do?
- What do you mean? What happened?

430
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,205
- I saw her. I saw Jordan!
- Saw who? Saw what? Tell me!

431
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:05,474
- You had sex with her.
- That... that is not true.

432
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:09,811
Don't lie to me.
You can't lie to me. I saw it!

433
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,560
- God, I saw it in your head.
- Mel.

434
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,514
My God. I kept telling myself that I was
crazy, that it was... it was nothing...

435
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:18,243
- Melanie, it wasn't real.
- It was real. I felt it.

436
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:21,685
You probably felt a lot of things. 30 thoughts
a second are flying into your mind.

437
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:24,412
Anything that pops into my consciousness,
no matter how fleeting,

438
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:29,938
- you feel it, as if it was real.
- Just stop it! Stop it.

439
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:36,563
This whole time I thought
that our biggest issue

440
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:41,834
- was your prima donna bullshit, and now...
- I have never done anything with her.

441
00:44:42,634 --> 00:44:44,483
Never.

442
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:48,509
I've just...

443
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:51,498
I've just thought about it.

444
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:57,356
No. I don't believe you.

445
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:39,298
Ryan, David,
you mind staying for a moment?

446
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:45,255
You know, a half dozen computers have up
and vanished in the last couple of years.

447
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:50,181
Couple of weeks ago,
half a fluoroscopy table went missing.

448
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:56,465
And then last night,
at one of the galas that we host,

449
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:59,000
I got to talking
to an entertaining young fellow,

450
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,937
and he told me a story about an invention
that's going to change everything,

451
00:46:04,337 --> 00:46:07,673
about unauthorized experimentation,

452
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:12,590
and seriously dangerous,
extremely unethical human testing.

453
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,226
You're both expelled.

454
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:27,087
What just happened?

455
00:46:27,487 --> 00:46:31,098
I don't know, man.
We better clear out your garage.

456
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:35,827
Ryan, come on. Who was he talking about?
How did he know?

457
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,029
I don't know. We got blitzed.

458
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,712
- Your AC's busted.
- How did he know?

459
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:47,837
Look, you're obsessed with testing,
so while you were gone the other night,

460
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:52,121
I had this VC guy come over,
and I pitched him the project.

461
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:56,209
- You did what?
- I needed the cash. I'm sorry.

462
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:00,060
- You needed the cash.
- Yes, I needed the cash.

463
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:10,642
Oh, shit.

464
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:23,602
Please wait there, sir. I said stop!

465
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:27,336
- David, what is going on?
- David Thorogood?

466
00:47:27,436 --> 00:47:30,735
- Are you okay?
- You stole everything?

467
00:47:30,835 --> 00:47:32,971
Stop, now!

468
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,920
Ryan. Ryan Cates.

469
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:38,256
Fuck.

470
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:40,925
Wait.

471
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:46,595
- How about this one?
- You want to read me the serial number?

472
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:49,951
- You can't take those.
- You'd be mistaken about that.

473
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:52,890
No, I mean what's on those computers.
I own what's on those computers.

474
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,322
David Thorogood...

475
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:57,404
you're under arrest.

476
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:11,804
- Look, I'm sorry.
- No.

477
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:15,908
Stop, I don't want to hear another word
coming out of your mouth.

478
00:48:16,308 --> 00:48:18,157
Fine.

479
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:24,095
I'm getting evicted,
and you cashed in behind my back?

480
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:31,634
I know you were stealing food
out of my fridge.

481
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:35,290
Who does that?

482
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,973
Who steals groceries?

483
00:48:41,477 --> 00:48:45,729
Bail's been posted, lover boys.
You're free to go.

484
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,160
Grams died.

485
00:49:05,815 --> 00:49:08,733
I couldn't even afford a casket.

486
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:19,728
Hey, boys.

487
00:49:19,828 --> 00:49:21,829
Let's go.

488
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,245
Ryan, wait.

489
00:49:26,332 --> 00:49:28,883
Ryan, come on.

490
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:44,897
Hello?

491
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:15,026
- David.
- Hi, Sharon. How are you?

492
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,982
Is Melanie here?

493
00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:24,251
No, she did say that she
didn't want to see you.

494
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:26,587
Hey, kiddo!

495
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,770
Get back inside, Lana.

496
00:50:37,278 --> 00:50:39,729
It's okay, Mom.

497
00:50:56,846 --> 00:51:00,696
- What did you tell Lana?
- Nothing.

498
00:51:01,502 --> 00:51:07,107
Her volcano didn't explode
at the science fair, so she's pretty upset.

499
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:10,407
- I'm sorry.
- Don't tell me.

500
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:16,398
So what, they let you out already?

501
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:20,101
- We posted bail.
- How'd that happen?

502
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:23,484
Jordan had some savings, I guess.

503
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:25,625
Of course.

504
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:28,455
Mel...

505
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,842
I really need you right now.

506
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:34,579
No, it looks like she's
taking care of you just fine.

507
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:38,196
- You know that's not true.
- No, I don't, actually.

508
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:44,838
We get officially evicted tomorrow.

509
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,787
Yup.

510
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,560
Look...

511
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,797
I think it's time that we just stop
forcing this, just face the truth.

512
00:51:55,897 --> 00:52:00,467
And we both know
that if it wasn't for Lana,

513
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:05,777
we would have never gotten married,
and I just think that...

514
00:52:07,238 --> 00:52:10,309
We should just stop
torturing ourselves and just move on.

515
00:52:10,409 --> 00:52:15,379
- For you, our marriage has just been torture?
- Come on. You know what I mean.

516
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:17,931
You cannot tell me that you've
actually enjoyed the last few years.

517
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:21,917
- I have enjoyed every moment together.
- Oh, my God.

518
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:26,554
I can't do this! I can't have you here.
I can't have you come here tomorrow.

519
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:28,489
I just... I need some time, okay?

520
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,825
So can you... I don't know,
can you stay with Ryan or something?

521
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:34,828
Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.

522
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:37,030
I just need to know we're gonna be okay.

523
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,033
No, we're not!
You can't have it both ways.

524
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:46,504
You can't spend all of your time
working on your crazy experiments

525
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:50,740
and expect your marriage to work too.
You have to sacrifice something.

526
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,889
I know.

527
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:57,359
So what is more important?

528
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:01,296
Changing the world...

529
00:53:02,415 --> 00:53:04,865
or changing us?

530
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,194
What's going on?

531
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,544
Oh, man.

532
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:23,599
- What are you doing?
- Just taking what's mine.

533
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,735
- This stuff is both of ours.
- No.

534
00:53:26,835 --> 00:53:30,738
The computers and programming supplies,
those were yours.

535
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:32,840
The head patches, those are mine.

536
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,609
The nanotubes and med supplies,
those are Jordan's.

537
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:39,179
- Why didn't you tell me about your grandma?
- You know what the best part about it is?

538
00:53:39,279 --> 00:53:43,583
Now that we're bypassing your BCI
and connecting brain to brain directly,

539
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:46,631
- we don't even need a programmer anymore!
- Ryan, don't do this.

540
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:49,893
- Yeah, come on, this is stupid.
- You stay out of it!

541
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,365
Look, I get it, okay? You've been abandoned
by every important person in your life.

542
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:03,934
Death sucks.

543
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:07,470
Your dad's an idiot. It's why you cut ties
with anyone before they can hurt you.

544
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,825
It's why you go through girls so fast,
it's why you got an investor behind my back,

545
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:13,013
- and it's why you're leaving.
- You think that reading my thoughts...

546
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:16,075
No, it's because you're my friend.
That's how I know.

547
00:54:16,175 --> 00:54:20,067
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
I'm not gonna die,

548
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:24,260
leave, or secretly betray you
somehow, I promise.

549
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,150
Just...

550
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:29,699
Just stay.

551
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,703
Ryan! Please.

552
00:54:36,188 --> 00:54:39,240
Are you driving, or am I walking?

553
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:49,448
- I'm sorry.
- Just drive, okay?

554
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,743
Package one is in the red sedan
on Lunada Place.

555
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:45,531
You're back.

556
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,734
Couldn't do it.

557
00:55:51,721 --> 00:55:54,472
Wasn't right, what he did to you.

558
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:04,400
Whatever. Doesn't matter,
it's the least of my worries now.

559
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,401
Yeah.

560
00:56:06,501 --> 00:56:08,951
I guess you're right.

561
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:50,444
Well, I'm sure you boys
got some questions.

562
00:56:50,544 --> 00:56:52,779
- Who are you?
- My name's Harry Matthews,

563
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:56,514
- Executive Director of Operation DARKBIRD.
- DARKBIRD?

564
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:59,533
Brain Information
Reconnaissance Directive.

565
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:02,853
We work out of the Clandestine
Information Technology Office.

566
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,421
Oh, shit.

567
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:10,024
- You're a spy?
- I'm sorry.

568
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:12,473
How did you...

569
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,761
- What's her real name?
- Jordan Rose.

570
00:57:15,861 --> 00:57:19,630
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're pretty sure.

571
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,298
- Where are we?
- KPYL Chemical.

572
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:26,215
Undercover research facility
in Washington, D.C.

573
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:30,171
We'd like to offer you boys
employment with the company.

574
00:57:30,271 --> 00:57:33,173
Is kidnapping your usual
recruitment method these days?

575
00:57:33,273 --> 00:57:36,143
Nah. Not usually.

576
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:41,180
But the ability to read minds is obviously
a matter of urgent national security.

577
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,815
- How did you find us?
- Six months ago.

578
00:57:43,915 --> 00:57:45,283
You hacked into our CITO network,

579
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:48,652
and you downloaded our most
advanced EEG analysis software.

580
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:52,155
You thought we didn't notice. We did.

581
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:54,624
Most of the biggest breakthroughs
happen off the radar.

582
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:57,759
Can she not talk anymore?
I'd prefer it if she stopped talking.

583
00:57:57,959 --> 00:57:59,927
The company cannot afford
to be behind the curve.

584
00:58:00,027 --> 00:58:04,351
- What, so you sent in spies?
- Yeah, we're the CIA. That's what we do.

585
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:07,346
We've been funding BCI research
for quite some time, but...

586
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:10,770
codes of ethics tend to slow down
our government operations.

587
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,539
We strictly avoid any dangerous
human experimentation.

588
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:15,807
Yeah, but why did you wait
so long to bring us in?

589
00:58:15,907 --> 00:58:17,742
It's hard to capture lightning
in a bottle twice.

590
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:20,544
We usually just let these projects
go until the well dries up.

591
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:23,946
But Jordan convinced us that you boys
might be of use to us here at DARKBIRD.

592
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:26,849
So... here we are.

593
00:58:26,949 --> 00:58:30,251
If it's still an option, I think I'll just
leave. I won't tell anyone what I know.

594
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:32,538
- My lips are sealed.
- Sit down.

595
00:58:32,638 --> 00:58:36,023
No. I don't care what your pitch is.
I can't work with either of these people.

596
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:38,591
You can't work with...
you're the one that we can't trust!

597
00:58:38,691 --> 00:58:42,193
- Don't start lecturing me on trust again.
- I don't care what you've been through.

598
00:58:42,293 --> 00:58:44,561
It doesn't give you free license
to be a backstabbing bastard.

599
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:48,230
Tell me how you really feel. Why don't you
tell me about this software you hacked?

600
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,065
It wouldn't have mattered if you could
stop chasing ass for five seconds.

601
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:54,699
Okay, stop. It wasn't his fault.
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

602
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,736
I do. Your Bond girl act
ruined my marriage.

603
00:58:56,836 --> 00:59:00,085
Your marriage was shit long
before she came into the picture.

604
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:02,356
Stop it!

605
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,823
Don't! Stop it! Oh, my God.

606
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:13,462
Get up.

607
00:59:23,788 --> 00:59:26,024
Here's the offer.

608
00:59:26,324 --> 00:59:29,440
First, I'm gonna clear your name
of all criminal charges.

609
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:34,130
Second, I'm gonna write down a fair salary
right here on this piece of paper.

610
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,767
Third, you nancies get to continue
your little science fair project

611
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:41,917
with virtually unlimited resources.

612
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,880
We don't really have a choice, do we?

613
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,829
No.

614
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:01,100
Double the salary.

615
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:18,535
The two of you will have a team of
scientists assigned to your departments,

616
01:00:18,635 --> 01:00:21,204
and you'll report directly to Dr. Selph.

617
01:00:21,304 --> 01:00:25,314
- Dr. Nicolas Selph?
- The one and only.

618
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:29,360
Dr. Selph, hi.

619
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:33,545
I'd like to introduce you to
David Thorogood and Ryan Cates.

620
01:00:36,048 --> 01:00:37,984
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

621
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:40,986
Your paper on the neuromechanics of
thought origination changed my life.

622
01:00:41,086 --> 01:00:45,223
- It's the reason I'm here today.
- Kiss ass.

623
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:49,826
Thank you. We've had a chance to take a
good look at your work on thought decoding.

624
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:52,662
And you must be
the brain interface expert.

625
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:55,397
We're very impressed
with your work around here also.

626
01:00:55,497 --> 01:00:57,445
Thank you, sir. You know,

627
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:01,135
my head patches really bypass the need
for any thought decoding work.

628
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:04,485
Is David even really necessary
on this project?

629
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:57,888
Mom?

630
01:01:57,988 --> 01:02:00,155
Yeah, baby?

631
01:02:00,255 --> 01:02:02,571
I miss Dad.

632
01:02:37,189 --> 01:02:40,092
- Hey, Jordan.
- Hey.

633
01:02:40,392 --> 01:02:41,526
What's this?

634
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:44,876
Ryan got wireless working
on the new head patches.

635
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,747
Crazy.

636
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:54,402
You know what's going on?

637
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:58,672
I guess someone is coming down hard
on Matthews about security.

638
01:02:58,772 --> 01:03:01,207
Apparently the DS&T found out
about our breakthrough,

639
01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:02,975
and they're trying to keep
a tight lid on it.

640
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:07,312
Everyone's throwing "national security"
around like a hot potato.

641
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:12,516
- So what are they doing?
- It's Matthews' solution.

642
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,451
It's kind of obvious, actually.

643
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:17,086
Every scientist working on
this project from here on out

644
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:20,722
is going to get a dedicated Listener,
making sure there are no spies in the room.

645
01:03:20,822 --> 01:03:24,439
They're turning
our own technology against us.

646
01:03:45,678 --> 01:03:48,561
The experiment's results
show that prolonged...

647
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,842
Two-way connection
carries a severe risk...

648
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:14,037
Recognize patterns in the code.

649
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,506
See, the subject might think...

650
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:18,541
might think "shoot," right?

651
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:23,378
But is he thinking about a gun,
a camera, a basketball...

652
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:26,447
<i>How am I supposed to work with that Listener
hearing every thought going through my head?</i>

653
01:04:26,547 --> 01:04:28,649
- <i>This is insane. This isn't right</i>.
- Right. Got it.

654
01:04:28,749 --> 01:04:31,099
<i>We are all being violated.</i>

655
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:38,458
Yeah.

656
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:41,193
- He was thinking about a gun.
- Oh. Sorry, sir.

657
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:44,310
That's all right. It's not easy.

658
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:56,686
- David, how are you?
- I'm all right.

659
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:03,310
Still weirded out by the Red Room and all
the Listeners keeping watch all the time.

660
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:07,214
- It's creepy.
- It's quite scary, where all this is headed.

661
01:05:07,514 --> 01:05:10,317
Can't believe they've got you
under surveillance.

662
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:14,454
What did you mean, sir?
It's scary where all this is headed?

663
01:05:14,554 --> 01:05:16,422
Damn that Ryan.

664
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:20,654
Spends more time groping my scientists
than doing any real work.

665
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:55,324
- How did you do it?
- I don't like this.

666
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:57,975
We were plugged into your brain
every day and never had any idea

667
01:05:58,075 --> 01:06:02,295
- that you were even thinking something else.
- I'm not actually a nymphomaniac, okay?

668
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:05,747
- It's as simple as that.
- I have to see that file.

669
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:09,217
Plus, thinking one thing
and actively doing another?

670
01:06:09,317 --> 01:06:13,204
You're talking about forcing metacognition
in a different part of the brain,

671
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:15,573
and you know that's impossible.

672
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:19,709
Buddhist monks can do it. They can
consciously control their blood pressure,

673
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,345
change their body temperature
just by meditating.

674
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,604
I can't afford suspicious thoughts
creeping into my head at work.

675
01:06:33,754 --> 01:06:36,291
Do you think Ryan will ever forgive me?

676
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:39,273
I've never seen him let go of a grudge.

677
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,430
But if he was to forgive anybody...

678
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,879
it'd probably be you.

679
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,520
I love blueberries.

680
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:16,358
They taste so delicious.
They're full of anthocyanins.

681
01:07:16,558 --> 01:07:20,762
They taste like blue spectacularness.

682
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:24,132
They're really good in muffins, pancakes.

683
01:07:24,232 --> 01:07:28,102
Blueberries in scones.
You can put 'em in your...

684
01:07:28,202 --> 01:07:30,351
Blueberries?

685
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:32,206
- Really?
- I was just...

686
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:35,222
It's better if you don't make an excuse.

687
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:11,642
Really?

688
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:14,110
There's a life-or-death emergency
at the Lincoln Memorial?

689
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:18,346
If they're reading our thoughts at work, it's a
sure bet they're bugging our apartments too.

690
01:08:18,446 --> 01:08:21,682
Don't say anything you don't want
my Listener to hear later.

691
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:24,618
I stole this file from work.

692
01:08:24,718 --> 01:08:28,788
- Okay, I'm leaving.
- They launched a new operation.

693
01:08:28,888 --> 01:08:31,812
They've got a plan for every kid
in America to get a nanotube injection

694
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:35,142
just like any other vaccine
before they start grade school.

695
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:37,476
That's great.
Everyone's gonna need injections.

696
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,261
Soon enough, anything electronic
is gonna have a brain user interface.

697
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:42,929
- That's not the real motive!
- Then how about locked-in patients?

698
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:45,097
Laryngeal cancer? Children with autism?

699
01:08:45,197 --> 01:08:48,066
15 million Americans have some
kind of communication disorder,

700
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:52,002
and we're going to put an end to all of that.
We've already done it. The bomb's gone off.

701
01:08:52,102 --> 01:08:53,803
Come on, man, you've seen
how it is at work.

702
01:08:53,903 --> 01:08:56,038
Every contradicting thought
has become a crime.

703
01:08:56,138 --> 01:08:58,573
The whole world is gonna be like that.

704
01:08:58,673 --> 01:09:01,642
- The Red Room was my idea.
- What?

705
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:05,812
They didn't un-invent the cell phone just
because the FBI could listen in on your calls.

706
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:09,615
Do you know why they've got my team
decoding the entirety of human thought?

707
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:12,765
Yeah, so I can tweet without a keyboard.

708
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:18,455
Implanting. That's the endgame.
The power to implant thoughts.

709
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:22,675
Into a person, a group,
an entire population.

710
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,943
They'll sell it to the world
as the power to communicate,

711
01:09:25,043 --> 01:09:27,011
and then they'll have
complete power to control.

712
01:09:27,111 --> 01:09:30,330
The CIA won't need to stage a coup
to rig an election across the planet.

713
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,833
They could turn any one of us into an
undercover assassin whenever they wanted,

714
01:09:33,933 --> 01:09:37,803
and they would do it all from
a computer in a lab, right here.

715
01:09:37,903 --> 01:09:40,906
Matthews lied. They've been
testing on humans for months.

716
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:44,542
They were stuck,
and we just unlocked it all for them.

717
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:47,911
This is a cure for war. Do you realize
how many lives this will save?

718
01:09:48,011 --> 01:09:49,279
It's too much power.

719
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:53,083
This work, everything that we're doing...
this is the end of freedom.

720
01:09:53,183 --> 01:09:57,534
No, it's not. It's the birth of freedom.

721
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:16,485
Go ahead.

722
01:11:31,573 --> 01:11:33,389
Hello?

723
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,685
His phone.

724
01:11:45,785 --> 01:11:47,920
It's in his apartment,
but he's not answering.

725
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,688
- Check his car.
- It's on the move.

726
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:53,171
- Where to?
- Not here.

727
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:57,905
- Why isn't he here?
- Who?

728
01:11:58,005 --> 01:11:59,522
- Santa Claus!
- Don't ask me.

729
01:11:59,622 --> 01:12:01,808
- He's your best friend.
- Not anymore.

730
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:04,733
- What'd you say to him?
- Hey, the boy's a couple of minutes late.

731
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,051
- Cut him some slack.
- I want you to go find him.

732
01:12:07,151 --> 01:12:10,668
He's not my responsibility.
Send a field agent.

733
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,083
- He's headed to the airport.
- I'll go.

734
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:21,394
Not alone, you're not.
We're bringing the cavalry.

735
01:12:28,619 --> 01:12:30,655
Daddy!

736
01:12:32,156 --> 01:12:34,124
You're heavy!

737
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:36,259
No more growing up without me.

738
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,848
Hi.

739
01:12:41,196 --> 01:12:43,865
- Where'd the car come from?
- It's a company car.

740
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:45,900
- We need to talk.
- I know, but not with Lana.

741
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,768
We can't talk at home either.

742
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:50,570
I looked up the venture capitalist
that Ryan talked to.

743
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:55,921
He died in a car accident the same night
we were kidnapped. His assistant too.

744
01:12:56,507 --> 01:13:00,011
I can't go back to work, no matter what
happens. If they knew what I wanted to do.

745
01:13:00,111 --> 01:13:03,280
- What is it that you want to do?
- I have to stop it, just end it all somehow.

746
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,414
- Dave!
- What?

747
01:13:04,514 --> 01:13:08,080
- It's the CIA! What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

748
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:12,350
- Find a recipe in <i>The Anarchist...</i>
- Daddy, watch me!

749
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:22,828
Look... I'm sorry. I really am.
I'm sorry you're so stressed.

750
01:13:22,928 --> 01:13:26,478
I am not just stressed out, okay?

751
01:13:30,534 --> 01:13:33,818
Look, I didn't come out here
to work this out.

752
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:40,008
I came here to get a divorce.

753
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:13,229
Mommy?

754
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:15,949
It's okay, baby.

755
01:14:24,283 --> 01:14:26,269
- You're late for work.
- So you're gonna shoot me?

756
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:29,819
- We didn't know where you were.
- So you come with all this?

757
01:14:31,656 --> 01:14:33,992
- Daddy?
- It's okay, baby.

758
01:14:34,092 --> 01:14:36,242
They're not gonna hurt you.

759
01:14:39,262 --> 01:14:42,613
Looks like this was
just a miscommunication, sir.

760
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,203
I think David forgot
to call in a sick day.

761
01:14:48,303 --> 01:14:52,052
You haven't used all your sick days
yet, have you, David?

762
01:14:52,771 --> 01:14:54,173
No.

763
01:14:54,273 --> 01:14:58,076
Well, good thing you're a government
employee and not a prison inmate,

764
01:14:58,176 --> 01:15:01,457
because government employees
get sick days.

765
01:15:21,331 --> 01:15:24,233
Look, I need you to know that David
never laid a finger on me.

766
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:26,668
- You wanted me to leave him.
- You were expendable at the time.

767
01:15:26,768 --> 01:15:29,517
I was trying to save your life.

768
01:15:29,935 --> 01:15:33,820
He's a good man. Be there for him.

769
01:15:42,629 --> 01:15:44,679
Cool!

770
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,252
This is actually really nice.

771
01:16:07,352 --> 01:16:09,937
You've been getting the money
I've been sending, right?

772
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:11,905
Yes.

773
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:14,488
Thank you for that.

774
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:22,294
- Hey, Dave?
- Yeah?

775
01:16:26,284 --> 01:16:30,802
Look, maybe I started too soon
with all this divorce stuff.

776
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:35,288
- Can you turn that down?
- No.

777
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:37,566
- Why not?
- They can hear us.

778
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:39,475
Who?

779
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:44,423
I need to get out of here, now.

780
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:48,081
Can we maybe just talk
for a second first, please?

781
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:50,884
Dave!

782
01:16:52,604 --> 01:16:54,472
Dave!

783
01:16:54,572 --> 01:16:57,288
Call Matthews. I'm going up.

784
01:17:00,677 --> 01:17:03,112
You and Lana need to get as
far away from me as possible.

785
01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:04,213
Where are you gonna go?

786
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:06,281
I think I have a plan,
but it's better if you don't know.

787
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:09,349
Daddy, it's loud!

788
01:17:09,449 --> 01:17:13,219
I love you more than anything in the
entire world. Don't forget that, okay?

789
01:17:13,419 --> 01:17:16,236
I can't hear you!

790
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,883
I should've taken you on that date.

791
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,786
I know.

792
01:17:51,685 --> 01:17:52,935
Where is he?

793
01:19:24,503 --> 01:19:27,086
Close your eyes.

794
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,424
Breathe deeply.

795
01:19:34,745 --> 01:19:36,628
Clear your mind.

796
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:46,237
With each breath, your troubles leave you.

797
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:51,241
Your worries leave you.

798
01:19:54,028 --> 01:19:57,079
Let go of your thoughts.

799
01:20:00,734 --> 01:20:03,485
Let go of your body.

800
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:07,055
Feel only your heart.

801
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:11,411
Your mind is clear.

802
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:14,414
There is only your heart.

803
01:20:15,014 --> 01:20:19,017
Beating... and beating...

804
01:20:19,117 --> 01:20:21,023
and beating.

805
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:24,039
And now...

806
01:20:24,489 --> 01:20:27,339
let go of your heart.

807
01:20:42,573 --> 01:20:45,442
- What happened?
- You fainted.

808
01:20:45,742 --> 01:20:48,424
It's a good sign.

809
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:04,294
The right action for the wrong reason
is still wrong.

810
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:08,084
The wrong action for the right reason

811
01:22:08,184 --> 01:22:10,734
is no more right.

812
01:22:16,257 --> 01:22:19,995
You know that place
between thinking about something...

813
01:22:20,095 --> 01:22:22,644
and actually doing it?

814
01:22:23,497 --> 01:22:25,366
I've been there.

815
01:22:25,466 --> 01:22:28,316
It's where free will happens, and...

816
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:31,285
it's in danger.

817
01:22:33,505 --> 01:22:36,108
If you go now...

818
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:39,859
you will lose all that you have gained.

819
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:48,188
Then such is my sacrifice.

820
01:23:04,163 --> 01:23:05,898
Holy shit.

821
01:23:05,998 --> 01:23:08,065
Not quite.

822
01:23:08,165 --> 01:23:10,781
Just semi-holy.

823
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:23,426
You look ridiculous with my haircut.

824
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:27,464
How's Jordan?

825
01:23:33,621 --> 01:23:37,259
I've been carrying this around
for two weeks now,

826
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:40,109
just waiting for the timing to be right.

827
01:23:52,305 --> 01:23:55,422
It's a little soon, don't you think?

828
01:23:56,942 --> 01:23:59,860
A lot's changed since you've been gone.

829
01:24:01,713 --> 01:24:05,284
I'm the head of the lab now,
just under Dr. Selph.

830
01:24:05,384 --> 01:24:09,254
And me and Jordan, we're happy.

831
01:24:09,354 --> 01:24:14,205
We're really happy, so now I gotta be
willing to step up to the plate, right?

832
01:24:14,657 --> 01:24:17,875
That's great, man.
I'm really happy for you.

833
01:24:18,727 --> 01:24:22,797
- So you gonna tell me why you're here?
- I want to go back to work.

834
01:24:23,497 --> 01:24:28,068
Good luck with that! It was chaos
when you disappeared, a full-on manhunt.

835
01:24:28,168 --> 01:24:31,037
They planted stories in the news, saying
you'd done all sorts of horrible things,

836
01:24:31,137 --> 01:24:35,273
trying to get people to turn you in.
Forget about coming back. They hate you.

837
01:24:35,373 --> 01:24:38,162
They're going to throw you in jail.
Or worse.

838
01:24:38,442 --> 01:24:40,644
There has to be a way.

839
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:42,959
This is all I'm good at.
There's nothing else for me.

840
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:46,246
It has been slow as hell since you left.

841
01:24:46,964 --> 01:24:49,300
I mean, we could definitely use you,

842
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:53,169
but I think they're just as likely
to shoot you on sight as to talk to you.

843
01:24:53,269 --> 01:24:55,685
I'll take my chances.

844
01:24:56,337 --> 01:24:57,420
Yeah.

845
01:25:09,749 --> 01:25:13,431
Hello, David. Long time.

846
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:19,106
- Well, at least they didn't shoot you.
- Not yet.

847
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:23,502
I took a bus to New York.

848
01:25:23,762 --> 01:25:27,432
Hacked into a couple
college student databases,

849
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:29,700
ran them through
facial recognition software

850
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,470
until I found a kid at NYU
that was a pretty close match.

851
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:37,140
I gave him 10 grand for his passport,
no questions asked.

852
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,842
Since then, I've been living
in a Buddhist temple,

853
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:42,845
trying to find a new reason to live.

854
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:45,627
All over a broad?

855
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:48,182
I never took you for the romantic type.

856
01:25:48,282 --> 01:25:52,653
You never know what type you are until
you lose the thing most important to you.

857
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:54,934
We need him.

858
01:25:55,034 --> 01:25:57,823
- He's the best BCI programmer on the planet.
- I don't trust him.

859
01:25:57,923 --> 01:26:00,643
We'll be listening to every thought
that goes through his head.

860
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:11,192
David!

861
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:15,539
David! Can't believe you're back!

862
01:27:18,696 --> 01:27:22,631
- He asked you.
- Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

863
01:27:26,036 --> 01:27:28,253
Congratulations.

864
01:27:35,478 --> 01:27:36,712
What's he thinking?

865
01:27:36,812 --> 01:27:39,102
I think there's something wrong
with my head link, sir.

866
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:50,257
What's happening?

867
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:53,740
There's almost no activity.
This can't be right.

868
01:27:57,228 --> 01:28:00,265
Connection looks good.
Everything should be working.

869
01:28:00,365 --> 01:28:03,748
Get out of the way. Get out!

870
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:23,852
There's this background noise
that sounds almost like a heartbeat,

871
01:28:23,952 --> 01:28:29,269
- but all he seems to be thinking is...
- "Breathe in and breathe out."

872
01:28:53,744 --> 01:28:57,195
Jordan! Your head patch! No!

873
01:30:06,315 --> 01:30:08,151
This?

874
01:30:08,251 --> 01:30:10,601
This is why you came back?

875
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,152
I had to do it.

876
01:30:14,252 --> 01:30:16,836
There's no other way.

877
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:30,221
Ryan... listen to me.

878
01:30:30,671 --> 01:30:33,093
The information in our brains,
it's too dangerous.

879
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:35,747
Open up a head link.

880
01:30:47,242 --> 01:30:49,792
A one-way connection.

881
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:53,495
I want you to know what I'm feeling.

882
01:31:03,989 --> 01:31:06,539
How could you do this to me?

883
01:31:08,926 --> 01:31:11,464
It's okay if you kill me.

884
01:31:12,764 --> 01:31:16,413
It's the knowledge in both
of our heads that has to die.

885
01:31:17,466 --> 01:31:20,105
You've taken everything from me.

886
01:31:23,204 --> 01:31:26,855
I said you've taken everything from me!

887
01:31:28,341 --> 01:31:31,492
- She's not dead.
- She might as well be.

888
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:36,363
You really thought you could undo
all of it, just like that?

889
01:31:36,815 --> 01:31:39,451
We never meant to create a weapon.

890
01:31:39,551 --> 01:31:42,087
You're the one using it as a weapon!

891
01:31:42,187 --> 01:31:44,723
This was your big plan?

892
01:31:44,823 --> 01:31:47,358
Come in here and nuke all our brains?

893
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:51,928
Look at them.
What are you gonna tell his parents?

894
01:31:52,028 --> 01:31:55,264
"Sorry, your brilliant son
is a vegetable now,

895
01:31:55,364 --> 01:31:57,967
but don't worry,
it was for the greater good"?

896
01:31:58,267 --> 01:32:00,816
Is this the greater good?

897
01:32:01,869 --> 01:32:04,953
Enter the command for a feedback loop.

898
01:32:08,041 --> 01:32:10,410
Don't hit Enter.

899
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:16,030
Back away.

900
01:32:22,187 --> 01:32:24,280
You want to erase my brain?

901
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:28,437
Well, I want to blow yours out.

902
01:32:35,932 --> 01:32:39,209
Draw on the count of three.

903
01:32:41,152 --> 01:32:43,202
Freeze!

904
01:32:43,688 --> 01:32:45,238
Put the gun down!

905
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:55,503
Well, here it is, Dave.

906
01:32:55,983 --> 01:32:57,618
- Brains versus brawn.
- Don't do this.

907
01:32:57,718 --> 01:33:00,534
Put the gun down now, or we'll shoot!

908
01:33:03,722 --> 01:33:05,558
One...

909
01:33:06,558 --> 01:33:07,760
two...

910
01:33:08,710 --> 01:33:10,479
three!
