make sure you call
the town council office

71
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,154
and tell somebody with a title

72
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,990
<i>the festival banners are
going up today and tomorrow.</i>

73
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,160
<i>And tell them the signs for

74
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,363
won't be ready
till the middle of next week.

75
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,632
There was some confusion about
everything being ready by this weekend,

76
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,134
but that's
just not gonna happen.

77
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,837
And whoever you talk to
at the town council office,

78
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,539
ask them what their title is.

79
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,442
I think they let the janitor
answer the phone there.

80
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,946
And very, very,
<i>very</i> important, Deena,

81
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,350
if Mayor Fisher calls,
give him my cell number.

82
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,287
Why aren't you in now?
"Early bird" and so on.

83
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,855
Shoot.

84
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,761
<i>Hi, Carol French here. I'm
at my mother-in-law's place</i>

85
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:53,097
and I'm expecting a battalion
of cleaners over here.

86
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,999
Oh… well, it's, uh…

87
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,736
It's… It's half past that now.

88
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,738
Yes, that's right.

89
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,440
The open house is tomorrow, so…

90
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,445
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

91
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:10,448
- What's that?
- The view from the watch.

92
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,716
Can you put it with
the other stuff in the shed?

93
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,154
You're not giving this away?

94
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,624
Your mother always said
it was ugly.

95
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,161
Why don't you paint anymore?

96
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,564
Let's just call
it part of another life.

97
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,105
I'm thinking, should I give
Brent Fisher a call?

98
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,976
- It's not even 9:00 yet.
- Yeah, I know, but…

99
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,045
If I call after 9:00
it's more like business

100
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,414
and I'm calling<i> the mayor.</i>
If I call before 9:00,

101
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,683
it's more like friendly
and I'm calling<i> Brent.</i>

102
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,519
Well, which is it,
business or friendly?

103
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,621
Well, both…

104
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,890
Friendly, in what time are they
coming over for drinks tonight,

105
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,892
and business in when do
they want to see the house.

106
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,428
It all sounds
like business to me.

107
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,699
- There's a few other
things left over in there

108
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,635
you might want to give
a once-over.

109
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,505
Oh Deena, another thing.

110
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:10,574
I'm gonna need flowers for tonight.
A truckload of flowers.

111

<i>The historical significance</i>

112
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,671
<i>of Wilby Watch
dates back to 1875,</i>

113
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,840
<i>when Neil Peter French
and a group of settlers</i>

114
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,243
<i>landed on this very spot

115
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,045
Yes, Stan, we know.
What about the investigation?

116
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,148
All we can officially say

117
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,686
is that certain individuals
became aware of the goings-on,

118
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,721
ergo we received
the information,

119
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,158
ergo the current official police
investigation is currently under way.

120
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,062
- Can we get a shot?
- Of what? Me?

121
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,833
Okay, kind of like what?
Kind of like…

122
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,170
Let's try one not smiling.

What are you doing with that?

128
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,320
- It was my mom's.
- <i>For god's sake, buddy,</i>

129
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,556
<i>it's a piece of junk.
Leave it for the cleaners,</i>

I'll call you later.

132
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,164

134
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,822
- Morning, duck.
- Morning, Sandra.

135
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,192
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah.

136
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,229
I've been working on my abs.
Give that a feel.

- Maybe later.

00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,477

Mom.

174
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,123
Mainlander or islander?

175
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,125
I'm not even an islander.

176
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:37,528
You are so the daughter
of an islander.

177
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,597
What are you doing?

178
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,165
We've got to get
the kitchen going.

179
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,201
Nobody's coming in anyway.

180
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,670
Maybe they would if the
dining room was open.

181
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,606
Everybody goes to eat
at "The Loyalist."

182
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,512
We're not leaving here, mom.

183
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,049
Is that so? What's his name?

184
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,351
Shut up, mom.

185
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,587
Mainlander or islander?

186
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,926
- Islander.
- Oh thank god.

187
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,797
- My little girl is growing up.
- <i>Shut up, mom!</i>

188
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,665
<i>Island weather
TODAY: Sunny this morning,</i>

189
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,801
<i>chances of showers
early this afternoon,</i>

190
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,704
<i>clearing later today with
fog expected this evening.</i>

191
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,873
<i>Temperatures steady at 22,</i>

192
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,442
<i>down to 15 tonight. Mainland weather?
Who cares?</i>

193
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,444
<i>No, just kidding.</i>

194
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,313
<i>Rain throughout the day,
heavy fog for this evening.</i>

195
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,091
<i>"Ossifer"! Hang on, Ossifer!</i>

196
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,695
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't…
- What sir?

197
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,763
Brent, Brent.

198
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,466
<i>Look, I'm sorry about this.</i>

199
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,168
A couple of business
associates of mine.

200
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,370
Yeah. I didn't rec…
I didn't see the car.

201
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,439
Right. Well, they're
just in for the morning.

202
00:17:56,441 --> 00:17:58,776
<i>Just doing a little
pre-lunch wining and dining</i>

203
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,811
before they get back
on the ferry.

204
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,379
So, let me take care
of that ticket for you.

205
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,114
- No, no, no, I just…
- Come on.

206
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,517
No special treatment for the mayor.
There you go.

207
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,519
All right. Hey, we're gonna see
you guys tonight, aren't we?

208
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,922
- Yeah.
- I can't wait to see that beautiful house.

209
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,557
- Sorry about your mom.
- Well, you know, it was a long…

210
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,561
Cheers. Guys, sorry…

211
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,886
<i>♪ …It's all about you, isn't it? ♪</i>

212
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,789
- <i>♪ It's not about me… ♪</i>
- Hello?

213
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,895
Oh, no, no, Mr. Jarvis.
You shouldn't be here.

214
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,065
An agent's coming over
with a family in 15 minutes.

215
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,367
You don't
wanna be here for that.

216
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,503
Oh my goodness, is that gas?

217
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,606
- What?
- You don't smell that? Oh my god.

218
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,608
The pilot light
goes out sometimes.

219
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,609
Open the windows in there.

220
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,878
But it's going very well.

221
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,282
Apparently there's two
families coming in today.

222
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,219
Oh, darn… if I'd known
you were coming

223
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,721
I would have brought
those transfer documents.

224
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,722
We should get them signed today

225
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,725
in case there's an offer.

226
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,062
You want everything in your wife's name.
Val, isn't it?

227
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:27,698
- Yeah, that's right.
- Where is she?

228
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,902
- She's out of town.
- You're both from off-island, right?

229
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,238
Yeah, west coast, originally.

230
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,808
There's not a lot
of us non-islanders here.

231
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,577
We'll have to get together
for dinner sometime.

232
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,447
She won't be… we'll both
be… we're moving on.

233
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,450
Oh well…

234
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,353
It's hard to meet people.

235
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,062
Anyhoo, so why don't
you drop by my office?

236
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,398
- Uh…
- <i>To sign the documents.</i>

237
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,268
- Well…
- <i>IF IT'S BEFORE 3:00,</i> try my office.

238
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,671
After 3:00 I'll be getting
ready for an open house,

239
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,839
so drop by there.

240
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,808
Now you go on.

241
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,047
I'll call you
if there's any news.

242
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,455
Oh, my god, oh!

243
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,756
Oh god, oh no!

244
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,326
<i>Up next is news,
followed by "Memory Lane" …</i>

245
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,562
- I just thought…
- <i>Sponsored by</i> Dover Beach Cabins,

246
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:34,063
<i>Wilby's getaway
from the fast Lane.</i>

247
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,232
<i>Today's seventh caller to identify
our "blast from the past" …</i>

248
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,436
That sounds good.
Yep, okay, bye.

249
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,273
- <i>…escape to Dover Beach.</i>
- Don't want to be going to Dover Beach.

250
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:47,010
- Why's that?
- That's where the queers hang out.

251
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,613
<i>Ever since they got the
boot off the watch,</i>

252
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,482
now they hang around the
change rooms for the beach.

253
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,350
- Give it a rest, Irene.
- <i>It's true.</i>

254
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:56,319
My cousin works
for the "Sentinel,"

255
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,321
I've got the inside
on the whole story.

256
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,657
Did you ever hear of "live
and let live," Irene?

257
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,494
We don't do that here,
thank god.

258
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,002
- Are you smoking?
- What? No…

259
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:14,938
You smell like smoke.

260
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,909
Does he smoke?

261
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,910
- Shut up, mom.
- What's his name?

262
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,545
- Shut up.
- Honey, what's his name?

263
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,748
Taylor.

264
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,161
Mr. Jarvis?

265
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,031
Oh, Jenny. Hi there, hi.
How are you?

266
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,200
Sorry, I thought
you'd checked out.

267
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,403
Uh… no, no, no
not till tomorrow.

268
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,071
Oh.

269
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,606
I was just checking the…

270
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,642
Seems pretty sturdy.

271
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,912
Sorry, I…

272
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,785
How's your mom,
your dad, everyone?

273
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,287
Deena, did Mayor Fisher
call yet?

274
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,258
Well, did you get in touch
with the town council?

275
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,760
What have you been doing?

276
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,828
What kind of flowers?

277
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,298
Oh, that sounds good.

278
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,968
Oh no, oh…

279
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,237
Nothing,
I'll call you right back.

280
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,575
Oh, no, no, no…

281
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,994
No!

282
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,834
Hi, it's Carol French
from the merchants' committee.

283
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,103
What do you mean,
everybody's at lunch?

284
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,807
<i>Yes, it's an emergency.</i>

285
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,879
Thanks for stopping by, boys.

286
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,682
So, where's the problems?
Same place?

287
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:41,151
- Yeah.
- Mind if I grab a coffee first?

288
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,720
I'll take care of this,
Stan, don't worry about it.

289
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,089
Emily, can you get Stan
a cup of coffee?

290
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,625
And if you want a doughnut,
take a doughnut.

291
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,060
- Great.
- Okay.

292
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,062
There's nothing
missing or anything,

293
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,166
<i>but there's something funny with
the lock on the door again.</i>

294
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,367
<i>- Same as last time?
- Pretty much.</i>

295
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,970
<i>Worse a bit.</i>

296
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,808
Can I help you
with something, Irene?

297
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,184
Those Hawaiian fresh?

298
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:19,790
- So it's worse, is it?
- Yeah, a bit, quite a bit.

299
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,692
- Quite a bit worse?
- Worse worse.

300
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,395
- Worse worse?
- Yeah.

301
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,430
Crazy worse.

302
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:39,009
- We can't keep doing this.
- We haven't done anything yet.

303
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,551
Not here.

304
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,587
I'm closing up at 6:00.

305
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,889
- 6:00?
- 6:00.

306
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,928
- Ahem…
- What are youse doing out here?

307
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,797
- The window.
- The window.

308
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,067
It's not locked.

309
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,970
Well then, there you go.
It's not locked.

310
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,971
True enough.

311
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:11,207
There you go then.

312
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,811
We better get investigating.

313
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:24,147
Carol and I used to
come here all the time.

314
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,815
She loved it here.

315
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,650
She said it was
a very important place,

316
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,887
because when you looked out there
you could see where you came from.

317
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,822
And if you can see
where you came from…

318
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,860
…you can remember
what you wanted.

319
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:42,799
Oh yeah?

320
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,472
So what do you think,
your grandfather

321
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,442
<i>just climbed up those rocks there,
stuck a flag in the ground?</i>

322
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,211
- It was my great-grandfather.
- Those were the days, huh?

323
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,681
Explorers and settlers and all that.
And now what?

324
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,850
<i>It's too bad it couldn't
come to something.</i>

325
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,486
- Come to something how?
- All this beautiful land

326
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,088
just sitting here empty
like this.

327
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,192
This is the only piece of coast
that hasn't been developed.

328
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,195
That's what I mean,
it's a shame.

329
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,312
Going to lunch.

330
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,715
Here comes one of the
queers from the watch.

331
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,684
<i>Irene…!</i>

332
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,027
- I'll have a…
- Double double?

333
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,396
Yeah.

334
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:12,289
No wonder his wife took off back
where they came from. Who wouldn't?

335
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,658
Irene, shut up.

336
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,965
Forget it.

337
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,176
We'll be seeing
who's shutting up

338
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,111
<i>when the paper
comes out next week.</i>

339
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,586
What are we supposed to
be looking for anyway?

340
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:45,255
- Evidence.
- Evidence of what?

341
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,190
- Wrongdoings.
- Oh, right.

342
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,626
They're making a circus
out of nothing.

343
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,428
I think it's only
gonna get worse.

344
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,698
- What is?
- Oh my, looky-looky.

345
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
What was I just saying?
Look at this, buddy.

346
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,702
What?

347
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,771
Drug paraphernalia.

348
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,113
Who put that there?

349
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,682
- The drug addicts.
- What drug addicts?

350
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,383
The only drug addicts in Wilby

351
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,619
are the ones who buy it in a
bottle at the "loyalist."

352
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,623
Obviously they're bringing
the drug addicts in.

353
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,559
Who's bringing
the drug addicts in?

354
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,097
- Them. The bad people.
- Oh yeah?

355
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:31,101
Now they've set up their
headquarters here at the watch.

356
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,337
It is a cancer on the face of
Wilby and must be<i> ecradiated.</i>

357
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:38,275
- What?
- You know, got rid of.

358
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,111
Right. Well, keep looking.

359
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,814
No, no, wait. You stay here.
I'll have a look.

360
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,518
All right. Right on then, buddy.

361
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,756
<i>WLBR Island Radio…</i>

362
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,528
Carol French real estate.

363
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,763
Deena, do you have a number
for Walter MacDonald?

364
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,500
- Who?
- <i>Walter MacDonald,</i> the workman.

365
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,602
Oh, "duck," the painter.

366
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,004
Yeah, yeah, he's a real Picasso.

367
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,473
<i>Everybody calls him
"duck" ever since high school.</i>

368
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,310
Because when he was little, he was really
short, but nobody calls him Walter.

369
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,213
They'll be calling him unemployed
when I get through with him.

370
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,482
- <i>Uh-oh, how come?</i>
- Just get me a number for him.

371
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,918
I'm gonna need you
to do something else.

372
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,920
You're gonna need a piece
of paper and a pencil.

373
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,156
- <i>You got it?</i> Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,791
- Get the town council on the phone.
- <i>Now?</i>

375
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,261
No, once I've explained
what you have to do.

376
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,768
- Do you wanna hear about the flowers?
- Not right now.

377
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,871
- Paper and pen?
- Oh…

378
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,010
<i>Get the town council on the
phone, someone with a title,</i>

379
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,046
and tell them there's a
problem with the banners,

380
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:53,015
and they won't be
ready for two weeks.

381
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,017
For two weeks, that's easy.

382
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,153
Then wait 10 minutes
and call back.

383
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:01,257
- Uh-huh.
- Tell them to disregard the first message,

384
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,794
that everything's gonna be fine,
that I'll take care of it,

385
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,364
and the banners will be ready
by the middle of next week.

386
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,200
Do you want me to say you,<i> Mrs.
French,</i> will take care of it,

387
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,969
or you,<i> Carol,</i>
will take care of it?

388
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:17,540
It doesn't matter.
Um… say Carol.

389
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:21,077
Okay, I was gonna
be taking my lunch.

390
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,212
- What time is it?
- Lunchtime.

391
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,084
Can you do this first?

392
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:33,456
- You got your highlights redone!
- Yeah, I did them myself.

393
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,526
Oh yeah. They'll fade in nice.

394
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,294
Chop chop.

395
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,712
- Ding-ding.
- I'm closed.

396
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:58,280
I just brought you your
coffee on my way to lunch.

397
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,552
- Dan, right?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,122
Sandra Anderson.

399
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,891
Been away awhile. Just trying
to make a go of iggy's.

400
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,961
<i>Do you remember iggy's?</i>

401
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,130
No, it was closed
when I got here.

402
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,999
Right.

403
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,168
Listen, don't mind Irene.

404
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,505
She doesn't know
anything about anything.

405
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,674
She really should
just keep her hole shut.

406
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,511
I don't know
what you're talking about.

407
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,651
Okay, well, we'll see you then.

408
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,789
Ding-ding.

409
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:48,698
Not another trace
of nothing anywhere.

410
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,766
Well, that's a lot though there.

411
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,604
- I'm gonna hold off on the report, though.
- How come?

412
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,007
'Cause I wanna get
these needles tested.

413
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:59,709
It looks like
they've never been used.

414
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,911
Oh… uh…

415
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,347
<i>We'll do another search
tomorrow then.</i>

416
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,516
Why is that, Stan?

417
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,953
You think there's gonna be a
lot of action up here tonight?

418
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:13,256
No, just… You know, no.

419
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,891
Come on.

420
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,160
Right right.

421
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,397
Thank you.

422
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,532
Oh… I should have
had the tuna melt.

423
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,534
This gravy's
yesterday's for sure.

424
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,870
I can't wait until you get
your kitchen running.

425
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,839
- Oh, we'll see.
- I'm telling you,

426
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,109
you get that dining room done, they'll
be lining up from here to Dover Beach.

427
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,444
- Emily's got herself a boyfriend.
- Oh my god!

428
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,747
- What's he like?
- Don't know, I just found out about it.

429
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,017
- She's sneaking off early in the morning to see him.
- I hope she's got protection.

430
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,220
We don't want her ending up like you.

431
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,389
Hold on. Hey, Mrs. corkum?

432
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,758
- Hello, Deena.
- You remember Sandra Anderson.

433
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,529
- Hi.
- <i>Sandra's running iggy's now.</i>

434
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,030
You should drop by.
She's gonna be doing lunch soon.

435
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:56,833
I've been away for a while.
I know you, though.

436
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,834
I went out with your
son in high school.

437
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:02,405
Oh yes, while he was
dating Pam hillman.

438
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,440
She was a lovely girl.

439
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,511
Bye, Deena.

440
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,214
Oh my god.

441
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,216
That woman wouldn't know class

442
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,418
if it crawled out of her ass
and started to speak French.

443
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,568
Hey, you're late. I've
gotta get out of here.

444
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,636
- Oh.
- Hi.

445
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,572
I thought you were Deena.

446
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,673
You wanna go for lunch?

447
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,810
- For lunch?
- Yeah.

448
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,478
We used to, you know,
go for lunch.

449
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,413
Oh, I had something.

450
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,251
- Sorry I'm late. Hey, buddy, what's new?
- Hi, Deena.

451
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,919
Oh you know, just…

452
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,322
Um, why don't we
go for some coffee?

453
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,392
For coffee?

454
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,895
I gotta pee.

455
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:06,936
I've got 50,000 things on
the grill right now, buddy.

456
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,638
Plus the mayor
hasn't called yet.

457
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,040
So are they coming over
tonight or not, I don't know.

458
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,909
- Yeah, they're coming.
- How do you know?

459
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,513
I saw him this morning.
He said they were coming.

460
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:20,849
And you didn't mention it?
Did you tell them to call me?

461
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,085
- No, but…
- <i>For god's sake, buddy,</i>

462
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,054
can we be working together here?
I'm talking about our future.

463
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,524
Our future?

464
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,504
Carol French.

465
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,942
Oh hi, Mr. Jarvis.
I'm leaving the office now,

466
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,178
so can you meet me
at the address I gave you?

467
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,015
10 minutes. Fine. Okay, bye.

468
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,820
<i>Time now for

<i>Registration

479
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,715
How heinous is summer school?

480
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,650
God, how heinous is algebra?

481
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,851
<i>What do they mean "a equals"?</i>

482
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,787
A equals apple?

MacKenzie, it's non-smoking.

484
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,960
There's nobody here.

485
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,634
- God, I hate my parents?
- Why?

486
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,837
They said that if I don't pass algebra
and physics, I don't get my car back.

487
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,973
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it's basically abuse.

488
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,376
Hey, can I take you
to the mall later?

489
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,678
<i>I wanna buy you something.</i>

490
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,215
- You don't have to buy me anything.
- But I want to.

491
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,351
Oh god, you two. Get a room.

492
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,587
Mmm… That's the plan.

493
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,099
There's no smoking, miss.

494
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,335
Oh, yeah, sorry.

495
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,172
Can I get another coffee please?

496
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,207
Oh yeah, sure.

497
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,548
- Is that him?
- Shut up.

498
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,920
- He's gorgeous.
- Shut up.

499
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,665
- Hello?
<i>- Oh… Mr. Jarvis?</i>

500
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,501
<i>Hi, come on in.</i>

501
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,970
I'm just getting ready
for the open house tomorrow.

502
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,841
I had cleaners coming this morning,
but if you want something done right,

503
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,542
you've got to do it yourself.

504
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,712
Unfortunately, the gas smell was a
bit of a problem at your place.

505
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,982
The people were a bit put off.
Gas will do that.

506
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,818
I had someone from the
gas company drop by

507
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,820
<i>and apparently
there was no leak.</i>

508
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,757
<i>So really it's just a problem
of dealing with the smell.</i>

509
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,993
<i>Now I can do that or you can do that.
It doesn't matter to me.</i>

510
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,423
One more…

511
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,930
Just sign here. There.

512
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:36,805
Okay, and here.

513
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,947
Perfect. I'll check on your
house when I'm done here then.

514
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,883
Perfect.

515
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,457
- Bye then.
- All right, bye-bye.

516
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:17,412
- Hi, buddy.
- Hi, duck.

517
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,450
Got a sec?

518
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,453
Uh… sure.

519
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:36,866
- How are you doin'?
- Oh, not bad.

520
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,735
- And yourself?
- Fine, better than some.

521
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,703
Yeah.

522
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,008
So do you have any…
Pull at the "Sentinel"?

523
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,345
What do you mean?

524
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,747
Like they're
planning on printing

525
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,449
those names from the
watch and all that.

526
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:57,553
- Apparently, yeah.
- And what is the point of that?

527
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,555
I mean, you can imagine
that's gonna have

528
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,557
<i>a pretty bad effect
on some people.</i>

529
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,994
- Like who?
- Hey, sexy?

530
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,800
- Duck, hi!
- Hi, Sandra.

531
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,737
Anyways, buddy,

532
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:17,206
I'm so glad to see you
because there's something…

533
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,576
<i>Oh yeah, you were saying
you had that trouble…</i>

534
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,879
With that thing with the…
Thing right there.

535
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,249
Anyway, I'll…
I'll see you around.

536
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,685
Yeah, well…

537
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,020
I'll catch up
with you later, duck.

538
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,191
Yeah.

539
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,799
- Bye, duck.
- See you.

540
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,464
Those jeans look so hot on you.

541
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,600
- They were expensive.
- They were worth it.

542
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:19,201
They make your ass look amazing!

543
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,270
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

544
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,040
Thank you for the stuff.

545
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,576
Don't you like it
when I kiss you?

546
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,245
No…

547
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,115
No, I do.

548
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,284
I do.

549
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,820
- You're so beautiful.
- No, I'm not.

550
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,289
Could we go back to
your place for a while?

551
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,457
My mom's gonna be
home soon, so I…

552
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,626
For a little while?

553
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:49,498
Yeah, for a little while.

554
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:25,034
Excuse me. Oh, it's you.

555
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,903
- Don't you have a phone?
- Yeah.

556
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,806
<i>Well, why hasn't anyone been
able to get in touch with you?</i>

557
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,441
I'm not home.

558
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,511
We have a very serious problem.

559
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:38,547
- With what?
- What do you think? With the banners.

560
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,315
- Oh?
- They're backwards!

561
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:43,152
- Backwards how?
- It's "Wonderful Wilby."

562
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,753
- What?
- You got it backwards.

563
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,922
- No.
- Yes.

564
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,757
I just put it
the way they gave it to me.

565
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,460
Who?! Who? On what,
on what, on what?

566
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,495
A piece of paper,
the people from the…

567
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,564
- The woman from the…
- Can you read?

568
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,200
Yeah.

569
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,771
What?! Fuck the flowers, Deena!

570
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,940
It's two words,
it's two simple words.

571
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,943
They go together two ways,
the right way and the wrong way.

572
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,713
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry. Shut up! You're sorry.

573
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,381
Do things the right way
and you won't have to be sorry.

574
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:16,819
It's that easy. Just do things the
way they're supposed to be done.

575
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,954
<i>That's all I'm asking.
All I want is</i>

576
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,790
for things to be done the
way they're supposed to be.

577
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,326
That's all I want. You're sorry?
You have no idea.

578
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,196
I work and I work
and I try and I try.

579
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,465
And I'm the one who's…

580
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,335
And what's wrong with
talking about the future?

581
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,672
What are we doing if we're not
talking about the future?

582
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,274
<i>How are things
supposed to get better?</i>

583
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:42,144
And he wants to go for coffee?
I don't drink coffee.

584
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,347
I haven't had coffee since I
quit smoking six weeks ago.

585
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,983
"And how's that going?"
Oh great, oh fine,

586
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,019
thanks, thanks for asking!

587
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,954
All I want is…

588
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,741
How's it supposed to be?

589
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,479
I don't know.

590
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,250
The sign, I mean.

591
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,423
The other way…

592
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,793
"Wonderful Wilby."

593
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:34,229
- Okay, ma'am.
- Don't call me "ma'am."

594
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,833
Okay.

595
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,505
Do you smell gas?

596
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:50,278
Good. Fine.

597
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,948
My job is done.

598
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,683
Can you go now?

599
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,353
Thank you.

600
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,112
I don't know, it's just…

601
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,653
I mean, I know seven years
is not all that long.

602
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,724
But at first, it was like…

603
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,426
It was like a perfect thing.
It was easy.

604
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:42,264
And then, mostly I
think it was my mom.

605
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,836
Her and my mom never got along.

606
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,777
Now my mom is gone

607
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,879
and I just… I thought…

608
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,615
I guess I…

609
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,119
I thought maybe
that would make her…

610
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,023
Make<i> it</i> easy again.

611
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:14,129
And then now…

612
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,970
I look at her sometimes
and I see…

613
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:24,139
It's almost like…

614
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,808
"Where did you go?"

615
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,405
I'm sorry.

616
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,809
Don't apologize to me,
apologize to your wife.

617
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,379
- I know…
- <i>Don't worry,</i>

618
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,214
a couple of sessions of heavy
petting in the back alley

619
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,885
won't add up to much more
than a night on the sofa.

620
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,920
We're probably just playing out

621
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,822
what we wanted to do
in high school.

622
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,158
You wouldn't even
look at me in high school.

623
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,365
All I ever wanted was for
someone to say "I love you"

624
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,302
and not want anything for it.

625
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,706
Somebody will.

626
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,683
We're not doing this.

627
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,785
That's what I'm saying.

628
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:47,422
No, that's what<i> I'm</i> saying.
That's what<i> I'm</i> saying.

629
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,125
That's a decision
I'm making, all right?

630
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,664
All right.

631
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,067
Good.

632
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,275

Oh no, let's just wait.

00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,359
- You're killing me.
- No, it's just…

655
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:42,431
My mom's coming home soon, so…

656
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:46,167
Okay. Tonight.

657
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,704
Yeah.

658
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:51,573
Meet me there at 8:30.

659
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,608
Okay.

660
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,112
Taylor?

661
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,983
I love you too.

662
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,563
Hey, you're cutting it close.

663
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,831
They're gonna be here
in 15 minutes.

664
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,833
Did you get something to eat?

665
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,137
I cooked some cheese
stuff and Sushi.

666
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,646
What?

667
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,885
What do you see
when you look at me?

668
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:44,092
Someone who's
not dressed for company.

669
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,040
Oh no, don't you dare.

670
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,043
Apparently,
she's deathly allergic.

671
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,678
If you wanna smoke tonight,
you'll be smoking outside.

672
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,014
Go get cleaned up, please.

673
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,487

- Mom, you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

682
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,476
I'm celebrating.

683
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,848
Yeah, and what
are you celebrating?

684
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,186
<i>We</i> are celebrating.

685
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:26,287
Yeah, well,
I'm actually going out.

686
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,257
- <i>'Cause this is extra important.</i>
- Mom…

687
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,997
Okay, what?

688
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,234
We are celebrating

689
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,268
that you are starting out

690
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,172
on your beautiful life

691
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,375
with your beautiful self

692
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,912
and we're celebrating

693
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:54,115
that you're not gonna make

694
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,618
a big mess of your
life like I did.

695
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,354
- <i>Come here.</i>
- Mom, I…

696
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:03,691
Come here.
Come on, come sit by me.

697
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,626
<i>Come here.</i>

698
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,666
What?

699
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,238
Here.

700
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,280
Condoms.

701
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:27,549
That's right, honey.

702
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,785
I don't want you getting too
attached to this guy, okay,

703
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,322
'cause I don't think we're gonna
be staying much longer in Wilby.

704
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,725
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

705
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,397
Why, did you already sleep
with all the men here?

706
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,233
Emily.

707
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,435
That's what always
happens, isn't it?

708
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,137
We have to move because you
have sex with everyone,

709
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,140
or someone turns out
to be a psycho

710
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,141
or someone's wife finds out.

711
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:57,312
Is that what happened
with that cop?

712
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:58,980
Stop that.

713
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:03,551
Everything is not
always about sex.

714
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,520
I never said it was.

715
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,323
Right, right, so then why
would you give me those?

716
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:10,925
So that you won't
end up like me.

717
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,762
No, I won't.

718
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,998
Don't worry, I so won't because you
are the last person in the world

719
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
that I would ever end up like.

720
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,271
What's the matter with you?

721
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,643
Some things are about love, but
you wouldn't understand that.

722
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,380
Emily. Emily.

723
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,552
Take these, take these.

724
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,456
Take these, take these!

725
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,891
- You are so fucking stupid.
- Take these, Emily!

726
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,960
- You are so fucking stupid!
- Em…

727
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:54,035
- Welcome, welcome!
- This is our daughter MacKenzie.

728
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,237
Hi, MacKenzie. You know buddy.

729
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,239
No, no, hello!

730
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,375
Yeah, you two met. He
works with your brother.

731
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:01,943
- Which one?
- Stan.

732
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,113
Oh! Right, right! You work
on the force, right, right?

733
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,948
- Duh…
- Duh yourself!

734
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,751
- So shall we go?
- Sorry?

735
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,219
- We're gonna go see the house!
- Tonight?

736
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:15,756
- Wasn't that the plan?
- Tonight? Well…

737
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:17,491
The open house
isn't till tomorrow.

738
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,627
I know, we were gonna get
in before the crowds.

739
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,896
Right, sure, but…

740
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,432
- If you don't…
- Fine, no, no, fine.

741
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,867
Fine, why don't we
just have a drink

742
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,870
and I've got a few nibblies.

743
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,139
A drink? Oh, okay! Twist my arm!

744
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:34,709
- Please sit down.
- Sure.

745
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,611
I thought were
just gonna see the house.

746
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,947
Be social for a minute! Come on!

747
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,949
Ah-choo! Sorry, could you…?

748
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:42,617
- Oh, what?
- Pollen.

749
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,820
- Oh… buddy…
- I'm gonna wait outside.

750
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,822
MacKenzie, just shut
up and get inside.

751
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,891
Please, Elaine, don't be
telling her to shut up.

752
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:53,227
- Pardon me?
- Now she says it to me. She got it from you!

753
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,430
She's not getting it from me! You
tell her to "shut up" all the time.

754
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,632
Shut up!

755
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:26,761
Hi…

756
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,820
Hey there.

757
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,021
I thought that was your car.

758
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,025
Got a couple minutes?

759
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,728
I'm-I'm just on my way out.

760
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,865
How 'bout a minute then?

761
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:24,686
- Here.
- What is it?

762
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,621
Rum. Go on.

763
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,591
- In a minute.
- I already had mine.

764
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,527
You have to have yours or we
won't be on the same level.

765
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,536
Why didn't you wear your new outfit?
Don't you like it?

766
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,538
No.

767
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,874
Yeah, yeah. I…

768
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,377
It's just… my mom came
home and we had a fight.

769
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,546
Forget about your mom.

770
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,816
- Listen.
- Listen to this.

771
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,653
Wait.

772
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,560
I love you.

773
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,497
I love you too.

774
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,571
<i>Sorry to hear about your banners.
That's a shame.</i>

775
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:19,440
Two words and he gets it backwards.
What are the chances of that?

776
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,610
- Is he dyslexic or what?
- Maybe.

777
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,378
I think it's better
the backwards way.

778
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,380
<i>Well you can like
the backwards way,</i>

779
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:29,650
but the backwards way can't be better
because the backwards way is wrong.

780
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,919
That's true.

781
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,489
But I hear they're postponing
the festival anyway.

782
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,358
Er… where did you hear that?

783
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,529
- What with all the trouble down at the watch.
- Oh yeah?

784
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,999
What do I know?
Don't listen to me.

785
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:49,203
- I mean, it's your baby.
- I don't listen to her.

786
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:53,041
- Speaking of the watch Brent, what's the story?
- This Sushi is great.

787
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,876
I don't know. You're in
charge of the investigation.

788
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,279
You tell me there, buddy.

789
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,448
I don't know. I haven't seen
too much out of the ordinary.

790
01:02:01,450 --> 01:02:04,185
- I don't think that'll be for too much longer.
- Oh yeah? Why?

791
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:07,054
- Um, Sushi.
- No thanks.

792
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:10,191
Just an instinct.

793
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,460
<i>I think when the
stuff hits the fan,</i>

794
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,129
and they publish the names
of the individuals involved,

795
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,066
- <i>I think it's gonna be a different situation.</i>
- Yeah, but see,

796
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,234
I think that's going to
attract more attention to it.

797
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,236
<i>Don't we want it to fade away?</i>

798
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,505
- Well I think it's a serious thing.
- Oh come on.

799
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,507
People have been getting up to,

800
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,509
whatever it is that they get
up to out there, for years.

801
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,144
- Shrimp?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

802
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,213
<i>Yeah, well, I think</i>

803
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:35,416
<i>we're dealing here
with a different level</i>

804
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,253
of deviant underbelly.

805
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,021
Why is that?

806
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,491
It's just an instinct.

807
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,226
- Well I think it's a whole
lot of noise about nothing.

808
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:49,063
<i>- Nothing?
- Yeah, well, I think</i>

809
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:51,266
it's a little short of
nothing there, buddy.

810
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,706
Buddy…?

811
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:02,377
Hmm? Oh, sorry. So sorry.

812
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:06,580
You'll excuse me.

813
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,582
Sushi, shrimp?

814
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:11,285
Oh no, thanks.
I can't have shellfish.

815
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,521
- Oh.
- I get hives.

816
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,357
<i>- I'll have some.</i>
- Oh sure.

817
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,325
Mmm. They're good.

818
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,967
You gonna have a seat?

819
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,838
Yeah.

820
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,552
I would have brought a bottle

821
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:47,488
but I gave it up.

822
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,759
<i>Didn't agree with me.</i>

823
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:55,229
Well, it did agree with me,
but on all the wrong stuff.

824
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,465
Mmm.

825
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,172
How you doing with everything?

826
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:14,515
Maybe it's for the best.

827
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,751
<i>I mean, once they publish
the names, right?</i>

828
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,920
<i>Everyone will know.</i>

829
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,691
Maybe next year
we'll have a parade.

830
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,700
Mind some music?

831
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,338
Yeah, sure.

832
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,047
So what do you like to do?

833
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,953
- What do you mean?
- I mean what do you like to do?

834
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:56,323
Do you have
any hobbies or anything?

835
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:58,959
Oh…

836
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,829
I don't know. Not really.

837
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,400
Okay.

838
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,237
Anyway…

839
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:21,983
Got another one of those?

840
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:25,652
- You allowed to smoke?
- I should think so. I'm 16.

841
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:29,390
- They're bad for you.
- So is this hellhole.

842
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,925
What's a hellhole?

843
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:34,428
- Wilby.
- No it isn't.

844
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,896
Hah.

845
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,599
What's a hellhole about it?

846
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,003
What's not?

847
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:44,338
The people.

848
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,007
Some maybe.

849
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:49,176
- The weather.
- In the summertime.

850
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,348
- The land.
- Which land?

851
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,251
- The watch.
- Not for much longer.

852
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,555
- Why not for much longer?
- Unless you like golfing.

853
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,593
- What do you mean?
- It's gonna be a golf course.

854
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,728
- Says who?
- My dad.

855
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,164
<i>These old guys</i>

856
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,599
<i>who were at our house this
morning are buying it.</i>

857
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,602
How's that supposed to happen?

858
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,537
Because of all the sex
and drugs up there.

859
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,708
- What do you know about drugs up there?
- <i>My dad told me.</i>

860
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,044
The watch has become

861
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:25,679
"a cancer on the face of Wilby
and must be eradicated."

862
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:34,455
- He said that?
- Yeah.

863
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,057
Huh.

864
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:42,296
- Are these lights?
- Um-hm.

865
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,231
Lights suck.

866
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,070
- Wait.
- For what?

867
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:54,975
- I just wanna wait.
- <i>Don't blueball me, Emily.</i>

868
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:57,811
I could get sick. I know a guy
who ended up in the hospital.

869
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,581
No, just for a little while.

870
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,250
Oh, great! You're a tease!

871
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,452
What, did you get that
off that bitch MacKenzie?

872
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,021
What?

873
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:11,258
- You don't want to be a tease, Emily.
- I'm not.

874
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,261
<i>I mean, you don't want
people to think that.</i>

875
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,595
<i>That's the worst thing
they could think.</i>

876
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:22,069
Here.

877
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,245
- It's warm.
- Just drink it.

878
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:35,182
There's ice out by the office.

879
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,819
Okay, I'll take care of it.

880
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,055
<i>Why don't you get ready?
I'll be back in a minute.</i>

881
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:47,728
Okay.

882
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:03,277
That's a good one.

883
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,492
When I told my wife she said,

884
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,794
I mean…

885
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,796
We never really had that…

886
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,266
<i>Kind of physical type</i>

887
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:28,202
<i>husband-and-wife
type of relationship.</i>

888
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,170
Right.

889
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:33,341
But when it happened,
I told her…

890
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,742
And I knew she'd be…

891
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,346
But…

892
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,448
She said, "I hope
you rot in hell."

893
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,958
It takes time for people.

894
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,612
It's rough.

895
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:17,151
- Sorry.
- No, I like it.

896
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,424
I like westerns.

897
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,729
- What do you mean?
- Something I like.

898
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,898
I…

899
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,433
I like western movies.

900
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:36,070
That makes sense.
You're kind of a cowboy.

901
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,540
A quiet cowboy.

902
01:09:45,914 --> 01:09:48,916
No, you should go. I… sorry.

903
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,285
No problem.

904
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,088
I got some things to do.

905
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,292
I'll see ya.

906
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,430
No problem.

907
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:07,267
If-if you ever need…

908
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,437
You know, I'm around.

909
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,940
<i>Good, thanks!</i>

910
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,942
<i>- Open it!</i>
- See ya.

911
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,611
<i>Open the fucking door!
Open the door!</i>

912
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:21,648
Open the fucking door!

913
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,650
Hey!

914
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,054
- You got a problem?
- Mind your own fucking business.

915
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,127
You all right?

916
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:35,296
- Stay still.
<i>- Tell him to go!</i>

917
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,297
- Go.
- My coat's in there.

918
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,133
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

919
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:41,469
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

920
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,204
- My coat's in there.
- Get him his coat.

921
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,306
Don't fuckin' move.

922
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,309
- My dad's paying for this room!
- Yeah?

923
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,644
He'll be paying for your
fuckin' hospital bill.

924
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,313
Get the fuck out of here.

925
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,255
He's gone!

926
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,326
Arsehole!

927
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,929
Aren't you your
mother's daughter?

928
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,265
Oh yeah, sure.

929
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:47,201
<i>- That's a great wine.
- Oh, it's Canadian.</i>

930
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:48,869
<i>Really?</i>

931
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,871
<i>Yeah, and it's a nice price too.</i>

932
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,174
<i>I'll make sure
I pick up some more</i>

933
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:56,243
- before you guys come over next time.
- Speaking of a nice price,

934
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:59,079
shouldn't we be headed
off to see that house?

935
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:01,715
And so sorry to hear
about your mom.

936
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,251
<i>She was sick for years.</i>

937
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,120
Oh, so is Brent's. It's hard.

938
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,122
<i>Emphysema and diabetic.</i>

939
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,325
<i>God knows how she takes
those needles every day.</i>

940
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,193
<i>I couldn't do it,
I couldn't do it.</i>

941
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:16,263
- You know, I had a co-worker…
- Yeah, the house?

942
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,731
You guys should get going.

943
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:23,603
Well, how about you all
finish up your drinks

944
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,472
and I'm going to run
over there ahead

945
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,541
and make sure everything's
as it should be.

946
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,944
Um… Brent, you've
got my cell number.

947
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:34,315
- Just give me a ding when you're on your way.
- Okay.

948
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,152
Buddy will entertain you.

949
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:40,921
Oh.

950
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:51,265
You know what, you guys?
I just realized

951
01:12:51,267 --> 01:12:53,099
I have a little errand
I need to run.

952
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:57,003
- You know where the house is, yeah?
- Yeah?

953
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,573
The door's locked, so just
pull it closed behind you.

954
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,642
All right?

955
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,116
- Jesus.
- Huh.

956
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,457
What's so good
about islanders anyway?

957
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,459
I don't know.

958
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:21,528
People gotta call themselves
something, I guess.

959
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:33,908
Do you know him?

960
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,482
- Do you want to say hi or something?

961
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,416
Nah, I tried that.

962
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,665
Who can figure people?

963
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,335
Your mom, she's good at that.

964
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:04,237
She knows people.

965
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,172
If only she knew herself
a bit better, huh?

966
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,678
She wants to leave Wilby.

967
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,679
That's what she said
all through high school,

968
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,682
but as soon as she left Wilby,

969
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:17,117
all she talked about
was coming back.

970
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,119
Right?

971
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,622
Right.

972
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,024
So she doesn't know
what she wants.

973
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,995
She wants to love and be loved…

974
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,599
Just like all of us.

975
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,192
Shit.

976
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,172
Oh!

977
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,942
Yes! Hello? What?

978
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,777
Who?

979
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:41,614
Brent, yes. Um, maybe
we should wait until…

980
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,784
Where?

981
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,786
Oh, yeah.

982
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:49,723
Oh yeah, I see now. Right, then.

983
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,229
Oh, no! No!

984
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,679
<i>Hello?</i>

985
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:50,083
Hi! Come on in.

986
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,103
Hey.

987
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,075
Oof!

988
01:20:21,382 --> 01:20:23,250
What you doing there, Stan?

989
01:20:23,252 --> 01:20:25,218
<i>A little "ecradiation"?</i>

990
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,721
These ones are used, at least.

991
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:42,435
This is something else. I have to
tell you, this is something else.

992
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:44,237
Oh, that's nothing.
It's a chair.

993
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,139
It's included,
even though it's junk.

994
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,409
That's not… that's not
Elaine's style of chair.

995
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:53,513
- No, but I'm loving this!
- It's creepy.

996
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,648
Oh MacKenzie, shut up!

997
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,185
- See?
- Brent, shut up!

998
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,587
What's that?

999
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:03,557
Oh, nothing!

1000
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:07,127
That's peculiar. What is that?

1001
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,496
What is that?

1002
01:21:15,603 --> 01:21:18,572
That's just left over

1003
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:21,574
from work they were doing.

1004
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:24,011
What kind of work?

1005
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,115
Big work, heavy work.

1006
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:30,617
- Why don't we just go this way?
- Is it included?

1007
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,489
- Where are we going now?
- The dining room. Chop chop.

1008
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:38,157
<i>Look at these moldings!
I'm drooling!</i>

1009
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,560
Look at me drooling!

1010
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,828
It's a bit excessive
on the woodwork for me,

1011
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,498
<i>but I'm thinking
a wedgwood blue maybe.</i>

1012
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,033
- No!
- What?

1013
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:50,736
No, it's just that… that's
just off limits… for now.

1014
01:21:50,738 --> 01:21:53,573
MacKenzie, please. Come on!

1015
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,175
- Let's go.
- What was she looking at?

1016
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:06,319
What's in there?

1017
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,226
- Rags.
- How big is it?

1018
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,762
Small. Tiny.

1019
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,403
Hmm.

1020
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:33,413
<i>- Oh my god!</i>
- Nothing! Yes, what?

1021
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:37,283
<i>- Look at this gorgeous yard!
- Lots of mowing.</i>

1022
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,352
<i>Oh, Brent, shut up!</i>

1023
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:48,995
Not particularly spectacular.

1024
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:52,231
Carol, tell me something.
Is that window facing east?

1025
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:55,001
- Then it'd let in nice morning light…
- Where is the girl?

1026
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,469
- What?
- Where is she?

1027
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,838
<i>MacKenzie is probably
looking around the house.</i>

1028
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,141
- MacKenzie?
- What?

1029
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,411
Everything's fine!
Everything's fine!

1030
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,064
<i>Right there in the living room.</i>

1031
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:00,167
<i>The fellow from the video store.</i>

1032
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:02,435
<i>He was one of the
ones from the watch.</i>

1033
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,004
<i>It's gonna get worse
when the names come out.</i>

1034
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:08,641
<i>Good, ship those freaks back to
the mainland where they belong.</i>

1035
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,843
<i>I hear you loud and clear.</i>

1036
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:28,061
Oh, hey, where's MacKenzie?
Where's Elaine?

1037
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,163
Home by now, I guess.

1038
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,266
So what the hell is this, buddy?

1039
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:38,137
- What is<i> this,</i> Brent?
- I haven't got a clue.

1040
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:40,740
I found Insulin
on these needles.

1041
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,077
Your mother's diabetic,
isn't she?

1042
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,447
I-I'm not getting
your point there, buddy.

1043
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,817
Stan's come clean
about the whole thing.

1044
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:52,918
Well, that's Stan's problem.

1045
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:58,091
You're a golfer,
aren't you, Brent?

1046
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,931
You like golf, don't you, Brent?

1047
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:10,503
Look… bud…

1048
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,341
I'm retiring after this term.

1049
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:19,278
<i>I was trying to make a
good deal for myself.</i>

1050
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,681
So that's… You know…

1051
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,650
"Golf is a good walk ruined."

1052
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,787
Who said that, Brent?

1053
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,258
I don't know, I don't know.

1054
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,360
Mark twain.

1055
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:37,964
I've never been much for golf
myself, but I like Mark twain.

1056
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,467
- You know what else he said?
- No.

1057
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,703
"Faith is believing something
you know isn't true."

1058
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,039
You know what
I have faith in, Brent?

1059
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:49,142
What?

1060
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,411
That you're
a good man deep down…

1061
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:55,482
And you're gonna
do the right thing.

1062
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,851
<i>You're gonna turn this whole thing
around and just let it fade away.</i>

1063
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,354
- Or what?
- Oh, I don't know.

1064
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,624
Conflict of interest,

1065
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:08,061
<i>conspiracy,
planting of evidence,</i>

1066
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:09,996
not to mention Dan Jarvis.

1067
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:13,733
Okay, well, what do you want?
What do you want me to do?

1068
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:57,843
Keep that under your
tongue, please, sir.

1069
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:32,679
Look, I don't care
how you kill the story.

1070
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:36,115
Just kill it! Yes, you can.
You're the editor.

1071
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:38,151
- Hey.
- What?

1072
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:39,919
Hold on a second.

1073
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,824
You can pay your own tickets.

1074
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,492
Yeah…

1075
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:50,062
Yeah, just say
you lost the men's names.

1076
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:53,265
I don't care… The dog ate them!

1077
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:54,801
<i>Yeah, I owe you big time.</i>

1078
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:56,703
<i>Yeah, big time. Yeah, right.</i>

1079
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,449
You know, if you
hadn't been there,

1080
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:11,584
if you hadn't cut him
down, he would have died.

1081
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,520
You saved him.

1082
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,691
What's happened to me?

1083
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,197
Let's just say it was
part of another life.

1084
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:30,170
Come on.

1085
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,947

01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:22,281
Yeah.

1102
01:30:22,283 --> 01:30:24,750
But he's gonna be
all right apparently.

1103
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,086
Thank god.

1104
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,555
We should send something over.

How was your night?

1108
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,139
Awful.

1109
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,808
Yeah, he's an arsehole.

1110
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:52,645
How far did he get before
you found that out?

1111
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,748
- Mom…!
- Huh?

1112
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:59,652
Not far.

1113
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,720
Arsehole.

Yeah, well…

1118
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:29,014
- I'm my mother's daughter.
- God forbid.

1119
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,224
So were you here all night or…

1120
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:41,661
Look at that kitchen. You could
eat an egg off that grill.

1121
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:46,065
That's what you're
supposed to be able to do.
