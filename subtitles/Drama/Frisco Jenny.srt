1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>Rendezvous, a little nest for two</i>

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
<i>Just up the road from True Love Avenue</i>

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,720
<i>The skies are blue</i>

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>And winter daisies bloom
where old plants grew</i>

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,440
<i>I'll stay for you</i>

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,260
<i>And we will wait to see the sunrise
with a top of hill of gold</i>

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,880
<i>And we will kiss beneath the ruby rain...</i>

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,260
<i>Oh, we will hear the wind before the call</i>

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,180
<i>Catch flying stars before they fall</i>

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,380
<i>Someday</i>

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,520
<i>When skies are blue</i>

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,380
<i>Will you meet me there on True Love Avenue</i>

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,900
<i>We will kiss beneath the ruby rain again</i>

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,860
<i>And when the wildflower bends, oh,
with the wind</i>

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>We'll see the red sunrise
on True Love Avenue</i>

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,980
<i>Will you meet me there on True Love Avenue</i>

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,540
<i>We will kiss beneath the ruby rain again</i>

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,480
<i>And when the wildflower bends, oh</i>

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>With the wind we'll see the red...</i>

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,060
...begin today our celebration
of the sacrament of baptism.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,220
We pray for these children,
set them free from original sin

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
make them a temple of your glory

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,180
and send the Holy Spirit
to dwell with them.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,920
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
- Look at Jenny with that baby.
- Reject sin.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,140
- Don't start, Rose.
- Start what?

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,200
You know.

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,060
Well, look at her.

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,220
And that clock has started ticking.
What's she waiting for?

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,020
- A husband.
- I know that, Eddie.

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,280
I just don't understand why
she hasn't found anybody yet.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,520
Profess your faith in Jesus Christ.
This is the faith of the church.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,580
This is the faith in which these children
are about to be baptized.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,920
- Do you reject Satan?
- I do.

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,300
- And all his empty promises?
- I do.

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,240
- And all his works?
- I do.

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
You have to answer.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,300
What if I don't believe in Satan?

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Or that all the works
attributed to him are evil?

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh, just answer, will you?

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,720
I do.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,720
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,840
She feels guilty about something.

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Guilty? About what?

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,780
I don't know.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,520
But she feels guilty.

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,440
And the bread's on top of the microwave
and it goes in the blue basket.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
I know where the bread goes, Mom.
I used to live here remember?

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,460
- And I already put it in the red basket.
- But I always serve it in the blue basket.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,160
- They're exactly the same.
- But... they aren't.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,600
They're two different colors.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
Okay, I'll put the bread
in the blue basket.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,700
- Where's Jenny?
- Who knows?

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,260
- Mom and I are doing all this ourselves.
- I offered to help.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
We don't want your help, it's your day.
And it's almost done anyway.

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,380
Hey, where you been?
I got somebody I want you to meet.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,500
I don't have time, I have to
help Mom and Anne with the food.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,360
No, you don't, you can help us clean up.

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,720
All you have to do is say hello.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,020
Hey, Tommy, I want you
to meet my sister Jenny.

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
It's nice to meet you. Your brother's
told me so much about you.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,580
Tommy just transferred here
from our New York office.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,380
New York, that's a big change.
But I'm sure you'll love Cleveland.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,280
It's got a very rich cultural heritage.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,220
I've got to leave but... would it be
alright if I called you sometime?

66
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,760
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,420
- Yeah, don't bother calling.
- Why not?

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,760
She won't call back.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,560
- Strike 43.
- Oh, shut up, Anne.

70
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,260
I don't know why we keep trying.
That guy is cute.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,040
If you keep on being so picky
you're going to end up alone.

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,780
You know... did it ever occur
to you that I might actually be

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,280
in a relationship with somebody?

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,720
No, are you?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,680
It doesn't matter if I am or I'm not.
Why does everybody always assume I'm not?

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,040
Because you never bring anybody home
and you never mention it.

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,920
The only people we've ever met
are your roommate

78
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,960
and that pack of friends
you do everything with.

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
If there is somebody,
what's wrong with him?

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,760
He's married, isn't he?

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,240
- She said it?
- No, but she didn't deny it.

82
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,040
And I could tell from her face.

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,020
I just don't believe
she'd do something like that.

84
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,060
I hope he doesn't have kids.
Do you know how long it's been going on?

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,800
What are you doing out there, Frankie?

86
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,120
Just making some phone calls.

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,660
She's not going to tell me anything.
I have everything she wants.

88
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Two kids and a husband.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880
I know.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,040
I am not involved with a married man.

91
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,880
Good.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Not that you're going to do
what I say anymore.

93
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,920
At your age what you do
is... is your business.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Like me. Sitting here.

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Having a quiet smoke
that nobody needs to know about.

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
Have I ever told on you?

97
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
No.

98
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,300
That Anne has such a big mouth.

99
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,920
If she has to gossip about something
she should at least get her story straight.

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,640
You should leave Anne alone.

101
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,360
You don't know what it's like
being married to a guy like Frankie.

102
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,840
I don't know what it's like
to be married at all.

103
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,740
- You sound like that's what you want.
- Doesn't everybody?

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,680
I guess.

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,320
It's probably why they don't always do it
for the right reasons.

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,940
What's the right reasons?
Somebody's got your back?

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,280
What are you, a Marine?

108
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,800
No, it's because you...

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,000
you meet the right person.

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,520
And when you meet the right person,
you... you go the distance.

111
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,120
And let me tell you about the distance.

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,760
Everybody changes.

113
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,320
But if you're with the right person
and they change...

114
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,400
you meet the right person all over again.

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Well, Anne did get something right.
I am seeing somebody.

116
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,840
Yeah? Who?

117
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,520
Just somebody but...

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,080
it is the right person.

119
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,760
So when's the wedding?

120
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,900
I don't know.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,560
And I'm cold. Going in, okay?

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,440
Okay.

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,780
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

124
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,500
Come here, I wanna talk to you.

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,120
Anne got it all wrong. I told her she
didn't know anything about my private life,

126
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,800
not that I was dating a married man.

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,140
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

128
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,320
- You believe me just like that?
- Of course I believe you.

129
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,120
You never lie.

130
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,320
You know... it's time for you to start
thinking about what you want.

131
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,340
- What?
- The china or the crystal.

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,100
I'm giving the silver
to Michael and Lorraine

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,180
so you and Anne have to decide who wants
the china and who wants the crystal.

134
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,100
- You mean when you're dead?
- Yes.

135
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,260
You know I don't wanna have
this conversation, Mom.

136
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,880
Well, maybe not but this isn't something
you can just leave till the last minute.

137
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,920
What are you doing? I'll drop the glasses.

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,160
I love you, Mom.

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,860
I love you too.

140
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,600
But if you don't let go there won't be
any glasses to give away.

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,140
The truth is I'm hoping
you take the crystal.

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Why?

143
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,640
Anne's like your father, they're careless.
It'll all be broken in a month.

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,680
But you take care of your things.
You're like me.

145
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,240
What makes you think the guy
isn't serious about her?

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,580
I don't know. She...

147
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,200
she didn't wanna talk about it.

148
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,040
I'm a fireman, you know, I know men.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,000
I can hear these guys on the phone
stringing these girls along.

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,140
I'm telling you, even if she's ready,
this guy hasn't stepped up to the plate

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,680
and she doesn't think he's going to.

152
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,160
I wonder why she didn't tell me.

153
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Oh, she didn't really tell me,
it just kind of...

154
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,960
slipped out,
and then she was sorry it did.

155
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,200
She's always been so secretive.

156
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,660
Not when she was little.

157
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
She was really open when she was little.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Yeah. She was.

159
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,680
I wonder what happened.

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,840
Who knows?

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Potato chips?
Bad time at the old homestead?

162
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
It was okay.

163
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,260
You didn't have the traditional
fight with your sister?

164
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,240
No, but we came close. She told everyone
I was dating a married man.

165
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,580
And your brother didn't try
to fix you up again?

166
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,520
He did. With a very cute guy this time.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,780
I need to talk to you.

168
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,380
I hope you wanna talk about
getting another roommate in here

169
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,440
because I don't think I can afford
this place much longer if we don't.

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,640
No, that's not it.

171
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
I've decided...

172
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,760
I want to get married.

173
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
And have a family.

174
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,120
I never thought I would hear you say that.

175
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,580
What happened?

176
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,600
I was talking with my dad tonight
and the things he said, it...

177
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
it made me realize how much I'm missing.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Did you tell him who you wanna marry?

179
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,040
No.

180
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,960
Well, don't you think you should tell them
you're marrying me before the ceremony?

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,520
Marian's daughter is back in rehab.

182
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,740
Son-in-law disappeared
and they have the grandchildren.

183
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,820
Poor Marian.

184
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,120
It's her own fault,
she never put the time in.

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,820
- We've been lucky with our kids, Ellen.
- It wasn't luck. It was hard work.

186
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,780
Who else is gonna teach them
right from wrong?

187
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,960
This would look good on Anne.
I'll get two.

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
How are she and Frankie doing?

189
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,520
Oh, the same, and she has to put up
with that family of his too.

190
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,400
That girl's got her crosses to bear.

191
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,200
- Has Karen found a job?
- Not yet.

192
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,500
It's hard with two kids.

193
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,940
I said I'd take care of them,
but she is a good mother.

194
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
- She wants to be with them.
- What about Bobby?

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,920
Well, he can't...

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,820
take a job while he's trying to raise
money to open his own repair shop.

197
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,100
It takes all his energy.

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,800
But at least they are a happy couple
and that's the most important thing.

199
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
- How's Jenny?
- Jenny's fine.

200
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,260
And I think she's finally found someone.

201
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,180
- No! Is it serious?
- I think it is.

202
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,680
She said she wants to talk
to us about something.

203
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,040
Then it's serious.

204
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,560
The guy's a bum, that's all I know.

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,140
- How do you know that?
- Because we haven't met him.

206
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,620
What kind of guy doesn't want
to meet his girlfriend's family?

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,700
- A bum.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,340
- What's he do?
- I don't know.

209
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,420
She doesn't talk about him.
I don't even know his name.

210
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,900
Anyway she does say she's got
something important to tell us.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Well, it sounds like this is it.
He popped the question.

212
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,980
- Maybe.
- It could be okay, Eddie.

213
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,280
Jenny's a good girl.

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,420
You know, you gotta lose some weight.

215
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,800
Why? I don't climb ladders anymore.

216
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,280
- They'll bust you.
- Yeah, well.

217
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,940
You coming over for a drink later?

218
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,560
Ellen and I wouldn't miss
your anniversary party.

219
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,000
Little taste.

220
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,180
More onions. Okay. I'll see ya later.

221
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,000
Alright.

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,220
No, I'm not okay. I'm still... carsick.
Once it starts it just doesn't stop.

223
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,720
You're not carsick,
you're just afraid to go in there.

224
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,140
So what if I am?

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,120
So you won't be able to do this
if you're going in ashamed of who you are.

226
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,320
I'm not, I'm not ashamed of who I am.

227
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,400
You always say that,
but I'm still kind of confused

228
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,060
as to why you've told everybody
except your family.

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,760
Because they... they live in a small
world and they like it in there

230
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,960
and I've just never found
the right time to...

231
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,200
drop the bomb.

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,040
You've been lying for a long time.

233
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,040
That's what you're really afraid of.

234
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
When you tell them it's gonna change
the way they see you.

235
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,160
- You need to do this on your own.
- What?

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,760
It's between you and your parents.
I'll just be in the way.

237
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,800
Just call me when it's done.

238
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,480
- Jenny?
- Yeah. It's me.

239
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, I know. Where's Kitty?

240
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh, she... she had to go
'cause there was...

241
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,600
an emergency at the school. Yeah, I think.

242
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,900
- What kind of emergency?
- A flood.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
A flood?
What's she gonna do about a flood?

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,520
- I don't know. Happy anniversary.
- Oh, thank you.

245
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,800
- Alright, come on.
- Okay.

246
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,800
- Jenny's here, everybody.
- Finally Jenny's here.

247
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,820
- Jenny.
- Where's Kitty?

248
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,180
She had to take care
of a flood at the school.

249
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,760
What does Kitty know about floods?

250
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
Can I talk to you upstairs?
There's something I need to tell you.

251
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,920
Please say something, Jenny.

252
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,020
We thought you were going
to tell us you're getting married.

253
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,020
But it doesn't look like that now.
What happened, honey, did you break up?

254
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,840
No.

255
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,680
Then what is it?

256
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,460
- What do you wanna tell me?
- This isn't gonna be easy for you.

257
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,100
- Are you sick?
- No.

258
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,020
Then what is it, honey?
What could possibly be so hard for me?

259
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm gay.

260
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
What?

261
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,320
I'm gay, Mom.

262
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
You're...

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,680
What?

264
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm a lesbian.

265
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm gay.

266
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
But...

267
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,140
But what about the guy?

268
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,400
There is no guy. There's never been a guy.

269
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,440
All these years...

270
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,000
you made them up and I...

271
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,760
I just went along with it.

272
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,700
But...

273
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,480
But I don't... I don't understand.

274
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,260
How long have you known this?

275
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
- Always.
- And I missed it?

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,140
How did... how could I miss
something like this?

277
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,960
You wanted to. You didn't want
to know and I knew that.

278
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,220
Didn't you ever wonder why you
never met any of these boyfriends?

279
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
You always broke up
with them before I could.

280
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,320
No, I didn't. I just...

281
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,200
let you think what you wanted to think.

282
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,500
I thought you were...
you were waiting. I...

283
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,160
- For what?
- I thought...

284
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,340
- What did we do wrong?
- Nothing.

285
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,320
You didn't do anything wrong.
This is just... how I am.

286
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,960
But you're... but you're...
you're like me, you know?

287
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,040
We even like the same things. I always...

288
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,320
- I always thought you were like me.
- That hasn't changed.

289
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,380
I am like you.
I'm still the same person, Mom.

290
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,200
No.

291
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,720
You're not.

292
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,200
You've been lying to me for years.

293
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,260
Your father will have to know
and you should tell him.

294
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,840
I was going to tell you both at the same
time but everybody was staring at me.

295
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,760
He needs to know before...

296
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,640
before I tell everybody else.

297
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,780
- You're telling other people?
- I have to tell Anne and Michael.

298
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm going to tell everybody.

299
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,360
Kitty and I wanna get married, Mom.

300
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,700
You're marrying your roommate?

301
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,200
She's not my roommate.

302
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
We've been partners
for five years now and...

303
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,080
- we wanna start a family.
- A family?

304
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Yeah. It's what you're always
talking about, isn't it?

305
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,120
And we want a big wedding.
With everybody there.

306
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,700
Friends and family. We want a wedding
like Anne and Michael had.

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I want... I want you and Dad
to give me away.

308
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,120
Do what you're gonna do.

309
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,840
But I'm asking you, for my sake...

310
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,280
not to tell everybody else.

311
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Not yet.

312
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,520
Why?

313
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,440
'Cause if you do, nothing
will ever be the same again.

314
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,480
Nothing is the same anymore, Mom.

315
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,940
Maybe not for you but...
but your life isn't here anymore

316
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,740
and if you don't like what happens
you can go away. I can't.

317
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,220
This place, these people...

318
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,200
they're my life and I have to stay here.
I have to live with them.

319
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,820
Oh, I love you, Jenny.
Nothing could ever change that.

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,440
But I have a life too and you
can't just change my life on me.

321
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,640
It's not like I'm living
in the past, I'm not.

322
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,780
I know times have changed,
anything goes these days.

323
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,120
I read the papers, I watch TV.

324
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,180
But... but I don't know personally,
anybody in this neighborhood

325
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,560
whose children have...

326
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,200
you know...

327
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,840
- Maybe they all left.
- What?

328
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,240
The neighborhood,
maybe they left the neighborhood.

329
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,020
- I'm sure they did.
- And the lying, all that lying.

330
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,100
Even though I know why you did it,
it's still a hard pill to swallow.

331
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,060
And now a wedding.

332
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,280
Starting a family.

333
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,180
I mean...

334
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,220
we're... we're ordinary people,
not, you know... rebels.

335
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,140
Neither am I.

336
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,640
I just want what you gave
Anne and Michael.

337
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,500
I only did this because of you.

338
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
What?

339
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,760
You told me if you meet the right person
you should go the distance, and I did.

340
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,780
I met the right person.

341
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,200
Kitty.

342
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,760
That's why I asked her to marry me
and now you're asking me...

343
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
to hide it from my own family.

344
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,500
If you tell them you'll hurt your mother.

345
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,320
If I don't it will hurt me.

346
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,040
What would you do?

347
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,880
I don't know.

348
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,320
Will someone please tell me
what's going on here?

349
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,480
- You really wanna know?
- Why else would I ask?

350
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
The married man and I broke up.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,440
I knew I was right about that.

352
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
How come?

353
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,480
He decided to stay with his wife.

354
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,140
Well, I'm sorry, Jens. But...

355
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,560
he sounds like a bastard to me.
I think you dodged a bullet.

356
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,620
You don't wanna spend the rest
of your life living with a liar, do you?

357
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,660
No.

358
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,200
But sometimes you have to.

359
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,400
- I'll fill the water glasses.
- I knew I was right about the married man.

360
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,320
Well?

361
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,160
- You did it.
- I did it.

362
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,100
- Are you... okay?
- Yeah.

363
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,020
Even though I lied to my sister. I am.

364
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
Thanks.

365
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,800
Telling my parents feels like...

366
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,600
being let out of prison.

367
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,900
Look...

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,680
if you've changed your mind
about getting married...

369
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm okay with that.

370
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Why would I change my mind
about getting married?

371
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,500
Your family. I know how important
they are to you.

372
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,380
No. My family is not marrying you, I am.

373
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,060
And I have never been more certain

374
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,760
about anything in my entire life
than I am about marrying you.

375
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
I wonder who proposed.

376
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,160
She did.

377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,800
She did.

378
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,920
She said... "Kitty, will you marry me?"

379
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,920
"Kitty, let's start a family."

380
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,280
All these years living a secret life.

381
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,740
I thought I knew her.

382
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
Then I find out I don't know her at all.

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,480
She's...

384
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,420
She's the same person. She just
left a few things out, that's all.

385
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,360
Eddie, what she left out is who she is.
Being private isn't the same as lying.

386
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,280
Well, you just asked her to keep on lying
so let's stop talking about the lying part.

387
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,960
I never asked her to lie. All I did
was ask her not to tell everybody.

388
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
She didn't have to lie to Anne.

389
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,280
And now that she's ready to tell
the whole world the truth,

390
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,380
we're just supposed to go along with it.

391
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,220
You remember our daughter
Jenny, don't you?

392
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,340
Guess what,
she's a completely different person.

393
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,520
Yeah, well, let's just drop it, okay,

394
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,480
because you know, she's doing what
you wanted her to do and that's that.

395
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,520
We have a life too, don't we?

396
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,020
Yes.

397
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,880
This isn't just about her.

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,760
No.

399
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,080
What do you think I should have done?

400
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,960
All you can do... is what you do.

401
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,040
What?

402
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,180
All you can do... is what you do.

403
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
What does that mean?

404
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,040
It means what it means.

405
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
Hello?

406
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,820
- <i>Hi, Mom. It's me.</i>
- Jenny. How are you?

407
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,240
- I'm good, how are you?
- I'm fine.

408
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,240
- How are things?
- Great. Things are great.

409
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,840
How are things with you?

410
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,760
Things are great.

411
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,320
Well...

412
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,300
I... I better go.

413
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Okay, dear. Have a nice day.

414
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,100
You have a nice day too.

415
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,720
I love you.

416
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,720
Love you too.

417
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,960
Why are we doing this? I'm freezing.

418
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,720
- It was your idea to get more exercise.
- No, it wasn't. It was Jenny's.

419
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,880
Okay, I'm done.

420
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,800
- How is Jenny by the way?
- Jenny... Jenny's fine.

421
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,620
She looked strange
at your anniversary party.

422
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,540
- Did she?
- Unhappy.

423
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,600
I didn't see it.

424
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,280
Anne told Karen about the married man.

425
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,840
Anne has a big mouth.

426
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,320
They weren't gossiping.
Our girls are like sisters.

427
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,680
- Did you ever meet him?
- No.

428
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,380
Well, at least it's over.

429
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,040
Anyway, that's what Karen said.

430
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,160
- It is, isn't it?
- What?

431
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,240
Over.

432
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes.

433
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,960
Why are you acting so weird?

434
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,120
- How am I acting weird?
- All secretive.

435
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,620
Like, I'm sticking my nose
in your business.

436
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,360
We've been talking to each other
about everything for 45 years

437
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,280
- and Jenny is like one of my own.
- I know that, Ellen. I know.

438
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,160
Then why are you acting
like I'm a busybody?

439
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm upset.

440
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,120
About the married man.

441
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,200
It's probably just a phase.

442
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,520
Is it somebody she works with?

443
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,240
- Not her boss?
- No, not her boss. It's another...

444
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,580
Another social worker.

445
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,000
- Any kids?
- No, no kids, let's go.

446
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Well, that's a blessing.

447
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,100
Oh, don't worry too much, Rose.

448
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,560
She's gonna be fine, she's got you.

449
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,200
- Dad. What are you doing here?
- Well, I was in the neighborhood.

450
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,940
You never come over here.

451
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,840
Well, I... I had to buy some equipment.

452
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,020
What kind of equipment
do they sell around here?

453
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,680
Well, you know, just equipment stuff.
It's not worth talking about.

454
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,920
You wanna have some lunch
or is this a bad time for you?

455
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,440
No, I'm starving...

456
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,540
and it is always a bad time around here.

457
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,700
The last stop for kids nobody wants and...

458
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,160
- I'm supposed to find homes for them all.
- Well, you always do.

459
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,960
You have too high an opinion of me, Dad.

460
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,100
Michael's coming around to help
re-build the fence next week.

461
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,460
- Yeah, he mentioned that.
- Yeah.

462
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,620
What about Anne and Frankie,
you seen them?

463
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,040
Not in a couple of weeks.

464
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,580
They're... they're going away next weekend
they asked us to look after the kids.

465
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,460
But we've got the bowling tournament so...

466
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,340
so I guess they'll ask
Michael and Lorraine.

467
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,420
They asked us.

468
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,200
Well... those kids are crazy about you.

469
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,160
No, it's Kitty that they love.
She's really fantastic with kids.

470
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,180
So... it's almost Turkey Day.
Your favorite holiday.

471
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah, I hope I can cook
one as good as Mom does.

472
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,340
Well, you're gonna cook your own?

473
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,600
Yeah.

474
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,400
Yeah, Kitty and I are gonna have
a couple friends over.

475
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,300
So...

476
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,800
what do you want, Jenny?

477
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,520
What do I want?

478
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Don't you know?

479
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,760
Ribs.

480
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,020
- What?
- Yeah. I know how much you love ribs.

481
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,700
I was thinking maybe, you know,
Chinese but if you want ribs...

482
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,740
I'm happy with that.

483
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,460
Yeah, yeah, ribs. Let's do ribs then.

484
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

485
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,520
Come on.

486
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
She's always been here for Thanksgiving.

487
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
Not this year.

488
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,320
I don't get what you mean when you say...
she looks happy.

489
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,960
I mean, she looks happy. What else
does happy mean, it means happy.

490
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,160
How can she be happy
with everything that's going on?

491
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,800
This is bad, Rose.

492
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,920
- What's bad?
- Wanting her to be unhappy.

493
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,340
I don't want her to be unhappy.
Why would I want that?

494
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,720
Because we are.

495
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,440
I couldn't believe that they're screaming,
"My baby, my baby,"

496
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,860
I climb all the way up to the top of
the stairs, and all I find is a dead cat.

497
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,680
- Jesus.
- Who was that?

498
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,240
The two bull dykes on the top floor.

499
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,760
- Don't call them that.
- What?

500
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,240
- Bull dykes, don't call them bull dykes.
- Why not?

501
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,940
Because they're people, that's why.
People like you and me.

502
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said
the two bull people on the top floor.

503
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,360
- What's eating him?
- Bobby, just let it go. Eddie.

504
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Eddie, listen.

505
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,440
Ellen told me what Jenny wanted
to talk to you guys about.

506
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,220
- I'm sorry.
- How does Ellen know?

507
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,980
Well, you know...
stuff gets around, but, you know,

508
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,320
I'll be there if you ever want
to punch this asshole's lights out.

509
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,240
- Punch Kitty?
- The married guy's name is Kitty?

510
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ted... Ted Kitty.

511
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,340
- Mrs. Farrell?
- Oh, my God!

512
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,580
- Barbara Ellen, you scared me!
- I'm so sorry. Do you remember me?

513
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,560
Of course, I remember you.
You went to school with Jenny.

514
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,700
And you didn't scare me,
I was just staring at this dress.

515
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,860
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's not right on me.

516
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,980
- You're getting married?
- Yeah. I'm meeting my mother inside.

517
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,160
- How's Jenny?
- Jenny is just great.

518
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,700
I haven't seen her since high school.
Is she married?

519
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,980
No. No, she isn't. No.

520
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,940
She's just... completely caught up...

521
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,080
in her career,
she's... she's a social worker.

522
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,600
She handles very disturbed children.

523
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,500
Complicated cases,
the ones no one else can touch.

524
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,180
She's wonderful at it.

525
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,240
- I guess some women are just like that.
- Like what?

526
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,880
More caught up in their work
than their emotions. Born career gals.

527
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,580
I don't... I don't know
what makes you think that...

528
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,000
career gals don't have emotions.
Jenny is picky even about food.

529
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,840
But she has strong emotions
and not throwing herself

530
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,140
at the first person that comes along is
a sign of character. Not a lack of emotion.

531
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,000
- I'm sure.
- The truth is...

532
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,260
Jenny is... is very involved with
a highly respected man in her field

533
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,460
and I wouldn't be surprised
if it led to a wedding.

534
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,640
- So you don't need to worry about Jenny.
- I wasn't.

535
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,220
No, of course not. Why would you be?

536
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,300
You know, my mother's waiting for me
inside Mrs. Farrell, so I better go.

537
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,100
It was very nice to see you,
Barbara Ellen. All the best.

538
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,480
Thank you, Mrs. Farrell.

539
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,460
You're late.

540
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,240
I know.

541
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,020
- You take 90?
- Yeah.

542
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,080
- What time?
- 4:30.

543
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,160
You never take 90 after 4:00,
you know that.

544
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,400
- Always take Carnegie.
- It's longer.

545
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Less traffic.
I always take Carnegie after 4:00.

546
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,660
It's my fault, isn't it?

547
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,080
You're the one who took 90.

548
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
I mean Jenny. It's my fault.

549
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,240
I know they say,
it's how you're born now, but...

550
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,880
I don't know, I wonder.

551
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
And I was her role model.
I'm what she's rejecting.

552
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,880
Now, don't hog all the glory, Rose.
I'm the man she grew up around.

553
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,800
If she's rejecting anybody, it's me.

554
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,140
I know you.

555
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,200
Excuse me?

556
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,860
I know you, and I know
what you're thinking.

557
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,260
- What's that?
- You're blaming me.

558
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,880
- What for?
- The lying!

559
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,440
I'm not blaming you for lying. I'm...
I'm just doing what you wanna do.

560
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,180
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Because it's true.

561
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,120
Then... then let's do what you wanna do,
Eddie. You never say what you wanna do.

562
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,840
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna eat my dinner in peace and quiet.

563
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,720
- That's what I wanna do.
- No, it isn't!

564
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,940
You... you... you want me to be
the bad guy, that's what you want.

565
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,420
It's always been that way.

566
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,720
I look like the bad guy when all I'm doing
is exactly what you wanna do,

567
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,520
but I end up getting blamed for it!

568
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,680
I kind of like that it's not white.

569
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,120
Looks like a cantaloupe.

570
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,640
What about that?

571
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,560
Oh, my gosh, that dress
would be perfect on you.

572
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,400
- Jenny!
- I love that. I love it.

573
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,240
All these dresses are so beautiful.

574
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,240
Well, you gotta pick the one
you love the best

575
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,600
because you only get married once.

576
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,600
Oh, my gosh, I love this one.

577
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,440
This is the dress for me. I love this.

578
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,120
I never thought we'd be doing this.

579
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,800
- Did you?
- No.

580
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,100
<i>I may have grown up
in a trailer park, Bryce,</i>

581
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,300
<i>but I'm warning you... if I don't get
Worthing Manor in the divorce</i>

582
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,640
- <i>everyone will know about you.</i>
- Hello?

583
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,040
Anne. What're you doing here?

584
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,020
- Are you busy?
- No, just... ironing.

585
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,880
Camilla told Bryce...

586
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,920
if she doesn't get Worthington Manor in the
divorce settlement, she'll expose his past.

587
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,480
- I saw Jenny this morning.
- Oh, yeah. Where?

588
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,960
- Nordstrom.
- Oh, was there a sale?

589
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,880
No. Something happened.

590
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,380
I don't know if I should tell you...

591
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
but...

592
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,280
I figured somebody else will sooner or
later so it's better if it comes from me.

593
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,120
She was outside
the bridal suite with Kitty.

594
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,780
They're a couple, Mom.

595
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,960
They were kissing each other in public.

596
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,940
I should've gone up to them, but I...

597
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,580
was so blown away, I couldn't and then
I didn't know what to do. If I should...

598
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,180
if I should tell you or not tell you.

599
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,120
And then I thought, well, you should
know before anybody else does.

600
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,200
How could we have missed it
all these years?

601
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,840
No boyfriends, hanging out
with all those girls all the time.

602
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,320
And it looked like they were
picking out wedding dresses, Mom.

603
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Wedding dresses!

604
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,880
They probably were.

605
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,720
They're getting married.

606
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,480
What?

607
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
They're getting married.

608
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,900
- You knew about them?
- Yeah.

609
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,480
- Since when?
- Since...

610
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,760
our anniversary party.

611
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,020
So all that stuff about the married man
was a pack of lies?

612
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,920
It...

613
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,760
It wasn't the truth.

614
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,180
- You two and your conspiracies.
- Conspiracies?

615
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,680
When we were growing up,
you and little miss perfect

616
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,380
belonged to a club I couldn't join.
It didn't bother Michael, he was the boy.

617
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,980
But I was the outsider and I still am.

618
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,580
You were never the outsider
even when you wanted to be.

619
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,720
- Wanted to be!
- You were always testing us.

620
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Breaking the rules to see
what would happen. Jenny was easy.

621
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,740
You have never loved me
as much as you love Jenny!

622
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,880
That is not true!

623
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,980
- Oh, I love all my children the same.
- No, you don't!

624
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,540
God, if you did
you wouldn't have lied to me.

625
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,480
You made a fool out me!

626
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,240
Letting me go on and on
about all that married man bullshit

627
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,440
just to keep your secrets!

628
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,900
As usual, the two of you against me.

629
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,480
What kind of love is that?

630
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,100
Mom. Whatever you've got
to tell me you gotta tell me fast.

631
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,340
I've gotta be in court in an hour,
and you wouldn't believe it.

632
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,400
This couple left their 5-year-old
son locked in their apartment

633
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,420
while they went on vacation,
and now of course they...

634
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,620
- Anne knows.
- Knows what?

635
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,840
About you and Kitty.
She saw you this morning at Nordstrom.

636
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,600
She's... she's very angry
about being lied to.

637
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,060
I know I got it wrong, I know.

638
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,900
But... ever since
you were a little girl...

639
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I've thought about your wedding.

640
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,440
I imagined helping you pick out
your silver and flatware, your china

641
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,620
and helping you pick out your dress.

642
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,620
Now, I don't even know
if you'll wear a dress.

643
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,460
Maybe you'll wear a suit or maybe you'll
wear a dress and Kitty will wear a suit...

644
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,360
- We're both wearing dresses.
- And where will you get married?

645
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,660
- Not in the church, it won't allow it.
- That doesn't mean God won't allow it.

646
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,880
The thing is...

647
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,120
I'm not good at making things up.

648
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,680
When I cook I use a cookbook.

649
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,020
And the way you dance,
I don't like dancing like that.

650
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,200
I like steps. I like...
I like dances with steps.

651
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,940
- Like, that one, you know that one...
- The conga line?

652
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,700
- Yeah.
- It doesn't have steps.

653
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,460
Well, but I always do the same ones.

654
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,620
I love the conga line.

655
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,620
I know the steps to that one
but I don't know the steps to this one.

656
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,240
And you think I do? Really?

657
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,960
I don't like making it up as I go along
any more than you do,

658
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,300
but I don't have a choice.

659
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,540
Oh, Mom, you can pretend all you want,
that nothing has changed. But I have.

660
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,740
And I'm not lying about
who I am to anybody...

661
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,160
ever again. Not even for you.

662
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,840
Because if I do...

663
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,960
I'll ruin what's good in me.

664
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,560
You... you raised me
to... to do the right thing.

665
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,900
And be proud of myself.

666
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Don't you want me
to be that person anymore?

667
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,800
The lying is over. You and Dad are gonna
have to make up your mind about me

668
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,940
because I am getting married...

669
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,740
and I'm going to have children.

670
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,820
I'm going to have a happy and full life.

671
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,800
And I'm not hiding it... anymore.

672
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,520
So if you can't handle that it'll have
to be your problem from now on.

673
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,480
Not mine.

674
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,140
- You knew?
- Well, I...

675
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,520
I mean, not for sure, but yeah, I knew.

676
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,880
Since when?

677
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,000
High school.

678
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,280
Well, then why were you always
trying to set me up with your friends?

679
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,720
Mom and Dad asked me to.

680
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,800
Well, in case you're wondering
they are not coming to the wedding.

681
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
And you don't have to either
if you don't want to.

682
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,920
Why wouldn't I want to come
to your wedding?

683
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,680
Because it doesn't stop there.

684
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,360
We want a family,
and I'm sure you do not approve.

685
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,600
God, Jenny.

686
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,260
Sometimes you are really dim.
I mean, has it ever occurred to you

687
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,420
that if you spend your life,
lying to people about who you are...

688
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,480
you never get to know who they are.

689
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,540
Look, I don't disapprove. Okay?

690
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm coming to your wedding.
You're my sister.

691
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,420
You know, I just... I really
was dreading telling you.

692
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,700
- Why?
- Because you're the most like Mom and Dad.

693
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,600
No, I'm not, Jenny.

694
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,200
You are.

695
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,040
So?

696
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,360
- I'm sorry.
- For what, being the favorite?

697
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,340
What?

698
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,720
Do you think you'd be getting away
with this if you weren't?

699
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,000
First of all, this isn't a stunt, Anne.
This is my life.

700
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,860
Secondly, I'm not getting away
with anything.

701
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,280
I am nobody's favorite, not anymore.
So you need to just... get over it.

702
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,160
Feeling unloved is not something
you just get over.

703
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,060
Yes. It is. You just have to grow up.

704
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,580
Why did you come here, Jenny,
to pick a fight?

705
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,480
No.

706
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,560
No, I... I wanted to say I was sorry
for not telling you.

707
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,660
I wanted to, but Mom, couldn't handle it.

708
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,260
We're sisters!
Why didn't you tell me years ago?

709
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,060
Come on, Anne. We never really shared
our secrets with one another.

710
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,480
And for good reason.

711
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,960
Instead of just coming to me when you
saw me with Kitty you ran straight to Mom.

712
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,520
Fair enough.

713
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,880
- Can I come in?
- No.

714
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,720
You'll over excite the kids,
and Frankie's asleep.

715
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,720
But have a seat.

716
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,960
- So there's something I wanna ask you...
- My wedding gown won't fit you.

717
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,960
I don't wanna wear your wedding gown.

718
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,560
I wanted to know
if you would be my maid of honor.

719
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,300
If you don't want to, it's okay but...

720
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,840
it would mean a lot to me if you would.

721
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,600
- You want me to be your maid of honor?
- Well, yeah.

722
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,100
I was yours, and you're my sister.

723
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
I know, but...

724
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,000
I don't know. I always felt like...

725
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,720
you acted like I wasn't in your league.

726
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,640
Anne... it was never that.

727
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,680
Okay, it was never that. I just...

728
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,320
I was in hiding. And I just really couldn't
afford to get close to you.

729
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,760
Dad!

730
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,080
I can't talk about this...
right now. I have to go.

731
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,200
Okay.

732
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,640
I'll call you later, okay?

733
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,840
- How long have you been with Kitty?
- 5 years.

734
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,560
When I saw you kissing,
you looked really...

735
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,520
really happy.

736
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,040
That grass is completely dead.

737
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,840
It's winter.

738
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
Yeah, I know, but...

739
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,920
it's always dead. Even in the spring.

740
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,740
Dad! Dad!

741
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,800
I gotta go.

742
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,920
Frankie!

743
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,920
- What are you doing?
- I don't have any cash.

744
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,580
Get it out of the bank like I do.
I'm not an ATM.

745
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,820
Why are you all dressed up?
Where are you going?

746
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,260
Didn't I tell you? Pete called.
He wants to talk to me about something.

747
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,240
- Business probably.
- Business?

748
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,920
You and Pete are unarmed security guards.

749
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,200
Don't wait up. You know Pete.

750
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,160
Why don't you ever water the grass?

751
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,340
Why would I water the grass in the winter?

752
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,120
Because you never water it even
in the summer and it's always dead.

753
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,760
If it bothers you so much,
why don't you water it?

754
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,680
Because it's not my job!

755
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,840
I do everything else around here!
You could at least do that!

756
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,440
I gotta go.

757
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,320
I don't understand why she hasn't called.
I've left 6 messages, you've left 4.

758
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,960
- 5.
- 5.

759
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,780
Just things went
a little too far, that's all.

760
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,100
She'll call when she calms down.

761
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,120
You weren't there, Eddie.
I've never seen her like that.

762
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,560
No, no. She'll calm down.

763
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,840
What's she gonna do? Never call us again?

764
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,440
I don't... I don't wanna go in there.

765
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,560
I want you here.

766
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,080
Hi, everybody.

767
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,220
- Kitty.
- Hi. Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Farrell.

768
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,500
Jen.

769
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,260
When you didn't call back,
I didn't think you were coming.

770
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,480
Of course I was coming.
Mrs. McMahan was my favorite neighbor.

771
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,060
- Kitty, you remember Mr. and Mrs. O'Leary.
- Oh, yes. Yes, nice to see you again.

772
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,620
Nice to see you, Kitty.
Kitty is Jenny's roommate.

773
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,160
- Oh, right.
- Kitty isn't my roommate, Mrs. O'Leary.

774
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,200
She is my partner,
and we've been together 5 years.

775
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,840
We're getting married.

776
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,000
We're a little bit old fashioned so we figured
we'd tie the knot before starting a family.

777
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,860
Can I talk to you a minute?

778
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,560
- I was just gonna go in...
- I wanna talk first.

779
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,700
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt your mother?

780
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,080
- How am I hurting her?
- By making a scene at a funeral.

781
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,140
Stutzman's is a place for grief.

782
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,020
If you wanna humiliate your mother,
go try and do it someplace else.

783
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,560
I'm sorry if telling people who I am
and how I live is humiliating.

784
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,040
But I am not gonna pretend to be somebody
else anymore just to make you feel okay.

785
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,600
Why is it always about you?
It's about her too.

786
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,280
We called you over and over again,
why didn't you reply?

787
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,040
How do you think she felt when you walked
away from her in the arcade the other day?

788
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,720
Why is it always about her?
Isn't there a you in this?

789
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,680
Why don't you stop hiding behind Mom
and tell me how it's about you?

790
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,240
Well, I will... I will tell you
about how I feel. It's not how I live.

791
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,040
I don't understand any of it.
And I don't understand you.

792
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,820
You're getting married, but I...

793
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,660
I don't know who's who.

794
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
- Who's who?
- Yeah, yeah. You're both feminine girls.

795
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,260
And I don't know. I don't know who's...
I don't know what you do.

796
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,400
- What we do?
- And I don't want to. I just...

797
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,480
I mean, you're my daughter and...
I just don't wanna think about it.

798
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,940
I mean, I spend enough time
at that firehouse. Men are animals.

799
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,980
It's what they think about
when they look at porno movies.

800
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,620
But if you were marrying a guy, I wouldn't
think about it. I'd know what you do.

801
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,020
When I was a kid, I used to hate
to think about you and Mom in bed.

802
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,040
It gave me the creeps,
so I think I know how you feel.

803
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,660
Let me put your mind at rest. Hey, Kitty.

804
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,360
My dad wants to know
if one of us straps it on in bed.

805
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,160
I'm so sorry, Dad.
She's a little bit funny.

806
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,080
She doesn't like to tell people
what she does or doesn't do in bed!

807
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,620
I don't know who you are anymore.

808
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,240
And I don't know if I care.

809
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,580
- What's happened to you?
- I'll tell you what's happened. I grew up.

810
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,340
I used to care so much about what the two
of you thought but not anymore. Why would I?

811
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,940
How dare you talk to me
about meeting the right person.

812
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,480
Do you know who you meet
every time you or Mom change?

813
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,960
The same couple of lying cowards.

814
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,200
From now on, I only care
about what I think and what I do.

815
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,440
And if you don't like it,
then you can get out of my life.

816
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,300
Believe me, I will not miss you,
it will be a relief.

817
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,520
If all you can do is tolerate me
I will be happier when you're gone.

818
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,640
Well, it was nice... seeing you all again.

819
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,640
I have to go.

820
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,400
- Your mother will come around.
- No, she won't.

821
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,500
They never do or say anything without
the other and now he'll never come around.

822
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,520
- Give him time.
- You don't know him.

823
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,880
He lets a lot of stuff go but...

824
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,340
I called him out tonight. I...

825
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,560
I made him look like a fool in public
and now he'll never get over that, and...

826
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,520
he hardly ever shuts the door
but when he does, it stays shut.

827
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,800
Not that I care. Because I'm not
apologizing to anybody for anything.

828
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,760
We have to talk about this, Eddie.

829
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,640
I already told you. I got nothing to say.

830
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,640
I'm not trying to defend her.
She said ter...

831
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,700
Rose. Are you deaf? I just told you,
I've got nothing to say. I mean it.

832
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,320
So don't bring it up with me again. Ever.

833
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,740
Rose.

834
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,880
- Rose.
- Shit!

835
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,860
Rose.

836
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,320
Hi, Ellen. Hi.

837
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,580
I've been so worried.

838
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,240
I left messages all week,
but you never called back.

839
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,500
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

840
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,380
How can you be fine after that
disgraceful incident at Stutzman's?

841
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,540
The things she said were... unforgivable.

842
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,660
I just hope you're not blaming
yourselves for any of this because...

843
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,240
you've both been great parents.

844
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,180
Did you know about them before?

845
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,920
We knew before.

846
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,340
I'd have lied about the married man too.

847
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,120
Well, you're doing the right thing.

848
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,720
- What am I doing?
- Turning your back on all of it.

849
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,800
I can't talk now, Ellen, I have to go.

850
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,800
Christmas will be hard, but just remember
you're doing the right thing.

851
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,320
And any time you wanna talk,
I'm right here.

852
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,640
- Hey, Eddie. How you doing?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

853
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,020
Did you tell the guys what happened
at Stutzman's the other day?

854
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,900
No. Come on, Eddie.

855
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,140
I'd never talk about your private business
with anybody. You know that.

856
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,460
They don't... they don't know
anything. But...

857
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,200
Listen, Eddie, I gotta tell you.
I think this whole thing stinks.

858
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,060
As good as you and Rose have been

859
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,520
this is the way Jenny turns around
and pays you back?

860
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,880
Yeah. I don't wanna talk about it.

861
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,560
No. Okay.

862
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,240
You know, it's funny. Her name is Kitty.

863
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,440
What?

864
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,260
The girl's name is Kitty.

865
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,080
I mean, first Jenny was with a married
man, and his name was Kitty.

866
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,760
Now, her name is Kitty.

867
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,380
Hello.

868
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,640
Hi, honey.

869
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,320
Hi, Mom. What's up?

870
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,320
Nothing, I just called to see how you are.

871
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,020
- <i>Fine, and you?</i>
- I'm fine. How are the kids?

872
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,480
Fine.

873
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,040
And... Frankie?

874
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,520
Frankie's fine.

875
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,160
Mom, did you call for a reason
'cause I'm standing in the...

876
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,900
driveway, and it's raining.

877
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,800
And I have a pile of groceries
and a sleeping baby.

878
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,040
No. No reason, it's not...
raining here yet though.

879
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,860
I just called to say hello.

880
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:54,120
Okay. I'll call you back later.

881
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,440
- I love you, Anne.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

882
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,000
Okay. What do you think?

883
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,240
It's perfect.

884
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,820
I've always dreamed
of wearing a dress like this.

885
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,120
Oh, you look beautiful.

886
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,340
Well, now I don't know
who looks more beautiful.

887
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,000
- Is this a double wedding?
- Yes.

888
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,120
Then I'll leave you alone to think. I know
you'll want to come back with your mothers.

889
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,000
This dress isn't right. It's not right.
It's too traditional.

890
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,960
- Well, what's wrong with traditional?
- You wanna wear the tux?

891
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,420
My mother's not here either, Jenny.

892
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,280
I know.

893
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,080
Your mother's in Portland. Mine is 20
minutes up the road in rush hour traffic.

894
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,600
- Tell me something.
- If it's about Mom, I don't wanna hear it.

895
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,640
It's not about Mom.
I know you live in a condo...

896
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,040
but if you had grass
would it be dead or alive?

897
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,940
It would be alive.

898
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,100
Just as I thought.

899
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,840
Happy people do not have dead grass.

900
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,360
I quit the bowling team.

901
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,400
Why?

902
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,680
They're talking behind my back.

903
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,440
Can you do that?

904
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,400
- Do what?
- Quit the bowling team.

905
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,440
You're the treasurer.

906
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,600
Yes. I can do that.

907
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,880
Don't you wanna know
what they're saying behind my back?

908
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,360
No.

909
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,480
You can't just not talk about this, Eddie!

910
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,400
We've lost our daughter!

911
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,000
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Anne. It's me.</i>

912
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,480
- Hi, Mom. How are you?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

913
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,080
Doing a little... house work.

914
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,260
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

915
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,380
How about Frankie and the kids? They okay?

916
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,900
They're fine.

917
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,260
Have you seen Michael and Lorraine at all?

918
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,480
For God's sake, Mom, if you wanna know
how Jenny is, call her. Don't call me.

919
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,900
<i>I know that's what all
these calls are about.</i>

920
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,580
Listen, there's something I...

921
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,200
I have to do. I'll call you later, okay?

922
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,360
Okay. I love you, Anne.

923
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,800
Oh, my God. Will you please stop saying that,
it's turned into your personal greeting!

924
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,260
- I'm sorry. I just wanted you to know.
- <i>Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I know.</i>

925
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,480
We all love each other,
and I have to go. Goodbye.

926
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,660
And they never talk about it. Not a word.

927
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,220
I wouldn't either if it was my daughter.

928
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,240
They were such good parents.

929
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,960
Well, they must have done something wrong.

930
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,680
We've all had problems with our kids,
but nothing like this.

931
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,580
I really feel sorry for them.

932
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,580
And this wedding is embarrassing enough

933
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,740
but those two are planning
on having children.

934
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,420
How can they have a normal life
growing up in that house?

935
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,460
It isn't right.

936
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,080
Since when did you two become such
big experts on what's normal and right?

937
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,160
Rose. We didn't mean anything.
We're just worried about you.

938
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,220
Tell me, Marion. Is it normal
and right for your daughter

939
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,260
to get pregnant by every passing stranger
and leave you to raise the kids?

940
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,160
Or for... for Karen and her bum
of a husband to never get a job

941
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,480
and... and rob you and Denny of every
last penny of your retirement savings!

942
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,220
That's all normal and right just because
the men sleep with women!

943
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,540
And the women sleep with men!

944
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,540
But Jenny, who is... who is... who is...

945
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,700
is generous and kind
and has never hurt anyone...

946
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:44,760
isn't normal and right, because she
wants to marry the woman she loves.

947
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,080
Jenny is good. And I love her.

948
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,140
And the only thing
that isn't normal and right is...

949
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,220
is me turning my back on that.

950
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,920
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

951
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,000
Hello.

952
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,240
<i>It's Mom. Can you come down?</i>

953
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,880
I saw a dress.

954
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,020
Months ago, I saw a wedding dress.

955
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,840
I knew you'd look good in.
You still might be able to get it.

956
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,080
I'm sorry, Jenny.

957
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,920
I'm so sorry for all of it.

958
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,320
And if you'll let me. I'd like to help you
pick out your wedding dress.

959
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,360
I wanna be part of your marriage.

960
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,400
I wanna be part of everything
you do for the rest of your life.

961
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,280
- You're late. You take 90 again?
- No. I took Carnegie.

962
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:09,240
Oh, well. Traffic on Carnegie
can be pretty bad after 3:00 too.

963
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,840
I wasn't stuck in traffic.

964
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,280
I was with Jenny.

965
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,320
I want us to be a part of the wedding.

966
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,320
We've always done everything together
for as long as we've been married.

967
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,040
But...

968
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,680
I'll do this alone if I have to.

969
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,920
- At least talk to me about it.
- No.

970
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,920
No.

971
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,320
No, you've made your choice,
I've made mine.

972
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,160
I don't wanna explain it to anybody.

973
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,500
- What are you so happy about, Eddie?
- What?

974
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,040
Nothing. Just a joke.

975
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,480
- Why isn't Denny O'Leary here today?
- He changed his shift yesterday.

976
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:11,120
- How come?
- I don't know. Said it was personal.

977
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,420
I've been on with him
since we were probies together.

978
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,480
Lieutenant said he asked to change his
shift and wouldn't take no for an answer.

979
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,640
I've known him since we were
in first grade together.

980
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,200
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

981
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,560
That's a long time.

982
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,040
Yeah. It is.

983
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,300
- What's that?
- Oh, look, you're awake.

984
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,280
- What?
- Get up. I want to show you something.

985
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,680
Are you crazy? Do you have any idea
what time I went to bed last night?

986
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,840
I said, get up.

987
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,080
Look outside.

988
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,520
At what?

989
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,280
- The grass.
- What about the grass?

990
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,080
It's green.

991
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,780
You think I care what color the grass is?

992
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,160
No. I don't.

993
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,840
- What are you doing?
- Packing your stuff. You're moving out.

994
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,640
- What?
- I don't wanna be married to you anymore.

995
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,640
I would leave, but I don't think it's good
to move the kids so you have to go.

996
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,660
Come on, Anne,
I know things haven't been...

997
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,040
Stop. I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

998
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,800
You can't just kick me out
without talking about it.

999
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,020
Why would we start talking now.
We haven't talked in years!

1000
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,800
'Cause I have a right to know
why you're doing this.

1001
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,180
- The grass.
- The grass?

1002
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,420
Yes. When I looked
at the dead grass, I realized...

1003
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,540
I was unhappy. Happy people
don't have dead grass.

1004
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,820
And... and then it was like,
the chicken and the egg.

1005
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,360
I couldn't figure out which came first.
Happiness or green grass.

1006
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:08,600
So I started watering it. And the more
I started watering it, the happier I felt.

1007
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,840
And then it came back to life.

1008
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,320
I don't blame you for kicking
Frankie out. The guy's a bum. But...

1009
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,640
you know, grass is grass.

1010
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,180
No, it's not. You don't have dead grass.
Michael doesn't have dead grass.

1011
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,460
- No.
- Happy people don't.

1012
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,760
And I never saw it until Jenny
came over and she was so happy.

1013
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,540
I saw the dead grass for the first time.

1014
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:41,080
I'll be right back.
I just have to change my order.

1015
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,520
She wouldn't have dead grass
any more than you would, Dad.

1016
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,120
She doesn't settle for less either.

1017
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,620
I don't know where to seat anyone.

1018
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,420
We're having twice as many
as we planned on having.

1019
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:02,520
I know. Does it really matter? Isn't everyone
just gonna be moving around anyway?

1020
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,080
Yeah.

1021
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,680
It's my father's birthday today.

1022
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1023
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,640
They're throwing a party for him
at my parents' house.

1024
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,960
- I'm gonna take a break, okay?
- Sure.

1025
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,340
He should know. I should tell him.

1026
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,300
Michael should tell him.
He's the one doing it.

1027
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,820
I don't wanna put... I don't wanna put...

1028
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,960
What are you guys talking about?

1029
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,920
Nothing.

1030
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,540
Are you sure?

1031
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,360
Yeah. No, I'll tell him.

1032
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,840
Hey, listen, Dad...

1033
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,640
Jenny asked me to walk her down the aisle.

1034
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,880
And I said yes.

1035
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,260
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

1036
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,280
I saw Rose leave for the wedding.
She looked pretty.

1037
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,880
That is not a real wedding.

1038
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,880
Okay. I saw them leave
for the fake wedding.

1039
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,340
No sign of Eddie.

1040
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,640
Well, at least he's got
his head screwed on right.

1041
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,520
Honey.

1042
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,120
We were there the night Jenny was born.

1043
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,560
We'd always thought
that we'd be at her wedding.

1044
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,960
What makes you think two women
getting dressed up in wedding gowns

1045
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:23,600
and prancing down some hotel aisle
is the same as getting married?

1046
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,080
Jenny does.

1047
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,840
What?

1048
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,040
Jenny makes me think it.

1049
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,220
- What are you doing here?
- I saw you drive up and...

1050
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,680
door was unlocked so...

1051
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,800
Look...

1052
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,280
Maybe Ellen deserved it. I mean,
we both know how she can get.

1053
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,700
But you know, Rose said
some bad things to her and...

1054
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,040
when something really bothers me...

1055
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,240
I'm like you. You know, I... I dig in.

1056
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,040
We've known each other a long time and...

1057
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,800
if I don't dig myself out...

1058
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,240
I lose.

1059
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,720
And that's why I'm here.
To dig myself out.

1060
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,880
How do you do that?

1061
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,780
I don't know. I never had to do it before.

1062
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,900
I guess I start with me, I mean...

1063
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,120
and that's why I'm here.

1064
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,400
To dig myself out of me.

1065
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,140
Are you sure that this isn't too much?
This dress isn't too much?

1066
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,600
- It's a beautiful dress.
- Okay.

1067
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,960
Eddie!

1068
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,960
I don't know if you want me here, but...

1069
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,180
I decided to come.

1070
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,960
- Why wouldn't I want you here?
- Well, I...

1071
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,740
I turned my back on you.

1072
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,720
Oh, Dad, I...

1073
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,620
I know how hard it is for you
to accept who I am, and...

1074
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,440
I lied for so long, and then, I said those
horrible things and I made you angry.

1075
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,420
No, no, no.
This has nothing to do with it. I...

1076
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,720
I wasn't angry. I...

1077
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,640
I walked away because...

1078
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,400
Because I was hurt.

1079
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,100
You said you wanted me out of your life
and you'd be relieved when I was gone.

1080
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,960
You said... you said you...

1081
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,360
you wouldn't miss me.

1082
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,660
Me.

1083
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,760
You wouldn't miss me.

1084
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,280
I'm your dad.

1085
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,660
Nobody has ever loved you
more than me, and nobody ever will.

1086
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,200
How could you not miss me?

1087
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,060
You see...

1088
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,780
when...

1089
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,760
when people hurt me, I...

1090
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,000
I don't talk about it. I...

1091
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,080
I walk away.

1092
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,440
I always walk away.

1093
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,400
But...

1094
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,920
I can't walk away from you.

1095
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,460
So...

1096
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,960
if that's okay...

1097
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,720
You're my daughter.

1098
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,480
And I would like to walk you
down the aisle.

1099
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,240
Living in a moment I would die for.

1100
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,760
These words best describe every minute
of everyday of the last 5 years.

1101
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,620
That's why I'm standing in front
of our family and our friends...

1102
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,080
but most importantly, in front of you...

1103
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,300
and in the presence of God to vow...

1104
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,900
to be your faithfully committed...

1105
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,200
lifetime companion.

1106
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,720
Do you know what I mean
about the grass, Aaron?

1107
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,960
Yes, I do.

1108
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,500
When I move away and sell that house...

1109
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,500
that grass will die and I know it will.

1110
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,520
But my grass...

1111
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,300
the grass that is inside of me
will always be green.

1112
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,560
- Do you know what I mean?
- I do.

1113
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,060
- Are you a lesbian?
- No.

1114
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,960
Good.

1115
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:25,760
That's mine.

1116
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,660
Okay, everybody. This is it.
It's time for the conga line.

1117
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,600
Oh, my God! I love the conga line!
