A film by Peter Calin Netzer

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,833
Based on a real story

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:45,233
My mournful... eyes...
with longing... cry...

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:58,990
And up... to heavens... they aspire.

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:10,431
My thoughts... among the stars...
ﬂy high...

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,316
Ma, look, my brother!

10
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,038
It's a rabbit, not your bro !

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,909
Then why the lady on the 1st
ﬂoor sais we breed like rabbits?

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,834
Nicolae, ask something nice
for a change. Or better shut up!

13
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,112
How can I ask anything
if I shut up?

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,550
Mother! Let's go!

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,910
1, 2, 3, 4...
Ma, what comes after 4?

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,316
- Prick!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, prick, 6...

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,596
I told you to speak nice.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,356
Ma, take me in your arms!
I'm tired!

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,154
| mustn't cany anything.
Give me you hand.

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,995
No! I want in your arms.
l'll kiss you...

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,833
| promisse you to speak nice.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,276
- I wanted to show you I can count.
- Be quiet for Pete's sake!

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,473
Kids!

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,270
- The baby's coming!
- Mother!

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,192
Kids, the baby's coming!

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,319
- Come on, Costin!
- Kids, it's the 7th, the7th...

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,633
- Who's gonna carry me?
- Walk, sucker, you got feet.

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,836
I can't. They're too short.

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,792
Dad can bring me another.
He's the king of baloons !

30
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,832
This is good for Nicolae.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,389
Listen!

32
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,708
There's bad news and good news.

33
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,714
The bad news is that
the factory will be closed.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,632
You'll have to leave the premises.
The new security service is here.

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,195
And the pay due?

36
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,351
The new owner, Mr. American,
doesn't recognize any debt.

37
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,312
He promised after he'd refurbished
the factory and got things going,

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,948
he'd hire back some of us.

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,835
Some? And the others?

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,709
The good news is
he says it's OK

41
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,910
if instead of the owing pay you take
two boxes of balloons each.

42
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,118
- Again balloons?
- Balloons? Not again!

43
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,078
- Five kilos per person.
- I don't need any.

44
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,631
- And sell them? You buy?
- Go to a fair!

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,475
Our houses are awash
with balloons.

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,630
Folks, take your boxes
and leave the bay.

47
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,997
- Severance pay, not balloons!
- Quiet!

48
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,035
Take the boxes and leave peacefully.

49
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,477
- Come on, it's not the first time!
- Help me, Mala!

50
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,870
Be brave, what the heck!

51
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,509
Push some more!

52
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Now! Come, Maria.

53
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,958
Breathe deeply!

54
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,273
You're almost there.

55
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,991
That's good!

56
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,634
Now, push hard, Maria!

57
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,432
One more time! Take a deep
breath!

58
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,351
Come on, Maria!

59
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,356
It's a boy, Maria! Bless him!

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,275
Long live May Day!

61
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,238
Long live May Day!

62
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:32,035
"Who built the pub in my way
knew that's where I'd stay..."

63
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,358
Don't be sad, man. The American
put us out of our misery.

64
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,758
Should build him a statue.
Now we can start our own business.

65
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,036
I've got a thousand ideas!

66
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,276
For instance,
we chop old car tires

67
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,834
and sell the product
to sports tracks, to tennis courts...

68
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,432
Cut the crap!

69
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,230
Fuck the sport tracks!

70
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,909
Listen to this!
And here we don't need any car.

71
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,590
The sister of my step father's
aunt, not this one, the other...

72
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,548
However, she sells Quick Slim.
50% commission. Sounds great!

73
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,950
She's looking for sales agents.

74
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,112
What do you say?

75
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,878
You're right, it's bullshit.

76
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,033
If you don't eat
you don't need slimming products.

77
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,833
Gee, I guess folks'd kick us out!

78
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,672
Shut yourtrap!

79
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,311
Kill me, but I have to tell you this.
Man, this is really a great idea.

80
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,599
Wait! Look at those:
they make 30 bucks a day.

81
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,912
At least 10 they surely make.
Every day.

82
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,078
And they do nothing.

83
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,915
Just take off their knickers,
if they wear any.

84
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,792
The man is bonkers!

85
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,876
| see things in a ﬂash
and | get so many original ideas!

86
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,198
I wasn't thinking of humping
the drivers. Yach!

87
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,874
But humping the....
Wait, man!

88
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,480
Wait, you idiot! I was thinking
of humping the lady drivers.

89
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,996
I saw many women driving trucks,
I tell you.

90
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,789
Long trips and a body has its
needs.

91
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,952
Danish, Swedish, German ladies,
modern women.

92
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,113
Only our cows here think
it's a job just for men.

93
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,157
Buzz off!

94
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,076
Look!

95
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,277
Look at her!

96
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,236
This one's a dyke.

97
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,118
Never mind.
The next will be straight.

98
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,278
He's a tramp but I really love him.

99
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,594
Man, you smell of perfume,
oh, my.

100
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,280
I know you've been
with another woman, don't lie.

101
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,958
Thank you, Mala!

102
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,670
- I owe you!
- Don't mention it!

103
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,596
Better enjoy your
beautiful new boy!

104
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,957
- Where could Ion be?
- loana, go and look for your father.

105
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,676
Hey, where are you going?

106
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,396
If Ion invites people over
I have to treat them, right?

107
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,028
I've brought some salami
and pressed cheese.

108
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,509
Nicolae wolfed that down.

109
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,994
Everything here is ours!

110
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,879
Ours, man, ours!

111
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,910
Ours, ours, ours!

112
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,990
This is mine. Scam!

113
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,071
Father!

114
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,232
Father, come home!
Ma's had a little baby.

115
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,119
You have one more son.

116
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,429
We won't leave until they
take us back. Class struggle!

117
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,150
The police, man! The police!

118
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,311
You cowards, everything is ours!

119
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,438
Father, come down!
They'll get you! I beg you!

120
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,831
Don't ﬂee! Chicken hearts!
Everything is ours!

121
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,474
She's a German!
Her name is Gertrude.

122
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,430
She's like the back of a bus, you
don't know if she's a man or a woman,

123
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,716
but has a great heart.

124
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,195
She coughed the money.

125
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,511
ldidn't even hump her. All she
needed was a little tenderness.

126
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,114
We only sang in bed.

127
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,355
Look what she gave me:
ten video cassettes.

128
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,350
Learn to play golf... She used to be
doorkeeper at a golf club.

129
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,153
Pa, pa!

130
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,591
That's the fresh one?

131
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,235
I'm out of here. He'll be out in four
days, don't worry. I spoke to the chief.

132
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,268
His sister-in-law works with
my wife at the milk factory.

133
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,713
Look, father, what a beautiful boy!

134
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,753
We think of giving him your name:
Ion Junior.

135
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,230
Can I be Junior too?

136
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,349
Take this for the baby!

137
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,592
It's the proper thing!

138
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,309
Don't leave!
Why does he keep quiet?

139
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,028
Something fell on his head. He
had a concussion. He'll be OK.

140
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,918
Stay calm.

141
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,638
Put ice on it.

142
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
Mala found work for me at the
laundry.

143
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,835
She'll find something for you too.

144
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,198
He was Best worker in the factory.
The State should give him a job.

145
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,148
- What state?
- And who'll take care of the kids?

146
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,639


147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,270
Why isn't he shaven?
Don't they have a barber here?

148
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,194
- He's got measles.
- Only kids get measles.

149
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,998
- As a rule. But adults can get it too.
- Up to what age?

150
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,154
You stupid! You visit once your
father an you ask only bullshit.

151
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,278
- Ask something clever!
- The visit's over.

152
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,593
- We just got here...
- It's the rules. Come on!

153
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,154
Take care! Don't talk politics
or they may punish you!

154
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,753
Come on, Ion!

155
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,876
This is not the boulevard!
I know you!

156
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,750
Since you were 16 and you made
sheep eyes to everybody.

157
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,040
This is the place where you work,
woman! Say after me!

158
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,558
-  | work.
- 80 work and stop wiggling your ass!

159
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,430
He can't get enough, the animal!

160
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,717
Gina! Stop chatting and get to
work.

161
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,077
This is not a home for the elderly.

162
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,029
You! Come with me to my ofﬁce.

163
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,876
Come in.

164
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,872
Shut the door.

165
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,156
Close that door.

166
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,631
Come over here.

167
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,318
Look, girl. I'm not at all satisfied
with your work here.

168
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,629
You move slowly,
you bump into people,

169
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,636
op the laundry, waste water...

170
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,275
Take off that robe,
let it dry a little!

171
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,075
Take it off and let it dry.

172
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,074
- But I have nothing under it!
- Don't you have a smart bra, panties?

173
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,593
- I do.
- Take everything off or you walk!

174
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,719
Wait! Where you going?
Don't leave.

175
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,038
I'm in love with you.
I'll pay you double.

176
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,437
My wife doesn't give it to me
anymore.

177
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,319
- You idiot!
- It's just a dick like any other.

178
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,119
I want it to get some action,
see?

179
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,431
You're the dick! Scumbag!
Let me go!

180
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,588
The same old story
until you drop your panties.

181
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,958
Think! I'll make a lady out of you,
give you money.

182
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,476
Moraru, Stanescu, Dumitrache,
Enescu...

183
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,830
Camataru...

184
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,073
- Moraru, Stanescu...
- What's up?

185
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,633
He keeps saying these names.
Then stops and mumbles...

186
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,113
You called the doctor
who treated him in jail?

187
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,033
He said it was the blow
but it'd pass.

188
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,749
- When?
- I don't know. We called uncle Milco.

189
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,719
Vaiscovici...

190
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,633
Leave him be.
It happens after such blows.

191
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,318
Camataru...

192
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,233
Please, give me another balloon.

193
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,199
- How was work?
- I quit.

194
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,475
What?

195
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,473
I'll tell you.
Not in front of the kids.

196
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,433
Hello!

197
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,878
What is it ?

198
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,911
How is he? Bad?

199
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,589
- He's gone off his rocker.
- Off his rocker?

200
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,354
- Yes.
- What's the matter, old sport?

201
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,317
Tell me, Ion!

202
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,790
- The time is up.
- What time?

203
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,919
- What time, old sport?
- The bike, the pig, the bike...

204
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,275
The pig?

205
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,714
Time is up, man.

206
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,152
- I got it!
- What?

207
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,355
Doc's told me memory
comes back to you

208
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,878
if triggered by something.
But when?

209
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,196
But what about the names
he says?

210
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,432
At 16 he entered a contest
on football matters.

211
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,318
He got to the final.

212
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,677
Exactly!
The prize was a pig and a bike.

213
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,719
In the ﬁnal question about Dinamo's
1976 players he missed one name.

214
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,316
- And also the prize.
- That's what it is!

215
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,478
And now he's gonna repeat
those names all the time?

216
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,599
I'll tell him the name he missed
and he'll be all right again.

217
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,790
Talnar!

218
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,551
Talnar!

219
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,837
- What if it was not Talnar?
- It was the famous forward, man!

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,070
When they played against...

221
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,557
Talnar!

222
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,119
- What do we do?
- There's another popular method.

223
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,950
My grandpa lost his memory
when a horse kicked him.

224
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,797
Grandma Milco reckoned that
if a kick addled his wits

225
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,630
then another kick'd set him right.
Want me to kick him?

226
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,233
Sock him!

227
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,313
Step aside.

228
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,158
Stand back!

229
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,392
Why you hit me? Why, man?

230
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,677
Stop it, Ion! Stop it! It's alright.

231
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,075
It's all right, man, all right...

232
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,713
It's all right, boy.

233
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,509
Nothing, man.
Let's grab some chow.

234
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,192
Bless your heart, God.

235
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,920
- Screw your Talnar, man!
- Dinner's ready! Come!

236
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,039
- Thanks. I already ate.
- I had something in prison.

237
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,952
Let the kids eat.

238
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,999
- Give us something to drink.
- l have my drink here.

239
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,799
- Give me mine.
- There's nothing to drink.

240
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,555
You should quit this drinking!
It makes them all suffer.

241
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,474
- Just put a period to it!
- I know how to put a period.

242
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,834
Like this!

243
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,788
OK, but now we deserve a toast
for the new boy, right?

244
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,838
What are you doing?
The kids are watching.

245
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,158
- How about the reserves?
- Nothing there.

246
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,117
No reserves?

247
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,557
And what's this?

248
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,758
- Let's go to the pub, man.
- Ion, please no. Don't go, Ion.

249
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,037
Ion, stay with us a little.

250
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,069
To your health and happiness.

251
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,230
- Stay with us, Ion, just a little...
- Milco!

252
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,598
- Daddy!
- I'll bring him home in half an hour.

253
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,831
Wait, Ion!

254
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,436
At least promise them
you'll be back in half an hour.

255
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,630
- Pa!
- Father never knocks at the door.

256
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,672
See who's there.

257
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,956
Joker! I'm better than you.

258
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,278
Mrs. Maria is home?
Take these.

259
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,876
- Who is it?
- I think it's for you.

260
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,069
I came to apologize.
| behaved like a pig.

261
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,554
Please let me finish.
Come here for a second!

262
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,757
I don't want to kids to hearthis.

263
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,434
- Allow me to behave decently...
- What do you want?

264
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,149
Understand me, I pay for it,
whatever...

265
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,835
When the kids are asleep...
I have the money ready.

266
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,753
Go to hell, old stud!
Those whores are't enough?

267
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,755
I call the Police!
I'll have you eat those ﬂowers!

268
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,119
- Buzz off, old hag!
- Fatso! Old fart!

269
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,953
- Ion isn't back?
- No!

270
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,398
- I'm going after him.
- Go home, you're sick. I'll go.

271
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,108
Who?

272
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,598
Three nines.

273
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,118
Eight tits, four ladies, Ion!

274
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,828
- Ion, come on home!
- Let's play another!

275
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,436
- No. First let me see your money.
- I'll pay when we ﬁnish.

276
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,433
Listen to him!
Give us your wife!

277
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,273
You haven't even see your baby!

278
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,757
- Ion, come home!
- Ionica, go home! Mammy's calling.

279
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,912
Let's play another.

280
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,151
You don't believe me? Who was your
foreman in the foundry?

281
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,151
Who taught you tricks?

282
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,270
Who protected you?
Now you ckeckin' on me?

283
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,993
You joined these mobsters
and you think...

284
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,236
That's water under the bridge!

285
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,755
Now you either have the money
or you don't.

286
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,514
Ion, there're guys coming
to your house at night

287
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,036
to screw your wife for money,
in front of the kids!

288
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,796
Perhaps you'd like me to bring
the money so you waste it?

289
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,829
It's for you that I gamble!
For us to get out of this shit.

290
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,833
If you don't have the money,
it's OK.

291
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,594
You give us your wife!

292
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,999
Fuck you!

293
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,597
If you hit on her I'll kill you!
If you pick on her! kill you!

294
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,998
Another one?

295
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,552
You coming?

296
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,750
- Where you going, woman?
- Why do you cry?

297
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,356
-Put your name on the list of hussies.
- There's still room.

298
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,118
Fuck you!

299
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,272
Milco!

300
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,312
Milco!

301
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,599
You asleep?

302
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,113
- Wake up! Give me some dough.
- I don't have any.

303
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,359
- Please!
- I don't have any.

304
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,308
Fuck you and yourfamily.
Where's the child benefit?

305
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,235
- Give me from the reserve, hear?
- The reserve's for bread.

306
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,470
Give me the money!

307
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,359
Give me the money!
l'll win and put it back.

308
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,394
Pa, leave her alone!

309
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,797
Give it to me!

310
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,549
Give me the money or I'll kill you!

311
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,234
Stop it, asshole!

312
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,158
Not in the head!!

313
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,874
I'll kill you all!

314
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,755
No, Ion!

315
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,110
No!

316
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,469
- What's the matter?
- She broke my bones...

317
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,354
- Who did?
- The Dutch woman!

318
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,550
- Got any money?
- This is not a woman.

319
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,869
150 kilos on top of me...
I'm just not cut out for this.

320
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,071
For 50 dollars...

321
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,790
- Give me the money, Ion!
- I'll give it back to you.

322
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,076
Ion, give me the money!

323
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,874
This money is the hardest
ever won in my life.

324
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,759
- Open up or I'll bust your place!
- I could be left an inﬁrm.

325
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,673
A handicapped man.
Ion, my man!

326
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,912
Where're you going, dummy?
You're out on parole.

327
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,152
I got the money!

328
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,590
I got the money! Deal the cards!

329
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,710
What are you staring at?
Deal the cards.

330
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,032
Ion, my good boy...

331
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,800
- Cut the cards.
- It's alright!

332
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,916
- One.
- One...

333
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,191
- Two.
- Two...

334
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,756
- Three.
- Three...

335
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,359
- Five.
- And five...

336
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,478
- How many you need?
- None.

337
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,391
- Me neither. What have you got?
- Eight tits. Four ladies.

338
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,915
- That's all? Nothing more?
- Four queens, Pentagon.

339
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,478
Four aces, my Ion !

340
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,950
- Give me the cards!
- Give it to him!

341
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,999
Give me the cards!
You bandit, show the cards.

342
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,837
Cough up the money or! bust
you up!

343
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,913
Hello! Police? You hear me?

344
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,560
Mr. Milco! Sir!

345
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,788
- Good evening!
- Good evening.

346
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,516
Brunhilda, my friend recommended
you.

347
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,994
Are you free noW?

348
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,116
Are you working?

349
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,716
Wait, wait.

350
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,868
Wait a minute!
How about Ion?

351
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,917
- He's with the little ones.
- Really? Or he is not home?

352
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,234
- We go?
- Yes.

353
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,915
I'll do all the talking
at the town hall.

354
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,558
I have a good story.
I know what to tell them.

355
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,199
Come quicker.

356
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,279
God, you are a mess!
What did he do to you?

357
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,637
- Made the 8th baby in the corridor.
- Shut up, stupid.

358
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,236
We ﬁnish here and we go straight
to the Police.

359
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,310
Dont' worry. We'll manage.
We'll see better times.

360
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,115
- Wait!
- What now?

361
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,079
Come on!

362
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,874
Liars! Every day...

363
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Let me be, don't you hear!

364
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,994
The Mayor's waiting for me!
I'm with the kids, don't you see?

365
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,869
The little guy with the balloon!
Take a close-up of him!

366
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,951
Don't ﬁlm him for he's sick!

367
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,955
Thieves!

368
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,552
Mr. Mayor, we'll set ourselves
on ﬁre,

369
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,037
if you don't give us a house!

370
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,678
- Close up on him!
- Where should we live?

371
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,948
You'll see what we'll do...

372
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,676
Up, the mayor...

373
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,355
Murderers!

374
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,797
You'll see! Criminals!

375
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,114
That's it! Set yourself on fire!
Courage!

376
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,309
Dear viewers these are
shuddering shots.

377
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,512
Come here!

378
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,799
This is the result of poverty,

379
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
of the need to have a roof
over one's head!

380
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,558
Take them home, aunt Mala!
I won't be long!

381
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,109
You go straight to the Police!

382
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,598
I'll come as soon as I can. Must teach
him a lesson. Come, kids!

383
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,751
Ofﬁcer, she didn't want to come
but this time he overdid it.

384
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,872
Hey, you're breaking my legs!

385
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,948
Excuse me.

386
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,835
Shut the fuck up!
I'll see you in the morning.

387
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,871
Same old story. They hang around
at junctures, in truck parks,

388
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,952
and when you call them tramps
they feel offended.

389
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,031
What's the matter, lady?

390
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,271
Speak, Maria!

391
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,831
- He hasn't always been like this.
- He lost his job three times.

392
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,629
- Now he even rapes her!
- Rapes her? Isn't she his legal wife?

393
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,231
I'm at my wits' end!

394
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,836
I've 7 kids at home and no money.

395
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,034
He keeps bad company, gambles,
loses everything,

396
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,077
and comes home drunk.

397
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,277
If you want a medical certificate
you have to sue him,

398
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,830
and that may take years.
I wouldn't advise you.

399
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,913
Money spent, lawyers...
Still there's one way!

400
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,118
- What?
- I don't understand!

401
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,152
We must catch him in the act.

402
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,232
Wait till he comes home
and then call us.

403
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,119
This lady could inform us
and we'd come quick.

404
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,352
This way we'd have proof
he raped you.

405
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,954
Technically it's called trapping.

406
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,831
You mean he rapes her again?

407
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,678
Lady, wait!
You must make the statement.

408
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,355
Maria, don't run away like this!

409
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,198
The medicines!
Take care, they're heavy!

410
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,554
There...

411
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,193
Maria, I know it's hard for you.

412
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,598
But here, many unfortunate people
found a roof.

413
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,235
My child,
God is always testing us.

414
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,915
Only by faith we can save
our souls.

415
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,355
Jesus suffered for us.

416
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,992
You, Maria, must suffer
for your kids.

417
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,516
I have no strength left, father.

418
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,877
Good day, father! We're from
Direct TV and we'd like to film...

419
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,157
- We need no advertising.
- Aid from France...

420
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,470
- Please, don't ﬁlm that.
- Why not, sister?

421
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,234
Our benefactor doesn't want it.
Please, go away!

422
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,469
It's news...

423
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,393
We have nothing to say without
the approval of the Patriarchate.

424
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,233
- Wait, sister...
- Please go away!

425
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,709
Why are you so adamant?
It's just a piece of news...

426
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,233
- Thank you, father.
- God help us!

427
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,156
- Have you got the French guy?
- Yes, yes!

428
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,988
Come! Come!

429
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,715
Presents!

430
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,877
They arrested Ion! Go to the Police
and see what you do.

431
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,593
Mr. Ofﬁcer!
Please help me.

432
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,115
He does foolish things only
when he's drunk. Please let him go!

433
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,396
Now he rapes you,
now he's a good man!

434
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,710
You mock the Romanian Police,
woman?

435
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,716
Who will pay the damages?
He trashed the pub.

436
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,752
I want him out of my sight
for some time. Tell him to leave town.

437
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,475
That's all I can do for him.
Is that clear?

438
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,750
Me, to vanish?

439
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,436
I was labor hero!

440
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,030
I nearly smoldered to death
in that blasted foundry.

441
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,515
They promised me a home,

442
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,318
and I accepted to inﬂate
those stupid balloons.

443
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,196
You made them chase me away!

444
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,955
- Me?!
- Yes! You!

445
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:43,719
I had 7 children with you and put up
with your hysteria and drunk sprees.

446
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,192
You made a laughing stock out
of me, you animal!

447
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,919
Me?

448
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,673
I'll go away at my folks
until it's all over.

449
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,029
Pack a few things for me.

450
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,237
You pack them or not?

451
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,432
Do | disturb?

452
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,113
What's up?

453
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,078
I'll go to the countryside.

454
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,839
My wife kicked me out too.
The hookers told on me.

455
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,955
About the Dutch and the German.

456
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,117
Can I come, too?

457
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,238
That's life, at the countryside.
I already have an idea.

458
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,552
It's almost ready. Look!

459
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,596
I'll wait you outside.

460
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,674
- | asked you what's this?
- Coca-Cola empties.

461
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,559
Each bottle can bring us 100 dollars.

462
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,356
Idiot! How could an empty
bring 100 dollars?

463
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,033
- You know what truffles are?
- No.

464
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,078
Special mushrooms that grow
underground

465
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,276
and are very difficult to ﬁnd.

466
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,355
One kilo costs 3000 dollars.
3000 dollars!

467
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,592
Dogs are specially trained to scent
them. That's the only problem.

468
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,479
- Where can I get such dogs?
- I'll kill this guy!

469
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,359
You'll be grateful
to the end of your days.

470
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,159
A guy in my block invented this.

471
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,599
It took him 9 years to ﬁgure out
how to grow them in his basement.

472
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,753
9 years! He nearly went blind
but he did it!

473
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,913
- Did what: go blind?
- Grow the mushrooms, dummy!

474
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,789
And exactly when he made it,
he kicked the bucket.

475
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,518
Wait!

476
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,596
First he told me the secret. Truffles
need a wet, dark, and warm place.

477
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,230
So we paint these bottles black,
we put soil and seeds

478
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,119
and put them in the sun.
That's all!

479
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,430
I haven't seen my folks in 15 years

480
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,958
and now I go home with this stupid
story, and a bag of empties?

481
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,075
Wait, please!

482
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,837
Mrs. Maria! The maintenance
fee is due! At least a part of it.

483
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:24,519
Good thing that trouble-making
husband of yours left!

484
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,352
I understand you, but you're in
debt

485
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,272
What can I tell you?

486
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,590
We live in the basement.
Not in a ﬂat!

487
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,790
I can't pay. You can kick us out.
I really can't.

488
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,675
- Lady!
- Throw her out!

489
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,274
Serves me right to treat
you decently.

490
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:48,956
- Out with her!
- I want the money by tomorrow.

491
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,393
- Got it? If you don't pay, you're out!
- That's it!

492
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,834
That's final!

493
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,592
Mr. Petrica!

494
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,318
Leave the woman alone, she's
got enough troubles as it is.

495
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,234
You can't live without the money
on that basement?

496
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,990
How about the Gypsies on the
2nd ﬂoor?

497
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,879
You're afraid to ask them but
not her?

498
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,759
We are Roma, not Gypsies, old
bag!

499
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,956
Have something against
our community?

500
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,037
You take her side when mantenance
costs an eye and a leg.

501
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:19,996
Jesus!

502
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,677
To the pasha comes an Arab
Bony, small-eyed and quite drab...

503
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,751
- My pasha, I'm just a bedouin...
- Who is this gentleman?

504
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,518
My work mate.

505
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,114
Pa's gone daffy,
and ma eats like a horse.

506
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,470
Shut up!
Aren't you ashamed?

507
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,192
I'm glad you've come.
I'll make you something to eat.

508
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,636
He's senile. Swallows everything
he ﬁnds at the stall round the corner.

509
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,633
Coca-Cola, chewing gum,
Marlboro, candies...

510
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,758
Even the surprises in the chewing
gum packs.

511
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,592
And then he gets constipated.

512
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,512
God forbidden!

513
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,720
- How much land you have?
- Land?

514
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,714
- All things fair, it should be mine!
- Shut the hell up.

515
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,038
- I don't need your land.
- No, man, we just came to breathe.

516
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,679
- Breathe?
- Sure!

517
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,631
There's so many like you city
boys coming to catch their breath...

518
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,908
Instead they wolf down ourfood
like they had belly worms!

519
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,550
- What?
- We have a fabulous business idea.

520
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,908
All we need is some Coke empties.
What? OK.

521
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,599
We need nothing.
Just catch our breath.

522
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,590
Maria! Maria!

523
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,874
Look, you recognize
our benefactor from France?

524
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,038
I told him about you
and the children.

525
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,031
I think he'll...

526
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,789
I told him about the baby.
He'd like to help.

527
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,398
I don't understand.

528
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,831
My child,

529
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:24,271
you can't manage, so the gentleman
wants to raise the baby for you.

530
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,269
- The little one.
- HoW's that?

531
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,349
First he'll take him to the doctor
to see if he's healthy and then...

532
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,113
He wants to help, to buy your
baby.

533
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,112
- Buy my baby?
- Adopt him! Take him to France.

534
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,719
It's for your own good
and the child's.

535
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,830
He'll lead a life you've never
dreamed of.

536
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:02,311
The man'll give you enough money
to get out of your misery.

537
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,116
You can buy a house, a ﬂat.

538
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,148
I won't give my kids to nobody.

539
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,396
I picked 'em in the trash cans
near pubs!

540
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,360
This man is crazy or what?
What does he want with the empties?

541
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,272
Let me sleep!

542
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,438
He said something about spores.
What's that?

543
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,597
- I don't care, man.
- I went to the notary.

544
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,233
This is the paper he drew up.
All you have to do is to sign it!

545
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,555
- A statement?
- You give up the land in my favour.

546
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:18,074
- I told you I want nothing.
- You're my brother...

547
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,518
But what if your kids have claims?

548
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,797
Please sign.

549
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,675
Not there! At the bottom!

550
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,757
The second page too.

551
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,918
That's it.

552
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,199
I give you 300 dollars.
It's all I got.

553
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,435
I'll leave it on the table.

554
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,839
- Do you enjoy it?
- Yes.

555
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,951
What happened? Where's Mala?

556
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,831
Did you call her?

557
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,115
I think she kind of paralyzed.

558
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,957
Her eyes are open
but she doesn't budge.

559
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,435
Oh, goodness!

560
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,196
Where do you go, my sweet one?!

561
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,398
Oh, Lord! My Milica!

562
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,430
You're gone and left us...

563
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,957
They're late again.

564
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,271
May she rest in peace!

565
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,353
This time she paid maintenance
for you.

566
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,435
From now on I won't put up with
you.

567
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,792
God rest her.

568
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,597
Wait! I'm coming.

569
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,353
Pussy!

570
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,796
This dress is from your grandma?

571
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,718
You're new? Saw you someplace.

572
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,956
Slack business today.
It's too hot and they grow limp.

573
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,511
Stop giving her tips!
New lays don't start here.

574
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,429
She go into the bushes first,
prick her ass for starters.

575
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,558
Come girl, remember your ﬁrst
time!

576
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,956
I don't. I remember they called
you "Nickie scares the prickie".

577
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,316
Say that one more time and
I'll knock you out for a season.

578
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,351
Cool it, girls!

579
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,671
The cops!

580
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,637
The cops!

581
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,472
Nice but it's crazy

582
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,597
to spend all the money you brother
gave you on a night at the hotel.

583
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,828
And then what?
We could invest it in an ostrich.

584
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,110
You can capitalize on every
little part of an ostrich.

585
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,998
I couldn't care less.

586
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,558
At least I have something
to remember.

587
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,553
Something cool in this shitty life.

588
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,390
Where's this stuff from?
The church or the Red Cross?

589
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,028
- We get something to wear too?
- You will!

590
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,239
- Shoes, perhaps...
- I want a pair of hob-nailed boots.

591
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,039
I want T-shirts.
| always come to wear loana's.

592
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,112
- And I want...how do you call it?
- Balloons?

593
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,677
You have 250
to inﬂate until you're old.

594
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,673
Not balloons! A TV set.

595
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,359
- No more no less than a TV.
- We'll get one.

596
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,397
And many balloons!

597
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,239
- l two child have.
- l have seven.

598
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,235
Not understand. What seven?

599
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,312
Seven children.

600
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,311
Child, child, child, child,
child, child, child!

601
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,876
| ashamed. Child seven!

602
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,472
l father! I help you.

603
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,394
You problem.

604
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,437
Me wife no more.

605
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,316
Allah want so.

606
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,276
Why do you kick me,
son of a bitch?

607
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,311
- What did you say?
- Your mother's a bitch!

608
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,630
- Say that again!
- Your mother's a whore!

609
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,552
Yours!

610
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,199
Fuck you!

611
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,995
I guess we should hang
a red lamp at the door.

612
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,196
This is not good!

613
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,479
Your mother in a whore!

614
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,757
Your mother is a whore!

615
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,948
Is it true, mother?
It is true?

616
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,317
Told you times and again
not to play with them!

617
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:04,549
What could he do?
Stay here and watch your doings?

618
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,750
That's what he should do ?

619
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,872
Mala!

620
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,791
Mala!

621
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,352
Open up please.

622
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,077
Mala!

623
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,149
Let my Mona dance

624
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,877
and my godmother prance...

625
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,275
What's the matter with you, Maria?

626
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,392
Come on here.

627
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,719
Hey!

628
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,158
What's wrong with her?

629
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,197
- I don't know. You manage?
- We'll see.

630
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,274
Dana! Come here!

631
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,114
I'm a good woman
until you piss me off.

632
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,751
You either work with us or you
go where the fucking wants you to.

633
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,828
You're picky? If he tells you
to go with him, you go!

634
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,349
Don't think you're better
than us all!

635
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,031
You stay home with your stupid
kids! Who made you have them?

636
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,149
Well, looks we're gonna have
fun!

637
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,193
Girls!

638
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,440
- Hi!
- Move your ass, they don't see me.

639
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,950
We are from Direct TV
and we'd like to ﬁlm your story.

640
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,549
Many think brothels
should be established.

641
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,756
Yes, that'd be ﬁne! Quiet!

642
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,831
When the law is amended.

643
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,156
It's humiliating for you
to work in the street.

644
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,993
-And to risk so much!
- Yes, it's kind of humiliating...

645
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,675
We'd like you to make a live
broadcast as a humanitarian plea.

646
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,718
- What's that "humanitarian"?
- Shut up! You say "humanitarian"?

647
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,639
But when that man set himself
on ﬁre and nobody stepped in?

648
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,071
- That was humanitarian too?
- Come on, girls!

649
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,509
We may go and make a movie to
watch at night, so you can jerk off.

650
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,238
Wait!

651
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,877
The man on fire once
had a flat and sold it,

652
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,270
and now he wanted another
for free! Honest!

653
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,316
I piss on your honesty!
That man's dead. That's the truth!

654
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,311
Turkish!

655
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,350
Turkish truck there.

656
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,429
Many colored balloons in Turkey.

657
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,311
Ma... Maria! Guzel!

658
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,916
Thanks, but we don't need them!
Everybody to bed!

659
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,237
What are you doing here?
Please go!

660
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,238
Not trouble you!
Girl in parking give me address.

661
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,076
Not want you mad!

662
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,910
Not here! Take me someplace!

663
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,557
Why did you come?

664
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,834
I think much about you.
I want come with you.

665
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,234
I want...

666
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,230
 you come with me.

667
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,273
Let it be...

668
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,188
- Who's this?
- The one who busted my balls!

669
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:15,360
Stop jerking off! It's fattening!
Come here for a fuck!

670
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,830
Stop jerking off! It's fattening!
Come here for a fuck!

671
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,113
You'd better ask us nice
and we come gladly.

672
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,872
Come here, fat mouth!

673
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,397
I'm used to ﬁne cars, man!
Didn't you see the cars | cruise in?

674
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,350
When you want to scratch your
balls, you come to us too.

675
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,789
- Move your ass!
- Dont' push me, animal!

676
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,154
Watch it!

677
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,871
Mother fucker!

678
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,034
Don't worry! They just take us
to the station for a night, to look busy.

679
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,953
Moraru, Camataru,
Georgescu, Vaiscovici...

680
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,428
Fatso wants us
to have a drink with her.

681
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,471
- Mr. Commander...
- "Statement" or "Mr. Commander"?

682
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,108
She knows, she has three years
of school.

683
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,749
- The undersigned...
- With a "s' or a "z"?

684
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,753
- As you hear it, stupid!
- With an "s", from "suck"!

685
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,319
Nickie scares the prickie...

686
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,311
Hey, you over there!

687
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,473
Aren't you the one with the rape?
By your husband, right?

688
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:23,076
- Seems it set you going.
- Talk decently, man!

689
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:26,198
- Why pressure the poor woman?
- You sausage!

690
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:31,718
- Talk decently to us, ladies!
- Yeah! I know your kind!

691
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,673
You gave me money?

692
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,233
Here he comes!

693
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,632
We've met.

694
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,832
Come with me.

695
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,794
Come!

696
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:05,072
You 'ave something against her?
Leave her. It's her ﬁrst time.

697
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,709
See you in the morning!

698
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,193
Pay the ﬁne, it can't be helped.

699
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,149
Shut yourtrap
or you stay here longer.

700
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,152
Chief! Why you take her there?
Is it bad?

701
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,910
We come to you live
from a police station

702
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,150
where a young woman
arrested for soliciting

703
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,993
has decided to tell her story.

704
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,791
Maria, we are listening to you!

705
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,477
How old is your eldest daughter?

706
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,077
- 16!
- She goes to school?

707
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,868
Not since the 6th grade.

708
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,756
What does she think
about your doings?

709
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,957
She doesn't have the guts
to tell me.

710
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,834
Allow us to ﬁlm in your house

711
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:10,751
so that the viewers understand
what made you start hustling.

712
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,034
All right.

713
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,994
Thank you.

714
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,871
In about 45 minutes

715
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,637
we'll bring you further details
about this dramatic yet true story.

716
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,151
Stay with Direct TV!

717
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,439
And now what?

718
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,074
We bring pales of water
from the cemetery pump.

719
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,468
Right.

720
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:16,157
Yesterday I went to the doctor.

721
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,156
Gave me a prescription but the
drugs are too expensive for me.

722
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,275
- You have electricity?
- Never had!

723
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,158
You bring clients here?

724
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,032
Sometimes.

725
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,952
How much do you get
for a session?

726
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,793
5-10 dollars.

727
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,754
If we make a calculation,
then in a month you make...

728
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,755
I don't go day and night,
only when l have no money.

729
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,639
I understand.
I want to ask you something.

730
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,150
Why did you choose prostitution?

731
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,717
Dear viewers...

732
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,119
Ion, what are you doing?

733
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,872
- What's the matter?
- You shamed us.

734
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,954
We're the talk of the town!
Everybody saw you on TV.

735
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,557
You'll understand
when you grow up!

736
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,712
- If I come to grow older.
- I do understand.

737
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,712
My respects, Maria! It's me!

738
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,028
I came to give you the big news.
We had a great success.

739
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,230
The film was given twice
on the national TV.

740
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,635
And the mayor decided to give
you a three-room ﬂat.

741
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,837
- We're not interested! Get lost!
- Costin!

742
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,078
You have to go to the TV station.
They're gonna give you a house!

743
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:05,438
They sent the carfor you.
Our crew is waiting. It's a big event.

744
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:12,116
How could I keep a flat? By going
three times more on the street?

745
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,678
You idiot!

746
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,552
They'll give you a job too.
You'll see.

747
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,956
My tearful eyes with longing cry

748
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,199
And up to heavens they aspire

749
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,274
My thoughts among the stars
ﬂy high

750
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,193
While behind them all things
stay dire

751
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,313
| see myself on clouds of ice

752
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,720
Floating and shifting on roads
unknown

753
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,428
Abandoning behind
all that is nice

754
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,796
The children that I've left alone...

755
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,193
From my journey among the stars

756
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,549
I once again return down here

757
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,588
My heart all plagued
with bitter scars

758
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,109
My lovely children to hold near.
