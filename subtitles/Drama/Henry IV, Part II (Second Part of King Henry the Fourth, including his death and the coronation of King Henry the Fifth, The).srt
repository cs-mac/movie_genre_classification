00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,923
How was everything?

00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,301
Real good honey, thanks.

3
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,219
Let me have a pack of
Kools too, would you?

4
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,154
Real nice smile you got there.

5
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,156
Thank you.

6
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,781

Becky.

Hello Otis.

26
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,694
Well, how are you?

27
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,945
Good.

28
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:30,946
It's good to see you.

29
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,531
Good to see you, too.

30
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,700
You got all your things?

31
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,783
Yeah.

32
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,290
You look terrible.

33
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,546
Okay, come on let's go.

34
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,673
It's this way.

35
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,705
Before you got
married I told you

36
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,606
Leroy was no damn good.

37
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,481
That he was trash

38
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,649
and he'd always be trash

39
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,586
and you was going to catch
it and you did didn't you?

40
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,045
I don't really want to
talk about him right now.

41
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,238
Okay by me, we don't
have to talk about it now.

42
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,032
We don't have to
talk about it ever.

43
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,200
How long are you
going to be up here?

44
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,327
It's hard to say.

45
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,286
What about Lurleen?

46
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,597
How long can you
leave her with mama?

47
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,997
I don't know.

48
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,415
I'm going to get a job,

49
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,207
make some money.

50
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,292
Maybe bring her up here,

51
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,585
I don't know.

52
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,544
Where did you tell
Leroy you were going?

53
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,004
I don't want to talk about him.

54
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him!

55
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,094
You hungry?

56
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,054
Yeah.

57
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,597
Good, I'm hungry too.

58
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,476
You think Leroy's hungry?

59
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:47,648
Do you want some more coffee?

60
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,940
Yeah, thanks.

61
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,150
Here.

62
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,181
So what kind of work do you
planning on getting up here?

63
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,289
Anything like...

64
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,999
I haven't decided yet.

65
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,168
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

66
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,586
Don't start with me Otis.

67
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,672
I can do lots of things mister.

68
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,923
Oh yea, like what?

69
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,508
Like waitressing

70
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,717
or a beautician.

71
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,801
Yeah.

72
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,888
After seeing you I might
just try brain surgery.

73
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,809
You're a card.

74
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,143
Yeah, I'm the queen.

75
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,896
Yeah, the queen of clubs.

76
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:34,486
Don't make me
sorry I came here, Otis.

Hey, Henry.

80
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,250
I brought you a present.

81
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,585
Where did you get that?

82
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,087
Picked it up.

Pretty nice, huh?

85
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,219
Sure is a beauty.

She's gonna be staying here

89
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,779
with us for a while like I said.

that's for sure.

96
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,167

Oh.

101
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,549
She can sleep on the couch.

102

No, no.

to take the spare room.

a bother, we'll change.

I got some work to do today.

113

a little more work.

Oh, it's so gross.

175
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,745
I always did hate doing this.

176
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,828
I'll do it.

177
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,498
That's alright.

178
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,088
Where did you say you met him?

179
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,173
Who?

180
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,383
You know who, Henry.

181
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,136
What do you want to know for?

182
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,221
I don't know.

183
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,974
I'm just curious.

184
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,143
Van Dalia.

185
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,520
Van Dalia?

186
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,855
Sure, Van Dalia.

187
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,440
Oh,

188
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,234
what was he in for?

189
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,069
You don't want to know.

190
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,113
What did he do, kill his mama?

191
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,114
Uh-huh.

192
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,199
Come on, what was he in for?

193
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,200
You don't want to know.

194
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,994
What did he do,
rob a bank or something?

195
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,455
You were right the first time.

196
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,289
Huh?

197
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,500
You were right the first time.

198
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,044
He killed his mama.

199
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,338
Don't you ever
tell him I told you.

200
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,464
You're kidding me?

201
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,340
No, I ain't.

202
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,216
Yes you are.

203
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,759
Alright, I'm kidding you.

204
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,095
Just don't ever
tell him I told you.

205
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,097
He killed his mama?

206
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,306
With a baseball bat.

207
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,101
Her and one of her boyfriends.

208
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,453
I swear if you ever
tell him I told you

209
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,146
I'll beat your ass right off.

210
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,397
How do you know all this?

211
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,107
He told me, that's how I know.

212
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,233
How else would I know?

213
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,460
Were you cellmates or something?

214
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,320
No, we were friends.

215
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:15,655
When did he get out?

216
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,158
A couple of years before me.

217
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,537
<i>(Door opening)</i>

218
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,542
Hi.

219
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,414
I got some business
I got to take care of.

220
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,165
You going out?

221
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,625
Yeah, for a while,

222
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,710
I got to run an
errand for a fellow.

223
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,588
You want to come along Henry?

224
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,465
No, you go ahead.

225
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,091
Okay.

226
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,676
See you later.

227
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,106
Want to play cards?

228
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,233
<i>U-'nu.</i>

229
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,039
What was your daddy like?

230
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,750
My daddy?

231
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,085
He used to drive a truck

232
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,005
before he got his legs cut off.

233
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,049
I remember one time,

234
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,177
he brought me and my
little brother home bicycles.

235
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,553
He had delivered some that day

236
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,390
and he had a couple leftover.

237
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,725
But, mine was
way too big for me,

238
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:08,851
and my brother

239
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,938
he couldn't ride his anyway.

240
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,856
Daddy, he said I'd grow into it,

241
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,067
but, I never did.

242
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,069
Why not?

243
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,362
I never got the chance,

244
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,322
they sold it.

245
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,241
They sold them both.

246
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,913
So you have a brother?

247
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:29,747
My brother,

248
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,749
he had a bone disorder.

249
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,253
He was a little deformed.

250
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,131
What happened to him?

251
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,049
He died.

252
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,347
I can't ever remember

253
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,266
really liking my daddy.

254
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,225
I wanted to,

255
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,395
I really did.

256
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,230
One time he bought me,

257
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,150
when I was about five,

258
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,402
he bought me an ice cream cone

259
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,113
and I dropped it.

260
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,197
And he slapped me

261
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:06,701
and made me
pick it up and eat it.

262
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,372
I never liked my daddy.

263
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,082
One time,

264
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,084
when my momma was at work,

265
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,337
and I was about 13,

266
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,338
he come into my room

267
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,133
and he told me to
take my shirt off

268
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,428
'cause he wanted to see
how I was developed.

269
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,512
And when I wouldn't

270
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,557
he got real mad and he hit me.

271
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
And he told me he had a right

272
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,351
because he was my daddy

273
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,020
and I was his daughter

274
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,688
and he fed me

275
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,440
and let me live in his house

276
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,235
and he could do
whatever he wanted.

277
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,739
And he did.

278
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,699
Then he started coming
into my room a lot,

279
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,369
after that.

280
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,453
And I didn't fight him

281
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,915
because when
I did he just hit me.

282
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,001
I was afraid I was
going to have a baby

283
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,962
and that my baby
would be deformed

284
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,298
but, I never got pregnant.

285
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,428
I tried to tell mama,

286
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:11,391
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

287
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,975
She pretended not to believe me

288
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,311
but I knew she did.

289
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,400
It sure is good to talk...

290
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,403
to talk to you Henry,

291
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,237
because I know

292
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,321
you're not judgmental

293
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,532
or anything like that.

294
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,596
I never would have married
Leroy in the first place

295
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,748
if I hadn't wanted to get
away from daddy so bad.

296
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,418
Didn't get along
with your daddy, huh?

297
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,927
Did you really kill your mama?

298
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,220
What?

299
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,683
Did you really kill your mama?

300
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,145
I guess I did.

301
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:01,107
How did it happen?

302
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,942
I stabbed her.

303
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,321
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

304
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,407
Otis said that?

305
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,658
Yeah.

306
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,954
Well, he's mistaken.

307
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,914
Well, don't tell him I told you,

308
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:20,460
he made me promise.

309
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:24,589
She must have
treated you real bad.

310
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,679
She was a whore.

311
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:36,017
My mama was a whore.

312
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,561
Butldon1 fault her for that.

313
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,562
It ain't what she done

314
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,814
it's how she done it.

315
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,193
As long as I can remember

316
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,780
she'd be bringing
men up to the house.

317
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,115
My daddy was there too

318
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:56,037
but it didn't
matter none to her.

319
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,499
She'd make me watch it.

320
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:01,501
That's creepy.

321
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,463
She beat me too, a lot.

322
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,217
She beat me when
I wouldn't watch it.

323
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,094
And sometime she'd beat me

324
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,597
make me wear a dress

325
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,683
and watch her doing it.

326
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,019
And then they'd laugh at me.

327
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,522
She made you wear a dress?

328
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,732
You think I'm lying?

329
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,197
I feel like I know you.

330
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,534
Like I've known
you for a long time.

331
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,912
I feel like I've known
you for ever and ever.

332
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,755
Yeah...

333
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,301
I killed my mama...

334
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,595
One night,

335
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,057
It was my 14th birthday

336
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,768
and she was drunk and,

337
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,729
we had an argument.

338
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:08,568
She hit me with
a whiskey bottle.

339
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,653
And I shot her.

340
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,656
I shot her dead.

341
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,158
I thought you said
you stabbed her?

342
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,374
Oh yeah.

343
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,588
That's right.

344
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,923
I stabbed her.

345
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:36,596
<i>(Door opening)</i>

346
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,267
Hey.

347
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,692
Anything good on TV?

348
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,755
I got a job today.

349
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,422
Oh yeah?

350
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,256
Doing what?

351
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,549
At a beauty parlor.

352
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,550
A beauty parlor?

353
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,135
I'm a shampoo girl.

354
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,303
What's that?

355
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,805
What's it sound like, you dummy?

356
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,681
How the hell should I know?

357
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,599
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?

358
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,142
I give shampoos,

359
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,466
a woman gets her hair shampooed

360
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,519
before she gets it cut

361
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,689
and I do it.

362
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,357
They pay you for that?

363
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,817
Of course they do.

364
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,378
Besides I used to
do it some back home

365
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,903
after I met Leroy.

366
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,197
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

367
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,492
Don't start with me Otis.

368
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,827
You used to dance naked?

369
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,495
Sure, all the time
around the house.

370
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,746
Otis.

371
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,307
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.

372
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,208
You never.

373
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,795
Were you really a dancer?

374
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,130
I danced some,

375
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,840
in a club,

376
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,883
and I wasn't naked.

377
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,678
I wore a costume.

378
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,763
But I guess it wasn't very much.

379
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,889
Oh.

380
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,392
When you gonna dance for us?

381
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,020
When the pope
pees in his hat, Otis.

382
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,647
Ain't she got a mouth on her?

383
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,898
I better have something on me

384
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,859
to defend me
from a pig like you.

385
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>(Making pig sounds)</i>

386
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,361
Otis.

387
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,450
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.

388
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,243
Thank you Henry.

389
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,621
At least there's one
gentleman at this table.

390
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:08,789
Oh, I'm sorry honey,

391
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,166
now don't get mad.

392
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,834
I was just having
a little fun with you,

393
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,836
that's all.

394
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,336
Oh, wait,

395
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,397
I got something to show you.

396
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:15,838
What?

397
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Wait.

398
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,927
Ta-da!

399
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,346
Nice.

400
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,848
Real nice.

401
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,849
Put it on.

402
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,725
Right now?

403
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:30,269
Uh-huh.

404
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,897
Okay, but turn around first.

405
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,981
Turn around.

406
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,590
Okay, you can look.

407
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,886
What does it say on there?

408
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,597
I love Chicago.

409
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,598
Looks good,

410
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,599
don't it Otis?

411
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,975
Uh-huh.

412
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:14,814
Oh, hey honey,

413
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,082
Why don't you bring me a beer,

414
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,900
this one's empty.

I ain't your maid,

416
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,444
get it yourself.

417
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,071
Oh, now come on honey,

418
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,364
I ain't asking you

419
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,407
to wash the windows or nothing,

420
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,408
I just want a beer.

421
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,495
Come on, bring your poor
old brother a beer, will ya?

422
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,211
Don't do that Otis,

she's your sister!

424
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,047
Okay, I was only
kidding around, Henry.

425
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,632
Tell her you're sorry.

426
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,759
Okay, I'm sorry.

427
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,970
Now, tell her you
won't do it again.

428
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:46,971
I won't,

429

That's alright.

435
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,028
Listen, I'll do the dishes.

436
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,488
I don't mind.

437
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:05,990
I don't.

go out and get a beer.

440
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,007
I'll do these,

441
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,718
I don't mind, honest.

442
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,936
Well, what do you say Otis?

443
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,900
You want to go grab a beer?

444
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,035
Sure, I don't mind.

445
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,085
I'll just go spruce up.

That was a real
nice supper, Becky.

447

Aah, mmh,

00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,184
Easy.

454
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,857
Oh, come on, slow down!

I'll drive.

Nothing.

What do you mean nothing?

470
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,191

nothing.

00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,150
I ain't saying that.

483
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,569
Then you've killed
before, right?

484
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,530
Well, maybe I didn't
have no choice.

485
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,034
You didn't have no
choice here neither.

Did you?

487
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:46,872
Huh?

488
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,290
Did you?

489
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,584
I don't know,

490
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,338
it ain't the same.

491
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,757
It's always the same,

492
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,384
and it's always different.

493
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,720
What do you mean?

494
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,138
It's either you or them,

495
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:06,141
one way or the other.

496
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,268
Ain't that right?

497
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,315
Open your eyes, Otis.

498
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,275
Look at the world.

499
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,238
It's either you or them.

500
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:22,032
You know what I mean.

501
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,120
Yeah.

502
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,792
Good.

Okay.

505
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,656
There was only one left.

He knows nothing about this

a dollar to a doughnut

that when he finds out,

509
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,630
and he will find out
'cause I'll tell him

510
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,923
there'll be hell to pay.

511
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:20,799
Really.

512
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:21,717
I'll never go back there again

513
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,051
I can tell you that.

514
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,554
Not when he's not there anyway.

515
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,682
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

516
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,100
It's gone down so badly

517
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,226
the way it's changed

518
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,103
it breaks my heart.

519
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,646
It's like that all over.

520
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,648
People spit at you.

521
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,358
I wish I was lying.

522
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,842
Yeah, you can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.

523
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,436
Ah, shit!

524
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,109
Fuck.

525
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,366
What did you do that for?

526
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,452
I guess I got carried away.

527
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,039
Well, I guess you did, Otis.

528
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:39,628
Shit, I got to have a TV.

529
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,798
Well, let's go shopping.

530
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,348
So what can I do
for you gentlemen?

531
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,516
It's hot in here, isn't it?

532
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,393
I'm kind of cold.

533
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,770
We want a TV.

534
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,064
How much you got to spend?

535
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:42,357
What do you got?

536
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,443
50 bucks.

537
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,612
I can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

538
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:48,405
Well, turn it on

539
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:49,531
we want to see if it works.

540
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,324
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

541
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,493
Uh-uh.

542
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:57,330
Here plug it in down there.

543
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:58,665
Here?

544
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,292
Yeah, down there, real good.

545
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,377
I see you've had some college.

546
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,755
Like you can see
it works real good.

547
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,507
Just takes a while to warm up.

548
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:08,800
It's black and white!

549
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,552
Of course it's black and white.

550
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,179
What do you expect for 50 bucks?

551
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,763
Fuckin' 3-D for Christ sake.

552
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,557
Well, how much is color?

553
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,975
We want color.

554
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,060
You can't get
color for 50 dollars.

555
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,437
That's okay,

556
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,646
let's see what you got.

557
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,440
What have I got?

558
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,523
You want cable ready?

559
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:25,817
You want remote control?

560
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,527
You want UHF?

561
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,445
You want 13"?

562
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,238
You want 19"?

563
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,032
I bet you'd like to have a 19".

564
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,450
You want Sony?

565
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,160
You want Zenith?

566
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:37,245
You want a Gold Star?

567
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,456
What can we get for a $150?

568
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,541
I can let you have
this set for $150.

569
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,168
It's worth $300.

570
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,544
But here, take a look at this.

571
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,088
For an extra $75,

572
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,841
you can take this $600 set.

573
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,552
What's this?

574
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,845
It's a camcorder.

575
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:54,554
What?

576
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:55,847
It's a videotape recorder

577
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,641
and camera rolled into one.

578
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,100
You just pop in a cassette

579
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,060
and you're ready to go.

580
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,496
You can make your
own movies with that?

581
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,605
What else would you do with it?

582
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,981
How much you want for it?

583
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,149
It's worth a grand,

584
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:07,526
I'd take half.

585
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,485
500 bucks?

586
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,154
Yeah, half of a grand is $500.

587
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,238
That's a little more

588
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,740
than we were planning to spend.

589
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,951
I think we should
just take the TV.

590
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,495
Okay, which one do you want?

591
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:21,873
The $50 one.

592
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,667
The $50 one.

593
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,543
You guys come in here,

594
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:25,627
I show this,

595
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,087
I show you that,

596
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,506
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend.

597
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

598
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,842
Take the $50 set

599
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,843
and get the hell out,

600
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:34,927
I'm a busy man.

601
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,139
Well, we were really
counting on a color set.

602
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:38,890
What's the matter,

603
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,600
You got shit in your ears?

604
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:42,060
The black and white is $50,

605
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,436
take it or leave it.

606
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,896
Sorry we wasted your time,

607
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,730
come on, Otis.

608
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:49,025
Don't give me
sorry, you dumb ass!

609
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,235
Did I stutter?

610
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,320
Gimme the $50 and get out!

611
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:52,988
I'll give you 50...

No!

617
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,769
Otis,

618
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,521
Plug  it in.

gets busted up in a fight.

685
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,385
Yeah.

686
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:03,094
Okay,

687
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,722
You still working at Bobs Gas?

688
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,805
Yes sir.

689
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,100
Good, you working everyday?

690
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,727
Two, three days a week.

691
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,728
It's a little slow now.

692
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,897
Well, if it's less than
two days a week let me know.

693
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,260
We'll see what
we can do for you.

694
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,233
You still living
at 1801 West North?

695
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,735
Yes sir.

696
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,360
Good.

697
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,779
I got to cut it
short today, Otis.

698
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,697
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

699
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:23,841
I promised to take him over.

700
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:24,908
Sure.

701
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,535
Good, I'll see you next month.

702
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,412
Take it easy.

703
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:30,872
Bye.

704
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:52,811
You got it?

705
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,312
Got what?

706
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,980
You know what.

707
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
Here you go.

708
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,987
You wanna try it?

709
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,330
Ooh!

710
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,210
God damn, you son of a bitch!

711
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,254
Fuckin'...!

712
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,090
Damn it!

713
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:26,844
<i>Fucker.</i>

714
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,347
Let me see that.

715
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,559
That little fuckin' bastard.

716
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:33,434
I ought to kill him.

717
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,894
I ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

718
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:36,813
That'd be a mistake.

719
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,065
Look who's talking.

720
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,652
Watch your mouth Otis.

721
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,696
I'm sorry, Henry.

722
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,881
You kill that high school boy

723
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,115
they're going to slap your ass

724
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,533
right back in jail.

725
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,368
Otis that's a promise.

726
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,912
People have seen you together.

727
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,123
I'd still like
to kill him though.

728
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,833
I bet you would.

729
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,252
I'd like to kill somebody.

730
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,838
Say that again.

731
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,882
I'd like to kill somebody.

732
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,925
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.

733
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:40,895
Here, I want to
show you something.

734
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,146
Where'd you get this?

735
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,272
Careful Otis,

736
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,358
it's loaded.

737
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,526
Where'd you get it?

738
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,486
Guns are easy to get.

739
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,445
I can make a phone call

740
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:50,822
and get a gun.

741
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,615
Anybody can get a gun Otis.

742
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,450
What do you got in mind Henry?

743
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,035
What do you think?

744
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,749
I don't know.

745
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,459
Put up the hood.

746
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:04,335
Why?

747
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,546
Just put up the hood, Otis.

748
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,259
You guys need any help?

749
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,553
Otis, do you need some help,

750
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,639
or can you do it yourself?

751
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:11,819
Feel better?

752
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,905
Yeah.

753
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,281
Alright.

754
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,128
If you shoot somebody

755
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:30,546
in the head with a 45

756
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,507
every time you kill somebody

757
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,301
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.

758
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,803
But if you strangle one

759
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:37,929
and stab another,

760
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,222
one you cut up

761
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,431
one you don't

762
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,642
then the police
don't know what to do.

763
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,144
They think you're
four different people.

764
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,105
What they really like,

765
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,232
what makes their
job so much easier,

766
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,192
a pattern.

767
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,612
What they call a modus operandi.

768
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,114
That's Latin.

769
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,116
Bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

770
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,119
Big fuckin' deal.

771
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,202
What?

772
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,955
Nothing.

773
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,792
It's like a trail of shit, Otis.

774
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,127
It's like a blood droppings

775
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,045
from a deer you've shot

776
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,129
and all they gotta do

777
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,339
is follow those droppings

778
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,218
and pretty soon they're
going to find that deer.

779
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:31,232
Why do we use a gun?

780
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,151
You can use a gun.

781
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,027
I'm not saying
you can't use a gun.

782
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:38,239
Just don't use
the same gun twice.

783
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,327
The most important
thing is to keep moving.

784
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:47,290
That way they might
never catch up to you.

785
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,291
I'm gonna have to pack up

786
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,168
and be on the move
too, pretty soon.

787
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,211
Where are you going?

788
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,588
Nowhere.

789
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,007
You wanna come?

790
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,677
We could be back this
way in about a month.

791
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,220
I'm not supposed
to leave the state

792
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,096
without telling them.

793
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,180
So who's gonna know?

794
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,223
As long as you show up

795
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,309
when you're supposed to?

796
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,187
What if they check
up on me at work?

797
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,899
Well, no plan is perfect.

798
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,123
Bring her in.

799
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:12,083
Bring her in Otis.

800
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,209
Come on.

801
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,961
That's it.

802
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:15,711
Yeah, yeah.

803
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,379
Sit down.

804
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,381
Sit her down.

805
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,566
Oh, good, good,
good, good, good.

806
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,466
Take her blouse off.

807
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,634
Take it off.

808
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:24,845
Oh yeah, Otis, good.

809
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,348
My 0h, yeah, yeah.

810
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,058
Skirt, skirt, skirt.

811
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:29,725
Do it Otis,

812
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:30,977
you're a star.

813
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:37,316
<i>(Man gagged and screaming)</i>

814
00:54:39,819 --> 00:54:40,861
Shut up!

815
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,196
Shut up!

816

I'll do what the hell
I want to do bitch!

Leave me alone!

Leave me alone!

819
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,247
Do it Otis.

820
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,707
Do it.

821
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,625
Henry look.

822
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,377
You got it.

823
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,670
Go for it boy.

824
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:02,925
Shut up!

825
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,304

Henry?

834
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,366
What?

00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:09,283
Hi!

00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,242
Looky here, where you at.

837
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:11,118
Bye!

838
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,827
Where you at?

839
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,579
Say hello, honey!

Henry, look at this, Henry.

843
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,752
Ain't that a view.

844
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,545
Otis!

845
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,131
No, Otis!

846
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,508
Otis!

847
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,635
No!

848
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,845
Let's go!

849
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,238
What are you doing?

850
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,989
I want to see it again.

851
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:28,612
In jail?

852
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,114
Are you sure?

853
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,661
Is Lurleen there?

854
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,329
Does she know?

855
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,166
In the what,

856
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,001
in the army?

857
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,463
Go get her, will you?

858
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,510
Hi.

859
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,220
Hi.

860
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,014
Hi, hi.

861
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:59,602
Do you miss me?

862
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,896
I miss you.

863
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,276
You did?

864
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,488
That's wonderful.

865
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,406
Are you being a good girl?

866
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,163
I don't think so honey.

867
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,458
I know I promised, but uh...

868
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,085
a couple of things
have happened here.

869
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,592
I know, he is a good soldier.

870
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,723
Soon, real soon, I promise.

871
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:42,853
I love you, too.

872
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,690
Yeah, put your
grandma back on, okay?

873
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:51,570
Hi.

874
00:58:55,366 --> 00:58:56,283
I know.

875
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,910
I'll think about it.

876
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:04,166
I can't right now.

877
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,626
I will, soon.

878
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,380
I can't talk now okay,

879
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,799
I gotta go.

880
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,467
Okay.

881
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,802
Bye.

882
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,518
Great, great.

883
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,978
Oh!

884
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,771
Oh!

885
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,107
I got one,
I got one, here, look.

886
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,025
Oh, look, look,
look, look, look.

887
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:30,943
Look at this, look at this.

888
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,486
Tight on there huh.

889
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,737
Yeah, no, no, no,

890
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:34,965
oh, no, I like this one better.

891
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,032
Look Henry, Henry look.

892
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,242
Oh, yeah, I love it,

893
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,076
I love her.

894
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,118
Oh god, how she looks,

895
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,579
isn't she pretty.

896
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:43,038
Ah god, look at that dress,

897
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,582
look at the way it moves.

898
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,250
Oh yeah!

899
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,377
Pull up next to her, real slow.

900
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,920
<i>(Hits camera)</i>

901
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:52,673
Look what you did!

902
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,924
Oh God!

903
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,010
Oh Jesus!

904
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,722
Look at it, it's ruined.

905
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,308
Damn Henry you ought to
look where you're driving.

906
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,017
Who the hell told you

907
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,977
to stick your head
out the window anyway?

908
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,061
You could have killed me!

909
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,271
Oh, that's right.

910
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,065
Blame it on me!

911
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:13,527
Oh, this fucking camera!

912
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:16,071
What did you do that for?

913
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,990
It wasn't any good anymore.

914
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,408
Could have fixed it.

915
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,744
Shit, the lens was
busted right off!

916
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,703
Could have fixed it!

917
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,621
How do you know,

918
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:26,665
you a camera repair man.

919
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:27,809
You should have said something.

920
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,251
You didn't give
me a chance, Otis.

921
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,170
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

922
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,671
It ain't my fault it broke.

923
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,465
Oh right.

924
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,218
Go back and get it if you want.

925
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,511
Yeah.

926
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:48,687
Want to get a beer?

927
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:50,689
Not particularly.

928
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,524
I want a beer.

929
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,737
If you want a beer so bad, Otis,

930
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,782
go ahead and get one.

931
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,784
All right, I Will.

932
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:06,538
See you later.

933
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:07,998
Yeah.

934
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,674
I talked to Lurleen.

935
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,801
Yeah?

936
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,387
You'd like her.

937
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,306
God, I miss her.

938
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,891
I'm thinking,

939
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,687
I might be heading on back home.

940
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,313
I quit.

941
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:33,148
You quit what?

942
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,610
My job.

943
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:37,736
What happened?

944
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,820
Nothing.

945
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,699
I just figured it
was time to go home.

946
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:48,038
You want to come with me?

947
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:50,416
I thought you wanted
to make some money?

948
01:01:50,499 --> 01:01:53,377
Yeah, but,

949
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,753
I'm thinking,

950
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:57,131
I don't want to bring
Lurleen up here after all.

951
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,049
You know, that was my intention.

952
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,471
There's just too
much going on up here.

953
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,223
She'd get lost.

954
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:13,689
We're better off
living with mama.

955
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,774
I can work back home,

956
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,736
I won't make as much
money I'm sure, but,

957
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,821
I won't need as much either.

958
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,409
And I can live with mama.

959
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,830
You can stay there, too.

960
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,957
You figure it's safe to go back?

961
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,752
I hope so.

962
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,170
Leroy's in jail for murder

963
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,047
and his bond's
a million dollars.

964
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,550
So, unless he wins the lottery

965
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,096
Leroy won't be going
anywhere for quite a while.

966
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,849
Where's Otis?

967
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,311
He had a dinner
date I think he said.

968
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,937
Really?

969
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,230
Well.

970
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,693
Come with me?

971
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,653
When are you leaving?

972
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,865
Tomorrow.

973
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:05,949
Hmm.

974
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:13,165
Better think fast Henry.

975
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,958
You got your ticket?

976
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:16,919
Not yet.

977
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,713
But my mind's made up.

978
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:21,799
Might as well just do it.

979
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,721
Might as well.

980
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,182
I'd rather ride with you.

981
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:35,354
Let me think about it.

982
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,733
I'll tell you what,

983
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:40,859
let's me and you

984
01:03:40,943 --> 01:03:42,236
go get us a steak dinner,

985
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,946
I'm buying, huh.

986
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,865
I got a new Visa card
I want to try out.

987
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:48,242
You've got a Visa card?

988
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,954
Yeah, who you think you're
associating with anyway?

989
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,540
Great, let's go.

990
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,415
Alright.

991
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,834
Where are we going?

992
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,585
We'll find a place.

993
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,172
Grab your jacket and let's go.

994
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,982
I gotta go to the bathroom.

995
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,233
Okay.

996
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,965
He's passed out.

997
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:43,023
I ain't
interrupting nothing, am I?

998
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,989
You guys want a beer?

999
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,035
You got any cigarettes?

1000
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,079
Not since Superman died.

1001
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,585
I gotta, go out and
get some cigarettes,

1002
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:04,294
get some air.

1003
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:05,128
Henry?

1004
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,046
I'll be right back I promise,

1005
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,547
I just need some air.

1006
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:10,467
You want anything?

1007
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:15,931
Otis?

1008
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,849
Uh-uh.

1009
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:28,819
How about getting your
poor 0l' brother a beer?

1010
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,163
Hi.

1011
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,246
Two packs of Kools.

1012
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:22,998
What kind?

1013
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,041
What?

1014
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:24,750
What kind?

1015
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,960
Milds, Regulars, 100's...

1016
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,253
Regulars.

1017
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,007
Two, sixty.

1018
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,099
Hey, how about those Bears?

1019
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,018
Fuck the Bears.

1020
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,480
Okay.

1021
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,079
Hi.

1022
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,162
Hi.

1023
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,165
That's a nice looking
dog you got there.

1024
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,291
Thank you.

1025
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,210
What kind is it?

1026
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,419
Heinz.

1027

01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:12,881
57 varieties.

What?

1030
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,550
It's a mutt,

01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,260
half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

1032
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:20,472
Oh, Shitzu, huh.

1033
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,848
What's his name?

1034
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,308
Delores.

1035
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,101
What?

1036
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,104
Her name is Delores.

1037
01:08:27,187 --> 01:08:30,232
That's a nice name.

1038
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,608
Hear that Delores?

1039
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,318
Say thank you.

1040
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,863
We gotta go.

01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:38,448

No, no, no, easy.

No, no, no.

What about Otis?

1058
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:42,924
It's not a good idea.

1059

No.

What are we going to do?

Shut up, let me think!

Shut up!

You want to listen to the radio?

1069
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,261
That was so awful.

1070
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,724
I'm scared.

1071
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,564
What do we do now?

1072
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:27,941
We just got to keep moving,

that's for sure.

My sister owns a ranch

1075
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:35,740
outside San Bernardino.

1076
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,493
She raises horses there.

1077
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,079
She's got about
1/2 dozen of them.

1078
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,205
Arabians.

We can stay there

What about Lurleen?

1082
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,217
We'll send for her,

soon as we get there.

I promise.

I guess, I love you too.

1088
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,086
Where are we going to go now?

1089
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,088
We'll find a place.

1090

This is a nice guitar.

01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:22,240
I used to play a little.

1095
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,867
But, I'm out of practice.

1096
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,958
We better go to bed now.
