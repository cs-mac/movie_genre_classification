1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,270
You can´t...

2
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:12,378
have my daughter.

3
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,918
No.

4
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:23,427
No. Stay away!

5
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:25,964
Stay out of here.

6
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:33,442
Stay out!

7
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:40,652
She´s my daughter!

8
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,402
Stay away.

9
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,323
Mommy.

10
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,661
Mommy, come and play with me...

11
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:57,198
in my room.

12
00:02:57,265 --> 00:03:00,470
Right now, Mommy. Okay?

13
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:04,442
l got an idea.

14
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:16,460
No! Let go of me!

15
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:19,898
No! Who will protect her? No!

16
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,734
Let me go!

17
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,403
Rachel! Rachel!

18
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,640
No! l can´t leave her!

19
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,177
l have to protect her! Rachel!

20
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:29,679
Okay, Rachel...

21
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:34,954
your momma´s gotta go somewhere to get
some rest so she´ll feel better, okay?

22
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:37,591
Are you okay?

23
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:40,862
ls your dad around?

24
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,865
l don´t have a dad.

25
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:47,405
Okay, here´s what we´re gonna do.

26
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,742
We´re gonna take you someplace
real nice...

27
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:53,247
with a really nice family
until we get this sorted out, okay?

28
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:16,548
Rachel!

29
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,903
Stop it!

30
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,505
Stop!

31
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,241
Stop it!

32
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,208
Hello. lt´s Monday morning.
Time to get up and go to work.

33
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,345
But never fear because
the Moneyman is here...

34
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,261
Sorry, Walt.

35
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:51,354
- Are you workin´ tonight?
- They moved me to the graveyard shift.

36
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:53,357
Was the dog in the house last night?

37
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:56,195
He´s allowed in the morning.

38
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,865
Daytime´s okay,
but not at night.

39
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,202
l only let him in this morning.

40
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,939
There´s no juice.

41
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,809
We´re out of a lot of things.

42
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,047
l heard dog noises last night
when l was trying to sleep.

43
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:11,150
Walter was not in the house last night.

44
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:12,919
That voice!

45
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:15,089
As long as you´re under this roof...

46
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:18,694
you´ll respect us as your parents
and treat us like that.

47
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:20,297
Sorry.

48
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:24,937
Take it easy, Boyd.
She might not be with us much longer.

49
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:27,741
Your mom´s making progress, right?

50
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,078
On her new medication,
the Clozaril?

51
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:33,015
Where are we gonna make up
that 300 bucks a month?

52
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,188
May l be excused?

53
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:44,065
Well, hello.

54
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:45,968
Oh, she speaks.

55
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:49,673
Her mouth opens, and sounds come out.

56
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,312
She didn´t call all weekend.
l figured her voice was gone.

57
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,116
What´s wrong?
Foster dad being a pain again?

58
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,618
Yeah.

59
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,091
Why are you so weirdly happy?

60
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:04,395
Do l look any different?

61
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,398
Do you look any--

62
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,105
Oh, my God!
You did it?

63
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,707
Yeah.

64
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:14,877
Who?

65
00:07:14,944 --> 00:07:18,015
You wouldn´t believe me if l just
told you, so l´m bringing him to lunch.

66
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:22,054
- You suck.
- Oh, love you too.

67
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:27,595
- Best blood.
- One. Two. Three.

68
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,164
Four.

69
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:33,337
Are you ready to beat beat?

70
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,424
Morning, ladies.
How you doin´ this morning?

71
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,628
What´s goin´ on, bro?
Get away from me!

72
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,832
Dude, according to these new rules...

73
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,535
how many points do l get
if l do that chick over there?

74
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,939
The fat one? Six.

75
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:23,044
No, bro, l did her last week and you
only gave me five. And she´s not fat.

76
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,248
Yeah, but l figure if he´s got the balls
to go in after you, you dirty shit...

77
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,251
l´m giving him an extra point.

78
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:34,260
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Jesse, that Tracy girl.

79
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,697
You gotta get all over that girl, man.

80
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,199
Serious, bro.

81
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,436
- She´s on my list.
- She´s definitely fine.

82
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,639
She got an ass stamped B.P., baby!

83
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,776
Bulldog property.

84
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,317
Can you develop these at work for me?

85
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:01,467
- Total coyote date.
- That´s harsh, bro.

86
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,969
lt´s the truth.

87
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,673
- What´s a coyote date?
- You don´t know?

88
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,211
That´s when you wake up in the morning,
some ugly chick sleeping on your arm...

89
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,182
and you´d rather gnaw it off
than have to wake her up.

90
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:16,990
God, woman, you come prepared.

91
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,695
Tell me who the special someone is.

92
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,499
All will be revealed in due time.

93
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,398
""Romeo and Juliet,"" a tale...

94
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:49,971
of star-crossed lovers, pulled apart
by their families, society...

95
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:53,643
and, some might say, by fate.

96
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,884
Why is it that we are so moved by love
that ends with separation?

97
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:00,387
What say?

98
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,757
Anyone.

99
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:05,527
Anyone!

100
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,240
l don´t know that l believe in it.

101
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,243
Believe in what?

102
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,480
Love.

103
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:24,021
Well, then you´ve got bigger problems
than passing this class.

104
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:27,193
- Who would love her?
- Yes, Arnold.

105
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,998
""Love is 15 seconds
of squishing noises.""

106
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:33,201
Unquote. Johnny Rotten.
Know what l´m saying?

107
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:36,006
Dork. Kill that kid.

108
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,142
Do you think all love stories
are tragedies?

109
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,046
Unless they die at the same time...

110
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:45,119
all lovers are eventually separated
by death, right?

111
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:51,028
Then ""Romeo and Juliet"" isn´t a tragedy.
They could only be together in death.

112
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:54,633
Yes! Very good!

113
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:58,105
A foul cynic, most cliche.

114
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:03,346
- A true romantic. How refreshing!
- Yeah.

115
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,517
Shut up.

116
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,451
Oh, hello there.

117
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,625
Hey, girls, what´s happenin´?

118
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:37,329
Move out. Thank you.

119
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,901
Mark Bing wanted me to invite you
to his party Friday night.

120
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,875
- ls Jesse going with anyone?
- l don´t think so.

121
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:48,445
Could you please refrain
from shooting my ass?

122
00:12:31,976 --> 00:12:34,046
Lisa.

123
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,991
Did you see that?

124
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:11,434
Oh, my God!

125
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:18,211
Let´s go. Stay back, please.

126
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,780
Let´s stay back.

127
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,980
You better come with me.
A girl just killed herself in the lot.

128
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,484
Stay here.

129
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,058
Best blood.

130
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,695
Oh, my God.

131
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,168
Rachel, come on, back away.

132
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:26,010
Attention all students.
Report to your homeroom classes.

133
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:34,656
Oh, man.
Whose car is this?

134
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:41,366
She was really happy this morning.

135
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,903
l don´t understand why she--

136
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,375
lt´s okay.

137
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:49,678
Let it out.

138
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,181
No.

139
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,819
l don´t cry.

140
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,830
Miss Snell, please report
to the principal´s office.

141
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:05,001
Miss Snell, please come
to the principal´s office.

142
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:08,640
l have to go.

143
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,310
Rachel, stay here, okay?

144
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,814
l´ll be back as soon as l can.

145
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,107
One of our students died today.

146
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:37,549
We will observe at exactly 1:00 p.m.
a moment of silence.

147
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:44,960
- Lisa Parker may be gone.
- Hand me the score book.

148
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:48,565
But she will not be forgotten
by her friends.

149
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:51,803
She will not be forgotten
by her fellow students.

150
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,973
She will not be forgotten
by her teachers...

151
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,511
or by her school.

152
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,708
Her parents are going to want
all this.

153
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,021
Oh, my.

154
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,024
That girl Lisa, right?

155
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah.

156
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:34,032
l was supposed to have lunch
with her today.

157
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,534
Yeah?

158
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:43,546
You guys thought she was shit, right?
Mark.

159
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,715
Don´t look at me like this. You guys
said it. You thought she was shit.

160
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,218
What did you do?

161
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,354
Nothing. l didn´t do anything.

162
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:56,231
lt´s just Lisa was acting all happy,
you know, like we were going steady.

163
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:59,369
And l had to break the news to her
that she was just a pump.

164
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,238
You know, a nut.

165
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,675
She didn´t mean anything to me.

166
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,582
l guess she couldn´t handle it.

167
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:12,755
ls that your brilliant attempt
to fix it?

168
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,360
That´s good.

169
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:20,467
You need all the points you can get.
l don´t know why you´re erasing them.

170
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:22,469
That´s cold, man.

171
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:28,979
On Friday we have the Kings University
scout coming to the game.

172
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,317
lf all this gets out--
Sex and suicide.

173
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,423
Come on, man. Catholic schools
frown on that shit.

174
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,397
lf l don´t get into a good school,
my dad´s gonna kill me.

175
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:44,468
But nobody´s gonna find out about this.

176
00:17:47,873 --> 00:17:49,943
Lisa took a picture of us last night.

177
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,416
What if her parents ask questions?

178
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,419
That´s a problem.

179
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,422
Oh, shit.

180
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,729
All right, l´ll handle it.
l´ll take care of it.

181
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:06,668
How?

182
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,671
Relax, man. Come on.

183
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,507
Come on.

184
00:19:05,154 --> 00:19:08,125
- Sorry. Didn´t mean to scare you.
- lt´s all right.

185
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:09,861
You´re Rachel, right?

186
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,565
Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,801
l´m Jesse. English?

188
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:16,871
Right.

189
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,373
The true romantic?

190
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,045
- Yeah.
- Rachel, listen. That Lisa girl?

191
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:26,218
She had these pictures that have
what you might call sentimental value.

192
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,822
l figured 20 bucks ought to cover it.

193
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:34,764
What do you want, 30?

194
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,167
They´re not your pictures.

195
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:40,138
lt´s not like she´s gonna be
pickin´ them anytime soon, is it?

196
00:19:41,841 --> 00:19:44,011
Cut it out, man.

197
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,850
All right, Rachel, l´ll tell you what.

198
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,853
How ´bout l swing by
when you get off work?

199
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,856
l´ll take you out for a cruise.

200
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,862
Come on. l don´t bite.

201
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,864
Unless you want me to.

202
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,702
l don´t think so.

203
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,304
Why not?

204
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,046
Because l´m a dyke.

205
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,055
That´s funny.

206
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:17,627
- Don´t laugh, man.
- Just drive.

207
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:57,018
How you doin´ tonight?

208
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,993
""For a moment, l thought someone
was actually seeing me...

209
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,163
but it was all a lie.

210
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,735
Eric lied when he said l was special,
and l guess l was lying to myself.

211
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:10,738
l believed him.""

212
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:15,712
Rachel, is there anything in there
that strikes a chord for you?

213
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,885
Do you know what Lisa
was referring to?

214
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,660
Yesterday, she--

215
00:21:28,831 --> 00:21:31,502
She told me she lost her virginity.

216
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,839
Do you know this boy?

217
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:36,075
Eric Stark.

218
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:37,945
He´s on the team.

219
00:21:38,012 --> 00:21:39,948
Can l talk to you for a second?

220
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:42,017
Excuse us, Rachel.

221
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:48,727
Robbie, l had a freshman girl crying
in the hallway last week.

222
00:21:48,794 --> 00:21:51,765
Five more have been in my office
this semester.

223
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:55,571
l couldn´t get anything out of them,
but their friends told me...

224
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:59,677
that football players slept with them
then dumped them.

225
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,913
There´s nothing illegal
about breaking a girl´s heart.

226
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,217
Eric is 18.

227
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:06,387
Lisa was 16.
That´s statutory rape.

228
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:07,889
That´s a stretch.

229
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:12,796
Let´s make it before someone else´s
daughter jumps off a building.

230
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:16,134
Listen.

231
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,973
Are you sure you´re still not trying
to save a girl that died 20 years ago?

232
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:23,478
Help me!

233
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,184
Plug it up! Plug it up!

234
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:39,235
Okay. l´ll look into it.

235
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:54,925
That was great.

236
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,031
Yeah.

237
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,407
The Minute Man!

238
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:08,645
Do it, baby!
Do it again.

239
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,983
Gimme the book.

240
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,987
That´s in the book. Panties.

241
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,790
Oh, my--

242
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,805
He´s going back in for double time?

243
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,982
l don´t feel good.
l´m gonna be sick.

244
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,519
- He´s gonna puke!
- Not in my car.

245
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:47,535
You know, Mark invited me
to his party on Friday.

246
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:54,479
What are you thinking about?

247
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,982
Nobody.

248
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,488
l asked what, not who.

249
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,624
lt´s nothing.

250
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,237
Doesn´t it bother you that some girl
offed herself yesterday?

251
00:24:12,238 --> 00:24:15,343
- Why? She wasn´t anybody.
- What?

252
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,748
l mean, l didn´t know her.

253
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:27,928
You know, l still don´t have a date
for Mark´s party.

254
00:24:29,964 --> 00:24:31,400
Hint, hint.

255
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,584
Shit!

256
00:24:59,675 --> 00:25:01,110
Stop.

257
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,254
Rachel, stop this.

258
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:37,630
Hey, get back here.

259
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,802
That rotten dog.

260
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,255
Hey, your dumb dog got out.

261
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,012
Walter!

262
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:09,465
Stay!

263
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,803
Stop!

264
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:20,849
Walter! My God!

265
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,541
Stop! Help!

266
00:27:40,611 --> 00:27:42,948
Please stop! Stop!

267
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:46,720
Stop!

268
00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:51,527
Rachel?

269
00:27:51,594 --> 00:27:53,563
- Please.
- What happened?

270
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,566
Please help me.

271
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,297
Are you gonna be all right?

272
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:22,005
Sorry.

273
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:23,507
For what?

274
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:29,015
For making you come out here
all this way.

275
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,885
Don´t worry about it.

276
00:28:30,952 --> 00:28:33,255
And what about my windshield?
How bizarre was that?

277
00:28:33,322 --> 00:28:35,792
l´m sorry about your car.

278
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:39,564
lt wasn´t your fault.
lt was probably a rock or something.

279
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:45,239
Walter´s banged up pretty bad.

280
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,242
Has broken ribs.

281
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,447
He tore an artery in his front leg.
He´s lost quite a bit of blood.

282
00:28:50,514 --> 00:28:52,316
His pressure´s stabilized.

283
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:55,721
He´s gonna make it.

284
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,392
- Can l see him?
- Come back tomorrow.

285
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,094
Any time after 8:00.

286
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:11,278
Don´t worry. lt´s because you look
like a mass murderer.

287
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:19,924
What´s up with the music here?

288
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,728
Don´t they have anything good,
like some Garbage?

289
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,166
- You like Garbage?
- Yeah. Shirley Manson, she rocks.

290
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,110
Lisa loved her.

291
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:39,519
You two were really close, huh?

292
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:46,362
l´m really sorry.

293
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:49,066
Sometimes...

294
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:54,241
l´d see someone from behind...

295
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:56,644
and l´d know...

296
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,650
l´d just know it was Lisa.

297
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,556
And she´d turn around,
and it wasn´t.

298
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:07,160
But sometimes it was.

299
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:08,662
And now...

300
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:14,504
whenever l see someone who looks
like her, and she turns around...

301
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,543
it won´t be.

302
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,714
Ever.

303
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,105
lt´s gettin´ pretty late.

304
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:41,210
- Can l give you a ride home?
- No, l can walk.

305
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:44,414
Yeah, right.

306
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:47,319
l can hitch. Don´t worry about it.

307
00:30:47,385 --> 00:30:49,889
Then you can go hitch.

308
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:52,126
Or l could just...

309
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:55,931
wait for my limo.

310
00:30:55,998 --> 00:30:58,368
Yeah, you could do that.

311
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,304
Just wait for your limo.

312
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:08,516
Come on.

313
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:23,271
All right, l guess
l´ll see you in school tomorrow.

314
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,675
Sure.

315
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:29,981
You´ll let me know
how Walter´s doing?

316
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,484
Yeah.

317
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,755
And thank you...

318
00:31:36,257 --> 00:31:37,693
for everything.

319
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:41,865
Well, good night.

320
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,906
Good night.

321
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,346
- lt´s the dry weather.
- An acrylic sweater.

322
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:58,790
l shook her hand.

323
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:01,728
Thank you for your support.
l´d like your vote.

324
00:32:03,698 --> 00:32:05,567
Stupid.

325
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,404
Lisa!

326
00:32:11,342 --> 00:32:14,881
Don´t! Don´t jump!

327
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:52,169
Last night, l took a look at your file.

328
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,340
Your mom is at Arkham for schizophrenia?

329
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,513
How´s she doing?

330
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,449
She´s gonna be fine.

331
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:06,690
l had a really traumatic experience
in high school.

332
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:11,831
l tried to help someone,
and it backfired horribly.

333
00:33:14,936 --> 00:33:17,272
No, stop!

334
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:21,445
l spent some time at Arkham...

335
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,416
as a patient.

336
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,619
Does that shock you?

337
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:31,026
l guess. l mean, you seem
pretty normal to me.

338
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:36,033
Yeah, well, l try.

339
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:41,508
Do you visit your mom often?

340
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,749
ls that scary for you?

341
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:50,187
What do you mean?

342
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:54,594
lt´s perfectly normal to be afraid
of turning out like your parents.

343
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:56,797
Come on.

344
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:59,835
l know l´m ten times more likely
to get it than most people.

345
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,873
l didn´t mean to patronize you.

346
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,047
So, is that scary for you?

347
00:34:14,523 --> 00:34:15,792
Rachel...

348
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:21,366
in a way you´ve lost your mother...

349
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,870
and now you´ve lost a friend.

350
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:27,409
Losing people close to you can be...

351
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:31,615
very painful and lonely.

352
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,271
- lf you want to talk--
- No!

353
00:34:56,618 --> 00:34:58,054
l´m sorry.

354
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,425
l must´ve knocked it.

355
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:03,929
l didn´t see you knock it.

356
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:12,909
l know.

357
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,414
l know what you did to her.

358
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:31,202
As we can see from last year´s film...

359
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:35,242
the Carlin Devils play tough,
smash-mouth football.

360
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:37,545
Here we see Mr. Bing--

361
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:40,950
- l thought you got the pictures.
- Just relax, all right?

362
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,821
Nobody knows but us. l´m sure they´re
at the Photo Mat. l´ll get them.

363
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,992
lt takes an hour to develop film.
Come on, man.

364
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:49,629
Mr. Bing, on your feet.

365
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,772
- Turn around and drop trou.
- What?

366
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,142
You heard.
Drop trou, shorts and all.

367
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:01,347
Now, son!

368
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,850
lf you wanna stay a starter
on this team.

369
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,691
You undress like a girl.
Let´s go.

370
00:36:12,563 --> 00:36:14,499
After that half-assed block...

371
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:18,939
l wanted to check to see if maybe you
had a tampon string between your legs.

372
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:22,244
Sit.

373
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,722
All right, girls, come this Friday
it´s gonna be kill or be killed.

374
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,224
Let´s go!

375
00:36:35,797 --> 00:36:39,169
- Yeah, Bing!
- You ready for the game Friday?

376
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:49,684
You´re saying you´ve never seen,
met or talked to Lisa Parker at all ?

377
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,754
No, sir, never.

378
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:54,625
Who´s this you´re hanging on to?

379
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:02,069
Salvation Army alert.
Look who Jess is talking to.

380
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,406
She´s such a bottom-feeder.

381
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,676
You working tonight?

382
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:08,178
No.

383
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,183
You wanna meet me at the diner?

384
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,988
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

385
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:19,328
Cool. See you there.

386
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:25,938
So, what did he want?

387
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,009
He asked me out.

388
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:34,584
- And what´d you say?
- l said, ""Okay. lt´s your funeral.""

389
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,256
Well, okay, pardon me.

390
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,828
But is hanging out with jock-boy
such a hot idea?

391
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:46,034
l just heard that
he´s dating Tracy Campbell, you know.

392
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:48,738
And she--

393
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:52,109
Right now she´s giving you the look
of a thousand deaths.

394
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:00,789
She´s beautiful.

395
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:05,028
Yeah, duh!

396
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:09,368
Coach says l´m starting this week.

397
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,611
What happened in there?

398
00:38:15,677 --> 00:38:18,648
Kelton, with the frickin´ sheriff´s
badge he pulled out of a cereal box.

399
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:22,187
Somebody told him l did Lisa, and
l´m suspended. My dad´s gonna kill me.

400
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:24,791
- What about the game?
- Who cares?

401
00:38:24,858 --> 00:38:28,263
Kelton nailed me with a picture of Lisa
and l, started talking statutory rape.

402
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:30,967
Now l face the D.A. on Thursday.

403
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:33,537
Relax. lt´s bullshit, all right?

404
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:37,810
Your dad´s gonna kick your ass, but he´s
a lawyer, and he´ll kill that shit dead.

405
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:42,617
l´ll miss the game of the year.
Football scouts are gonna be there...

406
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:45,154
and l´m gonna be sitting on the bench
with my thumb up my ass.

407
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:47,658
And that bitch Rachel.

408
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:51,163
You know she´ll be talking all kinds
of shit to anyone who wants to listen.

409
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,066
The best defense is a good offence.

410
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:58,173
- What´s that supposed to mean?
- Get in. We´re gonna do damage control.

411
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:07,220
Get it together. He´s just a guy.

412
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:13,696
You are gonna be late.

413
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:17,335
Boyd?

414
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:23,878
Emilyn?

415
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,120
Forget your keys?

416
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,290
Let´s take the front.

417
00:40:54,544 --> 00:40:56,480
Stop it! Stop!

418
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:58,583
Stop! Stop!

419
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,086
Rachel.

420
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:22,619
- Hello.
- What´s your favorite scary movie?

421
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:25,823
Rachel?

422
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,326
What?

423
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:29,562
Are you naked?

424
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:31,866
Who is this?

425
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:35,604
Or are you wearing
a little red towel?

426
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:43,850
lt´s playtime.

427
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,690
Who the fuck is this?

428
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:52,329
Why don´t l come in and show you,
you fuckin´ dyke?

429
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,836
What do you want?

430
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,413
Who is this?

431
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,984
Don´t you recognize the voice?

432
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:09,788
Who does it sound like?

433
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:16,698
l´m calling the police.

434
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:22,273
Come on out here, Rachel.
You bitch!

435
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,579
- What are you doing?
- Fuck her over like she´s fuckin´ me.

436
00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:29,484
No way.
What the fuck are you doin´?

437
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:35,459
l have an emergency.
l´m at 3366 Broad Street.

438
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:51,683
- lt´s the parents!
- Let´s go. Let´s get out of here.

439
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,696
Yeah, l´m still here.

440
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:07,172
- lf she touches you one more time--
- You never liked her.

441
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,808
Everything´s okay now.

442
00:43:09,776 --> 00:43:11,212
What´s this?

443
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:13,181
Really.

444
00:43:13,248 --> 00:43:15,184
Thanks.

445
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:17,321
Look at the window.

446
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,657
What the hell happened here?

447
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,695
How should l know?

448
00:43:22,762 --> 00:43:25,299
Ah, Jesus!

449
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:40,788
Don´t go tellin´ no stories
about my boy Eric.

450
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:11,200
Why do the innocent always get hit
in a drive-by?

451
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:15,072
What happened to you last night?
l waited up for you.

452
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:22,917
- Why don´t you tell me what happened?
- What are you talking about?

453
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:27,924
l waited in the cafe for over an hour.

454
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:29,927
l´ll tell you what happened.

455
00:44:29,994 --> 00:44:32,598
Okay, what is wrong with this picture?

456
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:34,668
What does he see in her?

457
00:44:34,734 --> 00:44:38,340
Come on, Trace.
You´re caviar, she´s Cheez Whiz.

458
00:44:38,406 --> 00:44:42,813
He´ll come around. He´s letting little
Jesse do the thinking for big Jesse.

459
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,222
l just don´t want
any part of this, okay?

460
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:52,060
Look, let me talk to Mark.
l´ll work this out.

461
00:44:52,127 --> 00:44:54,597
They were probably drunk
and just being stupid.

462
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:56,733
No, don´t.

463
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:01,407
You know what? Maybe all of this
isn´t such a good idea.

464
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:03,543
All of what?

465
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:09,519
Guys like you are supposed to date
girls like Tracy, okay?

466
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:14,459
That´s what this is about?
No. Hold on.

467
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:17,998
Her? Let me take you out
for a date.

468
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:20,001
A nice mellow one.
Tonight.

469
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:24,674
l´m not going anywhere
until you say yes. Go ahead, try me.

470
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:27,345
See?

471
00:45:28,881 --> 00:45:31,317
l mean it.
l´m telling you.

472
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:33,320
Just say yes.

473
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:38,261
What was that?

474
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:39,763
All right.

475
00:45:43,302 --> 00:45:45,672
Yes.

476
00:45:51,213 --> 00:45:54,184
Rachel, l need to talk to you.

477
00:45:58,457 --> 00:45:59,893
We need to talk.

478
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:03,465
- What´s the matter?
- Did you go by Rachel´s?

479
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:07,704
Yeah. We were just sending her
a little message.

480
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:11,042
Give it to me next time.
l´ll make sure she gets it.

481
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:14,414
What are you gettin´ all bent for?
This girl´s just a skank.

482
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,719
- You don´t even know her.
- You do? What do you know about her?

483
00:46:17,786 --> 00:46:20,857
She´s a nice girl. She doesn´t deserve
to be treated like that.

484
00:46:20,924 --> 00:46:23,594
- Who are you to send her a message?
- Who am l?

485
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:27,934
l´m a friend who gives a shit that my
boy´s goin´ down for rape. That´s who.

486
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:30,838
l´m gonna do anything l gotta do
to keep her from fuckin´ talkin´.

487
00:46:30,905 --> 00:46:33,542
Eric´s a big boy. He made his own
decisions. Let him live with them.

488
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:36,013
You got say anything else to say to her,
deal with me.

489
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,082
- Deal with you?
- Deal with me.

490
00:46:38,149 --> 00:46:41,020
No. You´re gonna have to deal with me.

491
00:46:44,692 --> 00:46:47,363
What is wrong with you, Jesse?

492
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:50,701
This is us, man!
We´re all friends here.

493
00:46:51,702 --> 00:46:54,373
No, we just grew up together.

494
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,482
This is just a test that will
let me know how to help you better.

495
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:01,984
You´re wasting your time.

496
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:04,822
Just answer the statements
true or false, okay?

497
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:11,298
""There´s a man inside the television
who tells me what to do.""

498
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:15,203
False?
l don´t see the point.

499
00:47:16,472 --> 00:47:20,244
""Sometimes my thoughts assume the form
of a giant insect.""

500
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,783
- This doesn´t make any sense.
- Answer true or false.

501
00:47:24,784 --> 00:47:27,622
Again. ""Sometimes my thoughts assume
the form of a giant insect.""

502
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:28,990
False.

503
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,195
""lf you want to play the piano well,
you have to practice.""

504
00:47:32,262 --> 00:47:33,664
True.

505
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:37,035
""Large furry animals crawl on my face
every night while l sleep.""

506
00:47:37,102 --> 00:47:38,938
True.

507
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:41,709
l have a dog.

508
00:47:45,748 --> 00:47:48,686
""Sometimes l can move things
with my mind.""

509
00:47:51,891 --> 00:47:54,561
- You can´t make me do this.
- Honey, sit down.

510
00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:56,097
l´m trying to help.

511
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,901
- You´re not my mother, you know.
- l´m trying to be your friend.

512
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:01,271
Let go of me!

513
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,832
They´re all gonna laugh at you!

514
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:41,063
Selling used cars is not what l want.

515
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:44,067
Unless l nail that football scholarship,
that´s what l get.

516
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,873
l can´t believe l´m telling you this.

517
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,779
l never told anybody this before
in my life.

518
00:48:55,918 --> 00:48:59,356
lt must be nice not having to be
like everybody else.

519
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:04,030
lt´s not so great.

520
00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:07,001
l mean...

521
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:11,474
sometimes l wish l could just be
one of the shiny, happy people.

522
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:15,714
Does that surprise you?

523
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,216
Yeah.

524
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:21,589
Everything about you surprises me.

525
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,131
l knew this guy once.
He did this thing.

526
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,237
He could suck a strand of spaghetti...

527
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:57,809
up his mouth
and right out of his nose.

528
00:49:57,876 --> 00:49:59,311
Brain flossing?

529
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,616
He called it a talent.

530
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,690
l bet you´re wondering
where l´m going with this, right?

531
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:11,462
Well--

532
00:50:13,132 --> 00:50:16,470
You really have a talent.
You´ve got football.

533
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:22,145
lt´ll get you out of this place.
After that, you can do what you want.

534
00:50:22,212 --> 00:50:25,683
Make your own path.
Write your own book.

535
00:50:26,484 --> 00:50:29,188
- Think so?
- Word.

536
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:30,991
Word?

537
00:50:31,058 --> 00:50:32,493
Word.

538
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,302
You wanna come with me?

539
00:51:05,408 --> 00:51:06,844
What?

540
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:13,821
Your brake.
lt´s poking me right in the back.

541
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:17,493
You wanna--

542
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:27,107
l really don´t know how to say this.

543
00:51:27,174 --> 00:51:29,143
What?

544
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,645
l´ve never--

545
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,155
Yeah.

546
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:43,064
- And l want it to be special.
- Yeah.

547
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:48,371
Like, you come to my door
with flowers in your hand.

548
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:53,345
Oh, well, okay.

549
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:59,721
What kind of flowers
do you like?

550
00:52:01,724 --> 00:52:03,160
Daisies.

551
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,800
Okay. l´ll have to remember that.

552
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:19,317
l don´t know! l don´t know!

553
00:52:32,937 --> 00:52:37,210
Mrs. Lang, l need to ask you
a few questions about Rachel.

554
00:52:38,812 --> 00:52:40,248
Who is--

555
00:52:41,082 --> 00:52:43,352
Who is her father?

556
00:52:43,419 --> 00:52:45,121
lt isn´t important.

557
00:52:45,188 --> 00:52:48,627
- l knew you´d come back.
- l´m afraid we don´t know each other.

558
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:50,897
We can still get married.
l´ll marry you.

559
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:54,335
- l need to know who he is.
- l´m sorry, that´s private.

560
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,473
The hell with them!
What do they know?

561
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,279
Cut it out! She´s not Terry.
Kindly go away.

562
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:08,957
Poor thing. He´s never had a visitor.
Wants to share everybody else´s.

563
00:53:12,295 --> 00:53:14,665
Mrs. Lang, it´s very important...

564
00:53:14,732 --> 00:53:18,771
that you tell me
who Rachel´s father is.

565
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:21,074
l don´t see how that´s
any of your business.

566
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,077
l´m trying to help Rachel.

567
00:53:23,144 --> 00:53:25,781
She seems troubled,
and l´m very worried about her.

568
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,488
You´re worried?
Are you very worried?

569
00:53:30,555 --> 00:53:31,990
l am, yes.

570
00:53:32,057 --> 00:53:34,995
You don´t have any children,
do you, miss?

571
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:36,998
No, l don´t.

572
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:45,310
Then you don´t know. You will never know
how terrifying children can be.

573
00:53:46,645 --> 00:53:50,217
Mrs. Lang, l know this is
a really strange question...

574
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:52,287
but when Rachel was growing up...

575
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,024
did you ever see objects move
by themselves?

576
00:53:57,027 --> 00:54:00,198
And did the doctors convince you
it was all your imagination?

577
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:02,936
The Lord is with thee.
No. l was crazy then.

578
00:54:03,003 --> 00:54:05,940
l thought she was possessed.
l thought the devil was inside her.

579
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:10,413
Mrs. Lang, Rachel needs help.

580
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,787
She may have a disease,
a genetic disorder.

581
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:17,724
l believe her father
may have passed it on to her.

582
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,395
Disease? Could l have it?
Did l give it to her?

583
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:22,231
- No.
- How do you know?

584
00:54:22,298 --> 00:54:24,367
Because the male is the carrier.

585
00:54:24,434 --> 00:54:27,906
Mrs. Lang, you must tell me his name.

586
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:32,546
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

587
00:54:32,613 --> 00:54:35,083
now and at the hour of our death, amen.

588
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:40,424
l did tell Rachel once
how we met.

589
00:54:42,127 --> 00:54:44,063
He said it was love at first sight.

590
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:48,770
l´ll tell you, but don´t you dare
hurt my daughter.

591
00:54:50,873 --> 00:54:53,911
l never told her ´cause
people around here...

592
00:54:53,977 --> 00:54:56,848
aren´t so fond of Carrie White
´cause of what she did.

593
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:01,155
See, he was her daddy, too.

594
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,860
His name was Ralph.

595
00:55:06,062 --> 00:55:08,499
Ralph White.

596
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:17,479
Rachel?

597
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:21,318
l need you to come with me.

598
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,266
The night of the prom...

599
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:35,572
73 people died.

600
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:40,279
A few of us survived...

601
00:55:40,346 --> 00:55:42,816
but we´ve never talked about that night.

602
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:50,694
That´s why l ended up at Arkham,
if you wondered.

603
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:53,865
l witnessed something
l can´t even begin to tell you about.

604
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,905
But look around.
See for yourself.

605
00:55:57,971 --> 00:56:01,911
This was the original high school.

606
00:56:01,977 --> 00:56:04,281
l wish they´d tear this place down.

607
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:06,951
lt´s like some twisted memorial
to that night.

608
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:12,359
l haven´t been here in over 20 years.

609
00:56:13,594 --> 00:56:15,030
Happy homecoming.

610
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,001
You´ve heard of Carrie White,
haven´t you?

611
00:56:19,036 --> 00:56:21,473
Supposedly she set the fire...

612
00:56:21,539 --> 00:56:26,079
as some type of revenge-suicide thing.

613
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:29,151
Elvis was her date,
and they escaped in a UFO.

614
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,993
l know what happened
to that snow dome on my desk.

615
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,499
lt fell.

616
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:41,502
We both know.

617
00:56:45,975 --> 00:56:49,347
Rachel, is Jesse Ryan pressuring you--

618
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:51,383
Excuse me.
That´s none of your business.

619
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,822
l know everything there is to know
about Carrie White.

620
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,093
She did this.

621
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:03,167
lt began with something like you did
with the snow dome...

622
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:05,170
and then it got out of control.

623
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:08,442
- l´m leaving.
- Rachel.

624
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:14,350
- lt´s a genetic recessive trait.
- What are you saying l have?

625
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:18,523
l´m saying you´re not crazy,
and it´s not the devil.

626
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,795
lt´s a trait you´ve inherited.

627
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:25,567
Telekinesis: the ability
to move objects with your mind.

628
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:29,573
For years, l didn´t believe it existed.

629
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,642
But there are places that study it.

630
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:34,046
There´s a lab at Princeton.
l can take you there.

631
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:36,283
With all respect, lady...

632
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:39,220
you are seriously bat shit.

633
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:41,590
l´m walking back to the real world now.

634
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:44,561
You mother told me your father
is Carrie´s father.

635
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,399
No, my father´s name was Bill Kirk.

636
00:57:47,466 --> 00:57:50,470
- He left when l was three months old.
- lt´s a lie.

637
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:52,273
My mother wouldn´t lie to me.

638
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,509
Believe me, you need help.

639
00:57:54,576 --> 00:57:56,913
Like what?
Like they helped you?

640
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,151
l can help you to get it under control.

641
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:03,422
l don´t want or need your help.

642
00:58:06,126 --> 00:58:09,498
You´re not really thinking
of pressing charges against my son?

643
00:58:09,565 --> 00:58:11,635
Oh, we´re doing more than thinking.

644
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,407
Look, Eric´s a good kid.

645
00:58:15,474 --> 00:58:18,244
He may be guilty
of some youthful transgressions--

646
00:58:18,311 --> 00:58:21,950
Youthful transgressions?
A girl killed herself, Lou.

647
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:24,821
Hello, Jay.

648
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:27,491
Sit. Everybody sit.

649
00:58:27,558 --> 00:58:30,195
l´m just listening in.

650
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:33,634
Okay, then.
Cards on the table.

651
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,806
My boy isn´t going down alone.

652
00:58:37,873 --> 00:58:39,375
Go on.

653
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:48,389
Mark Bing, Jesse Ryan,
Brad Winters and Chuck Potter.

654
00:58:49,457 --> 00:58:52,595
We´re talking about the most prominent
families in this town.

655
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,968
Maybe they´ve all slept
with underage girls. Who can tell?

656
00:58:57,035 --> 00:59:00,106
And, yes, maybe they made
a game of it.

657
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:02,276
And perhaps Eric
can even get proof of that.

658
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:06,649
l agree it would be awful,
but l don´t think it´s criminal.

659
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:11,222
Now, there will be scouts
at the game on Friday.

660
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:14,060
Eric takes a fall,
maybe they all will.

661
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:17,031
You wanna be responsible
for ruining these boys´ lives?

662
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,102
That sums it up.

663
00:59:20,169 --> 00:59:23,473
Karen, what we have here
is an issue with intent.

664
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,743
- Blue-sheet it.
- Oh, but Jay--

665
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:30,050
What you don´t have is evidence enough
to tarnish this boy´s reputation.

666
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:34,556
lt´s not about evidence, is it?
lt´s about elections, right?

667
00:59:34,623 --> 00:59:36,960
That is it, Robbie.
That is all.

668
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:41,433
Lou, thanks for coming by.
l´ll walk you out.

669
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,403
- Appreciate it.
- l know what you´re going through.

670
00:59:43,469 --> 00:59:45,406
- l hope we see you at the game.
- l´ll be there.

671
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:54,920
- Hey, is this seat taken?
- No.

672
00:59:56,989 --> 00:59:59,827
- What´s goin´ on?
- Just studying.

673
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:03,666
You gonna come
to the game Friday?

674
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:09,274
l don´t really do football.

675
01:00:09,341 --> 01:00:12,278
lt´s the season opener.
There´s gonna be some scouts there.

676
01:00:12,345 --> 01:00:14,281
l need you, for luck.

677
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,628
lf he´s gonna do it, you know, be seen
talking in public with someone...

678
01:00:23,695 --> 01:00:25,631
he should show some respect.

679
01:00:25,698 --> 01:00:29,103
l mean, he should show me the respect
at least to be seen with someone pretty.

680
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,106
Someone cool,
someone who counts.

681
01:00:31,173 --> 01:00:33,443
You know, someone.

682
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:38,083
But instead, it´s her.
l just feel totally--

683
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,585
Disrespected.

684
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:41,488
Yeah.

685
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:43,858
Honey, you´re being
seriously dissed.

686
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:48,165
Man, l just wish there was something l
could do to make him come to his senses.

687
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,336
Mark´s got his wheels turning.

688
01:00:51,403 --> 01:00:52,838
What?

689
01:01:06,258 --> 01:01:09,229
Come on. Good lift.

690
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,541
One more. Push it out, man.
Come on, push it.

691
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:20,612
Nice.

692
01:01:27,622 --> 01:01:30,660
Look, man, l´m sorry.
l guess l overreacted.

693
01:01:30,727 --> 01:01:33,598
- Don´t fuck with me.
- l´m not, man.

694
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:38,605
You know, we´ve been friends since
we were both dumpin´ our drawers, dude.

695
01:01:38,672 --> 01:01:41,977
l thought we´d be
best friends forever.

696
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:44,981
Never figured some girl
would come in the way of that.

697
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:51,524
Look, l know l´m scum.
l´m prepared to admit that.

698
01:01:51,591 --> 01:01:56,298
l´m lower than scum.
l´m smegma. l´m butt lint.

699
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:58,668
- Keep going.
- l´m a prick. l´m an asshole.

700
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:01,239
- Asshole, yeah.
- lt´s that good.

701
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,241
l´m sorry, man.

702
01:02:05,712 --> 01:02:08,883
l´m not the one
you should be apologizing to.

703
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:10,385
l know.

704
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,436
Karen, watch my counter, please.

705
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:30,882
Can l help you?

706
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:36,490
Just-- Just looking. Thanks.

707
01:02:51,913 --> 01:02:54,751
Mrs. Porter, this is
a friend of mine from school.

708
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:03,864
l thought she was gonna frisk me.

709
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:06,134
She does step class with my mom.

710
01:03:08,437 --> 01:03:10,707
So, what are you shopping for?

711
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:13,044
Oh, nothing. Just looking.

712
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:15,281
ls it perhaps something
to wear on a date?

713
01:03:15,347 --> 01:03:17,451
Perhaps with a certain
jock hunk we all know?

714
01:03:21,991 --> 01:03:24,060
You know,
Tracy isn´t universally loved.

715
01:03:25,562 --> 01:03:26,864
There´s a shocker.

716
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:30,870
Exhibit A:
She tried to steal Brad from me.

717
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:32,973
She´s a ""Melrose Place"" superbitch.

718
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:39,516
You have got great lips.

719
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:44,857
Really. Look. This shade
will look very kissable and soft.

720
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:46,360
Come here.

721
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:49,898
Trust me, okay?

722
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:51,834
Hold still.

723
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:56,241
So, are you going to the game?
Just blink once for yes.

724
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:01,782
Great, ´cause there´s this big party
afterwards, and l hope you can go.

725
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:05,788
l don´t think so.

726
01:04:05,855 --> 01:04:08,692
Oh, come on. You really should.
l mean, for Jesse.

727
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:12,131
l know it´d mean a lot to him
if we all got along.

728
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:16,871
Yeah. So you´ll go?

729
01:04:18,874 --> 01:04:21,044
Great! See?

730
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:27,286
Can l ring that up for you?

731
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:30,257
Sure. How much is it?

732
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,600
Oh, um, maybe next time.

733
01:04:37,234 --> 01:04:38,670
Thanks, Mrs. Porter.

734
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:45,847
l kleptoed it for you.

735
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,085
Hey, over here!

736
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:52,991
Figured out how to make it up
to you and Rachel.

737
01:04:53,058 --> 01:04:57,230
The summerhouse, bro.
My parents aren´t gonna be there.

738
01:04:57,297 --> 01:05:00,469
l figured you wanted to get away
from us idiots for a little while.

739
01:05:00,535 --> 01:05:03,606
Have a nice, romantic time.
All right?

740
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:07,345
But you´re gonna
bring her by my party.

741
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:10,016
So l can apologize to her,
all right?

742
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:13,955
Then we can all be
one big, happy family again.

743
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:15,958
All right?

744
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:20,331
Have a good time, man.

745
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:48,627
- You look great.
- Thanks.

746
01:06:48,694 --> 01:06:50,764
l really like your hair.

747
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:56,138
Oh, you can just, you know,
throw those in the back or something.

748
01:07:01,747 --> 01:07:05,385
l know Mark can be a jerk sometimes,
but, you know, he´s trying.

749
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:08,190
He´s got a party Friday,
and he invited us.

750
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:10,727
- We won´t go if you don´t want to.
- No, let´s go.

751
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,362
Really?

752
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:35,697
What´s wrong?

753
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:38,868
l´m just a little scared.

754
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:42,674
Don´t be scared.

755
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,214
l know. l just feel
kind of strange.

756
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,960
Look, we don´t
have to do this tonight.

757
01:07:57,128 --> 01:07:59,064
Whenever you´re ready.

758
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,044
God, l must be crazy.

759
01:08:09,379 --> 01:08:14,320
Actually, you´re
about the sanest person l know.

760
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,201
You´re sane.

761
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:11,204
l love you.

762
01:09:36,474 --> 01:09:39,145
You´re grounded, for a week!

763
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:42,450
- But l´ve gotta go to the game--
- You wanna make it two?

764
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:48,191
You stay in this room.
Am l clear?

765
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:52,598
Yes, sir.

766
01:10:14,497 --> 01:10:17,067
Come on! Shave it off!

767
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,484
Hey, you´re next.
Get in the chair.

768
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:30,587
- Come on!
- Come on, bro!

769
01:10:30,654 --> 01:10:32,089
- Come on!
- Come on, man!

770
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:34,359
Oh, you´re gonna ruin
the whole effect, bro!

771
01:10:34,426 --> 01:10:37,530
Oh, Jess, where´s your sac?
Come on!

772
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:04,704
You have to tell her
who her father is.

773
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:08,109
- Why?
- Because she´ll believe it from you.

774
01:11:08,175 --> 01:11:11,480
Rachel needs to seek treatment
before it´s too late.

775
01:11:12,549 --> 01:11:14,485
Too late for what?

776
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:19,359
Rachel´s best friend
committed suicide...

777
01:11:20,827 --> 01:11:22,764
and l´m afraid Rachel may...

778
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:27,637
harm herself or others.

779
01:11:30,508 --> 01:11:34,614
And you want to take me
out there?

780
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:36,384
Yes.

781
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:45,263
He saw me!

782
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:48,101
Go get ´em, baby!

783
01:11:48,168 --> 01:11:50,671
Good afternoon, and welcome
to today´s matchup...

784
01:11:50,738 --> 01:11:53,976
between your Bates Bulldogs
and the Carlin Devils.

785
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,979
This is the first game
for both teams...

786
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:59,084
as the Bulldogs seek
their seventh consecutive championship.

787
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:02,388
However, there is a history
of bad blood between these two teams...

788
01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:05,960
as the Devils have consistently
been a thorn in the Bulldogs´ side.

789
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:09,299
Well, let´s hope the Dawgs can
pull that thorn out once and for all...

790
01:12:09,365 --> 01:12:13,104
as the special teams get set
for the opening kickoff.

791
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:16,309
Number 42 of the Bulldogs,
Chuck Potter, receiving the kick.

792
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:23,152
Oh, my! He´s popped.

793
01:12:24,521 --> 01:12:25,990
Could l have my purse, please?

794
01:12:35,771 --> 01:12:38,041
Just about five minutes to go now
in the second quarter.

795
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:40,211
Go, Jesse!

796
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:44,784
A vicious hit by Stark.
Johnson, number 45, isn´t getting up.

797
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:48,723
- What the hell kind of call was that?
- And it looks like number 33, Stark...

798
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:52,328
is being ejected
for a flagrant personal foul.

799
01:12:52,395 --> 01:12:54,498
What the hell is he fuckin´ doing?

800
01:12:54,565 --> 01:12:58,972
- That was not a flagrant foul!
- Thirty-three has been disqualified.

801
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:01,642
Oh, why don´t l just take
every starter out for you, all right?

802
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,385
Touchdown, Devils!

803
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:12,825
The Bulldogs are trailing in the second
half as they receive the Devils´ punt.

804
01:13:12,892 --> 01:13:16,731
Number 42, Chuck Potter,
takes the kick again for the Dawgs.

805
01:13:16,798 --> 01:13:19,168
And there he goes...

806
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:22,106
cutting across the field,
racing down the sideline!

807
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,887
Fourth quarter action.
Here´s the snap.

808
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:35,759
A quick pass to Jesse Ryan,
and, oooh, he was hit hard.

809
01:13:35,826 --> 01:13:39,364
What a pop.
He is down.

810
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:42,402
He is not getting up
right away.

811
01:13:47,176 --> 01:13:50,447
Wait a minute. l see--
l see movement.

812
01:13:50,514 --> 01:13:54,053
Yes, he´s finally moving now.
He´s up.

813
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,623
Shaking it off.
And there he goes.

814
01:13:58,459 --> 01:14:02,632
Everything´s so different,
so very different.

815
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:05,169
Things change.

816
01:14:05,236 --> 01:14:07,606
There´s Mr. Bellows.
Hello, George!

817
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,211
He always had an eye for me,
that one.

818
01:14:11,278 --> 01:14:14,149
- Where?
- Right there.

819
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,519
Hello, George.

820
01:14:19,356 --> 01:14:21,359
Devils suck!

821
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:23,830
Well, it´s pretty much
do or die time now, folks.

822
01:14:23,896 --> 01:14:27,101
The Dawgs down by four
with only 12 seconds left on the clock.

823
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:29,338
Boy, it´s been a struggle all day
for these Dawgs...

824
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:32,409
trying to move the ball
against the very stingy Devils defense.

825
01:14:32,476 --> 01:14:35,547
l think it´s safe to say this is not how
the Dawgs wanted it to come out today.

826
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:37,283
They´ve had a very tough time
on defense.

827
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:40,654
- They´re not moving the ball as usual.
- Ryan, get up here. Come on.

828
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:44,527
All right, son, trips right,
crazy eight. Let´s go.

829
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:48,366
They´re really taking their time here.
Probably their last play of the game.

830
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:51,804
Trips right, crazy eight.

831
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:55,576
Go, Bulldogs!

832
01:14:58,848 --> 01:15:00,784
Hey, come back here!

833
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:08,829
Last chance. We´ll look for a Hail Mary.
We´ve got Jesse Ryan set wide.

834
01:15:08,896 --> 01:15:11,032
Bulldogs set.
There´s the snap.

835
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,836
Miller drops back.
A long bomb down towards the corner.

836
01:15:13,903 --> 01:15:17,508
Ryan is there. He´s under it.
He jumps. He´s got it!

837
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:20,780
Complete!
Touchdown, Bulldogs!

838
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:23,350
Touchdown!
The Bulldogs win it!

839
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,517
College scout´s here.
He wants to talk to you.

840
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:15,026
Could you tell Rachel to wait for me?
l´m gonna be a few minutes.

841
01:16:15,093 --> 01:16:18,598
No problem.
And, hey, good luck.

842
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:20,100
Thanks.

843
01:16:30,983 --> 01:16:33,420
Jesse´s gonna be a while.
He´s talking with a scout.

844
01:16:33,487 --> 01:16:36,024
- He said to go ahead to the party.
- You hear that, Rachel?

845
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,227
Jesse´s talking to a scout.
lsn´t that great?

846
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:40,931
- Yeah, that´s great.
- All right.

847
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,004
l´m goin´ with the guys.
See you there.

848
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:47,207
Come on.
l´ll give you a ride to Mike´s.

849
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:49,343
- Thanks.
- Deborah!

850
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,153
Dress. Dress time.

851
01:16:57,856 --> 01:17:00,326
- Try this.
- Thanks.

852
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,335
Mascara. Mascara!

853
01:17:06,402 --> 01:17:08,138
Sorry.

854
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:22,425
Done. How do l look?

855
01:17:22,492 --> 01:17:24,061
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

856
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:26,097
- You look good, Monica.
- Thank you. You look pretty, too.

857
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:28,668
- You look really pretty.
- You need lipstick.

858
01:17:29,903 --> 01:17:32,073
Yo, check it out.

859
01:17:39,584 --> 01:17:42,588
Goddamn it!

860
01:17:42,655 --> 01:17:44,691
Whoa, that sucks.

861
01:17:44,758 --> 01:17:46,494
They even slashed my tires.

862
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:50,333
lt´s further proof the Devils
are just a bunch of pigs, huh?

863
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,004
- Are you looking for Rachel?
- Yeah.

864
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:55,441
Well, she´s at Mark´s.
You want a ride over there?

865
01:18:03,452 --> 01:18:06,390
l just have to stop
by my place real quick.

866
01:18:15,136 --> 01:18:17,606
- Tommy, have you seen Rachel Lang?
- Who?

867
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:21,512
- Rachel Lang. Was she at the game?
- Oh, yeah. With the tattoo.

868
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:26,286
l saw her leave with Monica Jones.
l guess they went to Mark Bing´s party.

869
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:29,057
Rachel with Monica?

870
01:18:36,234 --> 01:18:40,073
Just go away!
Todd, get off my butt!

871
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,508
Stop.

872
01:18:44,145 --> 01:18:46,749
Whoa, bro, what are you doing?

873
01:18:46,816 --> 01:18:49,353
You bust something in this house,
heads are seriously gonna roll.

874
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,603
Yes!

875
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:08,047
Rachel, yo.

876
01:19:08,114 --> 01:19:10,317
You could get me
into this party, right?

877
01:19:10,384 --> 01:19:12,754
Hey, Arnie, wait right here.
We´ll come back for you.

878
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:16,059
- See, l told you.
- ln a couple of years.

879
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,429
How come she gets to go in, then?

880
01:19:18,496 --> 01:19:22,335
- She´s one of us.
- l´ll try and get you in, Arnie.

881
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:27,075
Fuck that. Come on, guys,
let´s do some serious doughnuts now.

882
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,512
Come on. Hit it!

883
01:19:31,381 --> 01:19:33,451
So, then the scout said,
and l quote...

884
01:19:33,518 --> 01:19:37,123
""l love your aggressive play.
You have that killer instinct.""

885
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:39,126
That´s great, buddy.
For you, that is great.

886
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:45,235
- There she is. You better disappear.
- No problem.

887
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:52,613
Swank.

888
01:20:02,093 --> 01:20:04,964
Relax. They just need to get to know you
for who you really are.

889
01:20:05,799 --> 01:20:07,668
- How about a drink?
- Right on.

890
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,715
What can l get you beautiful ladies
to drink?

891
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:19,552
Some margaritas would be nice.

892
01:20:21,021 --> 01:20:22,323
- B-Rad.
- Yo!

893
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:24,359
- Margaritas.
- Comin´!

894
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,301
- Thanks.
- l´m glad you could make it.

895
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:32,772
Look, l´m sorry about
the other night at your house.

896
01:20:32,838 --> 01:20:36,611
lt was just a bunch of guys
being guys. l´m sorry.

897
01:20:36,677 --> 01:20:38,947
Jesse told us to cool it
and explain everything.

898
01:20:39,014 --> 01:20:41,718
So, no hard feelings? Peace?

899
01:20:42,419 --> 01:20:45,290
Well, as long as you
pour me a drink, all right.

900
01:20:45,357 --> 01:20:46,725
Sho´.

901
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:50,765
- Thanks.
- To new friends, then?

902
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:55,205
- Drink to that.
- Okay.

903
01:20:59,678 --> 01:21:02,582
Tracy, l appreciate the ride,
but, uh, let´s go.

904
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:05,987
Just a minute.
l´m trying to figure out what to wear.

905
01:21:06,054 --> 01:21:07,489
Of course.

906
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:13,598
Hey, what do you think of this?

907
01:21:14,466 --> 01:21:16,803
- Looks good.
- Really?

908
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:22,044
Well, l don´t know.
l think it might be a bit much.

909
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:24,481
Don´t you?

910
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:29,588
We´re gonna be late.

911
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:33,761
Pretty soon she won´t care
if you´re late.

912
01:21:33,828 --> 01:21:35,330
What´s that?

913
01:21:36,599 --> 01:21:40,137
Well, if she cares about you,
she won´t mind if you´re late.

914
01:21:46,146 --> 01:21:48,283
- Come on, wench, let´s dance.
- Don´t you ""wench"" me.

915
01:21:57,596 --> 01:21:59,532
Come on, Rachel, let´s dance.

916
01:21:59,599 --> 01:22:01,769
l think l´d rather wait for Jesse.

917
01:22:01,836 --> 01:22:04,740
- He´d want you to have fun.
- Come on, have some fun.

918
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:07,711
Yeah, come on, Rach.
l got you, babe. Come on.

919
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:10,048
Go, Rachel!

920
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:42,629
Hey, Mark, l got a little present
for you, right here.

921
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:45,467
Hey, Mark, you like
the game footage, huh?

922
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:48,571
l love the footage.
Yes, l do.

923
01:22:48,638 --> 01:22:50,574
Are you talking about today´s game?

924
01:22:50,641 --> 01:22:52,811
No, l´m talking
about the other game.

925
01:22:52,878 --> 01:22:55,114
What other game?

926
01:22:55,181 --> 01:22:58,920
- The game that you´re in. My turn.
- Yeah?

927
01:22:58,986 --> 01:23:02,625
- The game that you played, Rachel.
- That´s right. What was the score?

928
01:23:02,692 --> 01:23:05,095
Chuckie, grab that score book.
l wanna see it.

929
01:23:05,162 --> 01:23:08,567
- Want to see it now? All right.
- Come here, baby.

930
01:23:08,634 --> 01:23:11,471
l wanna show you how you helped
Jesse win the game.

931
01:23:13,074 --> 01:23:15,244
Two-twenty-four!
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

932
01:23:24,424 --> 01:23:26,360
Rachel, catch!

933
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:31,601
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

934
01:23:32,302 --> 01:23:34,672
Hold it!
l gotta get my camera for this.

935
01:23:34,739 --> 01:23:36,976
- Read off the scores.
- Whoa. Hold on.

936
01:23:38,244 --> 01:23:41,315
Come on, Rachel. Give it to us.
Read the scores!

937
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:43,652
Come on. Please.
Let´s start with Eric´s scores...

938
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,223
´cause it´s gonna be so sad.

939
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,359
Start with poor Eric.

940
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:54,368
What´s the matter, Rach? ls there
someone there that you recognize?

941
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,838
Someone you know? Huh?

942
01:24:05,785 --> 01:24:08,956
Lisa. Forgot about Lisa.

943
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,095
Come on down!

944
01:24:13,162 --> 01:24:15,866
That´s our brother!
The D.A. kissed his butt!

945
01:24:20,606 --> 01:24:22,709
- We were just talking about Lisa.
- Oh, Lisa.

946
01:24:23,844 --> 01:24:25,247
How was she?

947
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:28,117
Well, to be honest,
l just about split her in two.

948
01:24:36,496 --> 01:24:39,167
- How many points was she?
- She was worth four points.

949
01:24:39,234 --> 01:24:41,637
But l think we should deduct those
since she offed herself.

950
01:24:41,704 --> 01:24:45,810
Wait. Think of how many points he´d have
got if he´d done her after she was dead.

951
01:24:46,845 --> 01:24:48,948
- A bit cold, huh?
- Chuck, come on!

952
01:24:49,015 --> 01:24:52,754
Rach, baby, read that.
Open it up to Jesse´s page.

953
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:55,658
l want you to see
how many points...

954
01:24:55,725 --> 01:24:58,061
Jesse got for you.

955
01:24:58,128 --> 01:25:01,099
Oh, well, l think that´ll be
about a two-four-six-eight!

956
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,236
Who do we appreciate?

957
01:25:03,302 --> 01:25:06,240
More than that, ´cause remember,
Rach, you said you were a dyke...

958
01:25:06,307 --> 01:25:08,310
so he got extra points
for the conversion.

959
01:25:08,377 --> 01:25:11,548
Oh, the conversion!
Two points!

960
01:25:11,615 --> 01:25:13,584
Not two. Thirty!

961
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:16,489
Thirty!
You gave her thirty?

962
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,626
She should get extra points,
being that she´s so skanky.

963
01:25:27,605 --> 01:25:29,942
Look at that.
Look at it.

964
01:25:35,383 --> 01:25:37,319
See, we didn´t think
Jesse could do it.

965
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,459
- So he offered to get us proof.
- How do you like Jesse´s big play?

966
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:44,029
Lookie, lookie here, Rachel.

967
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:49,470
- They´re all gonna laugh at you!
- Was it good for you?

968
01:25:51,607 --> 01:25:54,177
ls that you?

969
01:25:57,248 --> 01:25:58,517
They´re all gonna laugh at you!

970
01:25:58,584 --> 01:26:01,321
Oh, come on, Rachel!
Was it good, Rachel?

971
01:26:17,945 --> 01:26:19,948
Sucker!

972
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:30,197
Hey, is that a zit on your ass?

973
01:26:30,264 --> 01:26:33,101
lt is! lt is a zit on her ass!

974
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:35,738
No, that´s a mole.

975
01:26:35,805 --> 01:26:37,374
Holy shit.

976
01:26:37,441 --> 01:26:39,077
What?

977
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:43,717
- Mark, what´s going on?
- l have no idea.

978
01:27:24,343 --> 01:27:25,478
Out of my way!

979
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:28,215
Brad, you bastard!

980
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:10,110
- Get out of the way! Move it!
- Shit! lt won´t open!

981
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:15,184
Holy shit, dude!

982
01:28:15,752 --> 01:28:16,687
Go!

983

Somebody put me out! Help!

984
01:28:34,446 --> 01:28:37,551
Oh, God, help me!

985
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:41,323
Oh, my God!

Let me out!

987
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,770
Man, we´re missing
one killer party.

988
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:57,079
- Where are the fuckin´ keys?
- Hurry!

989
01:28:57,146 --> 01:29:00,351
My stupid dad.
He´s always hiding these friggin´ keys!

990
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:03,689
Hurry up! Come on!

991
01:29:07,394 --> 01:29:09,965
Tyler! Tyler, get up!

992
01:29:10,032 --> 01:29:11,968
- What the hell´s this?
- lt´s a spear gun, idiot.

993
01:29:12,035 --> 01:29:14,238
- Give me that shit.
- Hey, man, forget the flare gun.

994
01:29:14,305 --> 01:29:15,874
What are you gonna do
with a flare gun?

995
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:28,893
lt´s all my fault.

996
01:29:42,813 --> 01:29:45,150
Let´s go! Get outta here!
Oh, shit!

997

Go on! Through the glass!

Get up!

999
01:30:04,245 --> 01:30:07,049
- Pull the cord!

1000
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:33,755
Oh, shit.

1001
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,677
Momma?

1002
01:32:58,467 --> 01:33:00,570
What´s wrong?

1003
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:12,989
What are you?
You´re not my little girl.

1004
01:33:15,626 --> 01:33:18,730
The devil´s in you!

1005
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:22,736
Momma, please!

1006

Momma, don´t leave me!
Don´t leave me!

Come on. She´s dead.
They´re all dead.
