1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,667
To my family, I am the brother and son

2
00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:16,688
who just returned home after
being lost at sea 5 years ago.

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,857
They don't know I came back with a mission,

4
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,509
to bring justice to our city,

5
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:26,531
and they never can.

6
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:30,736
The men and women I've
targeted are dangerous, corrupt,

7
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,122
a virulent cancer.

8
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:39,745
Cancers like James Holder,

9
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:43,131
whose corporation put
defective smoke detectors

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,635
in low-income housing in The Glades.

11
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:51,506
There have been many fires
and too many funerals.

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,349
But cancers can be fought and conquered.

13
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,052
All it takes is a surgeon...

14
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,821
and the right instrument.

15
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,028
Heh.

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,997
Other than the bill I got handed

17
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:16,381
this morning by my legal team,

18
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:17,749
I'm feeling pretty good.

19
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,751
Plus, now that this lawsuit's been settled,

20
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,570
we can focus our attention
on Unidac Industries.

21
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:25,340
Ok.

22
00:01:25,342 --> 00:01:27,509
I'll see you in the office first thing.

23
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,529
I have armed security inside.

24
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,114
All I have to do is call out.

25
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,582
Go ahead.

26
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,250
They can't hear you.

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,288
What the hell do you want?

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,457
How many people died in those fires?

29
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,959
How many?!

30
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,148
The courts say you don't
owe your victims anything.

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,350
I disagree.

32
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,418
James Holder... 

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,852
You...

34
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,647
It's no surprise a man
as corrupt as James Holder

35
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,367
has more than one enemy.

36
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,702
The bullet. Poison.

37
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,225
Ahh.

38
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:50,479
Who are you?

39
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,785
Why did you shoot me?

40
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,309
Aah!

41
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,704
What happened? Thea ok?

42
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,406
The cops brought her home.

43
00:04:46,408 --> 00:04:48,341
Her and some of her
friends broke into a store,

44
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:50,627
tried on some dresses last night.

45
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,048
Lit up the breathalyzer
like a Christmas tree.

46
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,350
So how was your evening, sir?

47
00:04:57,352 --> 00:04:59,019
You mean after I said I
had to go to the bathroom

48
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,770
at dinner and never came back?

49
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:05,041
I guess from now on
I'll be watching you pee.

50
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:11,648
Thank you, officers. My
wife and I appreciate it.

51
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,116
I'll see you out.

52
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,656
Last time it was public intoxication.

53
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:21,157
This time breaking and entering.

54
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,993
My, how we are moving
up in the criminal world.

55
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:26,413
You know, when you pay off the store owner,

56
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,197
you should check out the merchandise.

57
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,083
They got some pretty killer outfits.

58
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,085
Thea, go get ready for school.

59
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:36,322
Uh, you know, I was thinking
of taking a sick day.

60
00:05:36,324 --> 00:05:40,877
Fine, then get some sleep.

61
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,850
You look like crap.

62
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:50,153
You're letting her play hooky?

63
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,855
When your sister gets like this,

64
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:53,273
it's best to give her her space.

65
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:54,858
She's testing you.

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,077
Yes. Who'd she learn that from?

67
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,364
Mom.

68
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:04,334
When I was her age, you and
dad let me get away with murder.

69
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,753
Looking back, I could have used less space

70
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,738
and more parenting.

71
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,681
It doesn't make sense.

72
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:20,917
Holder fits the profile. Wealthy dirtbag.

73
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,735
Red meat for the hood.

74
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,137
And we recovered at least one arrow.

75
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:25,922
Yeah, only this time the cause of death

76
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:27,307
is a double tap through the heart

77
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,225
and our perp doesn't use firearms.

78
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,161
Maybe he's finally figured
out there's easier ways

79
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:33,396
to kill people than with a bow and arrow.

80
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:37,133
It's like you said, the guy's a whackjob.

81
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:58,922
The bullets were laced with curare,

82
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,307
a rare and deadly poison,

83
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:05,628
the killer's unique M.O.

84
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,230
He's killed all over the world...

85
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:10,400
Chicago, Markovia, Corto Maltese.

86
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,886
Interpol even has a codename for him...

87
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,938
Deadshot.

88
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:18,575
I was prepared to give
James Holder a chance

89
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:22,311
to right his wrongs, but
this Deadshot has no morality,

90
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:25,915
no honor, no code.

91
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:27,784
He doesn't kill for justice,

92
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:31,037
which makes him as dangerous
as anyone on my list.

93
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,426
In fact, it puts him right at the top.

94
00:07:48,754 --> 00:07:50,388
So what do you think?

95
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,789
Great spot for a nightclub or what?

96
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,342
Sweet. Though I got to tell you, man,

97
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:55,844
if you're thinking about calling it Queens,

98
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:57,428
I don't think you're
gonna get the clientele

99
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,479
that you were hoping for.

100
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:00,014
Private office.

101
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,466
For the private one-on-one
meetings, I would imagine.

102
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:04,769
Hopefully the occasional
two-on-one meeting.

103
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,806
Man, are you sure you want to do this?

104
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:11,242
It's not like you really
have any experience

105
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:15,547
in running a... well, running anything.

106
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:18,082
How about tomorrow night the two of us,

107
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,334
we go and scope out the competition.

108
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,236
There's a new club opening downtown.

109
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,538
It's called Poison. Max Fuller owns it.

110
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,406
- Max Fuller?
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,108
I slept with his fiancée.

112
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,259
Yeah, before the wedding.

113
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,794
It was at the rehearsal dinner.

114
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,263
The rehearsal dinner is
technically before the wedding.

115
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,631
Right?

116
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,050
And besides, who stays mad at a castaway?

117
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:38,636
Ah, dammit, I got to roll.

118
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,004
Anyway, I'll see you later, man.

119
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,172
Good place.

120
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:42,941
See you.

121
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,647
So... what do you think?

122
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,816
Well, I'm here to provide
security, sir, not a commentary.

123
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,651
Oh, come on, dig, do me a favor.

124
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:57,572
Speak freely, please.

125
00:08:57,574 --> 00:09:00,358
Well, this is The Glades, right?

126
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,328
Your rich white friends wouldn't
come to this neighborhood on a bet.

127
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,380
I am Oliver Queen, right?

128
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:09,167
People would stand in line
for 3 hours if I opened a club.

129
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:10,868
And no one who actually lives in The Glades

130
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,470
would see a penny of those cover charges.

131
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:13,955
So we make it a successful business,

132
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,974
we gentrify the neighborhood.

133
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:19,477
I was wondering when we would get to that.

134
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:23,264
The white knight swooping in
to save the disenfranchised.

135
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:26,734
And all by his lonesome
with no help from anybody.

136
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:28,353
Wow.

137
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,555
You don't think very much of me, do you?

138
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:33,408
No, sir, actually, I
have a very high regard

139
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,893
for how perceptive you are.

140
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,830
Sir.

141
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,955
The nightclub will
conceal my base underneath

142
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,875
and provide an alibi for where
Oliver Queen spends his nights.

143
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,025
Hey.

144
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,694
Do you have the depos on the Jergens case?

145
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:06,213
Yeah, they're around here somewhere.

146
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:11,368
I was just surfing the 'net.

147
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,304
Really?

148
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:15,306
Joanna, I'm over him. 

149
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,558
And you don't believe me.

150
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,094
Well, I would have if I
wouldn't have just caught you

151
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,646
trolling for articles on him!

152
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,631
I wasn't trolling! I don't want to have

153
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,634
to be the one to remind you
that he cheated on you, Laurel.

154
00:10:26,636 --> 00:10:28,402
With your sister.

155
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:31,239
I appreciate your self control.

156
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,441
You're stuck in the past.
And the reason I know this

157
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:35,776
is the fact that the
only physical relationship

158
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:38,579
you've had since Oliver
is with his best friend.

159
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,615
It is time to move on.

160
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:43,034
It is past time.

161
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,619
I've been busy.

162
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,087
I work a lot.

163
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,821
Ok.

164
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:48,873
That's got to stop.

165
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,591
So we are going out tonight.

166
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,627
And... and we are going to have some shots

167
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,095
and we are going to dance
with men that we don't know

168
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,264
and we are going to stay out way too late.

169
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:58,766
Oh! 

170
00:10:58,768 --> 00:11:01,418
Jergens depos.

171
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,388
I really don't think I can go out tonight.

172
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,026
It is adorable that you actually
think I'm giving you a choice.

173
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:18,257
I want you to come home right after school.

174
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,175
Oh, can't. Margot and I
are going to go to the mall.

175
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,978
What, more shopping? 

176
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,513
Tell Margot you'll have to cancel.

177
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,848
You're grounded for two weeks.

178
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,050
Grounded?

179
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,003
I've never been grounded.

180
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:34,355
Well, you've never
committed larceny before.

181
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:37,525
Since when do you care?

182
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,777
I've always cared. I'm your mother.

183
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,030
Look, we've had a good thing
going on the last five years.

184
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:44,198
Why mess with that now?

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,750
No, we are paying off store owners

186
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:47,234
to keep your record clean,

187
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:48,502
so clearly, it hasn't been working.

188
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,755
And you're going to teach me.

189
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,341
It's Oliver, isn't it?

190
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:56,410
His judgmental hypocrisy
is rubbing off on you.

191
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,246
No, I don't need Oliver to
teach me how to parent you.

192
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:00,765
You'll be home by 4:00.

193
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,717
Or what?

194
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,885
You're going to call the cops on me?

195
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:08,022
Tell them I say hi.

196
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:19,010
Got ballistics back on the Holder murder.

197
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:22,763
They pulled two 7.62
millimeter bullets out of him.

198
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,565
According to the stippling
and size of the entry wound,

199
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,067
they estimate the shots were fired

200
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:27,968
from approximately a hundred yards away.

201
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,604
A hundred yards?

202
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:32,440
What, so the hood shoots
him from another building,

203
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,691
goes over to his place,
he takes out his security,

204
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,977
and then he fires off a few arrows?

205
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,562
And according to his tox screen,

206
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:39,146
his blood contained high concentrations

207
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:40,948
of strychnos toxifera.

208
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,416
- What?
- Curare.

209
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:43,534
It's a kind of poison.

210
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:45,453
Oh. Ok, so now we switch from arrows

211
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,205
to sniper bullets and poison.

212
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:49,323
I'm not buying it.

213
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,992
We still found arrows on the scene.

214
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,261
Solid evidence the hood was there.

215
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,680
Where you going?

216
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:58,666
I'm going to get my own evidence.

217
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:14,115
7.62 millimeter rounds.

218
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:16,801
The money trail leads back to the Bratva...

219
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,603
the Russian mob.

220
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:22,206
Finally... some good luck.

221
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,618
Pleased to meet you.

222
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:54,291
I apologize.

223
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:56,627
We meant no disrespect

224
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,730
to a captain.

225
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:03,601
Particularly an American one.

226
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,105
So...

227
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,658
How can I be of assistance?

228
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,611
I'm in the market for a hired gun.

229
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:14,629
Someone the organization's used before.

230
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:18,666
His calling card is a 7.62
millimeter gun laced with curare.

231
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:21,052
I know no man who uses such tools.

232
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:23,304
But you can find out who does.

233
00:16:23,306 --> 00:16:26,390
First, we will drink
to each other's health,

234
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:30,228
then I will look into the
identity of this man you seek.

235
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,098
Ahh.

236
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,135
I will also confirm that you
are really Bratva captain.

237
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,137
Should this not be the case,

238
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,773
I will send my mechanic here

239
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,643
to find you and kill you and your family.

240
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,703
Carl Rasmussen was found

241
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,222
shot to death in his
home earlier this evening.

242
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,224
The police will not comment
if there's a connection

243
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,676
between Mr. Rasmussen's death

244
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:02,045
and the murder of James
Holder a few nights ago.

245
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,732
Mr. Rasmussen leaves behind
a wife and three children.

246
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:26,887
It's a great loss.

247
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,422
Carl was a titan.

248
00:17:28,424 --> 00:17:31,642
A titan who was looking
to buy out a company called

249
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,010
Unidac Industries?

250
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,262
Well, industries are
something of a misnomer.

251
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:39,567
UI's recent activity was actually
looking into alternative energy.

252
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:41,268
I think the point my
partner is trying to make

253
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,920
is that Carl Rasmussen was

254
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,072
the second bidder this
week to lose his life.

255
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,108
Are you implying something, Detective?

256
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,410
Well, only that your husband's
looking into buying Unidac Industries

257
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:52,163
and the competition seems
to be dropping like flies.

258
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:54,698
And I'm sure your veiled accusation

259
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,701
has nothing to do with how
you feel about my family?

260
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:00,588
Unidac's in receivership, Detective.

261
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,256
Ownership is subject

262
00:18:02,258 --> 00:18:04,375
to a liquidation auction,
so that means there are

263
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,127
many prospective buyers.

264
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,579
And the auction's tomorrow, so... 

265
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,082
if I was taking out the competition,

266
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:14,118
I have a lot of killing to do
in a very short amount of time.

267
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,638
We're just making the rounds
with the interested buyers.

268
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,373
Let them know to be careful.

269
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,525
Oh, yes. And I'm overwhelmed

270
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:25,229
that Detective Lance is
concerned for our safety.

271
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,481
Well...

272
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,099
Thank you for your concern, gentlemen.

273
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:32,286
Our security consultant, Mr. Diggle,

274
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:35,239
is taking all the necessary precautions.

275
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,857
Yeah.

276
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:39,226
Right.

277
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,945
Well, if you need us,

278
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:45,399
we're just a 911 call away.

279
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,341
Ha ha ha!

280
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,510
Oh, my, this is going to be killer.

281
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,463
If Max never sees me here... I agree.

282
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:02,266
Ah, if you want to run a business,
you've got to take a few risks.

283
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,101
I don't see your name on the list.

284
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,102
Mr. Queen.

285
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh!

286
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,442
I have never seen this
guy before in my life.

287
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,977
Ever.

288
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:15,946
Oh, come on, he's good.

289
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:29,993
Oh, wow!

290
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:33,380
Doesn't you going out and having
fun violate some kind of law,

291
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:36,133
you know, like the ones that
are carved on a stone tablet?

292
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,718
- That's cute, Tommy.
- Thanks.

293
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,337
I can see you two are up to
your old hunting patterns.

294
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,140
Just seeing what passes for fun
in starling city after five years.

295
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:45,509
Ah.

296
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,611
Well, I'm sure you'll find that it
just hasn't been the same without you.

297
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:49,730
Big brother!

298
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,399
Oh! I am so wasted right now.

299
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,736
There is... there is two of you.

300
00:19:55,738 --> 00:19:58,372
I thought you were grounded.

301
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:02,459
I am. And thank you... thank
you for that, by the way.

302
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,663
You're done for the night.

303
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,364
Oh, what are you going to do?

304
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:10,134
- Tell mom?
- Thea!

305
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:13,587
You are hanging with the wrong people.

306
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,673
You're one to talk.

307
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:19,710
How much do you know about your
own so-called friends over here?

308
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:22,179
Oh, Thea, maybe you should...

309
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:25,683
Tommy... I think your
BFF has a right to know.

310
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,151
Thea, let's go.

311
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:29,136
Well, I guess they never told you

312
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,189
that they've been screwing
while you were gone.

313
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,615
Look, man, I...

314
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,667
Tommy...

315
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,953
It's ok.

316
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:51,959
You and me, we're done for the night.

317
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,545
Take your hands off of me.

318
00:20:54,547 --> 00:20:57,748
You're not my father.

319
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,217
And you're barely my brother.

320
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,119
Well...

321
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:07,954
look at this.

322
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,373
Oliver Queen.

323
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,576
Max Fuller.

324
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,912
How you been?

325
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:18,298
Happy you drowned.

326
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:23,136
Hey, Max...

327
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:28,558
Get him up!

328
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,809
Hey, let him go, let him go!

329
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:32,312
Hey, I said let him go!

330
00:21:32,314 --> 00:21:35,381
Told you he was going to be pissed.

331
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:36,816
Back off, Merlyn. This isn't your problem.

332
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,101
You want to get to him?

333
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:40,570
You've got to go through me.

334
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:43,156
Wow, they are probably
going to get through me.

335
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,954
So is this over, Max?

336
00:21:57,956 --> 00:22:00,673
Or are you going to have
your boys pound on me next?

337
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:06,596
You three consider
yourselves banned for life.

338
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:09,632
Get the hell out of my place!

339
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,552
Your club sucks anyway.

340
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:14,137
You guys ok?

341
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:16,522
Where'd you learn to do
that? Cop dad, remember?

342
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:19,058
He made me take self defense classes.

343
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,894
Laurel.

344
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:25,481
Thea said...

345
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,867
Oliver, Tommy and I
don't need your blessing.

346
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,122
And I don't need your forgiveness.

347
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:34,958
Ah.

348
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:02,253
Why don't you guys take a seat,

349
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,505
and I will grab a couple of burgers

350
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:05,906
and some ice for those faces.

351
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:07,407
The girl's pretty cute.

352
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,626
That's my sister in law.

353
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:11,078
Who I will never speak to or... look at.

354
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,263
Ever. Gonna grab a booth.

355
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:15,599
She's not wearing a wedding ring.

356
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,686
Brother out of the picture?

357
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,105
Yeah, you could say that.

358
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,458
Hey you.

359
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,510
So sweet of you to adopt two white boys.

360
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,078
They need a good role model.

361
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,380
That's my client Oliver Queen.

362
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:37,267
Looks like you're doing a
bang up job protecting him.

363
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,603
Mmm.

364
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,171
Look, man...

365
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:44,258
about Laurel.

366
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,726
I was going to tell you.

367
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:49,730
I was just trying to
figure out the right way.

368
00:24:49,732 --> 00:24:51,482
To tell somebody that you
slept with their girlfriend

369
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:55,619
after they went missing
and were then presumed dead.

370
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,912
What, there's no greeting card for that?

371
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:03,066
Look...

372
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,601
it was wrong.

373
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,820
- And I'm sorry...
- Tommy.

374
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:11,358
I was dead.

375
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,794
No, man, you were with Laurel.

376
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:16,446
And whether you were
dead, or as it turns out,

377
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,282
alive on a deserted island,

378
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:21,018
you are my friend.

379
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,637
And me being with Laurel
violated that friendship

380
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,505
in about 50 different ways.

381
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:27,457
Thank you.

382
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,509
But it's ok.

383
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,713
How dangerous is this gig, anyway?

384
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:34,965
It's a cakewalk, Carla, don't worry.

385
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,333
Too late.

386
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,885
Or have you forgotten this job

387
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:41,438
got your brother killed?

388
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Because, Dig, I haven't.

389
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,943
I can't.

390
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,448
You are being really chill about this. I...

391
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,703
Hello?

392
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,727
It's a Russian model calling me.

393
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,914
Can we... can I have a minute, please?

394
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:10,133
I can see now why you
were able to be so chill.

395
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:12,786
Enjoy.

396
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,805
So I checked out?

397
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:18,675
You did. His name is Floyd Lawton.

398
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:22,512
I have address. Where he stayed
last time, he was in starling city.

399
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,164
But that is all.

400
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,399
Let's hope he's a creature of habit. Go.

401
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:31,021
1700 Broadway, Papp Motel, room 52.

402
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,690
You'll leave us out of this, yes?

403
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:37,244
Assuming Mr. Lawton doesn't kill you first.

404
00:27:51,152 --> 00:27:53,770
Ahem.

405
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,406
Felicity smoke?

406
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,492
Hi. I'm Oliver Queen.

407
00:27:58,494 --> 00:28:01,078
Of course.

408
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,030
I know who you are, you're Mr. Queen.

409
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:04,948
No, Mr. Queen was my father.

410
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,134
Right, but he's dead. I mean, he drowned.

411
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:10,537
But you didn't, which means you
could come down to the I.T. department

412
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,323
and listen to me babble.

413
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,342
Which will end.

414
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:18,195
In 3... 2... 1.

415
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,963
I'm having some trouble with my computer

416
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,683
and they told me that you were
the person to come and see.

417
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,937
I was at my coffee shop surfing the web

418
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,605
and I spilt a latte on it.

419
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,973
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,392
'Cause these look like bullet holes.

421
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,811
My coffee shop is in a bad neighborhood.

422
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:40,367
If there is anything that
you can salvage from it,

423
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:44,204
I would really appreciate it.

424
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,623
Mm-hmm.

425
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:58,135
Oh. Well, good, you're here.

426
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm under house arrest, remember.

427
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:03,473
Do you want to wear the
Calvin Klein or the Zac Posen?

428
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,976
For dinner?

429
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,545
I was just going to wear pajamas.

430
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,148
To Walter's stock auction.

431
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,016
I think I rather be grounded.

432
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,835
No, it's important that you come.

433
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,436
Important to whom?

434
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:19,172
To me.

435
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,581
All right, listen to me.

436
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:32,902
When you were four years old,

437
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,955
you came home one day with a cat.

438
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:38,125
It was a stray, it was filthy,

439
00:29:38,127 --> 00:29:39,409
and it was mean.

440
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,178
But you stood there and you declared

441
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,963
that it was coming to live with us.

442
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,649
Your father came home from the office

443
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,417
and he saw what was going on,

444
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,270
and he sat you down and he explained to you

445
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:53,190
that the cat was in fact a tiger

446
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,709
and that we needed to get it home.

447
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,395
And somehow...

448
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,097
you understood.

449
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,451
Robert was always so good
at getting through to you.

450
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:07,037
I... I was always so jealous of that.

451
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,873
I... 

452
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:16,146
You never talk about him.

453
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,999
Dad.

454
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:24,054
That's the first time you've
talked about him in years.

455
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:30,377
Well, I think you and I have
gotten into some bad habits.

456
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,296
There's been a lot that
has changed recently, Thea,

457
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,066
and I think that maybe
this can change, too.

458
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:53,917
It looks like blueprints.

459
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,535
Do you know what of?

460
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:58,622
- The exchange building.
- Never heard of it.

461
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,591
It's where the Unidac industry's
auction is scheduled to take place.

462
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,212
I thought you said that was your laptop.

463
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,713
Yes.

464
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:09,015
Look, I don't want to get in the middle

465
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,952
of some Shakespearian family drama thing.

466
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,486
What?

467
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,388
Mr. Steele marrying your mom.

468
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,774
Claudius, Gertrude...

469
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,842
Hamlet?

470
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,611
I didn't study Shakespeare
at any of the four schools

471
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,846
that I dropped out of.

472
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,150
Mr. Steele is trying to
buy Unidac Industries.

473
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,619
And you've got a company laptop

474
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,355
associated with one of the
guys he's competing against.

475
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:35,292
- Floyd Lawton.
- No.

476
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,527
Warren Patel.

477
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,146
Who's Floyd Lawton?

478
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:45,335
He is an employee of Mr. Patel, evidently.

479
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,389
The exchange building

480
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,874
is surrounded by 3 towers with
eye lines into the building.

481
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,293
Lawton could get a kill shot off

482
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:55,729
from virtually anywhere.

483
00:31:55,731 --> 00:32:00,350
But I can't cover the area.

484
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,319
I can't protect all of Deadshot's targets.

485
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,689
I can't do this alone.

486
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,970
Ah, you son of a bitch! Detective, quiet!

487
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:16,523
You've got a pair on you, pulling
this right outside the police station!

488
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:18,025
Floyd Lawton's the one targeting the buyers

489
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:19,609
interested in Unidac Industries.

490
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:22,913
Interpol calls him "Deadshot"
because he never misses.

491
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:26,033
You can look this up after I go.

492
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,335
Yeah, and stop chasing you, I suppose?

493
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:30,504
Warren Patel hired Lawton.

494
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:32,205
I can't be sure who they're targeting,

495
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:33,707
it might be all the buyers,

496
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,343
and I can't protect
them in a space that big.

497
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:38,595
I need your help.

498
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:39,963
Yeah?

499
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,515
Professional help.

500
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:44,267
Lawton laces his bullets with curare.

501
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:46,553
Tell your men to wear kevlar.

502
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:49,056
I'll them to shoot you...

503
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:13,076
Well, it's quite a turn out, huh?

504
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,362
Well, it's quite an opportunity, actually.

505
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:18,782
But regardless of the
outcome of the auction,

506
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:21,284
I'm already a winner because I
have the two most beautiful women

507
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:22,502
- at my side tonight.
- Two?

508
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:24,287
Mm-hmm.

509
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,494
Thanks for coming, Thea.

510
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:34,264
It means a lot to your mother. And me.

511
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:38,618
Mr. Steele, the auction

512
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,603
will be opening in 5 minutes.

513
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:41,972
Please make sure your bid is ready.

514
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:42,973
- Thank you, Gina.
- Mm-hmm.

515
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:45,642
- Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:50,864
Warren Patel. I'm going to
need you to come with me, sir.

517
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,985
Unit one, all clear. Unit two, you copy?

518
00:33:54,987 --> 00:33:58,321
We have Patel in custody.
Still, no sign of Lawton.

519
00:33:57,973 --> 00:33:59,523
Unit three?

520
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:01,286
I'm at the northwest perimeter. All clear.

521
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,754
Unit four?

522
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:03,955
Parking structure is clear.

523
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:05,089
Unit five, what's your status?

524
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:08,259
This is unit five. All clear.

525
00:34:15,673 --> 00:34:18,859
Oh, what a shock.

526
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:22,045
It is Friday night.

527
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:23,680
What are you doing here?

528
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:26,182
Well, I am an attorney
and this is a courthouse,

529
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:30,020
so I think the better question
is, what are you doing here?

530
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:32,772
I wanted to talk to you about last night.

531
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,891
You mean how I saved your asses?

532
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,276
You're welcome.

533
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:39,029
Ok, first of all, we shall never,

534
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:40,780
ever speak of that ever again.

535
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:44,417
And secondly, I think you know
that I meant the other thing.

536
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:46,419
I don't care to talk about that.

537
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:48,237
I spoke to Oliver.

538
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,258
He was surprisingly cool.

539
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:55,929
That's because he knew.

540
00:34:57,064 --> 00:34:59,749
Did you see his face when Thea told him?

541
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,435
Tommy, he didn't even blink.

542
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:04,521
Trust me, he knew.

543
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,306
Then why didn't he say anything?

544
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:08,091
I don't know.

545
00:35:08,093 --> 00:35:11,094
Maybe because he knows he doesn't
have any right to judge me.

546
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:15,065
There's a silver lining, though.

547
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,766
Now that the whole truth

548
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:18,535
and nothing but is out,

549
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:21,571
is there a chance now for you and me?

550
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:28,878
You said you didn't think

551
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,631
that I was a one girl type of guy.

552
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,716
I'm going to prove you wrong.

553
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:36,619
By dating me.

554
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:37,937
By being better.

555
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,740
By being someone that you deserve

556
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,976
and that you want to be with.

557
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:45,395
Well...

558
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:49,666
that's certainly a guy I'd
be interested in meeting.

559
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,785
Good.

560
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:54,104
Now how about we start, ahem,

561
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,772
by getting you the heck out of here.

562
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:57,273
Come on, it is Friday night.

563
00:35:57,275 --> 00:35:58,808
Come on.

564
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,476
Fine. Good.

565
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,833
Well, don't you scrub up nice?

566
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:08,317
Here to support my family.

567
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:10,336
Yeah, me, too, God help me.

568
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,338
Thank you.

569
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:20,847
Dig. Got your eyes open?

570
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,465
That's what I'm here for, sir.

571
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:24,184
That and answering patronizing questions.

572
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,802
This guy's out of time.

573
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:27,336
If he's going to do something,

574
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:29,139
it's going to happen before the auction.

575
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,391
Sir?

576
00:36:31,393 --> 00:36:34,677
I heard the story on the radio.

577
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,779
Oliver.

578
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:38,731
So pleased you were able to attend. Hmm.

579
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:42,535
Walter, the police said that some
of the Unidac bidders were murdered.

580
00:36:42,537 --> 00:36:44,621
I just think that we should
be a little bit more careful.

581
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:47,190
My mother's already lost a husband.

582
00:36:47,192 --> 00:36:50,693
Well, if moira shared your
concern, she wouldn't have come.

583
00:36:50,695 --> 00:36:53,463
And she definitely wouldn't
have brought your sister.

584
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,225
Hi.

585
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:19,061
Oliver, what a wonderful surprise.

586
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:22,064
I need you to get them
out of here right now.

587
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:38,780
Are you ok? Are you hurt?

588
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,633
No, I'm fine! Where is Walter?

589
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,302
Go, go, go, go! Walter's fine.

590
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,953
- Sir, I have to get you out of here.
- No, them!

591
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:46,788
Them.

592
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,724
Go, go, I'll find him,
ma'am, I'll find him.

593
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:13,562
Drop your guns.

594
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,365
I admire your work.

595
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,101
Guess you won't be extending
me any professional courtesy.

596
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:22,237
We're not in the same line of work.

597
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,606
Your profession is murder.

598
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:25,907
You've taken lives.

599
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:28,577
For the good of others.

600
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,912
You're out for yourself.

601
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:51,920
Hey.

602
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:56,847
