00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,099
<i>Will you have dinner with me tomorrow?</i>

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,499
<i>I'd like to dine with you for
the last time before I go.</i>

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,099
<i>It's the last time for the 3 of
us to meet before I disappear.</i>

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,099
<i>I wan't to change it into a nice memory.</i>

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>I don't want this time to
become a scar to Da Hye.</i>

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,999
<i>Lee Hae Joon and Han Gi
Tak know each other.</i>

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,199
The one person who knows
about Han Gi Tak's death.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
<i>I won't get ruined so easily.</i>

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>7027</i>

10
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,300
<i>Are you alright?</i>

11
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,099
<i>Excuse me, are you sure you're alright?</i>

12
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,900
<i>Are you okay?</i>

13
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,300
Wait just a bit long... I'll be there soon.

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm going.

15
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,099
<i>Be happy, Ahjumma.</i>

16
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,199
<i>Ajhumma.</i>

17
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,099
<i>Ahjumma, you're still there, right?</i>

18
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,200
<i>I'm almost there. You're
going to wait for me, right?</i>

19
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
I'm a little late, right?

20
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,300
They got soaked in the rain.
Will you still take them?

21
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,300
<i>Episode 15</i>

22
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,699
Did something happen?

23
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,099
I ran because I was running late.

24
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,899
You could have taken your time.

25
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,000
This time I didn't want to be late.

26
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,899
Over here.

27
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,799
Yes customer.

28
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,900
I placed an order in advance.
Is that alright?

29
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,499
The chef's special is
available for old times sake.

30
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,600
Of course.

31
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,899
See, the color will be distinct.

32
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,400
Such a nag.

33
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,899
Hey treat them well.

34
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
Yes, chef.

35
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,999

was so warm and I'm so thankful.

59
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,799
I wanted to invite you in a
delicious meal just once.

60
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,100
This is nothing in comparison to what
you've done for me during this time.

61
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Also for becoming a family to me

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,300
I'm very thankful.

63
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,800

Excuse me.

67
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,800
You are very beautiful today.

68
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Hae Joon! Hae Joon!

69
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,599
Hey honey, pull yourself together.

70
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,099
Hong Nan, what should we do?

71
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,399
Call 911 immediately!

72
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,899
Yes!

73
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,900
The blood is...

74
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,099
What?

75
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,600
It was good to have...

76
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,999
Will he be alright?

77
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,299
Patient are you alright?

78
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
Doctor!

79
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
What's the matter with this patient?

80
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:23,299
He was in a hit and run.

81
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,999
Let's examine him first.

82
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
Please stay here.

83
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,699
He never said a word.

84
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,899
He'll be alright.

85
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,200
Why is he like that? Why did
have to do it to this extent?

86
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,899
Release the kids are look for the car's
license plate. It's urgent so quickly.

87
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,100
Contact me as soon as you find it. Alright.

88
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,510
Are you going to kill him like this?

89
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,479
Unfortunately, I guess precious time
of Kim Yeong Soo's will be shortened.

90
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,769
What the heck nonsense is that? - It will
be difficult for him to over come today.

91
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,909
Perhaps, is he's dying again?

92
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,389
There's nothing we can do since it's a
self-inflicted injury after he came back here.

93
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,239
So he's dying again like this?

94
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,419
You're the one who made him Lee Hae Joon!

95
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,310
Save him right now!

96
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,290
It is not my authority to save someone.

97
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,380
You need to let them say
good bye to each other.

98
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,039
Save him.

99
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,749
What do I have to do?

100
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,220
I can't let him go like that!

101
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,569
There is a way.

102
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,769
What is it? I'll do anything.

103
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:39,530
Han Gi Tak, could you share
your remaining time with him?

104
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,430
Please. Please wake up.

105
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,700
If you don't wake up I'm going to be angry.

106
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,480
You said you were going tobe
like the wind that passes by.

107
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,240
You can't do this.

108
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,530
Wake up immediately and leave
from my house with a smile.

109
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,330
Let go home.

110
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Are you alright?

111
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,580
I want to go home.

112
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,179
I want to lay on my bed and listen to
Han Na babbling in the back round.

113
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,990
I want to eat the food you make me.

114
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,680
Let's go.

115
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,729
Where did this patient go?

116
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,100
He was discharged.

117
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,350
He has a brain hemorrhage!

118
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,850
What kind of accident is this
person responsible for this time?

119
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,619
You're here.-Yes.

120
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,849
He's starting to get me all worried!

121
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,849
What now?-Cha Jae Gook
is who I'm taking about.

122
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,949
He asks to eat together. He doesn't
laugh or talk in front of the kid.

123
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,259
Something seems off.

124
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,860
Is that so?

125
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,060
Oh my!

126
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,780
Isn't this me?

127
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,179
Hey how long has it been?

128
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,019
It's an interview from 10 years ago.

129
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,420
Hey, your brother saved
the weirdest things.

130
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,989
I don't know who it is but she's pretty.
Now and 16 years ago.

131
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,720
Am I not pretty?

132
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,669
You are.

133
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,279
Seriously, it's really been a long time.

134
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,420
I was so young.

135
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,069
Aigoo, Director Cha.

136
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,869
Meeting you like this is refreshing.
What a welcoming.

137
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,209
Your face really suits the
scene under this bridge.

138
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,770
It must be difficult being wanted?

139
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,709
It's time for you to save me now.

140
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,360
Give me what you've got.

141
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,009
This thing?

142
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,209
<i>Kill those bastards.</i>

143
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,699
Oh my so frightening.

144
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,340
It's time for you to verify the money.

145
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,570
The amount should be right.

146
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,250
Yes, this is the right amount.

147
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh my.

148
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,089
You've made some new friends already.

149
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,419
I can't leave a rabid dog
that bites his owner alone.

150
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,520
A rabid dog.

151
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,549
Oh yea, I wonder if you've already heard.

152
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,779
Lurking around where a rabid dog lives so,

153
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,609
I completely ran him over with the car.

154
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,849
Your rival Lee Hae Joon.

155
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,939
What? Lee Hae Joon?

156
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,149
Why did I run over Lee Hae Joon over?

157
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,309
That was because you told me to.

158
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,069
Just like you ordered
me to do to Han Gi Tak.

159
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,909
You killed him and want
to put the blame on me?

160
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,019
I need at least this amount of insurance
while cleaning up behind you.

161
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,289
You ordered me to kill Han Gi Tak.
You also ordered me to Lee Hae Joon.

162
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:49,050
This was all ordered by you.
Because you and I are one body.

163
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,329
This son of a b*tch.

164
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,860
How dare you frame me!

165
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
You're laughing?

166
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,090
Oh that hurts.

167
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,140
You think I would have come, bringing
that, with no backup plan in mind?

168
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,639
Surprise.

169
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,690
Wait for it.

170
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,939
Find him!

171
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,839
Go inside. Find him quickly!

172
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,550
This lurch individual! Find him quickly.

173
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,380
Find him!

It'll be bad if it leaves a scar.

183
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,450
Good morning, Ahjumma.

184
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,279
Are you feeling better now?

185
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,489
Yes, I'm feeling like a
really healthy person now.

186
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,840
That's good, let's go down and eat.

187
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,260
In my dream, it seemed like
somebody was caring for me.

188
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,730
Here.

189
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,700
Thank you.

190
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,610
Did I ask for the grape sticker?

191
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:50,089
Oh, Maya. I think the clock is broken. The
remaining time has decreased drastically.

192
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,639
It's not that it's broken.

193
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,589
What? What are you saying?

194
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:59,969
I'll just tell you that your time
not decreased but has increased.

195
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,889
You should be clearer so I can understand!

196
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,989
When you return, you'll find out.

197
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,809
Please, take good care
of the family matter.

198
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,369
This amount of time is impossible for me!

199
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,740
Just like everyone else.

200
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,029
<i>Why until now you pretended not to
know, I am curious as to your plan.</i>

201
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,469
It was good enough to make me wonder
if you were the Lee Hae Joon I knew.

202
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,659
That's because I couldn't
completely trust you.

203
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,999
I think you've said the same thing before.

204
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,529
It's not that simple for
me to trust people.

205
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:47,149
Sunjin Group's first member of international
support department, Lee Hae Joon.

206
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:53,249
Although Chairman was an official sponsor,
helping out a person who had lost his mother.

207
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,149
That person is the ex-secretary
of the Chairman, my father.

208
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,159
<i>That is something I did not expect coming.</i>

209
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,490
I wanted to confirm of the work you were
going to put in to Sunjin Group's future.

210
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,759
Currently, there is a fight going on
that is disadvantageous to Lee Hae Joon.

211
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,700
Now, can I help you?

212
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,699
Okay, the only way to block the sale of the
store is to become the real Lee Hae Joon.

213
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,059
- Hello. - Hello.

214
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,339
Hello!

215
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,119
Hi friend!

216
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,750
I came to raise the sales!

217
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,680
Hello.

218
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,990
Hong Nan was at the pub. Is
she not your manager anymore?

219
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,839
That restaurant was
originally her brother's.

220
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,479
I've heard that before.

221
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,920
She taught me how to box, saying her
brother taught her when she was younger.

222
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,019
Her brother was originally the chef there.

223
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,040
He also boxed on the side.

224
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,319
It seems like you're
close to Hong Nan, too.

225
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Han Gi Tak...

226
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,229
This person's name...

227
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,989
is Han Gi Tak.

228
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,710
Han Gi Tak?

229
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,990
I liked him a lot.

230
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,110
This person died...

231
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,370
Now, his younger brothers
are protecting me.

232
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,420
This person appeared
like it was meant to be.

233
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,469
Miss Da Hye, are you okay?

234
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,879
Yes, I'm okay.

235
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,020
That's strange. What's happening?

236
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,709
Branch Manager!

237
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,339
Have you seen this?

238
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,919
Oh my world!

239
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,779
The preparation for the temporary share
holder's meeting is going well, right?

240
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,289
So that we can secure the decision to
sell, make sure you manage the Directors.

241
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,720
The audio file that was
posted on the internet,

242
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,419
- Was it your voice that was recorded?
- What are you saying?

243
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,969
The one person who said
he killed Han Gi Tak,

244
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,489
It's spreading fast that it's your voice.

245
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,459
Tell them to stop saying nonsense.

246
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,189
As I am sensitive, facing the sale of
the store, who is trying to mess it up?

247
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,390
There is also movement from
the prosecutor's side.

248
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,950
CEO, there's a big problem!

249
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,740
If it's the truth, I can't
consider you as the CEO anymore.

250
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,109
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

251
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,560
Well... Are you okay?

252
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,319
I think this is talk about Gi Tak Hyung.

253
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,499
<i>What should I do CEO?</i>

254
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,359
<i>You dirty bastards.</i>

255
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,789
<i>Then according to the plan, Han Gi Tak...</i>

256
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,719
<i>Kill them! Those filthy rats!</i>

257
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,049
<i>Then I will follow along with the plan</i>

258
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:19,359
<i>I saw that too, but is
that this mall's chairman?</i>

259
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,389
<i>No way...</i>

260
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,079
<i>Die, you filthy rats!</i>

261
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,979
<i>So, as planned, Han Gi Tak...</i>

262
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,569
Han Gi Tak...

263
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,540
<i>Die, you filthy rats!</i>

264
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,300
Cha Jae Gook.

265
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:44,169
Da Hye... I'm sorry, looks
like I have to leave.

266
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,189
Miss Yi Yeon, are you okay?

267
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:53,160
Of course! I'll see you next time.

268
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,199
<i>Die! You filthy rats!</i>

269
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,139
You killed Han Gi Tak.

270
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,159
Who in the world told you this nonsense?!

271
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,849
Did yo order the killing of Han Gi Tak?

272
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,399
I'm Cha Jae Gook. How would, killing
a thug like him, benefit me?

273
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,549
I will kill everyone
that's been saying that.

274
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,979
Alright,

275
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,259
It can't be you.

276
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,409
If it is you, I will demolish you.

277
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,919
Right, you're finally showing
your actual self, Lee Hae Joon.

278
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,609
The people's misery that
you've stepped on...

279
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,790
I will help you feel that misery soon, too.

280
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,829
No...

281
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,109
Song Yi Yeon...

282
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,390
No matter how mean that person is...

283
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,170
He would never go this far.

284
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,870
Hong Nan, I'm sorry. I have things
to do so I'll be leaving first.

285
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,590
Did you hear that?

286
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:26,559
Cha Jae Gook, Na Seuk Chul...
They killed Hyungnim.

287
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,460
Follow Song Yi Yeon.

288
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:31,589
Is she the problem right now?
Your brother was killed!

289
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,329
- I'm asking you.- Han Hong Nan!

290
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:38,280
Think about what Han Gi Tak wants.

291
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,490
Miss Hong Nan, are you okay?

292
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,830
This is what I wanted to say.

293
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,650
Here.

294
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you okay?

295
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,129
I'm not.

296
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,600
I'm not okay whatsoever.

297
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,169
I didn't live that nicely.

298
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,539
But it makes me wonder if I lived mean
enough to make someone want to kill me.

299
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,459
What are you saying?

300
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,690
Throwing away my family,
hurting the person I love.

301
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,029
I wonder if this is the punishment
I'm receiving for those things.

302
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,859
Stop saying this!

303
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,589
I will definitely, 100% find
out who made you like this!

304
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:43,029
In that time, just stay
next to Hong Nan's side.

305
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,490
She asked me if I was okay.

306
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,479
Even though I am feeling so
guilty because I died that way.

307
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,690
Since I can't stay by her side,

308
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,010
in my place,

309
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,420
stay by her side and protect her.

310
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,090
Even if it's just for the
remainder of your time.

311
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:18,609
I promise. I will dedicate
all of the time I have left.

312
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,850
And I'll stay by her side.

313
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:32,779
<i>Han Gi Tak. That person's
name is Han Gi Tak.</i>

314
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,839
<i>I told you if you cry everywhere, you're
the Ugly One. You're so cool, my sister.</i>

315
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,259
<i>Where are you going?</i>

316
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,500
Da Hye... Da Hye?

317
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,800
Did you have a bad dream?

318
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,990
May be it's because I feel worried
but something feels strange.

319
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,090
I'm uneasy, I feel like
something bad will happen.

320
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,229
Can I ask for a favor?

321
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,109
You can ask me anything.

322
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,140
Even if you leave,

323
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,689
don't leave without telling me.

324
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:21,710
At least let us do our
farewells before you leave.

325
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,160
I understand. I promise.

326
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,829
You finally showed up.

327
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,829
Did you really do it?

328
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:11,519
You... You ordered for
Han Gi Tak to be killed?

329
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,519
The first thing you say after years
of not coming in here, is that?

330
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,030
It's not true right? It's not, right?

331
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,489
Say something! It's not right?
Tell me that it wasn't you!!

332
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,599
You have to not done it! You didn't do it!

333
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,510
No!! No no no!!

334
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,679
Yeah, I killed him. I
tried to kill that punk.

335
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,530
I told them to rip him to pieces and leave no
trace of him and kill him, is that enough?!

336
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,919
Please tell me it wasn't you.

337
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,230
No! Nope!

338
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:06,120
I killed him! Why? It's
because of you, Song Yi Yeon.

339
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,870
It was because of you.

340
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:43,550
Timing and Subtitles brought to
you by The Possessed Team @ Viki

341
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,970
Where are you? I don't have much time left.

342
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,969
Are you going into the
prosecutor's office?-Yes.

343
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,680
CEO, don't you think a humble
looking clothing will be better?

344
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,840
Why should I? Did I commit a crime?

345
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,990
Welcome.

346
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,759
What is all of this?

347
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,479
Cha Jae Gook is currently denying the charge that
he ordered the killing at the Prosecutor's office.

348
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,529
But Jeong Ji Hoon and Choi Seung Jae said,

349
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:57,519
that there were lots of
questionable aspects to your case.

350
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,029
So I looked into it again.

351
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,010
The truth behind Han Gi Tak's death.

352
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,359
Spill what you have.

353
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,629
Here, first, the whereabouts of the black
box that should've been at the site.

354
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,579
Second, the paparazzi and the driver,
both of their whereabouts are unknown.

355
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,749
Third, in the site where there
are no CCTVs to be found.

356
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,479
They made the accident happen in a
place where there are no CCTVs.

357
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,660
-So what?-So! What do you think we need?

358
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,830
Brain. We will find out what
happened through your memories.

359
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,359
<i>Oh, Seung Jae. Let's talk later.</i>

360
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,069
<i>What happened, Boss? The police
came to the restaurant too.</i>

361
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,189
<i>- What?-They're looking for you. What
did they mean by a case of violence?</i>

362
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,189
<i>Exactly what happened—</i>

363
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,020
<i>So you wanna go, huh? Alright
then, let's go to the end.</i>

364
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,819
<i>Han Gi Tak was in the midst of following the
paparazzi to show that Song Yi Yeon was innocent.</i>

365
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,959
<i>He found about the Yoo Hyuk's assult</i>

366
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,390
<i>and assumed that he fell into a
trap that was set up by somebody.</i>

367
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,050
<i>From following the paparazzi,
you got in the first accident.</i>

368
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,499
<i>The second accident was when the
truck came at Han Gi Tak's car.</i>

369
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,589
That's when he officially died.

370
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,649
Do you remember anything regarding
the accident? Anything strange?

371
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm not sure.

372
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,180
Now that I think about it...<i>What's this?
Outer limit?</i>

373
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,139
<i>There was a cigarette in my pocket.</i>

374
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,859
<i>What's with this?</i>

375
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:27,810
<i>It's been quite a long
time since I quit smoking.</i>

376
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,660
<i>Are you alright, Ahjusshi?</i>

377
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,100
<i>Are you dead or alive?</i>

378
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,800
<i>Ahjusshi!</i>

379
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,530
<i>Seems like he's dead.</i>

380
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,029
I took care of the driver.

381
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,740
<i>Go then.</i>

382
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,930
<i>What should I do, Chairman?</i>

383
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,659
<i>These dirty scumbags.</i>

384
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,409
<i>- Then as contract, Han
Gi Tak... Kill that trash!</i>

385
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,239
<i>Just do it as planned. And
make sure there's no trace.</i>

386
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,239
<i>At the Prosecutor, he said that the statement
he made about killing him was just a metaphor.</i>

387
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,779
<i>The original plan was to lock Song Yi
Yeon in the house with the scandal.</i>

388
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:55,370
<i>Yes, I will clean up Han
Gi Tak without a mess.</i>

389
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,190
<i>You worked hard. Now just rest.</i>

390
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,540
<i>Na Seok Cheol, you punk...</i>

391
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,820
<i>He used Cha Jae Gook to kill Han Gi Tak.</i>

392
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:38,220
<i>How sad. He should fall into hell's pit.</i>

393
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,749
The person to commit your hit
and run was also Na Seok Cheul.

394
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,399
Na Seok Cheol, that guy...
What is his motive?

395
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,659
The person that was like
his parent, Big Hyungnim.

396
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,390
Killing his friends and only
following the line of the money.

397
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,529
Now, he has nothing to lose.

398
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,530
Now that Cha Jae Gook is like that. The
remaining hope for Na Seok Cheol is...

399
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,690
The secret account number?

400
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:08,189
Until Na Seok Chul dies,

401
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,270
I have to be Han Gi Tak's sister.
It has to be.

402
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,129
Will it be alright? After we pass on,

403
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:23,439
Da Hye and Yi Yeon... Will they be alright?

404
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,200
I have to hurry and catch Na Seok
Cheol while I'm still around.

405
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,999
What's this? Why is yours so different from
mine? How come you have so little time left?

406
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,189
What's different!?

407
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,719
What did you do?

408
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,260
<i>It's not that Kim Yeong Soo's time got shorter.
I'll just tell you that it got longer.</i>

409
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,429
Could it be... You have
some of your time to me?

410
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,060
They said you can't pass two days.

411
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,600
It's for the sake of my younger sibling.

412
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,760
This person, in this time, I told
you to do well to your wife.

413
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,069
<i>Really pathetic.</i>

414
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,609
- Pathetic?- Pathetic?

415
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,159
<i>What am I supposed to do when
I want to forget but I can't?</i>

416
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,699
<i>I want to take it out of this
heart, but it doesn't work.</i>

417
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,639
<i>They're in front of my eyes and it
makes me want to pull my eyes out.</i>

418
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,279
Is that being pathetic?

419
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,960
<i>I'm the most pathetic
person on this planet.</i>

<i>How nice would it be if he was there?</i>

421
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:40,230
<i>To see how pretty and energetic
your sister grew up...</i>

422
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,340
<i>That would've been so nice it together.</i>

423

Cha Jae Gook is probably very

Long time no see, Directors.

I heard something odd. I heard
something has been added.

462
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,419
(1) Dismissal of the CEO.

(2) Putting the mall up for sale

Until now, I was buying it up a bit by bit, thanks
to you who make the stock price drop significantly.

473
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:30,020
It's enough if it's 4.9%, right?

474
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,319
The image of Sunjin Mall is being shaken by the
continuous deteriorating image of the Chairman.

475
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,089
To move in the direction
that the company wants and

476
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,459
to withstand the adverse wind where our roots
don't shake, we have to make Sunjin like that.

477
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:03,150
For those reasons, I request that
we dismiss the CEO Cha Chae Gook..

478
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,789
Father, you raised a son well.

479
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,929
You must be happy. Since you
got one out of the two right.

480
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:16,659
The voting for the dismissal
of Cha Jae Gook has started.

481
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,399
We will vote now.

482
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,750
Everyone who wishes this to
pass, please raise your hands.

483
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,650
Cha Jae Gook's dismissal has
passed with everyone in favor.

484
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,570
For now, Lee Hae Joon, you
take over as the CEO.

485
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,350
It is a great decision you made.

486
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,199
It was for the company.

487
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,639
Are you trying to comfort me?

488
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,840
I know that you weren't
trying to kill Han Gi Tak.

489
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,980
Get lost.

490
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,029
You finally got the company.

491
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,509
Yeah.

492
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:42,909
But why are we seeing each other here?
It's awkward.

493
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,459
I decided to meet with Da Hye?

494
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,799
What?

495
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,439
Sit down. You know you've
been wanting to see her.

496
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,119
She's the one that said she
wanted to meet you first.

497
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,730
What?

498
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,570
Hong Nan!

499
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:07,990
This... I found it when I
was cleaning your room.

500
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:14,819
The kid on this picture is me.
I don't know why it was there.

501
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,489
Tell me, how did get have this?

502
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,410
Truthfully...

503
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,620
I found your brother.

504
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,879
But I can't tell you about his
name, his age and his whereabouts.

505
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,919
It's something the person doesn't want.

506
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,540
Although he can't can't show himself to
you, but one thing I am sure about is

507
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:46,490
that they love you very much and let you
go because they wanted to protect you.

508
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:57,400
My brother... is Han Gi Tak?

509
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,700
It's too far.

510
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,740
What are you doing? You have no guts?

511
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,370
Wait. They saw us!

512
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,450
Hey!

513
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:58,640
Father!

514
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:12,020
