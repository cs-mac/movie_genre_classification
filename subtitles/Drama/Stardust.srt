1
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,260
A philosopher once asked,

2
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:45,862
"Are we human
because we gaze at the stars,

3
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:49,707
"or do we gaze at them
because we are human?"

4
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,210
Pointless, really.

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,182
Do the stars gaze back?

6
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,059
Now, that's a question.

7
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:01,869
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

8
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,137
Our story really begins here,

9
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:08,877
150 years ago
at the Royal Academy of Science

10
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,285
in London, England,

11
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:17,132
where a letter arrived,
containing a very strange inquiry.

12
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,236
It had come from a country boy

13
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:26,513
and the scientist who read it thought it
might be a practical joke of some kind.

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,250
But he duly wrote a reply

15
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:32,524
politely explaining
that the query was nonsense.

16
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,603
And posted it to the boy
who lived in a village called Wall,

17
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,809
so named, the boy had said,
for the wall that ran alongside it.

18
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:48,885
A wall that, according to local folklore,
hid an extraordinary secret.

19
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:53,461
I'm charged with guarding the portal
to another world.

20
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:58,014
And you're asking me
to just let you through?

21
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:02,020
Yes.
Because, let's be honest, it's a field.

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,492
Look, do you see
another world out there?

23
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:10,197
No. You see a field.
Do you see anything nonhuman?

24
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:13,800
No. And you know why?
Because it's a field!

25
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:17,146
Hundreds of years,
this wall's been here.

26
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:22,024
Hundreds of years,
this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

27
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:24,964
- Well...
- One more word,

28
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:29,030
and I'll have you up
in front of the village council!

29
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:33,847
- Well, that sounds rather final.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:40,287
- Better just go home, then, I suppose.
- Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

31
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,262
Give my best to your father.

32
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,568
Stop!

33
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,107
Stop!

34
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:37,301
I don't deal with time-wasters.

35
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,209
Get over here and tend this stall.

36
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:42,251
I'm off to The Slaughtered Prince
for a pint.

37
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,431
See anything you like?

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,907
Definitely.

39
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:59,679
I mean, what I meant was these ones,
the blue ones.

40
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,251
How much are they?

41
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:05,228
They might be the color of your hair.

42
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:09,465
Or they might be all of your memories
before you were three.

43
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,839
I can check if you like.

44
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:16,386
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
Buy this one instead.

45
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:18,654
Snowdrop.

46
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,528
It'll bring you luck.

47
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:25,837
But what does that cost?

48
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,476
This one costs a kiss.

49
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:51,120
Is she gone?

50
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,423
Follow me.

51
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,552
I'm a princess,
tricked into being a witch's slave.

52
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:12,519
Will you liberate me?

53
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:25,278
It's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.

54
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,717
Sorry.

55
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,529
Well, if I can't liberate you,
what do you want of me?

56
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:52,898
So, the scientist was wrong.

57
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,875
The wall had successfully done its job

58
00:05:56,984 --> 00:06:01,254
of hiding
the magical kingdom of Stormhold.

59
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:05,231
The young man returned that night
to his home in England,

60
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:08,568
hoping that his adventure
would soon be forgotten.

61
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:13,638
But nine months later,
he received an unexpected souvenir.

62
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:27,301
This was left at the wall for you.
It says here his name is Tristan.

63
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,327
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

64
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,027
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

65
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:02,845
Eighteen years passed,
and the baby Tristan grew up

66
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:06,283
knowing nothing
of his unconventional heritage.

67
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:12,025
But never mind
how the infant became a boy.

68
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,436
This is the story of
how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,

69
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:19,802
a much greater challenge altogether.

70
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,115
For to achieve it,

71
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,285
he must win the heart
of his one true love.

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,298
- It's him!
- It's him!

73
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,479
Humphrey?

74
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:36,740
Humphrey?

75
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,342
- No, it's Tristan.
- Oh.

76
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,884
Did I leave something at the shop?

77
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,430
No. I just thought I could bring...

78
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,897
Tristan Thorn,

79
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,910
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

80
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:55,278
Is there no end to your charms?

81
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,414
Humphrey,
there's no need to be like that.

82
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:00,458
Be nice to the poor boy.

83
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,698
Were those for Victoria?

84
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:21,092
You were always useless at fencing
in school, Tristan.

85
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,536
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering
if there was anything you were good at.

86
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,043
Humphrey, that's enough.

87
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,782
Are you all right?

88
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,121
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

89
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,140
- Want some breakfast?
- No, I'm really late for work.

90
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:03,978
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine. Why?

91
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,583
Oh, I don't know.
Last night, how'd it go?

92
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:12,098
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

93
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:28,662
Hello, Tristan.

94
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,260
- Victoria.
- Pound of sugar, please.

95
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,407
- Yes.
- Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

96
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,580
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.

97
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,288
I also need a sack of potatoes
and some chocolate, please.

98
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:50,541
May I perhaps see you tonight?

99
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:54,073
No, but you may walk me home.

100
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:56,478
Now?

101
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:59,152
Yes. Yes, I can.

102
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:08,340
Father, I lost my job.

103
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:12,715
Father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.

104
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,017
- Father...
- You lost your job.

105
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:17,385
Yes, so I heard.

106
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,532
Father, I'm sorry. I...

107
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,474
Maybe Mr. Monday was right.
Maybe I am deluding myself.

108
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:28,812
- I'm not good enough for Victoria.
- He said that? That's poppycock.

109
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,682
You really want to know
how it went last night?

110
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:31,881
Yeah.

111
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,055
Not good.

112
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,557
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

113
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:40,102
I'm not like Humphrey.

114
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:45,583
Tristan, I can tell you that every man
I ever envied when I was a boy

115
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,481
has led an unremarkable life.

116
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,226
So you don't fit with the popular crowd.
Now, I take that as a very good omen.

117
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,026
- Tristan, I clearly said...
- I know. You told me not to come.

118
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:12,729
I have something for you. A surprise.

119
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,932
No...

120
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:32,333
It's not my birthday for another week,
you know.

121
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,252
- I've never had champagne before.
- Yeah, me, neither.

122
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,027
My God! This is delicious!

123
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,704
How did... Well,
how does a shop boy afford all of this?

124
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,502
I'm not a shop boy.

125
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,641
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
What are you going to do now?

126
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:56,519
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.

127
00:11:56,623 --> 00:11:59,857
And now I'm not.
Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

128
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:02,434
This must have been all your savings.

129
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:05,564
So? I can make more.
That's the beauty of it.

130
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,268
I never intended to stay in Wall,
Victoria.

131
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:10,714
There's a big world out there,
I'm gonna make my fortune.

132
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:13,448
Now you sound just like Humphrey.
He's quite a traveler.

133
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:17,793
Do you know he's going all the way
to lpswich just to buy me a ring?

134
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,333
Lpswich?

135
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:23,398
Victoria, I'm talking about London
or Paris or...

136
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,313
A ring? Why is he...
What kind of a ring?

137
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,287
The word is he's planning to propose
to me on my birthday.

138
00:12:30,423 --> 00:12:31,982
He's going to...

139
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,729
And you're gonna say yes.

140
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:38,362
I can't exactly say no
after he's gone all the way to lpswich.

141
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,568
"All the way to lpswich"?

142
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:45,584
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,
I'd cross oceans or continents.

143
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:47,913
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,424
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

145
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,897
I would go to
the gold fields of San Francisco

146
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,471
and bring you back your weight in gold.

147
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,603
I would.

148
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,576
I'd go to Africa and bring you back
a diamond as big as your fist.

149
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:06,190
Or I'd go to the Arctic
and I'd slaughter a polar bear

150
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:08,422
and bring you back its head.

151
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,497
A polar bear's head?

152
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,046
You're funny, Tristan.

153
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:23,092
People like you and people like me,
we're just not...

154
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,436
I should be going. It's really late.

155
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:32,067
Well, hold on, then.
Let's at least finish the champagne.

156
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,373
Okay.

157
00:13:38,824 --> 00:13:42,821
Had Tristan known then
how the stars watched Earth,

158
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,731
he'd have shuddered at the very thought

159
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:47,238
of an audience to his humiliation.

160
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,409
But, fortunately for him,

161
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,487
nearly every star in the sky
was at that moment

162
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:58,722
looking in earnest at the land
on the other side of the wall,

163
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,395
where the King of all Stormhold
lay on his deathbed,

164
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:06,409
which was a coincidence
because it was the King's final act

165
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,887
that would change the course
of Tristan's destiny forever.

166
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,062
Where is Secundus?

167
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,060
He's on his way, Father.

168
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,866
Then we shall wait.

169
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:34,527
Sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.

170
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,673
Septimus.

171
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,308
Primus.

172
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,646
Tertius.

173
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:49,794
So, to the matter of succession.

174
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,708
Of my seven sons,
there are four of you today still standing.

175
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,114
This is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.

176
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,018
And you killed them all for your throne

177
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:06,152
before your father, the King,
even felt poorly.

178
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:09,733
We know, Father.
You're strong and courageous.

179
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:13,707
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

180
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:18,179
- Secundus.
- Yes, Father?

181
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:22,590
Look through the window.
Tell me what you see.

182
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,469
I see the kingdom, Father.

183
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:34,912
The whole of Stormhold.

184
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,720
- And?
- My kingdom?

185
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,229
Maybe. Look up.

186
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:12,885
- Secundus.
- Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

187
00:16:14,096 --> 00:16:18,196
You're alive. You're...

188
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:21,208
Stuck like this
till the new king is crowned.

189
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:24,175
I was that close.

190
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,549
Well, at least
you haven't lost your looks.

191
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,558
Oh, please. You're not annoyed
about that whole murder thing, are you?

192
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,655
- I mean, that was 10 years ago.
- Yeah.

193
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,668
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it,
killing me, Secundus?

194
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,038
Because now, of course,
now you are King of all Stormhold.

195
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,013
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not.
You're dead.

196
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:44,281
Una? Una?

197
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:48,453
No, Father, it's me, your son.

198
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,594
Tertius.

199
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,738
Where is your sister, Una?

200
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:59,146
Sorry, Father.
Nobody has seen Una for years now.

201
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,449
- Septimus?
- What?

202
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:07,056
Tradition dictates the throne must pass
to a male heir.

203
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,295
Exactly, Father.

204
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,137
So why would I kill my sister
when these cretins are still alive?

205
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,404
Indeed.

206
00:17:14,882 --> 00:17:20,757
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation
in a non-traditional manner.

207
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:49,848
Only he of royal blood
can restore the ruby.

208
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,590
And the one of you that does so
shall be the new King of Stormhold.

209
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:49,927
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

210
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:52,536
Beautiful.

211
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,718
More beautiful than a fancy ring
from lpswich?

212
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:06,330
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

213
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:10,101
I'd cross the wall
and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

214
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,368
You can't cross the wall.

215
00:19:12,746 --> 00:19:15,343
Nobody crosses the wall.
Now you're just being silly.

216
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,288
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

217
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,053
For you, I'd do anything.

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,936
My very own star.

219
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:31,309
It seems we have ourselves
an agreement.

220
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:35,655
You have exactly one week
or I'm marrying Humphrey.

221
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,897
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

222
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:56,404
- What is it?
- A star has fallen.

223
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,064
Where are the Babylon candles?

224
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,872
You used the last one, Lamia,
200 years ago. Do you not recall?

225
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,615
Perhaps we can obtain another.

226
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:13,241
Perhaps we can obtain another.

227
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,789
Has your mind become
as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

228
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,657
You speak as if such things
are freely available.

229
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:21,129
I know, sister, I merely thought...

230
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,758
You'd have us hunting
for a Babylon candle

231
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,636
while some other witch finds our star.

232
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:28,337
Fool. There's no time to waste.

233
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,882
If we must retrieve it on foot,
then we shall.

234
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,082
Mormo, we need information.

235
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:48,216
If these divinations are correct,
the fallen star lies 100 miles away.

236
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:56,733
Four centuries we've waited for this.
What hardship a few more days?

237
00:21:56,836 --> 00:22:00,275
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it
and bring it back?

238
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,258
- I've his kidney.
- I've his liver.

239
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,059
And I've his heart.

240
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,699
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

241
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,527
- There's not much left.
- Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

242
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:29,609
- Dunstan Thorn. Not again.
- It's Tristan, actually.

243
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:34,449
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.

244
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,022
And I suppose you intend
to cross the wall as well, do you?

245
00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:39,967
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

246
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:42,235
Cross the wall as well as who?

247
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:45,378
No one. Nobody.

248
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:47,952
Nobody crosses the wall.
You know that!

249
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:50,320
Everybody knows that!

250
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:53,956
Yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.

251
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,171
Well, I better just head
for the old homestead, then.

252
00:23:58,274 --> 00:23:59,401
Yeah.

253
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,677
- Right, then. Night, Tristan.
- Good night.

254
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:05,879
Give my best to your father.

255
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,400
Off you go.

256
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:39,751
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

257
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,084
No, I'm fine.

258
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:42,683
- That Humphrey again?
- No.

259
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:46,130
Actually, it was the guard.
The guard at the wall.

260
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,437
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

261
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,674
Well, that's given him plenty of time
to practice, then, hasn't it?

262
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:56,348
Why, may I ask,
were you trying to cross the wall?

263
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,926
I might ask you the same thing.

264
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,321
I have a mother.

265
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:56,739
I mean, I have a mother.
She could still be alive.

266
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,777
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

267
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,349
The chain you cut.

268
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:07,858
Just like you said.

269
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:09,088
And...

270
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,707
And the glass flower.
The flower she sold to you.

271
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,802
She told me it would bring me luck.

272
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:18,211
Thank you.

273
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,185
This was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.

274
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:25,760
It's addressed to you.

275
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,222
Yep.

276
00:26:43,332 --> 00:26:47,830
"My dearest Tristan, please know that
I only ever wanted the best for you."

277
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:53,307
Had my mistress allowed it,
I would have kept you in a heartbeat.

278
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,523
My dearest wish is that
we will meet someday.

279
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:02,066
The fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

280
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:06,375
To use it, think of me and only me.

281
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:11,250
I will think of you every day, for always.

282
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,359
"Your mother."

283
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,170
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

284
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,566
Mother?

285
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,904
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

286
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:17,277
No, I'm not.
And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

287
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:20,480
You're... You're not my mother?

288
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,890
Do I look like I'm your mother?

289
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,288
No.

290
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,760
Sorry.

291
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,769
Well, are you all right?
Do you want some help?

292
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,244
You can help by leaving me alone!

293
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:35,848
All right.

294
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,505
Oh, my God.
"Light the candle and think of me."

295
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,634
I was. I was thinking of my...

296
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,477
But then Victoria and the star
just popped into...

297
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,451
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

298
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:01,467
This may seem strange, but
have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

299
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:04,070
- You're funny.
- No, really, we're in a crater.

300
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,270
This must be where it fell.

301
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,342
Yeah, this is where it fell.

302
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,422
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

303
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:13,857
up there is where
this weird, bloody necklace

304
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,089
came out of nowhere
and knocked it out of the heavens

305
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,031
when it was minding its own business.

306
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:20,037
And over there is where it landed.

307
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:25,913
And right here, this is where it got hit
by a magical flying moron!

308
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:32,325
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

309
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:37,598
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...

310
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,445
May I just say in advance
that I am sorry?

311
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,879
- Sorry for what?
- For this.

312
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:47,892
Now, if I am not mistaken,
this means you have to come with me.

313
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,660
See, you're going to be a birthday gift
for Victoria, my true love.

314
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,135
But of course!

315
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:57,235
Nothing says romance like the gift
of a kidnapped, injured woman!

316
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:59,879
I'm not going anywhere with you.

317
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:08,031
Hurry. You should be
on your way now, Primus.

318
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:13,299
You must find the royal necklace
with the ruby before your brothers.

319
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,818
I should like to see you take the throne.
The first benevolent king.

320
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:22,518
I don't doubt Stormhold would be
a better place under your rule.

321
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:23,858
Really?

322
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,458
Well, that is fascinating.

323
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,699
- Don't you think, Tertius?
- Yes, indeed.

324
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:33,613
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
Well, well, I...

325
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:38,219
Since you're all here,
won't you join me in a toast?

326
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,592
What a very good idea.

327
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,102
To the new King of Stormhold,

328
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:47,438
whichever of you fine fellows
it might be.

329
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,376
To the new King of Stormhold.

330
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,857
You!

331
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,978
You really thought that you were king?

332
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:02,689
- You killed the Bishop?
- No, Primus.

333
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:07,632
I think you'll find that you killed the
Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

334
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,640
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling
with your conscience,

335
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:13,473
may I suggest you return
to your chamber?

336
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,982
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

337
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:26,067
How have we lived this way
all these years?

338
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:43,026
In my absence, I expect you to make it
fit for the queens we are.

339
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:49,013
When I return with our prize,
all of us shall be young again.

340
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,847
Never fear, my sisters.

341
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,953
I will not fail.

342
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,851
Don't you ever sleep?

343
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:08,921
Not at night.

344
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,756
May have escaped your notice, genius,

345
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,886
but that's when stars
have rather better things to do.

346
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:15,297
They're coming out, shining,
that sort of thing.

347
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:18,635
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours,
but you're not in the sky anymore.

348
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,711
Coming out is off the agenda.

349
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:24,512
Shining has been suspended
until further notice.

350
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:28,058
Oh, and sleeping during the day
is O-U-T.

351
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:32,255
Unless you have some magical ability
to sleep while you're walking.

352
00:33:32,368 --> 00:33:34,736
Have you not got it
into your thick head yet?

353
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,832
I'm not walking anywhere!

354
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:38,739
Fine.

355
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:42,344
Sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.

356
00:33:42,722 --> 00:33:45,318
I was gonna put you back in the sky
once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

357
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:48,627
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own
in the middle of nowhere forever.

358
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:52,104
And just how were you planning
to get me back to the sky?

359
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:55,475
I find the fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

360
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:59,786
- You've got a Babylon candle.
- Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

361
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:01,448
- A Babylon candle.
- That's what I said.

362
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,549
You said "Bubbling."

363
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:05,063
Anyway, I was going to give
what's left of it to you.

364
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,500
Well, that barely has one use left.

365
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:12,102
So be grateful I'm not using it right now
to get us both back to the wall.

366
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:15,583
Unless you have a better way of
getting yourself home.

367
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,352
Fine!

368
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:21,457
Help me up.

369
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:24,535
All right. All right. I'm helping.

370
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,500
And you are gonna have to walk
quicker than that.

371
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,377
Otherwise, I'll never get you back
to Victoria in a week.

372
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:31,950
Don't push your luck.

373
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,694
Don't take less than a florin for him,
Bernard! You understand?

374
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:39,926
- Yes, Mother.
- No dilly-dallying!

375
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,940
And don't even think of stopping at the
tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

376
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,171
A florin for your goat, boy.

377
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,054
Oh.

378
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:54,027
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

379
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:57,595
You're quite right.

380
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,653
That's much better.

381
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:15,564
Bernard!

382
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:18,637
Bernard!

383
00:35:40,887 --> 00:35:42,082
Get on!

384
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:19,625
Who goes there?

385
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,723
What do you want with me,
a poor old flower...

386
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,772
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

387
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:29,508
and I swear by the ordinances of the
sisterhood to which we both belong

388
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:32,086
that I mean you no harm this day.

389
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:34,180
I wish to share your meal.

390
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:40,501
Well, one can never be too careful.
Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

391
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,254
- Anything else?
- Nope.

392
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:56,425
What's it to be?

393
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,596
Heads or tails?

394
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,436
Heads.

395
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:03,977
So, stranger,

396
00:37:04,451 --> 00:37:07,446
where are you headed off to
on this fine day?

397
00:37:07,557 --> 00:37:09,493
I seek a fallen star.

398
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,362
She fell not far from here.

399
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,699
And when I find her,
I shall take my great knife

400
00:37:14,804 --> 00:37:17,275
and cut out her heart
while she still lives.

401
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:21,841
And the glory of our youth
shall be restored.

402
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,820
Fallen star?

403
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:27,519
That's the best news I've had in ages.

404
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,396
I could do with losing
a few years meself.

405
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:32,564
So whereabouts did you...

406
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,199
Limbus grass!

407
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:39,650
You dare to steal truth from my lips
by feeding me limbus grass?

408
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:44,024
Do you have any idea what a big
mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

409
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,226
How do you know my...

410
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,328
- Who are you?
- Look again.

411
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:55,783
I shall not seek the star,
Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

412
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:57,548
Seek all you wish.

413
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:03,188
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

414
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:07,766
You will not perceive her
even if she stands before you.

415
00:38:14,756 --> 00:38:17,728
Pray you never meet me again,
Ditchwater Sal.

416
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,424
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.

417
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:23,096
You think you know
we're going the right way because...

418
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:25,972
And I quote, "I just do."

419
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:27,775
I do, though. I don't know why.

420
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,547
Maybe it's my love for Victoria
guiding me home.

421
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:32,213
- Please.
- Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

422
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,954
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

423
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,362
How many times do I have to...

424
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,234
Would you...
Would you please slow down?

425
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:41,602
Yes, yes.

426
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:44,707
Look, we're...
We're going north, all right?

427
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:46,079
The wall's north.

428
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:49,351
And if you look up in the sky,
even during the day, you can see the...

429
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,153
The evening star. That's so weird.

430
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:53,127
That's funny. Hilarious.
My sides are splitting.

431
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:54,825
No, I'm being...

432
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:59,203
Wait that... That was you! Really?

433
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:02,243
What... What are...

434
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,684
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

435
00:39:04,788 --> 00:39:06,951
- Sitting down. I'm tired.
- Please don't do this again.

436
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,529
We agreed we'd stop off
at the next village to eat and rest.

437
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,602
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

438
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:17,542
I never stay up this late!
Just, please, let me sleep!

439
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:22,879
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.

440
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,865
What are you doing?

441
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:35,208
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making sure you don't run away.

442
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:55,753
Your Highness, the soothsayer,
as you requested.

443
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,784
South, you said.

444
00:39:59,762 --> 00:40:01,253
South we went.

445
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,227
Still no stone.

446
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:08,270
Do you now propose
we start swimming?

447
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:13,447
Sire, I've merely relayed to you
what the runes have told me.

448
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,150
I can do no more.

449
00:40:16,428 --> 00:40:18,398
Well, consult them again.

450
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,926
Wait.

451
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:26,938
Before we seek the stone,
I have another question.

452
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:30,685
Am I the seventh son?

453
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,325
Yes.

454
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,063
Another question.

455
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,436
Is my favorite color blue?

456
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,142
Yes.

457
00:40:46,254 --> 00:40:49,988
Has excessive begging or pleading
ever persuaded me

458
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,361
to spare the life of a traitor?

459
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:57,197
What does that mean?

460
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:59,871
- That means no.
- Good.

461
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,787
Throw them again.
This time, throw them high.

462
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:09,924
Do you work for my brother?

463
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:29,394
So, do we continue west?

464
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:01,093
Tristan?

465
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:11,518
Who's there?

466
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,767
Tristan, is that you?

467
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,365
It's not funny.

468
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,949
Tristan?

469
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,371
Come on.

470
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:26,392
Be careful how much magic
you use, sister.

471
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:28,300
It's beginning to show.

472
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,741
One goat and a small enchantment.
Hardly extravagant.

473
00:43:31,846 --> 00:43:34,783
Well, even using the ring
will take its toll.

474
00:43:34,885 --> 00:43:37,219
Better you call on us only in dire need.

475
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,625
And use your runes
to locate the star yourself.

476
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:42,722
I used them and she should be here.

477
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,634
But now
they're just telling me gibberish.

478
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,907
It is because you must stay
where you are, my sister.

479
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,242
She is coming to you.

480
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,978
Oh, be warned, Lamia.
Delicacy is needed.

481
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:14,117
Misery has drained her.
She's barely shining.

482
00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:18,966
Set a trap that ensures her heart
is glowing before you cut it out.

483
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:22,972
Yvaine! Yvaine!

484
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:25,339
Oh, you idiot.

485
00:44:47,126 --> 00:44:49,757
You shall become human.

486
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:11,085
You are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

487
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:15,656
Now, make everything ready.
Our special guest will be here soon.

488
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:30,688
I mean, who's to say he'd have even
kept his promise about the candle?

489
00:46:30,796 --> 00:46:34,463
I just refuse to believe
he's the only person in Stormhold

490
00:46:34,571 --> 00:46:36,268
who could've helped me.

491
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:40,644
Going on and on and on.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

492
00:46:43,054 --> 00:46:44,283
Tristan?

493
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:48,322
Please protect our sister, Tristan.

494
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:52,202
Yvaine is in grave danger.

495
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,340
The unicorn came to help her.

496
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,573
But now they're heading into a trap.

497
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:05,393
No star is safe in Stormhold.

498
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:10,637
The last to fall, 400 years ago,

499
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:16,083
was captured by the same witches
who seek Yvaine now.

500
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:18,917
They tricked her,

501
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,952
cared for her,

502
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:26,899
and when her heart
was once more aglow,

503
00:47:27,508 --> 00:47:30,878
they cut it from her chest

504
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,579
and ate it.

505
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:38,128
There's no time to waste.

506
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,960
A coach is coming.

507
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,699
By any means possible,
you must get on it.

508
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:45,400
Run.

509
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,463
Whoa!

510
00:48:25,957 --> 00:48:28,952
If Septimus insists on sending a boy
to do a man's job...

511
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:30,053
No, no, no, wait, please!

512
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:32,032
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.

513
00:48:32,135 --> 00:48:34,935
Look at me, look at me.
I'm unarmed. Please.

514
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:37,436
Please, let me ride with you.

515
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:40,916
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

516
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,921
Well, then all the more reason
to take me with you.

517
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:46,519
There may come a time when you need
a second pair of hands. Sir?

518
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,262
Please. Maybe providence sent me
to you just as it sent you to me.

519
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:54,405
- Get on.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

520
00:49:19,528 --> 00:49:23,059
Goodness me, my dear.
Come in out of this wretched rain!

521
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,738
We have food and drink, a warm bed
and plenty of hot water for a bath.

522
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:51,017
How do you like your bath?
Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?

523
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:53,154
I honestly don't know.

524
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:54,661
Then let me choose for you,

525
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:57,964
and I'll have my husband
take your horse to the stable.

526
00:49:58,938 --> 00:50:00,066
Billy?

527
00:50:10,962 --> 00:50:14,230
Now, let's get you out
of your wet things, shall we?

528
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:27,027
Feeling better?

529
00:50:27,128 --> 00:50:28,858
Much. Thank you.

530
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:31,758
The warm water's actually done me
a world of good.

531
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,842
You see?
The powers of a nice, hot bath.

532
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,380
And your leg? Any improvement?

533
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:41,117
That is extraordinary.

534
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:45,357
It's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

535
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:47,330
You seem happier in yourself, too.

536
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:50,736
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

537
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:53,138
Wonderful.

538
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:57,145
Nothing like a nice soak
to warm the cockles of your heart.

539
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:08,472
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

540
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:12,071
but I've been told
I have a healer's hands.

541
00:51:13,218 --> 00:51:15,655
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

542
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,682
What's a massage?

543
00:51:17,794 --> 00:51:21,028
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

544
00:51:21,768 --> 00:51:25,902
Nothing like a massage to send you off
for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

545
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,478
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

546
00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:29,446
Lie on your back, dear.

547
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,459
Why not close your eyes?

548
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,897
You'll drift off better that way.

549
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:53,320
Hello!

550
00:51:55,434 --> 00:51:56,424
Service!

551
00:51:56,536 --> 00:51:59,063
Maybe we should carry on
and try the next inn,

552
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:01,907
especially if this stone is as close
as your runes say.

553
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:03,744
I'll give it one more try.

554
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,522
Relax here, my love.

555
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:12,999
I'll be back just as soon as
I've taken care of this customer.

556
00:52:18,112 --> 00:52:20,548
At last. We require accommodation.

557
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,987
Please help my friend
take the horses to the stables.

558
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:39,111
Hello!

559
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:42,960
Oh.

560
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,252
I'm accustomed to better service,

561
00:53:01,364 --> 00:53:04,233
but you're awake now
and that's what counts.

562
00:53:05,104 --> 00:53:06,437
Prepare your best room.

563
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:07,600
- She got the stone.
- Stone, stone.

564
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,878
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.

565
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:13,510
Glass of wine?

566
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:14,817
No, no, no, no, no.

567
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:16,715
No.

568
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,726
Until my brother is dead,
I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

569
00:53:23,874 --> 00:53:27,370
Though my friend in the stables
might be glad of a drop.

570
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,622
Your best room, perhaps?

571
00:53:33,226 --> 00:53:34,559
Of course.

572
00:53:41,777 --> 00:53:43,906
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

573
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:46,451
Traveling alone, are you?

574
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:51,326
I've just stabled my four black stallions
and my carriage.

575
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:54,560
Well, I say mine.
It belonged to my late father.

576
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:09,792
Thank you.

577
00:54:09,898 --> 00:54:14,202
That's so kind, thank you very much.
My name's Tristan. What's yours?

578
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:15,536
Bernard.

579
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,489
There was not a horse or beast
he could not master.

580
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:29,331
So much so that in his youth,
he took to riding a camel,

581
00:54:29,437 --> 00:54:30,803
which was comical.

582
00:54:30,906 --> 00:54:33,001
When he passed,
the carriage came to me.

583
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,135
She's got the stone!

584
00:54:34,246 --> 00:54:35,236
- She's got it!
- She's got it!

585
00:54:35,348 --> 00:54:38,617
And it's the largest in all of Stormhold,
so they say.

586
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:41,488
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

587
00:54:41,593 --> 00:54:42,687
Wait.

588
00:54:43,397 --> 00:54:45,390
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

589
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,095
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

590
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:48,173
- Well done.
- Sweet.

591
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:49,264
Come here. Let me see it.

592
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:04,327
You have no idea
what you're meddling with.

593
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:10,246
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold
and I demand that you bring it to me!

594
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,842
Bring me the stone! Now!

595
00:55:11,954 --> 00:55:15,085
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything
they give you! They tried to...

596
00:55:31,158 --> 00:55:33,390
- Are you all right?
- Billy!

597
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:36,694
Get him!

598
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:17,747
The burning golden heart
of a star at peace

599
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:20,878
is so much better
than your frightened little heart.

600
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:24,929
Even so, better than no heart at all.

601
00:56:26,934 --> 00:56:29,633
Yvaine?
Hold me tight and think of home.

602
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:40,486
No!

603
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:03,371
- What the hell did you do?
- What did I do? What did you do?

604
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:06,376
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

605
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:08,539
You thought of your home
and I thought of mine

606
00:57:08,649 --> 00:57:10,516
and now we're halfway between the two!

607
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,682
Oh, you stupid cow!
What did you think of your home for?

608
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,227
You just said "home"!

609
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:18,665
If you wanted me to think of your home,
you should have said!

610
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,206
Some crazy lady
was going to cut your heart out

611
00:57:21,308 --> 00:57:23,038
and you wanted
more specific instructions?

612
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:26,549
Perhaps you'd like it in writing!
Or a diagram, maybe!

613
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:38,738
Look, Captain Shakespeare!
Caught ourselves a little bonus!

614
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:41,643
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

615
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:48,585
They don't look
like Lightning Marshals to me.

616
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:51,791
Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?

617
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:55,101
"Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?"

618
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,971
Well, let's think.

619
00:57:57,078 --> 00:58:00,346
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason
we are!

620
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:02,646
Now, who are you?

621
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:07,760
Let's see if a night on our lovely brig
will loosen their lips!

622
00:58:07,866 --> 00:58:10,804
- Get them in the brig!
- You heard the man! Let's go!

623
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:15,676
Get them into the brig and the rest of
you dirty dogs, back to work!

624
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:18,378
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

625
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,170
- They're going to kill us, aren't they?
- I don't know.

626
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:51,716
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

627
00:58:53,121 --> 00:58:55,854
I used to watch people
having adventures.

628
00:58:57,964 --> 00:58:59,456
I envied them.

629
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,942
You ever heard the expression,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

630
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:06,742
What? So ending up with my heart
cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

631
00:59:06,848 --> 00:59:09,877
No. No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

632
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:14,021
Look, I admire you dreaming.

633
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:17,402
Shop boy like me,

634
00:59:17,502 --> 00:59:19,404
I could never have imagined
an adventure this big

635
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:21,772
in order to have wished for it.

636
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:25,082
I just thought
I'd find some lump of celestial rock

637
00:59:25,184 --> 00:59:27,781
and take it home, and that would be it.

638
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:29,221
And you got me.

639
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:41,572
If there's one thing I've learned
in all my years watching Earth,

640
00:59:41,683 --> 00:59:44,484
it's that people aren't
what they may seem.

641
00:59:45,224 --> 00:59:46,249
There are shop boys

642
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:50,629
and there are boys who just happen
to work in shops for the time being.

643
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:54,731
And trust me, Tristan,
you're no shop boy.

644
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,645
You saved my life. Thank you.

645
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:06,222
Well, well, well.

646
01:00:06,866 --> 01:00:08,698
The last brother dead.

647
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,467
Which means that I'm king.

648
01:00:16,552 --> 01:00:17,781
I'm king!

649
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,354
Not yet, brother.

650
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:25,829
Damn. I still need the stone.

651
01:00:27,072 --> 01:00:30,842
- Your brother doesn't have it?
- Well, why don't you find out?

652
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,728
Where is my stone?

653
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:44,567
I don't...

654
01:00:44,673 --> 01:00:47,577
The man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.

655
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,583
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

656
01:00:50,685 --> 01:00:52,587
- What girl?
- I don't know.

657
01:00:52,689 --> 01:00:55,387
A girl. She got away.
Because this was a trap set up for her,

658
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:58,558
but your brother,
he come just straight into it.

659
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:00,934
A trap? Set by who?

660
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:03,141
A woman you should pray
you'll never meet.

661
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:04,438
She's...

662
01:01:05,414 --> 01:01:08,284
She's gone.
She took your brother's carriage.

663
01:01:08,387 --> 01:01:10,482
This woman wanted my stone?

664
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:12,993
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

665
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:17,400
She said the girl was a star and
she wanted to cut out her heart and...

666
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,238
Eat it?

667
01:01:23,015 --> 01:01:24,381
Oh, my God.

668
01:01:25,955 --> 01:01:28,517
Do you have any idea what this means?

669
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,457
Everlasting life.

670
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:34,828
King forever.

671
01:01:38,981 --> 01:01:40,540
It's not here, sire.

672
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:42,745
This idiot's coming with us.

673
01:02:07,202 --> 01:02:09,263
- Ask again.
- We have asked again

674
01:02:09,373 --> 01:02:11,673
and the answer is still the same.
She is airborne!

675
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:13,077
Well, she can't remain so forever.

676
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:15,151
Inform me
as soon as she touches ground!

677
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:17,153
Lmmediately! Do you understand?

678
01:02:17,256 --> 01:02:20,820
Watch your tongue, sister!
It is you and not we who've lost her.

679
01:02:20,929 --> 01:02:22,796
Lost her and broken the knife!

680
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,872
Even if you apprehend her,
how will you complete the deed?

681
01:02:25,973 --> 01:02:29,343
Perhaps you should return now
and one of us set out in your place.

682
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:30,641
Don't be absurd.

683
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:33,618
I'll bring her home
and deal with her there.

684
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:36,591
Be sure everything is ready
for our arrival.

685
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,569
Tell me about Victoria then.

686
01:02:49,218 --> 01:02:50,847
Well, she...

687
01:02:54,428 --> 01:02:57,025
There's nothing more to tell you.

688
01:02:57,134 --> 01:03:02,668
Because the little I know about love
is that it's unconditional.

689
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,815
It's not something you can buy.

690
01:03:05,918 --> 01:03:08,787
Hang on.
This wasn't about me buying her love.

691
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,657
This was a way for me
to prove how I felt.

692
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:19,407
And what's she doing to prove
how she feels about you?

693
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:20,668
Well...

694
01:03:25,085 --> 01:03:28,889
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand
when you meet her. All right?

695
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:32,456
Provided we don't get murdered
by pirates first.

696
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:38,603
Murdered by pirates.
Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

697
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:41,512
I can't quite decide
which sounds more fun.

698
01:03:44,055 --> 01:03:46,288
We've located the sky vessel.

699
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:48,990
It's headed north
for the port town on Mount Drummond

700
01:03:49,098 --> 01:03:52,434
and you are no longer
the only one seeking the star.

701
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:54,508
There's someone following your tracks!

702
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,705
A witch? A warlock?

703
01:03:56,814 --> 01:03:59,945
A prince and he's catching you up!
Get a move on!

704
01:04:27,474 --> 01:04:33,783
So, this is the part where you tell me
who you are and why you're up here.

705
01:04:34,588 --> 01:04:39,826
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers
one by one like dry twigs!

706
01:04:42,136 --> 01:04:44,163
My name is Tristan Thorn.

707
01:04:44,474 --> 01:04:47,001
- This is my wife, Yvaine.
- Your wife?

708
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,380
Far too young and radiant
to belong to just one man!

709
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:55,627
It's share and share alike
aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

710
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,156
If you dare even touch her...

711
01:04:58,268 --> 01:05:00,967
You may think you're showing
a little spirit in front of your lady friend,

712
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:03,910
but if you talk back to me again,
I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

713
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:06,074
you impertinent little pup!

714
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:09,854
- Sir?
- Better! But still interrupting.

715
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:13,795
Let's see.
A hanging's always good for morale!

716
01:05:13,898 --> 01:05:16,392
Maybe we'll watch you dance
a gallows jig!

717
01:05:18,475 --> 01:05:22,437
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side
and have done with it!

718
01:05:23,183 --> 01:05:25,085
It's a very long way down.

719
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,591
Plenty of time to reminisce
about your pitifully short lives.

720
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:31,632
Please, look, we're just trying
to make our way home,

721
01:05:31,733 --> 01:05:33,066
back to a place called Wall,
where I come from.

722
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:34,695
What did you say?

723
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:36,901
I said we were trying to get home
to Wall.

724
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,912
That's one lie too many, my son.

725
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:39,982
- Wall?
- Shut up.

726
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:41,051
What's he saying?

727
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:44,056
Thought you could just wander
onto my patch, did you?

728
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:45,593
- He is. Yeah, he's gonna...
- And live to tell the tale?

729
01:05:45,694 --> 01:05:48,187
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck,
on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

730
01:05:48,299 --> 01:05:52,741
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn!
And the last one you'll ever make!

731
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:02,892
- No! No! You brute!
- Come... Come on!

732
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:06,126
- You murderer! You pig!
- Come on! Get up! Get up!

733
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:09,837
I'm taking the girl to my cabin,
and mark my words,

734
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:11,673
anyone who disturbs me
for the next few hours

735
01:06:11,779 --> 01:06:13,646
- will get the same treatment!
- What? You'll...

736
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:16,379
No, you idiot!
I'll sling you over the side as well!

737
01:06:16,488 --> 01:06:17,751
Oh, yeah.

738
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,498
Captain's busy. So should you be.

739
01:06:26,138 --> 01:06:27,903
Get in there, wench!

740
01:06:33,986 --> 01:06:36,617
So, that went well, I thought.

741
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:41,730
Now, tell me news
of my beloved England.

742
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,432
I want to hear absolutely everything.

743
01:06:45,743 --> 01:06:48,738
Hang on.
I can't believe your crew fell for that.

744
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:51,285
And where in God's name
did you get that mannequin from?

745
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,084
Oh, it works every time.

746
01:06:53,191 --> 01:06:55,423
An ounce of bargaining,
a pinch of trickery,

747
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:58,057
a soupcon of intimidation, et voila!

748
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:00,263
The perfect recipe
for a towering reputation

749
01:07:00,372 --> 01:07:02,842
without ever having to spill
one drop of blood.

750
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:06,348
Ever try to get blood stains out
of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

751
01:07:06,451 --> 01:07:09,912
Right. I still don't understand
how they won't recognize me.

752
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:11,014
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

753
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,094
your own mother won't recognize you.

754
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,185
Now, we've no time to waste.

755
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:15,164
We have only two hours
before we make port.

756
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:16,964
First and foremost...

757
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:24,243
It'll be so good to see you
out of those dreary clothes.

758
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:27,620
So very small-town errand-boy.
Howlingly parochial.

759
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:31,559
Here. Tres you.

760
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:34,865
I wore it as a younger man.
I hate to throw anything away.

761
01:07:34,973 --> 01:07:36,567
You know the day you do,
it'll come back in fashion,

762
01:07:36,676 --> 01:07:38,578
be oh, so de la mode.

763
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,080
Now, you, darling.

764
01:07:40,183 --> 01:07:41,880
I have some lovely dresses.
Take your pick.

765
01:07:41,987 --> 01:07:43,456
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

766
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,925
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

767
01:07:47,899 --> 01:07:51,565
Now, England, England.
I want to hear everything.

768
01:07:52,307 --> 01:07:54,504
- You're not from England.
- Oh, no, sadly, no.

769
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:56,912
But from my earliest youth,
I lapped up the stories.

770
01:07:57,017 --> 01:07:58,747
People always told me they were
nothing more than folklore,

771
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:01,347
but my heart told me they were true.

772
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:03,656
As a boy, I'd scurry away
from my father at the market

773
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:06,633
while he did his deals
just to peek over the wall,

774
01:08:06,735 --> 01:08:09,730
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day,
seeing England for myself.

775
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:12,244
Really? So you...
You were here looking over there.

776
01:08:12,346 --> 01:08:13,576
Oh, yes.

777
01:08:15,118 --> 01:08:17,486
- Hair.
- Hair?

778
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,993
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

779
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,363
Tried to make my father,
Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

780
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:25,871
Forged a decent reputation
as a ruthless marauder

781
01:08:25,974 --> 01:08:27,944
and cold-blooded killer.

782
01:08:28,345 --> 01:08:30,076
But my father died.

783
01:08:30,883 --> 01:08:33,081
I always promised him
I'd take over the family business,

784
01:08:33,188 --> 01:08:35,158
keep the old girl flying.

785
01:08:36,194 --> 01:08:38,095
You have no idea the lightness
it brings to my heart

786
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,226
being able to confide in you
charming young people.

787
01:08:41,336 --> 01:08:43,671
The pressure of maintaining the
whole Captain Shakespeare persona

788
01:08:43,775 --> 01:08:45,768
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

789
01:08:45,879 --> 01:08:47,404
Sometimes...

790
01:08:47,515 --> 01:08:50,487
You see, I'm very much
a man of my own creation.

791
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:53,458
Even chose the name specially.
Took me ages.

792
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,656
See, I'm thinking
legendary British wordsmith.

793
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:58,794
My enemies and crew are thinking,
"Shake! Spear!"

794
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,602
It's little things like that make me happy.

795
01:09:01,944 --> 01:09:04,005
I don't understand that.

796
01:09:04,114 --> 01:09:06,915
Surely it would make you happier
just to be yourself.

797
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:10,322
Why fight to be accepted by people
you don't actually want to be like?

798
01:09:10,428 --> 01:09:13,457
Yeah.
Why would anyone do that to himself?

799
01:09:14,769 --> 01:09:15,998
Exactly.

800
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:22,949
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

801
01:09:36,746 --> 01:09:38,009
Hurry up.

802
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:49,970
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh.
I'll be honest.

803
01:09:50,072 --> 01:09:52,099
Shall I give you a little taste,
young Ferdinand?

804
01:09:52,209 --> 01:09:53,974
No, no. Oh, there you go.

805
01:09:56,584 --> 01:09:58,315
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

806
01:09:58,422 --> 01:10:02,362
I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still tres fresh.

807
01:10:02,663 --> 01:10:05,260
- So, name your best price.
- For 10,000 bolts?

808
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,805
Ten thousand bolts
of finest quality grade A.

809
01:10:07,907 --> 01:10:10,777
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift,
isn't it? Difficult to store.

810
01:10:10,879 --> 01:10:14,113
If I get the Revenue Men in here
sniffing round, what's the...

811
01:10:14,219 --> 01:10:15,984
Best price, 150 guineas.

812
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:16,557
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

813
01:10:16,557 --> 01:10:18,424
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

814
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:19,826
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

815
01:10:19,964 --> 01:10:21,694
Hold on. Hold on. One minute.
Hold on, cuddles.

816
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,667
- Oh, he's...
- One-sixty. One-sixty.

817
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:25,707
Seeing as I'm feeling
particularly generous today,

818
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:27,072
I'll settle for 200.

819
01:10:27,178 --> 01:10:30,207
Two hundred? Okay.
You're having a laugh.

820
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:31,581
Have you had your head in that?

821
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:34,750
Has he been sailing up
where the air's too thin?

822
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:38,859
- You're being very rude.
- Not anymore.

823
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,801
- Two hundred.
- One-eighty.

824
01:10:41,907 --> 01:10:43,341
- Two hundred.
- That's not negotiation.

825
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:45,744
I'm changing my number.
One-eight-five.

826
01:10:45,848 --> 01:10:48,284
- Did I hear 200?
- From you, you did. Yeah.

827
01:10:48,386 --> 01:10:51,187
- You said 200.
- Lf I did, you're a ventriloquist.

828
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,353
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

829
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,795
One-nine-five it is.
So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.

830
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,103
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

831
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,673
Unbelievable. Here.

832
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:09,889
Yes? Can I help you?

833
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:13,026
Nosy.

834
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,737
Have you heard any of these rumors
going round about a fallen star?

835
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:18,243
Everyone's talking about it.

836
01:11:18,345 --> 01:11:21,647
You get your hands on one of them,
we can shut up shop. Retire.

837
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:23,448
- Fallen star?
- Yeah.

838
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,197
- Nothing on your travels?
- No.

839
01:11:31,304 --> 01:11:32,533
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

840
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,337
Everyone's going on about it
down at the market.

841
01:11:34,444 --> 01:11:35,707
Which market?
The market near the wall?

842
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:36,781
Yeah.

843
01:11:36,882 --> 01:11:38,647
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time
listening to gossip

844
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,688
from the kind of pond scum
trading down there.

845
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:43,123
- Well, if it...
- Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

846
01:11:43,227 --> 01:11:44,958
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

847
01:11:45,064 --> 01:11:47,364
Oh, what a wonderful woman
you are, Sal.

848
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,166
How the world wouldn't be
the same place without you.

849
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:50,936
You look great.
You've had your feet done, haven't you?

850
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:55,143
But, you two, you have business
to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

851
01:11:55,251 --> 01:11:57,949
Come on.
I've got something new for you.

852
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:06,367
Captain Shakespeare.

853
01:12:06,774 --> 01:12:08,072
Stand down!

854
01:12:08,176 --> 01:12:09,873
Meet my nephew,
the fearsome buccaneer,

855
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,471
Tristan Thorn.

856
01:12:11,817 --> 01:12:14,344
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

857
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:17,860
I have the perfect gift
to keep you amused on the way.

858
01:12:24,742 --> 01:12:25,767
Oh...

859
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:33,559
Right, you lazy dogs!

860
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:36,324
Let's get young Tristan
on his way home!

861
01:14:28,652 --> 01:14:29,847
Touche.

862
01:14:30,523 --> 01:14:32,014
I'm impressed.

863
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:50,086
Yvaine, I know what you are.

864
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:55,427
No, no. Have no fear.

865
01:14:55,939 --> 01:15:00,107
No one on this vessel will harm you,
but there are plenty who would.

866
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:07,255
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine.
You must learn to control them.

867
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:09,662
You've been glowing
more brightly every day,

868
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:11,201
and I think you know why.

869
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:14,070
Of course I know why I'm glowing.
I'm a star.

870
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:18,205
- And what do stars do best?
- Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

871
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:30,668
- Now try.
- Okay.

872
01:15:34,147 --> 01:15:35,878
- See?
- Very good.

873
01:15:51,181 --> 01:15:52,581
Due west, you say?

874
01:15:52,684 --> 01:15:54,016
And you're certain
he had a girl with him?

875
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,110
Yeah.

876
01:15:55,223 --> 01:15:58,525
You're sure? Absolutely sure?
Sure you're not lying?

877
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,329
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

878
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,298
- Brilliant.
- You'd better be telling the truth,

879
01:16:04,407 --> 01:16:05,671
you two-faced dog.

880
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:08,749
I can get you one of them, actually.
Very good guard dogs.

881
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:11,012
They can watch the back
and the front door at the same time.

882
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,088
I can get you anything you want.

883
01:16:12,189 --> 01:16:14,854
What are the chances of getting
a Babylon candle?

884
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:16,395
That one's slim.

885
01:16:16,497 --> 01:16:20,961
Although, I did know a girl once,
if you know what I mean...

886
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:22,166
I'm a ladies' man.

887
01:16:22,276 --> 01:16:23,676
...who had a sister...

888
01:16:23,778 --> 01:16:24,837
I think it was a woman.

889
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,682
Oh, she was terrible.
Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

890
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:29,983
Enough.

891
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:50,023
Hold on tight!
The Captain's at the helm!

892
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,333
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

893
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,934
Good luck on your journey home,
Yvaine, wherever that may be.

894
01:17:49,045 --> 01:17:52,017
And good luck to you, Tristan,
with your Victoria.

895
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:54,619
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough
for your kindness?

896
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:58,322
Don't mention it.
No, seriously, don't mention it.

897
01:17:58,431 --> 01:18:02,461
Reputations, you know.
A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

898
01:18:04,877 --> 01:18:07,815
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

899
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:12,753
Just think about it.

900
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:20,939
Well, give my regards to England.
It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

901
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:27,684
Mind you don't wear that wench out,
Captain Tristan!

902
01:18:32,397 --> 01:18:34,299
What did he say to you?

903
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:36,465
What did he say when?

904
01:18:36,572 --> 01:18:39,066
Just then. When he whispered to you.

905
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,983
No... No, he... He was just saying
we should use the lightning

906
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:45,318
to get you a Babylon candle.

907
01:18:45,423 --> 01:18:47,359
Barter for it, you know.

908
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:52,127
For the last time, where is the girl?

909
01:18:53,506 --> 01:18:56,272
The girl with the stone!
Where did she go?

910
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,509
- Are you mocking me?
- No...

911
01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:03,113
'Cause if you are, believe me,
you have seconds to live!

912
01:19:08,101 --> 01:19:09,535
What a freak.

913
01:19:09,872 --> 01:19:12,399
Clean this thoroughly.

914
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:21,924
Bollocks.

915
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,898
If you have quite finished
squandering your magic

916
01:19:27,005 --> 01:19:29,499
on your rather
counterproductive beauty routine,

917
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,876
you might like to know that
the star has returned.

918
01:19:31,981 --> 01:19:33,347
She's back on land.

919
01:19:33,450 --> 01:19:36,821
I know, damn it.
I couldn't reach the lake in time.

920
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:41,298
No matter. We have found her.
She is on the road to the village of Wall.

921
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,927
If you take the shortcut
across the marshes,

922
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:45,905
you should arrive in time
to intercept her.

923
01:19:54,893 --> 01:19:56,122
Yvaine.

924
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,065
- Are you trying to break my leg again?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

925
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:05,112
I just... I can't risk people seeing you.
I don't trust anyone.

926
01:20:05,213 --> 01:20:06,876
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

927
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:11,949
Yvaine. We're making good time.
Just leave it a minute.

928
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,671
Aren't you tempted?

929
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:25,514
Tempted? By what?

930
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,724
Lmmortality.

931
01:20:29,762 --> 01:20:31,629
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

932
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:35,501
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

933
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:39,908
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

934
01:20:44,022 --> 01:20:48,396
I mean, even if I could...
Everlasting life?

935
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:53,098
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.

936
01:20:55,345 --> 01:20:56,438
Well,

937
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,017
maybe if you had someone
to share it with.

938
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,786
Someone you love.

939
01:21:04,196 --> 01:21:06,598
Maybe then it might be different.

940
01:21:09,806 --> 01:21:11,935
Come on, I think we're safe.

941
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:37,788
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare
has a fearsome reputation.

942
01:23:06,135 --> 01:23:08,731
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

943
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,935
My name is Prince Septimus.

944
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:14,947
And you're going to tell me
where I can find the girl.

945
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:27,677
All right, twinkletoes.
I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

946
01:23:44,043 --> 01:23:48,712
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes.
I just noticed it. Is it normal?

947
01:23:48,819 --> 01:23:51,916
Let's see if you can work it out
for yourself.

948
01:23:52,025 --> 01:23:53,824
What do stars do?

949
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:57,027
Attract trouble?

950
01:23:59,139 --> 01:24:01,439
That's... All right, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm sorry.

951
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:03,104
All right, let me... Let me...
Do I get another guess?

952
01:24:04,283 --> 01:24:08,314
Is it... Do they know exactly how
to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

953
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:15,867
- How long will that take?
- Maybe two days.

954
01:24:15,972 --> 01:24:19,707
But we don't have two days.
Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

955
01:24:20,482 --> 01:24:23,579
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

956
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:32,764
- Nice cup of Earl Grey.
- Get out, everybody. Get out.

957
01:24:32,873 --> 01:24:34,842
Did he hurt you, Captain?

958
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:39,882
Did you tell him
where your nephew and the girl went?

959
01:24:40,954 --> 01:24:42,787
So what's the problem?

960
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,757
It's my reputation.

961
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:49,534
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

962
01:24:49,639 --> 01:24:51,471
It's all right, Captain.

963
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,681
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

964
01:24:57,988 --> 01:25:01,688
- You'll always be our captain, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

965
01:25:07,173 --> 01:25:08,141
Captain.

966
01:25:08,242 --> 01:25:10,235
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

967
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:19,293
Prince Septimus,
your men, they're dead.

968
01:25:19,396 --> 01:25:20,763
Oh, really?

969
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:23,831
Go on!

970
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:39,834
I met that woman.
She's friends with the Captain.

971
01:25:39,937 --> 01:25:41,634
He said she trades at the market
near Wall.

972
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:43,734
- We could hitch a lift.
- Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

973
01:25:43,845 --> 01:25:45,074
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

974
01:25:45,949 --> 01:25:49,719
Wait! Sorry!
My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

975
01:25:49,823 --> 01:25:51,451
That's my flower.

976
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:55,257
Eighteen years
I've been looking for that.

977
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:56,996
Give it to me now!

978
01:25:57,738 --> 01:26:00,801
How dare you?
That was a gift from his mother!

979
01:26:00,912 --> 01:26:01,879
Oh.

980
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:04,315
Perhaps I was mistaken.

981
01:26:05,621 --> 01:26:07,147
It's all right.

982
01:26:07,692 --> 01:26:09,787
It's obviously very valuable to you,
so you can have it

983
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:11,422
in exchange for what I need.

984
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,594
- A Babylon candle?
- And safe passage to the wall.

985
01:26:13,704 --> 01:26:15,537
A Babylon candle?

986
01:26:15,641 --> 01:26:19,581
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't deal in black magic.

987
01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:20,877
Really?

988
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:23,989
Well, can you give us a lift then?
To the wall?

989
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:27,120
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

990
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:31,934
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

991
01:26:32,207 --> 01:26:34,370
- Food and lodging on the way?
- Safe passage.

992
01:26:34,478 --> 01:26:36,812
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

993
01:26:36,915 --> 01:26:39,978
in the exact same condition
that you're in now.

994
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,196
Do you have any idea what
manner of thing it was that you had?

995
01:26:48,304 --> 01:26:50,297
Some kind of lucky charm?

996
01:26:50,777 --> 01:26:54,011
A very lucky charm indeed. Protection.

997
01:26:54,851 --> 01:26:59,622
In fact, the exact same thing that
would've prevented me from doing this.

998
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:06,734
- Oh, my God! What did you do?
- Much better.

999
01:27:06,841 --> 01:27:10,645
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

1000
01:27:11,016 --> 01:27:14,547
Though I'll keep me word.
You shall not be harmed.

1001
01:27:23,507 --> 01:27:27,106
There.
Food and lodging just as I promised.

1002
01:27:27,215 --> 01:27:31,349
Would I be correct in thinking that
you can neither see nor hear me?

1003
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:34,489
Then I'd like to tell you
that you smell of pee.

1004
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:36,361
You look like the wrong end of a dog.

1005
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:38,936
And I swear,
if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1006
01:27:39,037 --> 01:27:41,200
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1007
01:28:00,446 --> 01:28:01,641
Tristan?

1008
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:06,019
If you can understand me,
look at me now.

1009
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,575
You know when I said
I knew little about love?

1010
01:28:39,323 --> 01:28:41,224
Well, that wasn't true.

1011
01:28:43,765 --> 01:28:45,701
I know a lot about love.

1012
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:49,910
I've seen it.
I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1013
01:28:51,714 --> 01:28:55,676
And it was the only thing that made
watching your world bearable.

1014
01:28:56,891 --> 01:29:02,357
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1015
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:07,808
Made me want to turn away
and never look down again.

1016
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:13,754
But to see the way that mankind loves.

1017
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,693
I mean, you could search
the furthest reaches of the universe

1018
01:29:17,799 --> 01:29:20,634
and never find anything more beautiful.

1019
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:28,952
So, yes, I know that
love is unconditional.

1020
01:29:30,590 --> 01:29:34,394
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1021
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:41,004
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1022
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:47,081
and, well,
strangely easy to mistake for loathing.

1023
01:29:47,858 --> 01:29:48,826
And

1024
01:29:51,197 --> 01:29:55,604
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1025
01:29:57,276 --> 01:29:59,007
I think I love you.

1026
01:30:00,115 --> 01:30:05,820
My heart, it feels like
my chest can barely contain it.

1027
01:30:07,663 --> 01:30:13,106
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore.
It belongs to you.

1028
01:30:14,644 --> 01:30:18,880
And if you wanted it,
I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1029
01:30:20,188 --> 01:30:25,153
No gifts, no goods,
no demonstrations of devotion.

1030
01:30:28,204 --> 01:30:30,800
Nothing but knowing you love me, too.

1031
01:30:32,745 --> 01:30:34,271
Just your heart

1032
01:30:36,353 --> 01:30:38,049
in exchange for mine.

1033
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,739
The wall is one mile that way.

1034
01:30:50,547 --> 01:30:54,248
There. Though the walk might take
you a little longer than normal.

1035
01:30:54,355 --> 01:30:58,455
Transformation tends to leave the brain
a bit scrambled for a while.

1036
01:31:01,936 --> 01:31:03,269
You...

1037
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:04,496
Oh!

1038
01:31:05,744 --> 01:31:08,112
I warned you. Save your strength.

1039
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:11,349
I've been so worried about you.

1040
01:31:12,023 --> 01:31:13,252
Victoria.

1041
01:31:14,294 --> 01:31:16,355
I think I preferred "Mother."

1042
01:31:18,268 --> 01:31:22,834
Come on. There's an inn over there.
Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1043
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:25,348
I think you need a bath
and a good night's sleep

1044
01:31:25,449 --> 01:31:27,715
before you present me to her.

1045
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,449
Come on. Come.

1046
01:31:31,828 --> 01:31:34,732
- Come on, Tristan. It's not that far.
- Okay.

1047
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:57,973
- Excuse me?
- Oh!

1048
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,314
- I think you're in my bath.
- Well, close your eyes!

1049
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:06,990
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking.
Here, I'll turn away.

1050
01:32:11,974 --> 01:32:14,342
All right, you can open them now.

1051
01:32:22,094 --> 01:32:25,225
Did you really mean
what you said in the caravan?

1052
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:28,534
What I...

1053
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,669
But... But you were a mouse!

1054
01:32:32,113 --> 01:32:35,279
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese!
You didn't...

1055
01:32:35,387 --> 01:32:37,219
I asked you to give me a sign.

1056
01:32:37,323 --> 01:32:41,491
And risk you being too embarrassed
to keep saying such lovely things?

1057
01:32:46,843 --> 01:32:50,407
You want to know what the Captain
really whispered to me that day?

1058
01:32:52,754 --> 01:32:57,355
He told me that my true love
was right in front of my eyes.

1059
01:32:59,567 --> 01:33:01,195
And he was right.

1060
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,904
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on,
you got to come up and see this!

1061
01:33:19,006 --> 01:33:20,440
No, thank you.

1062
01:33:21,177 --> 01:33:23,238
- Pervert!
- Suit yourself.

1063
01:33:25,218 --> 01:33:28,622
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Yeah. What is?

1064
01:33:29,259 --> 01:33:31,320
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1065
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:35,199
find the girl, get the stone
and be king forever.

1066
01:33:35,304 --> 01:33:36,637
So unjust.

1067
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:39,542
Still, at least we will be free.

1068
01:33:42,318 --> 01:33:45,654
You're very close.
She's in the market town.

1069
01:33:45,758 --> 01:33:48,058
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1070
01:33:48,163 --> 01:33:50,224
You speak as if this is good news.

1071
01:33:50,334 --> 01:33:54,274
Do I need to remind you that Wall
is not part of our universe?

1072
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:56,937
If she crosses the threshold
into the human realm,

1073
01:33:57,046 --> 01:34:01,077
our star becomes nothing more
than a pitted lump of metallic rock.

1074
01:34:01,589 --> 01:34:03,991
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1075
01:34:35,188 --> 01:34:36,349
What?

1076
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:38,520
Oh, what do you want?

1077
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:41,760
Sorry.
Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1078
01:34:41,868 --> 01:34:44,737
Ask me again
at a more reasonable hour.

1079
01:34:44,841 --> 01:34:45,934
No, I can't. I have to go.

1080
01:34:46,043 --> 01:34:48,275
Look,
if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1081
01:34:48,381 --> 01:34:50,851
- please, can you give her a message?
- Go on.

1082
01:35:27,491 --> 01:35:31,123
You know, that's the first time
I've ever slept at night.

1083
01:35:32,468 --> 01:35:34,164
I can't believe it.

1084
01:35:38,546 --> 01:35:39,536
Tristan?

1085
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:50,598
Have you seen my friend?

1086
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:52,605
He left absurdly early.

1087
01:35:53,809 --> 01:35:55,038
He left?

1088
01:35:55,145 --> 01:35:58,380
He told me to tell you
he's gone to see Victoria

1089
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:01,390
because he's sorry,
but he's found his true love

1090
01:36:01,492 --> 01:36:04,623
and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her.

1091
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:06,793
What?

1092
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,274
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

1093
01:36:39,733 --> 01:36:42,602
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1094
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,749
Happy birthday.

1095
01:37:28,729 --> 01:37:30,027
Tristan.

1096
01:37:32,002 --> 01:37:33,767
What happened to you?

1097
01:37:35,175 --> 01:37:36,804
I found the star.

1098
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:40,852
I can't believe you did it.

1099
01:37:40,954 --> 01:37:43,424
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1100
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,587
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes.

1101
01:37:48,835 --> 01:37:50,805
Well, it's awfully small.

1102
01:37:51,774 --> 01:37:54,803
Well, that's just a little piece.
A token for your birthday.

1103
01:37:54,914 --> 01:37:57,715
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1104
01:37:59,022 --> 01:38:01,219
It's not the star that I want.

1105
01:38:03,665 --> 01:38:05,429
You know what I want.

1106
01:38:07,638 --> 01:38:09,471
Yeah. I do.

1107
01:38:14,753 --> 01:38:18,693
You want to grow up
and get over yourself.

1108
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:25,132
- Humphrey.
- Thorn.

1109
01:38:25,674 --> 01:38:27,769
You must have a death wish.

1110
01:38:35,795 --> 01:38:38,595
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1111
01:38:39,234 --> 01:38:40,897
She's all yours.

1112
01:38:41,005 --> 01:38:43,567
You really are a perfect couple.
The best of luck to you both.

1113
01:38:43,676 --> 01:38:48,311
Well, why would I want this?
It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1114
01:38:53,863 --> 01:38:54,990
Yvaine?

1115
01:38:57,136 --> 01:38:59,072
She can't cross the wall.

1116
01:39:07,824 --> 01:39:08,849
Go on!

1117
01:40:16,425 --> 01:40:19,363
Stop! Stop!
If you go through there, you'll die!

1118
01:40:19,465 --> 01:40:20,524
What?

1119
01:40:22,704 --> 01:40:25,904
If you set foot on human soil,
you'll turn to rock.

1120
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,974
Wretched slattern!
Where have you taken me?

1121
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:41,830
Planning to enter Wall, were you?

1122
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:46,349
If death is what you wish, my dear,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1123
01:40:46,685 --> 01:40:48,587
Are you talking to me?

1124
01:40:49,324 --> 01:40:50,952
You. Small world.

1125
01:40:51,961 --> 01:40:55,297
Anyhow, no, I wasn't.
I was talking to the star.

1126
01:40:55,803 --> 01:40:57,101
What star?

1127
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:02,342
My slave girl's no star.
Any fool can see that.

1128
01:41:02,883 --> 01:41:05,513
If she was,
I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1129
01:41:05,621 --> 01:41:08,149
a long time ago, trust me.

1130
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:11,965
Trust you? Not a mistake
I'd be likely to make again.

1131
01:41:12,635 --> 01:41:16,039
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal?
Heads or tails?

1132
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:50,166
- Oh, God. Time to go.
- She's not going anywhere.

1133
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:52,176
I think you'll find she is.

1134
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,649
It's all right. You can come, too.

1135
01:41:57,558 --> 01:42:01,622
You can ride in the carriage or
be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1136
01:42:21,538 --> 01:42:22,836
What happened?

1137
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,274
Be my guest. I quit.

1138
01:42:25,378 --> 01:42:28,373
Eighty years
I've stopped you people going out.

1139
01:42:28,484 --> 01:42:30,351
What I should have been worrying about

1140
01:42:30,455 --> 01:42:31,947
was those people
from the other side coming in.

1141
01:42:32,058 --> 01:42:33,720
All right,
just tell me what happened!

1142
01:42:33,829 --> 01:42:35,695
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1143
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,036
No!

1144
01:42:52,064 --> 01:42:53,259
Come on!

1145
01:43:23,192 --> 01:43:24,319
Go on!

1146
01:43:54,988 --> 01:43:56,217
The star!

1147
01:43:56,825 --> 01:43:57,793
And who else?

1148
01:43:57,894 --> 01:44:01,025
A slave for us. It will be nice to
have someone to help mop up

1149
01:44:01,133 --> 01:44:03,330
when we've finished with our little guest.

1150
01:44:03,438 --> 01:44:04,838
Oh, good work, sister.

1151
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:07,844
And just in time, I see! You look awful!

1152
01:45:06,929 --> 01:45:08,330
Who are you?

1153
01:45:09,634 --> 01:45:11,934
What business do you have here?

1154
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:14,638
Septimus?

1155
01:45:15,178 --> 01:45:17,273
I knew your brother, Primus.

1156
01:45:18,619 --> 01:45:21,146
Unless you wish to meet him
in the afterlife,

1157
01:45:21,257 --> 01:45:23,922
I suggest you answer my question.
What are you doing here?

1158
01:45:24,029 --> 01:45:26,329
I might ask you the same thing.

1159
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,967
There are four of them.

1160
01:45:47,943 --> 01:45:50,676
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1161
01:45:50,782 --> 01:45:53,275
Wait.
How do I know you can be trusted?

1162
01:45:53,387 --> 01:45:55,984
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1163
01:45:56,092 --> 01:45:58,085
- No.
- Well, then, let's go.

1164
01:46:05,511 --> 01:46:09,109
Get off me! Get off!

1165
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,557
- Una?
- Septimus.

1166
01:46:15,664 --> 01:46:17,132
- Una!
- Sister!

1167
01:46:35,903 --> 01:46:37,770
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1168
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:41,709
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1169
01:46:42,951 --> 01:46:44,511
I'm your mother.

1170
01:47:21,259 --> 01:47:23,856
- Rather well.
- Good riddance to you. Yes.

1171
01:47:49,481 --> 01:47:50,449
Oh!

1172
01:48:03,509 --> 01:48:05,706
Let's put out those flames.

1173
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:07,446
Shall we?

1174
01:48:58,217 --> 01:49:00,084
So, what happens now?

1175
01:49:00,888 --> 01:49:03,291
We have to learn to live with each other.

1176
01:49:03,394 --> 01:49:04,589
Forever?

1177
01:49:10,106 --> 01:49:11,871
Let's get on with it.

1178
01:49:15,818 --> 01:49:17,811
Be the man that I know you are.

1179
01:49:35,623 --> 01:49:36,921
- Get outside.
- Okay.

1180
01:49:37,026 --> 01:49:38,016
Go.

1181
01:49:48,215 --> 01:49:50,082
- Tristan!
- Get him.

1182
01:50:25,788 --> 01:50:27,052
Get off!

1183
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,930
Get out!

1184
01:51:10,142 --> 01:51:14,607
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming?
Frog or tadpole?

1185
01:52:12,732 --> 01:52:13,961
Septimus?

1186
01:53:36,162 --> 01:53:37,323
Tristan!

1187
01:54:21,184 --> 01:54:22,482
Youth.

1188
01:54:23,422 --> 01:54:24,720
Beauty.

1189
01:54:26,528 --> 01:54:28,964
It all seems meaningless now.

1190
01:54:29,668 --> 01:54:31,638
My sisters are dead!

1191
01:54:33,274 --> 01:54:36,941
Everything I cared about gone.

1192
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:44,220
Go.

1193
01:54:49,707 --> 01:54:51,006
Go!

1194
01:55:12,051 --> 01:55:13,019
No!

1195
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:12,134
I owe you thanks, boy.

1196
01:56:12,569 --> 01:56:15,666
What use was her heart to me
when it was broken?

1197
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:21,017
And you got rid of my sisters
and now I can have it all for myself.

1198
01:56:26,898 --> 01:56:29,927
- Hold me tight and close your eyes.
- What? Why?

1199
01:56:30,705 --> 01:56:32,333
What do stars do?

1200
01:56:39,155 --> 01:56:40,316
Shine.

1201
01:57:16,595 --> 01:57:18,258
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

1202
01:57:18,666 --> 01:57:19,964
Very good.

1203
01:57:21,739 --> 01:57:23,265
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1204
01:57:23,376 --> 01:57:28,010
I couldn't have done that without you.
No star can shine with a broken heart.

1205
01:57:29,421 --> 01:57:31,287
I thought I'd lost you.

1206
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,358
But you came back.

1207
01:57:34,765 --> 01:57:37,065
Of course I did. I love you.

1208
01:57:42,646 --> 01:57:43,875
Come on.

1209
01:58:03,988 --> 01:58:05,286
Tristan.

1210
01:58:08,030 --> 01:58:11,525
The last surviving male heir
of the Stormhold bloodline.

1211
01:58:14,309 --> 01:58:15,937
It's you, Tristan.

1212
01:58:19,819 --> 01:58:22,814
But if he's the new King of Stormhold,
then...

1213
01:59:09,952 --> 01:59:14,450
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1214
01:59:31,861 --> 01:59:33,261
Yeah!

1215
01:59:49,195 --> 01:59:50,823
My gift to you.

1216
01:59:52,635 --> 01:59:54,035
To you both.

1217
01:59:54,338 --> 01:59:55,671
Thank you.

1218
02:00:10,637 --> 02:00:13,200
They ruled for 80 years.

1219
02:00:14,445 --> 02:00:17,383
But no man can live forever,

1220
02:00:18,286 --> 02:00:21,690
except he who possesses
the heart of a star.

1221
02:00:22,594 --> 02:00:27,001
And Yvaine had given hers
to Tristan completely.

1222
02:00:28,573 --> 02:00:31,875
When their children and grandchildren
were grown,

1223
02:00:32,914 --> 02:00:36,148
it was time to light the Babylon candle.

1224
02:00:42,233 --> 02:00:46,674
And they still live happily ever after.

1225
02:00:47,675 --> 02:01:02,690
THE END
