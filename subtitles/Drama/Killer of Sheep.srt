1
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,225
Oh, lulla-lulla-lulla
Lullaby bye,

2
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:48,292
Do you want the stars
to play with

3
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:52,230
or the moon
to run away with?

4
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,202
They'll come
if you don't cry.

5
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:59,852
So lulla-lulla-lulla
lullaby bye,

6
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,374
in your mother's arms
be sleeping.

7
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:07,538
You let anyone jump
on your brother again,

8
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:09,939
and you just stand
and watch,

9
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,532
boy, I'll beat you
to death

10
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:14,615
i don't care
who started what

11
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:17,944
or whether he was
winning or losing.

12
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,154
Boy, you get a stick
or-or-or-or-or

13
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:20,986
or a goddamned brick.

14
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:22,364
Get anything,
and you knock the shit

15
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,029
out of whoever's
fighting your brother,

16
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:29,761
' cause if anything was to happen
to me or your mother,

17
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,475
you ain't got nobody
except your brother.

18
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:34,820
And this goes for him too,

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,556
but he knows.

20
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:36,869
You' re the one
that keep coming up

21
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,886
with this off-the-wall
bullshit about

22
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:39,703
Henry started it.

23
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,614
Now, if the son of a bitch
is too big for you,

24
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:50,383
you come get me.

25
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:57,747
You are not
a child anymore.

26
00:01:57,747 --> 00:02:01,687
You soon
will be a goddamned man.

27
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,944
Now, start learning
what life is about now, son.

28
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:21,829
Oh, lulla-lulla-lulla
lullaby bye,

29
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,832
do you want the stars
to play with

30
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:30,122
or the moon
to run away with?

31
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:31,514
They'll come
if you don't cry.

32
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,196
stop right here.

33
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,391
Get him, get him, get him.

34
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,256
Get that mother.

35
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:49,056
You dirty little-

36
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,528
hey, man, quit bullshitting.

37
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,354
Damn

38
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,435
Hey, stop!

39
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:59,688
Can't you see
the man's hurt?

40
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:00,552
You old poop butt.

41
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,657
You all right?

42
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:11,920
Who hit him
with that rock, man?

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,041
Man, I didn't man.

44
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:13,649
Let me see, man.

45
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:14,866
Let me see
your sore, man.

46
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,242
Aw, that doesn't hurt.

47
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:16,819
You poop butt.

48
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,597
Hey, man, who you calling
a poop butt?

49
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:34,056
Hey, man, why don't we just
go to the Vicksburg-

50
00:05:34,056 --> 00:05:36,457
Hey, man, why don't we just
go to Vicksburg Club, man,

51
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,186
and watch the hos
go in and out?

52
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:38,860
Naw, man.

53
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,653
If anyone told ma
that they even saw me

54
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:43,215
on the same block
as the Vicksburg Club,

55
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,848
shoot, man, my ass is hers.

56
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:55,095
They'd have to call the police
to drag her off me.

57
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:56,016
Come on.

58
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,161
Hurry up.

59
00:05:59,161 --> 00:06:00,545
Come on, man

60
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:07,775
Stan Jr.,
where you going?

61
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,024
I'm going to get
my BB gun.

62
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:15,958
Push.

63
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,599
Push, you guys.

64
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,201
You ain't doing it. Push.

65
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:21,401
Hey, man, what you doing?

66
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:28,656
Hey, man, what you doing, man,
to my shoes?

67
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:00,964
Hey, you gone and broke

68
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,053
the motherfucking
antenna, man.

69
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:08,938
Oh, man, don't worry
about it.

70
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,090
What you looking at, punk?

71
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll kick your heart out.

72
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,124
Man, let's get on, man.

73
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:27,382
You ain't seen nothin'.

74
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,880
Man, black gone
and called the police, man.

75
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,649
Hey, man, I just-

76
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,762
Hey, man,
come back here, man

77
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,003
Man, no, man

78
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:35,579
Oh, man.

79
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,333
No, man, I got something
for him.

80
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,711
No, man, no, no

81
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm heading
for that punk

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,489
No, man,
I'm gonna fuck him up.

83
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,506
Man, I ain't playing.

84
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,803
I wonder,
my little darling,

85
00:07:52,424 --> 00:07:53,816
where can you be
again tonight

86
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:06,481
while the moon
is shining bright?

87
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:07,518
I wonder.

88
00:08:11,894 --> 00:08:13,508
My heart is...

89
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:26,495
just working myself
into my own hell.

90
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:32,130
I close my eyes,
can't get no sleep at night,

91
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,693
no peace of mind.

92
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,894
Why don't you
kill yourself?

93
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:39,592
You would be
a lot happier.

94
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:40,697
Go out like Johnny Ace.

95
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:46,845
No, I'm not gonna
kill myself.

96
00:08:56,052 --> 00:09:00,150
Got a feeling I might do
somebody else some harm, though.

97
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:07,610
When was the last time
you been in church?

98
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,916
Back home.

99
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,575
Since then, I've done
a lot of things.

100
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,840
Haven't done nothing yet
that would make the devil blush.

101
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,922
I don't have
any trouble sleeping.

102
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:22,020
I ain't ashamed of nothing
I can't help.

103
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,366
Hey, what's going on,
killer?

104
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:47,542
Where's my BB gun?

105
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,079
Mama threw it away.

106
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,616
Daddy

107
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:51,308
Daddy

108
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:56,539
Hey, boy, stop acting
like you ain't got no sense.

109
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:58,910
Daddy daddy

110
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,293
daddy daddy

111
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,222
Young man-

112
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,053
I got to go, man.

113
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,206
What's going on?

114
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:13,128
Oh, man, that cat's
something else.

115
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,049
Here come Bracy and Ernie Cox.

116
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,868
I don't want them asking me
for any money.

117
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm going out the front.

118
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:32,790
I see the wife got you
towing the cart.

119
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,871
I say, Oscar
must have been here.

120
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,920
How do you know that?

121
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,720
He's the only one
I know

122
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,642
that wears that
Old Spice aftershave.

123
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,690
Oh, say, man, if you want
to catch Oscar,

124
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,189
he just left.

125
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:48,159
So you want
some coffee, man?

126
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,543
Yeah, black.

127
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,220
Angie.

128
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,384
Angie.

129
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,968
Say, what does this
remind you of

130
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,650
when you hold it
next to your cheek?

131
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:26,916
Not a damn thing but hot air.

132
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:31,271
Didn't it remind you
of when you' re making love,

133
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,000
how warm her forehead gets
sometimes?

134
00:12:40,397 --> 00:12:42,127
Just like this?

135
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,019
So I don't go for women
who've got malaria.

136
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:10,017
So how y' all been doing, now?

137
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:12,002
Walking the streets
all night,

138
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,052
We passed here
about 3:00 last night,

139
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:14,980
and we saw the lights on,

140
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,798
but we decided
to keep on stepping.

141
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:18,855
Why didn't you stop?

142
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:19,656
I'm always awake.

143
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:20,617
Yeah,
counting sheep.

144
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:40,881
Man, I guess it's time for me
to get ready and go to work.

145
00:14:57,323 --> 00:15:03,151
Hey, man, maybe me and Ernest
can luck up on a slave

146
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,764
if we's lucky.

147
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,424
He played one,

148
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:53,274
he played knickknack
on my thumb

149
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,739
with a knickknack,
paddy-wack,

150
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:56,893
give a dog a bone,

151
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:00,190
this old man
came rolling home.

152
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,329
This is old man,
he played two,

153
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:06,243
he played knickknack
on my shoe.

154
00:17:06,243 --> 00:17:08,644
With a knickknack,
paddy-wack,

155
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:09,830
give a dog a bone,

156
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,271
this old man
came rolling home.

157
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:15,250
Now I'm craving your body.

158
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,788
Is this for real?

159
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,549
Temperatures rising.

160
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:19,926
I don't want to feel

161
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:24,793
I'm in the wrong place
to be real.

162
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:30,429
Whoa, and I'm longing
to love you just for a night,

163
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,079
kissing and hugging
and holding you tight.

164
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,259
Please let me love you
with all my might.

165
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,639
Reasons, the reasons
that we hear,

166
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,849
the reasons that we fear,

167
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:53,293
our feelings
won't disappear.

168
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,286
Oooh

169
00:18:54,286 --> 00:18:58,864
and after the love game
has been played,

170
00:18:58,864 --> 00:19:02,483
all our illusions
were just a parade,

171
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:09,176
and all our reasons
start to fade.

172
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:12,922
la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la.

173
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:15,501
la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la.

174
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,246
la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la.

175
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:25,010
you never smile anymore.

176
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,173
I used to think
you was just tired.

177
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,710
but I think
deep down inside,

178
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,817
you worried,
and you ain't happy.

179
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:35,786
Don't nothing ever
make you want to smile?

180
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,306
Why don't you try
to get some sleep?

181
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,651
I can do the dishes
tomorrow.

182
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:14,862
Hey, y' all,
stop whistling.

183
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:23,461
hey, y' all, look out

184
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:49,686
Hey, boy, you got to move
before you get hit.

185
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:50,742
What is America to me?

186
00:21:55,739 --> 00:22:01,982
A name, a map,
the flag I see,

187
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,231
a certain word, democracy?

188
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:13,478
What is America to me?

189
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:18,889
The house I live in,
a plot of earth, a street,

190
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:25,005
the grocer and the butcher
and the people that I meet,

191
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:28,303
the children
in the playground,

192
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,610
the faces that I see,

193
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,820
all races, all religions,
that's America to me.

194
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,236
Mother's there,
expecting me.

195
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:15,610
Father's waiting too.

196
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:21,213
Lots of folks
gathered there,

197
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:22,318
all the friends I knew.

198
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:34,840
All the friends I knew.

199
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,196
Hey, Stan.

200
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,637
Can you come out
and play, man?

201
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:56,934
That's my
hope-to-die buddy.

202
00:25:12,706 --> 00:25:14,723
Come on
out of there, man.

203
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:15,971
I know you here.

204
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:16,675
Hey, man.

205
00:25:16,675 --> 00:25:22,056
Let me have
a buck, man.

206
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:24,553
Hey, Stan,
open the door, babe.

207
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:26,795
Come on out of there.

208
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:29,613
say, look here, we need
to rap with you a minute, man.

209
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,534
go on,
Tell him the plan.

210
00:25:31,534 --> 00:25:33,583
Jive turkey.

211
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,769
See, look here, man.

212
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,530
You understand,
we need a third man,

213
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,298
you understand?

214
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:41,396
Somebody
recommended you.

215
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,734
Now, let me
tell you, man.

216
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:46,777
It's a one-to-five
proposition off-hand.

217
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:49,273
Me and him face a dark day
if we ever go before the man.

218
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:50,939
Hey, man, look,
I don't want to hear it.

219
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:52,573
No, I don't want
to hear it.

220
00:25:52,573 --> 00:25:53,213
wait a minute.

221
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,134
Let the man
tell you the deal.

222
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,799
Mm-hmm.

223
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,176
Well, look, man,
you know somebody

224
00:25:58,176 --> 00:25:59,648
that keep
their mouth shut?

225
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:00,834
Yes, you do, man.

226
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:02,563
And won't blush
to murder?

227
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:05,189
Man, you know more kind of
people like that than I do.

228
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,726
Who the hell told you
I'd help you

229
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:08,647
do away with somebody,
anyway?

230
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,896
A friend of yours.

231
00:26:09,896 --> 00:26:10,280
Who?

232
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,002
That don't make
no difference, man.

233
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:15,083
Say, look man,
we' re gonna do

234
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:15,757
the actual killing.

235
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,709
All we want you for
is the unnecessary details.

236
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,150
Just be in the background,
you know.

237
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,880
Don't want to hear it.

238
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,314
Why don't you let me
borrow your Roscoe?

239
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:24,466
Man, I don't keep
no gun.

240
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:39,836
Why you always want
to hurt somebody?

241
00:26:39,836 --> 00:26:41,567
Who, me?

242
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,903
That's the way
nature is.

243
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,146
I mean, an animal
has its teeth,

244
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,746
and a man has
his fists.

245
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:49,539
That's the way
I was brought up,

246
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:50,532
God damn me.

247
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:50,949
Right on.

248
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:52,710
I mean, when a man's
got scars on his mug

249
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,079
from dealing with
son of a bitches every day

250
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:57,545
for his natural life,

251
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:00,203
ain't nobody gonna
run over this nigger,

252
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:01,932
just drylongso.

253
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:06,222
Now, me and smoke here,
we taking our issue.

254
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:09,233
You be a man
if you can, Stan.

255
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,642
Wait-you wait just one minute.

256
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:11,731
You talking about
be a man; stand up.

257
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:14,740
Don't you know there's more
to it than just with your fists,

258
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,605
the scars on your mug?

259
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:16,373
You talking about an animal?

260
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:18,615
What, no, you think you' re still
in the bush some damn where?

261
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:20,953
You' re here, you use your brain;
that's what you use.

262
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:22,618
Both of you nothing-ass
niggers got a lot of nerve

263
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:25,180
coming over here, doing some shit like-
wait a minute.

264
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,429
What do you mean,
wait a minute?

265
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:27,518
I ain't gonna
wait a minute,

266
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:28,478
' cause if it was
wait a minute,

267
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:30,015
you wouldn't ever come
in the first place.

268
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,257
And you' re gonna sit here
and let them do this?

269
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,794
Wait a minute;
look at Stan.

270
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:35,747
Wwhat have he got?
he worked all his life.

271
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:36,324
What have he got?

272
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,533
He don't even have
a decent pair of pants.

273
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,550
All we trying to do
is help the nigger.

274
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,305
Hey, you can't live
if you afraid of dying.

275
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:44,682
Is that right?

276
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:45,513
Is that right?

277
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:47,467
Forget it, man.
Forget it.

278
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,505
Let's go.

279
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:04,534
Come back here, girl,
and put on your shoes.

280
00:28:04,534 --> 00:28:05,047
If you get sick,

281
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,897
I ain't got no money
to take you to the doctor.

282
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:11,100
Mot dear,
can I have a dollar?

283
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,900
say,
old longheaded boy,

284
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,829
how many times
did I tell you,

285
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,398
don't call your mother
'mot dear?'

286
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:16,174
You ain't in the country
or something.

287
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,872
Got to keep on rocking
to another day.

288
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:32,811
Keep bumpin', yeah.

289
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,540
I'm gonna shine my way.

290
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,781
Got to keep on rocking
to another day.

291
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,559
Keep bumpin', yeah.

292
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,225
I'm gonna shine my way.

293
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:46,099
Got to keep on rocking
to another day.

294
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,540
Can't get me,
Janice.

295
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,198
You can't run fast.

296
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:52,408
Get out of my way,
you skags.

297
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:53,240
Who you talking to?

298
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,331
I know you' re not
talking to me.

299
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:00,445
Kick his butt,
Suzie.

300
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:01,482
Ugly fag.

301
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,961
I'm gonna tell
your mother on you.

302
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:07,330
I'm gonna go get
my big brother.

303
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,131
Is he fine?

304
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,468
Come and get
your old raggedy bike.

305
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:10,884
You dog.

306
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,381
You got to come get
this raggedy thing.

307
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,823
You better
take it home.

308
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:16,040
Yeah, like I said, man,

309
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,577
You know, this apartment here
is beautiful.

310
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:20,299
But god damn, how you gonna live
in this apartment building

311
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,579
with all them fucking kids,

312
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,366
all them motherfucking people
bugging you?

313
00:29:24,366 --> 00:29:25,582
If you want to go out
in the backyard,

314
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:27,695
You got to share it
with four or five other tenants.

315
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:30,065
Girl, come on
in this house.

316
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:40,377
Haven't I told you about
listening to grown folks talk?

317
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:46,237
What do you want with another
raggedy ass car for, huh?

318
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,222
Just trying
to get ahead, man.

319
00:29:48,222 --> 00:29:49,438
You niggers are sick.

320
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:54,659
Now you think
you' re middle class.

321
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,451
Man, I ain't poor.

322
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:58,277
Look, I give away things
to the Salvation Army.

323
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:00,679
You can't give away nothing
to Salvation Army

324
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,407
If you' re poor.

325
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,681
We may not have
a damn thing sometimes.

326
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,474
You want to see somebody
that's poor?

327
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,557
Now, you go around
and look at Walter's.

328
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,911
Now, he be sitting over an oven
with nothing but a coat on

329
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,345
and sitting around there,
rubbing their knees all day

330
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:16,849
and eating nothing
but wild greens

331
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,451
picked out of a vacant lot.

332
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:23,574
Now, that ain't me,
and it damn sure won't be.

333
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,848
And tomorrow,
after I cash my check,

334
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:28,121
let's go over to Silbo's
and buy that motor

335
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:29,211
and put it in.

336
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:30,248
Right on.

337
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,363
How come you' re not
in the streets?

338
00:31:55,158 --> 00:31:56,374
I need some money.

339
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,078
What?

340
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,135
I need some money.

341
00:31:58,135 --> 00:32:00,793
Get yourself together
and get out of here,

342
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,644
because you know
you' re a no-good woman.

343
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:07,454
You get yourself in line.

344
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:12,706
It brings sorrow
to my heart.

345
00:32:12,706 --> 00:32:13,858
Tears fall from my eyes.

346
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:24,138
It brings sorrow
to my heart.

347
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:25,290
Tears fall from my eyes.

348
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:31,983
Well, my baby...

349
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,736
Shut off this damn car and go
buy us some Johnnie Walker,

350
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,586
and leave that damn
ripple shit at the counter.

351
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,149
Man, baby,
I'm feeling tired.

352
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,884
Get your ass up,

353
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:42,325
and don't roll
your eyes at me.

354
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,294
Hey, Mister, you want
to watch that car door?

355
00:32:55,294 --> 00:32:56,480
Oh, don't get mad.

356
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,632
I'm sorry.

357
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:18,414
May I help you?

358
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,512
Need a check cashed, please.

359
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:24,851
This is y' all's check?
Yes.

360
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:29,431
This is your check?
Yes.

361
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,122
Jerry?

362
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,494
Hell, no.

363
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,033
Hi, Stan.

364
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,754
What can I do
for you?

365
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:04,494
Uh, I want to know
if I can cash a check.

366
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:05,762
Hmm, maybe.

367
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,309
How come you don't come
and work for me?

368
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:16,951
I don't know.

369
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:19,481
Liquor stores get robbed
too much.

370
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,689
I'd just hate to get shot
in a holdup.

371
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:23,259
Oh, I'd protect you.

372
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,731
You could work
in the back with me.

373
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:29,919
He takes care
of the register.

374
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,609
You think about it.

375
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:34,178
It's a warm proposition.

376
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:34,870
Maybe.

377
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,071
What's the matter?

378
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:40,657
You better sit down.

379
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:47,509
Hey, why don't you
separate the money,

380
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:49,815
and, you know, you won't
have to pull it all out?

381
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:37,719
Who beat you up?

382
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,352
None of your damn business.

383
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:40,938
Adolf and Boulevard
jumped on him.

384
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:55,907
Hey, what's happening?

385
00:36:55,907 --> 00:37:00,646
What's happening,
old dude?

386
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,248
Hey, who's been working
on you?

387
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:05,931
Adolf and Boulevard
kicked his ass.

388
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,916
Who kicked him in the face?

389
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:08,607
Adolf.

390
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:11,374
What did he do that for?

391
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,847
He didn't have
nothing else to do

392
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,608
with his hands
and his feet, nigger.

393
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:17,009
Yeah, he kicked your ass
for being so smart, huh?

394
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:18,771
What till I get on my feet.

395
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,340
I'm just
going outside.

396
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,608
Okay, baby.

397
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:48,745
Boo.

398
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:55,436
How come you' re
not going to school?

399
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:57,165
I've been sick.

400
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,004
You' re gonna fall behind.

401
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:08,149
Can you play cards?

402
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:09,302
Solitaire.

403
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:17,179
Suit yourself.

404
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:19,708
All I got is $10.

405
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:20,977
I told you.

406
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:32,871
what is this,
A damn regular sideshow?

407
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,446
How is my sister married to such
A silly ass, foul-mouthed dick?

408
00:39:45,321 --> 00:39:49,482
How come me and you
ain't never got together?

409
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,347
What would you do?

410
00:39:56,176 --> 00:40:00,978
I wouldn't know what position
to take, mama.

411
00:40:00,978 --> 00:40:02,740
You dirty dog.

412
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,468
You ought to find yourself
a place to stay

413
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,870
instead of sponging
off my sister.

414
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,983
This is my uncle's house too.

415
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:09,688
Please...

416
00:40:09,688 --> 00:40:14,331
Well, tell this nigger
to shut up then.

417
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,957
Don't you have
any money?

418
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,167
I ain't got nothing but $5.

419
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:19,935
$5.

420
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:21,600
That's all.

421
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,522
Tell him we'll give him $15.

422
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,284
All we got is $15.

423
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:28,293
Don't sell them
nothing, uncle, hear?

424
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:28,805
Nothing.

425
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:30,294
Hey, man, why don't you
be cool?

426
00:40:37,389 --> 00:40:39,244
You know, you would be
a good-looking fella

427
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:42,159
if you didn't frown so much.

428
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:42,671
Who, me?

429
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:45,521
Some sisters told me I look
just like Clark Gable.

430
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:48,147
You about as tasteless
as a carrot.

431
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:51,445
You always in an old nasty
frame of mind.

432
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:53,398
Tou' re just a regular
hardship case.

433
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:56,697
Someone always trying
to revive your poor ass

434
00:40:56,697 --> 00:40:57,818
or give you first aid.

435
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:02,077
Always feeling sorry
for yourself.

436
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:04,638
If I don't,
nobody else will,

437
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:11,139
and you're just
an all-day sucker, bitch.

438
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:14,373
Sil, she kicked your nephew
over here, man.

439
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:17,479
Sil, man, come over here, man,
to sit by him.

440
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:20,265
I've got more important
things to do.

441
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,186
My hair is falling out.

442
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:23,307
Sil, man, he's bleeding.

443
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:25,389
Why'd you have to kick
the son of a bitch

444
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,253
in his damn head?

445
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:28,814
Sil, you'd better come over here
and see about your nephew.

446
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:30,992
Can't you see
I don't give a damn?

447
00:41:30,992 --> 00:41:33,745
He shouldn't have run
his damn mouth so much.

448
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:39,127
Give me $15 for the motor
and a shirt for collateral,

449
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:39,895
and it be slick.

450
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:39,615
You got that?

451
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:41,056
We' re gonna do this.

452
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:42,017
Go all the way down.

453
00:43:16,378 --> 00:43:17,722
You all right?

454
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:18,875
We got one more step down.

455
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:19,911
One more?

456
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:56,571
Got it?

457
00:43:58,486 --> 00:44:00,023
Argh, raise it;
get it up.

458
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:00,791
It's on my finger.

459
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,168
All right, you got it?
Yeah.

460
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:03,418
You got it now?
Yeah.

461
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:06,555
I thought you went home.

462
00:44:06,555 --> 00:44:07,612
You all right?

463
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,405
Just leave it there.
It'll stay there.

464
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:10,110
No, it won't, man.

465
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:12,063
Let's push it
back up in there.

466
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,024
It'll stay up there.

467
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,734
You all right?
Huh?

468
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:23,270
Just smashed them
a little bit.

469
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,281
I think it'll
be all right.

470
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,906
Should we put this
all the way back up there?

471
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:29,899
It'll stay there.

472
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:31,308
Just leave it there.

473
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:32,237
Let's get going.

474
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:33,198
It'll stay on there.

475
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:04,067
Block is busted.

476
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,852
How it ain't no good.

477
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:07,909
May as well forget it.

478
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,897
It ain't no good.

479
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:14,730
It's busted.

480
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:15,978
Nothing we can do with it.

481
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:23,953
All that work for nothing.

482
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:50,883
Just leave it to me.

483
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,145
Don't ever be ashamed.

484
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:05,933
Just give me a chance.

485
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:12,819
I'll take care
of everything.

486
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:19,463
Your troubles I'll share.

487
00:46:24,635 --> 00:46:31,615
Let me know,
and I'll be there.

488
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:32,623
I'll take care of you

489
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:39,109
Anyplace and anywhere.

490
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:46,538
shake a hand,

491
00:46:46,538 --> 00:46:48,036
shake a hand.

492
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,878
Shake a hand,

493
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:54,376
Shake a hand.

494
00:46:57,618 --> 00:46:58,961
Shake a hand,

495
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:00,460
shake a hand.

496
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:05,333
Shake a hand

497
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,601
if you can.

498
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:10,458
Be truthful to me.

499
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,055
I'll be truthful to you.

500
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:23,171
I'm in love with you so,

501
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:34,601
and I don't know what to do.

502
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,706
So let's call it a day.

503
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:42,016
I said all I have to say,

504
00:47:46,995 --> 00:47:53,143
except don't forget to pray

505
00:47:53,143 --> 00:47:54,439
and shake a hand every day.

506
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,533
Throw my goddamn shades down.

507
00:48:53,024 --> 00:48:54,274
Throw my goddamned shades.

508
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,325
You can forget about living
when I catch you.

509
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,400
The only thing
that looks good dying

510
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,553
is a rose.

511
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,159
Hey, Truman Doyle.

512
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:30,362
Truman Doyle, wait a minute.

513
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:31,386
Hey, Truman Doyle.

514
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:32,057
Is that you, man?

515
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:33,563
Who the shit
does it look like, man?

516
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,325
It looks like somebody
that owes me some money.

517
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:37,342
Look, man, I ain't got
nothing but my good looks.

518
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,999
But look, do you know where
we can get us a few bucks at?

519
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,305
Yeah, go rob
a damn liquor store.

520
00:49:42,305 --> 00:49:45,155
Look, you look better going
than you did coming, anyway.

521
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:47,077
So get on, nigger.

522
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:48,691
Come on, Gene.

523
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:08,051
Why don't you go in the house
and put some shoes on?

524
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:09,434
Shit on you.

525
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:27,361
This bitter earth,

526
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:35,911
well, what fruit it bears.

527
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:44,492
what good is love,

528
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:51,986
mmm, that no one shares?

529
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,769
And if my life
is like the dust,

530
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:16,418
ooh, that hides
the glow of a rose,

531
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:18,147
what good am I?

532
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:23,655
Heaven only knows.

533
00:51:34,511 --> 00:51:35,665
Lord, this bitter earth,

534
00:51:42,581 --> 00:51:43,541
Yes, can be so cold.

535
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,028
Today you' re young.

536
00:51:58,592 --> 00:51:59,601
Too soon you' re old.

537
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:05,461
But while a voice
within me cries,

538
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:20,046
I'm sure someone
may answer my call,

539
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:22,736
and this bitter earth,

540
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:24,272
oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh,

541
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:25,953
may not, oh,
be so bitter after all.

542
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:16,181
Memories that just
don't seem mine,

543
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:18,902
like half-eaten cake,

544
00:53:18,902 --> 00:53:23,833
rabbit skin stretched
on the backyard fences,

545
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,113
my grandma.

546
00:53:25,113 --> 00:53:31,647
Mot dear, mot dear, mot dear
dragging her shadow

547
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:34,049
across the porch,

548
00:53:34,049 --> 00:53:37,026
standing bare-headed
under the sun,

549
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:38,707
cleaning red catfish
with white rum.

550
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:25,451
Come get me.

551
00:54:54,681 --> 00:54:56,294
Don't do that.

552
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:00,989
Where the dog at?

553
00:55:00,989 --> 00:55:05,886
That mother
sucker fucker.

554
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,385
Come on, dog.

555
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,772
Keep running.

556
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,681
This is a mean old world

557
00:55:55,681 --> 00:55:56,978
try to live in by yourself.

558
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:08,074
This is a mean old world

559
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:09,371
try to live in by yourself.

560
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:17,745
Can't get the one you love

561
00:56:17,745 --> 00:56:19,138
and have to use
somebody else.

562
00:56:30,106 --> 00:56:32,987
I've got the blues.

563
00:56:32,987 --> 00:56:34,332
Gonna pack my things and go.

564
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:45,540
Yes, I've got the blues.

565
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,885
Gonna pack my things and go.

566
00:56:53,002 --> 00:56:54,586
well, I guess
you don't love me...

567
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:23,438
450, 451, 452, 453,

568
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:29,090
453, 454, 455, 456, 451,

569
00:57:35,942 --> 00:57:39,529
452, 453, 454,

570
00:57:39,529 --> 00:57:40,682
455, 456, 450, 452, 450-

571
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,415
Can't you count?

572
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:49,424
Count yourself, then.

573
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:55,524
Look at them old ugly girls.

574
00:57:55,524 --> 00:57:56,643
Your daddy.

575
00:57:56,643 --> 00:58:01,000
You want to come on,
want to fight, then?

576
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,465
Okay, I'll see you later.

577
00:58:03,465 --> 00:58:04,473
All right, take care.

578
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:16,575
Hey, man.

579
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:09,176
So what did
you do today?

580
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:19,502
Got to find me a job.

581
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:26,723
Tomorrow's Saturday.

582
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:39,949
Let's go to bed.

583
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:39,367
Catch a rat, cat

584
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,016
Gene,

585
01:03:18,016 --> 01:03:18,850
we needed food
in the house.

586
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,675
You shouldn't have spent
your last dime

587
01:03:20,675 --> 01:03:22,116
to get
this car fixed.

588
01:03:22,116 --> 01:03:25,958
That ain't right.

589
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:26,951
Don'

590
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:29,161
If things come to worse,
we can always sell it.

591
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:51,223
What are we gonna do
about it now?

592
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:52,088
How's it going, Dian?

593
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:53,785
Ain't nothing to it,
you know?

594
01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:54,586
Gene.

595
01:03:54,586 --> 01:03:55,131
What it is?

596
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,219
Not too much.
What are you doing?

597
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:58,908
Oh, just trying to get
this old car together.

598
01:03:58,908 --> 01:04:02,112
Yeah. Look, let me
give you a hand.

599
01:04:02,112 --> 01:04:03,073
Oh, here, take this.

600
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,661
Miss Sally gave me $5
for cleaning behind the garage,

601
01:04:10,661 --> 01:04:12,742
and she gave me
some peaches too.

602
01:04:12,742 --> 01:04:16,777
Thanks.
I'll pay you back.

603
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:19,178
Go on,
you can have half.

604
01:04:19,178 --> 01:04:20,792
No, thank you.

605
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,473
It's getting late.

606
01:04:27,473 --> 01:04:29,553
Let's go in
and have some coffee

607
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:35,286
and see what my guests
are doing.

608
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:36,246
Slam

609
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:57,029
I'm gonna get up
in the morning.

610
01:04:57,029 --> 01:05:03,594
I believe I should go
back home.

611
01:05:03,594 --> 01:05:05,899
I'm gonna get up
in the morning.

612
01:05:05,899 --> 01:05:12,143
I believe I should go
back home.

613
01:05:12,143 --> 01:05:15,345
I'm gonna find my baby,

614
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:16,930
acknowledge
that I done her wrong.

615
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:25,369
Are you happy now?

616
01:05:29,948 --> 01:05:30,555
Got a point.

617
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,349
You've got a point
right here.

618
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,398
Nine, nine more points.

619
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:35,423
What's wrong with you?

620
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:36,544
You' re going crazy.

621
01:05:36,544 --> 01:05:38,434
Shoot the dice.

622
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,443
Well, you know
she's a mean, wild woman

623
01:05:41,443 --> 01:05:49,001
' bout to drive me
out of my mind.

624
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:51,371
Hey, brother, why don't
you two fellas come on,

625
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:52,379
get in the game, man?

626
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:03,796
Back 'em up nine, yeah.

627
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,042
Nine.

628
01:06:15,836 --> 01:06:18,332
Going over
the street sign.

629
01:06:18,332 --> 01:06:21,278
And I said
all I could think of

630
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:23,424
Was the blood
getting to my head.

631
01:06:23,424 --> 01:06:24,545
Huh? Huh?

632
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:26,690
And Alma Jean,
all I could see,

633
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,836
her was wearing
that cascade on her head

634
01:06:28,836 --> 01:06:30,085
that looks
like a birdcage.

635
01:06:35,914 --> 01:06:39,083
so her Boulevard,
as she calls him,

636
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:39,852
fire to her jibs

637
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:48,177
bring the rest
of the stuff.

638
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:49,490
Boulevard-

639
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:52,213
Man, what is your problem?

640
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:53,557
I don't have time.

641
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,479
We gonna get us
something to eat.

642
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:56,471
I don't have time.

643
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:59,064
Boulevard kept circling
the five-four ballroom,

644
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:01,883
Thinking we can get some music
and some food together.

645
01:07:01,883 --> 01:07:02,266
Stop.

646
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:08,768
I said-I said, Alma Jean,
tell this nigger of yours

647
01:07:08,768 --> 01:07:12,065
that don't he know
we can get 15 years

648
01:07:12,065 --> 01:07:13,667
for him acting
felonious?

649
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,685
Get out of the way.

650
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:16,357
You ready?

651
01:07:16,357 --> 01:07:17,670
Come on,
get in the car.

652
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:20,135
I said, Alma Jean,

653
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:22,985
don't you know that nigger
of yours can get 15 years

654
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:23,690
for being felonious?

655
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,194
Don't you know
people are changed?

656
01:07:25,194 --> 01:07:26,443
Man, we' re ready to go.

657
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,429
We don't act like this
no more.

658
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:31,183
Get in the car.

659
01:07:31,183 --> 01:07:32,815
Gene's gonna drive me
till I swear.

660
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,690
Don't go so damn fast.

661
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,092
We might miss
where we' re going:

662
01:08:01,092 --> 01:08:05,415
the country, please.

663
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,471
If I had a few bucks,

664
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:08,329
I'd bet it on that old
son of a bitch

665
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:12,620
in the ninth race
at Los Alomitos.

666
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:15,533
How much you paying,
child?

667
01:08:15,533 --> 01:08:17,517
Ten-to-one odds.

668
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:18,319
That ain't enough.

669
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,080
Catch one of them
long shots.

670
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,643
Hell, this is
a long shot, shit.

671
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:23,507
Ten to one?

672
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:24,691
Yeah, ten to one.

673
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:25,604
That's a long shot.

674
01:09:29,857 --> 01:09:30,817
Shit.

675
01:09:30,817 --> 01:09:33,026
Look, man, I told you
to have a spare tire

676
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:35,940
and don't be coming out here
in the middle of nowhere.

677
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:39,975
I got to get to this race
out at Los Alomitos, man.

678
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:40,808
Lookit here in the ninth race.

679
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:45,259
I got me a nag, man,
that I know is gonna come in.

680
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:48,621
I got me some money, man,
and you ain't got no spare.

681
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:53,071
Look, look, look.
aw, shit.

682
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:54,962
Man, I'm out here
singing the blues.

683
01:09:54,962 --> 01:09:57,299
Got my money on a horse
that can't lose.

684
01:09:57,299 --> 01:09:58,867
You out here on a flat.

685
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:01,045
I always told you
to keep a spare,

686
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:02,167
but you's a square.

687
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:05,400
That's why you can't
keep no spare.

688
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,002
Now how we gonna
get there, huh?

689
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:10,683
We'll just have to ride back
on the rim, that's all.

690
01:10:10,683 --> 01:10:11,692
I ain't got no spare.

691
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:23,654
We'll ride back
on the rim.

692
01:10:57,374 --> 01:10:58,941
Stan Jr. done left
this house open.

693
01:10:58,941 --> 01:11:00,046
I'm gonna
kill that boy.

694
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:08,772
It's gonna rain.

695
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:10,261
And the roof
still needs fixing.

696
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:28,658
Daddy, what makes the rain?

697
01:11:28,658 --> 01:11:30,386
Why, it's the devil
beating his wife.

698
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:50,434
Is that all I get?

699
01:11:56,357 --> 01:11:57,318
Hmm.

700
01:12:19,222 --> 01:12:20,260
Stan Jr.?

701
01:12:23,128 --> 01:12:24,050
Stan Jr.

702
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:31,453
You know you hear me
calling you, boy

703
01:12:31,453 --> 01:12:33,182
I know that boy heard me
calling him.

704
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:20,203
Oh, girl.

705
01:13:22,849 --> 01:13:23,777
Well, well.

706
01:13:23,777 --> 01:13:26,275
Look who's visiting.

707
01:13:26,275 --> 01:13:27,651
Honey, tell me why
you' re wearing

708
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:28,932
that pretty smile
on your face.

709
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:31,847
Well, she's gonna
have a baby.

710
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:34,504
I thought her old man
was shooting blanks,

711
01:13:34,504 --> 01:13:36,905
but I see he's dropping bombs
on occasion, I guess.

712
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:58,009
This bitter earth,

713
01:14:05,182 --> 01:14:06,431
Well, what fruit it bears.

714
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:15,365
What good is love,

715
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:22,698
Mmm, that no one shares?

716
01:14:31,152 --> 01:14:32,641
And if my life
is like the dust,

717
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,566
Ooh, that hides
the glow of a rose,

718
01:14:47,227 --> 01:14:48,956
What good am i?

719
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:54,368
Heaven only knows.

720
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:06,473
Lord, this bitter earth...

721
01:15:13,549 --> 01:15:14,510
Yes, can be so cold.

722
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:22,739
Today you' re young.

723
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:30,184
Too soon you' re old.

724
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:35,980
But while a voice
within me cries,

725
01:15:44,482 --> 01:15:50,662
I'm sure someone
may answer my call,

726
01:15:50,662 --> 01:15:53,223
and this bitter earth,

727
01:15:53,223 --> 01:15:55,721
oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh,

728
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:59,275
may not, oh,

729
01:15:59,275 --> 01:16:00,380
be so bitter after all.

730
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:13,366
I'm just going home.

731
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:31,843
I'm just going home.

732
01:16:49,999 --> 01:16:50,543
Going home.
