1
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,660
Mother, stop!

2
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,620
You've been talking for three days.

3
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,020
I've thought it over.

4
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,660
Alright, I'll get married.

5
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,100
Good! To what sort of man?

6
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,860
What sort of man? Is it up to me?

7
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,140
You always speak of money.
Why not marry a rich man?

8
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,420
Marry a rich man and you'll
only be his concubine.

9
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,780
Let me be a concubine.

10
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,420
Isn't that a woman's fate?

11
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,300
Miss, looking for someone?

12
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm Songlian.

13
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,500
We met once, remember?

14
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,900
It's our Fourth Mistress! Please wait..

15
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,740
We sent the bridal sedan for you.
Didn't it arrive?

16
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,780
I walked here myself.

17
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
- Let me carry it.
- I can manage.

18
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,540
Wait here. I'll go take a look.

19
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,780
Who are you?

20
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,580
Fourth Mistress, please come in.

21
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,100
So the Fourth Mistress is you!

22
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,580
Yes, I'm the Fourth Mistress!

23
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,860
Bring my suitcase inside.

24
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,220
This is where you will live.

25
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,100
My name is Chen Baishun, the housekeeper.
I am at your service.

26
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Why are there so many red lanterns?

27
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,900
Because you're coming!

28
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,660
Fourth Mistress,
this is part of our family custom.

29
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm here to serve you.

30
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,380
You'll get used to it.

31
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,060
Fourth Mistress. We're here to do your
hair and help you change.

32
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,700
Master, congratulations on your wedding.

33
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,620
How was the foot massage?

34
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,140
A woman's feet are very important.

35
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,740
When they're comfortable,
she is healthier..

36
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,700
and better able to serve her man.

37
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,060
Pick up that lantern.

38
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,020
Yes, that one.

39
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,780
Higher..

40
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,100
Look up.

41
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,060
Educated girls are different.

42
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,180
Now, undress and get in bed.

43
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,100
Put out the lights.

44
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,540
What? I have all these lanterns
so I can see.

45
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,220
I like it bright and formal.

46
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,140
Who's there?

47
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,460
Third Mistress is sick.
She wants you to come.

48
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,020
I'm in bed.

49
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,940
It's an emergency.

50
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,340
She said you must come.

51
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,940
It can wait till tomorrow.

52
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,300
If something serious happens to her,

53
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,740
we'll be blamed.

54
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,540
Damn it! What is she up to?

55
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,260
I'll have to go see.
Or she won't let me sleep tonight.

56
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,100
The Master is leaving?
Going to the third house?

57
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,020
Yes!

58
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,220
Light the lanterns at the third house!

59
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,980
Fourth Mistress..

60
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,300
Fourth Mistress..

61
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,580
Fourth Mistress. According to our custom,

62
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,940
you should visit the other three mistress.

63
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,580
Take your breakfast later.

64
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,100
It's our custom to have all
meetings and meals here.

65
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,900
The Chen family's customs
go back many generations.

66
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,660
It is important that you obey them.

67
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,580
Kowtow to our ancestors.

68
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,020
First, go to greet the master at
the Third Mistress' house.

69
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,620
It seems they're still asleep.

70
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,460
We'll come back.

71
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,140
First Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress is here to visit.

72
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,820
Big sister.

73
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,020
How old are you?

74
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,940
Nineteen.

75
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
I heard you went to university.

76
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,500
For six months.

77
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,900
It's good you're educated.

78
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,980
You'll get used to living here.

79
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,100
Get on well with your sisters.

80
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,540
Serve the Master well.

81
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
You can go now.

82
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,900
Such sins, such sins..

83
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,180
What is she, about 100 years old? Ancient!

84
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,740
Second Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress has come to visit.

85
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,140
Fourth sister is here. Come in!

86
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,020
Second sister.

87
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,140
Do come in.

88
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,220
What a pretty face! What is your name?

89
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,540
Songlian.

90
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,540
A pretty name, too.

91
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm Zhouyun. Just call me by my name.

92
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,260
You look like a student.

93
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,100
I was at university for six months.

94
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,900
Why did you leave?

95
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,300
My father died.
The family couldn't afford it.

96
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,180
How old was your father?

97
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,740
Fifty-three.

98
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,980
So young!

99
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,940
Life is so unpredictable.

100
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,220
Tea, Fourth Mistress.

101
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,540
Fourth sister, please have some tea.

102
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Where are you from?

103
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,740
Fengcheng.

104
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,580
They grow tea there.

105
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,460
My father was in the tea business.

106
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,540
His shop closed down.

107
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,340
Your mother let you marry someone
from so far away?

108
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,860
She's my stepmother.

109
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,980
I see.

110
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,860
So, how was the foot massage last night?

111
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,380
Is it like that every night?

112
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,460
Silly.

113
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,500
You can't have it whenever you wish.

114
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,500
Where the master spends the night..

115
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,660
that mistress gets a foot massage
and lighted lanterns.

116
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,100
With a new wife as young
and pretty as you..

117
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,540
I'm afraid I won't be enjoying
these privileges for some time.

118
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,660
But don't underestimate the
importance of this custom.

119
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,580
If you can manage to have a
foot massage everyday..

120
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,940
you'll soon be running this household.

121
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,140
Yizhen, come meet your Fourth Aunt.

122
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,700
Fourth Aunt!

123
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,060
How useless! I only have a daughter.

124
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,460
It's getting late.

125
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,620
We must visit the Third Mistress.

126
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,020
Sorry, I just keep talking.

127
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,260
Of course you must meet
the Third Mistress.

128
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,580
She was a famous opera singer.

129
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,140
She sings well and is pretty too.

130
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,220
But she can be so difficult.

131
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Asking for the Master on..

132
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,140
your wedding night!

133
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,140
So impolite to you!

134
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,020
Wasn't she sick?

135
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,260
Sick? She's just spoiled!

136
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,180
Has the Master left?

137
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,140
Just now.
They're putting out the lanterns.

138
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,220
Let's meet the Third Mistress.

139
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,140
Third Mistress says
she isn't feeling well..

140
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,860
and says she'll meet you another day.

141
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,660
Third Mistress' son, Feilan.

142
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,220
Same age as Miss Yizhen.

143
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,780
Come meet your Fourth Aunt.

144
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,020
Fourth Aunt!

145
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
Fourth Mistress..

146
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,180
Fourth Mistress..

147
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,540
this is Yan'er.

148
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,740
Master says she'll be your maid.

149
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,420
Yan'er, come greet the Fourth Mistress.

150
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,700
Fourth Mistress.

151
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I've seen her before.
Bad tempered, isn't she?

152
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,380
No, she's a good girl.
Quick and hardworking too.

153
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,540
Been here for several years.

154
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,660
No lice in her hair, are there?
I hate lice.

155
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,060
Let the Fourth mistress take a look.

156
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,740
Kneel down. Let's look at your hair.

157
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,260
What is that smell? Go wash your hair!

158
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,220
Didn't you hear?

159
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,900
I only washed it yesterday.

160
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,140
And wash the clothes I just took
off while you're at it.

161
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,860
Go, quickly!

162
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,700
Or the Fourth Mistress will be angry. Go!

163
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,620
Yan'er!

164
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Yan'er!

165
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,540
Why haven't you washed your hair?

166
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,660
The Master favours you and you
thought he'd choose you as a wife.

167
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,300
You as our Fourth Mistress?

168
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,300
You were born to be a servant.

169
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,660
Serve the Fourth Mistress well!

170
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
Don't waste your time dreaming!

171
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,140
And don't forget to wash your hair!

172
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,260
Where is Meishan?

173
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,740
The Third Mistress is coming.

174
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,660
Doctor Gao is writing her a prescription.

175
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,940
Here comes third sister.

176
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,300
Third sister, this is our fourth sister.

177
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,660
You haven't met, have you?

178
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,460
Third sister!

179
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,980
Songlian is new here.
Take good care of her.

180
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,020
From now on, you sisters must
get on well with each other.

181
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,500
Let's eat.

182
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,660
Why aren't you eating?

183
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,780
I don't like meat.

184
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
What vegetable dishes do we have today?

185
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,260
Master, today we have..

186
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,580
fragrant mushrooms, chrysanthemum
moss hair, bird's nest..

187
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,100
thrice-fried mushroom,
five-color vegetables..

188
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,860
vegetarian hot-pot and
also heart of cactus.

189
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,660
According to custom..

190
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
the one with lighted lanterns
can have whatever she likes.

191
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,620
What would you like?

192
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,980
I want spinach and beancurd.

193
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,420
Bring some spinach and beancurd.

194
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Also some young bean sprouts.

195
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,380
Fourth Mistress..

196
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,260
Master asks you to wait at
the door for instructions.

197
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,620
What instructions?

198
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,060
Please wait outside.

199
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,620
The Master may have instructions
before he retires.

200
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,620
But why do we have to wait outside?

201
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,180
It's another old family custom.

202
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,660
All the other mistresses ago.

203
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,780
But I wasn't called before.

204
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,220
Not for nine days after the wedding.

205
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,060
This is your 10th day.

206
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,020
Light the lanterns at the fourth house!

207
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,460
Well?

208
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,260
Lighted lanterns, foot massages.
Do you like it here?

209
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,740
After a few days, you won't want to leave.

210
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,540
Who is it?

211
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,380
Third Mistress says she's sick again.

212
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,220
She wants the master to come over.

213
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,580
Third sister is asking for you again.
You must go.

214
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,860
Meishan is so impossible!

215
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,900
Go, don't come to me again.

216
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,340
You don't mean that.

217
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,580
Tell the Third Mistress
I won't see her tonight!

218
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,180
What am I to tell her?

219
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,140
Nonsense! What do you mean?

220
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,260
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow!

221
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,220
- Who's singing? Third sister?
- Yes.

222
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,780
She was sick last night..

223
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,500
but she's singing at this hour.

224
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,140
She won't let us sleep.

225
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,900
She sings when she's happy,
cries when she's mad.

226
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,580
That bitch! Never mind her!

227
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:35,460
Third sister, have you recovered?

228
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,740
Did I wake you from your sweet dreams?

229
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,780
Yes, you did.

230
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,020
Good, or you'll sleep till you're silly.

231
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,820
Silly, hardly!
I came up to hear third sister sing.

232
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,060
Do continue.

233
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,260
You want to listen..

234
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,540
but I don't feel like singing anymore.

235
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,860
You went to hear Meishan sing?

236
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,660
I've spoiled her.

237
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,820
When she's angry,
she even curses my ancestors.

238
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,580
Bitch!

239
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,820
I must teach her a lesson.

240
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,660
What? Angry?

241
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,980
Don't be childish.

242
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,060
I'll take you to Wumei Lane
today to eat dumplings.

243
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,900
Didn't you say you liked
the dumplings there?

244
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,060
You really don't want me to stay?

245
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,300
There are others desperate for
a foot massage, you know.

246
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,260
The Master has left!
Blow out the lanterns!

247
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,620
Light the lanterns at the third house!

248
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,860
Yan'er!

249
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,260
Yan'er! Yan'er!

250
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,780
Coming!

251
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,820
Can't you walk faster?

252
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,900
Go away if you don't like working for me.

253
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,780
Don't think because the mater touched you,
you can behave this way.

254
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Always pulling a long face!

255
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,700
No, I wouldn't dare.

256
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,180
But any face is better than having none!

257
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,100
Why did you come to me?

258
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,180
Tired of your new wife already?

259
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,940
What's so good about my place?

260
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,180
She's mad at me.

261
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,940
Of course it's good here.

262
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,540
You are gentle and you'll sing for me.

263
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,060
Well done!

264
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,860
Well done!

265
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,540
The more you sing,
the better it gets. Again!

266
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,700
Fourth sister!

267
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,340
Fourth sister, come down here!

268
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,740
I've something to say to you.

269
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,860
Fourth sister.

270
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,140
Why wandering alone?

271
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,220
Come down.

272
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,780
I'm looking for you.

273
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,020
Second sister.

274
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,300
You don't look well.

275
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,700
No more lighted lanterns
and foot massages..

276
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,260
are you unhappy?

277
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,420
I don't care. I like being alone.

278
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,460
You don't want to be alone in this family.

279
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,580
No foot massages for a few days..

280
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,900
and the servants don't
treat you the same way.

281
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,780
The master can come and go as he pleases.

282
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,260
Doesn't he find these custom troublesome?

283
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,540
Lighting lanterns is an old family custom.

284
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,620
It was like this when I arrived.

285
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,740
This is silk from Suzhou.
Have some dresses made with it.

286
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,140
I'm embarrassed.

287
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,580
I should be giving you gifts.

288
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,180
Why?

289
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,180
I thought of this silk
when I first saw you.

290
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,460
I wouldn't give it to that singer..

291
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,220
even if she paid for it.

292
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,220
Did you see how self-satisfied
she was just now?

293
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,340
What is that small room for up above?

294
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,940
It's locked with a big chain.

295
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,940
That house of death?

296
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,740
Don't go there.
Several people have died there.

297
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,940
What people?

298
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,580
Women from past generations.
They hanged there.

299
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,980
Don't ask about this.
Nobody here wants to talk about it.

300
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:44,020
Visit me when you have time.
Don't go there again.

301
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,900
The Master's out.

302
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,100
He said you shouldn't wait for him.

303
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,540
Let's eat then.

304
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,780
Why is there no spinach and beancurd?

305
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,260
There are too many vegetable
dishes already.

306
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Go, bring some pork steamed
in lotus leaves.

307
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,540
Yes.

308
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,780
Why so many meat dishes today?

309
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,620
The third house had lighted
lanterns yesterday.

310
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,380
Didn't the master remarry recently?

311
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,540
Who knows about these things?

312
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,580
It's up to him.

313
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,220
The house with lighted lanterns
sets the menu.

314
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,500
We just follow orders.

315
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,140
Who is it?

316
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,020
Yan'er.

317
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,860
Why are you sneaking around like that?

318
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Third Mistress asks you
over to play majong.

319
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:22,060
Me, play majong? What an idea!

320
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,060
I won't go.

321
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,300
Fourth sister..

322
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,260
Fourth sister..

323
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,660
we need one more player. Come!

324
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,220
I don't like majong.

325
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,180
Come on. Don't stay in your house all day.

326
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,140
Still angry about the spinach
and beancurd?

327
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,100
I couldn't care less.

328
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,940
Good. I knew fourth sister wasn't petty.

329
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,180
Don't like losing your money to me too?

330
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,220
Don't worry. I'll let you win.

331
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,900
Since you put it that way, then I must go.

332
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,780
But no need to let me win.

333
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,780
Who knows how the game will end?

334
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,020
Good!

335
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,140
This is Doctor Gao, a regular visitor.

336
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,940
He is our family doctor.

337
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,540
His friend, Mr. Wang.

338
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,980
This is our Fourth Mistress.

339
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,940
Please sit down.

340
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,340
Let's start.

341
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Our Fourth Mistress was a
university student.

342
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,660
I'm only an opera singer.

343
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,620
She plays to win today.

344
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,900
Both of you should be careful.

345
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,420
Come, it's just a game.

346
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,540
Third sister's house is
decorated like a stage.

347
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,660
No one can forget their past.

348
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,420
The Master's back.

349
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,380
Why wasn't it announced?

350
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,940
I just came in.

351
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,900
The Master must be tired.

352
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,300
Where is she?

353
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,060
Playing majong with the Third Mistress.

354
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,900
I'll call her.

355
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,900
Never mind.

356
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,420
Why can't she stay in her own house?

357
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,380
Light the lanterns at the second house.

358
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,860
The master's back. He couldn't find you..

359
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,900
and went to the second house.

360
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,540
Nevermind. Let's play.

361
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,540
Fourth sister has done Zhuoyun a favour.

362
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,020
She is so lonely.

363
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,740
Lend her the master for one night.

364
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,460
If you lose money, have her pay you back.

365
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,620
Then you're even.

366
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:45,340
I heard the Fourth Mistress
didn't finish university. Why?

367
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,500
What's the use?

368
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,140
I'm just one of the Master's robes.

369
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,660
He can wear it or he can take it off.

370
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,660
Master, I want to give you a son.

371
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:58,260
Meishan was famous for singing this opera.

372
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,580
That was years ago.

373
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,060
This place must be haunted.

374
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,900
Haunted? Nonsense!

375
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,820
That room on the roof.

376
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,860
Two people hanged there, that's all.

377
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,860
Why?

378
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:29,180
Need you ask?
They were having illicit affairs.

379
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,380
Who were they?

380
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:37,580
Nobody you know.
Two women from past generations.

381
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,660
Concubines?

382
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,500
Don't talk nonsense!

383
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,460
What is it now?

384
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:04,940
She's peeping at us.

385
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,100
- Who?
- Yan'er.

386
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:12,540
What's there to look at.
She can't see anything anyway.

387
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,300
You're always on her side.

388
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,780
I can smell her miles away.

389
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,380
- Who is it?
- Master.

390
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,580
What is it?

391
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,300
The Fourth Mistress'
spinach and beancurd is ready.

392
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,180
The other mistresses are waiting.

393
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,660
I'm not going. Ask them to bring it here.

394
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,460
That's not right.

395
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,020
We should go or they'll talk.

396
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,300
Them!

397
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,140
What do I care if they talk!

398
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,660
Alright, we'll eat here.

399
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,180
Go, tell them to bring the food here.

400
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,060
The Master asks that you go ahead.

401
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,740
He isn't coming.

402
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,860
The food will be taken to
the Fourth Mistress' room.

403
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,340
We don't have this custom here.

404
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,860
Is this not the Fourth Mistress' idea?

405
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Third sister, don't be angry. Let's eat.

406
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,020
Big sister, let me make this clear.

407
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,140
If my lanterns are lit,

408
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:08,100
I want my food brought to me too.

409
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:12,980
You want to be as foolish?

410
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,660
How does that make our Big sister feel?

411
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,140
What do I matter? I'm just an old woman.

412
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,380
One of these days,
this family will perish in your hands.

413
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,540
Who is playing the flute?

414
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,540
Our young master.
He came back this morning.

415
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,020
Feipu, son of the First Mistress?

416
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,740
I heard he's always away.

417
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,580
He's very busy.

418
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,540
He's going Yunnan in the morning.

419
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,780
Are you Songlian?

420
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,100
You shouldn't call me by my name.

421
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,420
How should I address you? Fourth Mistress?

422
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,300
Did the music bring you here?

423
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,820
Go on, don't let me stop you.

424
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,940
Can you play too?

425
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,940
Feipu, come down here.

426
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,220
My mother wants me. I must go.

427
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,980
Yan'er!

428
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,660
Yan'er!

429
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,460
Come here.

430
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,260
Did you open my suitcase?

431
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,820
Yes, to tidy up your clothes.

432
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,220
Did you see a flute inside?

433
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:25,180
Flute? No. Only men play the flute.

434
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,660
You stole it.

435
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:35,780
Fourth Mistress.
Why would I want to steal it?

436
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,100
You're always sneaking about.
Stop pretending.

437
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,020
Don't blame it on me.

438
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,860
Ask the other mistress.

439
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,260
Have I ever stolen anything?

440
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,380
Fourth Mistress,
I really didn't take your flute!

441
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,060
I didn't!

442
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,460
Fourth Mistress, I didn't!

443
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,780
I didn't take it!

444
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,660
Don't go in! I didn't take your flute!

445
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,740
Then what are you afraid of?

446
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,860
I must take a look!

447
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,300
How dare you light lanterns here!

448
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
You're only a servant!

449
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,340
Don't you know the rules here?

450
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,260
Do you know what could happen to you?

451
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:41,060
I beg you. Don't tell anyone.

452
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,020
Alright, then give me back my flute.

453
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,460
I really didn't take you flute.

454
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,740
Fourth Mistress..

455
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,900
"Songlian."

456
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,700
You've put a curse on me!

457
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:31,740
You want me to die!

458
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:20,820
Don't cry.

459
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,580
I shouldn't treat you this way.

460
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,180
I'll forget what you did.

461
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:40,820
You can't read or write.

462
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,660
Tell me, who wrote my name for you?

463
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,740
I can't tell you.

464
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,740
Don't be afraid. Tell me who wrote it.

465
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,980
I'll keep your secret about the lanterns.

466
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,700
Is it the First Mistress?

467
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,020
Then it must be the Third Mistress.

468
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,380
The Second Mistress? Zhuoyun?

469
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,220
Zhuoyun?

470
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,500
Zhuoyun.

471
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,980
Who are you mad at now?

472
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,900
Where did you put my flute?

473
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,540
I didn't want it to distract you.
I took it away.

474
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,580
Who gave it to you?

475
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,260
It belonged to my father.

476
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:32,260
Sorry for being suspicious.

477
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:36,060
I thought it was one of the boys
at university.

478
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,500
Where is it? Give it back.

479
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:49,180
I had it burnt.

480
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,700
Burnt?

481
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,380
It's only a flute.

482
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,540
I'll tell them to buy
you several good ones.

483
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,420
I hate nothing more than people
throwing tantrums.

484
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,500
Why not go to Zhuoyun?

485
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,180
She always has a smile on.

486
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:33,380
I'm going!

487
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,340
Light the lanterns at the second house!

488
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,020
Fourth sister!

489
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,460
Yan'er said you weren't well.

490
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,500
Are you really sick, or just angry?

491
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,420
What brought you here?

492
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,180
Get up and give me a haircut.

493
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,460
Haircut? I don't know how.

494
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,980
Ask the other sisters.

495
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,940
How can they?

496
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,100
You're better. You went to university.

497
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,900
I want you to cut my hair.

498
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:40,060
Get up! Come!

499
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,260
Why do you suddenly want a haircut?

500
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,940
Didn't the Master spend the night
with me last night?

501
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,020
I told him I was getting old.

502
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,220
Guess what he said?

503
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,820
He said I'd look younger with short hair.

504
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,980
Since he said that,

505
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,460
I must cut my hair.

506
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,900
Go ahead, cut!

507
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,540
I've never done this before.
You may get hurt.

508
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,580
Don't worry. Go ahead.

509
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,860
Alright..

510
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,460
My ear!

511
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,300
My ear!

512
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,100
My ear!

513
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,740
What happened, Second Mistress?

514
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,420
My ear!

515
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,300
My ear!

516
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:36,860
Go away!

517
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,900
What are you looking at? Fetch a doctor!

518
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:57,660
Third sister, what's so funny?

519
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,380
If I hated someone,
I'd cut her ear off too.

520
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:04,900
I'd cut all of it off.

521
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,940
You think I did it deliberately?

522
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,660
Who knows?

523
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,580
Zhuoyun has a Buddha's face
and a scorpion's heart.

524
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,940
She's the true wicked one.

525
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,900
You think I'm against you.

526
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,420
She's the one I hate most.

527
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:52,460
I'm no match for her.

528
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,820
Perhaps you can do better.

529
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,700
I thought so when I first saw you.

530
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,140
Do you know about our giving birth?

531
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:10,060
We both became pregnant
about the same time.

532
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,980
When I was three months along..

533
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:22,060
she slepped some medicine into my food.

534
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:29,740
I was lucky and didn't have a miscarriage.

535
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,780
When we were due,

536
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,380
she wanted to have her baby first..

537
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,340
and ordered expensive injections
to speed up the delivery.

538
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,620
She was in great pain.

539
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,940
In the end, I was lucky..

540
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,060
and had my boy, Feilan.

541
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,740
She only had a cheap little girl..

542
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,500
born three hours after my son.

543
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:18,340
You're new here and the Master
isn't tired of you yet.

544
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,660
But if you don't give him a son..

545
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,340
there will be hard times ahead.

546
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,420
You may be a student and
I'm only an opera singer.

547
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,740
But our fate is the same.

548
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,780
What happened?

549
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:57,380
The Master spent only one night with me..

550
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:00,260
and fourth sister already
hates me so much.

551
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,860
She almost killed me.

552
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:15,220
Doctor Gao said the scissors
just missed my artery.

553
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,700
That serious?

554
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,820
It's your fault.
You said I'd look younger with a haircut.

555
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:32,020
That gave her the idea.

556
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,260
You sisters shouldn't be like this.

557
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:43,220
Alright.
I'll stay with you for a few nights.

558
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,580
Light the lanterns at the second house!

559
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,660
The Fourth Mistress is here.

560
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,060
Fourth sister, you've come.

561
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:04,580
Second sister!

562
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,660
Do sit down.

563
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,420
How are you doing?

564
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,700
Doctor Gao said it wasn't serious.

565
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,260
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it to happen.

566
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,460
Who said you did?

567
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,420
We sisters are friends.

568
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,580
Don't think about it.

569
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,620
It's funny. I should thank you.

570
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,940
If not for you..

571
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,700
the Master wouldn't have
stayed with me.

572
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,340
Softer, Aunt Cao.

573
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,820
If you're alright, I'll be going.

574
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,020
I won't see you to the door.

575
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,980
Yan'er!

576
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:20,900
Yan'er!

577
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,100
What is it, Fourth Mistress?

578
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,260
Where were you?

579
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,380
Come massage my feet.

580
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,860
I don't know how.

581
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,260
You do as I say.

582
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,460
Softer.

583
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,940
I said softer.

584
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:21,740
I said I didn't know how.

585
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:26,220
If you're able, get Aunt Cao to come.

586
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,460
Leave it!

587
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,700
"If I'm able"..
You just wait and see what I can do!

588
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,740
She's really pregnant?

589
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,900
Yes,

590
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,300
Fourth Mistress hasn't been
looking well lately.

591
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,500
Congratulations, Master.
You'll have another son.

592
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,260
According to custom, from today..

593
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,620
the lanterns in this house..

594
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,780
will be lit day and night.

595
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:29,260
Yes, day and night.
As a symbol of longevity.

596
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,580
Go light the lanterns!

597
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:31,220
Fourth Mistress,
drink this lotus seed soup.

598
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,300
Aunt Cao,

599
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,420
someone said I couldn't
get you to serve me.

600
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,220
Who said this about our Fourth Mistress?

601
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:54,020
You're very precious to us now.

602
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,940
Call me anytime and I'll come.

603
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:22,020
First Mistress, I'm bringing the
Fourth Mistress her food.

604
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:37,820
Big sister,

605
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,820
did you do this when you were
pregnant with master Feipu?

606
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,300
Why don't you eat?

607
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,740
Third sister is truly a singer.

608
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,260
Even her laughter sounds like music.

609
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,740
But that's nothing.

610
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,260
If fourth sister has a son..

611
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:06,340
someone will be very unhappy.

612
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,700
All of this food can't shut
both of you up!

613
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,740
Master asks the Second Mistress..

614
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,140
to go to the fourth house after lunch.

615
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,100
Why?

616
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,380
The Fourth Mistress isn't feeling well.

617
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,060
Master wants you to give
her a back massage.

618
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,060
She knows I can massage?

619
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:43,220
Of course the master told her.

620
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,820
It's the Master's idea?

621
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,820
It's his order.

622
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:53,460
Second sister, you must go.

623
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:59,780
Show us how you take good
care of the Master.

624
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,460
If fourth sister feels better,

625
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,260
won't the Master be pleased?

626
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,620
Feeling better?

627
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,500
Much better.

628
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,180
Softer, second sister.

629
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,700
Right, just like this.

630
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:15,300
It can't be! Are you sure it's blood?

631
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,100
It looks like it.

632
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,340
Yan'er!

633
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,260
Yes, Fourth Mistress.

634
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,300
What are you up to?

635
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:50,460
Have you seen my white pants?

636
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,820
I washed them.

637
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:54,060
Washed them?

638
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,580
"How happily they dance
and sing in the sky!"

639
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:06,580
"Lush are the mountain flowers
and the trees high and low!"

640
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,580
"Locked in a golden cage I pine away."

641
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:18,460
"Let me return to the forest to
sing my carefree songs!"

642
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,100
Good, the next poem.

643
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:25,060
"The moon goes down,
crows cry under the frosty sky."

644
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:32,100
"Dimly lit fishing boats beneath
maples sadly lie."

645
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:35,540
"Beyond the Gusu walls
the Temple of Cold Hill."

646
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,860
"Ringing bells reach my boat,
breaking the midnight still."

647
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,220
Well done!

648
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,220
Master, the Second Mistress
wishes to see you.

649
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:45,820
Master.

650
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:52,100
Fourth sister seems very tired lately.

651
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,700
When I was pregnant..

652
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,860
I nearly had a miscarriage
and didn't even know it.

653
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,740
You should ask Doctor Gao to come.

654
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,980
Thank you for reminding me.

655
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:10,820
Tomorrow, ask Doctor Gao
to visit the Fourth Mistress.

656
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:11,780
Yes, Master.

657
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:16,460
Doctor Gao has finished?

658
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:17,380
Finished.

659
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,340
Thank you, doctor.

660
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,620
Where is the Master? I must speak to him.

661
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,820
Please follow me.

662
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:26,820
Doctor Gao..

663
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,660
you're here.

664
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,460
Third Mistress,

665
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,420
are you better after taking my medicine?

666
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:41,100
Much better. Only I can't sleep at night.

667
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,500
When I've time,
I'll change the prescription.

668
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:47,620
Fine.

669
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,260
How is fourth sister?

670
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,780
I can't explain now. I'll tell you later.

671
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,060
Doctor Gao!

672
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,660
Second Mistress!

673
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:05,940
How is fourth sister? Not serious, is it?

674
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,100
I've got to see the master first.

675
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,020
Sorry for troubling you, doctor.

676
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:18,300
Not at all.

677
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,300
Please have some tea.

678
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,140
How is fourth sister?

679
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:38,500
I don't know if I should be frank.

680
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,220
Go, leave us alone.

681
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:01,020
Is anything wrong with Songlian?

682
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:09,060
Master,
the Fourth Mistress isn't pregnant.

683
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,420
What? Is it true?

684
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,500
I checked carefully.

685
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,700
She isn't pregnant.

686
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,860
You're trying to cheat me?

687
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:31,820
Tell me, why did you lie?

688
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:36,580
Don't you know we've rules in this family?

689
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,940
Rules we've been following..

690
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,900
for many generations!

691
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,420
How dare you!

692
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,860
- Cover the lanterns!
- What did you say, Master?

693
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,100
Cover the lanterns!

694
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,620
Cover the lanterns!

695
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:15,980
Yan'er..

696
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:21,700
Why did Doctor Gao come all of a sudden?

697
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,340
Where are my white pants?

698
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,180
I'll fetch them.

699
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,900
A servant secretly
lighting lanterns in her room!

700
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,340
Who let you put lanterns here?

701
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,700
Who do you think you are?

702
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,300
Have you no respect for the mistresses?

703
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,700
Does this family have rules or not?

704
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,500
Stop making a scene!

705
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,900
Don't act like one of the servants.

706
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,820
No, this is one of your rules.

707
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,460
Rules are rules,

708
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,140
but everyone can make mistakes.

709
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:38,340
Let me remind you that they've
just covered your lanterns.

710
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,220
But I am still a mistress.

711
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:46,100
Mistresses are mistresses!
Maids are maids!

712
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,940
Big sister, the Master is away..

713
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,500
In front of everyone here..

714
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:56,180
you be the judge.

715
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:59,100
I broke a rule and they
covered my lanterns.

716
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:04,020
What happens if a servant breaks the rule?

717
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,220
Follow the old custom!

718
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:42,580
The First Mistress said..

719
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:49,660
you could get up if you apologized.

720
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:51,620
Why do this?

721
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,420
Have her drink this hot ginger tea.

722
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,820
It'll make her sweat.

723
01:27:28,980 --> 01:27:30,260
Has the doctor come?

724
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,980
He came several times
but she isn't improving.

725
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,180
The Master's back.

726
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,900
Said to send her to the hospital.

727
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,340
Who could tell the Fourth Mistress
would be so vicious?

728
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,380
Yan'er shouldn't have made her angry.

729
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,540
- Housekeeper.
- Yes, Master.

730
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:58,260
Get her good medicine.
Never mind the money.

731
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:01,380
Or people will say we let our servant die.

732
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:02,980
Yes, Master.

733
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,220
Light the lanterns at the second house!

734
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,980
Fourth sister,
what are you doing here so early?

735
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,740
I've come to listen to third sister sing.

736
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:39,940
You sing so well.

737
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:46,700
Good or bad, it's all playacting.

738
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,580
If you play well, you fool the others.

739
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,300
If you play badly,
you can only fool yourself.

740
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,260
If you can't even fool yourself,

741
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:57,060
you can fool the ghosts.

742
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:00,860
People breathe, ghosts cannot.
That's the only difference.

743
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:05,260
People are ghosts, and ghosts are people.

744
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:10,220
Don't mind me for saying this..

745
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,300
but you shouldn't have made
such a fuss about Yan'er.

746
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:18,900
She's only dreaming of
becoming a mistress.

747
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,180
She's only scapegoat.
I was after someone else.

748
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:28,740
Yes, she's only a maid.

749
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,540
Someone is behind her.

750
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,140
Look how pleased Zhuoyun was last night.

751
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:40,100
She thinks she's so smart.
I'll take care of her soon!

752
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:45,500
Light the lanterns, blow out the lanterns,
cover the lanterns.

753
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,940
What do I care?

754
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:53,940
What do people amount to in this house?

755
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,740
They're like dogs, cats or rats.

756
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:01,620
But certainly not people.

757
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,420
Isn't it better to hang
yourself in that room?

758
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:11,140
Don't talk about dying.

759
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,980
Why think about what people are like?
Just go on living.

760
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,260
Don't be so unhappy.

761
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:29,620
Look at me. I always keep myself amused.

762
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,580
Of course you're happy.

763
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,020
You've got Doctor Gao.

764
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:40,940
What do you mean by that?

765
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:43,940
Nothing.

766
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,060
I should thank him for coming to see me.

767
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:52,420
Don't joke about this.

768
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,820
If you tell anyone,

769
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,500
you'll have me to deal with.

770
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:04,180
To be honest, I'm meeting him soon.

771
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:06,100
What can they do to me?

772
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,740
Fourth Mistress..

773
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,940
You frightened me.

774
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,900
I thought nobody was here.

775
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:44,380
Master said I'd be your maid from now on.

776
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:50,900
I may be old, but I'm experienced.

777
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:53,940
Not like those young girls.

778
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,740
Get me some wine.

779
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,460
What? I didn't hear you.

780
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:04,740
Bring me some wine. Today's my brithday.

781
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:06,900
Your birthday?

782
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,660
How old are you?

783
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,580
Twenty.

784
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:14,380
Why didn't you say so earlier?

785
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:15,740
I'll get the wine.

786
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:23,140
The wine is here.

787
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,700
Why are you looking at me that way?

788
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,460
Yan'er is dead.

789
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,860
She died in the hospital.

790
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,060
When?

791
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:53,540
I don't know.

792
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:59,380
They said she died calling your name.

793
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:06,260
Why? Did she think I killed her?

794
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,780
I'm only repeating what they said.

795
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,620
She can't blame you. It's her destiny.

796
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:18,460
Where is she now?

797
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,900
Her family took the body
back to the village.

798
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:29,340
They were all crying. It was very sad.

799
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,780
Why cry?

800
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:51,180
It's better dead than alive and suffering.

801
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,660
She's lucky to have died.

802
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:58,460
Fourth Mistress, stop drinking!
You're drunk!

803
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:02,740
I'm happy today. It's my birthday.

804
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:06,780
My twentieth birthday.

805
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,980
Young master, you're back?

806
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:13,140
Please talk to the Fourth Mistress.

807
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:15,140
She's drunk!

808
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:20,100
You're back, young master.

809
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,980
Why are you drinking?

810
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:24,340
Sit down.

811
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,220
I'm celebrating my birthday.

812
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:35,780
Have a drink. Congratulate me.

813
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:47,140
Alright, I'll have some.

814
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,220
May you live to be 99.

815
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:56,580
Nonsense! I don't want to live that long.

816
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,540
Save such wishes for your father.

817
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,780
I heard what happened.

818
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:10,020
You're so foolish.

819
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,780
How long could you lie
about being pregnant?

820
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,820
Foolish? I'm not foolish.

821
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:25,020
I had it planned. At first it was a lie.

822
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:28,420
But if the Master stayed with me,

823
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,740
soon it would be true.

824
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,740
I was planning this,
but they were plotting against me.

825
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:43,460
Everyone is plotting against each other.

826
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,380
What is the meaning of all this?

827
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:53,580
This is from Yunnan.

828
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:55,660
Take it as your birthday gift.

829
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:05,580
Only women give this to men.

830
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,180
Not the other way around.

831
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:15,100
Don't want it? Never mind.
Someone gave it to me.

832
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:22,780
Hypocrite! Which woman gave it to you?

833
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,780
If I take it, won't my hands be soiled?

834
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:34,420
I was just fooling. Wasn't really
going to let you have it.

835
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:40,340
Fooling? I'm used to being fooled.

836
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,100
Everyone is fooling me.

837
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:48,060
And now you?

838
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:58,060
Get out! Get out of here!

839
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,500
Feipu!

840
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:13,980
I'm going.

841
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,300
Master! Master!

842
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,340
Fourth Mistress, please stop!

843
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,540
Why is she drinking?

844
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:51,060
She wants to drink.

845
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,380
Ask the first Mistress for
medicine to sober her up!

846
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:58,820
Don't go to that old witch!

847
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,420
See how crazy you look!

848
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,260
People will laugh!

849
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:08,380
What is there to laugh at?

850
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,660
The Master likes you.

851
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,580
Meishan has gone to meet
her good-looking doctor.

852
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:17,660
What do I have? I've nothing! Nothing!

853
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:19,580
Where is Meishan?

854
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,820
She's meeting the good-looking doctor.

855
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:29,020
What do I have? Nothing!

856
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:31,700
When did the Third Mistress go out?

857
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:33,500
I don't know.

858
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:38,220
What am I afraid of? Nothing!

859
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,620
Big sister!

860
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,500
The medicine is here. Make her drink it.

861
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:51,460
I won't! I'm not drunk!

862
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,500
Don't just stand there!

863
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,700
Hold that crazy woman!

864
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:58,020
Hold her down! Quick!

865
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:07,380
Get out!

866
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:14,300
Let her scream!
Let her make a fool of herself!

867
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:17,020
The Master's away and she's
turned the house upside down!

868
01:42:55,740 --> 01:42:57,740
Fourth sister, are you sober now?

869
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:02,980
I'm glad you told me yesterday.

870
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,820
Or there would be such a scandal!

871
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:10,100
It's cold here. Go back to your room.

872
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:20,860
What happened?

873
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:28,180
The Third Mistress and Doctor Gao
were in a hotel in town.

874
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,420
When the Second Mistress
had the door opened..

875
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,700
they were still in bed.

876
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,580
Such sin!

877
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:40,260
Did the Second Mistress say I told her?

878
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:48,100
You told her when you
were drunk yesterday.

879
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:51,820
I was so shocked.

880
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,460
I said it?

881
01:43:58,780 --> 01:44:00,140
You did.

882
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:03,940
I wondered why you told her.

883
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,460
Is it that you hate the doctor?

884
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:11,260
You drank a lot yesterday.
You can't remember.

885
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,220
What will happen to the Third sister?

886
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,740
They've gone to fetch the Master.

887
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:27,580
What must happen.. will happen.

888
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:32,380
Go and rest. Or you'll catch cold.

889
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:37,940
Such heavy snow! Must be a bad year!

890
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,220
Murderers!

891
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:21,180
Murderers!

892
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:30,060
Murderers!

893
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:51,620
The Master is here.

894
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,780
- Master
- Master

895
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,940
The Master is back.

896
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:12,340
What did you see?

897
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:14,860
You murderers!

898
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,780
Meishan is dead. You murderers!

899
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:23,220
Nonsense! What did you see?

900
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,420
You didn't see a thing!

901
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:29,020
Murderers! You murderers!

902
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:34,180
You're mad! You're gone mad!

903
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:41,260
Murderers.. You murderers!

904
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,740
Housekeeper!

905
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:57,820
Housekeeper!

906
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:03,380
Housekeeper! The lanterns are lit!

907
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:04,540
What happened?

908
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:09,060
The lanterns in the third house are lit!

909
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:09,940
What.. What?

910
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:10,740
Where?

911
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:11,740
It's haunted!

912
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:15,420
It's the Third Mistress' ghost!

913
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:10,660
The Third Mistress is singing!

914
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,980
It's haunted!

915
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:56,300
The housekeeper congratulates
the Fifth Mistress on her wedding.

916
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:34,620
Who is that?

917
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:39,380
She was our Fourth Mistress.
She has gone mad.

918
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:00,000
