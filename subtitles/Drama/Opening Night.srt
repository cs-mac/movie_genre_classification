1
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,627
That's the way she wants it.
She likes to be wet. Right, Miss Gordon?

2
00:00:17,697 --> 00:00:22,032
Bobby, I want you to fix these packages.
They sound like sandpaper rubbing together.

3
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,263
Want me to wet 'em down?
Okay.

4
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>- You have enough water on your hair?
- Perfect.</i>

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,301
Would you like a little drink while
you're preparing, a little bourbon?

6
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:38,042
<i>I'd love that.</i>

7
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:23,384
- What are you thinking about?
- Oh, you're home?

8
00:01:23,464 --> 00:01:25,395
Am I home?

9
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,296
- Oh, God. I'm -
- What do you mean am I home?

10
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,301
Soaking.

11
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:34,203
It's raining out there.
My feet are chunks of ice.

12
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:38,267
You know, a funny thing, in Los Angeles
almost everybody has cold feet.

13
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:42,006
- Oh. No jokes, please.
- No jokes? Really?

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,482
How about gentle humor?
Like to hear an anecdote?

15
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,385
How about an anecdote?
Did you see my kid?

16
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:52,447
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Oh, that's nice, Marty.

17
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:55,858
Yeah, I'm giving up older people.

18
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,520
Can't photograph them
without their clothes on.

19
00:02:01,332 --> 00:02:03,324
- I love you.
- Where were you?

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,335
Oh, I was out -
I don't know.

21
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,870
You know, shopping and -

22
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:10,534
Then I stopped for a drink.

23
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:13,772
Went into a bar.
Shouldn't have done that.

24
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,777
Ah. A lot of people? Men?

25
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:19,250
Yeah, but they were all talking about
their children, so I figured it was okay.

26
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,480
I don't trust people that -

27
00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:26,452
that talk about their children.

28
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,753
- Oh?
- They're perverted.

29
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,799
But I tell you,
I do love older people.

30
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,060
Look at this dame.

31
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,730
- You know why I love older people?
- Why?

32
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:42,397
'Cause they know everything.

33
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,069
But they don't show
that they know everything.

34
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:49,978
I can stand here, I can look
at this woman, this old lady...

35
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:53,448
and I can count
every wrinkle on her face.

36
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,545
And for every wrinkle,
there's a pain.

37
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:58,246
And for every pain,
there's a year.

38
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:01,019
And for every year,
there's a person, there's a death...

39
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,082
there's a history,
and there's a kindness.

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:09,101
Now, you look at this kid over here.
She's not kind, see?

41
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,933
What am I holding you up for?
Go on, get upstairs. Get warm.

42
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,700
I love you.

43
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:17,709
- Virginia?
- What?

44
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:19,867
- Can you hear me?
- What?

45
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:23,209
- Thank you.
- For what?

46
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,213
For coming home.

47
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,854
<i>They want to be loved.</i>

48
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,455
<i>They have to be loved.</i>

49
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,459
<i>The whole world.</i>

50
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:14,522
<i>Everybody wants to be loved.</i>

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,740
<i>When I was 17,
I- I could do anything.</i>

52
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,809
<i>It was so easy. My emotions
were so close to the surface.</i>

53
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:37,483
<i>I'm finding it...</i>

54
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:42,581
<i>harder and harder
to stay in touch.</i>

55
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:49,790
<i>Think about it, will you?</i>

56
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,767
<i>I'm not mad at you.</i>

57
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,466
<i>You could hit me.</i>

58
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,531
<i>I'm not mad at you.</i>

59
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:01,374
<i>Think about it.
You can hit me.</i>

60
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,250
- How you feel?
- Fine.

61
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,124
- Had a good night tonight.
- Yep.

62
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,496
- Give me your hat.
- Kelly, get me a bottle. I need a drink.

63
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,864
<i>- A little one or a big one?
- A big one.</i>

64
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,199
- It's nice to be loved.
- I'm entitled.

65
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:43,208
Bobby, you got a bottle?

66
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,390
<i>Come on, let's put the towel on.</i>

67
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,554
<i>Does she need
a little bit more water on the hair?</i>

68
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,498
You can do it on the way in. You've got
plenty of time. Hurry up and wait.

69
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,693
- Okay, let's do it.
- You got everything?

70
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,876
<i>Come on. One autograph?</i>

71
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,878
- No.
- Sign the damned thing.

72
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,106
- Who belongs to this?
- Thank you.

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,945
I'm gonna get a cab.
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

74
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:31,497
Miss Sarah Goode? I've seen every one
of your plays here in New Haven.

75
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,729
Would you please?
I think they're wonderful.

76
00:06:33,804 --> 00:06:37,796
How interesting. You've seen
every one of my plays in New Haven.

77
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,810
He's seen every one
of my plays in New Haven.

78
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,809
Well, that's remarkable.
Thank you very much.

79
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,811
- May I have your autograph?
- I'm just the producer.

80
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,347
Sign it, David.

81
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:52,988
- Thank you. How did you like my show?
- I loved the show.

82
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,048
Yeah, thank you.

83
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,664
- I'm not the star of the show.
- I know about them.

84
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:11,968
Myrtle is the star of the show.
Myrtle Gordon.

85
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,043
Miss Gordon!

86
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,983
<i>- I love you! I love you!
- Come on, cool it.</i>

87
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,233
Back up. Everybody
will get their moment.

88
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:40,234
Just back up.
Hold it a second.

89
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:44,101
- I love you.
- Sweetheart.

90
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,871
Sweetheart.
Off your knees, darling.

91
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:51,038
- What's your name?
- Miss Gordon, would you please sign -

92
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,877
- What's your name?
- Nancy.

93
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,884
Nancy? How old are you?

94
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,817
Seventeen.

95
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,914
- Oh, my God.
- All right, thank you.

96
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:03,960
Thank you. Let's go.
Please, people, let us through, huh?

97
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:07,451
I'm - I'm sorry.

98
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,552
<i>I love you. I love you!</i>

99
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:11,895
<i>Darling, let go ofher, please!</i>

100
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,903
Come on. Let's go.

101
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:22,203
- All right.
- Get in the car. Get in.

102
00:08:25,582 --> 00:08:27,550
- You all right?
- Yeah, fine.

103
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,753
Manny, roll the window down, will ya?
There's something wrong with that kid.

104
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,232
<i>Get out of the rain, will ya?
You're gonna get pneumonia.</i>

105
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,601
Come see me tomorrow, okay?

106
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:23,802
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

107
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:27,038
<i>I think it's that kid.</i>

108
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,288
I think it's that kid.

109
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:42,114
It's that -
I think she's -

110
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:44,126
Stop the car!
What are we doing?

111
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:05,638
Bring the umbrella!
Get an ambulance! Get an ambulance!

112
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:08,580
Hurry up! Hurry up!

113
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,621
- Open the door, Manny. I've gotta get out.
- Let me handle it, will ya?

114
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,434
<i>- Hello? Hello?
- Can I help you?</i>

115
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:27,695
Listen, there's been an accident
in front of the theater.

116
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,260
I want you to call the police
and be sure that they know it.

117
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,363
- We've gotta eat.
- The Orpheum Theater.

118
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,375
- We gotta eat.
- What?

119
00:10:34,443 --> 00:10:36,808
The last restaurant's gonna close.

120
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:40,006
You're gonna be hungry later.

121
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:43,412
Maurice, will you come up with me, please?
I feel a little shaky.

122
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,433
Thanks.

123
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,139
- I'm not staying.
- Have one drink.

124
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,379
Come in.

125
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,789
Oh, God.

126
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,996
Don't be so distant, Maurice.
Come on, have a drink.

127
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,106
I'm hungry.

128
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:52,347
<i>There are people waiting
downstairs in the car.</i>

129
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,580
What's the matter with us?

130
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,191
We lose sight of everything.
There was a girl killed tonight.

131
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,195
All we can think about is dinner.

132
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,069
I gotta go.

133
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:29,387
You're not a woman
to me anymore.

134
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,050
You're a professional.

135
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,924
You don't care
about anything, do you?

136
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,431
You don't care
about personal relationships...

137
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,765
Iove, sex, affection.

138
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:44,826
- Okay.
- I have a small part.

139
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:48,301
It's unsympathetic.
The audience doesn't like me.

140
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:50,709
I can't afford to be
in love with you.

141
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,949
Good night.

142
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,750
Yeah, good night.

143
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:06,052
- She coming?
- She doesn't wanna eat.

144
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,054
She'll beat herself into the ground.

145
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,057
Let's go. My wife is
waiting at the restaurant.

146
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,491
I don't want any more trouble.
Let's go.

147
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,993
I need your help, Dorothy.

148
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,725
<i>I'm not talking to you as your husband.
I don't count.</i>

149
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,030
<i>But I'm gonna go crazy
if you don't tell me what it's like...</i>

150
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:23,034
<i>to be alone as a woman.</i>

151
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:28,301
<i>What do you do?
Okay, that's it.</i>

152
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,604
Will you make me another drink,
please? I am gonna get drunk.

153
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,347
<i>- Ah -
- If you want to get hostile, go ahead.</i>

154
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,348
<i>My goddamn life depends on this play.</i>

155
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:50,228
<i>And you should go to all the rehearsals.
You should watch everything.</i>

156
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:54,289
You should sit with Myrtle, fill her in
on yourself and be part of it.

157
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,593
Do I get paid for this?

158
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:02,974
If you understudy, I'll pay you.

159
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,009
<i>Hmm.</i>

160
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:15,319
<i>That's right.</i>

161
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:20,225
'Cause I tell you, my life is getting
boring. I'm getting somber.

162
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:24,358
<i>- My own tricks bore me.
- Do you want ice?</i>

163
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,364
<i>Yeah.</i>

164
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,738
<i>There's no humor anymore,
and all the glamour's dead.</i>

165
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:37,575
<i>- You notice that?
- Mm-mmm.</i>

166
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:40,477
I can't even stand
how they come to rehearsal.

167
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:42,913
They come to rehearsal
dressed in terrible clothes.

168
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:48,082
<i>- Ah.
- Manny, I'm dying.</i>

169
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,322
I'm dying.

170
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:56,085
I know I'm dying,
'cause I'm getting tired.

171
00:15:57,997 --> 00:16:00,557
<i>It's always the same.</i>

172
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,794
You talk. I sleep.

173
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:11,506
If I had known what a boring man
you were when I married you...

174
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,568
I wouldn't have gone through
all those emotional crises.

175
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:12,196
Hello?

176
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:14,294
Oh, Myrtle.

177
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,170
No, sweetheart.
I'm still up.

178
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,680
<i>I'm sorry you're not feeling well.</i>

179
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,408
<i>Do you have a fever?</i>

180
00:17:23,482 --> 00:17:25,416
<i>What?</i>

181
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:27,417
<i>What girl?</i>

182
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:33,118
<i>Ayoung girl got killed
in front of the theater tonight.</i>

183
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:38,394
<i>- All right, sweetheart.
- It's 4:30 in the morning.</i>

184
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:41,729
Yes, I know. It is lonely.

185
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh! I hate out of town too.

186
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,172
<i>Of course I love you.</i>

187
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:56,440
Hold it, will you, please?

188
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,417
It's nothing.
Just my wife.

189
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,578
Right.

190
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,148
Of course I'll leave the phone open.

191
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:09,591
Yeah. She doesn't mind at all.

192
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:13,154
- Tell her you'll talk
to her in the morning.
- I don't sleep anyway.

193
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,722
- Right.
- Right?

194
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:19,965
- Right.
- There's no one I love more
than you at this moment.

195
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,899
You know I love you.

196
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,174
What?

197
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,581
Yes, sweetheart. Okay.

198
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,315
What's wrong with being slapped?

199
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,325
Cut it out. Cut it out.
Just a second, darling.

200
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:43,519
Cut it out, will you, please?

201
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,532
There's nothing
humiliating about it.

202
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:49,260
You're on the stage,
for Christ's sake.

203
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,826
<i>He's not slapping you for real.</i>

204
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,974
<i>Myrtle.</i>

205
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,344
<i>Ugh! Myrtle!</i>

206
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:06,280
<i>Myrtle, it has nothing to do
with being a woman.</i>

207
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,285
<i>You're not a woman anyway.</i>

208
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,788
<i>No, no. You're a beautiful woman.</i>

209
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:15,622
<i>You are. I was kidding.</i>

210
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:19,688
<i>Now, you see? You have no
sense of humor. I told you that.</i>

211
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,431
I don't want to argue with it,
darling. We'll rehearse it.

212
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,564
Well, how -
If we don't rehearse it...

213
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:30,405
we -we won't get it.

214
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,168
But it's not humiliating.
There's nothing humiliating about it.

215
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:39,581
Uh, you know, it's a tradition.
Actresses get slapped.

216
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:44,020
It's a tradition.
Do you want to be a, uh, uh...

217
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:46,821
a star or do you want to be
unsympathetic?

218
00:19:46,892 --> 00:19:49,222
<i>It's mandatory you get hit.
That's it.</i>

219
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,488
<i>Now go to sleep. Right.</i>

220
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,932
Ayoung girl got killed
by the theater tonight.

221
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,493
Let's forget it.
Let's not phony it up anymore.

222
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:03,770
Myrtle, honest to God,
he's not gonna hurt you.

223
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:07,244
Now, look. You do it to me.

224
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,246
Come on. Do it to me.

225
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:12,514
Here, loosen the hand. Ready?

226
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,246
You hear that?
One more time.

227
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,345
Okay, now hit Maurice.

228
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,559
Good! Good!

229
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:26,191
All right, we could do it, but...

230
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,893
you know, he could
swing at you and miss...

231
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,900
but then we wouldn't
hear the slap.

232
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,597
So, try it one more time.

233
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:38,072
Hit her in the face.
With the fingers, not the palm.

234
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:40,872
- Go ahead.
- No!

235
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,816
Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle.

236
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,044
- Hit me -
- Myrtle, Myrtle, Myrtle.

237
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,449
Take it easy, will ya?

238
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,454
What's the matter with you?

239
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,150
- Look, do I love you?
- Yes.

240
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:56,158
- Do I want you to be good?
- Yes.

241
00:20:56,227 --> 00:20:58,055
- Would I hurt you?
- No.

242
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,393
<i>Then you're gonna
have to let me slap you.</i>

243
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:03,094
<i>- Okay.
- It won't work if you don't.</i>

244
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,192
All right?

245
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,262
Okay.

246
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:09,397
Let's go. From, uh...

247
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,738
where, Sarah?

248
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,404
<i>Uh, start with
"You don't get to me."</i>

249
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:16,505
- Okay.
- Places, please.

250
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:24,616
<i>You don't get to me.</i>

251
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,623
<i>You want to get to me?
You don't get to me.</i>

252
00:21:26,692 --> 00:21:29,217
There's no way for you to get to me.

253
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:33,030
You want to go out
and get drunk?

254
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,134
You want to take dope?

255
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,132
You want to go out with some guy
at 4:00 in the afternoon...

256
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,642
and be with him?

257
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:47,873
Go ahead.
That's you're problem.

258
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,148
What a mess I am.

259
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,085
I'm begging again.

260
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,519
What are we fighting about?

261
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:01,648
You want to be young again,
is that it?

262
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:03,990
Oh, Marty.

263
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,996
Ahh!

264
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:11,270
Oh, that was -
Oh, wow.

265
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:16,930
Uh, that was good.
That was good.

266
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:25,780
<i>A few lines back.</i>

267
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:35,691
No! No more!

268
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,627
No!

269
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:46,296
<i>Bravo!</i>

270
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:50,898
<i>No! No! No more!</i>

271
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:53,636
<i>No! No!</i>

272
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,105
- You all right?
- No!

273
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,491
- I didn't hit her.
- Walk away.

274
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:20,563
<i>I didn't hit her, David, really.</i>

275
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:31,773
<i>- You all right, Myrtle?
- Do we need a doctor?</i>

276
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:34,338
Yeah, you'd better get a doctor
and get me a cold compress...

277
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,752
and maybe you'll have
a little brandy back there.

278
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:41,284
David, would you please leave
the stage so we can go on?

279
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,523
<i>Will you get off the stage?</i>

280
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,601
<i>There's nothing the matter with Myrtle.
She's, uh, tired, that's all.</i>

281
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,196
<i>I've been tired
a lot of times in my life.</i>

282
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,698
<i>You stay up all night,
you get tired!</i>

283
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:04,906
<i>All right, Myrtle. Time to get up.
Have to rehearse now.</i>

284
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:10,152
<i>Uh, let's take it
from a few lines back.</i>

285
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:13,884
<i>- You want me to try this again?
- Yeah.</i>

286
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:18,518
Well, how can I start again when
she's lying half-dead on the floor?

287
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:21,085
<i>Myrtle!</i>

288
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,725
<i>Are we rehearsing here or not?</i>

289
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:28,496
<i>Want to call it a day?</i>

290
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:31,607
<i>Myrtle!</i>

291
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,342
I was very much
in love with you, Virginia.

292
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:48,157
When was that?

293
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:52,320
No, I really want to know.
When?

294
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,933
You don't get to me.

295
00:24:57,969 --> 00:25:00,460
You want to get to me?
You don't get to me.

296
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:05,964
There is no way
for you to get to me.

297
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,878
You want to go out and take dope?
You want to get drunk? Go ahead.

298
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:13,347
<i>You want to -</i>

299
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,042
Oh!

300
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,156
Pow!

301
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:40,899
Do you expect to be
funny in this scene?

302
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,276
I'm sorry. I, uh -

303
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:52,080
Perhaps I could write
a funny line for you.

304
00:25:59,928 --> 00:26:02,423
She's very alien to me.

305
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:11,603
And I would pray that
I could have something to say...

306
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,841
that would make sense.

307
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:22,111
<i>So that I could make sense.</i>

308
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,182
I somehow -

309
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:32,561
I seem to have lost
the, uh, the reality of-

310
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:34,565
of the, uh -

311
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,734
reality.

312
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,092
I -

313
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:46,134
I dream funny dreams too.

314
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,077
I'm not myself.

315
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,049
<i>This woman you're playing...</i>

316
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:56,051
<i>is as helpless as you are...</i>

317
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,484
<i>and as helpless as I am.</i>

318
00:26:58,554 --> 00:27:00,580
<i>She has no weapons.</i>

319
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,357
<i>She wants to fall in love, but...</i>

320
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,259
<i>her time has passed.</i>

321
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,489
<i>It's too late.
It's as simple as that.</i>

322
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:12,624
<i>You understand
that part of it, don't you?</i>

323
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:17,033
How old are you, Myrtle?

324
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,868
<i>You see? It's too late.</i>

325
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:24,278
You understand that, don't you?

326
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:31,013
Just please tell me
what this play doesn't express.

327
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:36,223
Hope.

328
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:43,258
All right, uh, we'll, uh -

329
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,625
Pick this up later.
Let's start with Act I, Scene One.

330
00:27:47,703 --> 00:27:49,638
<i>All right, Jimmy.</i>

331
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:51,729
<i>Let's get set here.</i>

332
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:12,554
Bring it down! Come on.

333
00:28:15,331 --> 00:28:17,390
That's it. That's it.

334
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,402
<i>Come on, places, please. Let's go.</i>

335
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:22,958
<i>Put it on the money. Bring it in.
- Bring it down!</i>

336
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:38,481
Would you shut the door
on your way out, please?

337
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:40,489
Sure.

338
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,311
What's up?

339
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,656
Be nice.

340
00:30:57,825 --> 00:30:59,849
May I sit down?

341
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,198
There's no sense
in us being enemies.

342
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,200
But I can't be your friend...

343
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:11,034
if I have to contend
with your retirement.

344
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:14,096
Oh, I don't think
we'll ever be friends.

345
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:17,010
Well, we'll just have
to live with that.

346
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:24,085
You know, that was a very good point
you made about hope.

347
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:30,422
Made me realize that
you're not completely stupid.

348
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,388
People change... physically.

349
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,931
<i>There's a hell of a lot of
pressure one puts on oneself...</i>

350
00:31:41,003 --> 00:31:43,866
<i>by demanding
to stay competitive.</i>

351
00:32:03,524 --> 00:32:05,855
I'm gonna hit you.

352
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,859
You're calling me fat?

353
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:13,399
Beautiful day.

354
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,799
What do you want to do?
You want to walk?

355
00:32:16,872 --> 00:32:19,637
- You want to ride?
- I don't care.

356
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,368
Oh, I hate actresses.

357
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,644
She tried to talk to me about age.

358
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,841
Now I ask you. Really.

359
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:32,576
Come on, walk with us.

360
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,421
All right, we're gonna walk.

361
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:53,070
I think it -
that went very well.

362
00:32:58,012 --> 00:33:00,275
Excuse me.

363
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:03,782
Thank you.

364
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,918
So.

365
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:13,455
- Well.
- Do you want to have a drink?

366
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,926
- You guys?
- Yeah. Good idea.

367
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:19,397
Hold on. Wait for me.

368
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,960
- Myrtle?
- Myrtle?

369
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,946
- Come on. Have a drink, sweetheart.
- Manny, I just can't.

370
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:39,380
- Are these all the local newspapers?
- Yes, ma'am.

371
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,717
<i>- Are you all right?
- Sure.</i>

372
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:45,851
<i>- These are today's, aren't they?
- Yes, these are the morning...</i>

373
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:49,486
<i>- and those are the afternoon.
- Okay.</i>

374
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,692
Would you put those
on my bill, please?

375
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,791
Certainly, Miss Gordon.

376
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:01,270
- What's wrong?
- Five, please.

377
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:07,004
- Do I have any mail?
- One moment, please.

378
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:14,180
<i>Nothing. Would you like a key?</i>

379
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:38,974
- Baruch.
- Baruch.

380
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:40,536
- Atah.
- Atah.

381
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:42,102
- Adonai.
- Adonai.

382
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:43,840
<i>- Eloheinu.
- Eloheinu.</i>

383
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,577
<i>- Melech.
- Melech.</i>

384
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:47,584
- Ha'olam.
- Ha'olam.

385
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,781
<i>- Dayan.
- Dayan.</i>

386
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,051
<i>- Ha'emet.
- Ha'emet.</i>

387
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:55,651
<i>- Praise be thou, O God.
- Praise be, O God.</i>

388
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,163
<i>- Righteous judge.
- Righteous judge.</i>

389
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:01,099
- Amen.
- Amen.

390
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:12,935
All right. It'll be all right.

391
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,417
I'm Myrtle Gordon.

392
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:21,919
<i>- Eddie, I'm so sorry.
- Excuse me, but this happens to be...</i>

393
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,751
<i>a very, very bad time for us.</i>

394
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,122
Please be quiet.
Take it easy.

395
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:32,192
<i>I lost my daughter today.
You must forgive us.</i>

396
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,427
I know who you are.

397
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,802
At another time, this house would've
been bedlam had you paid a visit.

398
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:40,805
<i>Come in.</i>

399
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,982
<i>She was trying to see you.
That's how it happened.</i>

400
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:51,981
Yes, she was very beautiful.
I did see her.

401
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:57,248
<i>- She had extraordinary eyes.
- You don't have children.</i>

402
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,451
If you had,
you wouldn't have come here.

403
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,957
No, I don't.
I don't have children.

404
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,511
<i>Can I freshen you up
a little bit, Miss Gordon?</i>

405
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:33,422
<i>Uh, yeah, butjust one more.
I've got a show to do tonight.</i>

406
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:38,154
<i>Listen, I don't want to impose upon you,
but this joker's been begging me to get
a couple autographs for his kids.</i>

407
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,255
Would you mind terribly?

408
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:44,167
- No, that's fine.
- Fantastic. There you are.

409
00:36:44,238 --> 00:36:47,568
- I told you she was a fantastic broad.
- Great. Thank you, Miss Gordon.

410
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:51,040
<i>Thanks.</i>

411
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,849
<i>- How are you, Kelly?
- Workin'. Hangin'up clothes.</i>

412
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:05,481
You're looking good.

413
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,681
<i>Well, we all have to please.</i>

414
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,250
<i>We have to please our audiences.
Isn't that right, Mr. Victor?</i>

415
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,195
That's right, that's right.
Very intelligent.

416
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,738
Hey.

417
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,837
You're not funny anymore.

418
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:28,073
<i>It's a serious play, Manny.</i>

419
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:31,480
<i>Look at that. Isn't that wonderful?
She knows it's a serious play.</i>

420
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:37,681
I mean it.
You're not funny anymore.

421
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,892
You used to break me up.

422
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:44,521
That's right. I'd just have to look at you.
I'd fall on the floor laughing.

423
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,621
But you've changed.

424
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,630
Your whole countenance has changed.

425
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,634
<i>You're like some proud queen.</i>

426
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,406
<i>I think you're in line
for a few bad habits.</i>

427
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,203
<i>So I'm gonna take you
out after the show.</i>

428
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:59,540
<i>Then I'm gonna take off
all my clothes...</i>

429
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,547
<i>and show you this beautiful body.</i>

430
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,574
<i>Hey.</i>

431
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,417
You're the most exciting woman
that I've ever known.

432
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:12,479
And the greatest actress.

433
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:16,221
- But you're no fun anymore.
- It's a sad play. She didn't write it.

434
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,819
<i>Sit down, will ya, please?</i>

435
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:23,062
Look in the mirror. Am I beginning
to look like Humphrey Bogart to you?

436
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,626
- Now, wait a minute. Let's discuss that.
- No, answer the question.

437
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,037
<i>- Am I or am I not Humphrey Bogart?
- You're upsetting her, Manny.</i>

438
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,096
- Shut up, please, Kelly.
- She doesn't sleep at night.

439
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:33,644
There's no time. She has to go on.

440
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:47,380
I'm not funny because
I can't take myself seriously anymore.

441
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,288
<i>I'm just so struck by...</i>

442
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,389
the cruelty in this damn play.

443
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,935
<i>Miss Gordon?</i>

444
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,970
You're on.

445
00:39:04,873 --> 00:39:08,334
<i>Houselights down.
Places, please!</i>

446
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,348
<i>Curtain!</i>

447
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:39,838
Hey! There's a woman here!

448
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,401
Hey, and she ain't bad-looking either.

449
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,577
Hey, she left.

450
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,983
- Virginia! Hey.
- Tony!

451
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:52,455
- Tony! What are you doing?
- Look.

452
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,617
I'm married. Give me a break.

453
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,856
- I'm gonna have a heart attack.
- Me too.

454
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,860
- Are you kidding? You're wonderful.
- You're wonderful.

455
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:01,865
<i>Tony doesn't like me to interfere.</i>

456
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,000
Charlie, get away from the door.

457
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,736
<i>Maybe she's
a house detective from the noise.</i>

458
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:13,401
<i>I'm sorry. I'm going out there.</i>

459
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,680
<i>What happened?
- They're near the staircase.
They're talking.</i>

460
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,586
<i>- Do you think he knows her?
- Yes, it's the first wife.</i>

461
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:27,648
You've got to understand.
It's a shock for me to see you.

462
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:31,856
I'm not seeing you alone on a street corner.
I didn't bump into you in a crowd.

463
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:38,231
<i>Hello.</i>

464
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:41,966
What the hell is going on here?
Who's this dame?

465
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,134
This is Virginia.

466
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,698
Wait a minute, Virginia!

467
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,406
Wait a minute.

468
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:52,541
I expect you to say hello
to my family.

469
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

470
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,992
This is, uh -
This is my ex-wife from 15 years ago.

471
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,192
And this is my new wife.

472
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,596
Wait a minute, Virginia.

473
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:15,603
<i>- Listen, I'm really awfully sorry
tojust come in like this.
- This is my sister-in-law, Carla.</i>

474
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:18,166
- I want you to meet Charlie Spikes.
- I should've given some -

475
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:21,972
- This is Charlie Spikes.
- I got a letter from home that
said Tony was gonna be here.

476
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,980
- My daughter, Leona.
- Hi.

477
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:27,108
My wife, Lena. This is Virginia.
Say hello to Virginia.

478
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,016
- Shake hands. Come on.
- I feel I'm intruding.

479
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:33,079
You haven't met my son Vito!
Goddamn it, no!

480
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:36,383
<i>- You haven't met my son Vito.
- What's going on?</i>

481
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,394
<i>- Get away from me!
- Charlie, leave him alone. He's an ass.</i>

482
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,952
And you shut up too!

483
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,295
This is my wife.

484
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:53,867
She's a princess.

485
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:56,775
See my kids?
I got a lot of kids.

486
00:41:56,846 --> 00:42:00,478
I got three here,
and I got two back home.

487
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,486
My wife hates
the population explosion too...

488
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:06,147
but she don't mind having them,
because she has easy babies, that's right.

489
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:09,248
- Ease off, Tony.
- Get away from me!

490
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:13,252
She goes in, and 15 minutes later,
pop! They come out.

491
00:42:13,328 --> 00:42:15,322
<i>- All right, Tony.
What are you doing, Tony?
- That right?</i>

492
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,563
Lena, listen.
You don't understand what I'm saying.

493
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,569
I'm saying that because Virginia doesn't
like kids. I don't want my kids near her.

494
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:25,629
- You're out of line, Tony!
- Tony, just leave him alone!

495
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:27,872
Just leave him alone,
you bully son of a bitch!

496
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:30,468
How dare you?
Who do you think you are?

497
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:32,482
- You have no right!
- All right, I'm sorry.

498
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,643
This is Carla. I'm not afraid of you!
I'll kick you right where it hurts!

499
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:39,345
<i>- All right, I'm sorry.
- What do you want?</i>

500
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,947
What kind of woman are you?

501
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,595
<i>Lena, come here.
Come here!</i>

502
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:48,964
<i>Just sit down.</i>

503
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:57,337
<i>- Tony--
- Just sit down.</i>

504
00:42:57,406 --> 00:42:59,737
<i>Listen, you son of a bitch!
Keep away from me!</i>

505
00:42:59,807 --> 00:43:02,472
<i>Goddamn it, I'll kill ya!</i>

506
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,205
- Stop it!
- Stay the hell away from me!

507
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,543
- Will you cool it!
- Keep him away from me!

508
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:10,179
<i>- Just get him away from me!
- Can't you just stop it?</i>

509
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:14,124
<i>I mean, you're hurting your wife!
You're hurting your kids!</i>

510
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,124
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

511
00:43:17,493 --> 00:43:19,430
<i>I'm- I'm so sorry.</i>

512
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:24,467
See this?

513
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:28,698
I wore this veil because
he used to be so crazy about veils.

514
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:34,231
I'm sorry.
I'm a stupid woman, and I -

515
00:43:35,247 --> 00:43:38,702
This is very embarrassing,
and I'm just sorry.

516
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:44,052
It's just that there's such a difference
between what you dream about...

517
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,088
and what's really there, isn't there?

518
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:51,921
What's the matter?

519
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,122
What's the matter?

520
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,963
Come on, now. Stop that.
Stop being a pissant.

521
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:02,096
Go out there
and play the shit out of it.

522
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,297
Come on now.

523
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,307
You got it.

524
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,847
Go on.

525
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:14,516
<i>I'm sore at you.
I don't know why.</i>

526
00:44:16,585 --> 00:44:19,316
What are you doing,
talking to your pictures?

527
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:23,624
Where were you?
I've been home all afternoon.

528
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:25,660
I've been home
for a couple of hours.

529
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,095
Hey.

530
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:33,696
Marty, I want
to tell you something.

531
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,830
Is it the end of the world?
You want a drink?

532
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,896
No, it's not
the end of the world.

533
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,110
What is it?

534
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,839
I'm not good enough for you.

535
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,853
- You're not good enough for me?
- No.

536
00:44:51,921 --> 00:44:54,081
Well, I don't want to hear that.

537
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:59,258
I really don't want to hear that.
You're my inspiration.

538
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,853
Before I met you, I was -

539
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,664
I was a bum. I was a drunk.
I was a drunk with a pad.

540
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:10,629
I was W.C. Fields without a nose.

541
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,833
I was Dean Martin without any charm.

542
00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:15,843
I was no good, really.

543
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,570
I -

544
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:22,742
I thought that
small talk was too small.

545
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,752
I thought big talk
was too pretentious.

546
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,617
I thought music was noise...

547
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,021
and I thought art was bullshit.

548
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:32,026
That's what I thought.

549
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:36,197
I know you're no good, Virginia.

550
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:40,134
You're just a girl, two legs.
I know that.

551
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:42,533
But I love you.

552
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:46,937
You see, I'm not too secure.
I'm step by step.

553
00:45:48,677 --> 00:45:50,735
But I know you, you see.

554
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,978
I know you because I look at you
while you sleep.

555
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:58,076
Did you know that you sleep with half
your eyes open? Did you know that?

556
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,580
I went to see my first husband today.

557
00:46:02,658 --> 00:46:04,783
Oh. Well. Really?

558
00:46:07,395 --> 00:46:09,334
How was he?

559
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:12,558
Was he interesting?

560
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:15,124
Was he good-looking? Still?

561
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:17,136
Was he...

562
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,207
disappointing?

563
00:46:20,275 --> 00:46:23,244
No, I guess not.
Well, that's normal, you know.

564
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:26,143
Listen, I promised
I'd never double-cross you.

565
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:31,277
<i>I told you as long as I was here,
I'd be straight with you.</i>

566
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:39,189
I was very much in love
with you, Virginia.

567
00:46:41,495 --> 00:46:43,726
When was that?

568
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:47,099
No, come on, really.
I would like to know.

569
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,103
You don't get to me.

570
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:54,866
You want to get to me?
You don't get to me.

571
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:57,174
There's no way
for you to get to me.

572
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,514
You want to take dope? Go ahead.
You want to get drunk? Go ahead.

573
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:05,417
You want to go out with some guy,
4:00 in the afternoon?

574
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:09,390
Be with some guy? Go ahead.
That's your problem.

575
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,391
What a mess I am.
I'm begging again.

576
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,395
You want to be young
again, is that it?

577
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,393
Oh, Marty.

578
00:47:24,473 --> 00:47:26,441
All right, get up.

579
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:36,347
Sweetheart, get -
Sweetheart, did I hurt you?

580
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:51,296
Virginia, I didn't hit you that hard.

581
00:47:57,807 --> 00:47:59,739
For Christ's sakes, get up!

582
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:15,221
I'll -

583
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,137
Are you all right?
I was gonna call a doctor.

584
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,252
Don't be afraid.

585
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:50,585
I - I love you.

586
00:48:54,663 --> 00:48:56,995
You're a wonderful actor, Maurice.

587
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:04,667
We must never forget
this is only a play.

588
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:08,674
Well...

589
00:49:29,228 --> 00:49:34,064
<i>I think it's wonderful how
you told everyone Maurice is an actor.</i>

590
00:49:34,132 --> 00:49:38,298
<i>I mean, no one would have known
if you hadn't told 'em.</i>

591
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:42,302
<i>And I think it's marvelous...</i>

592
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:45,209
<i>how accurately
you described to the audience...</i>

593
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:48,112
<i>a play.</i>

594
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:50,979
<i>- Bravo.
- You're being sarcastic.</i>

595
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,148
<i>Then you understand something.</i>

596
00:49:56,222 --> 00:49:58,157
<i>- Myrtle, do you like the part?
- No!</i>

597
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:00,695
<i>- You feel she's confused?
- She's not confused, no.</i>

598
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:03,193
You feel she's happy?
You feel she's sad? What is it you feel?

599
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:06,222
<i>Manny, excuse me a minute.</i>

600
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:09,327
But does she -
does she wreck you?

601
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:13,135
<i>Does she distress you so much
you can't sleep at night?</i>

602
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:15,369
<i>David, I know you're trying to help, but--</i>

603
00:50:15,444 --> 00:50:19,777
<i>How can you represent someone
if you have no respect for her?</i>

604
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:25,014
I mean, we all know
you changed all the lines tonight.

605
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:27,246
Doesn't that tell you something?
Don't you say to yourself...

606
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:29,412
"Myrtle, maybe I'm not so smart."

607
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:32,082
"Maybe Sarah's play has something to say."

608
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:36,528
"Maybe I haven't
loved anything in my life."

609
00:50:36,597 --> 00:50:40,258
Maybe I should've gotten married.
Maybe I should've had children."

610
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,929
Did that ever occur to you?

611
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:44,666
Years ago.

612
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:47,228
I don't want any smart answers!

613
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,441
I don't know what the hell this is.

614
00:50:54,446 --> 00:50:56,779
<i>What is it?
You want to be loved on the stage?</i>

615
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:59,476
<i>- No.
- You feel this woman is sick?</i>

616
00:50:59,552 --> 00:51:01,545
<i>- No.
- You feel she's confused?</i>

617
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:04,053
<i>She's not confused.</i>

618
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:07,615
You feel she's happy? You feel she's sad?
What is it you feel about her?

619
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:10,931
Nothing.

620
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,366
<i>Listen, every word that Myrtle says...</i>

621
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,407
<i>is on paper.</i>

622
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:23,430
<i>Here we're sitting around talking
like she has to manufacture the words.</i>

623
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:32,039
You see,
there's Act I, Act II, Act III.

624
00:51:32,117 --> 00:51:34,349
All you have to do
is say the lines clearly...

625
00:51:34,421 --> 00:51:36,617
and with a degree of feeling.

626
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:42,320
And then the -
Virginia will appear.

627
00:51:45,233 --> 00:51:47,632
Oh.

628
00:51:47,701 --> 00:51:49,635
Now the goddamn tears.

629
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,898
Keep me up all night.

630
00:51:56,976 --> 00:52:00,210
I have to tell you I love you
in front of my wife.

631
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,012
Now we get your goddamn tears.

632
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:05,709
<i>Aw, come on, Manny.
That's too strong.</i>

633
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:08,118
All right.

634
00:52:08,187 --> 00:52:11,384
David, I want to talk to her.

635
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:13,426
Wait outside, will ya?

636
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:15,429
Okay.

637
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:21,464
I'm not sore at you.

638
00:52:24,503 --> 00:52:26,439
<i>Come on in.</i>

639
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,702
<i>I have a bar set up.
How about a drink?</i>

640
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:35,112
<i>- No, thanks.
- Oh, come on.</i>

641
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:37,171
<i>Loosen up a little.
Have a drink.</i>

642
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,184
No, thank you.
I don't want one.

643
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:44,292
Sit down.

644
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,847
<i>Should we call room service?</i>

645
00:52:46,925 --> 00:52:48,916
- You're not hungry?
- No, thanks.

646
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:00,005
How old are you really?

647
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:07,643
I'm trying to be patient.
How old are you, hmm?

648
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:10,409
I'm 65.

649
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:12,416
How old are you?

650
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:18,880
Well, if you can't say your age,
then you can't accept my play.

651
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:34,739
I accept my age.

652
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:39,304
- Why can't you read my lines?
- Listen, Sarah.

653
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,907
Every playwright
writes a play about herself.

654
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:45,381
You've written a play about aging.

655
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:50,082
- I'm not your age.
- What is your age?

656
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:58,286
I am aware that, uh, playing
an older woman is part of my problem.

657
00:53:58,364 --> 00:54:01,628
I have no illusions
about being a teenager.

658
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:08,131
But on stage, you have
Virginia having hot flashes.

659
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:12,767
I don't have hot flashes.
I'm not going through menopause.

660
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:16,973
I'm not ready to play grandmothers yet.
You know, you're very clever.

661
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:20,984
If I'm good at this part,
my career is severely limited.

662
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:25,720
- Limited to what?
- Once you're convincing in a part...

663
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:28,784
- the audience accepts you as that.
- As what?

664
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:32,161
As old, that's what. Old.

665
00:54:33,496 --> 00:54:36,559
- Are you gonna quit?
- No.

666
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:43,308
I'm looking for a way to play this part
where age doesn't make any difference.

667
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:46,536
Age isn't interesting.
Age is depressing. Age is dull.

668
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,942
Age doesn't have anything
to do with anything.

669
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:51,542
Listen, Sarah,
I don't have a husband.

670
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:54,950
I don't have a family.
This is it for me.

671
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:57,888
I mean, I get my kicks
out of acting.

672
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:01,119
If I can reach a woman
sitting in the audience...

673
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,421
who thinks that nobody
understands anything...

674
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:06,259
and my character goes through
everything that she's going through...

675
00:55:06,334 --> 00:55:08,322
I feel like I've done a good job.

676
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:12,198
You think that anyone who's old
can't be vulnerable?

677
00:55:13,205 --> 00:55:15,262
<i>That's not what I'm saying.</i>

678
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:18,573
Well, what are you saying?

679
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:22,272
When I was 18,
I could do anything.

680
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,375
My emotions were
so close to the surface...

681
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:28,080
I could feel everything easily.

682
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,154
But now -

683
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:34,494
This is years later-

684
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:39,791
Plays later.
Years later.

685
00:55:39,863 --> 00:55:42,661
So, what's the answer?

686
00:55:42,736 --> 00:55:44,792
I have this dead girl.

687
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:51,836
You know. You remember that kid
that was in the accident.

688
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:54,572
She's, uh -

689
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:57,707
She's so open. She's -

690
00:55:57,784 --> 00:55:59,716
She's really-

691
00:56:02,055 --> 00:56:05,148
She's really just on top
of everything emotionally.

692
00:56:05,224 --> 00:56:07,157
She's -

693
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:10,426
She reminds me -

694
00:56:18,036 --> 00:56:20,869
You said you have this dead girl.

695
00:56:20,938 --> 00:56:23,065
What does "have" mean?

696
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:28,076
Is she here now?
In this room?

697
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,789
Good night, Sarah.

698
00:56:47,297 --> 00:56:49,824
David?

699
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,166
- I've been waiting for you.
- Oh, I've been with Sarah.

700
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,537
I thought I'd buy you a drink.

701
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:02,769
I'm so tired, David.

702
00:57:18,197 --> 00:57:20,561
Hello?

703
00:57:34,647 --> 00:57:37,239
Hello?

704
00:57:37,314 --> 00:57:41,082
No, I -
I can't see you now.

705
00:57:42,856 --> 00:57:46,188
<i>I don't want to see you.
I'm with someone.</i>

706
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:05,207
I'm very concerned.

707
00:58:22,826 --> 00:58:25,696
Well, as long as somebody's
going to be with you...

708
00:58:25,765 --> 00:58:27,696
I'll say good night.

709
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,574
- Good night.
- Good night, David.

710
00:58:43,715 --> 00:58:46,047
Myrtle, for Christ's sake!

711
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,217
- What the hell are you trying to prove?
- Give me.

712
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:59,456
What are you trying to prove?
You're acting like some grade school
theatrical kid, for Christ's sake!

713
00:59:01,632 --> 00:59:03,963
Everybody loves you.

714
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:06,663
- You're a super, high-priced professional.
- I'm what?

715
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:08,570
- Now, calm down.
- Huh? I'm what?

716
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,801
- Calm down, will you?
- What am I?

717
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:16,742
I don't know what the hell it is.

718
00:59:16,814 --> 00:59:19,577
<i>What is she?
Apolitical fantasy?</i>

719
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:23,610
<i>A - A frustrated vision
of Sarah's own inability?</i>

720
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:26,681
I don't know anything about this play.
I don't know anything about this woman.

721
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:31,521
I told my wife tonight. I said, "Dorothy,
I don't know what this play is about."

722
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:34,087
- I don't know what this woman is about.
- Manny, Manny.

723
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:38,930
She's not even like some bum.
You know? She's not even a bum.

724
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:42,268
She's not a bitch.
She's nothing.

725
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,838
She's nothing.

726
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:48,069
I mean, if I play her the way
everybody wants me to play her...

727
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:51,411
like some little over-the-hill matron...

728
00:59:51,483 --> 00:59:53,642
my career is over.

729
00:59:53,717 --> 00:59:55,846
I'm sick to death of hearing
how old this woman is.

730
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,409
Who gives a damn
how old this woman is?

731
00:59:58,486 --> 01:00:02,048
- Does she win, or does she lose?
That's what I want to know.
- I know.

732
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,059
- Is that such a lousy question?
- I know, I know.

733
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:08,565
I'm beginning to feel guilty
for asking, for God's sakes.

734
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,342
I like the music.

735
01:00:56,112 --> 01:01:00,414
It's a nice, soothing sound.

736
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:02,951
I used to play it on my stereo.

737
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,555
I was always alone.

738
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:10,851
Waiting for time to pass.

739
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,794
Waiting for night to come.

740
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,025
The movies don't start till 6:00.

741
01:01:19,602 --> 01:01:22,435
I'd dream with the music...

742
01:01:22,506 --> 01:01:24,438
until dinner.

743
01:01:25,776 --> 01:01:28,265
Go to a movie...

744
01:01:28,343 --> 01:01:30,277
or a concert.

745
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:34,451
Boys.

746
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:38,244
And men...

747
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,256
older men.

748
01:01:42,223 --> 01:01:44,160
And boys...

749
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:49,094
always picked me up.

750
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,998
I don't want to hear
about your sex life.

751
01:02:06,147 --> 01:02:07,911
What the hell are you doing?

752
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:11,577
<i>- If I could rid myself of you--
- Are you going over your lines?</i>

753
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,150
If only I didn't have to think about
what's gonna happen to you.

754
01:02:22,998 --> 01:02:25,434
If I could rid myself of
the thought of being your wife.

755
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:27,990
Oh, my God.

756
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:32,098
I know you're frightened that I'm going
to go too far in the wrong direction.

757
01:02:34,277 --> 01:02:38,441
- You're afraid I'm going to make
a fool of myself, aren't you?
- No.

758
01:02:38,515 --> 01:02:41,848
<i>You're afraid that
somehow my behavior...</i>

759
01:02:41,918 --> 01:02:44,080
- is going to undermine you.
- Don't, Myrtle.

760
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:56,323
- Here we go. Come on, Myrtle.
- Please, one autograph!

761
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,891
All right, people.

762
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:01,663
Miss Gordon's late.
Would you let us through, please?

763
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:04,697
Would you let us through, please?

764
01:03:04,774 --> 01:03:09,337
She'll sign all your autographs
after the performance.

765
01:03:09,413 --> 01:03:12,210
<i>- Could you just sign one?
- We're late, darling.</i>

766
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,748
Now, be sweet, sweetheart.

767
01:03:14,817 --> 01:03:19,115
Let us through, huh? Would you
please let us through, darling?

768
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:20,848
- Miss Gordon, please.
- I promise you -

769
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,949
- I've waited so long to see you.
- If you're patient...

770
01:03:23,025 --> 01:03:26,984
right after the performance, Miss Gordon
will sign all your autographs.

771
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:30,122
- Let us through now. Let us through.
- Thank you.

772
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:35,330
<i>One more.
- Right after the show, she'll sign
all your autographs, really. That's right.</i>

773
01:03:36,671 --> 01:03:40,269
Believe me, believe me. Right after
the show, she'll sign every one.

774
01:03:40,343 --> 01:03:43,404
<i>We're late.</i>

775
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:48,640
<i>Oh, my God, it's--</i>

776
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,950
Be careful, Manny.

777
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:44,929
Kelly, you've gotta talk toJimmy for me
about the props in the second act.

778
01:04:45,003 --> 01:04:49,170
That cigarette lighter has to work.
And tell him to leave some matches
on the bar in case.

779
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:04,826
I'm going.

780
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:09,494
I'll be at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

781
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:16,469
The number is Crestview 6-2251.

782
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:21,068
If you need me,
that's where I'll be.

783
01:05:25,147 --> 01:05:28,807
If you change your mind,
you call me.

784
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,339
No smoking, Mr. Victor.

785
01:06:22,804 --> 01:06:25,240
Hello?

786
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:27,796
Hello, Sophie.

787
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:30,468
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I didn't - didn't mean to hold you up.

788
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:32,912
I just forgot to get back.

789
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:37,040
Listen, I'm kind of busy right now.
Can I call you back?

790
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:39,051
Okay.

791
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,845
<i>Can I have a match, please?</i>

792
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:11,711
<i>What the hell is she up to now?</i>

793
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,792
Can I have a match, please?

794
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:23,421
<i>Thanks, Frankie.</i>

795
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:39,778
<i>I think she's all right.</i>

796
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:48,619
<i>Shh! Never mind now.</i>

797
01:07:58,232 --> 01:08:01,394
- Hello?
- I'm gonna kill thatJimmy.

798
01:08:01,467 --> 01:08:05,460
<i>No, Esther isn't here either.
Call back, will you?</i>

799
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:38,036
- Hello.
- Hello.

800
01:08:41,978 --> 01:08:45,308
<i>I couldn't find the place.
It took me two hours to get here.</i>

801
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:55,084
I'm sorry I was so crude to you today.

802
01:08:57,324 --> 01:08:59,260
You shocked me.

803
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,527
I'd have never expected
to see you again.

804
01:09:02,593 --> 01:09:06,361
<i>I've thought about you.</i>

805
01:09:08,135 --> 01:09:10,295
I, uh...

806
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:13,634
expected you to be
a great big fat dame by now.

807
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:30,249
This is just like it was
on our wedding night, you know?

808
01:09:32,257 --> 01:09:35,523
<i>Why is she making an exit?
- It's the same way it was
for me that night.</i>

809
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:40,358
<i>I mean, I, uh--</i>

810
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:42,367
<i>I felt the same way that night.</i>

811
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:59,516
Are you all right up there?

812
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:02,453
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

813
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,852
<i>You haven't got
a back door, or some way...</i>

814
01:10:04,924 --> 01:10:07,556
<i>you're gonna get out, are you?</i>

815
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:13,730
<i>These, uh--</i>

816
01:10:13,801 --> 01:10:16,635
<i>These big living rooms
always turn me on.</i>

817
01:10:27,513 --> 01:10:32,246
<i>- Is everything all right, Miss Gordon?
- Sure.</i>

818
01:10:32,318 --> 01:10:37,381
<i>I think you better get out there.
Gus is on stage alone.</i>

819
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:40,721
<i>You all right up there?</i>

820
01:10:53,605 --> 01:10:56,538
Get the curtain down.
I said bring the curtain down!

821
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,976
<i>- Which one is it?
- It's up there, Mr., uh...</i>

822
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,382
Victor. Thank you.

823
01:11:11,455 --> 01:11:14,858
How come you got your shirt off?
Hey! Hey! Hey!

824
01:11:14,928 --> 01:11:18,864
Wait! Get that damn curtain up
right this minute! Get it up!

825
01:11:18,932 --> 01:11:22,957
<i>Get that curtain up right now!
No argument! Get it up!</i>

826
01:11:23,035 --> 01:11:25,698
<i>Up! Up!</i>

827
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:27,705
Up!

828
01:11:37,849 --> 01:11:40,148
Humiliating!

829
01:11:41,988 --> 01:11:43,923
<i>Okay.</i>

830
01:11:52,263 --> 01:11:54,527
<i>I've changed, haven't I?</i>

831
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:56,762
<i>You have.</i>

832
01:11:56,835 --> 01:12:00,293
- I've aged, haven't I?
- No.

833
01:12:01,305 --> 01:12:05,801
Oh, you can't say that I'm still the same
baby I was when you first knew me.

834
01:12:05,877 --> 01:12:09,076
Not the same skin,
not the same eyes.

835
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:14,878
Do you know how old I am?

836
01:12:14,954 --> 01:12:16,946
I don't want to know.
You look terrific.

837
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:19,387
Oh, but I feel so different.

838
01:12:24,898 --> 01:12:26,832
Okay, let's go.

839
01:12:31,404 --> 01:12:33,928
Time is a killer, isn't it, folks?

840
01:12:36,908 --> 01:12:41,244
All those lonely nights.
You know about lonely nights?

841
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:44,180
You bet you do.

842
01:12:45,184 --> 01:12:47,174
How about those lonely days?

843
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,947
How about them, hmm?

844
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:53,957
How you doing?

845
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,961
How about you?
You know about those lonely nights?

846
01:13:04,036 --> 01:13:07,234
- I know what you mean.
- You do?

847
01:13:07,507 --> 01:13:09,237
I really enjoyed it.

848
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:13,436
- Wonderful.
- Very, very funny.

849
01:13:26,058 --> 01:13:27,991
Someone said you're
the producer. Are you?

850
01:13:28,059 --> 01:13:30,583
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, it was good.

851
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:32,595
Oh, thanks.
That's very nice.

852
01:13:32,663 --> 01:13:36,394
I like the leading parts,
but there were too many old-age parts.

853
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:38,402
- Old-age?
- Yeah.

854
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:40,700
- She's always good.
- Oh, she's marvelous.

855
01:13:40,772 --> 01:13:42,867
Henry liked it.
Henry!

856
01:13:42,943 --> 01:13:44,873
Come here, tell him.
He's the producer.

857
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,241
<i>- It's a very serious play.
- That means you didn't like it.</i>

858
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:51,874
What was wrong tonight?
The play seemed so mixed up.

859
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,973
<i>- Really?
- Excuse me.</i>

860
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:56,385
Mr. Samuels,
I talked to five people.

861
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:58,514
- Yeah?
- Three of them thought it was "yecch."

862
01:13:58,589 --> 01:14:01,854
Two of them hated it. The other one
didn't know what was going on at all.

863
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:08,628
- It's a disaster, a disaster.
- It's not a disaster.

864
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:12,431
Listen, I want you to get Zeitz up here
first thing in the morning. The first thing!

865
01:14:13,771 --> 01:14:17,070
Get out of my way.
Don't stand there. Go do what you're told.

866
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:19,302
I can open the door.
Beat it.

867
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,008
<i>Okay, so I got
a few laughs tonight.</i>

868
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,414
<i>Listen, I've seen worse nights
than that, babies.</i>

869
01:14:26,484 --> 01:14:29,249
<i>I've seen-seen drunks
in the audience...</i>

870
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,015
<i>heart attacks, lines screwed up...</i>

871
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:35,754
<i>nerves, dope,
theaters burning.</i>

872
01:14:35,829 --> 01:14:38,592
<i>- What are we talking about here?
- All right, Myrtle, listen to me.</i>

873
01:14:38,663 --> 01:14:40,597
Half the audience loved the play.

874
01:14:40,665 --> 01:14:42,361
The other half hated it.

875
01:14:42,433 --> 01:14:46,426
- But you're still my favorite star.
- That's not what I was talking about.
You know that!

876
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:48,598
<i>What are they, blind?</i>

877
01:14:48,672 --> 01:14:50,664
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

878
01:14:50,742 --> 01:14:52,674
<i>Look, it's Myrtle's problem.</i>

879
01:14:52,741 --> 01:14:55,074
It's up to you, Myrtle,
if you wanna straighten yourself out.

880
01:14:55,146 --> 01:14:57,273
<i>She's the only one that can solve it.</i>

881
01:14:57,347 --> 01:15:00,681
Listen, you liar, you just shut up
and don't talk to me anymore.

882
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:03,483
<i>- Hey, I'm on the stage with you.
- What do you think is going wrong?</i>

883
01:15:03,556 --> 01:15:05,921
<i>- Nothing.
- She doesn't think anything's going wrong.</i>

884
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:12,423
- Is it the girl that was killed?
- What girl?
- No.

885
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:14,690
<i>- The autograph hound.
- The girl that was killed?</i>

886
01:15:14,765 --> 01:15:17,098
Have you, uh -

887
01:15:17,168 --> 01:15:20,626
<i>- Have you seen her since she died?
- Oh, Sarah, please.</i>

888
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:23,502
- No.
- Uh, now -

889
01:15:23,573 --> 01:15:25,838
Sarah, I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

890
01:15:25,909 --> 01:15:29,175
The problem is here with us.
Let's not complicate it with never never land.

891
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:32,445
<i>Look, the name of this play
is The Second Woman.</i>

892
01:15:32,518 --> 01:15:36,317
The girl dies,
and Myrtle can't cope with it.

893
01:15:36,387 --> 01:15:39,184
<i>Who is this girl?</i>

894
01:15:39,256 --> 01:15:41,052
Did you see her?

895
01:15:43,026 --> 01:15:47,155
<i>All right. Okay, I have seen her,
but not like you think.</i>

896
01:15:47,231 --> 01:15:49,666
I mean, I made her up.

897
01:15:49,734 --> 01:15:51,793
She's mine. She's my fantasy.

898
01:15:51,868 --> 01:15:55,496
I wanted to see
how it would feel like to be, uh -

899
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:57,631
To be young again.

900
01:15:57,707 --> 01:16:00,678
Whatever.
If that makes you happy.

901
01:16:00,746 --> 01:16:03,111
Was she on the stage
with you again tonight?

902
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:04,740
<i>No!</i>

903
01:16:04,817 --> 01:16:09,376
<i>Look, would I let anybody
go on stage for me? Are you crazy?</i>

904
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,682
<i>- Do you know what's going on?
- No.</i>

905
01:16:13,758 --> 01:16:16,488
Can I take Myrtle
to my spiritualist?

906
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:18,495
<i>- Oh! Wait a minute.
- Spiritualist?</i>

907
01:16:18,563 --> 01:16:21,497
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

908
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:24,693
Myrtle, you were never in it tonight,
not for a moment.

909
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:27,794
Now, I don't know whether it's because
you don't want to, because you can't...

910
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:30,034
because you're nuts,
I don't know.

911
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:34,206
Or because, uh,
the play's about aging and, uh...

912
01:16:34,278 --> 01:16:36,210
<i>you're repulsed by it.</i>

913
01:16:36,278 --> 01:16:38,212
<i>I don't know.</i>

914
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,773
<i>But I think it's an important play.</i>

915
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,582
And, uh, if you don't
put yourself out -

916
01:16:45,655 --> 01:16:50,094
I mean, if you don't feel the pain
of the losing of, uh...

917
01:16:51,362 --> 01:16:53,125
passion and, uh -

918
01:16:57,568 --> 01:17:02,940
<i>Look, if I put a call in to New York,
we'll be there in less than two hours.</i>

919
01:17:03,007 --> 01:17:06,910
I'll take her to my spiritualist, and we'll
be back in time for rehearsal tomorrow.

920
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,879
<i>I don't want anybody
to misunderstand this lunacy.</i>

921
01:17:09,946 --> 01:17:12,380
It's made up.
I can control it.

922
01:17:12,448 --> 01:17:15,444
<i>It's- It's- I- I just let
my imagination go a little bit.</i>

923
01:17:15,522 --> 01:17:17,612
<i>Are you sure
it's just your imagination?</i>

924
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,714
<i>I can make her appear
or disappear at will!</i>

925
01:17:54,894 --> 01:17:56,882
Please come and sit down.

926
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,864
Hello, Sarah.
How are you?

927
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:10,461
- Oh, and you must be Miss Gordon.
- Yes. How are you?

928
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,666
- Fine. Please sit down.
- Thank you.

929
01:18:13,743 --> 01:18:15,232
Sarah.

930
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:18,938
- Is it okay if I join the sance?
- Please do.

931
01:18:19,014 --> 01:18:20,677
Thanks.

932
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,713
Doris, get the candles.

933
01:18:27,822 --> 01:18:30,757
Can't see in the pitch black,
you know.

934
01:18:30,827 --> 01:18:32,489
And bring Frank in.

935
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:39,098
We need a fan. When we close the doors,
it gets stuffy in here, you know.

936
01:18:40,672 --> 01:18:42,332
Now, Sarah...

937
01:18:42,406 --> 01:18:44,531
from what you've told me
on the phone...

938
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:47,370
<i>this could be
a misplaced phenomenon...</i>

939
01:18:47,445 --> 01:18:49,969
Iooking for a way to cause trouble.

940
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:53,882
Well, I believe that Nancy exists...

941
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:57,009
but, uh, only in my mind.

942
01:18:57,088 --> 01:18:58,852
I'm an actress...

943
01:18:58,923 --> 01:19:02,253
and the play
that we're doing right now...

944
01:19:02,323 --> 01:19:05,260
is about the gradual lessening...

945
01:19:05,328 --> 01:19:07,888
of my power as a woman...

946
01:19:07,964 --> 01:19:10,760
as I... mature.

947
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:13,963
Uh...

948
01:19:14,037 --> 01:19:16,938
at some time in life youth dies...

949
01:19:17,006 --> 01:19:20,307
and the second woman in us
takes over.

950
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:25,371
I believe that Nancy is
the first woman in my own life.

951
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:28,074
Nancy. The girl who got killed?

952
01:19:28,151 --> 01:19:30,744
- Yes.
- I see.

953
01:19:31,988 --> 01:19:34,718
Actresses create characters.

954
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:38,589
I created Nancy
because I thought there were...

955
01:19:38,659 --> 01:19:42,654
certain scenes in the play
where I was having trouble...

956
01:19:42,731 --> 01:19:45,667
uh, visualizing my own life.

957
01:19:45,735 --> 01:19:48,669
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

958
01:19:48,737 --> 01:19:50,673
<i>I drink, I--</i>

959
01:19:50,741 --> 01:19:52,968
<i>I stay up all night, I--</i>

960
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:55,305
<i>You're so right.</i>

961
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:57,310
<i>I'll dojust about anything...</i>

962
01:19:57,379 --> 01:19:59,869
to make my character
more authentic.

963
01:19:59,948 --> 01:20:01,940
I always have.

964
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:04,948
I see.

965
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:08,216
Well...

966
01:20:09,593 --> 01:20:13,756
let's turn up our hands, everyone,
and put them flat on the table.

967
01:20:18,202 --> 01:20:21,865
I'd like to see your palms,
um, darling.

968
01:20:24,641 --> 01:20:29,405
<i>Doris, get a pan of water
and a wash rag, please.</i>

969
01:20:37,852 --> 01:20:40,617
<i>Your hands were smudged.</i>

970
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:42,782
Must have brushed against you.

971
01:20:52,632 --> 01:20:57,264
<i>This, uh, Nancy of yours,
Myrtle, is a bad girl.</i>

972
01:20:57,338 --> 01:20:59,740
She's very tough.

973
01:21:01,642 --> 01:21:04,546
<i>I feel she's very near to us now.</i>

974
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:13,553
<i>Well, what do you want me to do?</i>

975
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,385
<i>Lower the lights, and, Frank,
light the candles, please.</i>

976
01:21:32,808 --> 01:21:35,071
I'm sorry. I - It's, uh -

977
01:21:36,743 --> 01:21:39,908
You want to protect this kid, honey?

978
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:42,849
I-I just don't know
how to explain it.

979
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,752
It's, uh - It's like
when you were a child...

980
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:47,584
and you had an imaginary friend.

981
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:50,488
You know, someone that you made up?
She doesn't exist.

982
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,891
Well, at least now you know.

983
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,454
<i>At least I know what?</i>

984
01:21:56,532 --> 01:21:59,830
A lot of people think
the young girl in us is important.

985
01:22:00,835 --> 01:22:03,395
<i>Not too many years ago...</i>

986
01:22:03,471 --> 01:22:06,772
<i>I went around
pretending I was 18.</i>

987
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:08,537
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

988
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:10,542
<i>I was 60.</i>

989
01:22:14,116 --> 01:22:15,949
Take a snooze, huh?

990
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:27,493
Night.

991
01:22:32,236 --> 01:22:35,827
Well, uh, listen, thank you.
You know? That was -

992
01:22:35,902 --> 01:22:38,462
Oh, that's all right.
Get some sleep, will ya.

993
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:40,909
- Go on. Sleep.
- You too.

994
01:24:10,196 --> 01:24:12,132
Where are you?

995
01:24:19,373 --> 01:24:21,308
You know it's not your fault.

996
01:24:22,677 --> 01:24:24,612
You're only 18.

997
01:24:27,446 --> 01:24:29,975
It's not my fault either.

998
01:24:30,052 --> 01:24:31,986
I'm an actress.

999
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:35,686
I have to...

1000
01:24:35,756 --> 01:24:38,487
I -

1001
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,049
Ohh!

1002
01:25:14,763 --> 01:25:16,696
<i>Hello!</i>

1003
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,329
Hello.

1004
01:25:27,907 --> 01:25:30,639
- Listen, you know who I am, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

1005
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:34,340
Well, the door to Miss Goode's suite
is locked.

1006
01:25:34,413 --> 01:25:37,975
- Mm-hmm?
- Well, I'm locked out.

1007
01:25:38,985 --> 01:25:42,113
Oh. You're from
up in the penthouse, aren't you?

1008
01:25:42,187 --> 01:25:44,157
I - I need to get in.

1009
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:46,853
- Have you got the key?
- I have some keys.

1010
01:25:46,927 --> 01:25:49,623
I don't know if I have the key
to Miss Goode's room.

1011
01:25:49,698 --> 01:25:52,959
Would you try one, please?
I'm sure you can get me in.

1012
01:25:53,031 --> 01:25:55,159
I haven't seen you
in the movies in a while.

1013
01:25:55,235 --> 01:25:58,672
- I'm doing a play.
- Oh, I heard that.

1014
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:00,467
Let's see if this one works.

1015
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:03,838
No, that doesn't.

1016
01:26:05,513 --> 01:26:07,448
Let's try this one.

1017
01:26:21,128 --> 01:26:23,619
- Thank you.
- That's too much.

1018
01:26:23,697 --> 01:26:25,561
That's really too much.

1019
01:26:25,632 --> 01:26:27,827
You're just great.
Thank you.

1020
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:23,683
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1021
01:27:26,525 --> 01:27:28,462
Don't worry, Sarah.

1022
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:32,189
I'm doing this to myself.

1023
01:27:37,236 --> 01:27:39,729
I'm a little shook.

1024
01:27:41,809 --> 01:27:43,742
Use your bathroom?

1025
01:28:25,353 --> 01:28:27,341
I'm a little shook up.

1026
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:32,789
Be all right with you
if I spent the night?

1027
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:50,669
- Were you with her last night?
- Yes.

1028
01:28:50,743 --> 01:28:52,404
<i>Manny, she's crazy.</i>

1029
01:28:52,477 --> 01:28:55,413
- Sarah, we've been waiting for two hours.
- I've never seen behavior like this.

1030
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:58,574
- Two precious hours of rehearsal.
- She's got to be replaced.

1031
01:28:58,652 --> 01:29:01,584
Oh, you want me to replace her now?
One day before New York?

1032
01:29:01,654 --> 01:29:03,642
Thank you very much.

1033
01:29:06,393 --> 01:29:08,325
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

1034
01:29:09,394 --> 01:29:13,092
- Leo, tell everyone to take a break.
We'll be back in a half hour.
- Right.

1035
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,774
<i>I had an affair a couple of years ago.
You know about it.</i>

1036
01:29:24,843 --> 01:29:26,969
<i>Nineteen-year-old girl.</i>

1037
01:29:29,548 --> 01:29:31,881
<i>You don't think I was
making a fool of myself?</i>

1038
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,545
<i>Think every time
I took my shirt off I didn't...</i>

1039
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:40,525
<i>wanna be younger?</i>

1040
01:29:40,593 --> 01:29:44,289
<i>I had my nails done,
my face massaged.</i>

1041
01:29:44,362 --> 01:29:47,800
<i>Had a container ofbreath spray
in my pocket at all times.</i>

1042
01:29:51,268 --> 01:29:54,034
I left my wife,
I left my children...

1043
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,309
and I had to suffer the humiliation
of going back...

1044
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:03,681
after a scene with the kid where she
very politely told me I was too old for her.

1045
01:30:03,751 --> 01:30:05,684
I made her uncomfortable.

1046
01:30:07,221 --> 01:30:09,153
But I understood that.

1047
01:30:10,722 --> 01:30:13,248
All the work I'd ever done...

1048
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,124
she went to bed with,
very passionately.

1049
01:30:18,262 --> 01:30:20,731
That's why I thought
you'd like the play.

1050
01:30:21,832 --> 01:30:23,859
It has so much of you in it.

1051
01:30:28,871 --> 01:30:31,001
You mean I shouldn't...

1052
01:30:31,078 --> 01:30:32,908
fool myself anymore...

1053
01:30:32,978 --> 01:30:34,878
to keep holding on.

1054
01:30:34,946 --> 01:30:36,937
<i>No.</i>

1055
01:30:38,216 --> 01:30:40,879
<i>Then what?
What do you mean, Manny?</i>

1056
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:45,916
What I'm trying to say
is that you're a...

1057
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:51,388
delicate, experienced...

1058
01:30:51,463 --> 01:30:53,225
exciting woman...

1059
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:57,432
who I find attractive
beyond comprehension...

1060
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:03,636
<i>a woman who amazes me
with her lack ofbelief in herself.</i>

1061
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,709
Manny...

1062
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,509
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- I'm in trouble.</i>

1063
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:12,517
I'm not acting.

1064
01:31:13,953 --> 01:31:18,788
You know the last day before New York
I'm always nervous.

1065
01:31:18,857 --> 01:31:21,484
But I always win.
I-I-I'm a strong person.

1066
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:23,494
I'm not some -

1067
01:31:24,495 --> 01:31:27,159
But this... age thing...

1068
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:29,393
it just has me
coming off the wall!

1069
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:33,603
<i>- What's the line, Leo?
- "Vito, go in the John."</i>

1070
01:31:33,672 --> 01:31:36,574
Come on, boys, pick up your cues.
This scene has to bounce. It has to pop!

1071
01:31:36,641 --> 01:31:38,576
<i>- What do you think I'm here for?
- What need is that?</i>

1072
01:31:38,642 --> 01:31:41,111
<i>She needs loving.
Every woman needs that.</i>

1073
01:31:41,179 --> 01:31:44,113
<i>- Manny, what is this scene about?
- Good scene! It's about you!</i>

1074
01:31:44,181 --> 01:31:47,150
<i>You lock your kid
in the bathroom! Is that it?</i>

1075
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:49,154
<i>- Let's take a break.
- Sarah!</i>

1076
01:31:49,221 --> 01:31:51,711
<i>No, I wanna see the fight
by the numbers.</i>

1077
01:31:51,788 --> 01:31:54,722
- You've gotta help me. You've got - Sarah.
- No. Let go of me.

1078
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:56,920
Stop it.
I'm not going anywhere -

1079
01:31:56,995 --> 01:31:58,825
<i>- Sarah! Come on!
- No, I don't want to!</i>

1080
01:31:58,896 --> 01:32:01,023
- Quiet!
- Come on!

1081
01:32:01,097 --> 01:32:04,365
<i>Oh, shut up, David!</i>

1082
01:32:04,437 --> 01:32:09,598
<i>Hey! Leave me alone!
- Where are the Bobbsey Twins going?
I don't want another disappearing act.</i>

1083
01:32:09,672 --> 01:32:11,608
I'm out of control.

1084
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:14,375
- You mustn't be out of control.
- You've gotta get me somebody else.

1085
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:17,811
- Somebody else. Not that first dame.
That first dame did something crazy!
- What did she do?

1086
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:20,717
- I don't know. It was like -
- Myrtle. Myrtle.

1087
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:25,221
<i>- We'll get a car. We'll find somebody.
- Don't you understand Manny is concerned?</i>

1088
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:28,690
<i>- With all this trouble, we wanna
be sure everything is all right.
- I don't care about Manny!</i>

1089
01:32:28,759 --> 01:32:31,389
<i>Everything is not all right.
Don't you understand?</i>

1090
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,124
I don't like the way
that son of a bitch is treating me!

1091
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:38,100
He treats me like I'm some over-the-hill
matron. I don't like being spied on either!

1092
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:41,161
I can't go to the bathroom around here
without somebody thinking
I'm having a breakdown!

1093
01:32:41,241 --> 01:32:43,797
A-Are you all right?

1094
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:47,639
Am I all right?
Am I all right?

1095
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:50,577
- David, please let me talk to her alone.
- Sarah -

1096
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:52,913
- Please. Please.
- All right, go ahead.

1097
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:58,181
Let's get out of here. Don't tell me
you don't know what I'm talking about.

1098
01:32:58,256 --> 01:33:00,916
You got me into this.
You're gonna get me out of it.

1099
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,924
- Well, you can do it.
- You understand me?

1100
01:33:02,992 --> 01:33:05,929
What do you want me to do with your clothes?
Go to the hotel and pack?

1101
01:33:05,998 --> 01:33:08,330
- I don't care!
- Yes, would you, Kelly, please?

1102
01:33:08,401 --> 01:33:10,926
- After rehearsal I'll take her into town.
- Okay, sweetie.

1103
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:14,597
You're going to call somebody, right?

1104
01:33:16,773 --> 01:33:19,799
- Six dollars, lady. How long you gonna be?
- Five minutes.

1105
01:33:19,876 --> 01:33:24,472
All right. Hey, Mack! Get going.
Thank you. Come on, get going.

1106
01:33:24,549 --> 01:33:26,984
Are you sure
you don't want me to stay with you?

1107
01:33:27,053 --> 01:33:29,316
No.

1108
01:33:29,386 --> 01:33:31,515
You just introduce me to her.

1109
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:33,524
That's all I want.

1110
01:33:42,132 --> 01:33:44,693
Miss Gordon, you are looking
completely charming today.

1111
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:46,860
- Thank you.
- Can I get something for you? Ah!

1112
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:49,566
Hurry.

1113
01:33:52,744 --> 01:33:55,008
Nice to see you again,
Miss Gordon.

1114
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,015
Thank you.

1115
01:34:10,694 --> 01:34:12,957
That little bitch!

1116
01:34:13,029 --> 01:34:15,327
Oh, there you are!

1117
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,529
Now... Mmm, don't be worried. Promise?

1118
01:34:19,602 --> 01:34:22,596
And don't be nervous.
I'll call you. Okay?

1119
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:27,000
Good-bye, Sarah.
I'll call you.

1120
01:34:32,652 --> 01:34:34,744
Maurice.

1121
01:34:35,852 --> 01:34:38,013
Can I take your order now,
Miss Gordon?

1122
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:41,183
- Uh, nothing for me.
- Miss Drake?

1123
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:43,952
Could we -
Could we do this thing now?

1124
01:34:44,028 --> 01:34:46,690
Oh, I think we'd better
go to my room.

1125
01:34:46,765 --> 01:34:49,527
Grand Marnier?
A little apricot brandy?

1126
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,534
<i>Nothing. Nothing at all.
Thank you.</i>

1127
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:53,330
Thank you.

1128
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:55,869
Sit in that comfortable chair.

1129
01:34:56,876 --> 01:34:59,036
I like this old one.
It creaks.

1130
01:35:02,514 --> 01:35:04,447
Now -

1131
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:10,077
Now, uh...

1132
01:35:10,155 --> 01:35:12,086
Nancy is her name?

1133
01:35:19,064 --> 01:35:20,724
There you are.

1134
01:35:33,877 --> 01:35:36,275
- Oh.
- You are something!

1135
01:35:38,148 --> 01:35:41,343
<i>- What does that mean?
- It means I'm no fucking spirit!</i>

1136
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,746
<i>- What does that mean?
- I have never bothered you.</i>

1137
01:35:46,824 --> 01:35:49,156
You want to kill me.

1138
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:51,922
I devoted my life to you...

1139
01:35:51,994 --> 01:35:54,987
to movies, to music...

1140
01:35:55,064 --> 01:35:57,362
the theater.

1141
01:35:57,434 --> 01:35:59,368
I'm 17 years old.

1142
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:02,969
I like sex.

1143
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,942
I like to turn people on.

1144
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:09,134
And that's what the theater is -
it's sex.

1145
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:11,178
It's like getting laid.

1146
01:36:11,246 --> 01:36:14,241
Um, what did you do to her?

1147
01:36:26,929 --> 01:36:29,626
I'm not afraid of you.

1148
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:31,668
You're an older woman.

1149
01:36:32,668 --> 01:36:36,070
You're frightened,
and you're a coward.

1150
01:36:39,978 --> 01:36:41,966
Listen, I have a -

1151
01:36:43,378 --> 01:36:45,870
I have this play.
You know that.

1152
01:36:47,251 --> 01:36:49,240
I have to do it.

1153
01:36:50,486 --> 01:36:52,385
If you hurt me...

1154
01:36:52,456 --> 01:36:54,444
I won't be able to act.

1155
01:36:54,522 --> 01:36:56,757
Make friends.

1156
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:01,590
<i>Really, I'm sorry.</i>

1157
01:37:03,265 --> 01:37:06,429
- No, don't do this.
- Stand still!

1158
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:11,568
I just wanna shake your hand.

1159
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:13,302
Don't - Don't do this.

1160
01:37:13,376 --> 01:37:15,402
- Don't you wanna touch me?
- No -

1161
01:37:59,154 --> 01:38:01,088
Miss Gordon.

1162
01:38:01,156 --> 01:38:03,091
Is she dead?

1163
01:38:10,832 --> 01:38:12,995
Is she dead?

1164
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:17,830
Listen, Miss Gordon, why don't you sit
in the lobby here and have a drink?

1165
01:38:17,906 --> 01:38:19,838
- No.
- I'll get you a nice glass of wine.

1166
01:38:19,907 --> 01:38:21,842
- No, thank you. Good-bye.
- You sure?

1167
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:24,971
<i>- Do you want me to call someone?
- No. Thank you. Thank you both.</i>

1168
01:38:36,225 --> 01:38:39,663
Uh, excu - Could I - Could I have a -
Do you have a light?

1169
01:39:05,086 --> 01:39:07,180
- Yes, miss?
- Hello, Wally.

1170
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:10,282
You don't remember me.

1171
01:39:10,357 --> 01:39:13,625
Miss Gordon, by God!

1172
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:18,959
<i>It's so good to see you back. I didn't know
who you were, looking like a frump.</i>

1173
01:39:19,035 --> 01:39:21,400
<i>Well, welcome back.</i>

1174
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:23,802
Is he, uh -
Is he upstairs, Wally?

1175
01:39:23,872 --> 01:39:27,002
Yeah, it's been about,
oh, half an hour or so.

1176
01:39:27,076 --> 01:39:28,736
Is he by himself?

1177
01:39:33,081 --> 01:39:36,074
<i>- You know, I really missed you.
- I missed you too.</i>

1178
01:40:10,919 --> 01:40:14,150
<i>Open up, you son of a bitch.</i>

1179
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:25,221
Hello. How are you?

1180
01:40:25,299 --> 01:40:28,063
<i>- Fine. How are you?
- Fine. How are you?</i>

1181
01:40:28,134 --> 01:40:30,401
<i>- Fine.
- It's really you.</i>

1182
01:40:30,472 --> 01:40:32,804
It really is.

1183
01:40:33,809 --> 01:40:36,402
The big star
pays the little actor a visit.

1184
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:41,179
You know what I was thinking about?
I was thinking about my life.

1185
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,978
I was thinking about the opening.

1186
01:40:44,054 --> 01:40:46,045
Now, I wanna get some sleep.

1187
01:40:47,822 --> 01:40:49,950
Do you love me?

1188
01:40:50,025 --> 01:40:52,186
I'm gonna close this door now.

1189
01:40:52,260 --> 01:40:55,491
What am I asking? What am I asking?
Come on, take a chance.

1190
01:40:55,562 --> 01:40:58,691
Listen, look, let's take this play,
let's dump it upside down...

1191
01:40:58,766 --> 01:41:01,565
and see if we can't find
something human in it.

1192
01:41:01,636 --> 01:41:03,572
I mean, there has to be more...

1193
01:41:03,638 --> 01:41:07,630
when two people have cared
for each other for a long time...

1194
01:41:08,642 --> 01:41:11,041
besides agony.

1195
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:12,908
Heh?

1196
01:41:12,981 --> 01:41:14,917
Are you with me?

1197
01:41:18,553 --> 01:41:20,544
I'm not bitter at you.

1198
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:31,698
Ah, this is not right. No.

1199
01:41:33,268 --> 01:41:35,395
- You are a -
- It's because I know you.

1200
01:41:36,737 --> 01:41:41,039
I know you very well. I know you want me
to make an ass of myself on that stage.

1201
01:41:44,345 --> 01:41:47,337
<i>Well, they don't pay me enough to make
an ass of myself. Do you understand?</i>

1202
01:42:03,731 --> 01:42:06,327
Well, look at this.

1203
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:08,561
You don't invite me in.
You don't -

1204
01:42:10,705 --> 01:42:13,197
don't offer me a cup of coffee,
a cigarette.

1205
01:42:15,743 --> 01:42:17,232
Well?

1206
01:42:24,317 --> 01:42:26,548
Well...

1207
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:30,421
Iove moves at a hell of a rate
of speed, doesn't it?

1208
01:42:31,426 --> 01:42:33,359
What -Where - Leo? Leo!

1209
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:38,423
Where the hell's he going?

1210
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:48,375
<i>Two hundred thousand dollar
advance! I gotta give that money back!</i>

1211
01:42:48,443 --> 01:42:51,376
The situation remains the same.

1212
01:42:51,444 --> 01:42:53,379
The ads have been bought.
The money-

1213
01:42:53,446 --> 01:42:56,043
<i>Wait! The money's been spent. They're in.</i>

1214
01:42:56,117 --> 01:42:58,744
I don't care if the theater's
burning down. Not now.

1215
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:02,118
It's Miss Gordon.
She's on the phone.

1216
01:43:07,395 --> 01:43:09,626
From, uh, Miss Gordon.

1217
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:14,795
What phone? What phone?

1218
01:43:14,868 --> 01:43:16,528
The other phone.

1219
01:43:16,601 --> 01:43:18,263
Backstage, upstairs.

1220
01:43:18,339 --> 01:43:21,936
- It's the phone you got the call
from Philadelphia on.
- All right, all right, all right.

1221
01:43:22,011 --> 01:43:24,672
Manny, I'm going out of my mind!

1222
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:26,680
Be with you in a minute!

1223
01:43:26,747 --> 01:43:29,181
<i>This wall here, right?</i>

1224
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:36,987
Hello. Myrtle. Myrtle?

1225
01:43:38,726 --> 01:43:41,217
That son of a bitch!

1226
01:43:41,294 --> 01:43:43,228
<i>- Jimmy, come here.
- Is she all right?</i>

1227
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:45,229
<i>Is she coming?</i>

1228
01:43:45,297 --> 01:43:47,290
Did you talk to her?

1229
01:43:47,367 --> 01:43:50,097
What did she say?

1230
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,103
- Was she sober?
- I don't think so.

1231
01:43:52,171 --> 01:43:54,868
Did you tell her we had search parties
out for her, the police, everybody?

1232
01:43:54,943 --> 01:43:57,606
<i>- Yeah, but is she all right?
- She said she was fine.</i>

1233
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,612
<i>- What else did she say?
- Nothing.</i>

1234
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,913
She said she'd be here in time
to get dressed on opening night.

1235
01:44:02,984 --> 01:44:05,250
- Hey, what's happening?
- Well -

1236
01:44:05,321 --> 01:44:08,412
- Anything else?
- No.

1237
01:44:08,486 --> 01:44:10,184
What happened?

1238
01:45:30,773 --> 01:45:33,203
Quarter of 7:00.

1239
01:45:33,271 --> 01:45:35,264
So what if it is?

1240
01:45:40,111 --> 01:45:42,103
Where the hell can she be?

1241
01:45:43,184 --> 01:45:45,114
What difference does it make?

1242
01:45:45,183 --> 01:45:47,381
Either she'll be here, or she won't.

1243
01:45:47,455 --> 01:45:49,784
She'll be ready, or she won't.

1244
01:45:50,790 --> 01:45:54,488
Can't say I'm not depressed,
but it's not the end of my life.

1245
01:45:54,563 --> 01:45:57,156
What are we gonna do?

1246
01:45:57,230 --> 01:46:00,164
Say she was hit by a car?

1247
01:46:00,231 --> 01:46:02,222
Got pneumonia?

1248
01:46:03,603 --> 01:46:05,594
What do you wanna do, Sarah?

1249
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:08,628
We'll just have to wait.

1250
01:46:43,209 --> 01:46:46,768
- Anyone?
- What the hell's the point of drinking now?

1251
01:46:46,846 --> 01:46:49,280
We're calm.

1252
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:51,178
Depressed.

1253
01:46:51,248 --> 01:46:54,243
There's a difference between
being calm and being depressed.

1254
01:46:56,291 --> 01:47:00,453
You know, with all the pressure
the whole time we were in New Haven...

1255
01:47:00,526 --> 01:47:03,961
even when she went wrong,
she made me laugh.

1256
01:47:04,028 --> 01:47:09,161
In some crazy way, with all of
her craziness and all of her nuttiness...

1257
01:47:09,238 --> 01:47:12,638
it was more real for me
being up than being in it.

1258
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,631
In some nutty way,
it seemed like something real.

1259
01:47:18,743 --> 01:47:21,406
I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

1260
01:47:22,415 --> 01:47:24,179
Where the hell is she?

1261
01:47:47,808 --> 01:47:49,740
I feel rotten. Don't you?

1262
01:47:49,808 --> 01:47:53,746
Yeah. I don't think
I'm gonna celebrate or anything.

1263
01:47:59,384 --> 01:48:02,980
- You know, we've got reputations and -
- Yeah.

1264
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:06,690
- Well...
- I don't know.

1265
01:48:06,758 --> 01:48:08,749
you know about reputations.

1266
01:48:09,962 --> 01:48:14,126
As a good friend of mine once said,
reputations are money.

1267
01:48:15,768 --> 01:48:19,795
Yeah, Dave, I know, but I don't know
what'll cut out this lousy feeling...

1268
01:48:19,873 --> 01:48:22,500
of embarrassment and shame.

1269
01:48:22,575 --> 01:48:24,770
We -

1270
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:28,835
Do you know there are people
out there waiting to see -

1271
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:33,615
And you've backed many a fine play...

1272
01:48:33,686 --> 01:48:35,983
and I've written
a lot of good ones, you know.

1273
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:37,810
Ohh!

1274
01:49:40,918 --> 01:49:43,615
Manny!

1275
01:49:43,688 --> 01:49:46,351
- Kelly, she's here!
- Oh, thank God!

1276
01:49:47,695 --> 01:49:49,683
<i>- What's up?
- That's all right.</i>

1277
01:49:51,095 --> 01:49:53,325
Sarah! Sarah!

1278
01:49:54,531 --> 01:49:56,466
Christ!

1279
01:49:59,370 --> 01:50:02,168
Manny. Thank God. She's here.

1280
01:50:02,241 --> 01:50:04,834
- What?
- She's here.

1281
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:07,170
All right, get everybody
out of the hallway. Now.

1282
01:50:07,244 --> 01:50:09,179
- Everybody?
- Now. Out.

1283
01:50:09,247 --> 01:50:12,044
- All right, out of the hallway, please.
- What's up?

1284
01:50:12,114 --> 01:50:15,576
Uh, everything's fine. She's here.
Get ready. Get your clothes on.

1285
01:50:25,094 --> 01:50:27,895
<i>Manny?</i>

1286
01:50:30,736 --> 01:50:33,727
I'm late.

1287
01:50:36,507 --> 01:50:38,439
<i>Just walk away.</i>

1288
01:50:39,444 --> 01:50:41,934
<i>Go up front.
Do whatever it is you do.</i>

1289
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,465
All right.

1290
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:08,668
I'm late.

1291
01:51:08,739 --> 01:51:11,732
We'll get some coffee in you.
Then we'll see.

1292
01:51:19,517 --> 01:51:21,450
Buddy.

1293
01:51:28,691 --> 01:51:31,253
- Ow.
- Leave her alone, Leo. She'll get up.

1294
01:51:32,296 --> 01:51:34,229
Leave her alone.

1295
01:51:43,908 --> 01:51:46,397
Don't help her, Leo.
I said don't help her, goddamn it!

1296
01:51:46,475 --> 01:51:48,967
- Manny-
- Leave her alone!

1297
01:51:56,056 --> 01:51:58,486
Oh, horseshit!

1298
01:51:58,557 --> 01:52:01,785
- Get up.
- Leave her, goddamn it!

1299
01:52:01,857 --> 01:52:04,191
<i>- You stay away!
- I don't wanna hear it!</i>

1300
01:52:06,529 --> 01:52:08,465
What does it prove?

1301
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:22,213
All right, walk.

1302
01:52:24,145 --> 01:52:26,082
Walk.

1303
01:52:32,755 --> 01:52:35,690
<i>Come on.</i>

1304
01:52:35,758 --> 01:52:37,956
<i>Come on, hon.</i>

1305
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:40,021
<i>You can make it. Come on.</i>

1306
01:52:44,034 --> 01:52:46,025
All right, Leo, let her go.

1307
01:52:47,171 --> 01:52:49,160
Walk away, Leo!

1308
01:52:50,173 --> 01:52:52,005
She can't make it!

1309
01:52:54,244 --> 01:52:56,237
She's out.

1310
01:53:20,637 --> 01:53:22,765
Come on. Come on.

1311
01:53:29,711 --> 01:53:32,704
- All right, leave us.
- All right, Kelly, let's go.

1312
01:53:54,604 --> 01:53:56,970
Want me to leave?

1313
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,700
No, no.

1314
01:53:58,776 --> 01:54:00,606
You're part of the family.

1315
01:54:01,708 --> 01:54:03,702
What the hell's the difference?

1316
01:54:05,383 --> 01:54:08,374
I can't believe
she'd walk in this drunk.

1317
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:15,188
- Manny?
- I'm closing the show. We're closing.

1318
01:54:25,869 --> 01:54:28,497
- She's here. She's here! Places!
- All right!

1319
01:54:28,572 --> 01:54:31,700
Where's Jimmy? Jimmy!
Get the cast on.

1320
01:54:31,774 --> 01:54:33,503
She's here. Come on! Quickly!

1321
01:54:33,577 --> 01:54:35,306
<i>Go around back!</i>

1322
01:54:36,947 --> 01:54:40,109
She's here!
Uh, all right, everybody!

1323
01:54:40,182 --> 01:54:43,585
We'll be going on in a few minutes!
Five, ten, I'm not sure.

1324
01:54:43,654 --> 01:54:47,749
Now, get your clothes on, come downstage!
We'll be going! All right!

1325
01:54:47,823 --> 01:54:51,816
Everything is fine!
We'll be going out! Thank you!

1326
01:54:51,894 --> 01:54:53,385
Thank you!

1327
01:54:55,197 --> 01:54:57,722
<i>Makeup?</i>

1328
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:59,666
Yes.

1329
01:55:00,672 --> 01:55:02,661
Sweetheart, drink this.

1330
01:55:10,276 --> 01:55:13,342
Hey.

1331
01:55:14,617 --> 01:55:17,917
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a foolish woman.

1332
01:55:17,988 --> 01:55:21,650
Yeah, well, I'll bet you six-to-five
you don't make it out of this dressing room.

1333
01:55:21,725 --> 01:55:24,715
You make it to your second entrance,
you know who's gonna be waiting for you?

1334
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:27,721
<i>Maurice.</i>

1335
01:55:27,796 --> 01:55:29,559
Embarrassing.

1336
01:55:30,869 --> 01:55:34,564
Now, David, I know this is crazy,
merely conjecture...

1337
01:55:34,637 --> 01:55:36,503
but she's drunk enough -

1338
01:55:36,573 --> 01:55:39,564
- I'm alone.
- I bet the audience is gonna love her.

1339
01:55:39,641 --> 01:55:41,906
No, I'm not alone. I'm not alone.

1340
01:55:41,976 --> 01:55:43,706
- I've been married.
- Leo.

1341
01:55:43,778 --> 01:55:46,613
- You should tell Mr. Victor, Mr. Samuels...
- I been with this guy three years.

1342
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:50,208
Miss Goode, that I don't know
what to do about the audience.

1343
01:55:50,287 --> 01:55:54,053
- Five minutes, Jimmy. We'll be there.
- They're rowdy. The catcalls.

1344
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:56,058
<i>- Out!
- I don't think we can hold them.</i>

1345
01:55:56,126 --> 01:55:59,755
- Leave! Out!
- After that, I was just floating.

1346
01:56:02,132 --> 01:56:04,258
I, uh, think, uh...

1347
01:56:05,368 --> 01:56:08,301
we'll have to make
some kind of announcement.

1348
01:56:08,368 --> 01:56:10,305
<i>I would always think of Tony.</i>

1349
01:56:10,373 --> 01:56:13,035
<i>Leo.</i>

1350
01:56:13,108 --> 01:56:14,805
Five minutes, Manny?

1351
01:56:14,878 --> 01:56:16,810
Perhaps she can do it.

1352
01:56:16,878 --> 01:56:18,871
<i>I think of Tony.</i>

1353
01:56:22,485 --> 01:56:25,649
I never had any children.
I don't care about 'em.

1354
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:50,770
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1355
01:56:50,843 --> 01:56:54,977
Our producer, Mr. David Samuels,
would like to say a few words to you.

1356
01:56:59,053 --> 01:57:02,047
<i>Mr. Samuels.</i>

1357
01:57:04,993 --> 01:57:06,928
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1358
01:57:06,995 --> 01:57:10,087
May I - May I really apologize
for this long wait...

1359
01:57:10,165 --> 01:57:12,997
and, uh, thank you
for your patience.

1360
01:57:13,069 --> 01:57:17,834
We've had a, uh, a small disturbance
and a problem backstage...

1361
01:57:17,904 --> 01:57:20,840
and the curtain will go up
in a minute.

1362
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:23,402
<i>Thank you.</i>

1363
01:57:31,286 --> 01:57:34,415
Okay, props in place?
Everybody ready?

1364
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:37,051
Curtain going up. Places.

1365
01:57:37,892 --> 01:57:40,827
House lights down.
Places, please.

1366
01:57:40,895 --> 01:57:42,830
Curtain!

1367
01:58:02,582 --> 01:58:04,916
<i>Son, come here. Vito.</i>

1368
01:58:04,988 --> 01:58:07,613
<i>Son, take this $20...</i>

1369
01:58:07,688 --> 01:58:10,123
<i>and take these people
to the movies.</i>

1370
01:58:10,192 --> 01:58:13,286
<i>Come on, let's go! Let's move it!
Let's move it, let's move it!</i>

1371
01:58:13,362 --> 01:58:15,557
<i>Go! Let's go! Come on!</i>

1372
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:17,756
<i>Vito! Son, come here. Vito.</i>

1373
01:58:19,034 --> 01:58:22,059
<i>Take this $20
and take these people--</i>

1374
01:58:28,742 --> 01:58:30,404
<i>Hey, there's a woman here!</i>

1375
01:58:30,478 --> 01:58:32,412
<i>Hi. My name is Vito.</i>

1376
01:58:35,082 --> 01:58:38,078
<i>Virginia! Hey, wait a minute!
Hold it!</i>

1377
01:58:39,754 --> 01:58:42,188
<i>What the hell are you doing, Tony?</i>

1378
01:58:50,231 --> 01:58:52,165
Okay. Okay.

1379
01:58:52,233 --> 01:58:55,171
<i>You find out
what the hell is going on around here!</i>

1380
01:58:55,238 --> 01:58:58,397
<i>- I'm okay.
- Come back in the room!</i>

1381
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:05,040
Damn him!
Been married to a nut for 15 years!

1382
01:59:06,546 --> 01:59:10,075
<i>- Charlie, get away from that door!
- It's your show now.</i>

1383
01:59:10,152 --> 01:59:13,086
If it becomes too impossible,
you ring down the curtain. Understand?

1384
01:59:13,155 --> 01:59:14,813
All right, Manny.

1385
01:59:16,056 --> 01:59:18,995
<i>Keep pumping coffee into her.
Black coffee.</i>

1386
01:59:29,169 --> 01:59:32,103
<i>I don't know. I don't care.</i>

1387
01:59:32,171 --> 01:59:35,439
<i>- Do you think he knows her?
- Yeah, he knows her.</i>

1388
01:59:35,509 --> 01:59:37,445
<i>- It's the first wife.
- Wife?</i>

1389
01:59:37,513 --> 01:59:39,945
<i>- He had her by the wrist.
- Did he hurt her?</i>

1390
01:59:40,014 --> 01:59:43,005
<i>You think I'm gonna interfere
in that kind ofbullshit?
- You sure?</i>

1391
01:59:45,287 --> 01:59:49,485
It's a shock for me to see you. I'm not
seeing you on a street corner somewhere.

1392
01:59:49,557 --> 01:59:51,491
I didn't bump into you in a crowd.

1393
02:00:02,136 --> 02:00:05,071
<i>What the hell is going on here?
Who is this dame?</i>

1394
02:00:05,139 --> 02:00:07,072
<i>This is Virginia.</i>

1395
02:00:07,141 --> 02:00:10,975
<i>This is, uh, my, uh, ex-wife
from 15 years ago.</i>

1396
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:14,608
<i>And this is my new wife.
Say hello to Carla.</i>

1397
02:00:14,683 --> 02:00:17,174
- Hello.
- That's Carla.

1398
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:19,583
Charlie Spikes, my brother-in-law.
Charlie Spikes.

1399
02:00:24,925 --> 02:00:26,858
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

1400
02:00:26,925 --> 02:00:29,329
<i>Goddamn it, no! No!</i>

1401
02:00:29,399 --> 02:00:31,331
<i>No!</i>

1402
02:00:44,247 --> 02:00:47,577
I've gotta get a glass of water.
I can't -

1403
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:51,973
<i>Never mind the water.
I said, what do you want?</i>

1404
02:00:52,051 --> 02:00:53,985
<i>Dad's gonna hit you again.</i>

1405
02:00:54,053 --> 02:00:56,990
What kind of woman are you?

1406
02:00:57,058 --> 02:00:59,993
Hey. Come here. Sit down.

1407
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,995
- Sit down.
- Let go of my arm.

1408
02:01:02,064 --> 02:01:03,995
- I said sit down!
- Stop it, Dad.

1409
02:01:04,064 --> 02:01:06,361
- Sit down.
- Take it easy. You're bigger than she is.

1410
02:01:06,435 --> 02:01:08,368
Hey, Tony, leave my house!

1411
02:01:08,436 --> 02:01:11,371
Goddamn it, leave my house!

1412
02:01:11,438 --> 02:01:15,272
- How dare you act like this?
- Leave him alone! How dare you!

1413
02:01:15,342 --> 02:01:19,005
Look, I - I even wore this veil
because...

1414
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,740
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1415
02:01:23,784 --> 02:01:25,717
I'm sorry, I -

1416
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:30,623
<i>I'm a very foolish woman, and I--
This is very embarrassing.</i>

1417
02:01:31,892 --> 02:01:34,052
<i>It's just that...</i>

1418
02:01:34,127 --> 02:01:36,689
I'm alone.

1419
02:01:36,763 --> 02:01:40,825
<i>No, I'm not alone. I've been living
with this guy for- for several years...</i>

1420
02:01:40,903 --> 02:01:44,099
<i>and-and I was married
to someone else before Tony...</i>

1421
02:01:44,171 --> 02:01:47,265
<i>and I don't--
I don't even know where he is.</i>

1422
02:01:48,307 --> 02:01:50,970
<i>I was just--</i>

1423
02:01:51,043 --> 02:01:53,775
<i>I was just floating around...</i>

1424
02:01:53,847 --> 02:01:55,781
<i>and I--</i>

1425
02:01:55,849 --> 02:01:58,784
<i>- Go on.
- You were married, you and him.</i>

1426
02:01:58,851 --> 02:02:01,287
- Right, honey?
- Yeah, but it didn't mean anything.

1427
02:02:01,355 --> 02:02:05,121
It was just for a little - little bit of time.
It didn't mean anything.

1428
02:02:05,193 --> 02:02:08,560
- You have any kids?
- No. No.

1429
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:10,563
I don't have any kids.

1430
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:13,225
Virginia. Virginia!

1431
02:02:13,301 --> 02:02:15,496
<i>- Come on.
- Tony.</i>

1432
02:02:15,567 --> 02:02:17,762
<i>- Hey, Tony.
- In the bedroom.</i>

1433
02:02:19,072 --> 02:02:21,541
- Put her down, Tony.
- Leave me alone, will ya, Lena?

1434
02:02:21,609 --> 02:02:23,336
This woman is hurt.

1435
02:02:23,408 --> 02:02:25,435
<i>I'm not gonna do anything.</i>

1436
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:28,913
<i>- Put her down, Tony.
- I'm gonna lay her down on the bed.</i>

1437
02:02:28,982 --> 02:02:31,746
<i>Come on, we all love you, Tony.</i>

1438
02:02:31,819 --> 02:02:34,809
<i>You wanna hit me?
Go ahead and hit me.</i>

1439
02:02:42,262 --> 02:02:43,989
<i>Tony? Tony?</i>

1440
02:02:44,998 --> 02:02:48,661
<i>Come on, Tony.
We all love you, Tony.</i>

1441
02:02:48,734 --> 02:02:51,669
You wanna hit me?
Go ahead and hit me.

1442
02:02:51,737 --> 02:02:53,672
<i>You're my friend.
You're my best friend.</i>

1443
02:02:55,744 --> 02:02:59,109
<i>Everybody loves you.
Your kids love you.</i>

1444
02:02:59,179 --> 02:03:01,705
Come on.

1445
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,514
Come on, baby, it's coffee time. Let's go.

1446
02:03:32,243 --> 02:03:34,407
- A double scotch, please!
- Double scotch.

1447
02:03:51,597 --> 02:03:53,589
<i>Do you love me?</i>

1448
02:04:37,242 --> 02:04:39,176
Honey, you better get her dressed.

1449
02:04:39,244 --> 02:04:41,572
- Better hurry. We don't have much time.
- Okay.

1450
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:47,546
Come on. Here we go.

1451
02:04:49,222 --> 02:04:52,018
It's going to be fine.

1452
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:54,525
Easy. Easy does it.

1453
02:04:54,595 --> 02:04:57,186
Oh, yeah, you're gonna be fine now.

1454
02:04:58,230 --> 02:05:00,165
You were really good.

1455
02:05:00,233 --> 02:05:04,796
Yeah, you were just -just fine.
If we can just get over this -

1456
02:05:04,871 --> 02:05:07,804
Okay, straighten up. Here we go.

1457
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:09,806
You're gonna make it.

1458
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:22,951
- You all right?
- Terrific.

1459
02:05:28,462 --> 02:05:30,396
Places, please.

1460
02:05:43,976 --> 02:05:45,910
The show's going well.

1461
02:05:45,980 --> 02:05:47,912
We'll all have some champagne later.

1462
02:05:47,981 --> 02:05:50,414
Or whatever.

1463
02:05:50,481 --> 02:05:52,418
You're terrific.

1464
02:06:06,997 --> 02:06:09,158
I'm gonna bury that bastard.

1465
02:06:15,173 --> 02:06:16,904
I think it's going very well.

1466
02:06:16,975 --> 02:06:19,409
Keys, please.

1467
02:06:19,478 --> 02:06:22,935
<i>- House lights down.
- See ya on stage.</i>

1468
02:06:23,014 --> 02:06:25,178
<i>- Okay.
- Places, please!</i>

1469
02:06:27,287 --> 02:06:29,221
<i>Curtain!</i>

1470
02:06:38,530 --> 02:06:40,792
<i>Hello?</i>

1471
02:06:40,866 --> 02:06:44,199
<i>Oh. Hello. How are you?</i>

1472
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:49,268
<i>No, your sister isn't here.</i>

1473
02:06:49,341 --> 02:06:51,331
<i>No. No.</i>

1474
02:06:52,379 --> 02:06:54,869
<i>No--</i>

1475
02:06:54,948 --> 02:06:57,812
<i>- Oh, she told you.
- Come on, baby.</i>

1476
02:06:57,881 --> 02:07:00,747
<i>Well... there you are.</i>

1477
02:07:04,054 --> 02:07:06,047
<i>No, there's no--
there's no point.</i>

1478
02:07:08,026 --> 02:07:10,459
<i>- I said, there's no point.
- Miss Gordon?</i>

1479
02:07:10,527 --> 02:07:12,861
- Can I say something?
- Sure.

1480
02:07:13,863 --> 02:07:15,797
I've seen a lot of drunks in my day...

1481
02:07:15,866 --> 02:07:18,802
but I never seen anybody as drunk as you
and still be able to walk.

1482
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:20,998
You're fantastic!

1483
02:07:21,075 --> 02:07:23,905
- Thank you, Bobby.
- Okay.

1484
02:07:24,979 --> 02:07:28,309
<i>That's right. That's right.</i>

1485
02:07:30,083 --> 02:07:32,774
<i>I'm not hostile. No.</i>

1486
02:07:32,847 --> 02:07:35,343
<i>No, I don't care.</i>

1487
02:07:35,421 --> 02:07:38,354
<i>Because I'm goddamned sick and tired
of walking into this house...</i>

1488
02:07:38,422 --> 02:07:40,414
<i>and finding it empty, that's why.</i>

1489
02:07:41,526 --> 02:07:43,962
<i>Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

1490
02:07:44,028 --> 02:07:47,430
<i>Look, I can't talk now, all right?
I'm gonna hang up.</i>

1491
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:50,433
<i>Okay, well, listen,
it'll either work out or it won't.</i>

1492
02:07:57,675 --> 02:08:00,143
Great.

1493
02:08:00,210 --> 02:08:02,512
This is funny, you know.

1494
02:08:04,148 --> 02:08:06,082
It's very funny.

1495
02:08:07,753 --> 02:08:09,686
Hysterical.

1496
02:08:11,624 --> 02:08:13,555
You want to recap it?

1497
02:08:17,127 --> 02:08:19,288
All right, I run off...

1498
02:08:20,302 --> 02:08:22,232
to the Beverly Hills Hotel...

1499
02:08:22,301 --> 02:08:25,292
and I find myself
a little, innocent girl...

1500
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:27,803
and I sit there with her...

1501
02:08:27,872 --> 02:08:30,864
and all she can think about
is my graying temples.

1502
02:08:32,376 --> 02:08:34,309
And you run off with -

1503
02:08:34,377 --> 02:08:36,369
<i>Do you love me?</i>

1504
02:08:40,218 --> 02:08:42,152
Listen, Marty...

1505
02:08:45,992 --> 02:08:49,016
you object to my going out, right?

1506
02:08:49,092 --> 02:08:51,027
Yes, I do.

1507
02:08:51,095 --> 02:08:53,688
<i>- And my drinking?
- Yes.</i>

1508
02:08:53,762 --> 02:08:57,027
<i>Somehow, a cocktail here and there
is very destructive.</i>

1509
02:08:57,098 --> 02:08:59,264
Yes, I think it is, very.

1510
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:03,501
Well, I've heard
your every point of view.

1511
02:09:03,575 --> 02:09:07,373
Every story you tell
turns out the same way.

1512
02:09:07,444 --> 02:09:09,605
A constant, long-winded recital...

1513
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:12,444
about what's wrong
with everyone in the whole world.

1514
02:09:12,516 --> 02:09:16,920
<i>I tell you what I think
is important for you!</i>

1515
02:09:18,291 --> 02:09:20,520
Well, I am not me.

1516
02:09:21,527 --> 02:09:23,889
I used to be me.

1517
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:26,895
<i>- I'm not me anymore.
- What the hell do you want from me?</i>

1518
02:09:26,964 --> 02:09:29,957
<i>You want me to get down on my knees?
What the hell do you want?</i>

1519
02:09:30,968 --> 02:09:33,835
Everything you can't give me.

1520
02:09:33,904 --> 02:09:36,337
I want youth...

1521
02:09:36,407 --> 02:09:38,932
super strength...

1522
02:09:39,009 --> 02:09:42,070
dream building, happiness,
fun, emotion.

1523
02:09:42,146 --> 02:09:44,412
<i>- Babe.
- Practically anything.</i>

1524
02:09:44,482 --> 02:09:46,179
<i>- Babe, I love you.
- No, no, no.</i>

1525
02:09:46,251 --> 02:09:48,684
I love you! I am Superman!

1526
02:09:48,753 --> 02:09:50,688
- Hey!
- I am Superman!

1527
02:09:50,755 --> 02:09:53,687
Oh, you're weird!
And you make me feel old.

1528
02:09:53,758 --> 02:09:56,452
<i>I am so strong
you can't believe it.</i>

1529
02:09:56,526 --> 02:09:58,621
- Hey, M -
- I am -Aaah! Aaah!

1530
02:09:58,697 --> 02:10:02,064
<i>Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!</i>

1531
02:10:02,132 --> 02:10:04,068
I am Superman!

1532
02:10:12,844 --> 02:10:14,504
<i>- What -
- We are not we!</i>

1533
02:10:14,577 --> 02:10:17,103
<i>- What are we fighting about, Marty?
- We are--</i>

1534
02:10:21,017 --> 02:10:23,949
<i>What are we fighting about, Marty?</i>

1535
02:10:24,018 --> 02:10:28,015
We are absolutely different people
than we were.

1536
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:37,429
When I look at my face in the mirror
when I'm shaving in the morning...

1537
02:10:37,502 --> 02:10:39,491
you know what I see?

1538
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:43,097
I can see it then in my face.

1539
02:10:43,172 --> 02:10:45,166
It's hard to cover it up.

1540
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:50,438
- What?
- There's something deeply cynical
about my face.

1541
02:10:58,020 --> 02:11:00,617
It's hard to cover it up.

1542
02:11:00,691 --> 02:11:02,625
- Congratulations.
- It's hard to cover it up.

1543
02:11:05,096 --> 02:11:08,085
It is very hard to cover it up!

1544
02:11:09,869 --> 02:11:12,358
<i>My heart -</i>

1545
02:11:15,371 --> 02:11:18,862
<i>My heart pounds!
Do you understand?</i>

1546
02:11:18,942 --> 02:11:20,875
My heart pounds! It pounds!

1547
02:11:20,943 --> 02:11:24,177
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bum!
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bum!
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bum!

1548
02:11:28,953 --> 02:11:31,546
<i>My stomach is empty...</i>

1549
02:11:31,620 --> 02:11:34,284
<i>and I feel like screaming.</i>

1550
02:11:34,355 --> 02:11:36,291
I am restless...

1551
02:11:38,463 --> 02:11:40,396
with this pose.

1552
02:11:40,464 --> 02:11:42,898
Well, I am not me!

1553
02:11:43,901 --> 02:11:47,336
<i>And I know that I am
someone else!</i>

1554
02:11:47,402 --> 02:11:50,237
- Do you think I am too?
- Yes!

1555
02:11:53,376 --> 02:11:55,674
Okay, it's definite, then.

1556
02:11:59,916 --> 02:12:02,441
<i>We've been invaded!</i>

1557
02:12:04,289 --> 02:12:06,312
There's someone posing here as us.

1558
02:12:06,389 --> 02:12:10,826
<i>And you're right. There is something
definitely wrong with your smile.</i>

1559
02:12:22,372 --> 02:12:24,840
<i>There's one question I'd like answered.</i>

1560
02:12:24,908 --> 02:12:27,671
<i>- I've gotta go.
- Yes? What is it?</i>

1561
02:12:29,846 --> 02:12:32,576
<i>What do you suppose they've done with us?</i>

1562
02:12:36,352 --> 02:12:38,582
<i>Do you think they killed us?</i>

1563
02:12:39,621 --> 02:12:41,614
<i>Do you think they murdered us?</i>

1564
02:12:42,725 --> 02:12:44,716
<i>Do you think we're dead?</i>

1565
02:12:47,563 --> 02:12:50,896
<i>Or do you think
we'rejust losing our sense ofhumor?</i>

1566
02:12:55,137 --> 02:12:57,073
<i>Do you know I used to be
very funny?</i>

1567
02:13:01,877 --> 02:13:03,814
Whoa!

1568
02:13:03,882 --> 02:13:06,074
When were you ever funny?

1569
02:13:07,083 --> 02:13:10,314
<i>- When was I ever funny?
- I've never heard you tell one stinking joke!</i>

1570
02:13:10,385 --> 02:13:13,717
<i>- And you never laugh at anyone else's!
Never! Never!
- I used to be funny!</i>

1571
02:13:13,787 --> 02:13:15,722
<i>- I used to be very funny.
- When?</i>

1572
02:13:15,792 --> 02:13:17,728
When I was a kid.

1573
02:13:22,465 --> 02:13:24,956
<i>- Marty, I've got it.
- Good.</i>

1574
02:13:25,034 --> 02:13:26,968
I've got the answer.

1575
02:13:27,035 --> 02:13:28,834
<i>Good.</i>

1576
02:13:28,904 --> 02:13:31,999
Marty, this is terrific. Terrific!

1577
02:13:32,073 --> 02:13:36,444
This is a wonderful idea.
It's just so easy that it's silly.

1578
02:13:36,512 --> 02:13:38,446
It's, uh -

1579
02:13:38,514 --> 02:13:41,778
<i>- Isn't it marvelous the way the mind works?
- Yes.</i>

1580
02:13:42,782 --> 02:13:44,718
<i>I mean, it's, uh, it's sick...</i>

1581
02:13:44,787 --> 02:13:46,721
<i>the way the mind works.</i>

1582
02:13:53,295 --> 02:13:56,390
Listen, it's easy.
It's so easy.

1583
02:13:56,465 --> 02:13:59,400
The telephone rings.
You answer it, right?

1584
02:13:59,468 --> 02:14:01,460
You get sick,
you go to the doctor.

1585
02:14:01,537 --> 02:14:03,336
Your heart gets broken...

1586
02:14:04,375 --> 02:14:06,136
you get someone else.

1587
02:14:07,976 --> 02:14:11,912
We're grim, right? We're grim
and we're depressed and we're "yecch."

1588
02:14:11,980 --> 02:14:14,915
We don't have to sit here and take this.
We can turn on the lights.

1589
02:14:14,982 --> 02:14:16,973
We can dance a little.
We can -

1590
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:20,952
If we need touching,
we can touch each other.

1591
02:14:21,956 --> 02:14:23,891
Hey, Marty, we have each other.

1592
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:26,327
Virginia, for God's sake,
I don't want to take -

1593
02:14:26,397 --> 02:14:29,264
Hey, no, honest, this is simple.
It's simple.

1594
02:14:29,332 --> 02:14:32,895
Honest to God, this is the best idea.
It's just so simple...

1595
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:34,902
you don't see it.

1596
02:15:03,565 --> 02:15:06,498
It means I love you.
That's what it means. I love you!

1597
02:15:06,567 --> 02:15:09,263
I don't care if you don't think
I'm beautiful anymore.

1598
02:15:09,337 --> 02:15:11,272
<i>- I do.
- And you don't think I'm funny.</i>

1599
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:14,002
<i>You're hysterical.</i>

1600
02:15:16,478 --> 02:15:19,470
<i>Well, you don't think I'm capable.</i>

1601
02:15:19,550 --> 02:15:21,982
<i>I don't think you're capable, no.</i>

1602
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:25,609
<i>Because I swear to God, I never thought
about if you were capable or not.</i>

1603
02:15:25,686 --> 02:15:28,251
<i>Yes, but now you will, see?</i>

1604
02:15:28,326 --> 02:15:32,121
<i>Now you'll think about it, and because
you think about it, I'll be it.</i>

1605
02:15:32,194 --> 02:15:34,629
<i>Because that's what I wanna be.
I wanna be capable.</i>

1606
02:15:34,697 --> 02:15:36,631
<i>Okay, you're capable!</i>

1607
02:15:36,699 --> 02:15:41,032
<i>You're capable and pretty and young and
wonderful and great and outstanding and--</i>

1608
02:15:41,103 --> 02:15:43,163
<i>And I love you!</i>

1609
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,230
<i>And you love me.</i>

1610
02:15:47,742 --> 02:15:51,042
<i>And if I get angry with you,
I punch you right in the nose. Is that right?</i>

1611
02:15:51,113 --> 02:15:53,742
<i>No. If you get angry,
you get over it.</i>

1612
02:15:53,816 --> 02:15:57,216
- It's a lousy idea.
- If you're depressed, you get over it.

1613
02:15:57,285 --> 02:16:01,052
If you're selfish -
which you are, 90% of the time, Marty-

1614
02:16:02,057 --> 02:16:03,990
<i>well, you give me a chance.</i>

1615
02:16:04,057 --> 02:16:06,048
All right, angry- happy.
Depressed - happy.

1616
02:16:06,126 --> 02:16:09,154
The other way- happy.
Changing - happy.

1617
02:16:09,232 --> 02:16:11,496
Killing - happy.
Depressed, angry- happy.

1618
02:16:11,567 --> 02:16:13,500
Everything is happy, right?
That's the answer.

1619
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:17,834
<i>- This is so brilliant.
- Worst idea I've ever heard in my entire life.</i>

1620
02:16:17,907 --> 02:16:20,567
<i>It's just so simple, you reject it.</i>

1621
02:16:25,446 --> 02:16:27,439
I'm getting older.

1622
02:16:31,451 --> 02:16:33,852
What do we do about that?

1623
02:16:37,725 --> 02:16:41,719
- I do want to be your friend.
- Yeah, well, I don't want to be your friend.

1624
02:16:43,766 --> 02:16:46,701
Oh, come on,
let's be friends, Marty.

1625
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:51,762
No.

1626
02:16:54,677 --> 02:16:57,338
Well, I sure would like to be friends.

1627
02:17:03,652 --> 02:17:05,584
Put 'er there.

1628
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:26,828
Okay. Okay.

1629
02:17:29,845 --> 02:17:31,775
Stand up, please.

1630
02:17:33,747 --> 02:17:36,842
- Want to see something wonderful?
- Yes!

1631
02:17:51,869 --> 02:17:55,167
Uh, how about
if you stand over here?

1632
02:17:55,237 --> 02:17:57,668
<i>All right.</i>

1633
02:17:58,739 --> 02:18:01,732
Okay, then I'm
standing over here, right?

1634
02:18:02,778 --> 02:18:05,902
- Now, could you do me a favor?
- Certainly.

1635
02:18:07,215 --> 02:18:09,309
Could you raise your right leg?

1636
02:18:10,452 --> 02:18:12,112
The other way, please.

1637
02:18:12,187 --> 02:18:14,744
No. The other way, please.

1638
02:18:17,159 --> 02:18:19,093
No, seriously-

1639
02:18:22,295 --> 02:18:24,457
We will walk to each other...

1640
02:18:24,530 --> 02:18:26,691
<i>- we will try to clasp hands...
- Yes?</i>

1641
02:18:26,766 --> 02:18:31,066
and we will grab each other's leg
as we pass.

1642
02:18:31,137 --> 02:18:35,165
<i>- Oh, that's wonderful!
- This is an athlete's trick.</i>

1643
02:18:35,242 --> 02:18:39,337
<i>- Okay.
- Instead of doing, "Hey, baby! Damn!"</i>

1644
02:18:40,914 --> 02:18:43,441
<i>Now?</i>

1645
02:18:43,518 --> 02:18:47,249
Whenever you say. Ready?

1646
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:50,552
Hey, baby! What do you say!
Ohh! Ohh!

1647
02:18:50,625 --> 02:18:52,819
Yo! Yes! Ohh!

1648
02:18:52,892 --> 02:18:55,157
<i>Okay!</i>

1649
02:18:55,228 --> 02:18:58,162
Let's go! Here we go!

1650
02:19:10,143 --> 02:19:13,772
<i>Bravo! Whoo!</i>

1651
02:19:13,846 --> 02:19:15,781
Whoo!

1652
02:19:18,218 --> 02:19:20,152
<i>Bravo!</i>

1653
02:20:07,568 --> 02:20:09,502
Bravo!

1654
02:20:10,605 --> 02:20:12,538
Bravo!

1655
02:20:15,175 --> 02:20:16,663
Bravo!

1656
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:50,996
You really did it this time!
Here, have some coffee.

1657
02:20:53,814 --> 02:20:55,746
David?

1658
02:20:55,814 --> 02:20:58,341
Ah, Manny.

1659
02:21:01,922 --> 02:21:04,686
Fantastic! Fantastic!

1660
02:21:04,757 --> 02:21:06,886
Hey, Leo, how are you?

1661
02:21:10,899 --> 02:21:12,831
- Fantastic!
- Have a little champagne!

1662
02:21:12,901 --> 02:21:15,334
<i>- I'll take the ice!
- Thank you very much.</i>

1663
02:21:15,402 --> 02:21:17,335
<i>- Please, please.
- Thank you very much.</i>

1664
02:21:17,403 --> 02:21:19,338
<i>Just what I want!</i>

1665
02:21:21,907 --> 02:21:23,843
<i>- Did you love it?
- Wonderful!</i>

1666
02:21:23,912 --> 02:21:27,609
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

1667
02:21:27,683 --> 02:21:29,615
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

1668
02:21:29,682 --> 02:21:31,614
<i>Aww!</i>

1669
02:21:31,682 --> 02:21:33,707
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

1670
02:21:33,785 --> 02:21:36,779
<i>Toast!</i>

1671
02:21:49,936 --> 02:21:52,371
Hello! How are you? Yes.

1672
02:21:52,438 --> 02:21:54,428
How are you? Oh!

1673
02:21:54,507 --> 02:21:56,975
- Just wanted to say I just adored it.
- Did you?

1674
02:21:59,611 --> 02:22:01,739
Myrtle is shaking.

1675
02:22:01,814 --> 02:22:04,281
Myrtle is shaking!

1676
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:07,877
<i>Hey, Bo was smashed backstage!
He won't come out!</i>

1677
02:22:07,954 --> 02:22:09,888
<i>- Come over here.
- Where is he?</i>

1678
02:22:09,954 --> 02:22:11,891
<i>Marvelous!</i>

1679
02:22:13,291 --> 02:22:16,224
I am so drunk,
I can hardly stand on these two feet.

1680
02:22:16,292 --> 02:22:19,231
- I wouldn't have known.
- I will call you when I'm a little clearer.

1681
02:22:19,299 --> 02:22:22,732
- Promise?
- Peter? You know Dorothy, my wife?

1682
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,670
- Peter Bogdanovich.
- Lady- Oh, hi.

1683
02:22:25,738 --> 02:22:29,070
Lady, it's a privilege.

1684
02:22:33,078 --> 02:22:35,070
<i>- You liked it?
- Oh!</i>

1685
02:22:38,318 --> 02:22:42,014
<i>I have so much admiration for you!</i>

1686
02:22:42,087 --> 02:22:45,023
<i>- Mary seemed to think it, uh--
- It was wonderful!</i>

1687
02:22:45,091 --> 02:22:48,526
<i>Wonderful! Wonderful!</i>

1688
02:22:48,592 --> 02:22:50,753
<i>Wonderful!</i>

1689
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,263
<i>Bobby? Bobby!</i>
