00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Why you callin' me that?
You know my name's Claire.</i>

23
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:58,618
<i>So that if anyone else hears, they don't

<i>How can you make her watch you

46
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:41,706
<i>See me now, if that was me,
I wouldn't have it.</i>

47
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>You should spark
in her fuckin' face.</i>

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,419
<i>I don't know, man.
I dashed it, isn't it?</i>

58
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,725
<i>She just... I don't know.</i>

<i>And what you doin' chattin' about alisa?
I fucked that girl a few weeks ago, blood.</i>

when she's supposed to be your girl.</i>

66
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,161
<i>Think you're so bad, isn't it?</i>

<i>Fucked her hard, blood,

00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:38,906
<i>What?</i>

00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,947
<i>Pick it up, man!</i>

98
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,497
<i>Who the fuck you talkin' to?</i>

107
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,983
<i>She ain't no virgin.</i>

108
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:42,031
<i>How the fuck would you know?</i>

109
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,924
<i>Because me and her fucked

<i>Don't say anythin'.
Hang on a minute.</i>

120
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,286
<i>- You all right?

121
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:28,644
<i>- Look, why aren't you speakin' to me?
- I am, man.</i>

122
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,205
<i>You ain't chatted to me in, like,
three weeks.</i>

123
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:33,960
<i>I've been doin'
better things, isn't?</i>

124
00:07:34,158 --> 00:07:36,677
<i>- I need to speak to you about somethin'.
- Come on, alisa.</i>

125
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:38,082
<i>Call me later, yeah?</i>

<i>Listen, hear what, right.</i>

127
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:10,662
<i>If you say anythin' to your fuckin' dad,
I'll kill you, you understand?</i>

128
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:15,774
<i>I can make things so easy for you,

129
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,383
<i>- Hi, poppet.
- Hey.</i>

130
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,202
<i>Who's that boy you were with?</i>

131
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,282
<i>I thought maybe
it was the one from before.</i>

132
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:44,771
<i>No, I fell.
He was helpin' me up.</i>

133
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,085
<i>Oh, right. Only I saw him givin' you
a peck on the cheek.</i>

134
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,411
<i>- I thought maybe it was him.
- No.</i>

135
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:56,478
<i>How was biology?</i>

to your face? Look at me.</i>

138
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,544
<i>I fell.</i>

139
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,285
<i>You all right?</i>

Why you take so long?</i>

145
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:36,374
<i>I had to chat to one girl,
isn't it?</i>

146
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:39,734
<i>This here is Andreas.</i>

147
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,051
<i>Nice to meet you, bruv.</i>

148
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:44,215
<i>- This is my nephew Trevor.
- Trife.</i>

149
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:47,894
<i>You have the thing?</i>

150
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:00,367
<i>You see...</i>

151
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,765
<i>If you don't drill
the replica good...</i>

152
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,054
<i>The bullet won't leave and pop!</i>

153
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,291
<i>Is it okay?</i>

154
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:14,029
<i>The last boy used to do this
for me, was shit.</i>

155
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,005
<i>Guns always used to blow up.</i>

156
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,375
<i>But this looks good.</i>

157
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:21,777
<i>But I will have to test it.
Sayin'?</i>

158
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:26,835
<i>So, listen, come see me
when you finish school tomorrow...</i>

159
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,006
<i>And we can discuss business,
all right?</i>

160
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,448
<i>- Cool.
- Yeah.</i>

161
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,284
<i>Now get out.</i>

162
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:42,379
<i>Me just a joke with you.</i>

163
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,951
<i>Me see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

164
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,412
<i>- Don't be late, you know.
- I won't, I won't.</i>

165
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,832
<i>- Later.
- All right, Trevor.</i>

166
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,046
<i>My little gun driller.</i>

167
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>Hi, Katie.</i>

168
00:10:57,936 --> 00:10:59,364
<i>- Hi, love.
- Hi.</i>

169
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:04,291
<i>- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.</i>

170
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,597
<i>Oh, that.
She fell over at school.</i>

171
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:08,974
<i>Christ, Arthur's really fucked up
my day.</i>

172
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:17,441
<i>Under the seat.</i>

173
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,689
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

174
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:39,111
<i>Curtis, I've forgotten the change, man.
I've left it back at my place.</i>

175
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:42,522
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll bring it round
to yours later, yeah?</i>

176
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:48,388
<i>Fuck it, I fuck, I fucked up. Look,
take it back, we'll sort it out tomorrow.</i>

177
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,299
<i>Cool. Cool.</i>

178
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:53,540
<i>You sure?</i>

179
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:55,168
<i>Go on.</i>

180
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:57,733
<i>Cool. Cheers, man.</i>

181
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,182
<i>- See you tomorrow.
- Cool, man. Cheers.</i>

182
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,028
<i>I think she's bein' bullied
at school.</i>

183
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,199
<i>- Did she say that?
- No. But...</i>

184
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,188
<i>Well, don't worry about it.
She's a bright kid, she'd tell us.</i>

185
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,557
<i>Have you seen
my address book anywhere?</i>

186
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,480
<i>Don't worry about it?
What sort of thing is that to say?</i>

187
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,715
<i>Aren't you worried about
your own daughter?</i>

188
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:19,900
<i>Have you asked her?</i>

189
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,773
<i>There you go.
She's fine.</i>

190
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,370
<i>Lenny, could you get your sister
to turn that shit off, please.</i>

191
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:15,501
<i>- It's been playin' for ages.
- Doesn't bother me.</i>

192
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:17,485
<i>Fine.</i>

193
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,559
<i>Katie! Katie!</i>

194
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,576
<i>Katie! Katie!</i>

195
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,192
<i>Katie!</i>

196
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:46,765
<i>We are number one for hip-hop
and in London.</i>

197
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:52,132
<i>And around the country, sky digital,
telewest and digital dab radio.</i>

198
00:14:52,397 --> 00:14:56,520
<i>Billy-Bob Thornton,
Angelina jolie's ex-husband...</i>

199
00:14:56,716 --> 00:15:00,195
<i>Has said that she's not
that good in bed.</i>

200
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:01,888
<i>Hey, mum, I got it, yeah.</i>

201
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,724
<i>- What go on, coz?

202
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:09,224
<i>- What's happenin', man?
- Like the trim still, man.</i>

203
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,418
<i>- Hey, what you want, though?
- Hey, come say hello to my mum, blood.</i>

204
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,687
<i>- Mornin', Jason.
- Mornin', Mrs. Hector.</i>

205
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,678
<i>I hope you two boys use this day
to remember that poor girl...</i>

206
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:21,822
<i>And not for foolishness.</i>

207
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,062
<i>- Yes, mum.
- Course, Mrs. Hector.</i>

208
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:25,507
<i>Go on.</i>

209
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:29,336
<i>That's right, blood,
do what your mum says.</i>

210
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:30,911
<i>Shut up, man.</i>

211
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:33,920
<i>Yeah, blood...
School called here this mornin'.</i>

212
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,502
<i>Told my mum the whole year
had the day off.</i>

213
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,091
<i>- This is proper sad, man.
- I know, man.</i>

214
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,349
<i>I was just about to leave my yard,
like had my uniform on and everythin'.</i>

215
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:47,427
<i>Listen, blood, Sam and 'em girls
always pickin' on her.</i>

216
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,476
<i>Yeah, but Sam
troubles us too, blood...</i>

217
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,451
<i>And we ain't committin' suicide
over it, are we?</i>

218
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,175
<i>If anyone should fuckin' die,
it's him man.</i>

219
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:56,957
<i>Can't believe someone
I pressed is dead.</i>

220
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,267
<i>So why didn't you tell me
then, man?</i>

221
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,312
<i>She asked me
not to say nothin', isn't it.</i>

222
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,240
<i>Thought people would call her
sket and thing.</i>

223
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:05,050
<i>Plus her dad caught us...
Hey, you got a zoot?</i>

224
00:16:05,218 --> 00:16:08,446
<i>No, I got a roll up, though.
Jacked it off my mum.</i>

225
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:10,367
<i>Spark that, man.</i>

226
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,264
<i>Blood, weird thing is, though...</i>

227
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,198
<i>Her dad came by late last night.</i>

228
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,081
<i>That's how I found out
she was dead.</i>

229
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:29,435
<i>In her suicide note, she said
somethin' about Sam troublin' her.</i>

230
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,246
<i>- But I was always nice to her.
- A note?</i>

231
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,093
<i>Well, did she mention me?</i>

232
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,908
<i>I never see you chat to her
anyway, man.</i>

233
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:40,315
<i>Blood, don't watch
what I do, man.</i>

234
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,453
<i>You ain't always with me, and
you never knew I pressed her either.</i>

235
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,627
<i>You come like some secret agent
or somethin', man.</i>

236
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,056
<i>Let me have two draw
of that, man.</i>

237
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:50,195
<i>Hey, listen bell moony.
I wanna duck out quick.</i>

238
00:16:51,323 --> 00:16:52,664
<i>The whole day?</i>

239
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,663
<i>Don't lie, blood.</i>

240
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:59,287
<i>Yeah, I'll have
to take a cab still.</i>

241
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:02,072
<i>Moons, just hurry up though, man.
All right, bless.</i>

242
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:06,768
<i>- Hey, blood, you see Katie, yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

243
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,422
<i>Do you reckon
she would have banged me, like?</i>

244
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:10,834
<i>No, man.</i>

245
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,470
<i>Why not?</i>

246
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,231
<i>I think I'm buff.</i>

247
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,784
<i>Blood, I beg you,
play the fuckin' game, man.</i>

248
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,481
<i>Oh, fuck's sake.</i>

249
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,523
<i>Hello?</i>

250
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,987
<i>- Yeah, who's that?
- It's me.</i>

251
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,677
<i>You didn't call me.</i>

252
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,618
<i>Did you hear?
Sad, isn't it?</i>

253
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:41,424
<i>- Look, what are you doin' today?
- Gonna jam with moons and Jay.</i>

254
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,895
<i>Might go up west end later.
Gotta check my Uncle, why?</i>

255
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:49,777
<i>- No, just tell me now, man.
- I'd rather see you.</i>

256
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,586
<i>You don't need to see me,
you ain't my girl no more. What is it?</i>

257
00:17:55,537 --> 00:17:56,945
<i>What the fuck do you mean
you're pregnant?</i>

258
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:58,320
<i>Oh, my days!</i>

259
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,262
<i>You can't be fuckin' pregnant. I thought
you'd get the mornin' after pill?</i>

260
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,699
<i>It's not just up
to the girls, you know.</i>

261
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:05,675
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

262
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,285
<i>I've been takin' tests all week.</i>

263
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:11,913
<i>Look...</i>

264
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,439
<i>I want us to get back together.</i>

265
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:17,190
<i>Later, fuck that.
After you fucked Sam a few weeks ago?</i>

266
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:19,528
<i>Yeah, he told me he bare backed you.
That's even worse man.</i>

267
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,580
<i>- You never knew I knew that, did you?
- But we do know!</i>

268
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,233
<i>Hey, and don't bother tryin'
to explain, man.</i>

269
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,163
<i>You know what,
for all I know the baby's his.</i>

270
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,146
<i>Fact now that I think of it,
I know it is, and you know it too.</i>

271
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,250
<i>Yeah, blood, she's loose, man.
Cut her off, man.</i>

272
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,687
<i>What?
I slept with Katie last year.</i>

273
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:34,155
<i>Me and you weren't even together,
so fuck off!</i>

274
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>Standard, blood. You get me. I told you
about that girl, man, she's a sket.</i>

275
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:41,376
<i>Pregnant, though.
It's a bit deep, still.</i>

276
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,221
<i>- So what you gonna do?
- I don't know, man.</i>

277
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:46,911
<i>Fuck it, it can't be mine.</i>

278
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,831
<i>I just don't need
this shit today.</i>

279
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,998
<i>So what, can man's come
and reach your Uncle with you, blood?</i>

280
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:57,059
<i>No, I think he wants
to see me alone, still.</i>

281
00:18:58,856 --> 00:19:00,284
<i>So, what did he say?</i>

282
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,593
<i>He said he's goin' out.</i>

283
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,733
<i>And that fuckin' Sam told him
we slept together.</i>

284
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,592
<i>So why didn't you tell him
what happened?</i>

285
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:09,279
<i>He didn't give me
a fuckin' chance.</i>

286
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:12,927
<i>You know what, yeah,
fuck him and this fuckin' baby.</i>

287
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,996
<i>- All right, girls?
- Mum, don't you knock?</i>

288
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,617
<i>Oi, none of your lip.</i>

289
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:21,598
<i>I know you're upset,
but that's no reason to be cheeky.</i>

290
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,900
<i>- Do you want a drink, Becky?
- No, thanks.</i>

291
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,368
<i>Right, I'm off to work.
Lis, I want you back by midnight.</i>

292
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,451
<i>- Oh, mum!
- One, then, on the dot.</i>

293
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,690
<i>And if you think you can't get back here
call your dad and he'll pick you up.</i>

294
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,861
<i>- All right?
- Okay.</i>

295
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:34,745
<i>Alis...</i>

296
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:40,728
<i>I know you're upset, but there's
nothin' you could have done.</i>

297
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:43,227
<i>Now, I'm sad for
that other girl's parents...</i>

298
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,938
<i>But all that really matters
is that you're all right.</i>

299
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,891
<i>Are you all right?</i>

300
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,485
<i>I'm...</i>

301
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,246
<i>I'm fine.</i>

302
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:59,156
<i>Good.
See you later, darlin'.</i>

303
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,714
<i>- I love you, lis.
- Love you.</i>

304
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,412
<i>Yo, d. Guess what, man,
I got the day off school.</i>

305
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,653
<i>And I'm goin' to that party
tonight as well.</i>

306
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,572
<i>Yeah, I know.
Your school belled a while ago.</i>

307
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:13,973
<i>Hi, Lenny.</i>

308
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,981
<i>I'm sorry about your sister, bro.</i>

309
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,611
<i>Tell your mate Trevor
I said thank you.</i>

310
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:22,545
<i>See you.</i>

311
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,334
<i>So, you gonna help me or what?</i>

312
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,536
<i>Yeah.</i>

313
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,944
<i>I still can't believe
Katie killed herself.</i>

314
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,180
<i>So, what do you wanna do?</i>

315
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:38,614
<i>You know what...</i>

316
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,399
<i>I wanna get fucked up.</i>

317
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,771
<i>I wanna go shoppin' for tonight,
that'll make me feel better.</i>

318
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:45,356
<i>And if trife don't want me,
I'm sure someone else will.</i>

319
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,414
<i>I meant about the baby.</i>

320
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,111
<i>Lose it, if I'm lucky.</i>

321
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:51,190
<i>Well, at least
you're thinkin' straight.</i>

322
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:53,013
<i>We've got the whole day off,
we might as well do somethin'...</i>

323
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,614
<i>Constructive with ourselves.</i>

324
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,654
<i>I know where we can score
some wicked draw.</i>

325
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,263
<i>I'd get so fat if I kept this.</i>

326
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,909
<i>Taxi!</i>

327
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,273
<i>What the fuck, man?</i>

328
00:21:16,563 --> 00:21:18,733
<i>What's fuckin' takin' him
so long, man?</i>

329
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,303
<i>Taxi!</i>

330
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,031
<i>Fuck off!</i>

331
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:26,765
<i>Fuckin' hell, man!</i>

332
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,171
<i>Come on.</i>

333
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:30,921
<i>Fuck, man.</i>

334
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,318
<i>Look at this girl's pussy. Looks like
her guts are hangin' out and shit.</i>

335
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,798
<i>Man, that's nasty, man.
I hate that shit, ugly pussy.</i>

336
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,224
<i>- Still poke it, though.
- No, that's not for me, star.</i>

337
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:46,950
<i>I won't fuck no girl, yeah,
unless she's got a dv?</i>

338
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,521
<i>Dv?</i>

339
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:51,693
<i>Designer vagina, man.
Neat tucked in lips and shit.</i>

340
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:52,871
<i>It's the way forward, blood.</i>

341
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:56,037
<i>So, who's this guy again?</i>

342
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:59,628
<i>Rupert. I met him at some rave.
He gives me weed and shit for free.</i>

343
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:01,254
<i>Is it? Safe.</i>

344
00:22:08,683 --> 00:22:09,991
<i>Finally.</i>

345
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,578
<i>Let's roll, man.</i>

346
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,965
<i>Yes, Jay, what's cookin', bruv?</i>

347
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:19,713
<i>- Yeah, like the trim, rude boy.
- Bye, mum.</i>

348
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:25,058
<i>- What took you so fuckin' long, man?
- There weren't no cabs, isn't it.</i>

349
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,887
<i>I've been havin' a good week, actually.
Come on in.</i>

350
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:38,237
<i>So, Rebecca,
who's your lovely friend?</i>

351
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,372
<i>- I'm alisa.
- Alisa? What a pretty name.</i>

352
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,654
<i>Ladies, this is my friend
Hamish.</i>

353
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:44,897
<i>Hi.</i>

354
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:48,377
<i>Go and take a seat on the sofa, take
your coats off, make yourselves at home.</i>

355
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,309
<i>How much do you want this time?</i>

356
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,474
<i>- As much as you wanna give.
- Not a problem.</i>

357
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,278
<i>But I want some e's today
and maybe some coke.</i>

358
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:04,831
<i>The weed I can do for free, but,
coke and e's is gonna cost.</i>

359
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:09,851
<i>I haven't got no money on me.</i>

360
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,897
<i>Who needs money?</i>

361
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,253
<i>- Get your knickers off then.
- In your fuckin' dreams.</i>

362
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:38,012
<i>- What, you're not gonna let me fuck you?
- No.</i>

363
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:41,339
<i>- What about a blow-job then?
- Fuck off.</i>

364
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:44,184
<i>- Wank?
- Keep talkin' and you'll get a smack.</i>

365
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:46,871
<i>Oh, come on, Al,
we'll make dollars when we sell it.</i>

366
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,213
<i>Do you wanna shop or what?</i>

367
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,289
<i>- Yeah, but...
- Stop bein' such a borin' bitch then.</i>

368
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:57,621
<i>But I'm not gonna suck it, okay?</i>

369
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,576
<i>What is that?</i>

370
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,348
<i>- How old are you?
- I'm old enough, blood.</i>

371
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,623
<i>"Blood", you're too young
to buy these beers.</i>

372
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:23,854
<i>- What? Oh, shut up, man.
- Oi, come back.</i>

373
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,532
<i>- Come back!
- Come back or what, man? Shut your mouth.</i>

374
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,316
<i>- I'll have you arrested!
- You ain't gonna do shit, man.</i>

375
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:31,413
<i>- Get out of my shop.
- What?</i>

376
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,397
<i>- You're banned!
- Man, I'll leave when I wanna leave, man.</i>

377
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:34,542
<i>What? Come.</i>

378
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:37,393
<i>- Dickhead.
- Fuck off.</i>

379
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,335
<i>Bastard!</i>

380
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:44,750
<i>I ain't fuckin' with her no more, man,
after she got banged by Sam.</i>

381
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,400
<i>Fuck that, you get me?
She's any girl to me now. Fuck her.</i>

382
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:51,051
<i>Bloods, I wouldn't care whose baby
it is, yeah, but I'd still bang that.</i>

383
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,578
<i>Hey, bloods, where's yours?</i>

384
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,337
<i>Had to dash it at that guy,
isn't it, man.</i>

385
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:58,028
<i>- He was shook, though.
- You're a bad man.</i>

386
00:24:58,225 --> 00:24:59,304
<i>Let's dust, man.</i>

387
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:01,197
<i>I ain't standin' on the corner like
a fuckin' rent boy all day.</i>

388
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:04,337
<i>- So what, which way are we goin', bruv?
- Let's roll this way, isn't it.</i>

389
00:25:08,144 --> 00:25:10,663
<i>What's wrong, man?
What are you lookin' at?</i>

390
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,774
<i>Sam lives over there.</i>

391
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,743
<i>- You wanna get your gameboy back?
- Yeah.</i>

392
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:20,686
<i>Yeah that, I'm on that, man,
let's do it. Come, come.</i>

393
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,541
<i>Let's not be stupid, man.</i>

394
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,339
<i>- So, what are we gonna do?
- Sam's gonna be at school, blood, yeah?</i>

395
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,877
<i>Only our year's got the day off.</i>

396
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,028
<i>We'll just go up there,
say we're his friends...</i>

397
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,819
<i>And we're pickin' it up,
isn't it? Simple.</i>

398
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,859
<i>Or, we ding the bell,
get through the main door...</i>

399
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,523
<i>And boot down his fuckin'
front door, isn't it.</i>

400
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:38,987
<i>No, man.
That's some police shit.</i>

401
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,426
<i>Look, blood, there's three
of us alie...</i>

402
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:42,760
<i>We'll just go up there, yeah,
ask for it back.</i>

403
00:25:42,924 --> 00:25:45,094
<i>And if he's gets brave, blood, we'll
handle it at school together, isn't it.</i>

404
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:46,688
<i>- Standard, let's roll.
- But he rolls deep, man!</i>

405
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:49,093
<i>- Hey, fuck it, man, let's do it.
- Oh, shit.</i>

406
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:01,184
<i>What the fuck is he doin' at home,
man? He's gonna kill us.</i>

407
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:04,100
<i>- Hey, don't worry, man, he's gone.
- What if he comes back, though, like?</i>

408
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,822
<i>He won't, man. What's wrong with you?
What you scared for, man?</i>

409
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,869
<i>I'm not, man.
I think we should just duck, man.</i>

410
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,926
<i>- Just shut up, man, you're scared.
- I'm not.</i>

411
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:14,300
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

412
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:17,564
<i>We're Sam's friends. We've just come
here to pick somethin' up.</i>

413
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:20,732
<i>Sam's not here.
He's just gone to the shop for me.</i>

414
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,614
<i>Yeah, we saw him downstairs, he told
us to come up and wait for him.</i>

415
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,309
<i>He just left, right?</i>

416
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,850
<i>Hey, that must be his room.</i>

417
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,666
<i>- That's where your gameboy is.
- Is that my gameboy, bloods?</i>

418
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:43,712
<i>Oh shit, shit, oh shit.</i>

419
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,595
<i>What if he comes back now?</i>

420
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,234
<i>What the fuck
are you lot doin' here?</i>

421
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:50,107
<i>Sam jacked my sister's gameboy,
yeah, I'm just here to take it back.</i>

422
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,379
<i>- Hold this boy.
- Hey, moons, hold him. Hold him, man.</i>

423
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,974
<i>He told me he bought that,
he's such an arsehole.</i>

424
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:56,351
<i>Yo, what's out there?</i>

425
00:26:56,352 --> 00:26:58,522
<i>Balcony, where he stashes
his weed and shit.</i>

426
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:00,571
<i>Come and take this boy
outside, man.</i>

427
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,205
<i>If he's such an arsehole,
why are you with him?</i>

428
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:05,180
<i>I don't know, he's older,
more mature.</i>

429
00:27:05,855 --> 00:27:07,381
<i>Then why you cheat him?</i>

430
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,293
<i>- Blood, you can't take his weed, man.
- Fuck that, man.</i>

431
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:13,654
<i>- Hey, Jay, man, we got him.
- Just give me one minute, man.</i>

432
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:17,596
<i>I don't even know
why you're with that boy, man.</i>

433
00:27:17,597 --> 00:27:19,669
<i>Look...
You could be my girlfriend.</i>

434
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,274
<i>It's just, he said if I leave him,
he'll tell everyone I was a shit fuck.</i>

435
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:28,180
<i>No, no, I know you're not shit,
I bet you're cold in bed, man.</i>

436
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,491
<i>I don't know...</i>

437
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,122
<i>He says I'm not that good
and I've only slept with him, so...</i>

438
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,658
<i>Yeah, well, let me be the judge
of that then, isn't it.</i>

439
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:34,640
<i>What?</i>

440
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:38,510
<i>- What, has he got any rubbers in here?
- Yeah, in that drawer. Why?</i>

441
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:41,743
<i>Not now, Jay, man, his mum said
he only went down the road.</i>

442
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:48,493
<i>- Maybe you lot should go.
- You know what, don't watch that, man.</i>

443
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,244
<i>Oh, no, no, no, low it, man.</i>

444
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:03,793
<i>- I'm sorry, yeah, this don't normally...
- It's okay.</i>

445
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,284
<i>It's because you're so buff,
yeah, and like you're good, man.</i>

446
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:11,636
<i>In fact, yeah, you should leave
that pussyhole and be my girlfriend.</i>

447
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:14,739
<i>- What do you think, yeah?
- What if he beats me up or somethin'?</i>

448
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,463
<i>No, he ain't gonna do that.
Look, you know what, darlin'.</i>

449
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,667
<i>- Come with me. Come.
- Are you done?</i>

450
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,037
<i>- One minute.

451
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:24,178
<i>You let the side down!</i>

452
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,194
<i>What's up, man? You don't even know
about sex live, man.</i>

453
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:28,398
<i>What the fuck you lot doin'

00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:37,543
<i>You see, yeah,

00:28:37,745 --> 00:28:41,159
<i>And you, see, you, Claire, I'm gonna
shove this bat so far up your pussy...</i>

458
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,596
<i>Shit.</i>

00:28:42,864 --> 00:28:44,587
<i>Hey, fuck you, you fuckin' prick.</i>

460
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,083
<i>- Fuckin' idiot!
- Hold on, hold on, man.</i>

461
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,520
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

462
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,623
<i>Come on, lets go.</i>

463
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,171
<i>Run, blood!</i>

00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,803
<i>I can't believe

465
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:26,408
<i>Hey, fuck him, man,

466
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,774
<i>Hey, you know

467
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,146
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

468
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,360
<i>Sam's gonna kill me.</i>

469
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:34,281
<i>He ain't gonna do shit to you, man.
You know why?</i>

470
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:35,896
<i>Because you're my girl now,
you get me?</i>

471
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,276
<i>Yeah, man, let him come, man.
You see my Uncle I'm checkin' today?</i>

472
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:41,469
<i>He's a proper bad man. And if Sam
thinks about doin' anythin'...</i>

473
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:43,261
<i>My Uncle will murk him
on the spot, standard.</i>

474
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:45,601
<i>You keep talkin' about your Uncle
that's gonna do this and that, yeah?</i>

475
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,204
<i>But we ain't even met him, man.
I mean, what...</i>

476
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:48,869
<i>Are you sure my man
even exists, like?</i>

477
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,597
<i>He comes like the invisible man
or somethin', blood.</i>

478
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:52,702
<i>- Yeah. Hollow man, rude boy.
- I'll slap you, you know that, moons?</i>

479
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,201
<i>Just wait till we need him
and he'll be here.</i>

480
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,182
<i>If he's there, I'm there. I'll jook
some up, blood. I don't business.</i>

481
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:00,261
<i>Shut up, moons man,
you ain't gonna do shit, man.</i>

482
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:04,291
<i>I can't believe you swallowed
that guy's spunk.</i>

483
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:07,106
<i>I hate it, it tastes like
salty egg whites.</i>

484
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:09,277
<i>Yuk, but what
if he's got somethin'?</i>

485
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,642
<i>You can't catch nothin' like that.
All the acids in your stomach kill it.</i>

486
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,879
<i>- Did you like wankin' that guy?
- No.</i>

487
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,567
<i>Was you wet?</i>

488
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,840
<i>- Yeah, a little bit.
- A little bit?</i>

489
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:22,238
<i>- Yeah, but his thin"s so small, man.
- I bet you was mad wet, I was.</i>

490
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:24,064
<i>Well then, why didn't you
just fuck that Rupert friend...</i>

491
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:25,465
<i>And I wouldn't have had
to wank him.</i>

492
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:28,668
<i>You just said you liked it.
Anyway only my man gets the pussy.</i>

493
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:30,969
<i>Unlike you, obviously.
You sure you know whose baby it is?</i>

494
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,340
<i>- Don't try it, Becky.
- Yeah, well, I couldn't have that in me.</i>

495
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:35,736
<i>If I was you, I'd want to rip it out
with a coat-hanger.</i>

496
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,736
<i>- Fuckin' hell, man!
- What, blood?</i>

497
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:17,304
<i>Didn't I tell 'em no onions?</i>

498
00:31:17,305 --> 00:31:19,425
<i>Yeah, you did, man,
you did say no onions, blood, man.</i>

499
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,302
<i>Didn't I say no onions?</i>

500
00:31:25,303 --> 00:31:26,415
<i>Fool.</i>

501
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:49,267
<i>- Oi, what's goin' on?
- We got money, relax yourself.</i>

502
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:50,729
<i>Drive, man.</i>

503
00:31:50,964 --> 00:31:52,525
<i>So, what, are me and you on
or what now?</i>

504
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:55,243
<i>- Yeah, yeah, I'm your girl.
- Yeah?</i>

505
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:57,839
<i>Yeah.
Come here.</i>

506
00:32:00,947 --> 00:32:03,729
<i>Well, I gotta go home.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?</i>

507
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,518
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, take care, yeah.</i>

508
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:32,492
<i>Coke head baby.</i>

509
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,980
<i>Whatever, man,
it'll be gone soon.</i>

510
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,868
<i>God, I ain't changin'
no fuckin' nappies for it.</i>

511
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,192
<i>Look, yeah, there's an abortion clinic
number here, do you wanna bell it?</i>

512
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,551
<i>Not now, man. Not today.
Look, can I use your toilet?</i>

513
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:46,538
<i>Are you gonna do a shit?
Because if you are, then, no.</i>

514
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,124
<i>That's loose, man, I don't do that
in other people's houses.</i>

515
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:52,073
<i>Well, hurry up, we need to get
the money for the garms.</i>

516
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,668
<i>Yeah, she's banged up, babes.
Yeah.</i>

517
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:39,543
<i>All right, see you soon.</i>

518
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,387
<i>- Who was that?
- My man.</i>

519
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,452
<i>- Listen, lads, where you off to?
- Oxford street, man.</i>

520
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,642
<i>Well, why don't you walk?
It's only down the road.</i>

521
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,040
<i>Because we wanted
to catch a cab, man.</i>

522
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,862
<i>Why don't you shut your mouth
and mind your own business, blood?</i>

523
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,195
<i>Well, to be honest might have
to drop you off at marble arch...</i>

524
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:02,773
<i>- Because the traffic's...
- What's wrong with you?</i>

525
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:05,437
<i>Yeah, man, yeah, trife
and 'em two little pussyholes.</i>

526
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,893
<i>Yeah, man, yeah. No, no, don't reach,
don't reach, I'm cool, yeah.</i>

527
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,006
<i>Listen I swear down, blood,
if I see 'em before you see...</i>

528
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,381
<i>I'm gonna bang 'em up.
I'm gonna bang 'em up.</i>

529
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:14,527
<i>I'm gonna bust their heads,
do you understand me?</i>

530
00:34:14,718 --> 00:34:17,479
<i>Listen, if you eye 'em, yeah if you
see 'em, you just ding me, yeah.</i>

531
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:31,579
<i>- Can we go and get somethin' to eat?
- No, I don't wanna look fat for mark.</i>

532
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,546
<i>- But I'm starvin', though.
- We'll get a pizza when we get to his.</i>

533
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:49,434
<i>- Cheers, mate.
- That's nine pound twenty, mate.</i>

534
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:52,913
<i>You know what, mate, I got passed
by five black cabs today.</i>

535
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,152
<i>- Well, that ain't my fault, mate.
- Just because I'm black.</i>

536
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,285
<i>Ain't that ironic, though, like?
Black cab don't take black man.</i>

537
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,855
<i>- So, what's your point?
- My point is that...</i>

538
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:02,677
<i>It becomes a vicious circle.</i>

539
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,877
<i>- Well, what's that mean?
- It means...</i>

540
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:08,305
<i>Come back!</i>

541
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:12,394
<i>- Come on.
- You little black bastard!</i>

542
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:46,439
<i>Now I'm hungry.</i>

543
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:49,097
<i>Why did you bring me here again?</i>

544
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:52,613
<i>We give him some dope and he gives us
money for our dresses.</i>

545
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:53,830
<i>Can we get it and go, please,
because I'm really tired...</i>

546
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:55,757
<i>Of listenin' to you two fuck.
Look...</i>

547
00:35:56,143 --> 00:35:58,793
<i>I didn't know he was gonna be so old.</i>

548
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,845
<i>He's twenty-eight. He's an actor.</i>

549
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,462
<i>That's almost twice our age.</i>

550
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,214
<i>I know, but he thinks I'm eighteen,
though, so...</i>

551
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:10,313
<i>You were good, baby.</i>

552
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,667
<i>You lot want anythin' else?</i>

553
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:15,715
<i>No.</i>

554
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,530
<i>Hang on, hang on,
I thought she was pregnant?</i>

555
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,571
<i>Yeah, she is right now,
but she's gettin' rid of it.</i>

556
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,255
<i>- Go on, lis, it's good.
- Okay.</i>

557
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:32,580
<i>So how much do you want for all this?
Three hundred?</i>

558
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:34,247
<i>Yeah.</i>

559
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:36,894
<i>All right, I'll go get it.</i>

560
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:41,629
<i>Right, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?</i>

561
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,926
<i>So, you like what you see, huh?</i>

562
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,686
<i>No.</i>

563
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:52,834
<i>So what do you
come upstairs for then?</i>

564
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,387
<i>- I wanted to see if she was all right.
- She was fuckin' great.</i>

565
00:36:56,678 --> 00:36:58,848
<i>- I bet you are as well.
- Fuck off!</i>

566
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:00,603
<i>You're sick.</i>

567
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:03,519
<i>- You know she's only fifteen?
- Yeah, of course I do.</i>

568
00:37:03,717 --> 00:37:05,538
<i>I found her student card.</i>

569
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,642
<i>She thinks
it's her little secret.</i>

570
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,648
<i>Do you know
what my little secret is?</i>

571
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,397
<i>Go on, have a guess.</i>

572
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,351
<i>I'm a fuckin' bastard.</i>

573
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:22,875
<i>You know, I've never fucked
a pregnant girl before...</i>

574
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,439
<i>But, with you,
I think I'd make the exception.</i>

575
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,258
<i>How about you fuck yourself?</i>

576
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,847
<i>You should take the chance
while you can, you little slag.</i>

577
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:33,179
<i>- What did you just call me?
- I called you a fuckin' little slag...</i>

578
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:35,903
<i>Because you're fifteen years old
and you're pregnant.</i>

579
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:38,270
<i>Probably some little black fellow
who hasn't hung around.</i>

580
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,222
<i>But that's cool,
because I like you.</i>

581
00:37:45,023 --> 00:37:46,910
<i>So when you've decided
to dump it...</i>

582
00:37:47,582 --> 00:37:49,491
<i>Why don't you come back
and see me?</i>

583
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:51,389
<i>You won't have to get jealous of me
fuckin' your mate...</i>

584
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,277
<i>Because I'll probably
fuck you too.</i>

585
00:37:56,925 --> 00:37:57,939
<i>You know...</i>

586
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:00,922
<i>- You're not right about everythin'.
- What's that, then?</i>

587
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,512
<i>You're not a bastard...</i>

588
00:38:06,843 --> 00:38:08,086
<i>You're a cunt.</i>

589
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:15,280
<i>Right, ready for round two, baby?</i>

590
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:34,096
<i>Boy! This shop is heavy.</i>

591
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,940
<i>Good afternoon, sirs.
Can I help you?</i>

592
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:40,370
<i>- Yeah. Where are your hats, rude girl?
- Downstairs, sir.</i>

593
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:49,776
<i>- It's here?
- It's over there.</i>

594
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:51,858
<i>This is what you want, isn't?</i>

595
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:54,578
<i>What do you think?</i>

596
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:02,799
<i>You know what,
blood fuck that guard, man.</i>

597
00:39:03,027 --> 00:39:03,954
<i>You know what,
can we kick, man?</i>

598
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,116
<i>I'm sure they've got better stuff
down the road anyway.</i>

599
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:19,561
<i>Hey!</i>

600
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,230
<i>Wait.</i>

601
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:24,649
<i>Come on, come on.
Come with me. Come on.</i>

602
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,593
<i>Get the fuck off me, man!
What you doin'?</i>

603
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,166
<i>- You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
- For what?</i>

604
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,752
<i>- Stealin' that hat.
- I had it on when I come in, man.</i>

605
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:34,797
<i>- What's he taken?
- The cap.</i>

606
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,429
<i>He had it on
when we came in, bro.</i>

607
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,190
<i>Hey, pipe down, please.
And I'm not your bro.</i>

608
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:40,140
<i>Oi, fuck off, blood, about pipe down.
Get off me, man!</i>

609
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:41,798
<i>Listen, I told you,
I fuckin' had that when I come in.</i>

610
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,719
<i>- Don't swear at me.
- And what the fuck you gonna do?</i>

611
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,260
<i>You better watch it,
the police have been called.</i>

612
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:46,862
<i>Hey, call 'em, man.
I don't give a fuck.</i>

613
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:48,395
<i>I'll tell 'em, too.
I had the hat when I come in.</i>

614
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:49,323
<i>Hey, check your cameras, man.</i>

615
00:39:49,324 --> 00:39:50,859
<i>Nisha, would you call
the police, please.</i>

616
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,510
<i>This young man has taken this hat
and is now causin' a commotion.</i>

617
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,463
<i>- Is that all he's taken?
- Yeah.</i>

618
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:57,697
<i>But he was wearin' that cap
when he came in.</i>

619
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:59,914
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes, because I greeted him.</i>

620
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:01,059
<i>Thank you!</i>

621
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:03,265
<i>- I'm not sure that he was.
- I am sure. Sorry.</i>

622
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,701
<i>Move out the fuckin' way
and let us out, man! Yo, blood.</i>

623
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,898
<i>- Are you gonna fuckin' apologise, coz?
- Just leave, please.</i>

624
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,698
<i>- Hey, hold up, man.
- What?</i>

625
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:17,955
<i>Do you know what?
You want your hat so much, take it.</i>

626
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,284
<i>Fuckin' prick!</i>

627
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:28,322
<i>I'm stingin'. Were you watchin'?
I bet you could hear, isn't it?</i>

628
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,991
<i>So, three hundred squids, yeah, babes.
We'll split it down the mids.</i>

629
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:35,550
<i>You got shoes, right?
We can't be lookin' like no tramps.</i>

630
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:36,388
<i>Yeah.</i>

631
00:40:36,389 --> 00:40:38,276
<i>You are lookin' forward
to tonight, yeah?</i>

632
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:39,651
<i>I don't know, yeah, probably.</i>

633
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,539
<i>What's the matter, then?
You look like someone just...</i>

634
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:45,408
<i>Exactly. Look,
I've been thinkin' about stuff.</i>

635
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,599
<i>Me like this,
Katie killin' herself.</i>

636
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,928
<i>I mean, that is why
we got the day off.</i>

637
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:54,019
<i>I don't know, maybe
we shouldn't go to the party.</i>

638
00:40:54,146 --> 00:40:55,201
<i>What?</i>

639
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,496
<i>I don't know.
It's like, it's weird. It's strange.</i>

640
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,299
<i>She was so tall and pretty...
I wish I was that tall.</i>

641
00:41:04,225 --> 00:41:06,744
<i>You know, I reckon
she could have been a model.</i>

642
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,055
<i>I knew she was troubled, but...</i>

643
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:11,679
<i>I never thought it was that bad
that she'd have to kill herself.</i>

644
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,752
<i>Well, it's done now.
Nothin' we can do.</i>

645
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:17,076
<i>- I could have stuck up for her.
- So why didn't you?</i>

646
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,141
<i>I don't know.</i>

647
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,861
<i>Well, she's dead now.
Get over it. I am.</i>

648
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:23,581
<i>Don't you ever think about anythin'
but yourself?</i>

649
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:26,331
<i>Yeah.
Clothes, shoes, money, sex.</i>

650
00:41:26,558 --> 00:41:28,859
<i>Wait, sex involves me
though, don't it?</i>

651
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:31,538
<i>Do you think moony likes me?</i>

652
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,562
<i>- I don't know.
- He's so fine.</i>

653
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:35,708
<i>I won't fuck him
unless he eats me out.</i>

654
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,107
<i>- Do you think he will?
- I don't know.</i>

655
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:39,700
<i>So when you gonna get rid
of this baby?</i>

656
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,806
<i>- Lis?
- Just leave it, Becky, yeah?</i>

657
00:41:50,298 --> 00:41:53,712
<i>Saint Martin girls.
What you lot sayin'?</i>

658
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:56,846
<i>Oi, do you hear about that big bird
girl that committed suicide?</i>

659
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:58,193
<i>Proper sensitive, isn't it?</i>

660
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:01,521
<i>She got so upset.
We was only jokin' with her.</i>

661
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,671
<i>- Didn't look like a joke.
- Lis, shush.</i>

662
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:07,092
<i>She just got a bit feisty, that's all.
She needed a little bit of slappin'.</i>

663
00:42:07,288 --> 00:42:10,636
<i>But we was only playin' with her.
We never meant her to slit her wrists.</i>

664
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:14,380
<i>- She hung herself.
- Whatever. She's dead.</i>

665
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:18,386
<i>- Because of you.
- What?</i>

666
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,340
<i>She killed herself because you
and your friends bullied her...</i>

667
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,834
<i>Till she couldn't take it
no more.</i>

668
00:42:22,261 --> 00:42:24,116
<i>- You killed her.
- Shut up, you sket.</i>

669
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:25,517
<i>- You killed her.
- Fuckin' shut up.</i>

670
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:26,548
<i>You killed her.</i>

671
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:29,414
<i>Listen, right, if you don't fuckin'
shut up, you're gonna join her.</i>

672
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:32,228
<i>Look she don't mean it, yeah. Please,
don't beat us up. She's pregnant.</i>

673
00:42:33,556 --> 00:42:35,497
<i>You're that girl
that Sam fucked.</i>

674
00:42:35,699 --> 00:42:38,218
<i>Wait till I tell everyone
about this ho.</i>

675
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:39,602
<i>You know what?
Yeah, tell 'em.</i>

676
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:42,352
<i>Tell 'em alisa's pregnant
and she's keepin' the fuckin' baby.</i>

677
00:42:42,706 --> 00:42:45,039
<i>- What?
- I ain't scared of you.</i>

678
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,532
<i>If you're gonna do somethin'
to me, then do it.</i>

679
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:50,920
<i>Go on.</i>

680
00:42:51,856 --> 00:42:54,757
<i>I got bigger things to worry about
than what you can do to me.</i>

681
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:09,290
<i>What's the matter?</i>

682
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:13,543
<i>- You should bang her up, star.
- I should, shouldn't I?</i>

683
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:19,243
<i>What the fuck were you thinkin',
alisa? They could have beat us up.</i>

684
00:43:19,436 --> 00:43:20,962
<i>- So?
- You're so selfish.</i>

685
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:23,585
<i>What if my face got scarred
or somethin'?</i>

686
00:43:23,788 --> 00:43:25,675
<i>And what the fuck are you talkin' about
"keepin' the baby"?</i>

687
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,699
<i>You're not gonna have
an abortion now?</i>

688
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,765
<i>- Just leave it, Becky.
- So, what, are you like pro-life now?</i>

689
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:32,101
<i>No, but a girl we both
knew just died...</i>

690
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:34,120
<i>And I didn't do anythin'
to stop it.</i>

691
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:37,065
<i>- But I can do somethin' about this.
- So, okay...</i>

692
00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:38,337
<i>What about school?</i>

693
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,457
<i>What if you'd have got raped?
Would you have an abortion then?</i>

694
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:43,009
<i>- I don't know. Yeah, probably.
- You have to get rid of it.</i>

695
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,601
<i>- Who's gonna help you?
- I don't need any help.</i>

696
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:51,073
<i>- You all right?
- Yeah, it's mornin' sickness.</i>

697
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:55,236
<i>- It's not mornin' though.
- Look, I need to speak to trife.</i>

698
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:58,976
<i>Let's go and buy our garms.
And then we'll find him, okay? Come on.</i>

699
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,139
<i>Curtis lives up there.</i>

700
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:12,161
<i>- What, is that it?
- I think so.</i>

701
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,684
<i>You think so?</i>

702
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:17,727
<i>You think...
You think so?</i>

703
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,328
<i>Do you think I've got time
for what people think now, del?</i>

704
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:24,733
<i>- Is this the place, bro?
- Yes, it's the place.</i>

705
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:27,615
<i>But you gotta do this
on your own, bruv.</i>

706
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,729
<i>I'll wait for you back at mine.</i>

707
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:33,084
<i>- You're gonna go now, is it?
- I can't be seen here, man.</i>

708
00:44:39,616 --> 00:44:41,077
<i>What would you do, man?</i>

709
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:42,774
<i>What would you do, man?</i>

710
00:44:58,045 --> 00:45:00,794
<i>- That was a forty five pound hat, bloods.
- So?</i>

711
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:03,058
<i>You could've give it to me
for tonight, like.</i>

712
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,877
<i>Blood, it wouldn't have fit
your big African head anyway, man.</i>

713
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:07,960
<i>Oh my days!</i>

714
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:11,323
<i>You man, you man, you man,
check that gash over there, blood.</i>

715
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:14,389
<i>- Shit, check the back of, rude boy.
- She's bathin' as well, you know.</i>

716
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,306
<i>See, that's what I want, blood.
I want a rich bitch like that.</i>

717
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:19,408
<i>Yeah, so, so what, who's on it?
Me, yeah?</i>

718
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:21,620
<i>No, blood, that's me, man.
I saw her first, isn't it?</i>

719
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,118
<i>My size.</i>

720
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,520
<i>My size.
Hey, darlin', I'm...</i>

721
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,463
<i>Hey, girl,
I'm talkin' to you, man.</i>

722
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,646
<i>I'm chattin' to you!</i>

723
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,510
<i>I don't think she's on it.</i>

724
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:37,616
<i>Blood, can't chat to a girl
like that, man.</i>

725
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:39,408
<i>You think you're nang, blood? Why
don't you show him how to do it, then?</i>

726
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,132
<i>Fuck it.
Let's duck, man.</i>

727
00:45:41,528 --> 00:45:44,626
<i>He don't wanna check for that
because he's still on alisa, isn't it?</i>

728
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:48,372
<i>Man, I'll show you now
I can chat to that girl, man.</i>

729
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,251
<i>Go on then.</i>

730
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:56,586
<i>- Why is he always on our hype, man?
- He thinks he's big, man.</i>

731
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,627
<i>- Hey, can I help you?
- Do you work here?</i>

732
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,737
<i>No, sorry,
just makin' conversation.</i>

733
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,682
<i>I wouldn't buy
these trainers, though.</i>

734
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:07,628
<i>- Seriously, I wouldn't.
- Why not?</i>

735
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,458
<i>Well, the front always comes off.</i>

736
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:11,727
<i>Plus, those are the old ones.
New ones are upstairs.</i>

737
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,597
<i>Trevor.</i>

738
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:18,958
<i>Stella.</i>

739
00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:27,660
<i>- Want a zoot, blood?
- Yeah. Come, we get out of here, man.</i>

740
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:30,127
<i>You know I could have got
the number though, isn't it?</i>

741
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:31,982
<i>- So could I, blood.
- I don't think so, blood.</i>

742
00:46:32,783 --> 00:46:35,237
<i>You look smart...
What do you do?</i>

743
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:38,853
<i>Smart. That's a new one.
What... like smartly dressed?</i>

744
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,704
<i>- No, clever, intelligent.
- Thank you.</i>

745
00:46:43,822 --> 00:46:45,032
<i>I'm an architect.</i>

746
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:47,948
<i>Rings? You married?</i>

747
00:46:49,293 --> 00:46:50,699
<i>Yeah, my...</i>

748
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,129
<i>Husband's been away
a while.</i>

749
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:55,906
<i>If I was your husband,
I'd never leave you.</i>

750
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:58,114
<i>And I don't need Viagra,
you know.</i>

751
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,427
<i>Thank you...</i>

752
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:01,825
<i>That's useful to know.</i>

753
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,185
<i>Don't you get lonely
by yourself?</i>

754
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:07,555
<i>Yeah.</i>

755
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:09,991
<i>Yeah. I do.</i>

756
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:14,273
<i>Actually, sometimes I could use
a bit of company.</i>

757
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:16,871
<i>- I'd keep you company.
- I bet you would.</i>

758
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:23,589
<i>- How old are you?
- How old are you?</i>

759
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:25,629
<i>Twenty-six. You?</i>

760
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:28,644
<i>- I'm twenty-three.
- You're not twenty-three.</i>

761
00:47:28,903 --> 00:47:30,942
<i>All right, I'm twenty-two,
but I'm mature, man.</i>

762
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:33,695
<i>- Twenty-two? Really?
- All right, I'm twenty, I swear.</i>

763
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:37,061
<i>It's not like I'm tryin' it on
or anythin'.</i>

764
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,305
<i>Good.</i>

765
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:42,271
<i>Because I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.</i>

766
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,162
<i>My girl puts onion in my burger.</i>

767
00:47:56,163 --> 00:47:57,634
<i>But, blood, man, you shouldn't have
thrown it, though, isn't it?</i>

768
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:58,849
<i>She didn't do what I asked.</i>

769
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,098
<i>You should have gave
the burger to me, blood, man.</i>

770
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:03,927
<i>- Man, I don't like onions.
- Hey, what happened, man?</i>

771
00:48:04,162 --> 00:48:06,843
<i>She's a cock tease, man. She's on it,
and then she ducked, isn't it?</i>

772
00:48:06,978 --> 00:48:09,497
<i>That's a bit weird. White girls
usually fuck you for a browns.</i>

773
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:11,679
<i>- I knew you wouldn't get that, rude boy.
- Standard.</i>

774
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,876
<i>Shut up, man. I'm still gonna bang
that when I go see her.</i>

775
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,991
<i>How are you gonna bang her, blood
and go see her when she kicked out.</i>

776
00:48:16,992 --> 00:48:19,006
<i>Are you stupid or somethin'?</i>

777
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:20,054
<i>No.</i>

778
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:21,927
<i>I got this,
and I'm gonna bring it to her.</i>

779
00:48:22,111 --> 00:48:22,910
<i>Hey, blood, hold him,
hold him, hold him.</i>

780
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:24,830
<i>Jay, I beg you, pass it back, man.
Hey, moons, moons, moons. Hey, Jay.</i>

781
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,765
<i>Blood, she got plenty dollars in here,
you know. And she's a...</i>

782
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:32,667
<i>Boy! What the fuck are you doin', man?
Where are you goin'?</i>

783
00:48:32,894 --> 00:48:34,524
<i>- Leave it. Leave it out, he's a youth.
- Or what, coz?</i>

784
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:37,044
<i>Or else I'll bust you in your head
you fuckin' white pussyhole!</i>

785
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,709
<i>What? Blood, you think because
I'm white, I won't knock you out?</i>

786
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:40,249
<i>Is that right, blood?
Yo, let me take my hat off.</i>

787
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:41,784
<i>How about white boy,
skinhead nutter, mate?</i>

788
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:43,702
<i>Does that work better for you,
dickhead?</i>

789
00:48:46,395 --> 00:48:47,572
<i>Oi.</i>

790
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,992
<i>- Shit.
- That's really good though, cousin.</i>

791
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,671
<i>What, man,
you think that scares me?</i>

792
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:01,709
<i>Man, you don't even know me.</i>

793
00:49:03,129 --> 00:49:04,754
<i>Low it low it, come on, come on.</i>

794
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,122
<i>Just get out of here, man.
You men got murked, like.</i>

795
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:14,261
<i>- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- What are you talkin' about?</i>

796
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,974
<i>You! Startin' fights
in the middle of the street, man.</i>

797
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:18,102
<i>I was backin' you up, blood.</i>

798
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,704
<i>That's not what
I'm talkin' about, blood.</i>

799
00:49:19,767 --> 00:49:21,522
<i>If we plan somethin' together,
that's cool.</i>

800
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:23,221
<i>But that was under control
until you started, man.</i>

801
00:49:23,222 --> 00:49:24,917
<i>You can't just start arms house
in the middle of the street.</i>

802
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:26,837
<i>- What's wrong with you, blood?
- Just cool it, Jay, man.</i>

803
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,756
<i>All right, man.
So where's the purse?</i>

804
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,357
<i>Wait, blood. I told you, yeah,
I want the fuckin' cards, isn't it.</i>

805
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:32,979
<i>No, man, who fuckin' took it?
Give me the purse!</i>

806
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,092
<i>Blood, man, you want,
you want the cards, yeah?</i>

807
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:35,535
<i>- Yes, I want the fuckin' cards.
- You want the cards.</i>

808
00:49:35,732 --> 00:49:37,258
<i>- Hey, moons. Moons.
- Hey, blood, don't fuck about.</i>

809
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:39,244
<i>So what, you can share
your girl with Sam...</i>

810
00:49:39,316 --> 00:49:40,339
<i>And you can't even share
the purse with us, blood.</i>

811
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,900
<i>You fuckin' prick.</i>

812
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:45,042
<i>- Get the fuck off me!
- Fuck is wrong with you, blood?</i>

813
00:49:45,202 --> 00:49:46,663
<i>We're gonna split that or not?
All right, that's what it's got to?</i>

814
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:50,247
<i>You know what, take your fuckin'
purse, you like it so much.</i>

815
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:51,691
<i>You're a dickhead, man.</i>

816
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:53,517
<i>Hey, blood,
don't take it out on us...</i>

817
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:55,663
<i>Because your girl
got pressed by next man.</i>

818
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:57,680
<i>If you was somebody else, I would have
stabbed your claret, rude boy!</i>

819
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,200
<i>Stab me then, blood!
My Uncle'll kill you!</i>

820
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,017
<i>You and your fuckin' Uncle, man!
If my man's even real.</i>

821
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:05,636
<i>You know what, blood, if he is real,
yeah, you better go to him, isn't it?</i>

822
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,296
<i>Because, blood, you ain't got no-one
no more, man. You ain't got alisa.</i>

823
00:50:08,495 --> 00:50:10,021
<i>You ain't got that sket no more.</i>

824
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:12,905
<i>And we ain't backin' you no more.
Come, moons, man.</i>

825
00:50:13,102 --> 00:50:17,062
<i>Hey, who the fuck you chattin' to, man?
Without me, you two ain't shit!</i>

826
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:19,083
<i>And alisa, I can have her if I want,
but I don't need her.</i>

827
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:21,005
<i>I don't need pussyhole friends
like you, either.</i>

828
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:22,761
<i>Yeah, you keep tellin'
yourself that, blood.</i>

829
00:50:22,957 --> 00:50:26,475
<i>Remember, we might call you trife
but your name's Trevor.</i>

830
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:28,744
<i>- Remember that, blood.
- Come, we jet, blood.</i>

831
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,705
<i>Claire, honey,
Sam's here to see you.</i>

832
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:04,962
<i>Thanks, Mrs. Parkinson.</i>

833
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:07,228
<i>I'll leave you kids to it.</i>

834
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:14,244
<i>- Where are they?
- Who?</i>

835
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:17,757
<i>Don't try to boy me off,
'em three little pussyholes.</i>

836
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:19,101
<i>I don't know.</i>

837
00:51:20,132 --> 00:51:22,236
<i>I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.</i>

838
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:24,224
<i>- Where are they?
- I don't know.</i>

839
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:25,596
<i>Jeez.</i>

840
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:29,538
<i>Listen, yeah.
My mum nearly broke her arm.</i>

841
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:31,807
<i>You better start talkin',
or I'm gonna bang you up, you hear me?</i>

842
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:35,384
<i>When we get to school, I'm gonna tell
everyone what a rubbish fuck you are.</i>

843
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:38,367
<i>And how bad you smell.
If you know what I'm sayin'.</i>

844
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:41,113
<i>Please, don't, I really don't know
where they are.</i>

845
00:51:41,313 --> 00:51:44,345
<i>All I know is that they're goin' to
that party tonight.</i>

846
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,292
<i>That's where they're gonna be.</i>

847
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:50,741
<i>So why weren't I invited?</i>

848
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,497
<i>Because no-one
that's goin' likes you.</i>

849
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,193
<i>Sam, stop, please.
I'm sorry.</i>

850
00:52:00,094 --> 00:52:00,759
<i>Claire?</i>

851
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,941
<i>Claire, baby, are you all right?</i>

852
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,074
<i>Yeah, mum, I'm fine.</i>

853
00:52:07,069 --> 00:52:09,457
<i>Me and Sam are just talkin'.</i>

854
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:10,260
<i>Okay.</i>

855
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:12,859
<i>Use a condom,
sweetheart.</i>

856
00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:15,996
<i>That brings me
to my next question.</i>

857
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:18,425
<i>Whose girl are you?</i>

858
00:52:18,779 --> 00:52:20,659
<i>Because I don't even know
why I bother with you.</i>

859
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:24,506
<i>You're ugly, you're a shit fuck, and
you're with me, like sixth-form top boy.</i>

860
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,376
<i>If it weren't for me,
who would even look at you?</i>

861
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,787
<i>I don't know.</i>

862
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:33,113
<i>- Why did you sleep with alisa?
- Why'd you fuck that fuckin' Jay?</i>

863
00:52:33,114 --> 00:52:35,023
<i>In my drum as well!</i>

864
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,074
<i>I don't know. I'm sorry.</i>

865
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,565
<i>It's all right, it's all right.</i>

866
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:44,276
<i>It's just... I do everythin' you want,
whenever you want me to.</i>

867
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:47,819
<i>So why are you mean to me
and all that? I don't understand.</i>

868
00:52:50,743 --> 00:52:52,019
<i>Come here.</i>

869
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:26,668
<i>Okay, so Plaza, yeah?
In an hour.</i>

870
00:53:26,897 --> 00:53:28,969
<i>- All right, then. Bye.
- Right, see you then. Bye.</i>

871
00:53:34,736 --> 00:53:36,197
<i>Come fuck on, man.</i>

872
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,993
<i>Look, what you need is
some retail therapy, yeah?</i>

873
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:45,069
<i>Alisa says to meet her in the cafe thing
downstairs in one hour.</i>

874
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:47,214
<i>What, did you tell her
that trife ain't here?</i>

875
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:48,163
<i>No.</i>

876
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:49,421
<i>Are you a fool or somethin',
blood?</i>

877
00:53:49,422 --> 00:53:51,597
<i>You don't think she really wants
to chat to you, do you?</i>

878
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:52,612
<i>I don't know.</i>

879
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:55,628
<i>You know, fuck it isn't it, I'll tell her,
I'll give her a piece of my mind, man.</i>

880
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:56,556
<i>You get me?</i>

881
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:03,969
<i>Oh my God, that dress looks dark
on you. Is that the one you want?</i>

882
00:54:04,172 --> 00:54:05,513
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

883
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,649
<i>Well, I got all these.
I can't make my mind up.</i>

884
00:54:07,884 --> 00:54:09,258
<i>We are gonna be the hottest girls
there tonight.</i>

885
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:11,516
<i>Everyone else is gonna look like
tramps compared to us.</i>

886
00:54:11,595 --> 00:54:14,313
<i>Hi, madam, can I help?
Is that the dress you like?</i>

887
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:15,655
<i>- Yeah.
- It looks great on you.</i>

888
00:54:15,882 --> 00:54:18,377
<i>Well, if you pull your
hair back like this...</i>

889
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:20,482
<i>It will accentuate
your fabulous figure.</i>

890
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,565
<i>- Thank you.
- Nice figure?</i>

891
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:24,359
<i>Not for long.
She's knocked up.</i>

892
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,879
<i>Congratulations.
My wife is pregnant.</i>

893
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:30,118
<i>- Wife? I thought you were a batty man.
- Excuse me?</i>

894
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,000
<i>- Ain't you gay?
- No.</i>

895
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:34,552
<i>- There's nothin' wrong with it.
- I know, I'm just sayin'.</i>

896
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,541
<i>- All right, calm down, yankee.
- I'm Canadian.</i>

897
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:38,913
<i>- Same thing.
- Excuse me, how much is this one?</i>

898
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:41,537
<i>This one is a hundred
and thirty pounds.</i>

899
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,158
<i>Becks?</i>

900
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,173
<i>Well, I want this one.
How much is it?</i>

901
00:54:58,532 --> 00:55:00,636
<i>This one is two hundred
and ten pounds.</i>

902
00:55:01,603 --> 00:55:04,569
<i>Lis, can you not find another one?
I really want this one.</i>

903
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:07,072
<i>- We've got three hundred between us.
- Yeah, and you said you'd split it.</i>

904
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:08,891
<i>Look, who got the money?</i>

905
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,806
<i>I'm doin' you a favour
in the first place by gettin' you one.</i>

906
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:13,824
<i>Come on, soon you'll have
a big fat belly anyway.</i>

907
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:15,253
<i>You won't be able to wear it.</i>

908
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:18,270
<i>You've still got ninety quid.
I'm sure you can get somethin' nice.</i>

909
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:19,360
<i>Don't worry, honey.</i>

910
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,848
<i>I'll find you somethin' to make
you look even more fabulous.</i>

911
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,012
<i>- Trevor?
- Yeah.</i>

912
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,056
<i>He'll be with you in a sec.</i>

913
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:42,836
<i>You're a handsome one,
aren't you?</i>

914
00:56:58,801 --> 00:56:59,913
<i>Trevor.</i>

915
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,566
<i>- What happen?
- You told me to reach.</i>

916
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:06,157
<i>Debbie look after you?</i>

917
00:57:06,896 --> 00:57:07,943
<i>Yeah.</i>

918
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:14,343
<i>Come.</i>

919
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:17,929
<i>Me like the work you did
on that thing.</i>

920
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:21,732
<i>This...</i>

921
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:24,427
<i>Is for you.</i>

922
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:29,483
<i>See, I told you I would, man.</i>

923
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:30,827
<i>If you want me to do
anythin' else, I'm...</i>

924
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:32,802
<i>Just cool yourself, man.</i>

925
00:57:41,163 --> 00:57:42,624
<i>What's that?</i>

926
00:57:43,595 --> 00:57:44,936
<i>Heroin.</i>

927
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:49,123
<i>- You want some?
- I'm cool, man.</i>

928
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,330
<i>Go on...</i>

929
00:57:53,194 --> 00:57:54,470
<i>Take some.</i>

930
00:58:07,303 --> 00:58:08,960
<i>You grow fast, man.</i>

931
00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:11,746
<i>Anyway...</i>

932
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:14,946
<i>Me like the work
you did on the gun.</i>

933
00:58:15,014 --> 00:58:17,501
<i>- It's easy, I can...
- Don't speak, just listen.</i>

934
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:23,034
<i>You know...</i>

935
00:58:24,037 --> 00:58:26,851
<i>All you need in this world
is money...</i>

936
00:58:27,588 --> 00:58:30,903
<i>And if you know how to get it,
you laughin'.</i>

937
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,465
<i>- You seen that nice TV in my front room?
- Yeah.</i>

938
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:38,236
<i>You got one? No? But you'd like one,
of course you would.</i>

939
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:41,047
<i>Curtis, I've got Keith
on the phone. He wants you to...</i>

940
00:58:41,282 --> 00:58:43,420
<i>Tell him that I talk to my nephew.
Tell him wait.</i>

941
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,886
<i>But he's already on the phone.
He says he's...</i>

942
00:58:46,465 --> 00:58:48,352
<i>Me said tell him wait.</i>

943
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:57,972
<i>Anyway...</i>

944
00:59:00,863 --> 00:59:05,270
<i>Why you don't come work for,
with me?</i>

945
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,402
<i>Trust me, I want to, man.
Fuckin' had enough of everythin' else.</i>

946
00:59:11,454 --> 00:59:14,300
<i>- So, what do you want me to do?
- Just a few little things.</i>

947
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:16,434
<i>That sounds like somethin'
you can do?</i>

948
00:59:17,149 --> 00:59:19,417
<i>Sounds live, man.
I'm there.</i>

949
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:21,302
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

950
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:24,248
<i>Me did sell the last
of the bad guns to some youth.</i>

951
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,281
<i>Me have more of the replicas
for you to drill in the back.</i>

952
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:28,857
<i>In the meantime...</i>

953
00:59:31,355 --> 00:59:35,151
<i>You did so well with this one
that me think you should have it.</i>

954
00:59:57,879 --> 00:59:59,471
<i>- So where is he?
- I told you.</i>

955
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:02,805
<i>When he switched, yeah,
we just kicked out and left him, man.</i>

956
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:05,462
<i>And don't bother tryin' to call him,
because his phone's off.</i>

957
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:06,925
<i>Look, I really need
to speak to him.</i>

958
01:00:06,997 --> 01:00:08,371
<i>Listen up, everybody.</i>

959
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:10,701
<i>Me say listen up.</i>

960
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:15,113
<i>This is my nephew Trevor.</i>

961
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:19,336
<i>Real family member that will be joinin'
our family from now on...</i>

962
01:00:19,507 --> 01:00:22,256
<i>So, treat him nice.</i>

963
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:23,757
<i>What goin' on, bro?</i>

964
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:30,061
<i>What's up with this baby shit, man?
Is this true or somethin'?</i>

965
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,231
<i>Of course it's true.
Who's gonna lie about bein' pregnant?</i>

966
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:34,767
<i>- Nuff people, man.
- Well, I'm not lyin'.</i>

967
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:36,112
<i>All you do is lie.</i>

968
01:00:36,113 --> 01:00:38,255
<i>And now you've been caught out, you're
tryin' to drag trife back into this.</i>

969
01:00:38,256 --> 01:00:39,684
<i>Try and fuck up his life,
isn't it?</i>

970
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:41,611
<i>Look, I think I should be speakin'
to him about this, not you.</i>

971
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:43,269
<i>You are talkin' to me.</i>

972
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:45,162
<i>And what exactly
are you gonna say to him?</i>

973
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:47,913
<i>"I'm sorry, trife I fucked another guy
while I was with you."</i>

974
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:49,774
<i>Because it don't matter
because he knows now.</i>

975
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:51,181
<i>I'm gonna tell him the truth.</i>

976
01:00:53,806 --> 01:00:55,147
<i>Listen, Trevor.</i>

977
01:00:56,589 --> 01:00:59,174
<i>Come, I want you to handle
somethin' for me.</i>

978
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:06,566
<i>You're bad, isn't it?</i>

979
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,513
<i>You behave yourselves, yeah?</i>

980
01:01:18,539 --> 01:01:19,967
<i>Anythin'?</i>

981
01:01:20,618 --> 01:01:24,414
<i>You see, this is the reason
me want you to come work for me.</i>

982
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,664
<i>- Curtis.
- Shut up!</i>

983
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:28,998
<i>You see this fucker?</i>

984
01:01:29,193 --> 01:01:31,942
<i>Him take my property,
but my money never come back.</i>

985
01:01:34,888 --> 01:01:37,189
<i>Where the fuck is my money,
nigger?</i>

986
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,268
<i>I can get it for you, man.</i>

987
01:01:40,007 --> 01:01:43,013
<i>It's at my place. I told you
I was gonna bring it round later today.</i>

988
01:01:43,014 --> 01:01:44,420
<i>Hey, shut your mouth, blood.</i>

989
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:46,948
<i>If he wanted it when you decided to
bring it and not when he asked for it...</i>

990
01:01:47,143 --> 01:01:49,859
<i>You wouldn't be tied
to a fuckin' table, would you?</i>

991
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:56,795
<i>What are you waitin' for?</i>

992
01:02:00,837 --> 01:02:03,389
<i>I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry.</i>

993
01:02:03,588 --> 01:02:04,962
<i>You know what, boy?</i>

994
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,552
<i>I want you
to get my money today.</i>

995
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:09,023
<i>- I will.
- But before you go...</i>

996
01:02:09,283 --> 01:02:12,730
<i>I'm gonna make sure you remember
that you don't fuck with Curtis.</i>

997
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,384
<i>Trevor...</i>

998
01:02:22,593 --> 01:02:25,941
<i>I want you to carve a c from the corner
of him eye to the corner of him mouth.</i>

999
01:02:28,864 --> 01:02:30,238
<i>- Me?
- Yes...</i>

1000
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,640
<i>You.</i>

1001
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:42,485
<i>I want you
to carve a blood clotline...</i>

1002
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,557
<i>From here to here.</i>

1003
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:50,067
<i>Carve the fuckin' line.</i>

1004
01:02:56,923 --> 01:02:58,897
<i>No, let him.</i>

1005
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:00,881
<i>Cut him.</i>

1006
01:03:01,499 --> 01:03:02,447
<i>Man.</i>

1007
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:04,913
<i>Man, please!</i>

1008
01:03:05,274 --> 01:03:06,386
<i>Please!</i>

1009
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:10,481
<i>No.</i>

1010
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:18,549
<i>No!</i>

1011
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,058
<i>Good.</i>

1012
01:03:46,677 --> 01:03:48,498
<i>Trevor... come.</i>

1013
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,317
<i>Come here.</i>

1014
01:03:51,476 --> 01:03:51,977
<i>Trevor!</i>

1015
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:03,949
<i>Please.</i>

1016
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:24,013
<i>The best thing you
could do right now is fuck off...</i>

1017
01:04:24,014 --> 01:04:25,835
<i>And get an abortion of Sam's baby.</i>

1018
01:04:25,998 --> 01:04:28,318
<i>Because he don't want you,
and trife don't want you either.</i>

1019
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:30,085
<i>What, has he said that?</i>

1020
01:04:30,285 --> 01:04:33,284
<i>- Who wants a sket like you?
- Has he told you he don't want me.</i>

1021
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:35,721
<i>Yeah.
Now fuck off, isn't it.</i>

1022
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,208
<i>What's up with your girlfriend,
though? Fuckin' Sam.</i>

1023
01:04:43,372 --> 01:04:45,793
<i>No wonder trife dashed her, man,
she's a fuckin' ho like.</i>

1024
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:48,003
<i>I know.
I couldn't be like that.</i>

1025
01:04:48,203 --> 01:04:50,406
<i>Only give my things
to special mans like you.</i>

1026
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:51,976
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1027
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:53,443
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1028
01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:55,234
<i>Becks, can we go?</i>

1029
01:04:55,754 --> 01:04:58,655
<i>- Where, to the party?
- No, I just wanna go home.</i>

1030
01:04:59,114 --> 01:05:00,804
<i>Well, I'm not ready.</i>

1031
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:04,511
<i>- Becky, please, can we just go?
- Look, go if you wanna go.</i>

1032
01:05:04,744 --> 01:05:08,126
<i>Don't come to the party tonight, be a
borin' cow. I'm stayin' with this lot.</i>

1033
01:05:11,592 --> 01:05:13,664
<i>You know what,
just do what you want, yeah?</i>

1034
01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:18,236
<i>Fat cunt.</i>

1035
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,551
<i>I fucked that girl
a few weeks ago, blood.</i>

1036
01:06:59,864 --> 01:07:02,285
<i>Every day for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.</i>

1037
01:07:02,487 --> 01:07:03,687
<i>Why aren't you speakin' to me?</i>

1038
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,513
<i>So this party, where is it?</i>

1039
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,907
<i>You're not still gonna go,
are you?</i>

1040
01:08:28,586 --> 01:08:31,585
<i>You saw what they done to my mum.
Where is it?</i>

1041
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,646
<i>Nice invite.</i>

1042
01:08:35,881 --> 01:08:38,051
<i>- I don't think you should go.
- Why not?</i>

1043
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,759
<i>I just think this thing with 'em lot
should stop or someone's gonna get hurt.</i>

1044
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:44,260
<i>Your mum's all right
and you got me.</i>

1045
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:47,072
<i>Stay here tonight,
we can fuck all night.</i>

1046
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,280
<i>Promise me you'll stay.</i>

1047
01:08:52,646 --> 01:08:54,206
<i>All right, I promise.</i>

1048
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:57,155
<i>I just wanna go home and check on
my mum, make sure she's all right.</i>

1049
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:01,664
<i>- Cool. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.</i>

1050
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:09,465
<i>Alisa!</i>

1051
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,194
<i>Alisa!</i>

1052
01:09:11,556 --> 01:09:13,344
<i>Wait. Alisa!</i>

1053
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:20,062
<i>- What you doin'?
- I'm goin' home. I only live over there.</i>

1054
01:09:21,218 --> 01:09:23,138
<i>- Your hand's bleedin', are you okay?
- Oh, shit.</i>

1055
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:24,443
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1056
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,167
<i>- Have you been cryin'?
- No.</i>

1057
01:09:31,936 --> 01:09:33,397
<i>You look like you have.</i>

1058
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,087
<i>Are you comin' to Blake's party?</i>

1059
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:38,838
<i>Oh, no, I'm really n
in the mood.</i>

1060
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,498
<i>Come on, come with us.</i>

1061
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:42,968
<i>I don't know.</i>

1062
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,533
<i>You look like you need to be around
some friends to cheer yourself up.</i>

1063
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:46,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

1064
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,070
<i>I promise I'll do anythin' I can
to get you smilin' again.</i>

1065
01:09:50,398 --> 01:09:51,891
<i>And how are you gonna do that?</i>

1066
01:09:57,084 --> 01:09:58,490
<i>Come on, come with me.</i>

1067
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:02,011
<i>Okay. Let me just go home
and get changed, yeah?</i>

1068
01:10:02,012 --> 01:10:04,761
<i>But I'm only gonna come, like,
if I can hang out with you.</i>

1069
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:26,388
<i>Hi, this is alisa.
Please, leave...</i>

1070
01:10:56,436 --> 01:11:00,297
<i>Trife... enter, my friend.
While the parents are away and what not.</i>

1071
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:02,988
<i>Want some of this?
It's Cuban.</i>

1072
01:11:06,547 --> 01:11:07,757
<i>Where's alisa?</i>

1073
01:11:08,114 --> 01:11:10,568
<i>She's inside.
I think she went into the garden.</i>

1074
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:03,681
<i>Bruv...</i>

1075
01:12:04,522 --> 01:12:06,015
<i>Blood, sorry, man.</i>

1076
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,460
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

1077
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:09,030
<i>Sorry, bruv.</i>

1078
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:13,632
<i>- What you doin'?
- So, what, he's your man now?</i>

1079
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,799
<i>No, but at least he's been nice to me
today. Look, what do you want?</i>

1080
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:19,520
<i>I wanted to say hello, isn't it.</i>

1081
01:12:19,688 --> 01:12:21,858
<i>- Hello.
- How you doin'?</i>

1082
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:24,422
<i>If you wanna say somethin' to me,
then say it and leave me alone.</i>

1083
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,691
<i>- Hey, what happened to your hand?
- I got it cut.</i>

1084
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:28,677
<i>- Are you all right?
- It's fine.</i>

1085
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,136
<i>No, are you all right?</i>

1086
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:37,340
<i>- So what do you do today?
- Nothin' that would interest you.</i>

1087
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:42,754
<i>Look, lis, can we go somewhere
a bit more private, please?</i>

1088
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:05,215
<i>So, what, where is he, then?</i>

1089
01:13:05,216 --> 01:13:07,103
<i>I don't know, I just saw him
come out here.</i>

1090
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:08,767
<i>I'm goin' back in, man. This is...</i>

1091
01:13:08,768 --> 01:13:10,872
<i>I don't know why
I come to your party, man.</i>

1092
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:17,656
<i>- So what time you stayin' till?
- Cool, baby, we just got here, like.</i>

1093
01:13:17,887 --> 01:13:20,853
<i>True, it'll probably
get better later.</i>

1094
01:13:21,054 --> 01:13:22,685
<i>Would be better
if Blake weren't such a chief.</i>

1095
01:13:22,686 --> 01:13:23,798
<i>Look at him tryin'
to friends up Jay.</i>

1096
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:27,475
<i>I mean... I'd consider this
a success, wouldn't you?</i>

1097
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:31,892
<i>Jay, did I mention
how sharp you look.</i>

1098
01:13:33,532 --> 01:13:34,993
<i>Go away, Blake.</i>

1099
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:42,328
<i>I know you tried to speak to me earlier
and I didn't want to listen...</i>

1100
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:45,200
<i>But I wanna talk to you now.</i>

1101
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:48,849
<i>Look, don't worry about your little
life, Trevor, I don't need your help.</i>

1102
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,238
<i>And I'm sorry you had to hear
what you heard from Sam...</i>

1103
01:13:52,442 --> 01:13:53,652
<i>And I understand
that you don't want me...</i>

1104
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,575
<i>But I thought you ought to know
that I never slept with...</i>

1105
01:13:55,769 --> 01:14:00,078
<i>All right. I know you never meant
to hurt me and blah, blah...</i>

1106
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,231
<i>But before you carry on there's some
things I need to get off my head...</i>

1107
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:03,926
<i>And if I don't,
I'm just gonna forget.</i>

1108
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:05,519
<i>- Look, Trevor, you don't...
- Wait...</i>

1109
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:11,500
<i>I'm on that, boy.</i>

1110
01:14:12,022 --> 01:14:14,410
<i>Excuse me, you came with me.</i>

1111
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:17,744
<i>No, there's a difference.
You came with me.</i>

1112
01:14:18,773 --> 01:14:20,943
<i>But don't worry, though,
babes, like...</i>

1113
01:14:21,013 --> 01:14:22,867
<i>There's enough moonies
to go around, isn't it, like.</i>

1114
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:24,272
<i>So safe, yeah?</i>

1115
01:14:24,725 --> 01:14:26,480
<i>Yeah, Danielle,
what's goin' on then, man?</i>

1116
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:28,496
<i>I see you at school the other day.
I wanted to come and talk to you...</i>

1117
01:14:28,692 --> 01:14:30,293
<i>But you're always with
your friends, man.</i>

1118
01:14:30,388 --> 01:14:32,329
<i>- You can still come up to me.
- No, but I don't like...</i>

1119
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:33,839
<i>Please.</i>

1120
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:37,677
<i>Danielle, I'm gonna come
chat to you in a sec, yeah?</i>

1121
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,976
<i>So, with both your little buddies
doin' there own thing...</i>

1122
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,904
<i>Is there anythin'
that you wanna do?</i>

1123
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:43,468
<i>Like what?</i>

<i>What?</i>

01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:48,518
<i>Do you want to fuck me?</i>

1127
01:14:49,873 --> 01:14:51,301
<i>No, not really, I got a girl.</i>

1128
01:14:51,472 --> 01:14:53,097
<i>So? I won't tell her.</i>

1129
01:14:53,552 --> 01:14:54,860
<i>I thought you liked moony?</i>

1130
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,966
<i>No, I like you.</i>

1131
01:14:57,423 --> 01:14:58,983
<i>He's a bit of a fool.</i>

1132
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:00,460
<i>That's one of my best friends
you're talkin' about down there.</i>

1133
01:15:00,527 --> 01:15:02,381
<i>Look, do you wanna fuck or not?</i>

1134
01:15:04,142 --> 01:15:08,265
<i>You can put it in my arse as well.
It hurts, but I don't mind.</i>

1135
01:15:08,814 --> 01:15:11,180
<i>No, low it, man.
Hey, Danielle.</i>

1136
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:18,069
<i>What I wanted to say is this.</i>

1137
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,743
<i>I know we were only goin' out
for a couple of months...</i>

1138
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:25,994
<i>But it was fun, dred. You made me feel
like feel good, you get me?</i>

1139
01:15:26,475 --> 01:15:30,020
<i>I mean, not just sex. I mean, your
things feel good and everythin', but...</i>

1140
01:15:31,626 --> 01:15:32,869
<i>You.</i>

1141
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:35,873
<i>It was you.</i>

1142
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:40,067
<i>But I didn't know what to do when you
started wantin' hugs and that in school.</i>

1143
01:15:40,265 --> 01:15:43,493
<i>I started thinkin' about what the boys
would think and 'em stupidness there.</i>

1144
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:47,553
<i>When I broke up with you,
I realised I was stupid.</i>

1145
01:15:48,328 --> 01:15:50,749
<i>I told everyone, "I ain't goin' back
out with her", but...</i>

1146
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:52,964
<i>I wanted to.</i>

1147
01:15:55,815 --> 01:15:58,949
<i>When I found out you fucked Sam,
it hurt me.</i>

1148
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,771
<i>- Look, Trevor...
- Wait.</i>

1149
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:04,996
<i>That hurt me.</i>

1150
01:16:06,277 --> 01:16:08,251
<i>That's why I said
what I said today.</i>

1151
01:16:10,085 --> 01:16:11,710
<i>I've seen some shit today...</i>

1152
01:16:13,797 --> 01:16:15,901
<i>Makes me think about life.</i>

1153
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,096
<i>You're one of the best things
in mine.</i>

1154
01:16:22,627 --> 01:16:25,081
<i>So even though
it's some next man's baby...</i>

1155
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,602
<i>I wanna be with you.</i>

1156
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,671
<i>And I wanna look after
you both.</i>

1157
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:33,662
<i>I wanna change for you.</i>

1158
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:36,955
<i>Because...</i>

1159
01:16:42,368 --> 01:16:43,611
<i>I love you.</i>

1160
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:48,638
<i>Why you laughin'?
I said I love you.</i>

1161
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:51,671
<i>- Trevor, I never slept with Sam.
- What?</i>

1162
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,335
<i>I've been tryin' to tell you.</i>

1163
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,413
<i>He lied. He told everyone
I went to his house.</i>

1164
01:16:56,414 --> 01:16:57,373
<i>He said I might as well go...</i>

1165
01:16:57,374 --> 01:16:59,535
<i>Because he was gonna
tell everyone he fucked me, but...</i>

1166
01:16:59,901 --> 01:17:01,940
<i>I never, I swear.</i>

1167
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,026
<i>So, the baby...</i>

1168
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,827
<i>You're the only one I've slept with.
It's yours.</i>

1169
01:17:10,332 --> 01:17:12,022
<i>- What's wrong?
- Shit.</i>

1170
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,115
<i>- My mum's gonna kill me, man.
- Mine too.</i>

1171
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:35,924
<i>Listen, listen, we're gonna work, yeah?
We'll stay together forever.</i>

1172
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:38,671
<i>I'm not sure we will...</i>

1173
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:42,162
<i>But we're gonna have this baby,
so, we should try.</i>

1174
01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:47,121
<i>Yeah, pussyhole, what now?</i>

1175
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:49,119
<i>- You think you're a man? Get up.
- Sam don't!</i>

1176
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:51,891
<i>No... you think you're bad?
You wanna act like a big man?</i>

1177
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:54,707
<i>I'm gonna beat you
like a fuckin' big man!</i>

1178
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:59,055
<i>Where's your two boys? Because you
three pussyholes are finished tonight!</i>

1179
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,995
<i>We can work somethin' out,
I swear to you.</i>

1180
01:18:02,996 --> 01:18:04,019
<i>Fuck...</i>

01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,118
<i>- Sam, man, fuckin' hell, what you doin'?

<i>You must have lost
your fuckin' mind fuckin' with me.</i>

01:18:28,016 --> 01:18:29,706
<i>We can work somethin', I swear to you.
Hey, Jay, don't, man.</i>

01:18:29,776 --> 01:18:31,630
<i>Hey, blood,

<i>You wanna disrespect my mum?
You wanna fuck my girl?</i>

01:19:08,906 --> 01:19:10,847
<i>Just leave us alone, Sam.</i>

1198
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,033
<i>Everyone knows
