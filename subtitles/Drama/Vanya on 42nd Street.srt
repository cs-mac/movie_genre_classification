1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,317
Oh! Look at this guy.

2
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,614
- Andrushki.
- Oh!

3
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,827
- How are you?
- Oh, there's Wal.

4
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:21,588
- Hi, Wal.
- Weren't we going to rehearse at 5:00?

5
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:24,049
I think it was 5:15.

6
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,801
Is, uh -

7
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,930
Mmm. What is this?

8
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,848
- It's a knish.
- Mmm.

9
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,892
There he is. Wally!

10
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,105
- Hi. Hi. Great to see you.
- Hello.

11
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,273
André, this is Mrs. Chao.

12
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:42,275
- Uh, we met last summer in Berlin.
- How do you do?

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,528
Do you mind if she comes
to our rehearsal today?

14
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:46,863
Oh, I'd be delighted.
I love to have people visit.

15
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:50,700
In fact, you've come on a great day because
we're gonna be running through the entire play.

16
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:54,579
That's wonderful.
This is my friend Flip Innunu.

17
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:57,582
You know, Mrs. Chao
was explaining to me...

18
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,003
her grandfather
actually translated Chekhov into Bengali.

19
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,797
That was a long time ago.

20
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,215
My God!

21
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:09,177
You know, I've never seen Uncle Vanya.

22
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,888
Really? Well, it's certainly, uh -

23
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,892
- What part does André play?
- Oh, uh, he's the director.

24
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:19,479
- Positive.

25
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:23,942
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to see you.

26
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:27,279
I want you to meet my cousin's niece,
Tucker, from Toledo.

27
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:31,074
- Oh, how nice to have you.
- What an amazing place! When was it built?

28
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,704
Well, I think around the turn of
the century. It's been abandoned for years.

29
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:37,414
We're just squatting here really.

30
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:40,584
And we can't use the stage
'cause the ropes, obviously...

31
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:43,253
have been eaten by, uh, rats.

32
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,505
- I've lost it.

33
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:49,593
Larry, you've been losing it for 25 years,
for as long as I've known you.

34
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:51,970
- Hi, Jer.

35
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:53,597
Hi, there.

36
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,682
Hey, André. How you doin'?

37
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:59,936
I like these, uh, squirrels.

38
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:05,400
And the faces are actually from
Shakespeare's plays, or that's what they say.

39
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:10,739
God, I am just exhausted today.
I, uh, didn't get any sleep at all last night.

40
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,200
You know,
the Ziegfeld Follies were done here.

41
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,453
There used to be, uh,
dressing rooms here...

42
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:19,998
that could accommodate 500 actors.

43
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:23,627
Now, it's a little dangerous because
it's been raining through the ceiling...

44
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:28,465
and those nets are there
to catch the plaster that's coming down.

45
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:32,010
- Watch your step, Phoebe.
- I'm all right. But you look tired.

46
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:35,889
Yeah, well, I haven't had time to catch my breath.
You see, I'm doing these two other plays.

47
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,141
They keep calling me for extra rehearsals.

48
00:04:38,226 --> 00:04:40,685
I was up at 6:00 this morning
learning lines for the rewrites...

49
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,105
on the play I'm doing
over at the Hearts and Minds Café.

50
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,234
- I've never heard of that theater.
- No reason you should've.

51
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,985
Thanks, Liz.

52
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,365
- So, what I'm doing in the first act is okay?
- Well, how does it feel?

53
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:55,617
Just very uncomfortable.

54
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:57,494
Well, that's the whole point.

55
00:04:57,578 --> 00:04:59,496
Okay.

56
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,457
- Did you go swimming today?
- I'm gonna go tonight.

57
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,960
- If I don't swim, I don't move.
- Here, come on with me.

58
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:07,337
- Like the body just -
- I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

59
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:10,006
- Under water, my hair turns green.
- my own mother?

60
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,009
- Your mother.
- My mother, she was so difficult...

61
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,512
and she was literally driving me so nuts.

62
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,847
It's all crumbling,
but it's all so beautiful.

63
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,684
Are you telling me Wally's going to strip?

64
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,561
- No. No, I just mean -
- He could, you know.

65
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,147
- He could do anything.

66
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,944
Do what you've been doing.
You know, just get it -

67
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:37,284
- Drink?
- No. No, thank you. I don't want it.

68
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,619
- A little vodka?

69
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:43,707
Not today, no. I can't drink it every day.
It's not good for me.

70
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,084
- How long have we known each other?

71
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:48,044
- How long?
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:50,547
Let me think.

73
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,132
Eleven years.

74
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:53,883
How much have I changed?

75
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,844
- How much?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:55,928 --> 00:05:58,096
Very much, I think.

77
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,057
Well, then you were young,
now you're old.

78
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,060
- Mmm.
- I think your looks have faded.

79
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:08,606
- And you're drinking now.
- Ten years' time, I've become a different man.

80
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:10,442
Oh, that's true.

81
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,402
Why?

82
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,696
Why? Overwork, simply.

83
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,449
On my feet all day, every day.

84
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,744
Every night I go to sleep
in fear I'll be called out on a call.

85
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:24,789
In the years you've known me, I have not had
one single free day. Do you know that?

86
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:28,335
And how can I help but to become old,
you tell me, living such a life?

87
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,004
- Not dead yet.
- Ha!

88
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:34,090
Some enthusiasms, some thoughts...

89
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:36,009
but quite subdued.

90
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:38,928
Dull, somehow.

91
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:42,515
There's nothing I want...

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,476
no one that I love...

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,561
nothing I need.

94
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:49,105
Well, I love you, of course.

95
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,690
- Mmm.

96
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:56,279
Third week of Lent,
I was called to Malitskoye - spotted fever.

97
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,283
There were rows of huts, people in the huts,
side by side on the floor, lying in filth.

98
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:03,745
Cattle living in the buildings with the sick,
young pigs in there in the same room.

99
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,040
- Ugh.
- All day, working, not a bite to eat.

100
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,459
I come home, thank God,
to lie down, to rest...

101
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:13,129
and they send in a switchman
hit by the train, and -

102
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:18,635
And I get him on the table,
I'm going to start operating...

103
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,637
and he dies...

104
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:22,680
under the chloroform.

105
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:26,684
The moment I least required it...

106
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,604
my conscience chose to inform me
that I'd murdered him.

107
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,233
I sat down and closed my eyes
and thought...

108
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,486
100 years from now...

109
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,614
those who come after us...

110
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:41,991
for whom our lives are showing the way -

111
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,286
will they think kindly of us?

112
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,497
Will they remember us with a kind word?

113
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:50,542
And, Nanny, I wish to God I could think so.

114
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,170
The people won't remember...

115
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,922
but God will.

116
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,341
Thank you. That was nicely said.

117
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,176
Yes, oh, yes.

118
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,598
- Sleep well?
- Yes, very.

119
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,560
I'll tell you...

120
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:11,104
since the Herr and Frau Professor
have come to visit...

121
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:14,524
my life's gone completely off the track.

122
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,693
I'm sleeping days, I'm up nights...

123
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:20,363
I'm served all sorts
of "je ne sais quoi" to eat...

124
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,031
drinking wines.

125
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:26,202
Used to be,
all day, each moment ordered -

126
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,329
work, this.

127
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:32,292
Well, Sonya's still working, of course,
but what am I doing?

128
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,878
- Modern ways.
- Ah!

129
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:38,256
- Absolutely right!

130
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,301
Yes, the professor sleeps till noon.

131
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:45,054
I keep the samovar boiling,
waiting for him to get up.

132
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,475
We used to have dinner at noon,
like people everywhere, hmm?

133
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,226
Now it's after 6:00.

134
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:53,354
He writes and reads all night.

135
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:57,025
2:00 in the morning, there's a ring.

136
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:59,027
What is it?

137
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,988
Excuse me. He wants his tea.

138
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:06,784
Wake up the house, put on the samovar.

139
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:08,453
Modern ways.

140
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:10,914
- How much longer are they here?
- Ah. A hundred years.

141
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,458
- He wants to move here.
- No!

142
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:19,214
Magnificent. Beautiful views.

143
00:09:19,298 --> 00:09:22,258
- What a prospect.
- Beautiful indeed, Your Excellency.

144
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:25,762
And tomorrow I'll show you the plantation, Papa.
Would you like that?

145
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:29,015
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
the tea is served.

146
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:33,019
Oh, would you please ask them
to send it to my study?

147
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,271
There's some things I have to do.

148
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,734
I know you'll like the plantation, Papa.

149
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,154
It's hot, sweltering.

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,783
Our great scholar dresses for December.

151
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,701
He's quite a careful man.

152
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,548
Mmm. I am happy today.

153
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:03,633
Birds singing, sun shining.

154
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:06,761
You know, whatever
I find myself doing today -

155
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:11,474
just now, walking in the garden,
or just standing here, looking at this table -

156
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:14,185
I feel happy.

157
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,770
God bless you.

158
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:17,981
- And her eyes, uh -
- Vanya.

159
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,275
- Yes.
- Tell us something.

160
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,318
- What should I tell you?
- Something new.

161
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:25,405
Something new.

162
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:28,491
What's new? Nothing's new.
Everything's old.

163
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,618
Nothing's changed.

164
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:32,161
I'm the same.

165
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,706
Probably a little bit worse
because I've grown lazy...

166
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,583
complain all day.

167
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,294
What's new?

168
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,341
Hmm? My old crow, my old mother's still
prating on about her dear rights of women...

169
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:47,385
one eye on the grave...

170
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:51,180
the other one looking in her book
for the secret of life.

171
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,182
What about the professor?

172
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,980
The professor, uh, goes on as before.

173
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:03,526
All day and half of the night,
he sits at his desk and he writes.

174
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,987
What is he working on?

175
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:09,532
Why doesn't he turn
to some magnificent subject...

176
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:12,035
like his autobiography?

177
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:13,953
Now, there's a book -

178
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:15,747
a worked-out academic...

179
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,166
gout, rheumatism, migraine...

180
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,918
the liver inflamed with jealousy and envy...

181
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:23,504
lives on the estate of his first wife.

182
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,131
From choice?

183
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:28,718
No, because he's too cheap
to live in the town.

184
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:32,889
And the man prates constantly
about his misfortunes.

185
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,309
What are they? He has none.

186
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:40,521
The son of a poor deacon.

187
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,691
He's a scholarship student at the seminary.

188
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:46,402
Gets a degree, gets a teaching chair.

189
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:50,573
Now he's "Your Excellency," and he marries
the daughter of a senator, and so on.

190
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:52,492
But I say, forget that...

191
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,828
because this man
is so exceedingly fortunate...

192
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,498
as to write and lecture for 25 years...

193
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:00,875
upon a subject
of which he knows less than nothing.

194
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:06,214
Twenty-five years,
this wise man tells us about art.

195
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,676
Twenty-five years,
he reads the works of others...

196
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,553
he prattles about realism and naturalism...

197
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:16,182
specious nonsense
which the clever have long known...

198
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:19,102
and the stupid really don't care about.

199
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,229
Not a living soul
knows who he is or cares...

200
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,856
nor is he missed from a position
which he held for 25 years.

201
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,108
Isn't that something?

202
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:29,779
For 25 years, this man kept
some more worthy man out of a job.

203
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:31,656
Yet look at him.

204
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,867
He goes around as if he were saying...

205
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:39,455
"Yes, I'm here among you."

206
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,458
Well, you know, I believe you're jealous.

207
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:46,087
Yes, I'm jealous.

208
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:48,965
What a Don Juan with women.

209
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:52,218
What a success with women is this man.

210
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,763
His first wife?

211
00:12:55,848 --> 00:12:59,350
My sister, a transcendent beauty
pure as the blue sky.

212
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,394
Generous, noble.

213
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:04,147
She had more admirers
than this man had students.

214
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:08,526
And yet she loved him, God knows why,
the way only the pure angels love.

215
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:11,612
My mother, his mother-in-law...

216
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:14,157
she dotes on him to this day.

217
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:18,369
He inspires in her reverent awe.

218
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:22,331
And his second wife,
this beauty whom we just saw...

219
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,167
perceptive woman...

220
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,960
she married him,
he was already old.

221
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:30,047
She gave up to him her life,
her beauty, her luster.

222
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:33,259
For what?
Why? I'm asking you.

223
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,344
And she stays faithful to him?

224
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:38,931
Regrettably, yes.

225
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:41,684
- Regrettably?
- Yes, and I'll tell you why.

226
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,062
Because a fidelity like that is false.

227
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:48,483
From start to close,
it's composed of rhetoric.

228
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:52,862
To cheat on an old man who revolts you,
oh, that would be immoral.

229
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:56,949
But to willfully squander your youth
and stifle yourself in unhappiness...

230
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:59,118
well, now, that's something
we can really commend.

231
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,871
Well, now, Vanya,
you shouldn't say things like that.

232
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:05,917
I mean, someone who would betray
their husband or wife...

233
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:09,879
well, they just might next betray
the country or something, you know.

234
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:11,714
Oh, please, you're killing me.

235
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,549
Now, Vanya, please allow me.

236
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:18,554
You know, my wife, she ran away from me
the day after we were married.

237
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,683
I think she just didn't like me.

238
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:26,521
But do I then forget my duty? No.

239
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:30,066
To this day, I honor and revere her...

240
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,402
and to this day,
I am absolutely faithful to her.

241
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,822
I - I do everything I can for her.

242
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:37,782
That is, I give her what I have...

243
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:40,326
so that she could raise the children...

244
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,329
which she had
with the man that she loved.

245
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,792
Oh, have I given up happiness?
Yes, but I've kept my pride.

246
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,669
And what of her?

247
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:52,338
There she is, now no longer young.

248
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:55,258
Her beauty, as it must, has faded.

249
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,468
Her lover died.

250
00:14:57,553 --> 00:15:00,179
What does she have now, hmm?

251
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,141
Nanny?

252
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,436
You go see to the chickens,
and I'll tend to the tea.

253
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,021
Yes.

254
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:16,946
You know, I came to see your husband.

255
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,448
You wrote he was deathly ill
with rheumatism complications...

256
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:21,534
and it seems
he's in the perfect pink of health.

257
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:23,953
- Ah, last night he was ill.
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:26,289
He complained of his legs.

259
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:29,542
Um, today, though, you're right.
He does seem fine.

260
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:31,377
Yes, he seems fine...

261
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:33,796
and I flat-out galloped 45 miles.

262
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,924
Never mind. It isn't the first time.

263
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,970
All right, um, I'll stay here tonight then,
if you don't mind.

264
00:15:41,054 --> 00:15:42,722
At least I'll get some sleep.

265
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:45,474
Lovely. It's so rare
you spend the night here with us.

266
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,810
I - I don't suspect you've eaten,
have you?

267
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:50,730
No. Many thanks, and thank you kindly.
No, I haven't. No.

268
00:15:50,814 --> 00:15:53,316
Well, then you'll get your rest
and your supper.

269
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,903
These days we're not dining until 6:00.

270
00:15:58,155 --> 00:15:59,488
Cold tea.

271
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:03,409
Yes, the temperature in the samovar
markedly decreased.

272
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,078
No matter, Ivan Ivanich.
We'll drink it cold.

273
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:10,833
Oh, no, no. It's not Ivan Ivanich,
it's Ilya Ilych, ma'am.

274
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,168
Uh, Ilya Ilych.

275
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:15,421
Or you might want to call me Waffles,
as some do...

276
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:18,716
on account of the pockmarks on my face.

277
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,469
- Waffles.
- I know Your Excellency - your husband.

278
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:25,348
He knows me very well. We're old friends.
I lived right here on the estate.

279
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:28,893
You've probably seen me there at the table,
having dinner with you every night.

280
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:31,812
Ilya llych is our good right hand.

281
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:35,024
- Would you like some tea, Godfather?
- No, no.

282
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,526
Ah!

283
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:41,197
Ah, God!

284
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:44,617
- What's the matter, Grandmother?

285
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:47,745
Forgot to tell Alexandr...

286
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:51,499
I received a letter from Kharkov today.

287
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,876
Pavel Alexeyevich
sent me his newest pamphlet.

288
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:55,419
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:57,505
- Is it interesting?
- Yes.

290
00:16:58,674 --> 00:17:00,174
Interesting, yes...

291
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,386
but strange.

292
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:09,183
He's now refuting the very same things
he defended...

293
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,726
seven years ago.

294
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:13,354
How, how, how, how -

295
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,731
How... what?

296
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,068
How awful.

297
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,321
Nothing awful in it.
It happens all the time.

298
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,407
So just drink your tea, Mother.

299
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,660
No.

300
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,745
I want to talk.

301
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,249
We all want to talk.

302
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,126
We've been talking.

303
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,879
We've been talking and reading
and writing pamphlets...

304
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:40,548
for 50 years...

305
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:42,466
and I say, enough.

306
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:47,263
Why is it unpleasant for you
to hear me speak?

307
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,848
Oh!

308
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,769
Excuse me, Jean, but you have changed so much
this last year, I hardly know you.

309
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:56,355
You used to be a man of character...

310
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:01,736
a man of fine opinions,
an enlightened man, and now -

311
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,031
Oh, yes. I was so enlightened...

312
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:08,826
it's unfortunate
I lit the way for no one.

313
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,662
An enlightened man.
What worse could you say about me?

314
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,873
- I'm 47 years old.

315
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:17,960
Up until one year ago,
I thought exactly the same way you did.

316
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:24,467
I joyed to cloud my mind
with this rank scholasticism...

317
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:26,927
that we all hold so dear...

318
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,847
not to see real life.

319
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,391
I knew that I was doing right.

320
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,852
What a fine man.

321
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:39,565
Now, if you'll excuse me,
if you only knew.

322
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:43,277
How can we know if you don't tell us?

323
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:47,823
I- I spend my nights in a vicious fury...

324
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,785
at the life I've let slip away from me.

325
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,246
I could have enjoyed everything in life.
I could have enjoyed everything!

326
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,333
I enjoyed nothing!

327
00:18:57,417 --> 00:18:59,001
Now I'm too old.

328
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:00,711
Uncle, it's so depressing.

329
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:03,380
Are you blaming your former convictions?

330
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:08,177
What you say is not the fault
of your convictions - it's your fault!

331
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:12,932
It's your own fault!

332
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:17,686
Convictions by themselves are nothing.

333
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:20,439
Like - Like paint on a palette.

334
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:23,150
It's you who should have been working,
you who should have been using them...

335
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,527
doing real work.

336
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:25,694
- Oh, real work?
- Yes!

337
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:28,864
Well, not everyone is called,
you know, like our Herr Professor...

338
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:32,952
to go speaking and writing
and spewing work forth...

339
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,703
like some farm machine.

340
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,288
What do you mean by that?

341
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:38,749
Grandmother, Uncle Vanya, please!

342
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,628
I'm sorry. I'm done.

343
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:45,631
I am silent. Excuse me.

344
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,512
What a lovely day today.

345
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,099
Not too hot.

346
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:57,059
Excellent weather for -

347
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,728
Suicide.

348
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:01,814
Chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!

349
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,899
Chick, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!

350
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:07,361
- Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!
- Nanny, which one are you calling?

351
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,905
Polka Dot has gone off with her chicks.

352
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,907
I don't want the crows to get them.

353
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,243
Here, chick, chick, chick,
chick, chick, chick, chick!

354
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,997
- Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!

355
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,585
- Uh, Doctor, they've come for you.
- Who?

356
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,462
Uh, from the factory.
There's been - They need you.

357
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,757
Fine. Well, I have to go, damn it.
What a shame.

358
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:33,762
I'm so sorry. Um, why don't you
come back for supper, after the factory?

359
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:38,184
Well, it'd be too late then, won't it?
How could I? How could I?

360
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,477
Waffles, get me a glass of vodka,
would you, please?

361
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:42,688
Glass of vodka.

362
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:45,816
Well, if you should like to stop by sometime,
perhaps with Sophie here...

363
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,443
I would be most delighted.

364
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:49,695
I only have the 80 acres,
but if it interested you...

365
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,741
next to me we have a model orchard
such as you won't see within a thousand miles.

366
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,451
It's a state reserve.

367
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:58,120
And the, um, overseer, the old forester...

368
00:20:58,205 --> 00:20:59,872
he's usually ill, you see...

369
00:20:59,956 --> 00:21:02,791
and actually
I get to oversee the work myself.

370
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:05,753
- Yes, they told me you loved the woods.
- Oh, yes.

371
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:10,257
I- I suppose there's much good
to be done there.

372
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:12,134
Oh, much good.

373
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,846
But my question is, doesn't it interfere
with your real calling?

374
00:21:15,931 --> 00:21:17,973
My real calling?

375
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:20,684
God knows what our real calling is.

376
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,813
The woods. You find them interesting.

377
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:27,650
Interesting? Fascinating, yes.

378
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,652
Yes. Fascinating.

379
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:35,282
You don't seem that old.

380
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:39,161
What would we say? Um, 36, 37?

381
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,163
- So?

382
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,875
Well, how interesting can that be, really,
alone in the woods all the time?

383
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,835
I should find it quite monotonous.

384
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,005
No, it's-it's really -
it's really quite interesting.

385
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:55,302
Every year he plots new forests
or he makes a plan to conserve the old ones.

386
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:58,013
He's received both a medal
and a diploma for his work.

387
00:21:58,098 --> 00:22:01,225
If you listen to him,
you'll see what he means.

388
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:05,062
He says that forests embellish the land...

389
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:08,315
and that they instill in man
a love of beauty...

390
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,526
that they raise the mind.

391
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,070
Um, they moderate the climate...

392
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,281
and in the lands
where the climate is milder...

393
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:17,283
then people struggle less with nature...

394
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:20,369
and the people in those lands
are milder and gentler...

395
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:24,707
and their speech is more refined,
and their movements are more graceful...

396
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:29,044
and they cultivate the arts and sciences,
and there's joy in their philosophy...

397
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:31,297
and they treat women with nobleness.

398
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:35,718
Bravo! Bravo! This is magnificent.

399
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:40,097
But now it's not convincing, my friend,
as I still must fuel my stoves...

400
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,058
and build with those same woods
that you prize.

401
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:44,893
- Burn peat in your stoves.
- Hmm?

402
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:47,730
Build your barn of stones.
You understand?

403
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:50,858
Yes, sometimes we cut wood
out of necessity.

404
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:54,069
But why be wanton? Why?

405
00:22:54,154 --> 00:22:57,156
Our forests fall before the ax.

406
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,283
Billions of trees, all perishing.

407
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:02,953
The homes of birds and beasts
being laid waste.

408
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,581
The level of the rivers falls,
and they dry up.

409
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:08,250
Sublime landscapes disappear,
never to return...

410
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:12,379
because we haven't sense enough to bend down
and pick fuel up from the ground.

411
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,423
Isn't this so?

412
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:18,260
What must human beings be
to destroy what they can never create?

413
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:22,056
God's given us reason and power of thought
so that we may improve our lot...

414
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,767
and what have we used these powers for
but waste?

415
00:23:25,685 --> 00:23:28,812
We've destroyed our forests,
our rivers run dry...

416
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:31,315
our wildlife is all but extinct...

417
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,817
our climate ruined.

418
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:37,321
And every day, every day,
wherever one looks...

419
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:39,573
our life is more hideous.

420
00:23:39,657 --> 00:23:41,784
Oh, I see. You think me amusing.

421
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:44,495
These seem to you the thoughts
of some poor eccentric.

422
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:47,122
Perhaps -
Perhaps it's naive, too, on my part.

423
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:51,251
Perhaps you think that, but I pass
by the woods I've saved from the ax...

424
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:54,171
and I hear the forest sighing.

425
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,257
I planted that forest.

426
00:23:57,342 --> 00:23:59,968
And I think things may be in our power.

427
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:04,181
You understand?
Perhaps the climate itself is in our control.

428
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,891
Why not?

429
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:08,477
And if in a thousand years,
people are happy...

430
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:11,438
I will have played a part
in that happiness.

431
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:13,232
A small part.

432
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:16,652
I plant a birch tree.
I watch it take root.

433
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:19,405
It grows. It sways in the wind.

434
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,158
And I feel such pride.

435
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,914
Well. Well, my time is up.
I must be off.

436
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,421
Thank you, Waffles.

437
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,841
And, of course, it's possible
I am just an eccentric.

438
00:24:43,763 --> 00:24:46,306
And thank you for the honor
of your hospitality.

439
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:52,646
- When will we see you again?
- I can't say.

440
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,023
Sooner than next month, I hope.

441
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,916
You -

442
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,544
What?

443
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:17,754
You've fallen into
one of your moods again?

444
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,715
- Excuse me?
- You're being impossible.

445
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,217
- Was I?
- Yes, you were.

446
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:24,928
- Why are you baiting your mother?

447
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:28,056
And this morning at breakfast,
you quarreled with Alexandr.

448
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:29,475
Yes!

449
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,393
Excuse me.

450
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:32,769
- How petty.
- Petty?

451
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:34,354
- Yes.
- What if I hate him?

452
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,231
- Why should you hate him?

453
00:25:36,316 --> 00:25:38,650
He's like everybody else.

454
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:42,237
He's no worse than you.

455
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:44,823
Oh, look at yourself.

456
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:47,659
Look at your face.
Look at the way you move.

457
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:50,913
You're too lazy to live, with your torpor.

458
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:53,582
- Too lazy to live?
- Yes, you are.

459
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,167
Yes.

460
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,127
I am.

461
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,713
I'm too bored.

462
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,424
Do you know?

463
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:05,010
Everyone berates my husband.

464
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:07,137
Everyone berates him.

465
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:11,642
Everybody pities me. Oh, the poor woman
saddled with such an old man.

466
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,477
They're so concerned for me.

467
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:16,605
I mean, you must excuse me,
but it's quite disgusting. Don't you think so?

468
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:20,859
Why can you not look with indifference
on a woman who's not your own?

469
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,487
- Why? Because the doctor's right.

470
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:27,115
There is in each one of you a demon
of destruction that spares nothing -

471
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,160
neither forests, birds, women...

472
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:32,079
nor each other.

473
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:36,542
You know, I don't care for that philosophy.

474
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:43,715
He has an interesting face.

475
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,760
- "He"?
- Our doctor.

476
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:51,306
- Yes?
- Nervous face.

477
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:53,350
A tired face, I think.

478
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,603
- Sonya finds him attractive.

479
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:58,355
I think she's in love with him.

480
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:00,399
I understand it.

481
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:05,153
Do you know he's been here three times
since I first came...

482
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:07,739
and I haven't once
spoken with him properly?

483
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,077
What must he think?

484
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,541
He must think I'm mean.

485
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,293
Oh, must he?

486
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,797
I've never shown him any kindness.

487
00:27:24,924 --> 00:27:28,176
- Do you know why we're such good friends?
- No.

488
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:31,013
It's because we're both tiresome people.

489
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:33,599
- We're both dull.

490
00:27:38,229 --> 00:27:41,064
No, please don't look at me that way.
I don't like it.

491
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:43,609
Well, how else am I supposed to look at you?
I love you!

492
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,739
I look at you, and I see my life -

493
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:51,241
I see my youth and I see my happiness.

494
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:55,120
I know that the chance that you could
reciprocate those feelings...

495
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:58,206
is nothing.

496
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,042
- But I want nothing.

497
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:03,545
- I just want you to permit me to look at you -
- Shh!

498
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,089
- And to hear your voice.
- Shh! Someone will hear you.

499
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:10,177
I just want you to let me speak with you
and just to be near you.

500
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,847
Oh, God.

501
00:28:13,931 --> 00:28:15,682
This is awful.

502
00:28:28,154 --> 00:28:30,155
Good. Okay.

503
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,116
Uh, the next act is -
it's a couple of weeks later.

504
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,869
It's in the dining room,
and it's very late at night.

505
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:37,829
Would you follow me?

506
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:13,240
- Who's there? Sonya, is that you?
- It's me.

507
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:16,326
Lenotchka, I'm in pain. Help me.

508
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,912
Your blankets fell.
I'll close the window.

509
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,540
No, no, no. It's stifling in here.

510
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,168
I dozed off...

511
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:29,923
and dreamed that my leg
belonged to someone else.

512
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,885
I was awoken by the pain.

513
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:39,683
I don't think it's gout.
I think it's rheumatism!

514
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,064
What time is it?

515
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,693
Twenty past 12:00.

516
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,614
In the morning,
please go to the library...

517
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:57,367
and look for the Batiushkov.

518
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:00,537
- I think we have him.
- Hmm?

519
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:02,372
Look for -

520
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:05,584
In the morning,
please look for the Batiushkov.

521
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:08,503
I remember we have him.
Why can I not breathe?

522
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:11,298
Two nights with no sleep.
You're tired.

523
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:21,099
They say Turgenev
developed angina pectoris from gout.

524
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:23,852
I'll get it too.

525
00:30:26,022 --> 00:30:28,315
Damn old age.

526
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,736
Damn, revolting, impotent old age.

527
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:35,781
I grow more repulsive to myself.

528
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:41,453
And I'm sure you, too,
find it revolting to look on me.

529
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:43,997
Do you know,
you speak of your age in a tone...

530
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:47,250
that suggests that it's our fault
you've grown old?

531
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:49,753
I revolt you most of all.

532
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:52,130
You're right, of course.

533
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:55,801
You're young, you're healthy,
you're beautiful, you want to live.

534
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:59,805
Here am I, an old man,
more than one foot in the grave.

535
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,766
- Isn't that right?
- Oh, God.

536
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,851
- Of course that's right.
- Oh.

537
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:09,272
How foolish of me to still keep on living.

538
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:10,857
Please.

539
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:12,567
- Be patient.
- I'm ready to collapse.

540
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:16,822
- Soon I'll set you all free. Yes.
- What must I do? Please, be silent.

541
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,866
Because of me
you're all ready to collapse, all of you.

542
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:24,246
- Everyone bored.
- Oh!

543
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,206
Wasting their youth.

544
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,041
I'm the only one content. I see it.

545
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,460
- Oh, you're destroying me.
- Yes!

546
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:33,046
Of course I'm destroying everyone.

547
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:43,974
What do you want from me?

548
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:48,562
Nothing.

549
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:57,863
Well, then be quiet.

550
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:07,205
Fine. Let us stipulate.

551
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,165
I am repulsive.

552
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,460
I am a despot.
I am that sick egoist you all think me to be.

553
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:14,462
But have I not earned it?

554
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:17,465
I worked all my life for science,
respected and honored.

555
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,634
And then I'm thrust, thrust...

556
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,344
for no apparent reason...

557
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:23,972
into this tomb among the mindless...

558
00:32:24,056 --> 00:32:26,975
every day
their prattle stuffing my ears.

559
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,728
I want to live.

560
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,148
Here, I'm in exile.

561
00:32:33,232 --> 00:32:36,735
Every waking moment
I can pine for the past...

562
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:38,862
envy the success of others...

563
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,948
or I can fear death.

564
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:46,202
Those three choices are my life.

565
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,662
Have patience.

566
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,833
Five or six more years, I'll be old too.

567
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:53,418
- Hmm?

568
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,967
- Papa.

569
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,679
Papa, you sent for Dr. Astrov.

570
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:07,390
Now he's here, and you don't want him.

571
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:10,644
What am I supposed to tell him
now that we've called him here for nothing?

572
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,520
What good can Astrov do me?

573
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:15,732
The man knows as much of medicine
as I do of beekeeping.

574
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:18,526
What am I to tell him, please?
We sent for him.

575
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,737
The man's a fool!
I don't want to speak to him.

576
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:23,114
Well, as you wish then! Fine!

577
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:28,161
What time is it?

578
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:30,246
It's almost 1:00.

579
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:33,375
I can't breathe.

580
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:37,045
Please, Sonya, my drops -
they're on the table.

581
00:33:39,465 --> 00:33:41,132
Just a moment.

582
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:52,560
No, not these!
The ones I asked for, for God's sake!

583
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,733
Some people might appreciate
this peevishness!

584
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:00,276
I do not.

585
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:02,779
Please spare me. I don't like it.

586
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:05,865
I need my rest.
Tomorrow is a working day!

587
00:34:10,955 --> 00:34:13,081
- Well, there's a storm brewing outside.
- Oh.

588
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,918
Did you see that lightning?

589
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:20,588
Yelena and Sonya, off to bed.

590
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:23,925
You are relieved.

591
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,178
Oh, please don't leave me alone with him.
He'll talk me to death.

592
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,849
- They need their rest.
- No.

593
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,351
They need their rest.
Two nights without sleep?

594
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:36,396
All right, fine.
Both of you, off to bed.

595
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,149
And you, too, please.
Sincerely, with thanks.

596
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,277
In the name of our friendship,
please leave me alone.

597
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:45,280
Don't leave me alone with him.
I'm quite serious.

598
00:34:45,364 --> 00:34:48,283
- You know, this is becoming funny.

599
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:51,953
Nanny, what are you doing up?
You should be in bed.

600
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:54,831
Fine. Samovar is on the table.

601
00:34:54,915 --> 00:34:57,292
Easy to say "Go to bed."

602
00:34:57,376 --> 00:35:01,337
Everybody's up.
Everybody's fatigued beyond measure.

603
00:35:01,422 --> 00:35:03,339
I'm the only one happy.

604
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:05,008
I'm ecstatic.

605
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,594
What's the matter, little father?

606
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:09,971
Your legs? Oh.

607
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:11,848
My legs hurt too.

608
00:35:11,932 --> 00:35:15,643
I have the 'ralgia. 'Ralgia all day.

609
00:35:15,728 --> 00:35:19,856
Sonya's sainted mother
took it so to heart when you hurt.

610
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,902
She loved you so, that woman. Mmm.

611
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:26,613
Well, the old are like the young.

612
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:28,990
They want someone to pity them.

613
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,701
But nobody ever feels sorry for the old.

614
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:34,329
Now, you go to bed now, little father...

615
00:35:34,413 --> 00:35:37,123
and I'll make you some linden tea.

616
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,542
And I'll warm your feet for you.

617
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:43,046
- And I'll pray for you. Yes, I will.
- Oh, go on. Go on.

618
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,256
Now, come - Oh! 'Ralgia. Oh.

619
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:47,926
Come to bed. That's right.

620
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:58,269
I've been so tired by him,
I can hardly stand.

621
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:01,689
You're tired by him?

622
00:36:01,774 --> 00:36:04,109
I'm sick of myself.

623
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,988
Two nights without sleep.
I'm tired to nausea.

624
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:12,617
This is not a happy home.

625
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:19,415
Your mother loathes everything in the world
except her pamphlets.

626
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:22,544
And the professor -

627
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,464
the professor mistrusts me.

628
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:31,261
- He fears you.
- He fears me?

629
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:34,806
Yes, he does.

630
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,018
Sonya's angry with her father...

631
00:36:40,104 --> 00:36:43,314
pettish with me,
hasn't spoken to me in the last two weeks.

632
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:46,317
Not one word.

633
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:48,903
And you hate my husband.

634
00:36:48,988 --> 00:36:51,614
You despise your mother
and you make no effort to conceal it.

635
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,242
I go around 20 times a day,
I'm on the edge of tears.

636
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:56,494
One would not say this is a happy home.

637
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,873
Oh, let's drop this discourse, shall we?

638
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:02,458
You're an educated man...

639
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,919
a thoughtful man.

640
00:37:05,004 --> 00:37:08,006
Our world is not worsened
by fires or by robbers...

641
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,633
but do you understand?

642
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:12,218
By hate.

643
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:15,722
Our world's destroyed by hate...

644
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:18,433
by pettiness.

645
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:21,936
And your job should be to be strong...

646
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,606
and not to carp at those around you,
not to grumble...

647
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,609
but simply to reconcile
and to make peace.

648
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,199
- I'd make my peace with you.
- No, stop that.

649
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,872
I'd like it if you left.

650
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:47,712
Now, please.

651
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:54,135
The rain is ending.
Everything will be refreshed.

652
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,096
The earth exhales.

653
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:00,767
But I will not be refreshed...

654
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:03,478
by the coming and the passing
of the storm.

655
00:38:04,313 --> 00:38:06,814
My whole life, day and night, I feel that...

656
00:38:08,025 --> 00:38:11,194
I've squandered my past on nonsense.

657
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:15,323
My present is sunk in absurdity.

658
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,661
My one feeling is for you.

659
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:22,497
How can I renounce it?
My one feeling in life.

660
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,668
It's dying like a ray of sun
that's shone into a well.

661
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,670
You speak to me...

662
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:30,255
of love?

663
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:33,424
How am I to deal with that?

664
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,970
Forgive me. I must say good night.

665
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:40,265
Coincidentally, though,
here by my side...

666
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,142
another person's life
is being wasted in this house.

667
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:45,895
Whose could that be?

668
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,232
What are you waiting for?
For your life to end?

669
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,196
What stupid, pointless principle
is standing in your way?

670
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:59,242
Do you comprehend
what I'm trying to tell you?

671
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,953
Are you drunk?

672
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,333
- It could very well be.

673
00:39:10,004 --> 00:39:11,921
Where's the doctor?

674
00:39:12,006 --> 00:39:15,300
- He's spending the night in my room.

675
00:39:15,384 --> 00:39:17,427
Could be. It could be.

676
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:20,096
- Anything could be.

677
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:23,933
- Why have you been drinking?
- Why?

678
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:27,895
Because it gives me the illusion...

679
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,939
that I might be alive.

680
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,900
Don't scold me.

681
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:36,404
You never used to drink.

682
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:38,740
- I drink now.
- Yeah, I know.

683
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:42,994
- And you never spoke so much.
- I didn't?

684
00:39:43,078 --> 00:39:44,579
Perhaps that's just -

685
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:47,081
Go to bed. You bore me.

686
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,458
Do I?

687
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:51,127
Oh, my enchanted one, my darling.

688
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,547
No, no, no. God, you disgust me!

689
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:07,101
Ten years ago...

690
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:09,187
I'd see her at my sister's.

691
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,148
She was 17...

692
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:15,234
and I was 37.

693
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:21,699
I could have proposed to her,
and now she'd be my wife...

694
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:25,495
and both of us would've
been woken by the storm.

695
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:29,791
The thunder frightened you.

696
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:32,960
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

697
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:39,425
Why, in the name of God, am I old?
What happened to me?

698
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,016
It's that damned pseudo-morality...

699
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:51,479
and that lazy, stupid intellect.

700
00:40:51,563 --> 00:40:53,981
Jargon, ideas about the "ruin of the world."

701
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,734
Who the hell does she think she is?

702
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:05,243
They cheated me.

703
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:07,912
I worshipped that man.

704
00:41:07,996 --> 00:41:11,332
Sonya and I,
we squeezed the last dregs...

705
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:14,502
from that estate like slaves.

706
00:41:15,587 --> 00:41:17,588
Begrudged ourselves food.

707
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:20,341
We sent thousands to him.

708
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,679
Why shouldn't we to a man of genius?

709
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:27,557
We basked in him.

710
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:31,185
Now the man retires...

711
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,438
it's screamingly clear.

712
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,359
What does he leave as his legacy?
This colossus?

713
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:40,111
What work? What -

714
00:41:41,488 --> 00:41:43,322
He leaves nothing.

715
00:41:45,576 --> 00:41:47,368
Not a single page.

716
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:49,704
A nothing, a fraud.

717
00:41:51,248 --> 00:41:53,875
A vicious failure...

718
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:59,088
who cheated a man who loved him.

719
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:05,178
- Play something.
- No, no, no, no. The whole house is asleep.

720
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:06,971
Oh, play it.

721
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:11,058
Aww!

722
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,060
All alone?

723
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,813
No ladies, eh?

724
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:20,318
The house is flying
The stove is flying

725
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:23,529
Where can the master make his bed?

726
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,531
The storm woke me.

727
00:42:26,325 --> 00:42:28,159
Some rain.

728
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,745
I heard Yelena.

729
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:32,747
Very probably.

730
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,665
She's a splendid woman.

731
00:42:39,296 --> 00:42:42,006
God help us when doctors disagree.

732
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:48,262
Is there a town whose pharmacy's
not represented here?

733
00:42:48,347 --> 00:42:51,057
The whole region must be sick of his gout.

734
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:55,478
You tell me - is he ill or shamming?

735
00:42:57,022 --> 00:42:58,564
He's ill.

736
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:01,150
And you? What's your complaint?
A sympathetic nature?

737
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,820
Or could you be sick with love
for the invalid's wife?

738
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:08,449
- We're just friends.
- Already?

739
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:11,494
Well, now, what could that mean?

740
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:15,081
A woman and a man can be friends
only at the end term of this sequence:

741
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:17,208
First, acquaintances...

742
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:19,669
and then lovers...

743
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,671
and then -

744
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:23,756
that's right, friends.

745
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:28,052
A lovely, elegant philosophy.

746
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:29,887
Ya think so?

747
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:33,641
Yes, I confess, I'm becoming a vulgarian.

748
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:36,185
I'm drunk too.

749
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:41,566
And when I am this drunk, I become arrogant
and brazen to the last degree.

750
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,735
And nothing in that state
can faze me then.

751
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,322
I undertake and perform
the most difficult feats flawlessly.

752
00:43:49,324 --> 00:43:52,493
I see the future
and devise the most elegant plans.

753
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:56,497
And during this time,
I no longer seem to myself...

754
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:59,834
an awkward and useless
member of this world.

755
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:02,461
No, I seem, on the contrary...

756
00:44:02,546 --> 00:44:04,171
a powerful, a motive force...

757
00:44:04,256 --> 00:44:06,299
with my own system
of thought and philosophy.

758
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:09,427
And all of you, my dears - because it's true -
look as big as cockroaches...

759
00:44:10,429 --> 00:44:14,015
Or some quite, quite unimportant things.

760
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,350
- Would you play, please?
- Anything for you.

761
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:19,270
Play, play! Ah!
Let's have a drink. Come on.

762
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:21,856
And in the daylight, we'll go to my place.
Ya up for it?

763
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,400
Fellow works for me
says that the whole time: "Ya up for it?"

764
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:35,286
Um - Excuse me, I'm -

765
00:44:36,288 --> 00:44:38,414
I'm going to go get dressed.

766
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:45,921
Uncle Vanya?

767
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:49,133
You got drunk with the doctor again?

768
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:54,055
Two free voices
found each other in the night...

769
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:56,057
and formed a pact.

770
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:01,812
Why do you do this?

771
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:07,568
At your age, it's truly unattractive.

772
00:45:07,653 --> 00:45:09,320
My age doesn't come into it.

773
00:45:09,404 --> 00:45:10,738
No?

774
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:13,658
A man with nothing in his life...

775
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:15,743
with no real life...

776
00:45:15,827 --> 00:45:18,454
subsists on a fantasy.

777
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:21,540
Then that is something in his life.

778
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:25,586
The hay is cut. Every day it rains.
Everything is rotting.

779
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,672
And you're living on fantasy.

780
00:45:29,132 --> 00:45:33,135
You've thrown your work up,
and I'm working alone, and I'm tired.

781
00:45:34,346 --> 00:45:36,347
You neglect your job.

782
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:43,145
You know,
just now when you looked at me...

783
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,399
you looked just like your dear mother.

784
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:51,028
Phew, my darling sister.

785
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:56,283
Where are you now?

786
00:45:57,285 --> 00:45:59,745
Oh, my dear...

787
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:01,747
if you only knew.

788
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,835
What is it she should know?

789
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:09,130
It isn't good. It isn't good.

790
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:11,757
It's nothing.

791
00:46:15,095 --> 00:46:17,054
I'm going.

792
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:42,913
Can I have a word with you, please?

793
00:46:44,499 --> 00:46:47,334
If it aids you to drink, then please drink.

794
00:46:47,419 --> 00:46:51,756
But please don't let my uncle drink anymore.
It's very bad for him.

795
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,841
So be it. We'll drink no more.

796
00:46:55,677 --> 00:46:57,636
I can count on you?

797
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:59,555
Settled and signed.

798
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:05,311
Ah! Now I'll be getting home.

799
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:07,772
Well, why don't you just stay
until the morning?

800
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,523
- Oh, no, no.
- It's raining.

801
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:11,776
Storm will pass.
I think that this is the end of it.

802
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,111
No, I'll go. One thing, please.

803
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:16,197
Don't call me for your father anymore.

804
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:19,617
I tell him gout, he says rheumatism.
I say stay in bed, he gets up.

805
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:21,619
I'm called to see him, he won't speak to me.

806
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:23,370
He's difficult.

807
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:28,125
Uh, can - can I get you something to eat?

808
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:31,962
Yes, I'll take something. Thank you.

809
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:36,383
They say that through his life,
he had a great success with women...

810
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:38,552
and that women spoiled him.

811
00:47:40,013 --> 00:47:43,724
Today I didn't eat a thing.
Today I drank.

812
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:46,727
Yes, your father's difficult.

813
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,481
You know, we're alone here.

814
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,483
Let's speak candidly, do you think?

815
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,944
I couldn't live one month in this house.

816
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:57,321
I'd suffocate
with your father and his gout...

817
00:47:57,405 --> 00:48:00,991
and your uncle
and his - what is it, depression?

818
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,536
Your grandmother.

819
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,412
Your stepmother.

820
00:48:05,497 --> 00:48:07,832
- My stepmother.
- Hmm.

821
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,751
Beauty should be pure.

822
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:13,838
Of face, of dress, of the mind.

823
00:48:14,756 --> 00:48:18,676
And here is a beautiful -
a lovely woman...

824
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,513
and all she does is eat, sleep
and stroll through the day...

825
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:26,183
to enchant us
with that great beauty which is hers.

826
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:29,186
She does no more. She has no duties.
She has no responsibilities.

827
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:31,730
Others work for her.

828
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:34,483
How can an idle life be pure?

829
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,778
Am I too hard?

830
00:48:37,863 --> 00:48:40,447
Perhaps I am.

831
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:44,451
I'm like your Uncle Vanya -
disappointed in life, become a detractor.

832
00:48:44,536 --> 00:48:46,829
Disappointed in life?

833
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:49,290
Um, in life? No.

834
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:52,126
In our life.

835
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,669
Our provincial life.

836
00:48:53,753 --> 00:48:56,505
I hate it with the power of my soul.

837
00:48:57,507 --> 00:48:59,508
And my life - oh, yes.

838
00:49:00,552 --> 00:49:03,137
In my own personal life,
I am pleased to swear to God...

839
00:49:03,221 --> 00:49:05,472
there's not one thing good in it.

840
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:09,727
When you walk through the woods...

841
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:14,189
if you walk through
the dark woods at night...

842
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:18,819
if you have a glimmer,
a small gleam of light before you...

843
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,198
then you needn't feel the night...

844
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:26,118
nor darkness, fatigue.

845
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:30,831
Nor the branches as they whip your face.

846
00:49:33,668 --> 00:49:36,670
But, as you know, I work alone...

847
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:38,714
and live alone.

848
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:39,965
There is no one.

849
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,134
And those things which assail me...

850
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:44,803
as there is no light before me...

851
00:49:45,847 --> 00:49:48,140
which could make my burden light.

852
00:49:51,394 --> 00:49:53,687
So, I expect nothing...

853
00:49:53,772 --> 00:49:55,773
and there is nothing for me.

854
00:49:57,692 --> 00:49:59,193
And do you know?

855
00:49:59,277 --> 00:50:01,612
I don't like people.

856
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:04,573
And for the longest time...

857
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:06,450
I've loved no one.

858
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:09,995
You've loved no one?

859
00:50:11,456 --> 00:50:13,332
No one.

860
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,959
Hmm.

861
00:50:15,043 --> 00:50:16,752
Well...

862
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:18,796
I feel a certain affection.

863
00:50:22,258 --> 00:50:25,552
I feel affection, for example,
toward Nanny.

864
00:50:27,222 --> 00:50:28,889
- You do?
- Yes.

865
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:31,976
Our peasants are so alive,
living in squalor.

866
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,561
And what do we live in?
Our intelligentsia.

867
00:50:34,646 --> 00:50:38,732
Our good and simple friends,
to put it bluntly, you understand.

868
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:41,360
Small concerns,
small thoughts and feelings.

869
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:45,572
And the brighter they are, the worse they are -
assailed by introspection and analysis.

870
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:47,366
I mean, what's happened to the world?

871
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,827
They whine and spew and slander...

872
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:53,580
"Oh, this one's a psychopath,
that one's a phrasemonger."

873
00:50:53,665 --> 00:50:56,959
And then let them find someone
whom they can't pigeonhole...

874
00:50:57,043 --> 00:50:59,545
and that one's the most eccentric person.

875
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:02,506
I love the forest. I don't eat meat.

876
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,508
A most eccentric person.

877
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:08,804
Where could we look to find a simple,
unencumbered and spontaneous relation...

878
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:10,431
to our fellows and the world?

879
00:51:10,515 --> 00:51:13,809
Where? Nowhere.
Nowhere on this earth, I assure you.

880
00:51:16,354 --> 00:51:17,980
Please don't drink anymore.

881
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:19,565
Why not?

882
00:51:19,649 --> 00:51:22,151
Because it isn't like you, that's why.

883
00:51:22,235 --> 00:51:24,278
Is that what you think?

884
00:51:24,362 --> 00:51:26,238
You are refined.

885
00:51:26,322 --> 00:51:28,490
You - You have a gentle voice.

886
00:51:29,993 --> 00:51:33,996
You, more than anyone I know,
are as you spoke of - beautiful.

887
00:51:35,999 --> 00:51:38,459
- Why do you act in an ordinary way?
- I?

888
00:51:38,543 --> 00:51:40,878
- You drink, you gamble.
- Do I?

889
00:51:40,962 --> 00:51:43,088
Please stop.

890
00:51:43,173 --> 00:51:46,258
You said that we work not to create
but to destroy...

891
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:49,136
gifts that are given from above.

892
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,680
So why do you do it?

893
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:54,141
You don't have to do it.

894
00:51:55,477 --> 00:51:58,020
Please don't drink.

895
00:51:58,104 --> 00:51:59,605
Please.

896
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:02,357
I won't drink.

897
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:05,944
- You won't drink anymore?
- No.

898
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:10,866
- Give me your word of honor.
- I give it.

899
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,326
Thank you.

900
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,911
Basta! Eh?

901
00:52:15,455 --> 00:52:18,290
- Look at that. I've sobered up.

902
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:20,209
Sober already...

903
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:23,337
and I shall stay so,
as I have vowed...

904
00:52:23,421 --> 00:52:25,380
till the end of my days.

905
00:52:31,054 --> 00:52:32,554
Well -

906
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:37,309
So -

907
00:52:39,437 --> 00:52:42,689
My time has passed.

908
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,608
I'm old. I'm jaded.

909
00:52:45,777 --> 00:52:47,444
I'm overworked.

910
00:52:48,571 --> 00:52:50,572
My feelings are blunt.

911
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:54,409
I have lost capacity for all attachment.

912
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:58,455
What attracts me?

913
00:52:59,624 --> 00:53:02,543
What attracts me?
Beauty attracts me.

914
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:06,338
I can't remain indifferent to it.

915
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:09,800
Yelena, for example, you see,
she'd turn my head in a day.

916
00:53:11,594 --> 00:53:13,720
But then...

917
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:15,806
it's not love, now, is it?

918
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,647
What is it?

919
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:26,567
- It's nothing.
- No, what is it?

920
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:29,486
Oh, you know, in Lent I had a patient die
under the chloroform.

921
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:31,822
- It's time you forgot that.
- Mmm.

922
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:36,493
- Can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

923
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:38,745
Um...

924
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:42,124
if I had a friend...

925
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:45,502
or a younger sister, let's say...

926
00:53:45,587 --> 00:53:48,881
and then if you found out...

927
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:50,883
that this girl...

928
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:53,719
loved you...

929
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:55,762
then...

930
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:58,348
how would that make you feel?

931
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:01,685
I have no idea.
I suspect that I wouldn't feel a thing.

932
00:54:02,687 --> 00:54:04,521
You'd feel nothing?

933
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:11,153
I think what I think
is that I'd give her to understand...

934
00:54:11,237 --> 00:54:13,947
how I could never love her.

935
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:17,743
Uh, could you perhaps ask me this later?

936
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:20,204
If I'm to go, I must go.

937
00:54:20,288 --> 00:54:22,206
And now is the time.

938
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,293
Farewell, my dove.

939
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:31,924
If we keep talking, we'll be talking at noon.

940
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:33,508
Good-bye.

941
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:47,773
He's told me nothing, and yet I'm happy.

942
00:54:51,236 --> 00:54:53,987
He keeps his heart and his soul from me...

943
00:54:55,323 --> 00:54:57,616
yet I'm happy and I don't care.

944
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:04,665
"A beautiful man," I said.
"You have a lovely voice."

945
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:06,667
Was that forward?

946
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:11,672
I don't care.
I - I love his voice. Why shouldn't I?

947
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:16,760
And yet...

948
00:55:16,844 --> 00:55:19,763
I told him about my friend.

949
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:22,516
Oh! "A younger sister," I said...

950
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,018
and he didn't get a word.

951
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:35,195
Lord...

952
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,781
why did you make me so plain?

953
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:46,248
Last week in church,
I heard the woman behind me.

954
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:51,878
"She's so kind and generous.

955
00:55:51,963 --> 00:55:54,214
What a pity she's so plain.

956
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,261
That she's so plain."

957
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:05,475
End of the storm.

958
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:15,319
Such a peace in the air.

959
00:56:22,243 --> 00:56:24,411
- Where's the doctor?
- Gone.

960
00:56:25,663 --> 00:56:26,997
- Sophie.
- What?

961
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,750
How long are you going to go on
being short with me?

962
00:56:32,837 --> 00:56:35,839
We've done no harm to each other.
Why should we be enemies?

963
00:56:38,634 --> 00:56:40,302
Don't you feel -

964
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:43,680
Enough.

965
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:45,349
- I -
- Yes?

966
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:48,101
- I wanted to.
- I did too.

967
00:56:51,189 --> 00:56:54,107
Well, let's not be angry anymore then.

968
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:57,194
With all my heart.

969
00:57:00,865 --> 00:57:02,949
That's good.

970
00:57:03,034 --> 00:57:04,534
Thank you.

971
00:57:06,662 --> 00:57:08,830
Has Papa gone to bed yet?

972
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:12,626
No.

973
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,419
He's still sitting up.

974
00:57:15,421 --> 00:57:19,383
Weeks at a time we don't talk to each other.
God only knows why.

975
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:28,058
Drink with me.

976
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:34,147
Bräderschaft.

977
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,317
Out of the same glass.

978
00:57:57,755 --> 00:58:02,259
I wanted to make it up for a long time,
and I felt ashamed.

979
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:05,262
Why are you crying?

980
00:58:05,346 --> 00:58:06,930
It's nothing.

981
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:11,935
You're angry with me...

982
00:58:12,979 --> 00:58:16,606
because you think I married your father
for my own convenience.

983
00:58:19,402 --> 00:58:21,987
If you believe in oaths...

984
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:24,072
I give you my oath on this:

985
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:27,075
I married him for love.

986
00:58:28,286 --> 00:58:32,289
He was a famous man,
a man of learning...

987
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:34,374
and I was captivated by it.

988
00:58:35,543 --> 00:58:37,502
And it was not real.

989
00:58:39,297 --> 00:58:41,214
The love was not real...

990
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,718
but I thought it was real.

991
00:58:46,012 --> 00:58:49,848
At the time I thought it was real,
and I'm not to blame.

992
00:58:51,476 --> 00:58:54,728
But, Sophie, ever since our wedding day,
you haven't stopped accusing me.

993
00:58:54,812 --> 00:58:56,480
- I accused you?
- You did.

994
00:58:56,564 --> 00:58:59,483
I saw it... in your eyes.

995
00:58:59,567 --> 00:59:01,401
We'll have no more of that.

996
00:59:01,486 --> 00:59:03,612
You mustn't look like that on people.

997
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:06,156
It doesn't suit you.

998
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:10,243
And we must trust.

999
00:59:11,496 --> 00:59:13,830
How can we live if we do not?

1000
00:59:18,044 --> 00:59:21,296
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

1001
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:24,674
- But honestly, as a friend.
- Yes.

1002
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,094
Are you happy?

1003
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:29,763
No.

1004
00:59:31,432 --> 00:59:33,517
- I knew you weren't.

1005
00:59:36,729 --> 00:59:39,189
And can I ask you something else?

1006
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,611
Wouldn't you have preferred
to marry a younger husband?

1007
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:47,072
Oh, what a schoolgirl you are.

1008
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:49,157
- Well, wouldn't you have?
- Yes.

1009
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:55,497
Yes, I should have liked that.

1010
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:57,541
All right. What else?

1011
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:03,129
Um, do you like the doctor?

1012
01:00:03,214 --> 01:00:04,673
Very much.

1013
01:00:04,757 --> 01:00:06,967
- Do I look funny?
- Mm-mmm.

1014
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:10,971
Uh! It's - It's just that
even though he's not here...

1015
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:13,974
I can still hear his voice.

1016
01:00:14,058 --> 01:00:17,602
And if I look over by the window,
I can see him there.

1017
01:00:18,396 --> 01:00:20,313
God, let me say it!

1018
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:23,650
Oh, my God. I shouldn't talk so loud.
Should we go to my room?

1019
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:26,486
Do I seem silly to you?

1020
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:29,239
Ugh. Of course I do.
Tell me about him.

1021
01:00:29,323 --> 01:00:32,492
- What should I tell?
- Isn't he so clever? Isn't he?

1022
01:00:32,577 --> 01:00:36,329
Beyond that, he does things.
He heals people, and he plants.

1023
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:39,833
- Oh, my dear, it's so much more than that.
- It is?

1024
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:41,668
He plants a tree,
and when he plants it...

1025
01:00:41,752 --> 01:00:45,171
he's - he's trying to see what comes
of his action in a thousand years.

1026
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:49,009
A thousand years. Do you know?
He's thinking of the happiness of man.

1027
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:51,678
- When you find such beautiful people -
- What?

1028
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:54,306
They must... be loved.

1029
01:00:56,934 --> 01:00:59,603
- He drinks.
- Yes, he does.

1030
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:01,187
He can be coarse.

1031
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:05,859
When you think of his life,
he ministers to crude, barbarous folk.

1032
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:09,404
Their poverty, their ignorance
around him constantly -

1033
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:10,905
disease.

1034
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,492
A man who lives this life -

1035
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:19,289
I wish you this happiness.

1036
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,626
With all my soul.

1037
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:25,754
You deserve happiness.

1038
01:01:27,465 --> 01:01:30,300
I am a dull, second-rank character, you know.

1039
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:34,638
Throughout my whole life,
that's what I've been.

1040
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:37,891
When you come to think of it,
I am quite thoroughly unhappy.

1041
01:01:37,975 --> 01:01:39,809
- Why are you laughing?

1042
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:41,436
I feel so happy.

1043
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,939
- Would you like me to play for you?
- Yes! Very much.

1044
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:46,733
- Yes?
- Yes. I can't sleep.

1045
01:01:46,817 --> 01:01:49,861
Good. Go ask your father.

1046
01:01:49,945 --> 01:01:54,741
When he's ill, music sometimes upsets him.
If it's all right, then I'll play.

1047
01:01:55,576 --> 01:01:57,077
All right.

1048
01:02:35,408 --> 01:02:36,825
Oh.

1049
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:41,788
So long since I've played.

1050
01:02:41,872 --> 01:02:44,708
I'll play and then I'll cry
like some damned fool.

1051
01:02:54,468 --> 01:02:56,678
He says we can't.

1052
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:09,983
Okay. Let's take a little break.

1053
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:21,870
It used to be so nice when you smoked too.
Now I'm the only one.

1054
01:03:21,954 --> 01:03:23,538
Sorry, Jer.

1055
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:28,334
You know, I love to go to Milwaukee.
They have wonderful restaurants there.

1056
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:29,669
- Right.
- Yes.

1057
01:03:29,754 --> 01:03:34,507
- Did you find anyplace good to eat in Hartford?
- No. Max's on Main.

1058
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,054
- Do you know I have an Indian guru?
- You do?

1059
01:03:40,139 --> 01:03:42,432
Yes, Gurumayi is a great teacher.

1060
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:46,186
So, anyway, the, uh, next two acts...

1061
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:50,064
take place three months later, in September.

1062
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:52,942
So you can just imagine that all the things
that have been going on...

1063
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:55,111
have been going on for three more months.

1064
01:04:23,098 --> 01:04:27,769
The Herr Professor has been so good
as to express this -

1065
01:04:27,853 --> 01:04:30,563
He wishes that we should gather here
in this drawing room...

1066
01:04:30,648 --> 01:04:32,732
at 1:00 this afternoon.

1067
01:04:32,817 --> 01:04:34,734
That'll be in one-quarter hour...

1068
01:04:34,819 --> 01:04:37,612
at which time he has some thing...

1069
01:04:37,696 --> 01:04:39,572
which he wishes to share with the world.

1070
01:04:39,657 --> 01:04:41,741
Some business matter probably.

1071
01:04:41,826 --> 01:04:43,910
But what business? He has none anymore.

1072
01:04:43,994 --> 01:04:47,413
He writes garbage, he grumbles,
he envies the world, and that's his life.

1073
01:04:47,498 --> 01:04:50,250
- Uncle!
- All right. All right.

1074
01:04:50,334 --> 01:04:52,585
You're right.

1075
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,422
Oh, look at how she moves.

1076
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:58,591
Morbid with laziness.

1077
01:04:58,676 --> 01:05:01,094
A panorama of inaction.

1078
01:05:01,178 --> 01:05:04,681
Must you go on always?
Is there nothing to do?

1079
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:07,267
I'm dying of boredom.

1080
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:10,144
There's no end of things to do,
if you wish to do them.

1081
01:05:10,229 --> 01:05:14,232
- Tell me one.
- Teach, treat the sick, care for the estate.

1082
01:05:14,316 --> 01:05:16,484
- Hmm.
- Much to do. When you and Papa weren't here...

1083
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:19,028
Uncle and I used to
go to the market to sell flour.

1084
01:05:20,114 --> 01:05:21,781
I wouldn't know how.

1085
01:05:21,866 --> 01:05:24,367
Eh -

1086
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:26,703
Besides, it doesn't interest me.

1087
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:32,125
In ideological novels, people always jump up
and declare that they'll teach or treat the sick.

1088
01:05:32,209 --> 01:05:34,460
But how should I do that?
Just suddenly - Just -

1089
01:05:34,545 --> 01:05:37,797
I- If - If you did it, you'd be drawn to it.
You would.

1090
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:41,968
I know you're bored. It's so contagious.
Uncle Vanya has it now.

1091
01:05:42,052 --> 01:05:46,723
He does nothing except follow you
like a cloud on a leash all day long.

1092
01:05:46,807 --> 01:05:49,767
I put down my work,
and I come to chat.

1093
01:05:49,852 --> 01:05:51,978
I've grown so lazy.

1094
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:55,440
And our doctor, who used to
come here once a month, if that...

1095
01:05:55,524 --> 01:05:56,983
is here every single day...

1096
01:05:57,067 --> 01:06:01,654
and turns his back on his forests
and his medicine and lives under your spell.

1097
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:06,409
But... why are you languishing, my dear,
my splendor?

1098
01:06:07,578 --> 01:06:09,078
Wake up!

1099
01:06:09,163 --> 01:06:11,456
Pulse with life!

1100
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:16,502
You, when the blood of mermaids
courses through your veins...

1101
01:06:16,587 --> 01:06:19,505
wake up to your mermaid life.

1102
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:23,259
For once in your life, let yourself go.

1103
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:26,512
Rise to the heights...

1104
01:06:26,597 --> 01:06:30,516
and then plunge into the frothy brine.

1105
01:06:31,852 --> 01:06:34,604
Love with a water spirit awaits you...

1106
01:06:34,688 --> 01:06:37,857
in your guise as the naiad of perfection...

1107
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:40,985
so that our Herr Professor and all of us...

1108
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:44,447
can just throw back our heads and say...

1109
01:06:44,531 --> 01:06:46,199
"Who was that nymph?"

1110
01:06:46,283 --> 01:06:48,117
Will you shut up?

1111
01:06:49,161 --> 01:06:51,412
It's very cruel.

1112
01:06:51,497 --> 01:06:54,040
Forgive me, my joy. Forgive me.

1113
01:06:54,124 --> 01:06:56,793
I apologize.

1114
01:06:58,128 --> 01:07:01,589
- Forgive me. Peace.
- You'd try the patience of a saint.

1115
01:07:01,674 --> 01:07:04,175
- Hmm, as a peace offering -
- Admit it!

1116
01:07:04,259 --> 01:07:07,470
As an offering of peace,
I am going to bring you...

1117
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:10,390
a bouquet of roses!

1118
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:15,144
Flowers which I had the foresight
to have obtained this morning.

1119
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,232
Sad roses.

1120
01:07:19,316 --> 01:07:21,109
Autumn roses.

1121
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:23,861
For you.

1122
01:07:28,575 --> 01:07:31,244
Sad autumn roses.

1123
01:07:34,456 --> 01:07:36,416
It's already September.

1124
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:39,669
How are we gonna get through the winter here?

1125
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,049
Where's the doctor?

1126
01:07:45,134 --> 01:07:48,428
He's up in Uncle Vanya's room.
He's writing something.

1127
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,020
I'm glad Uncle's gone,
'cause I wanted to talk to you.

1128
01:07:58,355 --> 01:07:59,897
About what?

1129
01:08:00,899 --> 01:08:03,192
- "About what?"

1130
01:08:08,032 --> 01:08:09,699
I'm ugly.

1131
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:14,829
Oh, you have beautiful hair,
and you have beautiful eyes -

1132
01:08:14,913 --> 01:08:18,791
No. The unattractive woman
is told that she has beautiful hair...

1133
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:21,002
and beautiful eyes.

1134
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:27,925
I've loved him for six years.

1135
01:08:28,802 --> 01:08:31,763
I love him more than I love my own mother.

1136
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:36,642
I always hear his voice,
and I always feel his hand on my hand.

1137
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:40,605
And I always - always look at the door,
like at any moment and -

1138
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:45,109
I keep coming to you about him.
And he's here. He looks right through me.

1139
01:08:47,738 --> 01:08:51,783
All night long, I pray.
I know I have no hope.

1140
01:08:51,867 --> 01:08:53,743
Yesterday, I confessed to Uncle Vanya.

1141
01:08:53,827 --> 01:08:56,496
All the servants know I love him.
Everybody knows.

1142
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,498
What does he think?

1143
01:08:58,582 --> 01:09:01,334
He doesn't notice me.

1144
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:03,836
Well, he's a strange man.

1145
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,839
Why not let me approach him?
What do you think?

1146
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:08,549
I'll be discreet.

1147
01:09:09,718 --> 01:09:11,761
A most gentle hint.

1148
01:09:12,554 --> 01:09:15,223
Really, how long are you to live in uncertainty?

1149
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:19,102
He loves you, or he doesn't.
Yes or no.

1150
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:22,939
If it's no...

1151
01:09:23,023 --> 01:09:25,149
then let him stop coming here.

1152
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:27,568
Yes?

1153
01:09:29,947 --> 01:09:32,115
He said he would show me his maps.

1154
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,870
Tell him that I want him.

1155
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:41,999
And you'll tell me the truth?

1156
01:09:42,084 --> 01:09:44,752
Oh, I will because...

1157
01:09:44,837 --> 01:09:47,380
I think the truth,
no matter how bad...

1158
01:09:47,464 --> 01:09:50,133
is always better than an uncertainty.

1159
01:09:50,968 --> 01:09:52,593
I promise you.

1160
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:12,655
Not knowing is better
because then at least there's hope.

1161
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:15,366
- What's that?
- Nothing.

1162
01:10:21,123 --> 01:10:22,623
Lord...

1163
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:28,045
what's worse than knowing someone's secret
and standing by powerless?

1164
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:31,632
Clearly the man cares nothing for her.

1165
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:35,553
Why shouldn't he take her?

1166
01:10:35,637 --> 01:10:38,264
A country doctor his age?

1167
01:10:38,348 --> 01:10:41,684
A kind, pure, intelligent girl.

1168
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:45,062
What's wrong with her for a wife?

1169
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:47,690
Nothing.

1170
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:51,360
Not a thing.

1171
01:10:53,697 --> 01:10:55,573
Poor child.

1172
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,578
Live in a gray world like this,
hear nothing but the banal every day.

1173
01:11:00,662 --> 01:11:02,914
Then this man appears.

1174
01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:06,042
A handsome man.

1175
01:11:07,377 --> 01:11:09,545
A captivating man.

1176
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:12,924
To yield...

1177
01:11:13,008 --> 01:11:14,717
to such a man.

1178
01:11:17,596 --> 01:11:20,014
Vanya said,
"Mermaid's blood runs in your veins.

1179
01:11:20,098 --> 01:11:22,308
For once in your life, let yourself go."

1180
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:26,938
Oh, should I not do that?

1181
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:31,108
For once in my life?

1182
01:11:32,236 --> 01:11:34,820
For once in my life,
when the man comes here every day...

1183
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:37,740
and every day
I know the reason why he comes.

1184
01:11:37,824 --> 01:11:39,533
Oh, God.

1185
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,578
I'm stained already.

1186
01:11:43,372 --> 01:11:47,333
I should fall on my knees to Sonya
and beg her forgiveness.

1187
01:11:52,506 --> 01:11:56,592
Good morning.

1188
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:59,595
You wanted -
You wanted to see my drawings.

1189
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:04,392
Uh, yesterday, you said you had some maps
you were working on?

1190
01:12:04,476 --> 01:12:06,811
- Yes, I have them.
- Are you free?

1191
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:08,396
I am.

1192
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:11,774
Um -

1193
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:14,902
Uh, where were you born?

1194
01:12:15,862 --> 01:12:17,989
Uh, in Petersburg.

1195
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:20,866
- And where did you study?
- In the conservatory.

1196
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:23,286
Mm-hmm. You may find
that this won't interest you.

1197
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,454
No? Why not?

1198
01:12:27,082 --> 01:12:29,125
- It's true, I don't know the country.
- Uh-huh.

1199
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:30,960
The, um...

1200
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,005
topography.

1201
01:12:34,089 --> 01:12:35,381
Indeed.

1202
01:12:35,465 --> 01:12:36,966
But I've read a great deal. I -

1203
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:40,970
I have my own worktable in Vanya's room, and
when I'm on the point of extreme exhaustion...

1204
01:12:41,054 --> 01:12:44,765
I steal away to spend
an hour or two over my maps.

1205
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:47,601
Vanya and Sophie working away
at the accounts...

1206
01:12:47,686 --> 01:12:52,023
and I'm seated beside them
at my worktable, painting away.

1207
01:12:52,107 --> 01:12:55,234
And I'm warm. Everything's quiet.

1208
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:57,320
I'm at peace.

1209
01:12:57,404 --> 01:12:59,238
I hear the crickets outside.

1210
01:12:59,323 --> 01:13:00,948
Totally at peace.

1211
01:13:01,658 --> 01:13:03,242
Once a month perhaps.

1212
01:13:04,661 --> 01:13:06,162
All right.

1213
01:13:06,246 --> 01:13:09,665
Now this is our district
as it was 50 years ago.

1214
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,085
The greens indicate the forests.
As you see, half of the whole is wooded.

1215
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:16,964
Where we see the green crosshatched with red,
we have the range of elk and wild goats.

1216
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:18,966
I show both flora and the fauna here.

1217
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:21,552
On the lakes,
there were swans, geese, ducks...

1218
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:25,348
and, as the old folks say,
"a power of birds," they would say.

1219
01:13:26,266 --> 01:13:29,310
We have the villages and hamlets,
and here and there the various small farms.

1220
01:13:29,394 --> 01:13:32,188
Outposts, religious encampments, water mills -

1221
01:13:32,272 --> 01:13:34,732
Much cattle, and horses.
These are marked with blue.

1222
01:13:34,816 --> 01:13:38,652
There were great herds here.
Each household kept, on the average, 12 horses.

1223
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:40,237
Now, here...

1224
01:13:42,074 --> 01:13:43,741
25 years have passed.

1225
01:13:43,825 --> 01:13:47,578
Now already we see that only
one-third of the area is timbered.

1226
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,622
The goats are gone.
We still see elk occasionally...

1227
01:13:49,706 --> 01:13:53,292
but the blues and greens are vanishing
and, uh, so on.

1228
01:13:53,377 --> 01:13:57,922
As we go down to the third rendition
where we see the district as it is today...

1229
01:13:58,006 --> 01:13:59,465
there's no solid green.

1230
01:13:59,549 --> 01:14:03,677
The elk and swans and geese have disappeared.
There's no sign of the old settlements.

1231
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:06,305
In short, here's a perfect picture
of a gradual and relentless decay...

1232
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,808
which, in 10 or 12 more years...

1233
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:11,143
will be totally complete,
and the land will be dead.

1234
01:14:11,228 --> 01:14:14,146
So you say, fine.
You say deep cultural influences are at work...

1235
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:17,191
and that the old life
must naturally give way to the new.

1236
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:19,902
And I would agree with you
if in place of decimated forests...

1237
01:14:19,986 --> 01:14:22,780
we had industry, railroads, schools.

1238
01:14:22,864 --> 01:14:25,157
If the populous were happier,
better employed, in better health.

1239
01:14:25,242 --> 01:14:28,160
But what do we have here?
We have the same swamps, the same mosquitoes...

1240
01:14:28,245 --> 01:14:33,207
the same lack of roads, the same typhus,
diphtheria, rickets - diseases of poverty.

1241
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:35,167
The same eternal fires.

1242
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:39,630
So that what we see is a struggle for existence
that is beyond human strength...

1243
01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:42,675
where we degenerate in ignorance and sloth.

1244
01:14:42,759 --> 01:14:45,302
And so man, freezing, starving, diseased -

1245
01:14:45,387 --> 01:14:48,139
Man, to preserve the last vestige of his life,
to save his children...

1246
01:14:48,223 --> 01:14:50,349
reaches out reflexively...

1247
01:14:50,434 --> 01:14:53,686
in his animal fear and destroys,
with no thought for tomorrow...

1248
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:59,108
so that nearly everything is destroyed
and nothing new brought into being.

1249
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:01,444
And I see this doesn't interest you.

1250
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:06,407
- I understand so little of it.
- Ah.

1251
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:09,577
But aside from that though,
it holds no interest for you.

1252
01:15:10,704 --> 01:15:14,540
- In - In truth, my mind was on other things.
- I see.

1253
01:15:14,624 --> 01:15:16,125
- Forgive me.
- Not at all.

1254
01:15:16,209 --> 01:15:19,962
And what preoccupied me - was -

1255
01:15:21,673 --> 01:15:24,633
- In fact, I don't know how to begin.
- Please.

1256
01:15:25,969 --> 01:15:28,554
- It was an interrogation.
- An interrogation?

1257
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:31,390
Yes, a harmless one.

1258
01:15:31,475 --> 01:15:33,893
If I may.

1259
01:15:33,977 --> 01:15:35,478
Will you sit down?

1260
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:45,029
This matter concerns
a certain friend of mine...

1261
01:15:46,114 --> 01:15:47,740
a young friend.

1262
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:51,744
May we speak frankly?

1263
01:15:51,828 --> 01:15:53,746
Of course.

1264
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:56,457
And the things we say, we never spoke of.

1265
01:15:57,501 --> 01:15:59,668
- Do you understand?
- I do.

1266
01:16:01,963 --> 01:16:04,757
The matter concerns my stepdaughter, Sonya.

1267
01:16:06,092 --> 01:16:07,676
Yes?

1268
01:16:09,012 --> 01:16:11,597
How do you feel about her?

1269
01:16:14,976 --> 01:16:16,769
I respect her.

1270
01:16:18,522 --> 01:16:21,106
Your feelings for her as a woman?

1271
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:25,444
- My feelings for her -
- Yes.

1272
01:16:25,529 --> 01:16:27,154
I have none.

1273
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:30,157
Ah. Uh-huh.

1274
01:16:30,242 --> 01:16:32,034
Um -

1275
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:35,329
Two more words, and I'm done.

1276
01:16:36,373 --> 01:16:39,625
Have you perhaps remarked
her attitude toward you?

1277
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:41,126
No.

1278
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:47,466
Well, then I'm done.

1279
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:51,011
You don't love Sonya...

1280
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:53,847
and you will not.

1281
01:16:57,978 --> 01:17:00,437
Now, she's suffering...

1282
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:02,565
and I must ask your compassion...

1283
01:17:03,733 --> 01:17:05,651
that you not come here anymore.

1284
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:10,114
Uh-huh.

1285
01:17:16,162 --> 01:17:18,789
Well, it's late. I see I've stayed, um -

1286
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:25,588
- I really don't have the time to come here.
- Oh, Lord, what a sordid... interview.

1287
01:17:25,672 --> 01:17:29,341
Well, it's done.
And we never spoke of it at all.

1288
01:17:29,426 --> 01:17:31,969
And now you must go.

1289
01:17:32,053 --> 01:17:33,554
You see that.

1290
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:38,601
- If only one month ago, you had approached me -
- No.

1291
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:40,269
Yes. Then I might have considered it.

1292
01:17:40,353 --> 01:17:43,022
And if she's suffering, of course -

1293
01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:45,774
I mean, if the poor girl's suffering, I, um -

1294
01:17:47,277 --> 01:17:48,819
Um -

1295
01:17:50,363 --> 01:17:52,364
I understand.

1296
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:54,325
You understand what?

1297
01:17:55,368 --> 01:17:59,455
To belabor the obvious,
you call me here for an interrogation...

1298
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:01,790
and I walk into your trap, didn't I?

1299
01:18:05,337 --> 01:18:07,963
"What do you feel as a man?

1300
01:18:08,048 --> 01:18:10,549
Could we know your true feelings?"

1301
01:18:10,634 --> 01:18:13,802
All right, I'll tell you,
and without the charade.

1302
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:16,889
I confess it.

1303
01:18:18,016 --> 01:18:21,602
- I'm yours. I surrender.
- Are you out of your mind?

1304
01:18:21,686 --> 01:18:24,521
I've confessed it.
Your sweet ruse has forced it out of me.

1305
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:26,899
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm better than you think.

1306
01:18:26,983 --> 01:18:30,569
- I'm nobler than you think, I swear it to you.
- All right. I'll take my leave of you.

1307
01:18:30,654 --> 01:18:33,280
This is the last time. Where shall we meet?
Quickly, say it.

1308
01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:34,948
- And one kiss.
- I swear to God!

1309
01:18:35,033 --> 01:18:37,743
- How beautiful you are. Your face -
- No, please. Please go away.

1310
01:18:37,827 --> 01:18:39,453
- You tell me where we're gonna meet tomorrow.
- No!

1311
01:18:39,537 --> 01:18:41,664
- It's over. It's decided.
- Please leave me.

1312
01:18:41,748 --> 01:18:43,832
By the orchard, 2:00. Yes?

1313
01:18:49,673 --> 01:18:52,049
Let me go. Let me -

1314
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:53,634
Oh, God.

1315
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,977
Very well.

1316
01:19:04,062 --> 01:19:05,771
Never mind it.

1317
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:24,748
Today, my dear friend -

1318
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:28,961
The weather -

1319
01:19:29,045 --> 01:19:32,840
Wouldn't you say the weather,
which looked so cloudy formerly...

1320
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:37,136
is changed and the sun's out...

1321
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,222
in what we must say
has turned into a splendid afternoon?

1322
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:45,894
The winter crop's quite good actually.

1323
01:19:45,979 --> 01:19:47,896
The only mark against it is...

1324
01:19:48,898 --> 01:19:51,024
the days grow short and -

1325
01:19:53,194 --> 01:19:55,404
What can anyone do about that?

1326
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:08,333
I would entreat you...

1327
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:09,752
please...

1328
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:15,716
to exercise all of your influence
to see that my husband and I...

1329
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,385
quit this place at once.

1330
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:21,096
This afternoon.

1331
01:20:22,265 --> 01:20:24,767
- Do you hear?
- Yes.

1332
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:29,897
Did you hear what I said?

1333
01:20:29,981 --> 01:20:33,358
You know, I - I -
I saw this whole thing.

1334
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:35,569
I -

1335
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:40,866
Tell me you -

1336
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,910
Heard what I said.

1337
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:47,039
We're leaving here today.

1338
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,547
You know, Your Excellency,
I myself have been feeling...

1339
01:20:55,632 --> 01:20:58,133
particularly other than well of late.

1340
01:20:58,218 --> 01:21:00,719
Although in my case it's my head.

1341
01:21:00,804 --> 01:21:03,847
- My head in particular has been feeling -
- Where are the others?

1342
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:06,391
Where are they? I hate this house.

1343
01:21:06,476 --> 01:21:10,437
Why should I live in a labyrinth?
Twenty-six rooms, everybody wandering -

1344
01:21:10,522 --> 01:21:12,439
Please ask Maman to come in here.

1345
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:16,318
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

1346
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:21,365
- What did he say?
- Oh, not now.

1347
01:21:21,449 --> 01:21:22,950
What is it?

1348
01:21:24,577 --> 01:21:28,413
I simply cannot learn to live the country life.

1349
01:21:28,498 --> 01:21:32,417
- He won't be coming here anymore, is that it?

1350
01:21:32,502 --> 01:21:35,003
- Tell it to me. Yes?
- Sonya.

1351
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,924
Sonya!

1352
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:43,679
Fine, she ignores me.
Oh, Nurse, would you come in too, please?

1353
01:21:44,514 --> 01:21:47,599
And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you would...

1354
01:21:47,684 --> 01:21:51,270
like the sunflower, turn your attentive heads.

1355
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:53,605
- Here is Maman.

1356
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:57,109
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

1357
01:21:57,902 --> 01:22:01,697
"I've summoned you here, citizens,
to inform you that the inspector general...

1358
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:03,991
has chosen to pay us a visit."

1359
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:09,580
Uh, joking aside then, and in a serious vein...

1360
01:22:09,664 --> 01:22:14,001
I've asked you here for your help and advice
in the full hope that I shall receive them.

1361
01:22:14,878 --> 01:22:17,754
I'm a scholar, a man of books.

1362
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:20,799
I've long been a stranger to the intricacies...

1363
01:22:20,884 --> 01:22:23,468
the vicissitudes of the business life.

1364
01:22:23,553 --> 01:22:27,514
I cannot live without
the help and guidance of practical folk.

1365
01:22:27,599 --> 01:22:29,224
So, I've asked you...

1366
01:22:29,934 --> 01:22:32,853
Ivan Petrovich, Yelena...

1367
01:22:32,937 --> 01:22:34,813
Ilya llych -

1368
01:22:34,898 --> 01:22:37,274
- Maman.
- Ah.

1369
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:40,319
An old man, not a well man.

1370
01:22:40,403 --> 01:22:45,157
A man who knows from his age -
manet omnes una nox -

1371
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:46,408
Uh-huh.

1372
01:22:46,492 --> 01:22:49,411
That time and tide happens to us all.

1373
01:22:50,747 --> 01:22:53,582
- My life is finished.
- Oh.

1374
01:22:54,417 --> 01:22:56,001
But I possess a young wife...

1375
01:22:56,085 --> 01:22:59,838
and for us to continue living in the country
is simply not possible.

1376
01:22:59,923 --> 01:23:03,008
We are not made to live the country life.

1377
01:23:03,092 --> 01:23:05,344
Nor can we live in town...

1378
01:23:05,428 --> 01:23:09,181
on an income of the magnitude
this estate provides.

1379
01:23:10,183 --> 01:23:13,143
We could sell the forest.

1380
01:23:15,146 --> 01:23:17,230
A measure both extreme and nonrenewable.

1381
01:23:17,315 --> 01:23:19,733
For once sold, it yields no more income.

1382
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:24,655
So where can we seek to find a strategy
that provides...

1383
01:23:24,739 --> 01:23:29,952
both a definite and still
a permanent source of income?

1384
01:23:30,954 --> 01:23:33,538
I have sought for and, I think,
found that strategy...

1385
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:35,874
and now have the honor
of presenting it to you.

1386
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,711
In broad strokes, in general principle...

1387
01:23:39,796 --> 01:23:44,216
our estate yields
on the average two percent.

1388
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:45,717
I propose to sell it.

1389
01:23:45,802 --> 01:23:49,638
If we sell the estate
and invest in interest-bearing bonds...

1390
01:23:49,722 --> 01:23:51,556
we receive four to five percent.

1391
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:54,017
Four to five!

1392
01:23:54,102 --> 01:23:56,728
And I think there'll be enough surplus...

1393
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:59,564
to purchase a villa in Finland!

1394
01:24:00,525 --> 01:24:04,778
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh, would you repeat what you said?

1395
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:09,574
I will, with the proceeds,
invest in interest-bearing bonds...

1396
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:11,910
and with whatever residue there is...

1397
01:24:11,995 --> 01:24:14,413
purchase a small home in Finland.

1398
01:24:14,497 --> 01:24:15,872
Yes.

1399
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:20,419
No, not the Finland part.
You - You said the proceeds.

1400
01:24:20,503 --> 01:24:22,671
The proceeds of what?

1401
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:24,256
My sale of the estate.

1402
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,759
Ah, yes.
You see, now that was the thing...

1403
01:24:27,844 --> 01:24:29,845
that caught my attention.

1404
01:24:31,222 --> 01:24:33,765
You're going to sell the estate?

1405
01:24:35,435 --> 01:24:38,311
And -
Wh-where do I go?

1406
01:24:38,396 --> 01:24:40,981
And - And, uh - And Sonya here, please?

1407
01:24:41,065 --> 01:24:44,276
Uh, and my mother,
if I may be so picayune?

1408
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,945
Why, certainly. All in good time.

1409
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:49,823
- One cannot do everything at once.
- No, one cannot.

1410
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:53,368
You know, speaking of human ignorance...

1411
01:24:53,453 --> 01:24:57,330
I always supposed that this estate,
which you're going to sell, belonged to Sonya.

1412
01:24:57,415 --> 01:24:58,957
- No.
- If I may...

1413
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:03,045
as my late father purchased this estate
as a dowry for my sister...

1414
01:25:03,129 --> 01:25:06,298
so that it passed,
in my ignorance to look upon the law...

1415
01:25:06,382 --> 01:25:09,634
from my sister to Sonya,
to whom it belongs.

1416
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:11,762
- Certainly. Who denies it?
- Well -

1417
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:16,433
Of course, it belongs to Sonya, without whose
consent one would not think of selling it...

1418
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:19,644
and - and for whose benefit it shall be sold.

1419
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:23,899
Am I out of my mind? Am I raving?
Why are we listening to this? Why -

1420
01:25:23,983 --> 01:25:27,778
Please! Please don't contradict Alexandr!
Please!

1421
01:25:27,862 --> 01:25:31,865
Believe me,
he sees far better than we what is right.

1422
01:25:33,242 --> 01:25:36,119
Well, I'm going to have a drink of water.

1423
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:39,289
Then you just say...

1424
01:25:42,085 --> 01:25:43,585
whatever you wish to say.

1425
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:46,838
- You just -
- Why do you inflame yourself?

1426
01:25:47,757 --> 01:25:50,092
Do I say my plan is ideal?

1427
01:25:50,176 --> 01:25:52,928
It's a plan. Just a plan!

1428
01:25:53,012 --> 01:25:56,515
If it is found unsuitable, I shall discard it.

1429
01:25:57,517 --> 01:25:59,851
- Your Excellency -
- Yes.

1430
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:04,773
I myself have,
in addition to my reverence for your learning -

1431
01:26:04,857 --> 01:26:06,650
- Yes.
- A feeling of kinship...

1432
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:08,860
which brings me close to you.

1433
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:12,197
Now, my brother,
whom I think you know, Grigory llych -

1434
01:26:12,281 --> 01:26:15,700
Do you know his brother-in-law,
Fustian Trofich Lakidomov?

1435
01:26:15,785 --> 01:26:18,203
- He has a degree too -
- No, not now. Not now. Please!

1436
01:26:18,287 --> 01:26:20,455
- No, we're talking business!
- All right.

1437
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:22,040
Ask him.

1438
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:26,878
- What should I ask him?
- The estate was purchased from his uncle.

1439
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:30,757
- Was it not?
- Yes, it was, for the price at that time.

1440
01:26:30,842 --> 01:26:33,343
Yes, it was, for the price...

1441
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:36,388
of 95,000 rubles...

1442
01:26:36,472 --> 01:26:40,016
of which my father paid down 70...

1443
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:42,060
leaving a debt outstanding of -

1444
01:26:42,145 --> 01:26:43,645
Now are you following this?

1445
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:49,401
Because this estate
could not have been bought...

1446
01:26:49,485 --> 01:26:53,405
had I not renounced my share, you see,
of my inheritance...

1447
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:56,908
in favor of my sister, whom I dearly loved.

1448
01:26:56,993 --> 01:27:02,622
Additionally, had I not toiled like an ox
to discharge the remaining debt -

1449
01:27:02,707 --> 01:27:05,917
- I'm sorry I brought it up.
- Which stands free and clear...

1450
01:27:06,002 --> 01:27:09,421
thanks to me,
thanks to my efforts.

1451
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:14,217
And here you walk in here
and propose throwing me out in the snow.

1452
01:27:17,513 --> 01:27:20,307
I have managed the estate for 25 years.

1453
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:24,895
For 25 years I have worked,
I have sent you the money.

1454
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:27,272
During all that time, not once...

1455
01:27:27,356 --> 01:27:30,775
have you thought to think about the man
who worked for you!

1456
01:27:31,402 --> 01:27:33,069
Not once.

1457
01:27:34,906 --> 01:27:37,574
Twenty-five years, you have paid me...

1458
01:27:37,658 --> 01:27:42,537
the magnificent sum
of 500 rubles a year.

1459
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:45,457
500 rubles a year.

1460
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:49,294
And not once did it occur to you
that you might increase it.

1461
01:27:49,378 --> 01:27:53,924
Ivan Petrovich, I am not a practical man.
You could've raised it anytime you wanted.

1462
01:27:54,008 --> 01:27:57,510
Oh-ho, I see. I should've stolen!

1463
01:27:58,596 --> 01:28:02,307
And you despise me because I'm not a thief!

1464
01:28:02,391 --> 01:28:05,644
Yes, I should've stolen.
Then I wouldn't be a pauper today!

1465
01:28:05,728 --> 01:28:08,855
- Jean, please.
- Vanya, Vanya, words.

1466
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,483
Don't ruin good relations.

1467
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:15,153
I've lived like a mouse in the wall,
my mother and I.

1468
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:18,490
Our thoughts and our feelings
turned toward you.

1469
01:28:18,574 --> 01:28:21,993
Talked about your works,
we talked about our pride in you...

1470
01:28:22,078 --> 01:28:24,496
mentioned your name in awe.

1471
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:30,001
Our nights were spent
reading your periodicals...

1472
01:28:30,086 --> 01:28:33,088
your publications...

1473
01:28:33,172 --> 01:28:35,257
which now fill me with disgust.

1474
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:38,677
My eyes have opened now.
You write about art?

1475
01:28:38,761 --> 01:28:42,681
You understand nothing about art,
because you have no soul.

1476
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:45,934
You're a philistine, a fraud!

1477
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:49,437
- A swine feeding on the leavings of your betters.
- I beg you, stop it!

1478
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:51,022
- I'm leaving.
- You bilked us!

1479
01:28:51,107 --> 01:28:53,441
- I insist you stop -
- No, I won't stop! I won't!

1480
01:28:53,526 --> 01:28:57,654
Not finished! I have something else to say!
You ruined my life!

1481
01:28:57,738 --> 01:29:01,700
I lost the best years of my life for you,
you thief!

1482
01:29:01,784 --> 01:29:06,538
- You assassin, you ruined my life!
- I cannot - I-I'm going!

1483
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:09,374
What is it you want?

1484
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:12,168
And how can you speak to me that way?

1485
01:29:12,253 --> 01:29:14,254
What gives you the right?

1486
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,508
- You're nothing. Nothing!
- Ah.

1487
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,637
You want the estate...

1488
01:29:24,098 --> 01:29:26,141
it's yours.

1489
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:29,477
Take it.

1490
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:32,564
Take it! I've no need of it!

1491
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:37,736
I can't bear this hell! Do you hear me?
I can't bear it any longer! I'm leaving!

1492
01:29:38,362 --> 01:29:41,948
I've ruined it all.
I had talent, intelligence, courage!

1493
01:29:42,033 --> 01:29:44,409
- I could've been a Schopenhauer!

1494
01:29:44,493 --> 01:29:46,494
I could've been the new Dostoyevsky!

1495
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:48,913
- I could've designed a new philosophy!

1496
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:52,584
What am I saying?

1497
01:29:52,668 --> 01:29:55,545
Am I losing my mind? Maman.

1498
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:59,758
Maman. What is this pain, Maman?

1499
01:30:00,843 --> 01:30:03,053
Maman? Maman?

1500
01:30:04,513 --> 01:30:07,515
- Maman.
- Do as Alexandr says.

1501
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:12,228
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

1502
01:30:12,313 --> 01:30:14,773
All right. All right, all right!

1503
01:30:14,857 --> 01:30:16,775
I know. I know!

1504
01:30:19,487 --> 01:30:22,697
So... do you think you'll forget me?

1505
01:30:24,867 --> 01:30:27,535
Jean, please!

1506
01:30:28,496 --> 01:30:32,707
Jean! Jean. Please.

1507
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:35,001
Inform me. What is going on?

1508
01:30:35,086 --> 01:30:37,295
Take him away from me!

1509
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:40,465
Am I to live under the same roof with that?
He lives right here!

1510
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:43,635
I cannot live in the same house
with that man!

1511
01:30:43,719 --> 01:30:46,471
Take him away, or I shall have to leave,
and I tell you I will.

1512
01:30:46,555 --> 01:30:49,224
- We are leaving here today. Please.
- That nothing of a man!

1513
01:30:49,308 --> 01:30:52,477
May we start the arrangements, please?

1514
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:53,728
Papa.

1515
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:02,612
We are so unhappy, Uncle and I.

1516
01:31:04,949 --> 01:31:08,410
What about all the nights
that we worked for you? Do you remember?

1517
01:31:08,494 --> 01:31:10,995
We - We copied out your books for you.

1518
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:15,792
We translated your texts for you.
We worked without rest, Papa!

1519
01:31:15,876 --> 01:31:19,671
We didn't spend a penny on ourselves!
We sent it all to you.

1520
01:31:19,755 --> 01:31:24,175
We earned our bread.
I know - I know it's wrong, Papa.

1521
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:28,930
But please, Papa, just hear me
and try to understand us and be charitable.

1522
01:31:29,014 --> 01:31:31,516
Alexandr, have it all out with him.

1523
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,436
Have it all out with him now, I beg you.

1524
01:31:35,688 --> 01:31:38,106
- I beg you.
- Very well.

1525
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:40,859
- Thank you.
- I'll speak to him.

1526
01:31:42,236 --> 01:31:45,029
- Did I accuse him?
- No.

1527
01:31:45,114 --> 01:31:48,116
- What have I accused him of?
- Nothing.

1528
01:31:50,286 --> 01:31:52,871
I'm not angry with him, you understand.

1529
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:55,623
His actions - Uh -

1530
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:57,625
His actions towards me -

1531
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:02,380
One has to say, charitably...

1532
01:32:02,465 --> 01:32:03,965
they are strange.

1533
01:32:06,635 --> 01:32:08,219
I -

1534
01:32:08,304 --> 01:32:10,555
For your sake...

1535
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,223
I'll speak to him.

1536
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:30,909
Alexandr, be gentle with him.
Be calm. Try to calm him.

1537
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:39,918
- Oh. Oh.

1538
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:44,005
- Nanny!
- Oh, hush. Hush, my child.

1539
01:32:44,089 --> 01:32:47,550
Hush. The geese, they cackle.

1540
01:32:47,635 --> 01:32:50,929
The geese cackle, and then they stop.

1541
01:32:51,013 --> 01:32:53,640
- They cackle, and then they stop.

1542
01:32:53,724 --> 01:32:56,100
- Nanny!
- Aw!

1543
01:32:56,185 --> 01:32:59,437
Poor little orphan girl. You're trembling.

1544
01:32:59,522 --> 01:33:01,523
Are you cold?

1545
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:03,107
A little linden tea?

1546
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:07,445
- A little raspberries and tea, and it will pass.

1547
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:11,574
You geese, stop it!
Stop it now!

1548
01:33:12,701 --> 01:33:14,619
- Oh, God!

1549
01:33:14,703 --> 01:33:17,330
- Stop him!

1550
01:33:17,414 --> 01:33:19,749
- Stop him! He's gone mad!

1551
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,877
Give it to me! Give me the gun!

1552
01:33:24,797 --> 01:33:26,756
Damn this. Damn this.

1553
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,467
Take me away from here.
I can't stand it any longer.

1554
01:33:29,552 --> 01:33:32,220
- Oh, what do I think I'm doing?

1555
01:33:32,304 --> 01:33:33,763
Oh!

1556
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:49,696
If we're going to finish, we'd better hurry.

1557
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,073
Oh, there's not much left.

1558
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,744
- They'll be calling us soon.
- Mm-hmm.

1559
01:33:56,829 --> 01:33:59,330
- To say good-bye.
- Mm-hmm.

1560
01:33:59,415 --> 01:34:01,916
They've already sent for the horses.

1561
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:05,587
There's not much left.

1562
01:34:05,671 --> 01:34:09,382
You know, they're going to go to Kharkov...

1563
01:34:09,466 --> 01:34:12,677
- to live.
- Mm-hmm.

1564
01:34:14,096 --> 01:34:18,016
- Much better so.
- Mmm, yes. They've had a bad trauma here.

1565
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,893
- Well, we'll live again.
- Mmm.

1566
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:24,230
I know we will, as we used to...

1567
01:34:24,315 --> 01:34:27,066
in the old ways.

1568
01:34:27,151 --> 01:34:30,987
Tea at 7:00, dinner at 12:00.

1569
01:34:31,614 --> 01:34:35,992
And in the evening,
we'll sit down to supper as we used to do.

1570
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:38,745
As Christians.

1571
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:42,040
Ah, yes.

1572
01:34:42,124 --> 01:34:44,208
You know...

1573
01:34:44,293 --> 01:34:49,589
- I haven't had simple noodles for the longest time.

1574
01:34:49,673 --> 01:34:51,382
Black with sin as I am.

1575
01:34:51,467 --> 01:34:55,637
Well, it's a - it's a long time
since they gave us noodles, that's true.

1576
01:34:55,721 --> 01:34:58,973
It's been... quite a while.

1577
01:35:01,435 --> 01:35:04,437
There I was coming through
the village this morning...

1578
01:35:04,521 --> 01:35:07,065
and that shopkeeper yells out...

1579
01:35:07,149 --> 01:35:09,734
"Oh, look, there's the deadbeat.
Hey, freeloader!"

1580
01:35:09,818 --> 01:35:12,779
Oh, don't pay him any mind, my darling.

1581
01:35:12,863 --> 01:35:16,366
- We're all freeloaders under God.
- Mmm.

1582
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,868
Besides, you work.

1583
01:35:18,952 --> 01:35:22,288
Sonya works. Vanya works.

1584
01:35:22,373 --> 01:35:25,792
- Even me. Busy all the time.

1585
01:35:26,669 --> 01:35:28,294
Where is Sonya?

1586
01:35:28,379 --> 01:35:31,839
Oh, she went out into the garden
with the doctor, looking for Vanya.

1587
01:35:31,924 --> 01:35:33,424
- Are they -
- Well, yes.

1588
01:35:33,509 --> 01:35:36,469
They're afraid he's going to
lay hands on himself next.

1589
01:35:36,553 --> 01:35:40,264
- Oh. Where's his pistol?
- I hid it. It's in the root cellar.

1590
01:35:40,349 --> 01:35:41,808
- Shh!
- Mercy.

1591
01:35:46,188 --> 01:35:49,440
- Would you leave me, please?
- Oh.

1592
01:35:49,525 --> 01:35:51,025
Certainly.

1593
01:35:57,866 --> 01:35:59,867
Would you please leave?

1594
01:35:59,952 --> 01:36:02,036
For my part, with the greatest joy.

1595
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:04,163
Ought to have left a decent time ago.

1596
01:36:04,248 --> 01:36:07,625
As I said though, I will not do so
till you return what you took from me.

1597
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:10,336
- I took nothing from you.
- Uh-huh.

1598
01:36:11,839 --> 01:36:14,716
All right.
Mm-hmm.

1599
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,510
Well, if you wish, I'll sit here for a while.

1600
01:36:17,594 --> 01:36:20,388
And then, if you'll oblige me...

1601
01:36:20,472 --> 01:36:22,724
- subdue you and bind you and search you.

1602
01:36:22,808 --> 01:36:24,559
My word on it.

1603
01:36:28,897 --> 01:36:32,233
The worst of it, fool of the world...

1604
01:36:33,277 --> 01:36:36,529
is to have shot twice...

1605
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:39,657
and twice missed him.

1606
01:36:39,742 --> 01:36:42,744
If the mood for shooting struck you,
why not shoot yourself?

1607
01:36:44,246 --> 01:36:45,830
Myself? Mmm.

1608
01:36:47,207 --> 01:36:51,502
I'll tell you an oddity.
A man, myself, attempts a murder.

1609
01:36:51,587 --> 01:36:54,255
Do they arrest him? No. Now, why not?

1610
01:36:54,339 --> 01:36:57,049
Obviously, as I am regarded as insane.

1611
01:36:57,134 --> 01:37:00,344
- I am thought mad.
- Mmm.

1612
01:37:00,429 --> 01:37:04,557
But a man who cloaks his cruelty
and his heartlessness...

1613
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:06,768
and his swinishness, if you will -

1614
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:10,313
a man hides behind a veil
of false achievement -

1615
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:14,358
this wizard, this genius,
this exploiter is not mad.

1616
01:37:14,443 --> 01:37:17,236
And a young woman
who marries this old man...

1617
01:37:17,321 --> 01:37:19,947
and in the sight
of the entire world betrays him.

1618
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:23,367
I- I saw what you did.

1619
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:29,373
That's right. I did.

1620
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:33,878
And you can go to hell.

1621
01:37:33,962 --> 01:37:37,673
And you - you're not mad.

1622
01:37:37,758 --> 01:37:41,719
- It's the world that's mad to put up with you.
- Quite poetic.

1623
01:37:41,804 --> 01:37:45,389
Well, you see, I'm a madman,
so I'm not responsible.

1624
01:37:45,474 --> 01:37:47,266
- Uh-huh.
- I can say whatever I wish.

1625
01:37:47,351 --> 01:37:49,811
Well, you're not mad, you know.

1626
01:37:49,895 --> 01:37:51,479
You're a fool.

1627
01:37:52,564 --> 01:37:56,567
I used to think the foolish, the deranged...

1628
01:37:57,611 --> 01:37:59,070
the irresponsible are sick.

1629
01:37:59,154 --> 01:38:00,780
They're not sick. They're normal.

1630
01:38:00,864 --> 01:38:03,866
- You're quite well.
- Oh, God.

1631
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:07,662
- What am I going to do?
- Nothing.

1632
01:38:07,746 --> 01:38:11,415
I'm 47 years old.

1633
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,961
If I live to be 60,
I would have to live through...

1634
01:38:15,045 --> 01:38:17,588
13 more years.

1635
01:38:17,673 --> 01:38:20,091
How could I do that? How can I stand it?

1636
01:38:20,175 --> 01:38:23,386
I have nothing to do with those years, you see.

1637
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,847
Nothing.

1638
01:38:25,931 --> 01:38:31,435
I mean, if I could start anew, if I could live
the rest of my life out in some different way.

1639
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,856
If that were possible, as people do.

1640
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:38,609
To wake - To awaken each day and say...

1641
01:38:38,694 --> 01:38:40,945
"This is a new day."

1642
01:38:41,029 --> 01:38:44,448
If I could lose the past.
How could a person do that?

1643
01:38:44,533 --> 01:38:46,534
How could a person start anew
and begin a new life?

1644
01:38:46,618 --> 01:38:48,703
Oh, will you shut up?

1645
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:55,042
To start anew.

1646
01:38:56,545 --> 01:38:59,881
We cannot start anew, you or I.

1647
01:38:59,965 --> 01:39:03,593
This or that that we're living, you know, is our life.

1648
01:39:04,553 --> 01:39:06,554
- It is?
- Quite.

1649
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:12,143
People who live after us in 100 or in 200 years -
you know what they'll feel?

1650
01:39:12,227 --> 01:39:15,271
They'll despise us
for our stupid and insipid lives.

1651
01:39:15,355 --> 01:39:17,523
Perhaps they'll know how to be happy.

1652
01:39:18,275 --> 01:39:22,361
We, however - But for you and I
there is but one hope, and that hope is this:

1653
01:39:22,446 --> 01:39:25,740
That when we are dead, lying in our graves...

1654
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:29,285
visions may visit us
and that they are of peace.

1655
01:39:29,369 --> 01:39:31,162
- Oh, yes.

1656
01:39:32,581 --> 01:39:34,916
You know, my friend...

1657
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,046
we've said - in this district
we find but two decent, cultivated men...

1658
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:42,131
and we spoke of ourselves.

1659
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:46,886
But this last decade has undone us.

1660
01:39:46,970 --> 01:39:51,140
Life has sucked us in -
this foul, philistine life -

1661
01:39:52,434 --> 01:39:54,268
and it's corrupted us.

1662
01:39:55,562 --> 01:39:58,356
What a shocking surprise.

1663
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,524
We've turned out like the rest.

1664
01:40:03,862 --> 01:40:06,530
But we've changed the subject.
Give me back what you took.

1665
01:40:06,615 --> 01:40:07,782
I took nothing.

1666
01:40:07,866 --> 01:40:10,201
You took a large vial of morphine
from my medicine case.

1667
01:40:10,285 --> 01:40:13,537
If you intend on killing yourself,
take your gun and go off into the woods.

1668
01:40:13,622 --> 01:40:16,207
But give me back the drug,
or people will say I gave it to you.

1669
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:19,752
It's enough I'll have to pronounce you dead
and cut you open. You think I'll enjoy that?

1670
01:40:19,836 --> 01:40:21,587
Sophie.

1671
01:40:21,672 --> 01:40:25,967
Your uncle has filched a vial of morphine
from me and he won't give it back.

1672
01:40:26,051 --> 01:40:27,677
- I-Is this true?
- It is true.

1673
01:40:27,761 --> 01:40:31,222
Now, will you please tell him that I must leave
and I must have it returned?

1674
01:40:34,309 --> 01:40:36,227
Uncle, give it back.

1675
01:40:39,272 --> 01:40:41,315
Give it back, Uncle.

1676
01:40:43,151 --> 01:40:45,194
Uncle, am I more happy than you?

1677
01:40:46,738 --> 01:40:48,614
Am I despairing?

1678
01:40:50,575 --> 01:40:54,829
I bear my life, and I shall,
until it comes to its natural end.

1679
01:40:55,497 --> 01:40:57,498
So must you. Please.

1680
01:41:00,377 --> 01:41:02,003
Give it back.

1681
01:41:07,467 --> 01:41:09,093
Give it to me.

1682
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,514
Be kind.

1683
01:41:15,183 --> 01:41:18,769
You can be so kind. Take pity on me.

1684
01:41:18,854 --> 01:41:20,771
Give the bottle back.

1685
01:41:30,741 --> 01:41:33,909
Thank you.

1686
01:41:37,831 --> 01:41:41,000
All right. I need to do some work.
I need to turn my hand to something.

1687
01:41:41,084 --> 01:41:43,252
- Yes.
- Yes.

1688
01:41:43,336 --> 01:41:45,880
As soon as they've gone,
we'll sit down and we'll -

1689
01:41:45,964 --> 01:41:47,298
Yes.

1690
01:41:47,382 --> 01:41:48,507
Do the accounts.

1691
01:41:48,592 --> 01:41:51,010
Vanya! Are you here?

1692
01:41:54,181 --> 01:41:56,640
Please go to Alexandr.

1693
01:41:56,725 --> 01:41:59,185
He has something he wishes to say.

1694
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:02,730
Go on, Uncle. You have to make it up with him.
You know that.

1695
01:42:07,194 --> 01:42:09,236
Come on. I'll go in with you.

1696
01:42:22,626 --> 01:42:25,044
- I'm leaving. Good-bye.
- Leaving?

1697
01:42:27,422 --> 01:42:29,673
- The horses are here.
- Good-bye?

1698
01:42:29,758 --> 01:42:31,675
Today, you promised me
you'd move away from here.

1699
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,179
Yes, I remember.
I will, presently.

1700
01:42:35,263 --> 01:42:36,764
- You're frightened?
- Yes.

1701
01:42:36,848 --> 01:42:39,600
Then stay. Stay.

1702
01:42:40,477 --> 01:42:42,520
Stay, and tomorrow at the orchard -

1703
01:42:42,604 --> 01:42:45,731
No, we're going,
which is the reason I can look at you.

1704
01:42:46,733 --> 01:42:51,237
One thing I should like,
when you think of me, to think well of me...

1705
01:42:51,321 --> 01:42:53,197
if you can.

1706
01:42:53,281 --> 01:42:55,533
I should like you to respect me.

1707
01:42:55,617 --> 01:42:57,284
I beg you to stay.

1708
01:42:57,369 --> 01:43:01,080
Admit it. There's not one thing
in the world for you to go to.

1709
01:43:01,164 --> 01:43:03,791
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to face that fact.

1710
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:06,585
In Kharkov, in Kursk, somewhere.

1711
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:09,380
Why not here, right now?

1712
01:43:09,464 --> 01:43:12,216
Just throw it up and begin again.

1713
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:14,718
Right now. Hmm?

1714
01:43:14,803 --> 01:43:16,720
It's such a lovely autumn.

1715
01:43:16,805 --> 01:43:18,347
We have orchards.

1716
01:43:18,431 --> 01:43:21,892
We have rundown country homes
right out of Turgenev.

1717
01:43:22,894 --> 01:43:24,395
You're funny...

1718
01:43:25,355 --> 01:43:27,064
and I'm angry with you.

1719
01:43:27,149 --> 01:43:30,234
I'm sorry.

1720
01:43:30,318 --> 01:43:32,903
But I'll think of you with pleasure.

1721
01:43:32,988 --> 01:43:34,905
Why is that?

1722
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:36,699
You're an original.

1723
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:40,327
I'll tell you, I was...

1724
01:43:42,164 --> 01:43:44,415
taken with you.

1725
01:43:44,499 --> 01:43:46,834
I was tempted... by you.

1726
01:43:48,003 --> 01:43:50,421
So...

1727
01:43:50,505 --> 01:43:52,464
good.

1728
01:43:52,549 --> 01:43:55,342
Shake hands.
Don't think ill of me.

1729
01:43:56,261 --> 01:43:57,803
Good-bye then.

1730
01:43:59,973 --> 01:44:03,225
You know, I'll tell you something.

1731
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:05,477
This is strange.

1732
01:44:05,562 --> 01:44:09,607
You see, I'm sure
you're a good, warmhearted person.

1733
01:44:09,691 --> 01:44:12,109
Yet what is there in your nature?

1734
01:44:12,194 --> 01:44:13,527
Something.

1735
01:44:13,612 --> 01:44:15,279
Here you come, you and your husband...

1736
01:44:15,363 --> 01:44:18,532
and industrious people drop their work
and neglect their duties...

1737
01:44:18,617 --> 01:44:22,369
spend whole months ministering to you,
talking of you, buzzing around you...

1738
01:44:22,454 --> 01:44:24,622
worrying for your husband's gout...

1739
01:44:24,706 --> 01:44:26,332
your wishes for this and the other thing...

1740
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:29,126
and all become entangled in your idleness.

1741
01:44:29,211 --> 01:44:31,712
One whole month, I haven't done a thing.

1742
01:44:31,796 --> 01:44:35,216
People are falling ill.
Everything I cared about's decaying.

1743
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,969
Your husband and you, where you alight,
you seem to spread decay.

1744
01:44:39,054 --> 01:44:40,971
I overstated myself.

1745
01:44:41,056 --> 01:44:44,183
Yet had you stayed, I feel something -

1746
01:44:44,935 --> 01:44:48,020
something quite terrible for me...

1747
01:44:48,104 --> 01:44:50,189
for you too, would've come to pass.

1748
01:44:51,066 --> 01:44:52,900
You know it too.

1749
01:44:54,069 --> 01:44:55,819
So...

1750
01:44:55,904 --> 01:44:57,655
finita la commedia.

1751
01:44:57,739 --> 01:44:59,865
Go. And good-bye.

1752
01:45:03,453 --> 01:45:05,955
I take this as a memento.

1753
01:45:07,249 --> 01:45:11,001
Isn't that something? You come, we meet.

1754
01:45:11,086 --> 01:45:12,962
Suddenly you're gone.

1755
01:45:13,046 --> 01:45:15,256
That's the way the world is, it seems.

1756
01:45:17,008 --> 01:45:19,510
Do this though...

1757
01:45:19,594 --> 01:45:22,805
before Vanya comes back
with some bouquet for you -

1758
01:45:22,889 --> 01:45:24,598
A kiss.

1759
01:45:25,392 --> 01:45:28,269
One kiss. Yes?

1760
01:45:28,353 --> 01:45:30,354
For good-bye.

1761
01:45:30,438 --> 01:45:32,022
Yes?

1762
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:45,536
All right then. That's done.

1763
01:45:47,163 --> 01:45:49,581
That's done, and all's well.

1764
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,667
- I wish you all the best.
- As I wish you.

1765
01:45:51,751 --> 01:45:54,003
Whatever. Whatever.

1766
01:45:54,087 --> 01:45:56,547
Whatever.

1767
01:45:56,631 --> 01:46:00,134
Um, for once in my life.

1768
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:04,388
- I must go.
- Go quickly.

1769
01:46:04,472 --> 01:46:08,350
- They're coming. I think -
- Let bygones be bygones.

1770
01:46:08,435 --> 01:46:12,896
I have lived through so much
in the last four hours. I have thought so much.

1771
01:46:12,981 --> 01:46:16,400
I think I could compose a treatise for posterity
on how one ought to live.

1772
01:46:16,484 --> 01:46:20,404
I gladly accept your apology,
and I ask you to accept mine as well. Farewell.

1773
01:46:20,488 --> 01:46:22,906
You shall receive the same amount
that you received before.

1774
01:46:22,991 --> 01:46:26,452
Sent without fail, regularly.
Everything will be as it was before.

1775
01:46:26,536 --> 01:46:28,495
- Maman.
- Alexandr.

1776
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:32,791
Sit for another photograph. Have it sent to me.
How precious you are to me.

1777
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:35,753
- I will.
- Farewell, Your Excellency.

1778
01:46:35,837 --> 01:46:39,298
- Don't forget about us.
- Farewell. Farewell, all.

1779
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:42,926
And thank you for the pleasure
of your company.

1780
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:46,388
I have nothing but the utmost respect
for your way of thinking...

1781
01:46:46,473 --> 01:46:49,308
your impulses, your enthusiasm.

1782
01:46:49,392 --> 01:46:52,227
But, I pray you,
let an old man season his farewell...

1783
01:46:52,312 --> 01:46:54,438
with one small observation.

1784
01:46:54,522 --> 01:46:57,733
It's not enough to think. One must work.

1785
01:46:57,817 --> 01:46:59,401
You understand me?

1786
01:46:59,486 --> 01:47:03,947
After all, there is no greater joy
than to do real work in the real world.

1787
01:47:04,032 --> 01:47:06,492
All the best to you, ladies and gentlemen.
All the best.

1788
01:47:06,576 --> 01:47:08,619
I wish you all the best. Good-bye.

1789
01:47:08,703 --> 01:47:11,622
Waffles, while they're at it,
have them bring my horses too.

1790
01:47:11,706 --> 01:47:13,832
My friend, I will.

1791
01:47:16,252 --> 01:47:18,045
Forgive me.

1792
01:47:18,129 --> 01:47:19,838
We'll never meet again.

1793
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:24,385
Farewell, my dear.

1794
01:47:31,643 --> 01:47:33,060
Farewell.

1795
01:47:40,485 --> 01:47:42,027
Not going to see them off?

1796
01:47:43,780 --> 01:47:46,198
Let them go where they're going to.

1797
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:50,577
No, it's, uh...

1798
01:47:51,955 --> 01:47:52,955
too difficult.

1799
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:55,666
I'm gonna just...

1800
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:59,420
turn - turn my hand to something.

1801
01:48:09,305 --> 01:48:10,806
They're gone.

1802
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:14,977
Well, the professor must be thrilled.

1803
01:48:15,061 --> 01:48:18,188
God himself couldn't lure that man back here.

1804
01:48:18,273 --> 01:48:19,773
They're gone.

1805
01:48:22,819 --> 01:48:24,611
They've gone.

1806
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:27,948
God grant them the best.

1807
01:48:31,578 --> 01:48:33,912
Well, Uncle, what shall we do?

1808
01:48:36,624 --> 01:48:38,542
- Work.
- Yes.

1809
01:48:38,626 --> 01:48:40,961
Absolutely!

1810
01:48:45,258 --> 01:48:48,218
What? A long while
since we've been here together.

1811
01:48:52,432 --> 01:48:54,516
I think the ink is gone.

1812
01:48:57,645 --> 01:48:59,980
Now they're gone, I'm sad.

1813
01:49:05,445 --> 01:49:07,446
- They're gone.
- All right.

1814
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:10,824
First we'll start with the accounts.
They're in a wretched state.

1815
01:49:10,909 --> 01:49:15,329
A fellow wrote today and said
this is the third time he's asked for his balance.

1816
01:49:15,413 --> 01:49:20,083
So you take that one
and I'll take the next one, and so on.

1817
01:49:20,168 --> 01:49:23,212
Oh, this is for the account of -

1818
01:49:35,016 --> 01:49:37,309
In the stillness, pens are scratching.

1819
01:49:39,229 --> 01:49:41,730
The crickets chirp.

1820
01:49:41,814 --> 01:49:43,148
Warm.

1821
01:49:45,026 --> 01:49:46,568
Close.

1822
01:49:48,738 --> 01:49:51,532
You know, I don't feel like leaving somehow.

1823
01:49:56,329 --> 01:49:58,664
There are my horses.

1824
01:49:58,748 --> 01:50:01,667
I guess all that's left is my good-bye.
I'm off then.

1825
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:03,794
- Stay a while.
- I can't.

1826
01:50:03,878 --> 01:50:06,713
- Doctor, your horses are here.
- Yes, I heard them. Thank you, Waffles.

1827
01:50:06,798 --> 01:50:10,676
Uh, would you put this in my carriage?
Exercise extreme care with this, please.

1828
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:12,469
And the portfolio.

1829
01:50:14,722 --> 01:50:16,723
- Well -
- When will we see you again?

1830
01:50:16,808 --> 01:50:19,059
Ah, not before summer, I'd think.

1831
01:50:19,143 --> 01:50:21,520
Hardly this winter.
Of course, if you should need me.

1832
01:50:21,604 --> 01:50:24,648
- Thank you for your hospitality.
- Yes.

1833
01:50:24,732 --> 01:50:27,109
- For your kindness.
- Yes.

1834
01:50:27,193 --> 01:50:28,986
Thank you for everything.

1835
01:50:31,197 --> 01:50:34,575
Old one, farewell.

1836
01:50:35,618 --> 01:50:37,411
Mmm.

1837
01:50:37,495 --> 01:50:40,497
- You haven't had your tea.
- I don't want any.

1838
01:50:40,582 --> 01:50:44,167
- A little vodka?
- Perhaps a small one.

1839
01:50:54,971 --> 01:50:57,514
I've got my trace horse limping.
Don't know why.

1840
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,267
I noticed it yesterday when he was coming up.

1841
01:51:00,935 --> 01:51:04,730
- He needs reshoeing.
- I'll stop by the farrier at Rozhdestvennoye.

1842
01:51:04,814 --> 01:51:07,107
- I would.
- No help for him.

1843
01:51:18,328 --> 01:51:21,997
You know, I would think down in Africa
the heat must be intense.

1844
01:51:22,957 --> 01:51:24,833
I think so.

1845
01:51:26,377 --> 01:51:28,712
- Here you are.
- Oh.

1846
01:51:28,796 --> 01:51:31,548
- To your health, little father.
- Thank you, Nanny.

1847
01:51:35,762 --> 01:51:38,555
- Eat some bread with it.
- Ah!

1848
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,641
No, I don't want any, thank you.

1849
01:51:43,603 --> 01:51:46,313
Good-bye. All the best to you.

1850
01:51:55,156 --> 01:51:56,740
Good-bye.

1851
01:52:24,143 --> 01:52:26,228
February the 15th...

1852
01:52:26,312 --> 01:52:30,190
16 pounds vegetable oil.

1853
01:52:30,274 --> 01:52:32,401
February 20th...

1854
01:52:32,485 --> 01:52:35,153
five pounds buckwheat.

1855
01:52:40,201 --> 01:52:49,960
He's gone.

1856
01:52:52,004 --> 01:52:57,467
For a subtotal of 15.20.

1857
01:52:58,219 --> 01:53:01,722
- Twenty-five.

1858
01:53:02,849 --> 01:53:04,516
Mercy.

1859
01:53:19,949 --> 01:53:22,909
How hard this is for me.

1860
01:53:23,911 --> 01:53:26,496
You don't know how hard it is for me.
You can't know.

1861
01:53:30,585 --> 01:53:32,085
What can we do, Uncle?

1862
01:53:35,256 --> 01:53:37,424
All we can do is live.

1863
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:42,429
We'll live through...

1864
01:53:42,513 --> 01:53:44,890
a long row of days...

1865
01:53:46,684 --> 01:53:49,936
and through the endless evenings.

1866
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,357
And we'll bear up...

1867
01:53:55,902 --> 01:53:58,028
under the trials fate has sent to us.

1868
01:53:58,112 --> 01:54:02,032
We... will constantly toil for others...

1869
01:54:03,701 --> 01:54:06,703
now and for the rest of our days.

1870
01:54:08,748 --> 01:54:11,041
And when we come to die...

1871
01:54:13,085 --> 01:54:15,086
we'll die submissively.

1872
01:54:20,426 --> 01:54:23,845
Beyond the grave,
we will testify that we've suffered...

1873
01:54:26,599 --> 01:54:28,308
that we've wept...

1874
01:54:30,728 --> 01:54:32,813
that we've known bitterness.

1875
01:54:35,650 --> 01:54:38,151
And God will take pity on us...

1876
01:54:40,488 --> 01:54:42,239
you and I, Uncle.

1877
01:54:43,574 --> 01:54:47,118
God will take pity on us, and we will live...

1878
01:54:47,203 --> 01:54:49,913
a life of radiant joy...

1879
01:54:51,207 --> 01:54:53,041
and beauty.

1880
01:54:55,211 --> 01:54:59,422
And we'll look back on this life
of our unhappiness with tenderness.

1881
01:55:01,509 --> 01:55:03,218
And we'll smile.

1882
01:55:09,559 --> 01:55:12,394
And in that new life, we shall rest, Uncle.

1883
01:55:14,272 --> 01:55:16,189
I have faith.

1884
01:55:17,567 --> 01:55:20,902
We shall rest to the songs of the angels -

1885
01:55:24,198 --> 01:55:28,618
In a firmament arrayed in jewels,
and we'll look down...

1886
01:55:28,703 --> 01:55:31,288
and we'll see evil...

1887
01:55:31,372 --> 01:55:33,874
all the evil in the world...

1888
01:55:34,625 --> 01:55:38,420
and all our sufferings
bathed in a perfect mercy...

1889
01:55:40,882 --> 01:55:43,758
and our lives grown sweet as a caress.

1890
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:52,350
I know you've had no joy in your life.

1891
01:55:53,352 --> 01:55:55,145
But just wait.

1892
01:55:57,565 --> 01:55:59,691
Only wait, Uncle.

1893
01:56:01,736 --> 01:56:11,244
We shall rest.
