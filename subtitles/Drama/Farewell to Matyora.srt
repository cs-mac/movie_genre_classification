1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,419
VERSAILLES, 14 JULY 1789

2
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,095
Sidonie...

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,135
What time is it?
It's me. Louison.

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,249
6:15 a.m.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,659
What do you want?

6
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,998
Can I see the clock?

7
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,294
You've seen it a hundred times.
- Please!

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,275
No!

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,397
Can I come in?

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,297
You know with whom I slept?

11
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,694
I don't care.

12
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,712
You're gonna end up as an old maid!

13
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
Get away!

14
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,133
FAREWELL, MY QUEEN

15
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,375
Hurry up.
The Queen is waiting at Trianon.

16
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,895
She slept there?
- She sleeps where she wants.

17
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,402
Jasmine and Violet?

18
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Violet.

19
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,805
How is Madame de Bargue?

20
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,135
She vomited all night.

21
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,565
The more he cheats on her
the more she eats.

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,462
Thank you, Alice.
I feel much better now.

23
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,886
Sidonie!

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,573
Forgot something?

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,454
Hurry!

26
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,975
Ten minutes late!

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,655
For what have I given you
the clock of Mr. Janvier?

28
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,415
I am sorry, Madame Campan.

29
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,813
And all dirty!

30
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,826
Her Majesty slept well?
- Not at all.

31
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,768
She had a nightmare.
Madame de Soubise found her crying.

32
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,855
What will you read?
- Marivaux.

33
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,094
Better not!

34
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,935
I rather recommend...
Bossuet's funeral eulogies.

35
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,295
Those of Maria-Theresa of Austria?
- Excellent idea!

36
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,032
Anything Austrian is comforting
for Her Majesty.

37
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,275
Mademoiselle Laborde!

38
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,133
And so soon!
How can I thank you?

39
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,615
I'd travel even further for Your Majesty,
if this is required.

40
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,122
I am well aware of your loyalty.
Come closer.

41
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,979
A cup of coffee!

42
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,055
Taste this marvelous
flavour from the Antilles.

43
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,638
A special treat for the papillae!

44
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,298
See? I make rhymes.

45
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,295
You burned your tongue?

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,898
Barely, Majesty.

47
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,895
This coffee is exquisite.

48
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,171
Take your time, Mademoiselle.

49
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,610
What will you read to me?

50
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,695
I thought Bossuet's funeral eulogies
of Maria-Theresa of Austria.

51
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,173
Oh no! How bleak!

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
That poor woman was bored
all her life.

53
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,615
You know what she said
when she died?

54
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,295
"Ever since I was the Queen,
I had only one happy day in my life!"

55
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,955
And nobody knows which day it was.

56
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,292
No, please...

57
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,660
Give me something that is...

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,819
a bit frivolous.

59
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,415
I also thought about...
"The Life of Marianne".

60
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,973
The second chapter.

61
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,795
When Valville bumps into her
after the service.

62
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,226
Marivaux is fair enough.

63
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,295
But I prefer the theater
over novels.

64
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,058
Bring me...

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,215
"Félicie" from the library.

66
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,183
Right away, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
And?

68
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,532
Everything's fine.

69
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,783
I'm going to the library.

70
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,174
"This is really a nice day."

71
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,015
"And we have been taking a walk
for quite a while now."

72
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,735
"And the pleasure of
spending time with you"

73
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,735
"is always great. But this time
it touches me very much."

74
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,975
"I think you love me, Félicie."

75
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,789
"You think so, Madame?"

76
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,020
"What?"

77
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,383
"Now you recognize that this is true?"

78
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,735
"You, the reason for everything of value
in my heart and soul?"

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,335
"You've always been the object of my..."

80
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,935
Why do you scratch yourself so often?

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,254
Mosquito bites.

82
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,055
Let me have a look...

83
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,169
I am sorry.

84
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
Augustine!

85
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,858
Call Madame Campan!

86
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,295
You know where they come from?

87
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,417
From the pond!

88
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,773
Considering that we wash
with that water...

89
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,935
They say there are even rats there.

90
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
Disgusting!

91
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,735
Your Majesty called for me?

92
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,135
Yes, Madame Campan.

93
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,690
Please, bring some rosewood oil
for Mademoiselle Laborde.

94
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,774
Everything is so disgusting!

95
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,335
If it goes on like this,
we'll soon be living in the sewer.

96
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,765
I am truly sorry, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,577
Do you want us to continue
with Félicie?

98
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,131
No, it's enough.

99
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,375
Read me from fashion magazines.

100
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,882
Didn't you bring them last time?

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,173
I'm listening.

102
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,015
"Dresses are embroidered
with gold and silver."

103
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,598
"Especially preferred these days"

104
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,255
"are accessories of tulle or filet work"

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
"with festoons of flowers"

106
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,574
"and with hooks shaped
like love straps."

107
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,329
Go on.

108
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,878
"Also, there are Chinese tassels"

109
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,826
"or cornucopias spreading flowers..."

110
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,290
Go on. The embroidery!

111
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,395
"Colorful embroidered corsages
of finest linen"

112
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,414
"quickly gave way
to dresses with embroidery..."

113
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,328
I have an idea
for my dresses!

114
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,135
Tell Madame d'Ossun to bring my
booklet with the design samples.

115
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,103
An embroidery...
that mimics a dahlia.

116
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,775
You see?

117
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,562
Yes, Madame Campan?

118
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,895
Oh yes, I forgot!

119
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,055
Give it to me.

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,558
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,413
Show me your arm.

122
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,573
That's scandalous!

123
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,371
Such a pretty little arm,
totally swollen.

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,574
The rosewood oil

125
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,362
is good for calming
the itching.

126
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,558
The itching is gone.

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,894
Madame d'Ossun!

128
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,977
Come!

129
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,038
Give me the booklet.

130
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,734
I have a fabric here which
is a very good match

131
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,289
for the embroidery.

132
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,171
There it is!

133
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,851
We have to ask Madame Bertin.

134
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,189
She's a fairy!

135
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,375
You scratch yourself
in front of the Queen?

136
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,112
We'll talk about this!

137
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,549
Are you really Italian?

138
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,977
Don't you notice my accent?

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,842
I'm from an old Venetian family.

140
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,055
What's the song about?

141
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,977
You better not know.

142
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,334
Why not?
- It's a love song.

143
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,045
Not very original!

144
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,700
The Duchess!

145
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,615
Do you know the Duchess De Polignac?

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,975
Everyone at the palace knows
Gabrielle De Polignac.

147
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,215
I am not from the palace,
but I have good ears.

148
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,645
The Queen is besotted with her.

149
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,888
They say Gabrielle de Polignac

150
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,812
ignores her husband.

151
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,569
And that she's slutty.

152
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,335
None of my business.

153
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,893
I know for sure.

154
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,215
She loves the tours with my Gondola.

155
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,722
Can you row faster?

156
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,089
You'll see.

157
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,575
She'll get rid of her chambermaid
so she can be alone with me.

158
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,695
Last time, she wanted to see
"il mio cazzo".

159
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,975
You know what I mean?

160
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,635
I don't want to know.

161
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,482
What's your name?
- Shut up now.

162
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,412
Can you turn around?

163
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,895
Do you wish me to go
with you, Duchess?

164
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,455
Not necessary, Madame Tournon.

165
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,731
With Paolo I'm in safe hands.

166
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,731
How is the Queen?

167
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,573
She feels great.

168
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,215
They say Paris is getting short
of bread more and more.

169
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,455
That's why the wolves
stopped coming out of the woods.

170
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,855
What's that absurdity you talk about?

171
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,655
That's what I hear everywhere.

172
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,546
You're talking nonsense.

173
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,895
At my age
I do not fear to face the truth.

174
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,171
The truth is, in Versailles we're safe,
Madame Tournon!

175
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,735
You told the Queen you do embroidery?

176
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,974
Of course not.

177
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,895
I would end up being her embroiderer.

178
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,325
Marie-Antoinette prefers
dresses over books.

179
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,817
I don't want go back there.

180
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,882
I can't stand the thought of it.

181
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,645
I hate this job...

182
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,780
and my mistress who doesn't stop
with this tapestry.

183
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,537
You're much faster than me!

184
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,895
Do not stitch the trees.

185
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,017
We'll tell her these are
flying poppies.

186
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,339
My back hurts.

187
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,379
And I'm hungry!

188
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
I'm sick of this
never-ending tapestry!

189
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,295
For me it's like traveling
through a wonderful landscape.

190
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,735
I understand why the Queen spends
hours looking at her fabrics.

191
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,975
It makes her forget
that she's the Queen.

192
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,866
I never forget who I am.

193
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,811
You're both crazy!

194
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,257
You know a guy named Paolo?

195
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,175
The gondolier of Little Venice?
That's René.

196
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,528
He's been there for two weeks.

197
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,375
But he speaks Italian?

198
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,935
He's a broke comedian,
classic example of a liar.

199
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,211
Don't trust him!

200
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,616
For sure he's handsome.

201
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,171
He's taking advantage of that.
Believe me.

202
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
"Cazzo"...

203
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,472
Do you know that word?

204
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,497
You really wanna know that?

205
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,569
Penis.

206
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,602
As I said,
don't trust this guy!

207
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,733
Stop whispering!

208
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,325
I guess that's not for your
ears of modesty.

209
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,975
Louison has a new lover.
- I know.

210
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,295
Until the next one.

211
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,575
His name is Gustav.

212
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,095
And he's an infantryman
in the Swiss regiment.

213
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,695
They're ready for war yet.

214
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,175
His captain says
he speaks only German.

215
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,415
But no need to talk.
Let's get straight to the point!

216
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,575
The priests!
Time to confess, Louison!

217
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,095
Tell me, sweethearts,
do you know Ratafia liquor?

218
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,175
Drinks for everyone!

219
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,575
We've just had dinner at
Cardinal Montmorency's.

220
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,975
More than 80 desserts.

221
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,092
Not counting candied fruit,
compote,

222
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,975
ice cream and brittles.

223
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,335
I love crystallized lemon.

224
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,457
I know your taste, Louison.

225
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,469
Crystallized stalks of angelica.
Well worth a little kiss, no?

226
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,506
Just a kiss on the neck.

227
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,455
Gaspard,
you have a violin?

228
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,962
Play a contradance!

229
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,096
To King Louis!

230
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,175
I know many names
of the new government.

231
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,778
Names! I love names!

232
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,815
Wanna hear some?
The Princess of Lamballe,

233
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,935
superintendent of the
Queen's court.

234
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,175
The Countess of Ossun,
dressmaid of the Queen.

235
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,451
I saw her today.

236
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,415
The Earl of Hassonville,
superintendent for hunting.

237
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,455
The Princess of Chimay
courtmaid of the Queen.

238
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,173
The ladies accompanying
Madame...

239
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,129
The ladies of ladies...

240
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,490
VERSAILLES, JULY 15, 1789

241
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Sidonie!

242
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,414
Open the door!
It's Louison.

243
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,937
Somebody woke up the King
in the middle of the night!

244
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,538
Apparently cramps.

245
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,796
Is the King ill?

246
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,855
My cousin, steward of the King,
keeps guard at his bed.

247
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,255
And what does he say?

248
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,531
He ate cod that
wasn't fresh.

249
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,198
Nonsense,
I know his chamberlain.

250
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,695
The King was looking forward
to hunt today.

251
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,432
Did you hear the news?

252
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,015
The King had been woken up
at two o'clock in the morning.

253
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,895
I brought water for you.

254
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,655
Madame de Bargue told you that?
- No. Honorine.

255
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,935
Does the Queen know?
- Ask her!

256
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,826
I have to go back
or I'll be scolded.

257
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,655
You call this bread?

258
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,238
For some, it's enough for a week.

259
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,015
And? What have you found out?

260
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,214
I'd know if I spoke English.

261
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,685
An Englishman woke up the King?

262
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,135
When they discuss important things,
the De la Tour du Pin talk in English.

263
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,135
What I understood was "Bastille".
They said it four times.

264
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,735
There must be something
serious at the Bastille.

265
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,780
A jailbreak or a fire?
I'll ask Gustav.

266
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,792
Monsieur Moreau must have information.
He sure speaks French.

267
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,855
Will you tell us?

268
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
If he gives me permission.

269
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,075
Mademoiselle Laborde!

270
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,826
Madame Bertin needs you.

271
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,423
I will prepare the Queen's
relocation.

272
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,935
It's a bit complicated,
but... well...

273
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,749
I'll explain it to you.

274
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,655
Marie-Louise, my embroiderer,
is ill.

275
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,315
And the Queen asked me
to make a dahlia design.

276
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,255
You know how the Queen is.

277
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,495
When she wants something
she's so impatient

278
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,095
that it makes you dizzy.

279
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,695
Does Madame Campan think
I'm bored when I don't read?

280
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,595
She assured me
you're a good embroiderer.

281
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,195
She doesn't know the difference
between reading and embroidery.

282
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,475
But I do.

283
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,776
I envy you for your passion for books.

284
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,825
When the time is right, I'll tell the Queen
that it was you who created the design.

285
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,325
No, please don't.

286
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,700
She doesn't know I embroider.

287
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,875
So you accept?

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,766
There's one condition...

289
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,975
You want to be paid the same
as Marie-Louise?

290
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,635
It's not about money.

291
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,586
It's about that night...

292
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,552
Madame Campan sure knows something.

293
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,615
She made me swear.

294
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,198
I won't tell anyone.

295
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,645
Excuse me, but ...

296
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,485
I didn't catch it.

297
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,945
The people stormed the Bastille.

298
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,250
The Bastille?

299
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,455
The Queen has been informed
this morning.

300
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,015
She asked De Breuil to march
to Paris with a foreign regiment.

301
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,415
The Count of Artois supports her.

302
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,095
The King's brother?
- Yes.

303
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,602
The King is very angry with him.

304
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,125
Right now he's in consultation.

305
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,655
The situation is very serious.

306
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,935
Don't talk to anyone about this!

307
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,000
Jesus!

308
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,015
It would break the Queen's trust in me.
Come with me.

309
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,015
I will give you her design booklet.
Madame D'Ossun will not know.

310
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,375
How long will it take for you
to make the embroidery?

311
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,189
Only a small dahlia,
to give Her Majesty an idea.

312
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,078
Am I disturbing you?

313
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,768
You never disturb me,
Mademoiselle Laborde.

314
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,973
You want the news?

315
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,415
I already know the essentials.

316
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,090
Monsieur De Barentin, who just left,
he gave me the details.

317
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,058
Don't keep standing.

318
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,738
Take a seat.

319
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,779
Sit down.

320
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,015
Well then...

321
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,338
Yesterday at dawn

322
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,297
a convoy with ammunition
heading for the Bastille

323
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,309
was attacked by rioters

324
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,755
who then plundered
the arsenal of the invalids.

325
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,658
The people got armed

326
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,706
and then marched
in great numbers to the Bastille.

327
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,212
The guards' resistance
was brave,

328
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,655
but in vain.

329
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,815
The commander of the fortress,
Monsieur De Launey, was beheaded.

330
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,373
Many Swiss guards

331
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,729
got massacred.

332
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,575
And you know what the rebels
found in the prison?

333
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,005
Four counterfeiters,
two madmen

334
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,497
and a lecher who was jailed
at request of his own family.

335
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,415
I don't know what to say.

336
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,015
There is nothing left to say anyway.

337
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,522
The damage is done.

338
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,056
The riots will spread all over
the kingdom.

339
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,575
It's a bad business to be an officer
of the King at the moment.

340
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,894
So it's true.

341
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,095
Someone woke up the King at night.

342
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,775
The Duke of La Rochefoucauld
had the honor to do it...

343
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,458
and the bad luck.

344
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,177
What will happen to us,
Monsieur Moreau?

345
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,849
Promise me...

346
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,095
Don't tell anyone that I have
the Queen's design booklet.

347
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,602
You can rely on me.

348
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,529
Look.

349
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,251
I will embroider this dahlia.

350
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,722
This way, Madame...

351
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,495
What are they talking about?
- They're talking in English.

352
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,215
I heard them say "Polignac".

353
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,295
Gabrielle?

354
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,155
You call her Gabrielle?

355
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,969
Why?
Do we have to call her Duchess?

356
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,613
Duchess, my ass...

357
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,934
She takes advantage of that.

358
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,371
What do you say?

359
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,375
Don't you start with that, too!

360
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,575
From a provincial in debt
to favorite of the Queen.

361
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,235
How do you call this?

362
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,138
I call this a whore.

363
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,256
You parrot your mistress.

364
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,413
I say what everyone says.

365
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,672
She brings joy to the Queen's life.

366
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,805
Now, shut up or I'll leave.

367
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,535
Come on! You already know
what she does with Paolo...

368
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,093
Shut up already!

369
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,059
The King!

370
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,762
I must be dreaming!

371
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,729
Look!

372
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,211
That's the King!

373
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,946
He's leaving the palace.

374
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,210
On foot.

375
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,035
Is he escaping?
- No.

376
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,937
His brothers are following.

377
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,008
They aren't looking too happy.

378
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,935
Where are they going?

379
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,655
The King isn't wearing
his hat with feathers.

380
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,419
Look, his brother almost slipped!

381
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,005
With that fat ass of his
he'd bounce softly.

382
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,968
I'll go and see them up-close.

383
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,455
You're coming with me?
- What if my mistress rings for me?

384
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,962
Tell her they took the Bastille!

385
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,974
This is torture.

386
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,648
No, my brother.

387
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,538
It's a necessity.

388
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,055
They do everything the wrong way round.

389
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,715
If my master sees me!

390
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,555
Monsieur De la Tour du Pin is a deputy.

391
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,495
And...?

392
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,255
He sure will negotiate with deputy De Bailly.

393
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,295
Negotiate what?

394
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,494
I'm tired of your questions!

395
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,608
Let me through!

396
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
Louison!

397
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,895
Sidonie, this is my Gustav.

398
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,415
Sidonie Laborde,
the Queen's reader.

399
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,998
Only second reader.
- Too complicated for him.

400
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,955
Magnificent mustache!

401
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,808
He can let us in?

402
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,015
How kindly you are all of a sudden!

403
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,906
What do I get in return?

404
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,975
I'll lend Monsieur Janvier's clock
to you for a whole night.

405
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,248
Really?

406
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Go through!

407
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:19,906
Go!

408
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
This is my heartfelt wish,

409
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,652
my most fervent wish.

410
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,895
And I hope to be rewarded for
the rectitude of my intentions

411
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,017
and the love for my people.

412
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,583
Don't you come to dinner?

413
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,950
So early?

414
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,419
What time is it?

415
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,125
Where's the clock?

416
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,196
I've lent it to Louison.

417
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,249
How beautiful.

418
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,729
Who is it for?

419
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,339
For a dear friend.

420
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,840
Do I know her?

421
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,200
No.

422
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,131
Madame is constipated,
so she doesn't eat.

423
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,775
How about some "Queen's pastry"?

424
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,219
I'm not hungry.

425
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,139
What will you do?

426
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,089
Wait.

427
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,253
Wait for what?

428
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,491
For the Queen to call for me.

429
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,018
With empty stomach?

430
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,259
I'm afraid, Alice.

431
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,082
I'm afraid for her.

432
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,294
Queen's pastry!

433
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,138
You're spoiling me!

434
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,955
I was already settled
with some lentils.

435
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,436
Careful.

436
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,575
Sorry, I have poor vision.

437
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,615
Me too...

438
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,093
Less and less.

439
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,448
I have the feeling even dusk
starts earlier than before.

440
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,009
God!

441
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,175
It's been ages since
I had eaten this!

442
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,015
You work too much,
Monsieur Moreau.

443
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,135
That's bad for your vision and health.

444
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,614
The ongoing events get to me.

445
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,895
Things happen too fast now.

446
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,695
They cheered for the King.

447
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,055
They cheered because he
spoke standing and without his hat.

448
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,055
They didn't cheer for the King,

449
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,331
but for just another citizen.

450
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,729
Delicious!

451
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,669
You know what hurts me most?

452
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,802
The hostility towards the Queen.

453
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,285
I know your fervor for
for Marie Antoinette.

454
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,248
Not at all.

455
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,303
I'm only her maidservant.

456
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,649
What do I say?

457
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,103
Maidservant for the books
of Her Majesty's library.

458
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,257
There is no fervor to this.

459
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,979
So young...

460
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,213
and already blind.

461
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,929
Your love for the Queen

462
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,295
makes you judge her capricious
behavior with too much indulgence.

463
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,138
Gabrielle de Polignac is an illusion

464
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,811
which will cost her dearly...

465
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,874
And she's not yet finished
paying for it.

466
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,069
I don't want you to
hook up with the wrong crowd.

467
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,009
Moreau!

468
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,409
Tell me...

469
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,935
Where are the servants?

470
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,939
I've been ringing for one hour
and nobody answered.

471
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,655
Nobody comes,
that's unacceptable!

472
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,777
Monsieur Marquis, I assume they
are just as lost as their masters.

473
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,415
The Marquis has been living
for ten years in a dump.

474
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,255
While his a castle is said
to be magnificent.

475
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,655
All this, just to see the King
in the big hall twice a week.

476
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,815
And that's only when he's very lucky.

477
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,816
Moreau! Right on time!

478
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,295
What's going on with that armed mob
that wants to attack Versailles?

479
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,295
How long will it take them
to get to Paris?

480
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,355
Twelve hours? Fifteen?

481
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,215
Is the King prepared for this?

482
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,295
In the meantime prepare yourself,
Monsieur De Jolivet.

483
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,571
The people is a material highly flammable.

484
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,694
I have to organize our defense.

485
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,611
I think I'll be staying here.

486
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,174
Here? Such absurd idea!

487
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,655
I won't be able to find any sleep in my room.

488
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,656
Then I say goodbye now.

489
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,977
And thanks for the improvised dinner.

490
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,488
It was delicious.

491
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,738
But one thing was missing...

492
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,832
A good bottle of wine.

493
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,678
I completely forgot!

494
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,769
Should I get one?

495
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,055
Don't bother, Mademoiselle.

496
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,489
I'll go myself,

497
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,930
I have to stretch my legs.

498
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,975
Well...

499
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,454
everyone says I'm wise,

500
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,549
but I'm no different than any other.

501
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,895
It's just a pamphlet,

502
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,415
but it illustrates what happens
right in front of the guards.

503
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,229
Mademoiselle Laborde...

504
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,537
When you see the Queen,

505
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,469
tell her about this disgracefulness.

506
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,786
Could you read it to us?

507
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,718
This is the list ...

508
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,657
with the 286 heads...

509
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
that need to be cut off...

510
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,780
to carry on with the necessary reforms.

511
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,472
The first two names...

512
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,492
are the Queen...

513
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,906
and the Count of Artois.

514
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Then...

515
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,094
Then?

516
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
The Duchess De Polignac...

517
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,722
and the Princess...

518
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,699
of Lamballe.

519
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,054
I am...

520
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,937
the 21st head...

521
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,635
they want to cut off.

522
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,531
Monsieur Moreau!

523
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,014
Sidonie!

524
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,815
It's not the end of the world yet, but ...

525
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,532
You drank too much.

526
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,255
The Queen is in danger.

527
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,455
When the worm is in the apple...

528
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,455
Go away!

529
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,615
They've been looking everywhere
for you, my little bunny.

530
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,775
Who is looking for me?

531
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,889
The Wolf.

532
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,792
Who is looking for me?

533
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,695
Make way for the young!

534
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,202
I'll return to the kitchen area.

535
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,295
The cooking wine's flavor is sour, but...

536
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,853
it'll do.

537
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,368
What do you want?

538
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,352
You know that already.

539
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,392
And you want the same.

540
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,750
Come with me!

541
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,362
When he saw his name on the list,
he fainted.

542
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,049
Hurry up!

543
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,737
It'd be better in my cabin.

544
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,698
Leave it to me!

545
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,349
Do you prefer Gabrielle de Polignac?

546
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,257
What if I tell you since yesterday
I've been only thinking of you?

547
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,771
Sidonie Laborde!

548
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,790
Sidonie Laborde!

549
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,954
Stay in here!

550
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,931
If you show yourself,
we'll never see each other again.

551
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Alice!

552
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,015
The Queen's runner has been
looking for you everywhere!

553
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,829
Oh my god!
I left the Queen waiting!

554
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,369
You haven't been in your room.

555
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,335
A serious fault during such hectic night.

556
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,534
We'll talk later about this.

557
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,855
The Queen is reading
and organizing some papers.

558
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,735
She doesn't need a reader this time.

559
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,056
Write down some book titles,

560
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,579
a dozen at most,

561
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,935
that are indispensable
in case she goes to the countryside.

562
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,903
The Queen wants to leave?

563
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,694
Don't ask questions, please!

564
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,334
I'd feel more comfortable in the library.

565
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,910
Nobody cares if you're comfortable or not.

566
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,866
The library and the annex
will be full of luggage.

567
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,097
Go to the bathroom.

568
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,762
I'll be sorting the Queen's clothes
together with Madame De Rochereuil.

569
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,455
The Queen doesn't need this shirt.

570
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,175
I'll sell it for a good price.

571
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,414
Not so loud!

572
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,690
No more contempt!

573
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,975
We are human beings just like her.

574
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,535
Even now she thinks she's superior...

575
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,177
Don't you agree, Henriette?

576
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,535
She's still reading letters of her lovers?

577
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,969
We'll be here till the morning.

578
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,535
She burns many of them.

579
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,655
Also the list of her expenses,

580
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,175
especially those that show
her generosity for the Polignacs.

581
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,290
This white silk corsage...

582
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,650
Not even her style, is it?

583
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,171
Let's make fifty-fifty.
- No.

584
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,932
I don't do that.

585
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,975
It's a mistake not to use
this opportunity.

586
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,635
Believe me,
you'll regret it soon.

587
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,975
Your brother will tell you.

588
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,975
He tells everyone how much
he's fed up with kings.

589
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,169
Shut up!

590
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,095
Shut up!

591
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,254
You think so?

592
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,739
That's my job.

593
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,895
I know her taste
better than you do.

594
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,532
We'll see.

595
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,015
Why do you look at me like that?

596
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,214
Close the door!

597
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,691
The Queen is calling for you.

598
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,495
Mademoiselle Laborde
at your service, Majesty.

599
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,893
Leave us alone!

600
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,294
I didn't know you were here.

601
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,411
They hide everything from me.

602
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,292
It's unbearable.

603
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,369
Come closer!

604
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,412
I need your help.

605
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,408
Helping you is my greatest
desire, Majesty.

606
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,410
I know I can count on you.

607
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,208
Your discretion is honourable.

608
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,795
What I'll ask you for
won't take too much time.

609
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,979
In the library you'll find
geography books

610
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,932
with detailed maps.

611
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,059
Find out the best travel route

612
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,414
between Versailles and Metz.

613
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,735
Monsieur Le Cornu of Balivière!

614
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,086
Madame!

615
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,263
This is what circulates in the palace.

616
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,135
This is why I'm organising my departure
for Metz, my dear friend.

617
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,695
Count Esterhâzy will join us
en route with his regiment.

618
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,509
In Metz we'll gather troops
and then storm Paris.

619
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,415
It's a crime that this city
wants to give orders to the King!

620
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,768
...and to France!

621
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,838
Paris is not France.

622
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,615
What does the King say?

623
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,298
He thinks the same.

624
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,131
Metz has a powerful fortress.

625
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,337
It's a wise choice.

626
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:36,798
Don't pay too much attention
to this pamphlet.

627
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,328
It smells as bad as manure,

628
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,463
like anything from Paris.

629
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,175
The King wants to get advice
from his brothers.

630
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,695
Tonight,
but no later than tomorrow.

631
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,894
We have to let the King act.

632
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,619
At least for now.

633
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,855
The Duke of Bourbon has fled,
disguised as a stableman.

634
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,438
And I'll leave dressed as
the Queen of France!

635
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,562
Leave me alone now.

636
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,842
Good night, Madame.

637
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,730
Good Lord, I'm so tired!

638
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,955
I can't get up the energy
anymore.

639
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,808
The mere thought of the trip
hurts my back.

640
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,255
Are you still there?

641
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,813
Yes, Your Majesty.

642
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,992
Close the door
and then come to me.

643
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,169
Go where I can see you.

644
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,693
Take this seat.

645
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,055
You know what I find so charming
about you, Sidonie?

646
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,135
It's not so much the beauty
of your facial lines.

647
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,055
It's rather the youth
that you radiate all the time.

648
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,946
But Your Majesty, you're so young ...

649
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,255
I was.

650
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,685
I have a question.

651
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,735
I will answer all of
Her Majesty's questions

652
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,498
as far as I'm able to.

653
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,415
Did you ever feel attracted
to a woman...

654
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,913
to the point of...

655
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,172
suffering terribly
when she's not there?

656
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,755
I can spend hours imagining her...

657
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,568
with my eyes closed:
the shape of her face,

658
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,530
the softness of her skin,

659
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,122
the cheerful glow of her eyes...

660
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,655
I guess I know who
you're talking about.

661
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,655
I envy her for being the object
of such intimate friendship.

662
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,085
Until the point...

663
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,815
that in miserable times
I only think of her absence.

664
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,255
It depends on you...

665
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,685
Unfortunately not.

666
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,855
Gabrielle de Polignac
isn't one of those persons

667
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,494
who can easily be seduced.

668
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,368
I was captivated
when I saw her at Trianon.

669
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,528
She felt at home.

670
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,535
She went in and out
as if she had always lived there.

671
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,349
She was never lead by
the intention to please me.

672
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,254
I like that kind of freedom.

673
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,738
You may wonder why she's not here

674
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,735
although I'm craving so much
for her presence.

675
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,549
I, the Queen of France.

676
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,263
The answer to that question scares me.

677
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,095
I have to recognize that...

678
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,019
I am her prisoner.

679
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,415
It's been two hours since I asked
Madame Campan to call for her.

680
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,736
Gabrielle let her know
that she's angry.

681
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,614
But what is she angry about?

682
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,562
What have I done to put her off?

683
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,835
May I try what
Madame Campan wasn't able to do?

684
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,814
I will find better words
to convince her.

685
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,575
I know the right words.

686
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,935
They're from the books that I read.

687
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,211
Try it then, and we will see.

688
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,655
Madame Tournon,
I need to see the Duchess!

689
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,375
On behalf of the Queen.

690
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,251
She's fast asleep.

691
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,854
I'll wake her up.

692
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,478
Madame Campan already tried that.

693
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,854
Let me in.

694
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,842
She took two doses of opium
so she can sleep.

695
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,815
You know what I think?

696
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,455
I think the Queen is an evil woman.

697
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,809
She drove my mistress crazy.

698
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,295
Just the opposite,
Madame Tournon.

699
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,648
I don't need you.

700
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,735
The Queen sent you to
pick up Gabrielle?

701
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,805
None of your business!

702
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,295
Go and disassemble
the Queen's jewelry!

703
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,417
Their jewelry?

704
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,531
That's her latest whim.

705
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,375
Taking the jewels with her,
but without the bezels.

706
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,035
She says it takes up
less space in her luggage.

707
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,859
Did you do what I asked you for?

708
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:36,445
She's fast asleep.

709
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,298
Like an angel.

710
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,978
What's this?

711
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,565
I asked you to figure out
the route to Metz!

712
00:49:45,586 --> 00:49:47,586
Did you?
I guess not.

713
00:49:47,787 --> 00:49:48,615
No.

714
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,968
Bring Léonard, my hairdresser.

715
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,335
I see geography is not
your domain of expertise.

716
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,149
Léonard traveled a lot.

717
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,260
Augustine!

718
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,118
Go and call for Monsieur Léonard!

719
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,455
Mademoiselle Laborde will help me
to remove the bezels from the jewels.

720
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,346
And don't forget my son's
navy dress!

721
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,205
And my daughter's straw hat!

722
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,135
The sun gives her migraines.

723
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,180
A pearl got dropped there.

724
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,251
I'll pick it up.

725
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,737
I'll also need pots for
tea, coffee, and chocolate.

726
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,450
And my knitting needles...

727
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,915
and a spinning wheel.

728
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,565
Madame Campan,
write that down!

729
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,575
What do I know about
the nights in Metz?

730
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,389
I'll be bored to death!

731
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,463
Augustine,
help me with the bracelets!

732
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,215
She went to fetch Monsieur Léonard.

733
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,395
Where is Mademoiselle Laborde?

734
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,939
Behind you.

735
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,675
I can't find it.

736
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,213
Come here!

737
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,257
A pearl won't save us!

738
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,878
Help me take
these bracelets off!

739
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,492
Why are you crying?

740
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,709
Don't worry.
I will not forsake you.

741
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,578
I'll return soon.

742
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,175
Is it you who screamed
like a pig?

743
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,815
I fell asleep...
I needed some air.

744
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,010
We'll sleep in a real bed.

745
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,055
After his night watch
I'll straighten his mustache.

746
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,453
Come on, Gustav.

747
00:51:38,727 --> 00:51:41,265
(speaks funny in German)
Come on!

748
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,810
VERSAILLES, 16 JULY 1789

749
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:04,044
You should have seen his face ...

750
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,810
He hoped I'll scream:

751
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,975
"Your Excellency,
The Duke of Niverney!"

752
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,015
But nothing.

753
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,060
Nothing?

754
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,596
I said nothing, did nothing.

755
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,375
You chased him away?

756
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,574
He had a knife!

757
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,669
And Monsieur De Bargue?

758
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,495
He was still in
Madame De Montignac's bed!

759
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,335
Poor Madame De Bargue.
I feel sorry for her.

760
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,175
She was right:
Beggars bring the plague.

761
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,758
The guards deserted.

762
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,695
Really?
The French guards deserted?

763
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,731
Even the Swiss guards.

764
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,863
The Queen did well to leave.
- What are you saying?

765
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,935
She fled to Metz.
But that's a secret.

766
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,493
Nonsense!

767
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,815
Madame De la Tour du Pin
has just seen her.

768
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,695
She's now in the Council Hall.

769
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,894
The King sent for her early.

770
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,815
I saw her packing her stuff.

771
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,860
You must've been dreaming.

772
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,374
No more soup!

773
00:53:14,827 --> 00:53:16,355
Mademoiselle Laborde.

774
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,000
I'm embarrassed.
I usually don't drink wine...

775
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,645
Marquis De la Chesnaye found me

776
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,736
near the King's chambers.

777
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,931
Imagine this disaster!

778
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,540
If the King had seen me...

779
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,379
God, what a shame!

780
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,255
Monsieur Moreau,
do you have news from the Queen?

781
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,300
The Queen...

782
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,855
Is she in consultation with the King?

783
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,900
The King...

784
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,448
What do you know?

785
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,775
At the moment they're
at the Cabinet of the Council.

786
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,897
I saw Monsieur de Barentin.

787
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,755
Who are all those loafers in here?

788
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,608
Really...

789
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,895
Nothing works in this palace.

790
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,940
Butcher!

791
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,678
You'll pay for this!

792
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,415
Pierre Desnot.
That's no surprise.

793
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,555
What did he do?

794
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,446
Nothing.
But his brother

795
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,175
cut off the head of
the Bastille's bailiff

796
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,815
with his pocket knife.

797
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,245
But Pierre is a good guy, I know him.
- Yes.

798
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,875
Louison?

799
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,713
It's me. Sidonie.

800
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,179
Are you sleeping?

801
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,380
The clock!

802
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,140
Shit!

803
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,415
Monsieur Marquis,
have you seen Monsieur Moreau?

804
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,575
Good old Moreau!

805
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,055
I've been living in the palace
for 25 years,

806
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,408
but I never saw him like that!

807
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,017
I knew you'd be here!

808
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,935
Do you have the embroidery?

809
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,935
It's almost done.
- Perfect!

810
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,175
I need you to give back the booklet.

811
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,215
I don't want to cause trouble for
Madame De Ossun.

812
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,855
If the Queen wants to flip through it...

813
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,015
You know her...
When she wants something...

814
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:31,095
I think she has more important
problems than that.

815
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,334
The King!

816
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,655
We have to get away!

817
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,692
How can I convince you,
my brother?

818
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,015
Get up!

819
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,515
They are watching us.

820
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,042
I'm sorry, Marquis.

821
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,226
Running away is useless.

822
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,135
After listening to them, the King
will obviously stay in Versailles.

823
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,488
The members of the government.

824
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,093
The Duke De la Vauguyon,
foreign secretary,

825
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,575
Monsieur De La Porte,
secretary of the navy.

826
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,851
Monsieur De Barentin,
minister of justice.

827
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,612
No important news for your archives.

828
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:52,589
The King is going to check
the thermometer in the throne room.

829
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,020
A total disaster!

830
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,694
After much hesitation,
the King decided to stay.

831
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,255
The government of Breteuil
is dismissed.

832
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,097
Will Necker return?

833
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,779
I don't know.

834
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,057
It is not certain yet.

835
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,132
Gentlemen, we are expected to
resign to a new dynasty.

836
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,082
Louis XVI is no longer free
in his decisions.

837
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,893
He is hostage of the uprising.

838
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,158
What we will you do?

839
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,135
I'll stay with the Queen
as long as necessary.

840
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,103
This prospect...
seems to fulfill you.

841
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,638
I can't imagine my life's condition
if the Queen would leave Versailles.

842
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,162
And you, Monsieur Moreau?
- I...

843
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,389
Until my hour of death,

844
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,651
I'll take notes.

845
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,855
The situation is this:

846
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,855
The Queen is angry and has
retreated to her chamber.

847
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,135
You have to distract her with a book.
Any suggestions?

848
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,815
What about the Duchess?

849
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,937
Gabrielle is not all-powerful.
Be quick!

850
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,975
She likes
"The Dictionary of Famous Dogs".

851
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,097
Too frivolous.

852
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,935
"History of the Sky".

853
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,980
Too tedious.

854
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,015
"The Princess of Clèves" by
Madame Laffaiete.

855
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,270
Too depressing.

856
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,495
"Confessions" by Rousseau"?

857
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,002
You check with her.

858
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,255
But let me make this clear:

859
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,935
It wasn't the Queen calling for you.
It was me. I beg your discretion.

860
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,442
In the antechamber?

861
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,335
We are unpacking the luggage there.

862
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,802
With Madame De Rochereuil?

863
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:42,566
No.

864
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,322
She got fired.
The Queen caught her stealing.

865
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,775
It's always sad to lose a good friend.

866
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,743
I never had any friends at Versailles.

867
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,328
We'll enter from the backside.

868
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,282
Madame Campan!

869
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,006
Yes?

870
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,528
I have to confess something...

871
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,675
Monsieur Janvier's clock...
- Yes?

872
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,495
Louison stole it.
She left with Gustav, the Swiss guard.

873
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,935
It will be deducted from your salary.

874
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,211
Are you serious?

875
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,605
The rest of my life won't be
enough to pay for it.

876
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,705
After all...
who cares about this clock?

877
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,373
Come.

878
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,389
I longed so much for my departure...

879
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,651
Never have I longed so much
for one thing.

880
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,075
I suffered a humiliation
that is unprecedented.

881
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,611
If they had accepted the King,
you and I would be save.

882
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,733
My dear friend...

883
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,050
I've been so worried.

884
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,496
I thought you were ill.

885
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,980
Terrible ideas were lurking in my mind.

886
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,398
But now you're here.

887
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,212
Splendid.

888
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,078
How you beautiful you are
in this green dress.

889
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,329
Watery green?

890
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,697
Mellow green? Pastel green?

891
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,215
Jade green?

892
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,955
Or green like a baby crocodile?

893
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,769
You're wrong, my sweet.

894
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:03,536
Neither crocodile green, nor
spinach green, nor acid green.

895
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,889
Silk green?

896
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,882
Or green like envy?

897
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,575
Envy is the most common
thing this world.

898
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,335
Everyone covets a status
higher than their own.

899
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,995
And so they end up bumping
against the ceiling.

900
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,935
If only I could have you
always by my side.

901
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,852
You're like a
fountain of youth to me.

902
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:39,008
Have you seen all those
desolate faces?

903
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,654
Crows with a rancid smell.

904
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,736
And suddenly I saw you,

905
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,055
enchanting in your dress.

906
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,358
Light green is the color of hope.

907
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,935
Did you put it on for me?

908
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,435
Only for you, Madame.

909
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,737
You know, my dear friend...

910
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:13,860
I don't exaggerate about
the hate that surrounds us.

911
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,736
I've drawn you into this.

912
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,842
It's my fault that the people
want your head.

913
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,725
You know what I've learned from
the Council this morning?

914
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,442
Yesterday in Paris,

915
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,934
a woman had been
stabbed in her carriage.

916
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,485
The killers thought it was you.

917
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:46,895
It's not enough for them anymore
to burn us in effigy.

918
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,129
They want us...

919
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,859
in the flesh.

920
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,411
Therefore,
my dear Gabrielle,

921
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,651
I beg you...

922
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,213
Leave France!

923
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,918
You and your family.

924
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,285
You're certainly right, Madame.

925
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,845
Since it's required, I will go.

926
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:48,217
Don't say anything anymore.

927
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,739
Leave!

928
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,100
Wait!

929
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,045
Let me breathe for the last time
the scent of your youth.

930
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,045
Don't allow
that I abandon you.

931
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,533
You already did.

932
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,374
It's done.

933
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,938
You've abandoned me.

934
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:01,969
Augustine!
Go get the salts!

935
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,618
I don't need anything!

936
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,698
Or anyone!

937
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,379
Leave me alone!

938
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,739
Leave me alone.

939
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,703
What gives me this honor?

940
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,949
Usually you never come.

941
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,935
If only I knew where to go!

942
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,096
I'm as lost as you.

943
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,435
There's a spider web
in your hair.

944
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,572
I went for a walk.

945
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,368
In the attic?

946
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,546
It's raining too hard
for or a stroll on the roof.

947
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,936
Here we are...

948
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,034
Both prisoners,
you and I...

949
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,418
I've just talked to Monsieur Bailly,

950
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,776
the new mayor of Paris.

951
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,055
He was welcomed with great
enthusiasm in the town hall.

952
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,331
What did he say?

953
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,249
Something very alarming.

954
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,715
The people not only want bread,
but also power.

955
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,609
How could anyone want power?

956
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,860
For me it's a curse that
one involuntarily inherits.

957
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,615
A curse hidden
under a fur coat of ermine.

958
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,295
What else did he say?

959
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,855
That I should reinstate Necker
and tell the deputies.

960
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,219
At the town hall?

961
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:00,042
You know I hate violence.
Things have to be done properly.

962
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,569
Then we'll go together.

963
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,655
No, Madame.

964
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,055
It's the King, and only the King,
who's required to come to Paris.

965
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,290
Don't go there, please!

966
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,215
You could be assassinated
by a fanatic.

967
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,013
It's my duty.
- What duty?

968
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:20,043
To get killed? To be taken hostage?
Or to abandon your children?

969
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,335
When will you leave?
- Tomorrow.

970
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,654
Escorted?

971
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,175
Coming to Paris with my guards
would anger the people.

972
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,845
Marshal De Beauveau
and admiral D'Estain will go with me.

973
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,029
That's crazy!

974
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,986
No, Madame.
It's the voice of reason.

975
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:39,569
Is it finished?

976
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,849
Show me.

977
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,735
I didn't get a wink of sleep.

978
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,055
I need a rest.
- You can use my bed.

979
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:48,055
I'll better be in my own room.

980
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:49,869
Like a nun in her cell?

981
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,918
Why do you say that?

982
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,906
Keep it up and
you will end as a nun.

983
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,568
What about Paolo?

984
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,379
Wake up!

985
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,657
My mistress hanged herself!

986
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:01,260
Where?

987
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,098
In her bedroom.

988
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:04,852
Sidonie, I'm scared!

989
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:09,420
She's still hanging there?

990
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,118
I asked Antonin to take her down.

991
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:13,740
Antonin?

992
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:16,380
Yes.

993
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,358
We will get married.

994
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,180
Really?

995
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,814
What can I do?

996
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,525
I have to go back.

997
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,771
But I don't want to go alone.

998
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,682
Monsieur De Coigny?

999
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,177
Are you there?

1000
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,335
I am sorry for the disturbance.

1001
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,072
Don't bother,
Mademoiselle Laborde.

1002
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:16,537
Under such circumstances...

1003
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:20,655
Has it been reported to Monsieur De Bargue
that his wife is dead?

1004
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,135
Monsieur De Bargue
already left the palace.

1005
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,334
His behavior is unspeakable.

1006
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,475
It's useless to go back, Alice.
You'll stay here tonight.

1007
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,415
I can't leave Antonin alone there
with the body of Madame De Bargue!

1008
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,460
I will go.

1009
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,482
Honorine, my boots!

1010
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,414
We'll wake up abbot Herissé.

1011
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,602
Now I understand...

1012
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,775
What do you mean, Sidonie?

1013
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:58,135
Why the Queen
knocked at closed doors.

1014
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,295
Nonsense!

1015
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:03,038
She never opened or closed
a door in her life.

1016
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,535
That little man without
his cassock

1017
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,118
who carries a statue
of marble...

1018
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,928
Is that abbot Herissé
or am I seeing wrong?

1019
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,495
Your vision is all right,
Madame.

1020
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,935
It seems he was in a hurry
to change his habits.

1021
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:20,655
Don't worry.
I'll wake up the bishop then.

1022
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,392
What a pitiable sight!

1023
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,937
The Marquis De Vaucouleurs!

1024
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,088
At his age...

1025
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,303
After all, I'll join you.

1026
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,580
Doggy!

1027
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,055
I haven't seen Madame De Bargue
in a long time.

1028
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,895
But we are of the same class.
And I owe her a prayer.

1029
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,632
In your nightgown?
That's undecent.

1030
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:01,192
Before being betrayed,
Madame De Bargue was very imaginative.

1031
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
Alice...

1032
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,860
Let's go!

1033
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,495
Did you know Alice was going to marry?

1034
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,575
Sure.

1035
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,695
And he's a good catch.

1036
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:23,202
Antonin's cousin
is head servant of the King.

1037
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,015
Why doesn't anyone tell me anything?

1038
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,291
Because you don't tell us anything either.

1039
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,402
It's true.
Or where you're from?

1040
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,888
You have parents?

1041
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,211
Are they dead or alive?

1042
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,958
Where were you born?

1043
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,695
After four years
I don't know anything about you.

1044
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:51,775
A mystery!

1045
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:56,495
You read all the time.
But there are more things than books...

1046
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,889
and the Queen!

1047
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,592
She may rest in peace.

1048
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,092
Don't fall, Antonin!

1049
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:40,329
VERSAILLES, 17 JULY 1789

1050
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:41,445
God knows if they will
see each other again.

1051
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,457
You have the booklet and the embroidery?

1052
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,906
Excellent work,
Mademoiselle Laborde!

1053
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,019
Thank you.

1054
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:16,399
How's the Queen?

1055
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,284
Wait here!

1056
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,638
The important thing is to reach
Switzerland safe and sound.

1057
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,774
What do you think of my outfit,
Polignac?

1058
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:49,415
These days, a coachman keeps
his head longer than nobleman.

1059
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,691
But I never drove a carriage.

1060
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,095
This cap suits you well.

1061
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,755
Very authentic!
It's giving me frivolous ideas.

1062
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,015
Keep that remark up your buttocks,
Monsieur!

1063
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,829
My wife hates costumes.

1064
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,335
What are we waiting for?
I want to leave!

1065
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:08,075
This apron is choking me!

1066
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:10,575
My wife,
it's seems you're very nervous.

1067
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,215
Not nervous.
I'm burning with impatience, dear husband!

1068
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,655
That's charming for your beloved Queen!

1069
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,295
As you know, it was the Queen
who ordered us to leave.

1070
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,773
Can you explain?

1071
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,540
The Queen will explain it.

1072
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:24,860
Come.

1073
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,731
Deny everything she asks for.

1074
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,697
I cannot deny her anything.

1075
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,245
Well, it's none of my business.

1076
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:13,152
Mademoiselle Laborde.

1077
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,765
Come here and see.

1078
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,449
Remember?

1079
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:28,832
Two days ago I asked for
this dahlia embroidery.

1080
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:31,605
What do you think?

1081
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,448
Madame Bertin's embroiderer
is very gifted.

1082
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,855
She stitched it with love.

1083
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,697
What's her name again?

1084
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,872
Marie-Louise Berchaud.

1085
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,755
She will be rewarded.

1086
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,269
On top of that table...

1087
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,460
over there...

1088
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,575
is a handwritten speech of mine.

1089
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,930
Bring it to me, please.

1090
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,691
In case the King runs into trouble

1091
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,255
I will hold this speech
in front of the assembly.

1092
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,762
Read the beginning.

1093
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,575
"Gentlemen, I have..."

1094
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,599
No, read it loud!

1095
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,432
As if you were the Queen of France.

1096
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,371
"Gentlemen, ..."

1097
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,455
"I have come to bring you the wife"

1098
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,731
"and the family of the King."

1099
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,975
"Do not allow to separate on earth"

1100
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:59,174
"what was united in heaven."

1101
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,426
I haven't continued yet.

1102
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,295
But it's a good introduction, right?

1103
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:08,725
Very good, Madame.

1104
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,088
Do you believe he will return?

1105
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,165
With all my heart.

1106
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,469
How can I ask such stupid questions!

1107
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,094
You don't know.

1108
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,139
Nobody knows.

1109
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,175
I know he's fulfilling his duty.

1110
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,220
Shut up!

1111
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,063
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

1112
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,371
Let's talk about your future.

1113
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,215
My future is where you are, Madame.

1114
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,375
Exactly not.

1115
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,015
Soon there will be a carriage
leaving for Switzerland.

1116
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,906
You'll be going with it.

1117
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,755
Don't look like that!

1118
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,835
Two days ago you told me you'd be
ready to make any voyage for me.

1119
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,096
I grant you this privilege.

1120
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:58,254
You will escape together with
the Duke and the Duchess De Polignac.

1121
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:02,272
Gabrielle is too famous
and unfairly criticized.

1122
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,335
Without the disguise she'd risk her life.

1123
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:10,355
She will disguise as a maid
and you will put on her dress.

1124
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,862
In case the carriage gets stopped,
I want her to get away.

1125
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,736
In a way, Majesty,

1126
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,775
you ask me to be the bait.

1127
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,575
A very ugly word
from such pretty mouth!

1128
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,774
Words are everything I have.

1129
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:27,295
I know how to use them.

1130
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:32,242
Don't be so arrogant when I give you
the chance to win my favour!

1131
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,275
Madame Campan!

1132
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,629
Call for Madame Bertin.

1133
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:53,090
Yesterday I confessed
my love for Gabrielle to you.

1134
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,229
Because you deserve it.

1135
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:02,802
Has any queen ever shared
such intimacy with their reader?

1136
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,998
Almost nothing has to be altered.

1137
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,032
Take off your clothes!

1138
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,131
Take off your clothes.

1139
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,857
Madame Bertin!

1140
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:50,251
These gold coins
are for your embroiderer.

1141
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:52,251
With my compliments.

1142
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,768
That's too much, Your Majesty.

1143
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:51,689
Sidonie!

1144
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,938
Tell Gabrielle...

1145
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:07,371
that I will never forget her.

1146
01:25:30,927 --> 01:25:32,415
Mademoiselle Laborde.

1147
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,229
What are you doing?
Behave yourself.

1148
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,616
Stop it!

1149
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,189
No one should see you at the window.

1150
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:46,682
In Sens, we'll see.

1151
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,335
Your friend's plan was a bad idea.

1152
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,380
Do you know of any better?

1153
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:54,660
This masquerade will come to a bad end.

1154
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,115
Depends on how convincing
you are as a servant.

1155
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,219
Do something!

1156
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:20,372
Lie down on the seat!

1157
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:36,910
Mademoiselle Laborde.

1158
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:39,495
Do not disappoint the Queen!

1159
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,438
Where are you going?

1160
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,690
Basel, I have family there.

1161
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,979
You have a permit?

1162
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,409
Oh, it's you?

1163
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:16,660
It's me.

1164
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:24,546
I travel with my maid and my servant.

1165
01:28:36,780 --> 01:28:38,008
Bon voyage!

1166
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,457
Let them pass!

1167
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,777
<i>My name is Sidonie Laborde.</i>

1168
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,850
<i>I am an orphan.</i>

1169
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,223
<i>I was the Queen's reader.</i>

1170
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,306
<i>I am loyal to the Queen.</i>

1171
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,669
<i>Soon, I will be far from Versailles.</i>

1172
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,783
<i>Soon, I will be a nobody.</i>

1173
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:49,955
