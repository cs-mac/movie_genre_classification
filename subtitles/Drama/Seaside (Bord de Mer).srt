1
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,281
SEASIDE

2
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,570
Summer

3
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,843
You got to sleep in the end?

4
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,487
Yeah, sort of.

5
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,603
- Hi, Pierre.
- Hi, Paul.

6
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,165
Here on holiday?

7
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,203
Yes, we just got here.

8
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,088
We haven't seen you for a while.

9
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,081
I don't have much time to come.

10
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,806
So...

11
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,525
How's the job going?

12
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,802
Pretty good. I'm pleased.

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,447
We saw some of your photos
in a fashion magazine.

14
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,850
You know...

15
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,684
those models are hot.

16
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,610
Well, not bad anyhow

17
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,006
How about you?

18
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,646
I'm working as a lifeguard.

19
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,763
I should be on holiday
but I like it...

20
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,931
and the sea's nice too.

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,610
Here for a while?

22
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,485
Yes, you'll probably see me around.

23
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,806
See you.

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,490
Coming, Lilas?

25
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,410
Did you have a good night?

26
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,925
I already told you.

27
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,085
What's wrong?

28
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,041
Nothing.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,724
Did I say something wrong?

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,449
Hey, she's pretty.

31
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,603
True, Marie is pretty.

32
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,404
Go and have some fun.

33
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,762
I like to watch people dance.

34
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,891
Want another one?

35
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,130
Excuse me.

36
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,366
I'm sorry...

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,286
Mum's here.

38
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,371
- She's here?
- I'm really sick of it!

39
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,805
I'll deal With it.

40
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,245
What a bloody nerve!

41
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,249
Go home right now, please.

42
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,805
Let go of my arm.

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,365
You're hurting me!

44
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,927
Let go or I won't go home.

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,286
The pain in the ass!

46
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,130
A real pain in the ass!

47
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,528
She'll get her three lemons
one day.

48
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,290
Let me finish my cup.

49
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,850
It's ridiculous.

50
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,329
Let her have a bit of fun.

51
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,170
I'm going home.

52
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,009
- Want me to come?
- I have to be up early.

53
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,444
I'll see you home anyway.

54
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,006
I'll be fine.

55
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,802
See you.

56
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,483
I dreamt I was flying.

57
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,884
For the Taoists,

58
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,641
the ultimate freedom
is being a butterfly

59
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,726
Oh yeah?

60
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,969
Albert, your mum will be upset
if you don't pick her up.

61
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,170
Tell her I'm working.

62
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,285
It's a pity.

63
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,570
It's going to be sunny

64
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,807
Albert, Blanchard's here again.

65
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,241
The joke's gone on long enough.

66
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,121
Make sure he doesn't come back.

67
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,331
I'll try but he'll be back anyway

68
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,090
You don't know the locals.

69
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,089
Don't piss me off, okay!

70
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,486
Blanchard,
you're on early retirement.

71
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,567
There's no work for you any more.

72
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,569
You signed the paper
It's too late now.

73
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,687
Why don't you go for a swim?

74
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,651
Your dad’s never have allowed it.

75
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,209
Fives, please.

76
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,091
Just a second.

77
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,685
You smell nice.

78
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,405
Seen Marie this morning?

79
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,204
I saw her ride by.

80
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,609
She seemed to be thinking of you.

81
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,688
- How was she?
- I only saw her ride by.

82
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,009
Do you ever talk to her?

83
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,680
Yeah, sometimes.

84
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,969
Do you ever talk about me?

85
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,288
Marie's not like that.

86
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,970
That's true.

87
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,641
Paul!

88
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,405
Mum! Casino!

89
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,445
I hear you!

90
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,402
She should get herself banned,
like any big loser.

91
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,523
At roulette, not slot machines!

92
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,209
Know what I think?
If I didn't work there,

93
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,801
I'd try to get the place closed.

94
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,322
Three in a row! I got it!

95
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,681
Ten thousand!

96
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,725
I'm quitting now It's over.
I promise.

97
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,410
I'm quitting.

98
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,402
I can do oysters as a starter.

99
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,602
It's a bit much with scallops.

100
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,280
You can't open oysters anyhow

101
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,402
I thought I'd dropped my purse.

102
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,128
A bit off-color, isn't he?

103
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,529
- He should stop smoking.
- He works too much.

104
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,122
And doesn't eat properly

105
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,448
A week here will do him good.

106
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,444
I'll do sole tomorrow.
Pierre loves that.

107
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,330
What do you do in Paris?

108
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,410
Actually...

109
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,651
all kinds of odds and ends...

110
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,369
I'm still looking for myself.

111
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,325
Do you study?

112
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,010
Not much.

113
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,529
We call it Little Siberia.

114
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,769
Have you been coming here
on holiday for long?

115
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,445
Since forever.

116
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,805
A hundred years ago,
it was a very select resort.

117
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,729
My grandparents came every year.

118
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,328
I'm not in Paris right now
but it's not a problem.

119
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,648
I can be there in the morning.

120
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,441
Ah...

121
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,646
It's weird,
people in swimsuits on a beach...

122
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,081
- Are you staying all summer?
- Sure.

123
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,848
- Don't you fancy traveling?
- We can't do it all.

124
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,690
Can't you stop smoking?

125
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,282
When I work, I don't have time.

126
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,047
Do you fancy oysters for dinner?

127
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
Really?

128
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,482
I was going to get scallops.

129
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,848
Pity you're leaving so soon.

130
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,201
Coming?

131
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,010
What is it?

132
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,210
A pebble quarry

133
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,249
For souvenirs?

134
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,965
I've no idea.

135
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,326
When I was a kid,
I'd count pebbles to get to sleep.

136
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,201
Haven't you ever done photos here?

137
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,801
In the fashion business,

138
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,651
you travel far away
to be taken seriously.

139
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,451
This seems far away.

140
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,760
Hi, Marie.

141
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,361
Hello.

142
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,805
On your break?

143
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,690
Okay? Not too hot?

144
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,050
We could have dinner or lunch
some time.

145
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,529
Whatsit you tell your wife?

146
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,846
The truth.

147
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,850
- Meaning?
- That I'm seeing a colleague.

148
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,964
We're not colleagues.

149
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,164
We don't get the same pay

150
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,444
I expected Albert to come.

151
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,529
No, Odette. He's working.

152
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,722
You look really rested anyhow

153
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,843
I'm as white as a sheet!

154
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,811
That tunnel...

155
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,488
Crossing the Channel does me in.

156
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,366
It's horrible being under the water

157
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,925
Really?

158
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,122
Personally, I like the idea

159
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,209
of burrowing into the earth.

160
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,165
You still don't smoke?

161
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,327
Me?

162
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,681
I left my cigarettes on the train.

163
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,565
..It. ...too late...
to go back for them now

164
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,489
How's Albert?

165
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,971
He's okay.

166
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,651
A carton of Dunhill Reds, please.

167
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,722
It's a while since we saw her.

168
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,566
She's certainly got class.

169
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,801
- So you say.
- Exactly.

170
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,523
- At least She gets to travel.
- We worked, Denise.

171
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,524
We didn't play the tart.

172
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,204
If the boss had fancied you,

173
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,563
you wouldn't have said no.

174
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,603
Marry the boss!

175
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,882
Are you feeling all right?

176
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,848
Show a bit of respect.

177
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,884
That old goat! Honestly..

178
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,971
At least my husband
had a bit of class.

179
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,525
Still, I think she has a good life.

180
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,004
Had a good holiday?

181
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,249
London's so expensive now.

182
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,524
I stayed at the M,ridien.

183
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,166
Good service, nice and comfy.

184
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,687
I didn't want to bother your brother

185
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,365
Is he well?

186
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,601
Lovely kids...

187
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,088
How's your work going?

188
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,441
Okay.

189
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,209
You're home late.

190
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,448
Your dad worked a lot
but he was always home by six.

191
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,563
The plant went bankrupt.

192
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,529
He couldn't invest.

193
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,208
The machinery was old,
he had too many workers...

194
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,643
- But the site was a goldmine.
- So you rented it out.

195
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,403
He'd have done the same.

196
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,920
Is it that hard for you to hug me?

197
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,885
Don't be absurd.

198
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,403
This is a sight for sore eyes.

199
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,809
These journeys exhaust me.

200
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,800
I'd never have done dinner for myself.

201
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,331
The pleasure's mine.

202
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,845
Don't worry. She's a dreamer.

203
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,764
I'm not worried.

204
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,124
Let's go to the beach.

205
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,290
Don't you think he sees
enough of the beach?

206
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,810
Let's sit down.

207
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,281
I don't like
the bathing huts at night.

208
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,008
A dog'll pee on you one day!

209
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,888
I want to live with you.

210
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,251
What for?

211
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,811
What for?

212
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,090
Just say yes or no.
I can't go on like this.

213
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,525
Winter

214
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,965
Did you sleep well?

215
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,323
Think I'm fat?

216
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,010
You're my sister.

217
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,643
Have you seen mum today?

218
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,010
- We need to see to her heating.
- 500 francs won't kill us.

219
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,005
Cold, isn't it?

220
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,127
We used to freeze on the sorting bench,
your mum and me.

221
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,641
Paul!

222
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,490
Is Rose all right?

223
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,961
Yeah, she's okay.

224
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,810
It can't always
have been easy for her.

225
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,691
No, it's okay.

226
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,568
If there's anything I can do...

227
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,369
Give them this
to keep the bailiffs away.

228
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,881
I'll see to the heater myself.

229
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,889
Why don't you ask Odette?

230
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,961
Rose?

231
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,007
It's Odette.

232
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,842
You're being stupid now

233
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,209
It's been so long, Rose!

234
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,289
Exactly! What's got into her?

235
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,169
She's like my dog.
He knows when I'm not happy

236
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,325
Go now
or you'll miss your soap.

237
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,649
Total absence...

238
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,245
State corresponding to a total absence
"of real particles."""

239
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,130
In four letters.

240
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,442
I respect your mother.

241
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,008
She fought for your job
when we bought your father's firm.

242
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,282
You don't seem happy here.

243
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,086
My great-grandfather
founded this firm.

244
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,643
World leader in sea pebbles
from father to son.

245
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,488
Why did you choose this job?

246
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,849
Out of heredity

247
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,250
No, I don't know.

248
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,210
Out of politeness.

249
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,007
Does my contract end
in three months or now?

250
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,044
Now, I think.
Another guy will be happy here.

251
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,083
- You've found someone?
- Yes.

252
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,449
Make it three months.

253
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,363
Blanchard's in the yard.

254
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,611
What's new?

255
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,888
I'd like to go away with you.

256
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,730
- I'm leaving my job.
- you always say that.

257
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,685
You know,
your mother doesn't need you.

258
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,009
You can waste your whole life
on others.

259
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,408
So why do you stay with me?

260
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,170
Because I love you.

261
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,325
I wait for you to change but you don't.

262
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,647
We're all waiting for something.

263
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,448
She's mortgaged her house.

264
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,441
Now your pension's gone,
you had to gamble the house away?

265
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,331
We keep telling you
no one ever wins!

266
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,525
I just thought I was bound
to hit the jackpot in the end.

267
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,563
Casinos are for the rich.

268
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,728
Play if you can afford to lose

269
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,169
Whatsit you do now?

270
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,929
I'll find a place to rent.

271
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,285
What With?

272
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,525
You're broke!

273
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,329
Don't look so grim!

274
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,329
It's not that serious.

275
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,527
We don't have a dog.
She can sleep on the couch.

276
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,691
What's up?
Are you crazy too?

277
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,729
It's nothing. It happens.

278
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,007
It's all so serious with him.

279
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,603
It's not because of you.

280
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,967
200,000 francs in slot machines!

281
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,685
Just think!

282
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,169
Early retirement's driven her
round the bend.

283
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,849
She doesn't like TV

284
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,923
What else can she do here?

285
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,803
Right, I have to get back.

286
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,169
Maybe I'll come to see you.

287
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,006
Hey, Albertine! You know what?

288
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,281
You look like a star!

289
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,726
The dresser will look good
at your sister's.

290
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,447
One more house to sell in Cayeux.

291
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,691
That's your inheritance gone.

292
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,369
You should have thought of that.

293
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,964
No more gambling now

294
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,044
I'm sick of it.

295
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,165
You think it's funny!

296
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,248
I had a few drinks with your sister

297
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,969
It cheered us up.

298
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,527
They're doing fashion photos!

299
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,245
We're going to see.

300
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,044
Maybe I'll join you.

301
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,291
It's a tough life,
always on the move.

302
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,571
Not many of them make the big time.

303
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,603
Not the prettiest either.

304
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,043
Wow, it's pretty dead here.

305
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,406
When I was a kid,
it felt like the moon.

306
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,283
- Twenty years, right?
- Yes, twenty.

307
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,641
Already?

308
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,810
Time flies
and we're not getting younger

309
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,287
I hope I'll get the champagne.

310
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,609
After twenty years,
I got the champagne,

311
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,003
a nice bouquet of flowers
and an envelope.

312
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,884
I hope I get all that too.

313
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,320
I think so.

314
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,366
Okay?

315
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,929
Did things change
when the firm was sold?

316
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,525
Not for me because I kept my job.

317
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,960
No one cares when an old family firm
gets swallowed up.

318
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,084
<i>A boss is a boss.</i>

319
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,522
The bonuses aren't any better

320
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,889
You're drinking, Lucille!

321
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,289
It warms you up, right?

322
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,165
What's wrong, mum?

323
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,001
Nothing.

324
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,165
- How's the plant?
- I won't be staying.

325
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,569
Really? Why not?

326
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,208
There's a new albumen bearing.

327
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,121
It's a 100%-sure grinding agent.

328
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,290
There are always some impurities
in pebbles.

329
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,881
It's a lot more expensive now

330
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,560
but the costs will soon drop.

331
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,330
You believe that?

332
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,925
Raw material costs are down.

333
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,009
Aluminium is worth nothing.

334
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,127
You know your brother
has a new apartment?

335
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,402
He has? That's great.

336
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,650
What a success!

337
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,410
What a success...

338
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,530
I wanted you to have
a good education,

339
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,409
and go to university

340
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,204
After, you were free.

341
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,569
- Want some coffee?
- No.

342
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,928
It's a good idea
to look for a new job elsewhere.

343
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,249
Spring

344
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,800
Work: problems to sort out,

345
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,889
deal with the most urgent now

346
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,209
The rest will fall into place.
Romance:

347
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,721
old feelings return to the fore.

348
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,889
You thought it was all over
but the heart is a surprising hunter

349
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,881
"Health: migraines possible."""

350
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,402
Coffee with milk, please.

351
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,409
- Are you well?
- I'm okay.

352
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,165
How's your son?

353
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,609
I'm going to be a grandmother

354
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,447
That's nice.

355
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,089
I can still see the two of you
paddling in the water all day

356
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,685
We were only little.
It was long ago.

357
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,082
It feels like yesterday to me.

358
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,527
Good bye.

359
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,723
You've got a nerve,
staring at people like that!

360
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,166
I'm sorry?

361
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,090
I caught too many.

362
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,930
We'll give the rest away.

363
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,285
Does it hurt?

364
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,170
It's nothing.

365
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,489
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

366
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,722
- Has something upset you?
- No.

367
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,331
You're not coming?

368
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,400
My head's spinning.

369
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,125
Can I help?

370
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,569
I don't feel well.

371
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,685
I'm going home.

372
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,163
Take your things with you.

373
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,922
What are the pebbles used for?

374
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,127
To make washbasins, I think.

375
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,486
Things like that.
Bathroom fittings...

376
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,129
- Ceramics?
- That's right.

377
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,123
What do you do exactly?

378
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,571
Basically,
we take the unsorted pebbles

379
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,808
and the machine sorts them.

380
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,686
Then the girls sort them again.

381
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,644
Some pebbles are no good?

382
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,760
They wouldn't need us otherwise

383
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,482
Some are oxidized or broken
so we dump those.

384
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,480
- Where?
- Back in the sea.

385
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,081
The tide brings them back later

386
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,687
The oxidized ones can get cleaned.

387
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,090
If the oxide's not too deep,
the friction can clean them up.

388
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,885
But not all of them.

389
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,731
There you are...

390
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,082
Where do all the pebbles go?

391
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,050
All over the world.

392
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,607
Asia, I think. Italy.

393
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,565
Everywhere, in fact.

394
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,648
I've been coming here
since I was a baby and I didn't know

395
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,363
It doesn't matter.

396
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,888
I'm seeing you everywhere today.

397
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,410
It's not hard in a place this small.

398
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,687
True.

399
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,726
I felt like taking a walk...
Not very cheerful, is it?

400
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,161
Ever thought of leaving?

401
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,126
The shrimp turns pink
when it hits the boiling water

402
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,531
Are you hungry?

403
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,924
Do you remember Marie?

404
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,091
The girl who used to play with Pierre?

405
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,526
She works at the pebble plant.

406
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,090
She's a worker.

407
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,681
Really?

408
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,568
If one gets out alive,
we'll call him Super Shrimp.

409
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,926
He), grandma!

410
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,724
Lost your sense of humor?

411
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,206
You piss me off with your shrimps!

412
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,728
The stones are tough.

413
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,163
Sometimes, I was fit to drop.

414
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,088
Turn the fuckingT\/ down.

415
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,565
We're chatting
and we didn't even notice.

416
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,610
When it's not him, it's her

417
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,007
There's always something wrong.

418
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,322
It takes guts and sex
to keep a relationship going.

419
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,122
Maybe they just need to be alone
for a while.

420
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,728
Why don't you come back home?

421
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,284
Or go and see Odette.

422
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,167
She could easily afford the house.

423
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,403
It's a lovely hotel.

424
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,210
Very relaxing.

425
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,482
They wait on you hand and foot.

426
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,091
And it's very young...

427
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,810
- a very young atmosphere.
- I'm not sure, okay.

428
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,887
Why don't you book the tickets

429
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,370
then decide
whether to come or not?

430
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,209
You can do what you like...

431
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,005
but South America gets booked up fast.

432
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,286
Cheers.

433
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,369
Have you found a new job?

434
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,324
I'm not really looking.

435
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,728
You don't really need to work?

436
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,562
I'm taking the time to think.

437
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,442
Careful,
thinking can give you a headache.

438
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,809
You're not at the plant?

439
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,129
I felt sick earlier.

440
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,890
Feeling better now?

441
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,690
Sort of.

442
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,211
Actually, everything's the way
I don't want it to be.

443
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,930
Lucille's at work.

444
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,803
Amiens was dull enough
but this place...

445
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,170
is deadly.

446
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,611
We have the sea.

447
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,407
You'd need to clear the beach.

448
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,887
Tourists won't come to this dump.

449
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,650
Except for yobs.

450
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,164
A beach

451
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,044
is an expanse of sand.

452
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,250
You need to be able
to walk on in it heels

453
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,689
and an evening dress
like a movie star!

454
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,442
We had some English buyers today

455
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,524
I've run you a bath.

456
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,884
Can you watch the pasta?

457
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,721
Marie?

458
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,725
Are you with Marie?

459
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,482
Have you been at the casino?

460
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,762
No, I went to see Denise.

461
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,371
Where are you going?

462
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,926
Three?

463
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,645
Seventy-eight?

464
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,726
Where were you?

465
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,242
- She was asleep.
- No one asked you.

466
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,484
It's true, I was asleep.

467
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,687
Two hours I've been looking for you!

468
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,530
Maybe, but I was asleep.

469
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,369
You could have told me.

470
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,729
You were bound to find me
if I stayed put.

471
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,441
That's what we thought.
Right, Rose?

472
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,604
What are you playing?

473
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,880
Lotto.

474
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,568
I'm serious. I was worried.

475
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,241
You should have looked upstairs.

476
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,611
I was asleep.

477
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,289
Now you piss everyone off
and make me look dumb!

478
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,328
You've never trusted me anyway.

479
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,085
Get out of here.

480
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,445
Go on, piss off!

481
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,288
You're both so complicated.

482
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,801
My woman...

483
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,330
Have you seen her?

484
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,288
- Who's your woman?
- Marie.

485
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,362
I've seen no one.

486
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,486
He's an odd bloke.

487
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,368
It can't be easy for him.

488
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,483
I'm not going to pity him.

489
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,644
Summer

490
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,044
Attention, please!

491
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,605
No swimming allowed.

492
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,689
No swimming today.

493
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,610
Really? Why?

494
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,248
There's a shark in the bay.

495
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,691
A shark?

496
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,402
A shark? Here?

497
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,166
It's for safety's sake.

498
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,204
If I was Paul,
I couldn't talk to her

499
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,848
After what her son did.

500
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,284
Don't you agree?

501
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,689
She isn't her son.

502
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,524
What did she say?

503
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,563
Nothing. Not a word.

504
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,244
You'll be busy
with a thing like that out there.

505
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,051
Are you helping me?

506
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,607
You and your bloody knitting!

507
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,241
You should try it.
It keeps you busy.

508
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,845
What a lovely day...

509
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,486
Are you okay?

510
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,926
Fine, yes.

511
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,808
Have you had sharks before?

512
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,330
Not that I know of.

513
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,887
I'm scared enough without them.

514
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,403
Did you see jaws?

515
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,005
It's been on TV a lot.

516
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,489
It made me too scared to swim out far.
I stay in the shallows.

517
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,480
I wonder if it's instinct
or because of the film.

518
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,801
When you can't see things,
your imagination runs wild.

519
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,524
Can I sit up there?

520
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,407
Okay?

521
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,326
Sorry.

522
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,727
<i>There are reports of a shark in the bay.</i>

523
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,811
Lovely, isn't it?

524
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,081
Hey...

525
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,966
That's good.
He's seeing girls again.

526
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,086
Yes, but...

527
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,844
What's going on here?

528
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,848
Deep-sea fishing, huh?

529
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,488
What do you mean exactly?

530
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,402
- How far gone?
- Six months.

531
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,685
No, you go-

532
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,921
- have you had a fight?
- No, not at all.

533
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,009
She just wants to be alone.

534
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,610
Funny isn't she?

535
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,050
That's a nice costume.

536
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,250
Yes, I like it.

537
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,811
Okay up there?

538
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,730
Fine, thanks.

539
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,850
Were you born here?

540
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,130
It's funny...

541
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,289
Where's that girl
who was with you last year?

542
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,485
She's not here.

543
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,921
Well...

544
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,611
She left.

545
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,762
No one's heard from her.

546
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,122
I mean, I just don't get it.

547
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,726
- What if She came back?
- They drove each other mad.

548
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,447
Where's your daughter again?

549
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,165
In Brittany.

550
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,686
A pity she's missing the shark.

551
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,281
Maybe it'll be here
when she gets back.

552
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,649
You never go away?

553
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,129
She's right. Why don't you?

554
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,970
- Hello, Odette.
- How Are you?

555
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,960
- And yourself?
- very well. you look fantastic.

556
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,321
We were in Antibes.

557
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,766
- For long?
- Two weeks.

558
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,803
Two weeks, that's good.

559
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,367
- How's it been here?
- Oh, I like it.

560
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,643
I keep out of the sun, you know

561
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,286
- I'm allergic.
- It can be bad For you.

562
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,683
- Come to dinner on Saturday
- Lovely. see you then.

563
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,525
How are you?

564
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,486
I'm fine.

565
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,160
And yourself?

566
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,729
A bit of circulation trouble
but I can't complain.

567
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,367
It comes from working standing up
all those years.

568
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,730
So they say.

569
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,449
Any news from your son?

570
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,205
He's traveling at the moment,
I think.

571
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,371
Do you know...

572
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,686
if the girl's with him?

573
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,120
Yes, I think so.

574
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,891
Actually, I'm not sure.

575
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,168
I'd like to know how she is.

576
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,362
If you hear, let me know.

577
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,007
It's odd, my daughter-in-law

578
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,044
well, my ex-daughter-in-law,
stays in touch.

579
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,442
She's found a good job in Paris.

580
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,602
I'm glad she's happy

581
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,051
Have a nice day, Rose.

582
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,321
You too.

583
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,809
It scares me, you know.

584
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,241
You're young. That's good.

585
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,607
In any case, she loves you.

586
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,162
So try not to spoil it.

587
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:29,041
Why do you always have to say things
that piss me off?

588
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,806
I just want you to be happy

589
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,640
- How Are you?
- Can't complain, and you?

590
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,966
Fine, thanks.

591
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,323
Heard about the shark?

592
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,931
You bet I have.

593
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,645
Everyone's talking about it.

594
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,205
We've come to see it.

595
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,091
Like in the film!

596
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,764
It's probably harmless.

597
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,168
Whites, blues, hammerheads...

598
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:04,284
Not many are dangerous.

599
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,770
- I saw some... from a ship once.
- It's probably a basking shark.

600
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,363
They're not the same on TV.

601
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,245
The liver's their weak point.

602
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,046
They've been on earth
400 million years.

603
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,129
I think bees kill more people.

604
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,446
Really?

605
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,211
- It's 7 feet long.
- It's huge!

606
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,045
Shit!

607
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,400
You can't stay here sulking like this.

608
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,286
What?

609
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,203
You'll get over it.

610
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,005
I'm fine.

611
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,885
Don't worry about me.

612
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,922
She needed to be taken away

613
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,522
I was too dumb to see it.

614
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,890
Did you want to leave too?

615
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,206
What's on your mind?

616
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,765
I'm thinking.

617
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,805
What about?

618
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,605
This place.

619
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,851
And?
