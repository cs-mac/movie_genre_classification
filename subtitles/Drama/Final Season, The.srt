1
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,379
Move, move, move.

2
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Tell me again why we chose this
over seeing the movie.

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,378
If these guys lose focus
for even a millisecond...

4
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,081
...you have to scrape them off the fence
with a shovel.

5
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,783
You come hoping to see a crash?

6
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,784
No, I would like to see them complete--
Of course it's to see a crash.

7
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,487
-You're sick, Hunt.
-Come on!

8
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,499
Look, here comes Nick with our stuff.

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,801
-Hey, bud.
-There he is.

10
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,803
Yes.

11
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,804
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,175
Oh, my God. Ha, ha.

13
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,577
-Uh, time to lay off the Funyuns, Nicky boy.
-Oh, thanks, buddy.

14
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,816
- Ah, great.
- Yeah! All right!

15
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,619
-Oh, my God.
-Oh. Here. Want a drink?

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,620
-Oh. Is that straight-up Jack?
-It's his buddy Jim.

17
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,025
- Maybe later, yeah?
- Hey, sport.

18
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,793
Can my girl use your binoculars?

19
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,794
Well, they're not really binoculars exactly.
They're more--

20
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,034
Drink as much as you like.

21
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,039
Go, go, go.

22
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,978
Whoa. Easy, fellas.

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,979
Craig Perry shuts the door
as Mark Helfrich tries to overtake him.

24
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,219
Hey, thanks for making me
take a study break.

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,220
I really, really needed this.

26
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,826
Excuse me. Pardon me.

27
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,901
That was a close call..

28
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,739
Well, great. What did I just miss?

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,740
-Can you see, ma'am?
-I'm sorry, not really.

30
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,077
-Would you like me to move down a bit?
-Would you mind?

31
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,681
-Be glad to.
-Thanks, man.

32
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,682
-Thank you.
-And I thought chivalry was dead.

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,851
Heh. That's not true.
I have my cowboy right here.

34
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,922
Get a room, guys.

35
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,598
Hey. Put these in.

36
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,934
-Oh, Mom, not tampons.
-Put these-- Put them in.

37
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,935
Nick. Nick.

38
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,773
- This tickles.
- Aw, Mom.

39
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,743
- No, no, no.
- She put tampons in their ears.

40
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,078
That's just wrong, man.

41
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,580
I can't see now.

42
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,515
Hey, down in front, asshole.

43
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,516
Approaching the halfway point.

44
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,792
There goes the neighborhood.

45
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,364
Sir.

46
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,365
I need you to move your foot. Thank you.

47
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,149
Hey, how old is this place?

48
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,150
You got me.

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,320
- Come on, let's go.
- Go, go, go.

50
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,090
Tire up.

51
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,091
What's that?

52
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,295
Is it safe to sit here?

53
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,296
Of course. There's a fence there.
We're fine.

54
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,299
Relax.

55
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,205
Replay of the
Camping World Regional Series race...

56
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:11,275
...is on the Replay Race Channel
at 3p.m.

57
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,711
Did you feel that?

58
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,913
Just now, right here.

59
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,415
You okay?

60
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,416
Uh, I felt something touch me.
Something strange.

61
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,087
For those of you
with a business-minded head...

62
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,758
Go, go.

63
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,329
Come on, come on, come on.

64
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,903
- Two's good.
- Go, go, go.

65
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,939
No, no, no, wait! The screwdriver! Shit!

66
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,310
Oh.

67
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,485
Come on, come on. Let's go, go, go!

68
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,656
Come on.

69
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,163
Move!

70
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,839
Go. Get the fuck out of here.

71
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,646
- Come on.
- Boys, wait!

72
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,647
Come on, Mom.

73
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,019
Mom!

74
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,872
Hey! Hey! There's an exit this way!

75
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,873
Come on, move.

76
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,391
-Hunt!
-Janet!

77
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,894
- Let's move. Come on.
- There's an exit over here. Come on.

78
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,868
Come on, come on! This way! Run!

79
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,136
- Lori!
- Move!

80
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,414
Lori. Lori, come on, let's go!
Get out of here!

81
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,415
Move! Push through!

82
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,756
Come on!

83
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,899
Ow. Hey. What the hell?

84
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,504
Are you okay?

85
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,505
Nick, is there something wrong?

86
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,109
Oh, my God, is that straight-up Jack?

87
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,110
-No, no, it's his--
-His buddy Jim.

88
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,247
You have been in my stash. You snake.

89
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,619
A cowboy in a hat. He sits here.

90
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,388
Excuse me. Pardon me.

91
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,357
Oh, ha, ha.

92
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,226
Cowboy.

93
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,096
Tampons. She gets tampons.
She puts them in her kids' ears.

94
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,131
-Who?
-Her, right there.

95
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,567
Hey. Put these in your ears.

96
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,303
- Oh, Mom, not tampons.
- Put them in your ear.

97
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,472
Hey, how did you know
she was gonna do that?

98
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,308
That's a lot of tampons for one woman.

99
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,309
Nick? Nick. What's going on?

100
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,415
"Down" something. "Down...
Down in-- Down in front, asshole."

101
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,919
Down in front, asshole.

102
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,157
There goes the neighborhood.

103
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,894
Sir. I need you to move your foot.

104
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,267
Thank you.

105
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,069
- Let's go.
- Move it.

106
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,070
Go. Pick up the tire.

107
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,475
That's the car that's gonna crash.

108
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,510
-We have to get out of here.
-Thank God.

109
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,246
-What? No, no. I got $500 on this race.
-No one cares--

110
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,247
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
We're gonna die. There's gonna be a crash.

111
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,619
Hey, kid, that ain't funny.

112
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,188
-We gotta go right now. We gotta move.
-Relax, Nick.

113
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,189
- Nick, calm down.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,993
What's your problem, bro?
Get off of me, man.

115
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,198
-Come on, let's go.
-Wait. Boys, wait!

116
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,468
I'm gonna kick your little ass, you pussy!

117
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,206
Goddamn it!

118
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,975
God, you little punk.

119
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,976
-Andy.
-Stay there.

120
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,716
- Come back here, kid!
- Hey, you little prick!

121
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,154
- Are you out of your mind?
- I saw the whole thing.

122
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,689
-There's gonna be a crash.
-Of course there's a crash.

123
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,057
There's always a fucking crash.

124
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What crash?

125
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,564
That fucking crash.
That's what crash I'm talking about.

126
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,567
Are you shitting me? That's the reason
I come to these stupid redneck things.

127
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,038
No offense.

128
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,039
-Sir. No, no, no--
-But my wife's in there, asshole!

129
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,744
- No, you can't.
- Let me go! I gotta find her!

130
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,913
- Dude, relax.
- That's my wife!

131
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,748
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

132
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,749
Have you all lost your fucking mind?

133
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,921
Ew!

134
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,121
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

135
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,492
-Just a second.
-That's okay.

136
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,342
Nick, was it like a dream
or like a voice in your head?

137
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,179
I just... I just saw it.

138
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,883
-Can we just try to forget about it?
-Are you kidding?

139
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,121
I am never gonna get that image
out of my head.

140
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,122
-I mean, that girl's face just--
-Janet. Look, I know it's difficult.

141
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,859
-We're all a little freaked out, okay?
-But why are we still alive?

142
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,998
Who cares why? Okay?

143
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,999
If we made it, we deserved it.

144
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,404
Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin shit
a rest, please?

145
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,309
Guys, look.

146
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,722
- l think we should go to the memorial.
- I can't.

147
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,026
-l can't go back.
-Yeah, screw that.

148
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,428
We can pay our respects to those people.

149
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,996
What people?

150
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,997
People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with
them to tell them to get out of the way?

151
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,901
People who didn't have one of these?

152
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,374
Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it.

153
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,375
It's your choice, heads or tails,
but you know I like head.

154
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,745
-Can't believe I ever went out with you.
-Can't believe you were so lucky.

155
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,516
Guys, look. We're here.

156
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,453
All right?
Something gave us a second chance...

157
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,790
...so let's be thankful
and just try to make the most of it.

158
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,727
Okay?

159
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,666
Come on, let's go.

160
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,449
-You okay?
-Yeah.

161
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,184
Okay.

162
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,019
Hi.

163
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,121
Hi, I was hoping you'd come.

164
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,122
I wanted to thank you. You're a hero.

165
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,692
Because of your warning,
we're alive and our two sons are safe.

166
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,995
Look, I'm not a hero, okay? I-- I didn't--

167
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,534
You knew.

168
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,535
How did you know it was gonna happen?

169
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,372
- I'm not sure.
- Look, we're just glad you all are okay.

170
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,711
Take care.

171
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,380
Thank you.

172
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,616
I'm glad you're safe.

173
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,617
Thank you.

174
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,122
Excuse me.

175
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,123
I'm, uh, the security guard. George.

176
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,994
Nick.

177
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,195
Lori.

178
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,830
-Hi.
-Hi.

179
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,666
I was pretty freaked out about that
back there.

180
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,667
-l just wanted to ask you how you--
-You killed my wife.

181
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,241
I wanted to go in there after her, but...

182
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,579
...you, uh...

183
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,580
I'm sorry for your loss.

184
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,486
Well...

185
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,855
...nobody lives forever, nigger.

186
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,856
-Hey, there's no need for that, man.
-Back off, you fucking freak.

187
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,194
It's time for you to leave, sir.

188
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,565
Time?

189
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,936
Your time's coming, chocolate.

190
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,076
What's wrong?

191
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,811
I just had a really bad nightmare.

192
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,281
It's okay, it's just a dream.

193
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,282
It seemed real.

194
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
Just try to relax and go back to sleep.

195
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,489
I'm right here.

196
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,268
Son of a bitch.

197
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,974
Hey, Ma. It's late.
What are you doing up?

198
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,713
Okay.

199
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,714
No, no, no, everything's fine.
Yeah, it's fine.

200
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,855
Okay.

201
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,041
Time's up.

202
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,012
Goddamn it.

203
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,295
I'll burn you.

204
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,465
she probably wasn't...

205
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,661
No, no, no! Fuck!

206
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,634
Help me! Help!
Wake up, please, anybody!

207
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,506
Please, I'm on fire! It's burning!

208
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:21,177
Oh, my God.

209
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,793
My ass is on fire! My ass is on fire!

210
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,495
My God! My ass is on fire!

211
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,298
-Hey, babe, what's up?
-Hey, Lori. Turn on Channel 7 right now.

212
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,536
You remember that redneck
from the racetrack?

213
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:47,537
-He's dead.
-What?

214
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,440
Yeah, hold on.

215
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,209
--from the freak accident.

216
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,210
Although the investigation
is still ongoing...

217
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,481
...paramedics pronounced Daniels dead
on the scene.

218
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,715
Nick, get in here.

219
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,051
A member of local PTA and NRA chapters...

220
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,720
...Carter Daniels lived quietly
in Fort Wayne.

221
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,223
Details are sketchy
on how Daniels was killed.

222
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:08,224
All that is known at this time
is that a tow truck dragged him...

223
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,995
...down a residential street
before the truck exploded.

224
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,996
- Wanna hear something freaky?
- Carter's wife was killed...

225
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,201
I've seen that door before.

226
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,736
More to come on our nightly news.

227
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,737
And now we'll checkin
with our eye in the sky...

228
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,385
Hey, hey, I gotta go. I'll call you back.

229
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,386
Okay, bye.

230
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,826
What is it? What's wrong?

231
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,827
Remember that dream I had last night?

232
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,398
I-- I don't think it was a dream.
It was like...

233
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,769
It was like a vision.

234
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,106
I mean, there were flames,
and there was a hook...

235
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,943
...and that red door.

236
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,447
And now that racist guy is dead.

237
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,017
It was like I saw clues
as to how he was gonna die.

238
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,625
Just now I saw another one.

239
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,626
Wait, wait, you saw how another person
was gonna die?

240
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,797
-Who was it?
-I don't know.

241
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,798
It doesn't make any sense.
Nothing makes any sense.

242
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,801
Ever since I left the racetrack, I feel
like there's something in the room with me.

243
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,876
What is happening to me?

244
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,248
- You're early today.
- Oh, yeah, light load.

245
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,662
Hey, look. Come here.

246
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,433
-Bet you can't hit that sign with a rock.
-Okay.

247
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,434
[BOTH GRUNT

248
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,283
Oh, ha, ha, yeah.

249
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,185
Okay, okay, knock it off.

250
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,353
- Yes!
- Hey.

251
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,587
Nice one.

252
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,290
Hey, what are you kids,
stupid or something?

253
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,291
Get out of here.

254
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,294
Okay, come here, guys. Um--

255
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,132
I want you to go play video games.
Come back in an hour.

256
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
- All right!
- You're welcome.

257
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,169
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Mom.

258
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,538
- I'm first on "Atomic Destroyer."
- No, I am.

259
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,642
Hi, Cheyenne, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a 5:00 with Richard.

260
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,811
Oh, you didn't get our message?

261
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,879
-Richard's out today.
-What?

262
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Someone got killed on his block.
Dragged down the street on fire.

263
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,851
-Isn't that terrible?
-That's awful.

264
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,389
So my appointment?
Is there someone else that can see me?

265
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Um, it's 10 to 6, and we close at 6,
so, ha-ha-ha...

266
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,498
I understand, but the soccer game ran late,
and it's girls' night out tonight...

267
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,304
...first time in months,
and I'm so looking forward to this.

268
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,873
-Please. Please.
-Um--

269
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,209
-Look at this.
-You're killing me.

270
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,210
Thank you. Ah, thank you so much.

271
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,753
Excuse me, that's--

272
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,423
That is a little-- That's a little tight.

273
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,591
- Ahem.
- Uh.

274
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,592
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

275
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,729
So, Dee Dee, thank you for staying late.
How long have you been cutting hair?

276
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,236
Long enough.

277
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,407
Goddamn chair.

278
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,842
I've only told them to fix it
like a million times.

279
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,118
- Oh, Dee Dee?
- Yeah?

280
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,987
Could I please get some water?

281
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,988
- No problem.
- Thank you.

282
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,310
- How's it going?
- Almost done.

283
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,619
I love the color. It's exactly honey.

284
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,256
Do you think?

285
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,578
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

286
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,514
It won't happen again.

287
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,551
It's okay.

288
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,552
Wow.

289
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,689
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

290
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,990
Whoa.

291
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,991
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Cut it out.

292
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,741
- Thanks, Dee Dee.
- You're welcome.

293
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,743
Hope you have fun.

294
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,248
-Stop.
-Okay, guys, knock it off.

295
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,951
I am so sorry about this.

296
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,952
These guys aren't gonna leave my sight
until I ship them to college.

297
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,255
-Maybe military school?
-Ha, yeah, maybe.

298
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,625
All right, boys, come on.

299
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,230
Let's go. Get in the car.

300
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,231
I've got my eye on you two.

301
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,310
Oh, my God!

302
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,551
It's that lady with the kids,
from the racetrack.

303
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,458
We just lost a really hot MILF.

304
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,593
-Dude, this is serious.
-Yeah.

305
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,594
Don't you think it's weird
that two of the people Nick saved are dead?

306
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,998
Weird is putting tampons in your kids' ears.
That's weird.

307
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,002
She was bound to die sooner or later.

308
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,003
That's actually why we asked you guys
to come over.

309
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,172
The night before it happened,
Nick had a really strange dream.

310
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,411
Great. I'm glad I cancelled my golf game
for this. Good.

311
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,912
But it wasn't a dream.

312
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,913
It was like these random sounds
and images.

313
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,317
They really didn't make any sense.
And then I read what killed them...

314
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,920
...and I realized that I'd seen
how the next person was gonna die.

315
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,692
Wait, what do you mean,
"the next person"?

316
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,693
Okay, don't laugh,
but we stayed up Googling premonitions...

317
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,964
...visions, signs, things like that, just to see
how much information we could get.

318
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,270
There are tons of articles about people...

319
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,372
...who had a premonition
about a disaster...

320
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,042
...they saved themselves...

321
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,376
...and then they died.

322
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,046
Okay, so people died. So what?

323
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,315
Every survivor died.

324
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,217
In the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident.

325
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,219
Well, we survived.

326
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,220
So now does that mean we all die?

327
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,059
-Well, who's next?
-I don't remember.

328
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,964
But there might be an out.

329
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,334
Some say the chain can be broken.

330
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,335
Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death...

331
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,571
...that would end it.

332
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,307
But others say
unless the chain is broken completely...

333
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,308
...then you're just changing the batting
order, and sooner or later, you're up.

334
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,748
That is some spooky psychobabble shit.

335
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,184
shut up, please. This is not funny.

336
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,185
-He could be watching a ton of TV.
-You know what this does to me.

337
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,421
It's okay. All we're trying to do
is figure out what's going on.

338
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,992
You are gonna have to
figure that out without me.

339
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,993
You can call me later, but I gotta go.
Hope you have fun.

340
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,031
Janet, come back. Don't leave.

341
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,166
No, Lori. No.
You guys are freaking me out.

342
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,769
What's with that?
She went from uptight but normal...

343
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,437
...to uptight and totally insane.

344
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,207
Why do you gotta be a prick?
She saw somebody die.

345
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,943
- So did we.
- Yeah, and we're all freaked out.

346
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,944
Would it kill you to be sensitive?

347
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,348
I don't know.

348
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,617
I've never tried it.

349
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,052
Where are you going?

350
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,053
If you're right
about this whole crash thing...

351
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,390
...then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.

352
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,459
I'm gonna go get laid.

353
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,865
If I'm dying, I'm trying.

354
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,866
Keep up the good fight, guys.

355
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
And if I happen to bump into Janet,
I will check on her.

356
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,445
Thanks.

357
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,229
Well, that went well.

358
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,230
Yeah, our friends think we're crazy.
It's great.

359
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,468
Well, maybe we are.

360
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,469
Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.

361
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,574
You think?

362
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,945
I hope so.

363
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,658
Nick? What did you see?

364
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,795
-l think we can stop it.
-How?

365
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,199
We gotta go to the racetrack.

366
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,876
Oh, my God.

367
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,845
Look at this place.

368
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,214
All those people just...

369
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,816
- l don't wanna be here.
- I know, I know.

370
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,817
But this is the only thing that I can think of
to help me remember the order.

371
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,722
It's over here. This is where we were.

372
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,466
Let's see if this works.

373
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,371
The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.

374
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,981
Then that racist and his wife.

375
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,663
That woman with the kids, she was next.

376
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,872
Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go.

377
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,385
I can't remember who dies when.

378
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,954
-It's okay.
-I don't know what to do. I can't--

379
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,623
Maybe this was a really bad idea.

380
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,593
No.

381
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,594
I gotta try.

382
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,133
You better have a damn good reason
for trespassing.

383
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,435
I just need to remember the order.

384
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,436
Young man, that sounds crazy.
But maybe this will help you.

385
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,746
Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.

386
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,161
There.

387
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:00,162
That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.

388
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,499
- so he's next, then.
- I think so.

389
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,806
That collapse kills Hunt and Janet.

390
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,311
And that's when you die.

391
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,682
And then Lori.

392
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,186
Then me.

393
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,860
Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed, we can break the chain...

394
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,665
...and the rest of us will be safe.

395
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,934
But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.

396
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,935
- We know nothing about him.
- But we do know where he works.

397
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,808
Grandstate Customs.

398
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,344
Gotta finish up that differential.

399
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,114
Bond that to the fibreglass on it.

400
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,316
- Done with that impact?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

401
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,163
You just want that spot-welded, right?

402
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,803
Hey, can you give me a hand
with this test probe?

403
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,541
Good stuff, man.

404
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,591
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

405
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,592
Who's the fucking moron?

406
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,764
You. What are you doing here?

407
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,266
Trying to find you.

408
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,267
Look, man, I'm sorry for being blunt,
but your life's in danger. You're gonna die.

409
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,404
Three of the people who left that stadium
before that accident...

410
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,775
...they're now dead.

411
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,776
I'm sorry,
but we think that you're gonna be next.

412
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,247
You're serious?

413
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,582
Andy.

414
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,583
You know you can't have these people here.
Take them outside. No visitors in here.

415
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,954
Let's go.

416
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Look, man, I'm trying to put my life
back together, okay?

417
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,479
I mean, watching Nadia die like that
in front of me...

418
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,985
Hey, I know exactly how you feel.

419
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,921
I lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident.

420
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,922
I was driving and I was drunk.

421
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,426
Every day, I ask myself how come
it couldn't be me instead of them.

422
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,168
For a long time,
I carried so much pain and anger...

423
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,671
...it was actually destroying their memory.
So now I try to live each day in their name.

424
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,983
Hey, guys, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm getting a really bad feeling.

425
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,753
Look, kid,
I'm around dangerous equipment every day.

426
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,856
If I was meant to die,
it would've happened by now.

427
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,165
Look out!

428
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,136
- Holy shit.
- You okay, Andy?

429
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,137
Yeah, I'm okay.

430
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,009
Well, I guess it's not my turn to die.

431
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,010
Y'all take care.

432
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,188
Holy--! You all right?

433
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,656
Show us 20 at the body shop.

434
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,958
Honey, I mean,
if you can stop the next death--

435
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,327
I'm seeing clues,
but I can't piece them together.

436
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,629
- You gotta think. Who's next?
- I don't know.

437
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,331
We have to warn your friends.

438
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,233
-How?
-Well, which one is next?

439
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:59,234
-They both die in the collapse. I don't know.
-Nick, think. Focus.

440
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,572
One of them had to be first, even if it
was one second before the other one.

441
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,210
Was it Hunt, or was it Janet?

442
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,349
You gotta find Janet.

443
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,350
I'm gonna find Hunt. Okay?

444
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,542
Oh, God. Faster, go faster.

445
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,212
Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick it up.
Don't be lazy. Faster, faster.

446
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,883
Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving.
Move. Oh!

447
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,419
No, come on. Wake up.
No, we're not done. I'm not done.

448
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,057
Come on.

449
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,627
No, no.

450
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,562
Are you fucking kidding me?

451
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,466
I finished, like, four minutes ago.

452
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,467
-Ever play "Donkey Punch"?
-Dick.

453
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,831
Excuse me, miss,
but could you help a struggling artist?

454
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,604
Sure.

455
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,344
-Thanks.
-Have a nice day.

456
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,347
Let's see what we got here, Browning.

457
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,518
A penny? That's some bullshit.

458
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,525
Oh, damn it.

459
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,366
Great.

460
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,382
Come on, you custom piece of shit.

461
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,057
Come on, pick up the phone. Come on.

462
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,058
Aah. Where are you at? Come on.

463
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,920
This is Hunt. You know what to do.

464
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,921
Hunt, listen to me, buddy, listen.
No water, okay? Stay away from water.

465
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,366
You have three messages marked urgent.

466
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:29,444
That's funny, huh?

467
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,450
-Give me the gun.
-No, ha, ha.

468
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:36,119
Give me the fucking gun.

469
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,120
No.

470
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,802
Fucked up my phone.

471
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,305
Shit.

472
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,711
Perfect.

473
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,558
Hey, Lori, I'm at the car wash.
I'll call you back.

474
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,060
Janet, wait. Wait. Shit.

475
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,363
Do you know if there's a car wash
around here?

476
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,364
-Yeah, there's one on 18th.
-We gotta go there.

477
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,738
Yes. I own you, machine.

478
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,507
Lori?

479
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,443
- What's so important?
- Don't go near water.

480
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,611
What? Water?

481
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,080
- Don't go near water!
- Water? Lori?

482
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,081
Wait. Lori?

483
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,966
Shit.

484
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,648
No service.

485
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:54,649
Shit.

486
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,225
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,499
Come on.

488
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,002
Lord, no.

489
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,437
Close!

490
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,507
Oh, stop it! Oh, my God, no!

491
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,179
Oh, God! Help me!

492
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,293
Please! Somebody, please!

493
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,135
Pick up the phone, Janet.

494
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,871
Oh, God! Help!

495
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:50,872
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

496
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,550
We're almost there.

497
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,124
Oh, shit. Fore!

498
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,622
No, no, no.

499
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,093
- There it is.
- Hurry.

500
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,905
Go around back, George. She's in there.

501
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,810
No!

502
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,925
Go, go, go!

503
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,764
Lori! Lori, get me out of here!

504
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,765
- Shit. I'm coming. Just hold on.
- Come on, get her out.

505
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,935
- Lori, help me!
- I'm trying!

506
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,641
Come here, I got you. I got you.

507
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,599
Hunt.

508
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,143
- So do you have insurance?
- Yeah.

509
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,144
What are we supposed to do now?

510
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,848
I mean, what's gonna happen to us?

511
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,719
You know,
saving Janet either destroyed death's list...

512
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,755
...and all of us are home free,
or it skips her for now and then...

513
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,663
And I'm next.

514
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,932
George, you can't give up.

515
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,933
-No, it's okay.
-What do you mean, "it's okay"?

516
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,837
-I mean, maybe if we all stick together--
-No, I'm at peace with it.

517
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,207
And, um, my family's waiting for me.

518
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,512
I'm ready to go.

519
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,772
When we're done in here, we need to
make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next.

520
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,012
I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.

521
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,516
-Maybe he was in shock.
-No, that's not it.

522
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,287
It was very clear. It's...
It's like he just accepted it.

523
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,925
I think he's given up.

524
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,464
If he dies, I'm next.

525
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,465
And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.

526
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,534
Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.

527
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,774
I don't want anything to happen to you.

528
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,775
And if we're together, it makes it easier
for death to take both of us.

529
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,479
I don't care what happens.
We are in this together.

530
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:42,123
Look.

531
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,296
Maybe no one else has to die.

532
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,233
We should go tell George.

533
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:55,403
Hello?

534
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,841
George.

535
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,879
We think saving Janet broke the chain.

536
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,920
George?

537
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:34,108
-George?
-George?

538
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,582
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. George--

539
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,419
Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
After everything that we've been through.

540
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:48,424
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

541
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,727
Trying to give God
what I thought he wanted.

542
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,728
I've been trying to kill myself all day.

543
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,266
Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.

544
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,267
Then I went to the garage,
hooked a hose from the tailpipe...

545
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,438
...stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.

546
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Then...

547
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,814
So wait.

548
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,815
Saving Janet
must have destroyed the list, then.

549
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,258
I think congratulations are in order.

550
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,826
To breaking the chain.

551
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,827
- Apple cider?
- Thank you.

552
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,165
-Thank God.
-And a toast.

553
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,433
Mm-hm.

554
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,901
-To life.
-To life.

555
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,902
- To life.
- Yes.

556
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,340
Mm...

557
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:40,341
We've been given a second chance.
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?

558
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,513
- I have a few plans for us, ha, ha.
- Uh, oh-oh.

559
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:46,514
Lots of travelling, like Paris,
maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez.

560
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,685
I'm just thankful we have our whole lives
ahead of us, you know?

561
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,156
Yeah.

562
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,157
Now this is over,
I'm not gonna take another day for granted.

563
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,962
Ever.

564
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,963
You know, maybe it's time to stop talking
about doing stuff and actually start doing it.

565
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:07,201
-You only live once, right?
-That's what I'm talking about.

566
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:10,706
Let me get the cookies.

567
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,180
We made it.

568
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,181
We did.

569
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,634
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

570
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,237
- Did you get the traveller's checks?
- Yes, I did.

571
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,039
Need anything from the mall?

572
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,907
No, I think we're good.

573
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,076
You sure you don't wanna come
to the movie?

574
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,645
-It's in 3-D.
-Love Lays Dying?

575
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,515
Yeah, I think I'll be all right.
Sounds like a chickflick.

576
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,484
But, uh, I'll have everything packed
by the time you get home.

577
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,087
Amsterdam, here we come.

578
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,088
I can't believe we're actually going.
Um, heh--

579
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,191
You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.

580
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:07,063
speaking of, she's walking up right now.
I'm gonna run, okay?

581
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,698
- Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

582
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,433
-Love you.
-Love you too. Be home soon.

583
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,934
- Bye.
- Bye.

584
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,935
-Hi.
-Hi, ha, ha.

585
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,571
John Doe, the unknown survivor
of the speedway crash...

586
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,607
...has finally been named
now that his family's been notified.

587
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,977
Jonathan Groves was rescued
in the rubble.

588
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,386
George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?

589
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,154
Look, man, we got the order wrong.

590
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,590
Remember that guy who sat in front of me?
The cowboy?

591
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,591
He didn't die, which means he's next.
Look, just be there in five. I'm on my way.

592
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,174
You feeling okay, Mr. Suby?

593
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,677
Ha. Why do you care?

594
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,678
You know how many of your kind
I killed in Korea?

595
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,016
-I'm Chinese, sir.
-Ha, same difference.

596
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,185
I need you in PT 3 right now.

597
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,853
- Okay.
- And I do mean now.

598
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,522
- Okay.
- Thank you.

599
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,024
Be back in a few minutes
to get you into that tub.

600
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,163
Dr. Helfrich to Obstetrics.

601
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:50,164
Hey. Somebody. Hey. Help.

602
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,367
Forgot to turn the water off.

603
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,537
Help.

604
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,142
Help. Somebody help.

605
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:05,147
- Dr. Finn, extension 2861.
- Somebody help.

606
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,683
Dr. Finn, extension 2861.

607
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,912
George. George.

608
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,250
Where's Lori?

609
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,251
I've been calling and texting all afternoon.
She's not picking up.

610
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:47,488
Maybe it won't matter. Come on.

611
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,107
How can there be someone else on the list?
He didn't leave the racetrack with us.

612
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,211
If I would've asked him to move
like in the premonition, he would've died.

613
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,283
He survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.

614
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,253
You weren't next, he was.
It wasn't destined at all.

615
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:20,254
So if he dies, I'm next again.

616
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,360
Great, man.

617
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,862
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Taylor to Pathology.

618
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,863
Dr. Sheila Taylor to Pathology.

619
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:54,221
Yeah.

620
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,416
-Those are really hot.
-Yes. I love these. I like how they--

621
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,489
-Oh!
-Aah! What the hell?

622
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:32,695
Ow!

623
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,696
Ugh, hey. Stop--

624
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,041
That's genius. Someone could get killed.

625
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,017
-Man, I'm feeling something.
-Don't lose hope, man.

626
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,018
If we keep an eye out for signs of danger,
I think we got a shot.

627
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:01,188
-Let's just go find Lori and Janet.
-No, no, not that. I mean, it's like dej vu.

628
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,827
My wife said that dej vu
is like God's way of--

629
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,830
- Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go.
- Okay.

630
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,347
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Okay, thanks.

631
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,050
Hi. Do you have these in a six?

632
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,519
Yes, we bring them in fresh every day.

633
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,555
- Hello.
- Oh!

634
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:34,190
-Cool, let's go.
-What do you think?

635
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,524
Ah...

636
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,525
Well, they're cute yet functional.

637
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,996
I like them.

638
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,899
They say, "I'm getting older,
but I still like to party." Ha, ha.

639
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,735
Ha, ha, I didn't buy them for you,
I bought them for Nick.

640
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,736
He likes me in sneaks.

641
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,246
Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.

642
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:58,747
Right off the corner brace?

643
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,549
Check the measurement. It's not fitting.

644
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,550
Those windows won't pass.

645
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,460
Yeah, 90 on that.

646
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,129
Yeah, that looks fine.

647
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,798
Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.

648
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,568
Yeah, around the corner.

649
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,470
- Lunch, boys.
- Okay.

650
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,471
Back in an hour.

651
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,115
Is that yoghurt place still open?

652
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:36,116
- Yeah, I think they're still here.
- Wait. My shoelace is caught.

653
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,587
- What?
- My shoelace is stuck.

654
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,823
- Oh, okay, here.
- Just help me get it out.

655
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:43,824
- Look, I'm gonna grab your--
- It's not coming out, though, Janet.

656
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:45,728
-Don't freak out.
-Pull my leg harder.

657
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,230
Help me try to get it out.
It's not coming loose.

658
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,231
- I am trying. I'm pulling.
- It's twisting my ankle. Ow! Ow!

659
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,573
Fuck.

660
01:02:57,574 --> 01:03:00,175
I should've seen that one coming.

661
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,176
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

662
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,660
Here's two for Love Lays Dying.
Enjoy the show.

663
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,661
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

664
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,765
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello.

665
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,766
-Theatre 13, second door on your left.
-Thanks.

666
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,370
- So, what do you want?
- I don't know.

667
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,166
Where the hell you going?

668
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,780
Go. Go now. Cut him off.

669
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,021
- Are you fucking nuts?
- It's just up ahead.

670
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:58,592
Hold on, pumpkin. We'll be there in no time.

671
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,029
That's really cool.

672
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,469
- Down in front, asshole.
- That's so ridiculous.

673
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:16,912
sir, move your feet.

674
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,913
Put these in your ears. It's gonna get loud.

675
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,651
What do you mean?

676
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,486
Look, don't get mad at me...

677
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,487
...but do you remember
when Nick said that he could see signs...

678
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,892
...before something bad
was gonna happen?

679
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,628
Well, now I think I'm seeing them.

680
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:36,997
Lori, it's over. Nothing is gonna happen.

681
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
- Now can we please watch the movie?
- I'm going.

682
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,168
Are you kidding me?

683
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,613
- Everybody off
- We'll never make it.

684
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,283
It's gonna blow.

685
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,284
Lori. Lori.

686
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,689
- Lori!
- Shut up, man.

687
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:36,690
Bye-bye, suckers.

688
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,541
"Dixieland."

689
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,176
-Something's wrong.
-No kidding.

690
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,177
-The person next to me won't shut up.
-No, I'm serious. Something's wrong.

691
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,847
Things are happening
just like at the track.

692
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:17,230
-Lori, you in here?
-Nick.

693
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,768
-It's not over.
-What?

694
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,769
George is dead.

695
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,741
Janet, come on.
We have to leave right now.

696
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,742
No. No, I can't keep doing this, okay?
You're both nuts.

697
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:31,912
-Janet, we gotta go. Come on.
-No. Don't you see?

698
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,582
This is where I was supposed to be
in the first place, not that race.

699
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,052
-Come on. Come on.
-I was meant to see this movie.

700
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,789
Bye-bye, suckers.

701
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,072
Janet!

702
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,742
Lori, come on!

703
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,748
Find the way to the exit. Remain calm.
Everything's gonna be okay.

704
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,492
Let's go! Let's go!

705
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,580
- I got you.
- Pull me up! Pull me up!

706
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,983
Nick! Nick!

707
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:43,785
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on! Hold on!

708
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,155
-Climb up my arm!
-Don't let me go!

709
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,524
Climb up my arm!

710
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,525
No! Hold on, I got you. I got you.

711
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,172
No, no, no!

712
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,711
Lori, no! Lori, no!

713
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:19,388
I mean, it's dej vu.

714
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,890
-My wife said that dej vu is God's way--
-Look out!

715
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,895
- Hurry.
- Get some help!

716
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,497
- Help.
- Over here!

717
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,498
Lori.

718
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:39,141
Hey, watch it.

719
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:42,142
Down in front, asshole.

720
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,716
Hey, come on, man.

721
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,918
- Watch out.
- Hey.

722
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,919
Hey, come on.

723
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:08,101
Janet, something's wrong.

724
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,970
Come on, come on, come on.

725
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,971
Uh, damn it.

726
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,087
Fuck! Oh!

727
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,426
We were wrong about the order.
What if we're wrong about the chain?

728
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,297
Then we wouldn't be here at all.

729
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,633
And yet here I am,
trying to watch a movie...

730
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,536
...despite my best friend going crazy
next to me.

731
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,343
Oh, fuck.

732
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:01,181
Oh, shit. Shit.

733
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,529
It's gonna blow. Move it!

734
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,207
Come on. Come on.

735
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,208
Bye-bye, suckers.

736
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:21,196
I guess this is
how I'm gonna be remembered.

737
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,132
Thanks.

738
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,720
Try to tie it off right there.

739
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,156
That's good.

740
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,925
Just this side of the Union City.

741
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,926
Hey, man, excuse me.
Is this thing supposed to be this way?

742
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,996
- Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter?
- You're right.

743
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,668
Tell you what,
we'll get somebody on that.

744
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,669
-Pays to be safe, man. Trust me.
-Yeah.

745
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,506
That's one down.

746
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,511
You wanna meet up with them now?

747
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,692
-Small mint tea.
-Thanks.

748
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:26,294
- Small latte for you.
- Thank you.

749
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,295
And for me...

750
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:31,666
Um, what the hell is that?

751
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,667
A giant chococcino with whipped cream,
chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.

752
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,105
That looks disgusting.

753
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,874
Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma
just looking at it.

754
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,875
Well, what can I say, ladies?
It looked good.

755
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:48,216
Yeah, but it tastes totally disgusting.

756
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:55,021
Say, you're the guy
who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?

757
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,325
You saved a lot of lives, man.

758
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,163
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

759
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,164
Mm-hm. Sometimes that's all it takes.

760
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,674
Okay, that was really weird.

761
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,410
- Hey, don't knock my fan base.
- Heh, God.

762
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:17,078
I love your bag, by the way.

763
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,079
-Oh, thanks. I actually just got it.
-Did you? Where?

764
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,051
Yeah. There's a place
right next to Brevig's. It just opened.

765
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,520
- Brevig's?
- Yeah, it's in that shopping center.

766
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,521
There's a grocery store and a card shop'
and then there's a--

767
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:31,326
- It's like a little accessories store.
- Oh, yeah.

768
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,327
It's super cute. If you want one
of these purses, they have it in plaid.

769
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,766
- Ha, ha, is that the only other one?
- Yeah.

770
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,767
They only made two?

771
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:56,783
What do you think, babe?

772
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,620
Hey, uh, space cadet,
you wanna come back down to Earth?

773
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,062
What if we didn't change anything?

774
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,731
-What are you talking about?
-Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

775
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,732
What if us being here right now...

776
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,937
...was the plan from the beginning?
