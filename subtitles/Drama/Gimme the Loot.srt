1
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:32,670
Shit.

2
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:34,779
Hey!

3
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:35,770
- Oh, shit!
- Hey!

4
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:36,796
Yo, Champ, get out of here!

5
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,852
Pull out!
Pull out, Champion!

6
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,038
Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,516
# Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

8
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:46,558
# Get ready, everybody

9
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:47,841
# Let's shimmy

10
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:53,819
# All the shimmying
that we do #

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,064
Right now, it's time for our
latest tales from the street,

12
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:57,791
and I'm here with my man
the legendary Speedy.

13
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:59,073
What's going on, Base?
How you doing?

14
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:00,090
I'm good.
How are you?

15
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,277
- Chillin', chillin'.
- All right, cool.

16
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:02,462
So what's this crazy-ass shit

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,809
that happened out in Queens
last week?

18
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:05,251
Yeah, so me and my boy Rox,

19
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:07,193
we go out to Shea Stadium
to catch a Mets game, you know,

20
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:09,124
but for us, it ain't even about
watching the Mets.

21
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,334
We bring in these cans

22
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:11,583
'cause we trying
to bomb the apple.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,864
Why are you trying
to bomb the apple?

24
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,460
Explain what the apple is
for everybody.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,867
Well, anybody who's living
up in this fine city knows

26
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:18,787
anytime someone on the Mets
hits a home run,

27
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,859
this goofy-ass apple
pops out of the-

28
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,071
pops out of the stands,
and everybody goes crazy.

29
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,962
It's corny,
but I'm a fucking Mets fan.

30
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:26,817
- No, fuck the Mets.
- Don't disrespect the Mets.

31
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,029
All right, all right,
it's your show,

32
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,528
so I'ma let that slide.

33
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:31,710
But seriously, yo, you know,
I mean, we've hit walls.

34
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,153
We've hit subways before.

35
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:35,326
But if you hit the apple
when it pops up,

36
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,443
the whole crowd sees it.

37
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,043
Everybody watching on TV
sees it.

38
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,359
All of New York
will see that shit.

39
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,824
That's gonna be, like, forever.

40
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,590
We had to wait until about,
like, 4:00 in the morning.

41
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:43,739
We go over there
to center field,

42
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:45,022
we hop the fence,
and there it is-

43
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:46,302
boom, the apple.

44
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,386
You know,
I'm right underneath it.

45
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,670
I can see it.
I can touch it.

46
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,648
We're ready to go,
and then, man,

47
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:52,251
flashlights are all over us.

48
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,145
There was mad cops,
so we just bounced, right?

49
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,065
I'm running one way.
Rox is running the other way.

50
00:01:56,098 --> 00:01:57,341
I think I'm in the clear,

51
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:58,971
but, like, I had to-
I caught a charge.

52
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,471
You gonna try to bomb
that apple again?

53
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,456
Hell yeah, I'm gonna try
and bomb that apple again!

54
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:03,742
Yo, I'm a constant opportunist,

55
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:05,664
so if the situation arises,
then hell yeah.

56
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:08,730
But honestly, even if it's not
Speedy or Rox that do it,

57
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,493
somebody's gonna bomb
that apple,

58
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,122
and they gonna get mad props
in the game.

59
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,918
Their names are gonna ring out
in our world.

60
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,457
# Ah, the shimmy
is what's happening

61
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,245
# To everybody

62
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,295
# Shimmy

63
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,970
# Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy,
shimmy #

64
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:08,252
A'ight, yo, let's go.

65
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:45,749
Buffing our shit?

66
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,032
Who the fuck
they think they are?

67
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,378
Yo, that's what I'm saying, man.

68
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,005
I gotta get me
one of those Queens boys, man.

69
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:52,150
You gonna get you one of them
Queens toys and do what?

70
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,334
I'ma fuck-yo.

71
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,485
I take care of my shit.
You don't know.

72
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,802
Gus, let me get two slices.

73
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,047
You know, I don't know.

74
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,907
What, you a gangster?
What, you a thug now?

75
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,282
When I need to be.

76
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,356
Yo, don't let me catch
one of these motherfuckers

77
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:03,803
buffing our pieces.

78
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,723
I'ma come up behind 'em
with some GoodFellas shit.

79
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:06,803
They not gonna see it comin'.

80
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,470
Put, like, two
in the back of they head.

81
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,752
Easy, just-

82
00:04:09,788 --> 00:04:11,097
First of all,
nobody in they right mind

83
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:12,179
is gonna give you a gun.

84
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,365
It's not funny.

85
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,811
And second of all,
if you gonna shoot somebody,

86
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,250
you shoot them in the eye
like a fuckin' man.

87
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:18,139
Be the last thing they see
before they drop,

88
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,593
not like them fuckin'
"GodFellas" pussies.

89
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,538
Yo, whatever, as long as they
get got, yo, I'm fuckin'-

90
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,302
Stupid-ass Mets fans, yo.

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,379
I'm tired of them and that
fucking buffing our shit

92
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,142
with that dumb-ass Mets logo.

93
00:04:29,179 --> 00:04:30,456
And I'm really sick

94
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,615
of that fucking corny
blue and orange on everything.

95
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,203
That shit... that shit is...

96
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,868
We gotta do something.
We have to.

97
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,467
All right,
listen, listen, listen.

98
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,651
So this is what we gon' do.

99
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,065
Don't your brother
train some boxer

100
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,560
that work at Shea Stadium?

101
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,260
You mean Citi Field,
where the Mets play at?

102
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,378
Citi Field?

103
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,728
I'm not calling it
after some stupid bank.

104
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:49,842
It's called Shea Stadium.

105
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,311
And do you know
the nigga or not?

106
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:52,915
- Who?
- "Who?"

107
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:55,125
Fucking Pedro or some shit?

108
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,852
Yeah, yeah, Pedro,
he works, like, at Shea, like,

109
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,962
off-game security when the Mets
is out of town and shit.

110
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,343
But who the fuck cares?
Fuck Pedro.

111
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:01,752
- And fuck the Mets too.
- Fuck the Mets.

112
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,127
That's exactly
what the fuck I'm saying.

113
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:04,536
So look,
this is what you gon' do.

114
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:05,813
You gonna call Pedro.

115
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,060
He gonna sneak us in.

116
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:08,985
We gonna bomb
that stupid-ass apple.

117
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,294
Then when they get a home run,

118
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,718
everybody gonna see our names
on that shit, right?

119
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,038
And who gonna be on our dick?

120
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:15,120
Them Queens niggas.

121
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:16,339
Yo, you fucking crazy!

122
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:17,783
No, I'm fucking serious.

123
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,224
Yo, that's brilliant.
That's brilliant.

124
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,751
Yo, we gonna be so famous
off this shit.

125
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,003
We gonna be legends.

126
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,048
They gonna make a fucking statue
of me in Central Park,

127
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,161
holding a spray can,
holding my sac like this.

128
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,793
You're retarded.

129
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:32,024
And I'ma get so much ass
off of this, Sofia.

130
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,161
I'ma get so much pussy, like...

131
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,884
If I never got pussy before,
now is the time.

132
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,327
Like you said,
never got it before,

133
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,407
and you never gon' get it.

134
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,463
What?

135
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:46,478
All right, Pedro,
we gonna get it done.

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,829
We gonna get it done.

137
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:49,805
We'll meet you at the stadium
Friday morning.

138
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:51,124
All right.

139
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,144
Yo, good looking, Sal.

140
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,710
Okay, take care, huh?

141
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:58,962
You too.

142
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,553
Yo, what happened?

143
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,735
You already know
I got it done.

144
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:12,149
Come on.

145
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,668
We just gotta do it before, like-

146

00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:18,000
'cause they come back.

148
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:19,532
A'ight, that's, like, what,

149
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:20,916
- That's no problem.
- Word.

150
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,957
Why don't we just do
that shit now?

151
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,038
Oh, 'cause he-
no, he not around today.

152
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:26,420
We can't do it today.

153
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,079
But, um, yeah,
everything's good.

154
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,525
He was like, just-
you know what I'm saying?

155
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:31,412
Just show up, you know,

156
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,355
and we gotta give him $500.

157
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:36,756
$500?

158
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:38,164
Yeah.

159
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,237
Where the fuck
are we supposed to get $500?

160
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,033
I... I thought we would
bless this nigga, like,

161
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,589
with some weed or something,
but fuckin' $500?

162
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,971
Look, you don't understand, man.

163
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,314
This nigga owes so much money.

164
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,778
He fuckin' heard about
a fix on a fight

165
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:50,763
at the Blue Horizon in Philly,
and guess what.

166
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,786
I don't give a fuck.

167
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,552
This nigga bet the wrong guy.

168
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:55,312
How you bet-how you gonna bet
the wrong guy?

169
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,691
What kind of stupid shit is that?

170
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:58,447
How we gonna get this paper?

171
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,272
Well, for starters,
Ronaldo owes me $80

172
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:02,991
for that custom,
and I got deliveries.

173
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,687
Well, you gonna have to steal
them deliveries.

174
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,513
I'm not stealin' from Donnie.
That nigga'll kill me.

175
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:07,661
You not stealing from Donnie?

176
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,944
What, you scared
of Donnie's rich ass?

177
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,409
Don't be a fucking pussy.

178
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,132
- Man,
it ain't even about that.

179
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:16,172
Yo, so-yo, my fuckin' mom's
getting on my nerves, man.

180
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,383
Shit.

181
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,663
Look, my bad.

182
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,682
I'm just saying, like,

183
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:22,250
she ain't trying
to give us no loan.

184
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,404
That's all I'm saying.

185
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,588
I feel you.

186
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,837
But I know one thing.

187
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,500
You can sell-
you can sell

188
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:30,222
the rest of those cans
to fuckin'- to the Kaps.

189
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:31,688
I know you want to do that.

190
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,192
Yeah, I could do that.

191
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,795
Yeah, I bet.

192
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:36,111
Don't worry about my shit.

193
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,292
Why don't you focus
on your shit

194
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,575
and gettin' your shit
straight?

195
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,690
- Listen, I'm focused on my shit
all day.

196
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,974
- Oh, you focused on your shit
all day?

197
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:42,571
So why you going
the wrong fucking way?

198
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,301
You supposed to be going
to the train station.

199
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,647
- Oh, shit, you right.
Fuck.

200
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,089
I'll see you later, yo.

201
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,953
# Lord, send it on down

202
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,197
# Straight on down

203
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,917
# O Lord,
let the Holy Ghost

204
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,328
# Come on down

205
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,882
# Whoa, send it on down here,
Lord

206
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,448
# Straight on down

207
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,450
# O Lord, let the Holy Ghost
come on down #

208
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,016
Yo, Lenny, what's up?

209
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,966
Malcolm, wow.

210
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,155
It's good to see you, man.

211
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,240
Word, you too.

212
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,710
They got you workin' short pack
today?

213
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,182
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,239
They downstairs?

215
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,709
Yeah, yeah, you could go.

216
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:21,734
All right, watch your head.

217
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:22,954
All right.

218
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:24,400
Appreciate it.

219
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:25,926
- Motherfucker
from down the block, man,

220
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,910
and he talkin' about going-
garbage cans and shit.

221
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:29,741
Yo, what's good?

222
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,053
Look at this motherfuck.

223
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:32,463
Where the fuck you been?

224
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:35,496
- Yo, I've been bombing
like crazy, yo.

225
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:38,122
Did you see that shit I did
on the-um, on the Brooklyn?

226
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,589
Nah.

227
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,771
- Yo, a'ight, just load me up
on some deliveries, then.

228
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:44,142
I'll sell all that shit today.

229
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,550
Nah, man, we good.

230
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,696
Come on, Donnie.

231
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,913
Fuck you, man.

232
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,228
Go pick up cans or some shit.

233
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:51,086
Listen, you come in Monday.

234
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,508
You work a whole fuckin' day.

235
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:54,761
Then maybe we'll talk.

236
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,963
- Man, look.
Um...

237
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,722
Yo, I need to borrow some money.
I need, like, $500.

238
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,839
But, look,
it's an emergency situation.

239
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,827
Get the fuck out of here.

240
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:02,819
- Don't worry.
I'll work it off.

241
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:04,357
- I ain't seen you
in fuckin' three weeks.

242
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:06,122
You come in and ask for $500,
man?

243
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,427
Yo, look.

244
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,502
Yo, this is-
- Fuck you.

245
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:11,491
Come on, man.

246
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:12,614
This is fucking
life or death, man.

247
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:15,688
Well, you're gonna be dead.

248
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:19,239
- You're gonna be dead,
so dress warm.

249
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:23,427
Yo, you a Yankee fan?

250
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,517
What about you?

251
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,768
Get the fuck out of here.

252
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:32,555
- You heard him.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

253
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,833
You're fired.

254
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:35,080
- Fired?
- Fired.

255
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,327
- Get the fuck out of here,
man.

256
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,773
That's why Ike Davis
sucks mad dick.

257
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:38,950
Nigga, fuck both of y'all.

258
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,037
Oh!

259
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:41,932
Jeter swallows, motherfucker.

260
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:43,754
Clown.

261
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,138
# Either that
or a 50-cent ho #

262
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:49,188
You set, Malcolm?

263
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:52,519
Actually...

264
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:54,083
They baggin' downstairs,

265
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:56,775
so they said give me, like,
ten of yours.

266
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,241
Well, I don't have ten.

267
00:09:58,285 --> 00:09:59,691
I got five.
You want 'em?

268
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,131
- That'll work.
That's good. That's good.

269
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:02,725
- I mean,
I just have one delivery, so...

270
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:04,008
All right, word.

271
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:05,321
All right, here, turn around.

272
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,024
All I see on these streets,
Malcolm,

273
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,660
is guys wearing flip-flops.

274
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,226
It's fucking disgusting,
really.

275
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,544
It's not a joke.

276
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,547
I mean, what the fuck
is this city coming to?

277
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:17,832
Back in the '90s,

278
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,355
you would have never seen a guy
wearing flip-flops.

279
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:23,657
I mean, if a woman wants to show
her pretty toes, fine.

280
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:25,895
I don't recommend it, but...

281
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,801
You want to go to the beach
in flip-flops, all right.

282
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,752
It's a pass there, but...

283
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:32,933
What's the address?

284
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,858
- Yo, it's this girl-
Ginnie.

285
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,207
She's Donnie's sister's friend
from high school.

286
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:40,039
I don't know.
Private school girl.

287
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,089
Where does she live?

288
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,113
She's all right.

289
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:43,136
Yo, Malcolm,

290
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:44,640
could you just chill
for a second?

291
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:46,373
You know,
I'm really bored out here.

292
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,614
It's fucking hot as shit,
and I just-

293
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,079
just want to talk
for a second.

294
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:51,813
- Yo, it's not even like-
it's not even like that.

295
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,738
Look, Donnie just chewed my ass
about how slow I am,

296
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,494
and I'm just trying
to speed this shit up.

297
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,123
Yo, fuck Donnie.

298
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,550
Chill and talk to your boy Lenny
for a second.

299
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,055
Yo, I gotta jet, man.

300
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:02,789
Like, come on.
I just need the address.

301
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:04,287
All right.

302
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,184
It's 34 East 1 Oth Street,
okay?

303
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,843
A'ight, what apartment?

304
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:09,157
- Six.
- A'ight.

305
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,141
I miss you, man.

306
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,167
Thank you.

307
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,802
- Be good.
- Peace, Lenny.

308
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:27,495
- What's up?
- Hi.

309
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:28,640
Hot out there, huh?

310
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:29,858
Huh?

311
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,806
- It's hot outside.
- Yeah, it really is.

312
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,239
Um, is Ronaldo upstairs?

313
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,963
Yeah, I guess.

314
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,921
Ronaldo.

315
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,519
# Ronaldo #

316
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,331
Sofia?

317
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,090
Yeah.

318
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:03,014
Oh, come on, nigga.
You still asleep?

319
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,737
No, I'm depressed.

320
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:05,756
Why are you depressed?

321
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,871
They discontinue Fruity Pebbles?

322
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,503
She dumped me.

323
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:11,430
- Now, you know that girl
was just fucking with you.

324
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,023
You know
that shit wasn't serious.

325
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,785
- I can't stop thinking
about her.

326
00:12:14,822 --> 00:12:16,251
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

327
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:17,538
- You gonna give us
that 100 bucks

328
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,549
for that "Ronaldo loves Alyssa"
custom we made you.

329
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,572
That's what you gonna do.

330
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,240
It's "A-Lisa. "

331
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:23,685
Whatever.

332
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,660
- No, get it right.
And it's 80 bucks.

333
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,938
So then give me my 80 bucks.

334
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,258
I love her.

335
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,774
You love her?

336
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,952
You out your mind, son.

337
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,094
- Yo, I never gave her
this shirt.

338
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,180
You could take it.

339
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,847
- Uh-uh.
What do I want with this?

340
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,314
- I don't know.
Resell it or something.

341
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:45,437
Resell it?

342
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:46,590
Nah, it don't work like that.

343
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:47,709
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,156
Find some other herb
named Ronaldo

345
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,171
who's fucking your girl?

346
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:51,522
I don't think so.

347
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:54,109
Hey, look, I can't pay you.

348
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,572
Look, you can keep the custom.

349
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:07,034
Give it to Alyssa
to try to win her back.

350
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:09,497
It's "A-Lisa. "

351
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,638
- You need to get over this shit
and go find some other girl.

352
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,104
I can't, though.

353
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:17,115
I got no money, I got no job,
and I got no girl.

354
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:18,749
I got nothing!

355
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,692
What about your kicks?

356
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,836
- Yeah, I got my sneakers.
Big whoop.

357
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,331
- Nah, I'm saying,
run your sneakers.

358
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,745
What?

359
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,055
- Look, nigga,
you owe us money,

360
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,105
and we need the cash now,

361
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,186
so I'm taking your sneakers.

362
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:34,299
But those are my favorites.

363
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:38,174
So?

364
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,833
Yo, what the fuck!

365
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:45,663
Bitch, why the fuck
didn't you stop them?

366
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:47,259
I don't care.

367
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:01,945
Call your fucking friend.

368
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:02,912
I don't have a phone.

369
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:03,927
Call your fucking friend.

370
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:04,918
I don't have a phone.

371
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:06,073
You don't have a phone?

372
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,739
What the fuck is this
in your pocket, then?

373
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,665
Oh, you don't have
a fucking phone?

374
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,585
So what the fuck is this, then?

375
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,079
- He doesn't have a phone,
though.

376
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,615
- Oh, he don't have
a fucking phone.

377
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:16,119
Okay, and since you didn't have
a phone,

378
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,721
I guess I'm not robbing
your ass, then.

379
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,354
- I'm sorry.
- What the fu-

380
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:26,496
Fuck!

381
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:40,102
# I believe

382
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,617
# I believe

383
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:51,355
# I'll go home #

384
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,069
Hello?

385
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:00,663
Take off your shoes.

386
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,775
I'm in the bathroom.

387
00:15:11,231 --> 00:15:12,474
Hey.

388
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,037
You're not Donnie.

389
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:15,605
Who are you?

390
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,020
Uh...

391
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,258
Sliced my toe really badly.

392
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,755
Does it hurt?

393
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:23,001
Yeah, like hell.

394
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,347
I'm sorry.

395
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,454
- It's okay.
It's not your fault.

396
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:30,173
Come in.

397
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,624
So who are you?

398
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:34,839
I'm Malcolm.

399
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:36,568
Oh, okay.

400
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,362
- You just asked me who I am.
That's my name.

401
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,339
- Come in. Come in.
Into the bedroom.

402
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,897
Where's Donnie?

403
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,072
Come sit over here.

404
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:50,200
- I don't know.
He must be working.

405
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,993
Look at my toe.

406
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:54,547
It's really bad.

407
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,793
Yeah, it is.

408
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,803
You should put some Vaseline
on that or something.

409
00:15:58,844 --> 00:16:00,851
My brother's a boxer,
and they always use that for-

410
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:02,518
- Vaseline?
- Yeah.

411
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:05,556
- No, it needs, like,
hydrogen peroxide or something.

412
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:08,116
Whatever works for you.

413
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:12,050
- You know, you don't exactly
seem like the Donnie type.

414
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,652
I mean, I work for him.

415
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:16,059
And we go bombing together
sometimes, but that's about it.

416
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,498
Like terrorists?

417
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:18,514
What?

418
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:19,667
Bombing?

419
00:16:19,707 --> 00:16:21,779
Nah, yo, like graffiti.

420
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,543
You know, spray paint,

421
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,140
writing on walls,
climbing buildings.

422
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,066
- I know what graffiti is,
okay?

423
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,528
I'm not an idiot.

424
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,131
Um, look, I need a 50.

425
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,058
My wallet's in the other room.

426
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:03,471
Oh, I'm so broke.

427
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,975
- Yeah, I see you got, like,
a lot of cameras in here.

428
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,383
My uncle, he bought me a camera
just like that before.

429
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,627
Uh-huh.

430
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,552
I broke that shit, though.

431
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,322
It was a nice one too.

432
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,596
Got a nice big flash
on the top.

433
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:34,902
Hey, do you have $10?

434
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,528
I don't, actually.

435
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,444
I'll tell you what.

436
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,560
I'll give you $60

437
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,152
if you smoke me up
out of your stash.

438
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,579
- I-
- Here you go.

439
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,135
I'm gonna go get my bowl
from my mom's room.

440
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,542
- Why is your bowl
in your mom's room?

441
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,036
Oh, she doesn't care.

442
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,380
And she's in Nantucket
for the weekend anyway.

443
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:56,942
What the fuck is Nantucket?

444
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,154
Holy shit.

445
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:07,887
Let's smoke this.

446
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:09,618
- Word, come on.
Let's do it.

447
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:20,401
So, uh, where's Donnie?

448
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:23,569
Is he golfing
with that asshole Ben Brogan?

449
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,732
Donnie does not golf.

450
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:29,522
Yes, he does.

451
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,150
You didn't know that?

452
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:34,224
No, 'cause it's not true.

453
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,904
I don't know what to tell you
other than the fact

454
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,875
that he was on the varsity
golf team at Oornell.

455
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:41,997
Get the fuck out of here.

456
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,443
I'm not kidding.

457
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:45,517
- Yo, my boys found out
about this shit?

458
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,539
You don't understand.

459
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,304
This nigga Zerox golfs?

460
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:49,650
That's fucking retarded.

461
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:50,928
Zerox?

462
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,372
Yeah, that's his tag name.

463
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,957
That's ridiculous.

464
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,530
- Yo.
- Yo, Malcolm.

465
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,481
Where Champion's spot at
again?

466
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:06,768
You mean the impound?

467
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:09,007
Yeah.

468
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,538
- Wait, you going to sell
the cans?

469
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,848
- No, we gonna talk about
our feelings.

470
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:16,844
- A'ight, it's on 134th,
right by the underpass.

471
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:17,996
A'ight.

472
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:39,050
- So have you ever traveled
anywhere?

473
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,813
I've been to Florida.

474
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,410
- That's not bad.
It must be nice.

475
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,076
I've never been to Florida.

476
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:46,187
Where have you been?

477
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,113
I've been to India.

478
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,390
What?

479
00:19:49,426 --> 00:19:51,565
- Yeah, Oosta Rica,
Mexico,

480
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:53,031
Paris, all over Italy-

481
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,113
like, three times in Italy-

482
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,470
Spain,
elsewhere in France.

483
00:19:58,514 --> 00:19:59,943
That's crazy.

484
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:02,320
- There's still so many places
I want to go, though.

485
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,433
I mean-

486
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:06,441
- But, shit,
you got a head start on me.

487
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,783
- Yeah, well,
I'm sure you'd like it.

488
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:12,623
What are your favorite foods?

489
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:14,729
- That's easy.
Milkshakes.

490
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:16,263
What flavor?

491
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,247
Vanilla milkshakes.

492
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,841
Nah, fuck vanilla.
That's wack.

493
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,309
No, vanilla's fine.

494
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,491
I don't like chocolate and get
shit for that all the time.

495
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:25,837
- I'm more interesting
than that.

496
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:27,333
I like...

497
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:29,645
Mint chocolate.

498
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,655
Yeah.

499
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,125
Okay.

500
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:35,786
What's your favorite food?

501
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,474
- Uh, that's easy,
two favorite foods:

502
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:40,137
oysters, cherry pie.

503
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,085
Oh, three: champagne.

504
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:43,883
- That's-
champagne is not a food.

505
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,261
All in combination.

506
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:46,539
The best meal.

507
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:47,851
You a drunk.

508
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,872
Yo, Champion, what's good?

509
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,925
What up, girl?

510
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,112
What's poppin'?

511
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,939
- Damn, still doing
that nursing home scam,

512
00:21:08,974 --> 00:21:09,989
robbin' them old ladies?

513
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,274
That's fucked up.

514
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,732
- You gonna question me
on how I feed my family, man?

515
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,846
This is how I feed my kids.

516
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:18,733
If I gotta scam the old folk,
I'ma scam the old folk.

517
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,780
Right, right.

518
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,545
Yo, I need my cans.

519
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:22,727
You need all the fucking cans?

520
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,194
All my fucking cans.

521
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,579
- What the fuck
you about to get into?

522
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:26,726
Don't worry about it.

523
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:27,845
What you scheming on, man?

524
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,096
- It ain't got shit to do
with you,

525
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,082
so don't worry about it.

526
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,434
Just go get my cans.

527
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,836
- You gonna watch how you
fucking talk to me too, man,

528
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,454
before I make you go back
outside and come back in,

529
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,631
start this shit
all over again.

530
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,195
- Will you please
go get my cans?

531
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:42,124
A'ight, that's better, man.

532
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:44,360
One minute, mama.

533
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:46,666
Fuck up my work habitat.

534
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,555
Yo, you got all 25?

535
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:50,628
- Yeah, bitch,
I got all 25 fucking cans!

536
00:21:50,668 --> 00:21:52,261
And you got my five montanas?

537
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,690
- Yo, listen, I ain't touched
your fucking bag, man.

538
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:55,976
Take yo' shit, man.

539
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,506
Let me see.

540
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,027
A'ight, a'ight.

541
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:06,475
Yo, Champion,
I got this cell phone.

542
00:22:06,507 --> 00:22:07,522
It's brand-fucking-new.

543
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:08,937
You gotta buy this shit from me.
Look.

544
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:10,117
I don't do cell phones, man.

545
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:11,584
Put it back in your pocket.

546
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:13,416
Trying to set me up
or some shit, man.

547
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,339
- Ain't nobody trying
to set your ass up.

548
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,516
- You want to get rid of it,
man?

549
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,654
Go right there-
172nd, Rosedale.

550
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,374
Little corner store,
close to the corner, man.

551
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:24,451
Go right there to the back.
They got you.

552
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,879
They always send that shit back
to they country, man.

553
00:22:26,922 --> 00:22:28,384
- So they give you the money
straight up?

554
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:29,540
No bullshit?

555
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:30,855
- Yeah, man,
I'm schooling you right now.

556
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,068
I'm schooling you right-

557
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,351
You don't know everything
in this fucking-

558
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,368
You a young girl!

559
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,490
- Whatever.
- Fuck, man.

560
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,578
- You don't know everything
either.

561
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:38,341
- Still got a lot to learn.
- Shut up.

562
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,135
- Fuck, I'm trying to help
your dumb ass.

563
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,796
- Shut the fuck up,
Champion.

564
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,867
- Fuck wrong with these fucking
young uns today, man?

565
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,182
Fucking think they know-

566
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:48,127
they fuckin' don't know
they ass from they elbow.

567
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:21,383
- Yo.
I want-

568
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:24,416
- You gotta do that shit
outside.

569
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:25,885
A'ight.

570
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,259
So you just gonna give me
my money here?

571
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,506
What?

572
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:34,886
What the fuck?

573
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,090
What, you call this nigga
from the back to lock the door?

574
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:39,233
I didn't call nobody.

575
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:41,638
- Just give me
my damn money, then.

576
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,078
What money you talking about?

577
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,671
- What you mean,
what money I'm talking about?

578
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,118
You saw me go in the back,
knock on the door,

579
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,231
and give this nigga
a $200 phone.

580
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,613
You know you saw that shit.

581
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,054
- Yo, you need to go home
with all-

582
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:51,810
- Don't try to play me
like I'm stupid.

583
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,846
And this nigga right here,
what, you a bodega bouncer?

584
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:57,221
Punk-ass nigga
hiding behind a door.

585
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,239
A'ight, just give me $50.

586
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:03,522
$50 for what?

587
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,966
For coming into my store?

588
00:24:04,998 --> 00:24:06,886
- No, $50 for the fucking phone
I gave him.

589
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,292
- I don't know what phone
you talking about.

590
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:09,341
- You know what?
I'm sorry.

591
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,389
Just give me $30.

592
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,804
What?

593
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:14,082
Don't fucking act stupid.

594
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:15,612
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about!

595
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,864
You need to go home.

596
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,015
Fuck you!

597
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,777
And fuck you too,
both of y'all bitches

598
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:22,050
hiding behind
a fucking plastic door.

599
00:24:24,293 --> 00:24:26,017
You want to scrape me
for a fucking phone?

600
00:24:26,053 --> 00:24:27,297
Here.

601
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,570
Scrape that shit, bitch.

602
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,773
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

603
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,970
You know that's real, right?

604
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:49,434
That's fucked up.

605
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:50,720
No, it's a good one.

606
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,163
See how many teeth he has?

607
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:54,301
That's how you price a skull,
number of teeth.

608
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,901
That shit is sick, okay?

609
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,282
That can't be legal.

610
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:58,461
It can't.

611
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,889
Probably isn't.

612
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,176
Here, sit.

613
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:04,099
- Don't know if I trust you,
crazy.

614
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:08,767
So...

615
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:10,364
Have you met
Donnie's girlfriend?

616
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:11,516
Yeah, I know Eleonore.

617
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:12,930
She cool peoples.

618
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,654
She's, like, a hippie and shit.

619
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:17,147
You can't be a hippie, okay?

620
00:25:17,187 --> 00:25:18,267
What you mean?

621
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:19,867
- It's, like,
an olden times thing.

622
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:22,296
It's like saying
she's a Victorian courtesan

623
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:25,055
or a Mayan princess
or something.

624
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,414
Anyway, he cheats on her.

625
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,141
So what?

626
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:34,139
- No, but he cheats on her
with, like, vagabonds.

627
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:36,218
What the fuck is vagabonds?

628
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,720
Vagabonds are...

629
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:38,842
Well, okay.

630
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:40,126
So this one time,
Donnie and I

631
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:41,723
were getting cash
out of an ATM,

632
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:43,802
and there was
this old Hispanic woman

633
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,922
cleaning the floor-

634
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,850
like, the janitor or something.

635
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:50,494
And she was really old
and really fat.

636
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,478
Okay.

637
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:53,082
And Donnie picked her up.

638
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:54,528
No way.

639
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:55,838
Way.

640
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,946
He picked her up,
and he took her home,

641
00:25:57,985 --> 00:25:59,327
and he fucked her.

642
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:00,441
In his own bed!

643
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:01,561
No!

644
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,641
Yo, you serious?

645
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:05,503
I really wish I wasn't.

646
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:06,682
It's disgusting!

647
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,023
He sleeps with, like,
semi-homeless girls.

648
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:12,123
- Yo, oh, my God.
He fucks old ladies.

649
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,753
That's crazy.

650
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:15,287
You don't even understand
how much shit

651
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:16,790
I'm gonna give him for this.

652
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,775
Shit, this is gold.

653
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:20,246
Here, do you want some?

654
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,197
Vagabonds.

655
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:34,711
- I-
- I, uh-

656
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:36,278
- Go, go, go, go.
Go.

657
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,108
Um, no, you first.

658
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:39,704
- No, no, no.
Just go.

659
00:26:39,743 --> 00:26:41,947
Mine was really dumb.

660
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:44,023
Mine was worse.

661
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,103
I bet you mine was worse.

662
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:48,510
- You will lose that bet.
Promise.

663
00:26:48,543 --> 00:26:50,747
- Well, in that case,
it's a bet.

664
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:53,303
And if I win,

665
00:26:53,343 --> 00:26:54,903
you have to give me free weed.

666
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,634
- I don't know about that,
but...

667
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,263
Come on.

668
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:01,847
All right.

669
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,123
- Okay, now you have to pick
something.

670
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:09,242
If I win...

671
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:10,839
You gotta give me
your necklace.

672
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:13,082
- What?
No way.

673
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:15,420
Um, look around.

674
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:16,469
Pick something else.

675
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,397
- There's a lot of stuff
in here.

676
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,317
What do you want?

677
00:27:23,197 --> 00:27:27,158
- If I win,
you have to give me...

678
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,499
A kiss.

679
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,457
Okay.

680
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:38,651
I was going to ask you

681
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:43,125
if you've ever written your name
in the sidewalks...

682
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,888
Not that I recall.

683
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:46,550
- When they pour
the wet cement in

684
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:47,537
and it's all new?

685
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:48,595
Mm-mm.

686
00:27:48,637 --> 00:27:50,840
- I've done that,
with a key.

687
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:55,186
And I have my name in sidewalks
all over the city now.

688
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:58,010
I was thinking
that's sort of like graffiti.

689
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,637
Yeah.

690
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:03,192
- Anyway,
what were you gonna say?

691
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,400
I guess I should leave.

692
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:11,313
"I guess I should leave"?

693
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:13,781
Wait, that's terrible.

694
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,542
That's so much worse
than mine.

695
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,652
- I know.
I won.

696
00:28:21,946 --> 00:28:24,335
I guess you did.

697
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,810
Hang on one second.

698
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,449
So weird.
Donnie's here.

699
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:19,732
What?

700
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,328
- What's the matter?
- He comin' up?

701
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:22,961
- Yeah, he's in the elevator.
- Fuck!

702
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:25,842
The top lock.

703
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,675
- Where's your phone?
Fuck it.

704
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:42,070
That's my number.
Call me, all right?

705
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:43,696
Okay.

706
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,237
Bye.

707
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,766
Where the fuck is Malcolm?

708
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:05,261
I don't know.

709
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,490
- I got this.
I got this, yo.

710
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,500
# It began with an energy
similar to intensity

711
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,785
# Brought by greater divinity

712
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,066
# Saw our missions
infinitely

713
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:28,175
# Same with this energy

714
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:29,293
# It's just rippin'
and killin' me

715
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,413
# My tango went
unwillingly

716
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,533
# Body moving frivolously

717
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:34,897
# Yeah,
I be standing visibly

718
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,012
# Yo, music is my life

719
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:37,296
# And just the choruses
are cold

720
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,478
# This rhythm is in my veins

721
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:39,793
# And for it,
there's no antidote

722
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:40,908
# Yo, music is my life

723
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,192
# And just the choruses
are cold

724
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,374
# This rhythm is in my veins

725
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,268
# And for it,
there's no antidote #

726
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,300
- Shit.
Let's go.

727
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,747
Yeah, yeah.
What up?

728
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,852
That's right.
Score, score.

729
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,083
- Check.
Check.

730
00:30:56,116 --> 00:30:57,098
Check.
Yes, you did.

731
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,595
What up, Al?

732
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:08,811
How you doing?

733
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:12,777
They letting you play today?

734
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,267
Keep your head up, kid.

735
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:21,969
Oh, yeah.

736
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:24,523
Superstar got the ball.

737
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,766
He don't want it.
He don't want it.

738
00:31:29,362 --> 00:31:30,824
Damn!

739
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:33,087
Who's talking now?

740
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:34,522
You, obviously!

741
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,623
You, obviously!

742
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,844
- Shut up.
Get off the court.

743
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:38,126
- You talkin' all that shit,
like you nice...

744
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,242
Next!

745
00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:40,657
- Knowing damn good and well
you ain't nothing.

746
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,900
Talking shit like you can dunk?
You can dunk?

747
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:43,050
Let me see something.

748
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:44,333
I got 5 saying
you can't dunk right now.

749
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,257
- I can't dunk?
5 what?

750
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,948
5 cash?
- 5 cash, right now.

Right now. Come on.

752
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:52,427
Talk that bullshit.

Your boy gonna-

754
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:55,625
- Okay, shut up.
Let me dunk, then.

755
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,453
- 5 right now.
We'll see.

756
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:58,863
We'll see.
Money talks.

757
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:00,391
Money talks.

758
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,026
Yeah, but you shut up.

759
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:04,007
Get the hell out of here.
Get the hell out of here.

760
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,031
Bullshit, man.

761
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:06,087
Out of here, boy.

762
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:07,437
I'm tired of him, son.

763
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,545
Sofie!

764
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:11,656
What's up?

765
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,063
- What's going on?
Ah!

766
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:15,045
What you doing here?

767
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:16,103
I'm looking for you.

768
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,126
You looking for me?

769
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,892
- Yes, you.
- What's up?

770
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:21,132
I need to push some cans.

771
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:22,575
So we all business now?

772
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,786
Nah.

773
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:25,231
Oh, all right, I got you.

774
00:32:25,264 --> 00:32:26,508
Let me get this for you.
- Thank you.

775
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,965
- Yo!
What's up, y'all?

776
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:31,430
Yo, you smell that?

777
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:32,716
- What you talking about,
Rico?

778
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:33,798
Ah, summer, baby,

779
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,749
when everything in this city
smells like ass.

780
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,969
You know what I mean?

781
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,152
The dogs smell like ass.

782
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,271
The streets smell like ass.

783
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,260
The food smell like ass.

784
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,318

785
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,853
Whoo! Damn, girl,

786
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,390

00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:46,318

788
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:47,812
Oh, I know it.

00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:49,578
Yo, I heard you and your man

00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:51,175

791
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:52,459
He's not my fucking boyfriend,

00:32:52,495 --> 00:32:55,178

00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,347
Woodside?

795
00:32:58,382 --> 00:32:59,943
That's what them dicks

00:32:59,982 --> 00:33:02,120
- Yo, regardless, I heard

00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:09,894

mama.

803
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,210
- I can handle

804
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,424
- A'ight.

805
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,185

00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,322
Dude, come on, son.

810
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,609
Fuckin' asshole.

811
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:23,271
- Get out of here.
Stop acting all foul, son.

812
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,684
Yo, her mood is foul, man.

813
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:25,797
- Yo, you the one
comin' off foul, son.

814
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,786
Yo, what's good?

815
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:28,073
You left your dildo at home
or somethin'?

816
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,564
- Why, you need it
to thrust it up your ass?

817
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:31,848
- Wow.
Look, look.

818
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,794
Just tell your man to stop
fucking with those cats.

819
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:35,844
- I keep telling you that's not
my fucking boyfriend.

820
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:36,997
- Oh, really?
Why not?

821
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,280
What's wrong?

822
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,226
He ain't giving it to you right
or somethin'?

823
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,635
I think you need some of this
circumcised prize, baby.

824
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:44,043
- Yeah, keep humping
the fuckin' fence,

825
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:45,865
'cause that's the only pussy
you'll be getting.

826
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:47,308
God, son.

827
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,347
Damn.
Why's he gotta go hard?

828
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:50,665
Extra, man.

829
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,326
WKO?

830
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,925
Yeah, Woodside King Orew.

831
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:55,174
Something like that.

832
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:56,935
Toys, total fucking toys.

833
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,426
- Yeah, they got some weak game,
but they a'ight.

834
00:33:59,468 --> 00:34:00,842
They solid customers, though.

835
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,152
They buy from you?

836
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,162
They don't rack their own shit?

837
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,577
Fuckin' bitch-ass niggas.

838
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:06,855
I fuckin' knew it.

839
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:08,615
- They just kids-
youngsters.

840
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:09,731
They'll get theirs.

841
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:10,818
Don't worry about it.
Damn!

842
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,907
I'm not worried.

843
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,059
You're not worried?

844
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:14,855
- No, I'm not worried.
Do I look worried?

845
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:16,004
Sofie, you look worried.

846
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:17,319
I ain't worried about shit.

847
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,362
- You should've saw you
back there, acting all crazy.

848
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:21,569
Yo, what's up, man?

849
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,171
We chillin' with my boy RX,
in from Philly.

850
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,454
From north Philly, right?

851
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:25,952
Exactly.

852
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,555
Hitting all the freight trains
out there.

853
00:34:27,594 --> 00:34:28,903
Legendary, legendary shit.

854
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,018
You can check him out online.

855
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:31,619
Check him out
in old graff mags, man.

856
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:33,219
He's been around for a minute,
for sure.

857
00:34:33,258 --> 00:34:35,080
- You racked all these cans
in one week?

858
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,798
- Something like that.
I had to step my game up.

859
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,038
Look, I got these sneakers.
I gotta sell these shits.

860
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:41,961
I don't know if you can do
somethin' with them or...

861
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:43,717
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where you got these at?

862
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,143
- Long story. I can't even
get into that right now.

863
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,974
- Yeah, so, like,
$70 for the kicks is good?

864
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:48,937
Perfect.

865
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,049
- No doubt.
I got you.

866
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:53,886
So that's $60 for the cans.

867
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,158
And I got you with $70
for the kicks.

868
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,463
But wait, I don't have change,
so just take $80,

869
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,642
extra $10 for you.

870
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,208
It's cool.
Don't worry about it.

871
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:03,655
Thank you.

872
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:04,769
You're welcome.

873
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:05,757
Thank you very much.

874
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:06,946
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

875
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,025
So you should come over later.

876
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,309
Oh, word?

877
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:11,522
- Yeah.
- For what?

878
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,989
Oh, we're having, like-

879
00:35:13,032 --> 00:35:15,236
It's gonna be a lot of people,
not only you and me, of course,

880
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:17,247
but it's gonna be a lot of us
just chilling,

881
00:35:17,288 --> 00:35:18,815
so I think you should
come through.

882
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:22,151
- Thanks for the invite,
but I'm kind of busy tonight.

883
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:24,224
- Ah, really?
- Got some shit to take care of.

884
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:26,151
- I mean, you can come anytime,
so...

885
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:27,166
Oh, anytime?

886
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:28,582
Yeah.

887
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:30,525
I mean, so after that,
even if the thing is done,

888
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:31,680
you can just come over,
so...

889
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,799
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, so...

890
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,334
- Just-okay.
All right.

891
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:36,743
I'll see you then?

892
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:37,790
I'll think about it.

893
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:38,846
Oh, you'll think about it?

894
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:39,869
Yeah, I'll think about it.

895
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:41,285
I'll see you later, Sofie.

896
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,543
All right.

897
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,199
Yo.

898
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,246
Yo, baby, what's good?

899
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:05,764
- Yo, fucking check
her pockets.

900
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,897
Yo, calm the fuck down.

901
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,934
This bitch is crazy.
Shit!

902
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:13,217
Check that bitch-

903
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,366
Oh, shit!

904
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,307
- Oh, you suck dick for that,
huh?

905
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,910
God damn!

906
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:19,964
Yo, buff her, buff her.

907
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:21,281
- Don't fucking write
on my shirt!

908
00:36:21,318 --> 00:36:22,911
Don't fucking buff my shirt!

909
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,836
Yo, do it, yeah!

910
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,113
I hope you enjoy that shit.

911
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,710
That's the first time
you ever touch titties?

912
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:29,090
That'll be
your fuckin' last time!

913
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,619
Yo, shut the fuck up!

914
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:31,938
- And tell
your little girlfriend

915
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:33,762
that we just fucked his bitch!

916
00:36:33,797 --> 00:36:35,488
Fuck you.

917
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:37,051
No, fuck you!

918
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:39,231
Fuck all y'all Queens
motherfuckers!

919
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,894
Y'all will never bomb like us!

920
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,045
BX in the building!

921
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:43,807
Come to BX
and try that fuckin' shit!

922
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:45,438
Punk ass!

923
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,024
Oh, I know that's not

924
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,376
that skinny fuckin' piece
of Timon-looking...

925
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,849
You fucking set this shit up?

926
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:55,136
That's what the fuck you did?

927
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,513
Answer me when I'm fuckin'
talkin' to you!

928
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,627
- Whoa, easy, little girl.
I told you-

929
00:36:57,668 --> 00:36:58,911
- Don't tell me
to fuckin' be easy!

930
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:00,257
- I told you don't fuck
with their turf, right?

931
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,047
- You fucking set this up?
You fucking did this?

932
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,261
Whoa, whoa, little girl.

933
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,609
Don't fucking touch me.

934
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:06,204
- I told you, stop fucking
with those cats, right?

935
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:08,130
- What, your mother taught you
to go around beating up ladies?

936
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,945
- Yo, first of all,
you ain't no lady, bitch!

937
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,151
Man, fuck you!

938
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:15,096
Fuck you too!

939
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:18,366
Get the fuck out of here.

940
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:34,907
# Well, I say, if it wasn't

941
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:37,247
# For the Lord

942
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:38,558
# How would I know?

943
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:41,049
# What would I do?

944
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,300
# Tell me, what

945
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:43,286
# What

946
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,311
# What would I do?

947
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:45,302
# Would I do?

948
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,294
# I want to know

949
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:47,286
# Oh, what

950
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:48,278
# What

951
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:49,695
# Would I do? #

952
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:52,950
Yo.

953
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:56,540
I'm in love, yo.

954
00:37:56,577 --> 00:37:58,170
I met this fucking girl
today.

955
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,703
Oh, my God.

956
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,654
What the fuck happened to you?

957
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,248
Yo, shit gotta fucking end,
Sofia.

958
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,433
I'm tired of this shit, yo.

959
00:38:09,473 --> 00:38:10,585
I'm fuckin' tired
of these niggas, yo.

960
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:11,737
I'm tired of them.

961
00:38:11,776 --> 00:38:12,889
I'm gonna fuckin' kill
one of them, yo.

962
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:14,073
Their fuckin' moms
gonna be crying, yo.

963
00:38:14,112 --> 00:38:15,257
- Your fuckin' mom's
gonna be crying

964
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:16,671
that she even birthed you.

965
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:18,744
There's, like,
12 of them niggas out there.

966
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:19,897
- Listen,
they just fucking with us

967
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,245
'cause I roll with a girl, man.

968
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,589
- Fuckin' with us
'cause you roll with a girl?

969
00:38:22,624 --> 00:38:23,737
No, I think they fucking with me

970
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:25,336
'cause I roll with
a easy target like you.

971
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:26,652
Always talking shit.

972
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:28,987
- Look,
I'ma let that slide.

973
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,747
Listen, let's just keep our eyes
on the prize, man.

974
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:32,060
Once we bomb this apple,
nothing-

975
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:33,656
yo, nothing they did
is gonna mean nothing, man.

976
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,939
We gonna fuckin' make history
in their backyards.

977
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:35,990
- Look, you need
to let that shit go.

978
00:38:36,031 --> 00:38:37,373
We don't have
no fucking money,

979
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:39,000
we don't have no plan,
and if we did have some money,

980
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,152
you gonna give it
to some nigga

981
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:41,271
that you don't even
fucking know?

982
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:42,555
That's stupid!

983
00:38:42,591 --> 00:38:43,736
- No, I'm telling you,
Pedro is good for it, man.

984
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:45,782
You don't know shit.

985
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:47,764
You're not even fuckin' wearin'
sneakers.

986
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,017
No-sneakers-havin'-

987
00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:51,575
What the fuck happened
to your sneakers?

988
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,365
- I'm telling you
I got something big, yo.

989
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,347
No.

990
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,852
- No, listen-
- No!

991
00:38:56,894 --> 00:38:58,781
- Listen, remember the fuckin'
girl I was telling you about?

992
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,308
My love, Ginnie?

993
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,034
Listen, her fucking parents
got that bread, like,

994
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,477
that Nantucket money,
like...

995
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,333
Look, and in her room,
there was this case, right?

996
00:39:06,366 --> 00:39:08,221
It was a case full of jewelry,
full of-

997
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:10,490
Yo, I know how to get it.

998
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:17,178
You gonna have enough money
to move out.

999
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,832
You got five minutes.

1000
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:26,170
- Yo, so all we gotta do
is get the key, and we good.

1001
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:27,765
- So is there, like,
diamonds in there?

1002
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:29,593
Like, can you give me
a little bit more information-

1003
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:30,676
- Hell yeah,
there was diamonds.

1004
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,506
There were fucking diamonds,
rubies, pearls-

1005
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,621
So what's the plan, then?

1006
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:35,068
- The plan?
The plan is, I seduce her.

1007
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:36,595
The plan is, you seduce her?

1008
00:39:36,637 --> 00:39:38,328
You serious?

1009
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:40,022
Nigga, you couldn't seduce
a prostitute

1010
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,995
if you had, like,
hundreds all in your hands.

1011
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:44,597
- You don't understand.
This girl is on my dick.

1012
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:45,716
All I gotta do-listen.

1013
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:47,250
All I got to do
is go upstairs, right?

1014
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:48,853
Get her naked, right?

1015
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:50,168
Fuck her real quick,
you know-

1016
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:51,611
- Sucker, you think I want
to hear this shit?

1017
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,749
- Why you gotta hit me
so fucking hard, though?

1018
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:56,406
So did you even use a condom?

1019
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:57,688
I ain't fuck her yet.

1020
00:39:57,723 --> 00:39:59,512
Wait, wait, hold up.

1021
00:39:59,547 --> 00:40:01,041
You telling me
you didn't fuck her yet

1022
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:03,123
but she got you fucked up
in the head like that already?

1023
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:04,146
It's not even like that.

1024
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:05,529
- I thought you was harder
than that.

1025
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:06,545
You fuckin' soft.

1026
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,180
- Listen, I'm a gentleman.
- You ain't shit.

1027
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,202
If I fucked her,

1028
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,737
I wasn't gonna wear no condom
anyway, though.

1029
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:12,273
- Oh, real smart, Malcolm.
Real smart.

1030
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:13,558
- Whatever.
Oondoms suck, Sofia.

1031
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:14,740
How the fuck would you know?

1032
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,910
That one bitch that one time?
Meredith?

1033
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,408
- Listen-
- She looked like a dude, son.

1034
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,879
- Stop hating on my shit.
- Her name was "Man. "

1035
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,483
- Stop hatin' on my shit
'cause you don't get no dick.

1036
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:24,082
Her nickname was "Manny. "

1037
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:25,300
Whatever.

1038
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,378
The fact is, like,
everybody knows condoms suck.

1039
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:28,663
You would think,
after all this time,

1040
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:30,072
they'd have made
something better, like-

1041
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:31,829
- How exactly do they wrap
your dick better?

1042
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,721
Like, that's the dumbest shit
I've ever heard.

1043
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:35,183
- Why does it have to go
all the way down?

1044
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:36,306
See, that's what I'm saying.

1045
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,939
Like, why can't it just
cover the tip,

1046
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,385
let the shaft
get all the juices?

1047
00:40:39,418 --> 00:40:41,272
- That's fuckin' disgusting.
Shut the fuck up.

1048
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,680
- I'm saying
they should just cup it.

1049
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:44,175
- Oup it like what?
Like a little hat?

1050
00:40:44,217 --> 00:40:45,297
Like a fitted?

1051
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:47,793
- Oh, no, but kind of-
no, like a yarmulke.

1052
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:49,426
What the fuck is a yarmulke?

1053
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,352
One of those little Jew hats.

1054
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:53,524
I... I don't know what that is.

1055
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,990
- Yo, the shit
that Mr. Donowitz wears,

1056
00:40:55,033 --> 00:40:56,113
the little black thing
on his head.

1057
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,233
- Oh, the thing
with the bobby pins in it?

1058
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:58,255
Yes.

1059
00:40:58,297 --> 00:40:59,540
- How the fuck was I supposed
to know that's Jewish?

1060
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:00,657
What the fuck you think?

1061
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:01,973
He was trying to make
a fashion statement?

1062
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:03,797
- I don't fuckin' know,
but all I know is,

1063
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,037
until they start making
little rubber Hanukkahs,

1064
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,665
I suggest you wrap your dick
proper,

1065
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,133
or else that shit
just gonna fall off

1066
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,256
and roll down a fuckin' hill.

1067
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:12,369
- Nah, yo, I bet you
she's a virgin.

1068
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:13,390
So?

1069
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:15,604
Virgins can have babies,
Malcolm.

1070
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,527
Whatever.

1071
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,153
- We should just rob this bitch
straight up.

1072
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:20,207
Fuck that shit.

1073
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:21,230
Nah, I already told you,

1074
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,450
I don't want
no face-to-face on this.

1075
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:23,601
And plus,
I don't want to scare her.

1076
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,720
- What the fuck you mean,
you don't want

1077
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,840
no fucking face-to-face
on this shit?

1078
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,919
You just met this bitch.
Fuck that bitch.

1079
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,999
Look, you always sayin',

1080
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:31,501
"Oh, we gonna be
the biggest writers

1081
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:32,558
in New York City. "

1082
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:36,148
Well, do what you gotta do
to make that shit happen.

1083
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:38,518
- You don't even understand what
I just went through earlier.

1084
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:39,926
I got this.

1085
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:41,421
All I gotta do is wait for her
to come out her building,

1086
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,285
act like I'm bumping into her,
like, "Oh, shit. "

1087
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,496
She's going to invite me
back upstairs.

1088
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,095
- With no shoes on.
- Whatever.

1089
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:47,248
She gonna invite me
back upstairs.

1090
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:48,432
You know what I'm saying?

1091
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,194
And I'm gonna get up in it,
take the chain,

1092
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,310
and be out, so smooth.

1093
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,463
It's gonna be so easy, yo.

1094
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:56,431
- Malcolm,
you are so dumb.

1095
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,707
- You don't understand, man.
I got this in the bag.

1096
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,474
That shit right there,
that shit remind me

1097
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,452
of the thing that we did
with Scoop and Dash.

1098
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,860
Remember?

1099
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:09,585
- Oh, yeah,
it does look like that shit.

1100
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:10,767
Fucking crazy face.

1101
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:12,180
Yeah,
that's they signature shit.

1102
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:14,286
- Yeah.
I like that blue shit too.

1103
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:17,493
- Tryin' to help
your weak-ass book out.

1104
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,827
- Please, girl.
You ain't all that.

1105
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:22,861
- Nigga,
so why you jacking my shit?

1106
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:24,789
- Whoo!
Guess who it is?

1107
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:27,025
My wifey wants another delivery.

1108
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,200
- Good.
Go get that fucking necklace.

1109
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:30,578
That's not all I'ma get.

1110
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:31,856
You know what "delivery" means?

1111
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,933
Do you know what-
It means dick.

1112
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:36,177
I'm about to get some pussy,
with dirty socks on.

1113
00:42:36,212 --> 00:42:37,805
Ha! Out!

1114
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,081
- NYPD!
- What the fuck?

1115
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:49,393
You must be the drug dealer.

1116
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:51,315
Yeah, where's Ginnie?

1117
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:52,810
What's the magic word?

1118
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:54,226
I... I don't know.

1119
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,601
Nope.

1120
00:42:55,636 --> 00:42:56,813
Um...

1121
00:42:56,852 --> 00:42:59,569
- It's not "um. "
It's not "I don't know. "

1122
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:02,353
- Look, I need to see her.
She has my shoes.

1123
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:04,045
- You think she's cuter
than me?

1124
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,872
She has my sneakers.

1125
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:08,465
You have no shoes.

1126
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:09,481
Yeah, I know.

1127
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:11,083
Where's your shoes at?

1128
00:43:11,123 --> 00:43:12,748
She has 'em.

1129
00:43:12,786 --> 00:43:14,674
- Well, you should probably
take off your socks,

1130
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:16,233
'cause Ginnie's mom's
not gonna want you

1131
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:19,274
bringing the street
into the house.

1132
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:21,202
Wait, but you have on heels.

1133
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:23,754
I'm a lot cleaner than you.

1134
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,583
Follow me.

1135
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:29,711
Here's the drug dealer.

1136
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:31,819
Everybody say,
"Hello, drug dealer. "

1137
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:34,062
Hello, drug dealer.

1138
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:35,854
What's up?

1139
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,191
Donnie's not here, right?

1140
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:39,535
- Why?
You scared?

1141
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:41,325
Nah, just...

1142
00:43:41,362 --> 00:43:42,703
Yo, you got my shoes?

1143
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:44,843
No.

1144
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:46,823
Donnie took them.

1145
00:43:46,865 --> 00:43:48,109
Fuck.

1146
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:50,349
- Anyway, we need 100.
Money's on the table.

1147
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:52,490
- All right, I got two 50s,
but...

1148
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,285
Whatever.

1149
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,426
So what you been up to?

1150
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:57,872
- I'm good.
You?

1151
00:43:57,904 --> 00:43:59,628
I'm all right.

1152
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:02,410
That was fast.

1153
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:05,515
I called you, like,
two seconds ago.

1154
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:07,919
You're not stalking me
or anything, are you?

1155
00:44:07,953 --> 00:44:09,197
- What?
No.

1156
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:12,548
I was just doing some deliveries
in the neighborhood.

1157
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:14,348
Was it on Bethune?

1158
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:15,944
Was it that asshole Benny
on Bethune?

1159
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:17,839
Um, I don't know.

1160
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,628
I think-
I think it was on-

1161
00:44:19,664 --> 00:44:20,711
If Benny shows up tonight,

1162
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:22,540
I'm not talking to him,
no matter what.

1163
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,623
You're not either.

1164
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:24,908
No, not a word.

1165
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:26,798
Is Benny the blond one?

1166
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,042
No, no, no.

1167
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,192
That's Aaron Childs.

1168
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,638
- That's your blondie.
- Yup.

1169
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,078
That's your boy,

1170
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:33,998
which, I can't believe
that you like him.

1171
00:44:34,031 --> 00:44:36,235
- It's just that we've known him
way too long.

1172
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,158
He's not that bad.

1173
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,467
He's a monster.

1174
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,477
- Hey, don't offer him
any product.

1175
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,518
- Aaron, like, called me out
on it all of a sudden.

1176
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,664
- I mean, of course,
have some.

1177
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:47,815
Here.

1178
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:49,993
- No, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1179
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,780
I was just joking.

1180
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,084
Don't be that way.
Here.

1181
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,671
- Nah, really,
I'm-I'm really cool.

1182
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,692
I'm good.

1183
00:44:58,735 --> 00:45:01,222
You're really cool?

1184
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:06,789
He's really cool.

1185
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,146
- That's not what I meant.
That's not what I meant.

1186
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:11,978
Yo, did I tell you

1187
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:15,363
that I'm gonna bomb
the Shea Stadium apple?

1188
00:45:15,406 --> 00:45:17,129
- I think it's called
Citi Field.

1189
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,343
What's the apple?

1190
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,007
- Oh, it's like,
when the Mets hit a home run,

1191
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:21,868
it's, like, this big, goofy,
like, plastic apple

1192
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,079
that comes up; it's crazy.

1193
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:24,677
- And you're gonna draw graffiti
on it?

1194
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:25,961
Yeah.

1195
00:45:25,997 --> 00:45:27,655
That's so stupid.

1196
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:30,114
That's fucking retarded.

1197
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,750
No, it's not.

1198
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:34,155
I'm a Yankees fan, so...

1199
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,236
My dad's a Yankees fan.

1200
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:36,902
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1201
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,460
Good-bye, drug dealer.

1202
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:41,540
It's Malcolm.

1203
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:44,811
Excuse me.

1204
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:46,251
Girls,
say good-bye to Malcolm.

1205
00:45:46,284 --> 00:45:48,323
- Bye, Malcolm.
- Good-bye, Malcolm.

1206
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:50,469
- Yo, whatever, man.
Whatever.

1207
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:52,515
- "Whatever"?
We love you.

1208
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:53,962
Girls, say, "We love you"
to Malcolm.

1209
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:56,068
We love you, Malcolm!

1210
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,619
Oh, well.

1211
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,700
We should bring him
to Betty's party.

1212
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,397
That would be a riot.

1213
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:14,339
- And, like, I wanted
to feel sympathetic,

1214
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:16,745
except, the whole time, he was,
like, complaining about...

1215
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,377
- So you get the necklace
or what?

1216
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,679
- You know
I take care of my shit.

1217
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:34,536
Let's rob this bitch.

1218
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:35,944
Oh, shit.

1219
00:46:35,978 --> 00:46:37,603
Nigga, where you going?

1220
00:46:37,642 --> 00:46:39,365
Why you mad?

1221
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:42,435
Now that I think about it,
you was gone only two minutes.

1222
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:45,026
Still ain't get
your sneakers back, mm-mm-mm.

1223
00:46:45,065 --> 00:46:47,105
- I don't know, but he needs
to get the fuck out here.

1224
00:46:47,145 --> 00:46:48,520
Believe this shit, man?

1225
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:50,692
These fuckers ain't got
no vanilla Dutches, man.

1226
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:52,671
They call this shit
a cigar shop?

1227
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:54,142
Come on.
We gonna go to this newsstand.

1228
00:46:54,185 --> 00:46:55,591
- What you think?
You didn't tell me-

1229
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,869
Like, you didn't give me
an answer yet.

1230
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:58,629
- No, but I think-
I like what I hear, man.

1231
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:00,192
Sofia, you follow that bitch.

1232
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,437
Once she leaves her spot,
keep a eye out.

1233
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:03,999
Let us know
when she's comin' back.

1234
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,796
Me and Malcolm sneak in.

1235
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,556
I pick that lock, easy-easy.

1236
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,250
Champion saves
the motherfuckin' day.

1237
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:10,696
- "Champion saves
the motherfuckin' day"?

1238
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:12,768
Nigga, don't forget
this is me and Malcolm's deal.

1239
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,532
- What the fuck?
Y'all jewel thieves now?

1240
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:15,648
Maybe.

1241
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:17,575
- So what the fuck
you wasting my time for?

1242
00:47:17,608 --> 00:47:20,924
Why you calling me up
with this bullshit, man?

1243
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:23,171
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Don't worry.

1244
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,477
We gonna-I'm gonna break you
off a nice cut.

1245
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:26,918
- Break us off a cut?
Nigger-

1246
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:28,642
- Come on. Keep it up.
- Fuck this shit.

1247
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,174
Malcolm,
I'll do it my fucking self.

1248
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:31,589
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Fuck that.

1249
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:33,663
Look, when we pawn that shit,
we'll give you 20%.

1250
00:47:33,703 --> 00:47:36,420
- 20%?
Nah, I pawn 'em; you get 20%.

1251
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:38,560
- Nigga,
you out your fucking mind.

1252
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:41,282
Fucking crazy-ass nigga.

1253
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:42,945
- Hold up.
Let me get a Dutch.

1254
00:47:42,983 --> 00:47:44,063
You got vanilla Dutch?

1255
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:45,728
- No Dutch.
- No Dutches?

1256
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:48,931
Come on, let me explain
something to you, man, a'ight?

1257
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,341
Y'all get locked up?

1258
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:53,156
Five years probation.
Y'all coming home the next day.

1259
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:54,467
No need to worry.

1260
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:55,582
Me, I get locked up?

1261
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,476
Three-time predicate-
I'm going down.

1262
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,136
So if I'm gonna rob
a rich white bitch,

1263
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:01,541
believe me, I'm gonna take
my proper cut.

1264
00:48:03,238 --> 00:48:04,351
Fuck it.

1265
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,851
We'll give you 50%,
but that's it.

1266
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:07,486
- That's what I'm talking.
That's what I'm talking.

1267
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:08,606
I like that.
- A'ight.

1268
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:10,369
- A'ight, I'ma keep
one of them stones, a'ight?

1269
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:11,867
- Keep one of them stones?
- For my bitch.

1270
00:48:11,909 --> 00:48:13,251
- Nigga, that's coming out
your cut.

1271
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:14,944
- Nah, you can charge that
to the game, bitch.

1272
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:15,963
Just don't fuck it up.

1273
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:17,282
I'm Champion, baby.

1274
00:48:17,317 --> 00:48:19,008
Champion never fucks up.

1275
00:48:23,812 --> 00:48:24,925
I don't understand, like,

1276
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:26,558
why we don't just
burst in there.

1277
00:48:26,596 --> 00:48:27,709
What's wrong with you, man?

1278
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:29,211
You stupid or something?

1279
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,162
Relax.
Calm down.

1280
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:38,593
- Well, turn on the fucking AO.
I'm hot, nigga.

1281
00:48:38,628 --> 00:48:41,824
- The AO drains my gas,
and I'll be damned-

1282
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,834
I'm not turning on my car.

1283
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,881
Well, turn on the radio.

1284
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,825
- Damn, bitch,
the radio broke too.

1285
00:48:48,868 --> 00:48:50,145
What the fuck?

1286
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,848
Hello?

1287
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,030
Yeah, Ma,
I can't talk right now.

1288
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:00,353
No, I've been working.
I've been working.

1289
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:01,948
Nah, me and Sofie-

1290
00:49:01,987 --> 00:49:03,416
me and Sofie
are helping this guy out.

1291
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,020
We-yeah,
but I can't talk right now.

1292
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:06,368
I'm gonna call you back,
all right?

1293
00:49:06,403 --> 00:49:08,291
All right.

1294
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:14,655
What the fuck are you doing?

1295
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,665
Jerking off
in the back of the fucking car?

1296
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:18,267
No, yo, I got stickage, yo.

1297
00:49:18,307 --> 00:49:20,314
What the fuck is stickage?

1298
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:21,499
He knows.

1299
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,033
It's, like, when your balls
and your dick

1300
00:49:23,075 --> 00:49:25,114
stick together, like...

1301
00:49:25,154 --> 00:49:26,398
I ain't never heard of that.

1302
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:28,092
You better go
to the fucking doctor.

1303
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,624
No, I don't need a doctor.

1304
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:30,614
I'm all right.

1305
00:49:34,178 --> 00:49:36,349
- Who's that stinking
like that?

1306
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:40,095
Why would you hang your
funky-ass socks in the window?

1307
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,846
- Stinking up the car, man,
for real.

1308
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,402
- No, that's them funky-ass TVs
in the back

1309
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,586
stinking up the car like that.

1310
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,032
- Listen,
them shits work, man.

1311
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:49,691
So hook that shit up!

1312
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,109
You ready?

1313
00:50:18,144 --> 00:50:19,551
We gonna do this shit
right here.

1314
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,919
All these buttons...

1315
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:52,884
UPS?

1316
00:50:56,414 --> 00:50:57,429
Come on.

1317
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,219
This is what I came here to do,
baby.

1318
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:02,458
Come on, man.
Stop playing, man.

1319
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:05,527
Oh, shit, easy as fuck, man.

1320
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:19,700
Come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up, man.

1321
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:22,130
- Come on.
We're on six now.

1322
00:51:22,173 --> 00:51:24,376
- Six?
We on seventh, man.

1323
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:25,820
Yo, we walked up six flights,

1324
00:51:25,852 --> 00:51:26,997
so we on the sixth floor.

1325
00:51:27,037 --> 00:51:28,793
- We on seventh, man.
You start from two, man.

1326
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,676
- What the fuck you mean,
"start from two"?

1327
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,076
One, two, three...

1328
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:35,057
- Nah, nah.
- Four.

1329
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,115
- You know what?
Come on.

1330
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:38,328
We gonna start from scratch.
We gonna start from scratch.

1331
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:39,793
I ain't gonna rob
the wrong house, man.

1332
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:41,014
No, this is it.

1333
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:42,459
- Come on.
We start from scratch, man.

1334
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:45,012
- No, no, no, wait.
- Let's do it.

1335
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,546
Come on.

1336
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:49,141
I don't feel like fuckin'
walking all the way down.

1337
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:02,872
- A'ight, youngster,
pay attention.

1338
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:04,467
A'ight, simple shit.

1339
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:07,540
Ground floor, second floor,
third floor, fourth floor,

1340
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:08,659
so on and so on.

1341
00:52:08,698 --> 00:52:09,680
Understand?

1342
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:10,900
All right, get to stepping.

1343
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:12,182
Come on.
I ain't got all day.

1344
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:13,495
- Why none of these
fucking people

1345
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,775
got numbers on their doors?

1346
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,697
- Fuckin' white people
don't take no stairs, man.

1347
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:48,334
You ain't tell me there were
gonna be two locks, man.

1348
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:50,516
Look at the size of that
motherfucker right there, man.

1349
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:53,106
- I mean, you said
you could do any locks.

1350
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:57,232
- A'ight, let me do my thing
right now, man.

1351
00:52:57,273 --> 00:52:58,799
Shut the fuck up.

1352
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:00,848
Let me show you how I do it.

1353
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:02,317
A'ight,
this is what I do, a'ight?

1354
00:53:12,888 --> 00:53:14,415
Yo.

1355
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:17,391
Yo, fuck it.
You got a phone?

1356
00:53:17,432 --> 00:53:18,577
Let's Google that shit.

1357
00:53:18,616 --> 00:53:20,023
Google how to pick a lock.

1358
00:53:20,056 --> 00:53:21,365
- What, you trying to play me,
nigga,

1359
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,806
like I can't do my job,
nigga?

1360
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Think this is a fuckin' joke,
man?

1361
00:53:24,439 --> 00:53:26,032
Think I'm here
for fuckin' nothing?

1362
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,086
Trying to do this shit, man.

1363
00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:28,207
Give me a fuckin' minute, man.

1364
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,196
You see me sweating, man.

1365
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,515
You ain't tell me

1366
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:32,373
this motherfucker
wasn't no Concept lock, man!

1367
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:33,968
You ain't tell me about this
motherfucker up here either!

1368
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:36,276
- What the fuck does it matter
if it's a Concept lock, like...

1369
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,350
- Artie's Locksmith, that's
probably the only motherfucker

1370
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:39,797
that can open that motherfucker
right there:

1371
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:41,806
24-hour service.

1372
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:42,894
Not me, man.

1373
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:45,138
This right here is-is-
I can't-

1374
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:46,418
I can't do it, man.

1375
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:48,080
This shit right here is-

1376
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,802
You can't do it, for real?

1377
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:54,067
- I could do it, man.
I just need enough time, man.

1378
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:25,485
# Tonight

1379
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:30,259
# Tonight I feel cold inside

1380
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:32,529
# Tonight

1381
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:37,714
# Tonight I want you
by my side

1382
00:54:37,748 --> 00:54:39,536
# Tell me what to do

1383
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:42,354
# Tell me what to do
to feel better

1384
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:46,796
# Tell me what to do

1385
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:49,519
# Tell me what to do
to feel warmer

1386
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,963
# The night

1387
00:54:54,995 --> 00:54:58,029
# It makes me feel strange
tonight #

1388
00:55:11,027 --> 00:55:13,198
- Yo, what up?
Where is she?

1389
00:55:13,235 --> 00:55:15,209
- She-
she's coming back.

1390
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:16,199
Fuck!

1391
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:17,518
And I think she made me.

1392
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:18,863
- Made you?
Made you do what?

1393
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,680
- Made me.
Like, she-she saw me.

1394
00:55:21,714 --> 00:55:22,990
- Look, I don't think it works
like that.

1395
00:55:23,026 --> 00:55:24,138
She doesn't even know
who you are.

1396
00:55:24,178 --> 00:55:25,225
That's not the point.

1397
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:27,055
- Fuck that.
Don't let her come.

1398
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,334
Like, you have to stop her.

1399
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:30,508
- All right.
All right!

1400
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,057
Yo, excuse me.

1401
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:43,112
What?

1402
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:44,233
Um...

1403
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:47,788
Um...

1404
00:55:52,177 --> 00:55:53,835
What?

1405
00:55:55,089 --> 00:55:56,038
My bad.

1406
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:57,739
Um...

1407
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,494
Hello?

1408
00:56:23,536 --> 00:56:24,484
Yo, Malcolm.

1409
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,542
What's up?

1410
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,892
I lost her.

1411
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:27,854
Ugh!

1412
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:28,814
Did you get in?

1413
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:29,774
Uh, hold on.

1414
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:30,984
Malcolm, don't put me on-

1415
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:33,706
- Ma, Ma,
I can't talk right now.

1416
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:36,558
Yeah, I'm sorry.
A'ight, I gotta go, bye.

1417
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:37,835
Hello?
- Malcolm.

1418
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:39,115
- What the fuck?
What happened?

1419
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,038
- What the fuck-
what do you mean, what happened?

1420
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,175
I fuckin' told you.
I lost her.

1421
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:44,491
Fuck!

1422
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:48,205
Yo, we gotta hurry up.

1423
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:49,580
- Hey, what's the problem,
man?

1424
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,956
Listen, she's-

1425
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,397
Nigga, she on her way back,
like, now.

1426
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,667
Like, we gotta
fucking hurry up.

1427
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,190
This fucking shit, man.

1428
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,245
I'm a professional, man.

1429
00:56:58,286 --> 00:56:59,464
That's not how I do things,
man.

1430
00:56:59,502 --> 00:57:00,746
Come on.
Let's bounce.

1431
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:02,821
We gotta get the fuck
up out of here, man, but...

1432
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,268
What the fuck, man?

1433
00:57:04,302 --> 00:57:05,862
- You gotta step
your game up, man.

1434
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:07,811
Come on. Let's get the fuck
up out of here, man.

1435
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:12,964
- Yo.
- Hey.

1436
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,517
So where she at?

1437
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:17,866
She on the roof.

1438
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,308
- How the fuck you know
she on the roof?

1439
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:20,868
- 'Cause I followed her
in her building,

1440
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,316
and she went up to R.

1441
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:24,869
Where the fuck you been at?

1442
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,883
- Oh, you know, I was just
getting my nails done.

1443
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:27,972
What the fuck you think?

1444
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:29,474
I was running
like a fucking track star

1445
00:57:29,517 --> 00:57:30,761
trying to get down here,
Malcolm.

1446
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:32,203
- Oh, you can't keep up
with the white girls?

1447
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:34,244
- Shut the fuck up.
I don't know this fucking area.

1448
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:42,697
The fuck is she doing?

1449
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:45,252
- Oh, shit,
this bitch is going in?

1450
00:57:46,411 --> 00:57:48,746
That's the ghetto
swimming pool.

1451
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:50,667
- Let's go grab
her fucking keys.

1452
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:51,648
You crazy?

1453
00:57:51,692 --> 00:57:53,099
Gonna take us, like,
ten minutes to get up there.

1454
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,178
She not gonna be in there
that long.

1455
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,456
I'm telling you,
that shit is crazy cold.

1456
00:57:56,492 --> 00:57:57,474
Crazy cold.

1457
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,889
How you know?

1458
00:57:58,924 --> 00:58:01,160
- Listen, I know all about
the ghetto swimming pool, Sofia.

1459
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:02,439
I'm a ghetto swimming pool
master.

1460
00:58:02,475 --> 00:58:04,362
- You don't know nothin' about
no damn ghetto swimming pool.

1461
00:58:04,395 --> 00:58:05,889
- For real, man,
that shit is dangerous, yo.

1462
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:07,654
Did she eat or drink anything?
Like...

1463
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah.

1464
00:58:09,034 --> 00:58:10,528
Yeah?

1465
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,480
- No.
I don't fucking know.

1466
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:13,732
I'm tired.
I'm hungry.

1467
00:58:13,771 --> 00:58:15,145
My feet fuckin' hurt
from running.

1468
00:58:15,179 --> 00:58:16,389
I got to pee.

1469
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,721
You not asking me
if I ate or drank anything.

1470
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:23,267
- Yeah, but you're you,
and she's, you know...

1471
00:58:23,306 --> 00:58:25,892
- She's what?
Pretty?

1472
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:28,832
Yeah, she's pretty.

1473
00:58:28,874 --> 00:58:30,946
Interesting.

1474
00:58:30,986 --> 00:58:32,546
Exciting.

1475
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,146
Fun.

1476
00:58:34,186 --> 00:58:36,706
You know?

1477
00:58:36,745 --> 00:58:38,306
But, yo,
that ain't even my type, though.

1478
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:40,549
I don't even like chicks
like that, man.

1479
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:42,309
- You said you was in love
with her, Malcolm,

1480
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:45,214
so, you know,
it is what it is.

1481
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,818
- You know
I just be talking my shit.

1482
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,224
Like, just-

1483
00:58:49,257 --> 00:58:52,104
You know I'm more into girls
like-you know, like you.

1484
00:58:52,136 --> 00:58:53,118
Like me?

1485
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:54,535
Like what,
some weird-looking bitch

1486
00:58:54,568 --> 00:58:56,161
that, like, isn't pretty,
that isn't fly,

1487
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,088
that doesn't climb
into fucking water towers?

1488
00:58:58,121 --> 00:58:59,364
- No, I didn't mean it
like that.

1489
00:58:59,401 --> 00:59:01,441
I'm just saying I like girls
that are more, like,

1490
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,658
you know, tough.

1491
00:59:02,696 --> 00:59:03,841
Tough?

1492
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,604
What,
tough like a fucking dyke?

1493
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,989
- No, Sofia.
Yo, listen.

1494
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:11,072
You know-you know, I think
you're fine as hell.

1495
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:12,356
Like, I'm-I'm mad you even

1496
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,301
making me tell you this
right now, like...

1497
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:19,518
I was just trying to make you
feel better, man, a'ight?

1498
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,429
I know I piss you off
all the time.

1499
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:24,576
But, you know,
that's just me.

1500
00:59:24,616 --> 00:59:26,525
You know, I just be trying to-
I don't be trying-

1501
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,477
Shut the fuck up, Malcolm.

1502
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:31,294
I know what the fuck you mean,

1503
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,830
like when you be fucking
with somebody,

1504
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,115
trying to make them feel better,

1505
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:36,355
but instead you make them feel,
like, ten times worse,

1506
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,405
so it's cool.

1507
00:59:37,447 --> 00:59:38,396
Yeah, man.

1508
00:59:38,439 --> 00:59:39,519
Like my mom,
she used to think

1509
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:40,803
that I was scared of flying,

1510
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:42,660
so she would tell me, like,
I have higher chances

1511
00:59:42,695 --> 00:59:45,215
of dying in a car crash
than in a plane crash.

1512
00:59:45,254 --> 00:59:46,661
And I'm just like,
"What the fuck?"

1513
00:59:46,695 --> 00:59:49,564
Like, now I'm scared
to ride in cars now.

1514
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:51,264
Yeah, like that.

1515
00:59:51,302 --> 00:59:54,019
- Man...
Or like wet dreams.

1516
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:55,264
- Wet dreams, Malcolm?
Really?

1517
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:56,546
What the fuck?

1518
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:58,175
- No, like they always
telling us in phys ed.

1519
00:59:58,214 --> 00:59:59,294
They always telling us, like,

1520
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,762
it's normal to have wet dreams,
right?

1521
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,180
But, like,
I don't have wet dreams.

1522
01:00:02,213 --> 01:00:03,969
Like, I don't come in my shorts
in the middle of the night.

1523
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:05,412
But all my parts work,
but, like-I don't know.

1524
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:06,590
Maybe something's wrong
with me.

1525
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:08,702
- That's disgusting.
- I know, yo.

1526
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:10,563
- No, I'm saying
you're fuckin' disgusting.

1527
01:00:10,597 --> 01:00:12,190
You don't say that shit
to a lady.

1528
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:14,116
- Oh, now you a lady and shit?
Please.

1529
01:00:14,149 --> 01:00:15,131
Yes, I am a fucking lady.

1530
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:16,188
And, what, you think

1531
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,952
you gonna get that white bitch
talking about,

1532
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,679
"I don't come all wild
in my shorts at night"?

1533
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:21,091
- I mean,
I don't come in my shorts,

1534
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,718
so, I mean, that's a benefit,
if anything.

1535
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:23,772
A benefit?

1536
01:00:23,813 --> 01:00:24,827
Look, my fucking point is,

1537
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:26,298
you don't say that shit
to a female.

1538
01:00:26,341 --> 01:00:28,348
It's manners.
You're mad disrespectful.

1539
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,223
All right, man.

1540
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,275
You gonna be all right.

1541
01:00:33,316 --> 01:00:34,811
- Don't touch my hand,
Malcolm.

1542
01:00:34,852 --> 01:00:36,193
- I'll touch your hand
if I want to.

1543
01:00:36,228 --> 01:00:37,821
Don't fucking touch my hand.

1544
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:42,109
Nigga, you soft.

1545
01:00:42,148 --> 01:00:43,609
- You ain't so tough after all
either.

1546
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:45,375
- I don't know
what you talking about.

1547
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:47,200
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1548
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:07,230
- Yo, she's been up there
for a minute.

1549
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:08,860
She has been.

1550
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,416
I don't know.

1551
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,539
The water level
isn't always that-

1552
01:01:12,579 --> 01:01:13,823
it ain't always high,

1553
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:16,793
and that ladder don't go
all the way to the bottom.

1554
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:33,985
- Yo, I'm telling you,
this bitch is fuckin' dead.

1555
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:35,261
Hey, don't say that shit, man.

1556
01:01:35,297 --> 01:01:36,956
- What you mean,
don't fucking say that shit?

1557
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,848
That bitch is-
she's fucking dead.

1558
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:40,823
- Nah, maybe she got out
when we was talking and shit.

1559
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,207
She didn't fucking get out.

1560
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:43,703
That's gonna fuck up
they water system.

1561
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:45,785
Little fuckin' bitty pieces
of flesh

1562
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:47,036
all cut up
all in they water.

1563
01:01:47,073 --> 01:01:48,382
- Yo, that's not fucking cool,
yo.

1564
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:49,529
Don't say that shit.

1565
01:01:49,569 --> 01:01:51,063
- Don't tell me
what's not fucking cool.

1566
01:01:51,105 --> 01:01:52,217
I'm telling you-

1567
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:57,148
- A'ight, man.
Fuck.

1568
01:01:57,185 --> 01:01:59,519
Nobody ever gonna find her.

1569
01:02:03,616 --> 01:02:05,655
# Oh, the Lord
is my shepherd

1570
01:02:05,696 --> 01:02:09,143
# The Lord is my shepherd

1571
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,558
# I shall

1572
01:02:10,591 --> 01:02:13,591
# I shall not want

1573
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:19,259
# He maketh me

1574
01:02:19,295 --> 01:02:20,888
# Lie down

1575
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:24,310
# Lie down in green pastures

1576
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:29,491
# He leadeth me

1577
01:02:29,535 --> 01:02:31,061
# Beside

1578
01:02:31,102 --> 01:02:34,136
# Beside still waters

1579
01:02:34,175 --> 01:02:36,542
# He restoreth

1580
01:02:36,575 --> 01:02:39,608
# Restoreth my soul

1581
01:02:39,646 --> 01:02:41,337
# I know He

1582
01:02:41,374 --> 01:02:44,440
# He restoreth my soul

1583
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,854
# He leadeth me

1584
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:52,275
# In the paths,
oh, yeah

1585
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:54,904
# In the paths

1586
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:59,863
# Whoa, of righteousness,
yeah, Lord, yeah

1587
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,421
# Whoa, righteousness

1588
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:06,582
# For Your name's sake

1589
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:09,850
# For His name's sake

1590
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:11,827
# I know for His

1591
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:14,553
# For His name's sake

1592
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:19,931
# Yet though I walk

1593
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,299
# I've got to walk
through the valley

1594
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:25,147
# Through the valley

01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:17,013
# Say it
just a little louder #

1613
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:19,318
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pedro.

1614
01:04:19,354 --> 01:04:21,842
We got it.
We got it. We got it.

1615
01:04:21,882 --> 01:04:24,981
A'ight, so we'll meet you at
the stadium tomorrow morning.

1616
01:04:25,018 --> 01:04:26,993
All right.

1617
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:30,737
You think it's gonna work?

1618
01:04:30,778 --> 01:04:32,818
- Yeah, all you gotta do
is put a dollar on the top,

1619
01:04:32,858 --> 01:04:34,865
put a dollar on the bottom,
cut up some newspaper,

1620
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:35,985
put it in between.

1621
01:04:36,025 --> 01:04:37,967
That shit'll look legit.

1622
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,122
A'ight.

Yo, he having a party?

1624
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,841
- I don't know.
Something like that.

1625
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,091
I don't even know.

1626
01:04:52,824 --> 01:04:54,384
Oh, well, look who it is.

1627
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:55,919
If it isn't my favorite bitch.

1628
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,520
- Yo, chill the fuck out, yo.
- Oh, shit, yo.

1629
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,837

1630
01:04:58,873 --> 01:05:00,782
I'm only kidding, man.

1631
01:05:00,824 --> 01:05:02,547
- A'ight, a'ight, you got it.
You got it.

1632
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:04,111
You got it.

01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:22,867
# Roll it up, light it up,
pass that

1634
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:28,718
# Roll it up, light it up,
pass that

1635
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,068
# Hit the bud

1636
01:05:32,279 --> 01:05:33,359
# Hit it

1637
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:37,526
# I found a way to heat up
in a cold world

1638
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,802
# I told a girl,
put her feet up

1639
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:40,246
# Let her toes curl

1640
01:05:40,278 --> 01:05:42,799
# Oh, girl needed pleasure
through the pain struggle

1641
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:45,970
# Never approach the game
as if the game loves you

1642
01:05:46,006 --> 01:05:47,730
# But the game loves you #

1643
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,612
- Yo, good-looking
on the sneakers, man.

1644
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,173
I been walking around

1645
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,931
- You know I got you, man.
Come on.

1646
01:06:02,134 --> 01:06:05,298
Yo, what's good
with you and-you and Sof, man?

1647
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,472
You trying to bag that
or what?

1648
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:09,680
- Nah, nah, that's my partner
and shit, you know?

1649
01:06:09,718 --> 01:06:12,717
- You sure? 'Cause y'all seem
real close, man.

1650
01:06:12,757 --> 01:06:14,862
Nah, nah, nah, we-

1651

1652
01:06:16,469 --> 01:06:18,062
I'm gonna make my move tonight.

1653
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:21,068
- Nah, nah, you good.
You good. You good.

1654
01:06:22,293 --> 01:06:24,016
I'm good?

1655
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:25,460
I see.
I see.

1656
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:26,572
Man, do your thing, man.

1657
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:27,856
You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

1658
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:30,161
I got you, man.
You're my boy, yo.

1659
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:26,318
- So your boy Pedro
is good for it, huh?

1660
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,604
# I am blessed

1661
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,029

# Jesus #

1672
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:25,515
- I'm telling you,
fuck that guy, yo.

1673
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,438
Yo, he fucked us up,
I'm telling you.

1674
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:28,780
And, look, I need your help

1675
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,407
in this situation downtown
I got going on.

1676
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:31,592
I got into some shit,

1677
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:33,224
so I need your help
in smoothing it out.

1678
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,391
What?

1679
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:38,635
Fuck, man.

1680
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,230
Are you serious?

1681
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:41,831
Damn!

1682
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:43,692
All right, all right,

1683
01:08:43,726 --> 01:08:45,100
I'll make it up to her,
all right, man?

1684
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,501
All right, I gotta go.

1685
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:50,829
Yo, I fucking missed
my mom's birthday, yo.

1686
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:52,869
- What you mean, you missed
your mom's birthday?

1687
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:55,431
You mad ungrateful.

1688
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:05,189
Yo.

1689
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:06,309
Fuck that shit, yo.

1690
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,033
I gotta get some flowers for her
at least.

1691
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:10,662
A'ight.

1692
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:18,665
Hey.

1693
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:19,780
Hi, papi.

1694
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:21,959
Um, your flowers
are absolutely beautiful,

1695
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:24,996
but what kind of plant
is this right here?

1696
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:26,662
This is snake plant.

1697
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:27,944
Snake plant, right?

1698
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,729
So is it gonna get big
or stay small?

1699
01:09:30,764 --> 01:09:32,902
So big?
Oh, okay, no problem.

1700
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,020
They're beautiful.

1701
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,481
I was just curious,
but thank you.

1702
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,405
That shit was kind of fun.

1703
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:51,556
Yeah.

1704
01:09:53,483 --> 01:09:55,239
You did good.

1705
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:05,445
Nah, give 'em all
to your mom.

1706
01:10:05,482 --> 01:10:06,889
It's her birthday and all.

1707
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:08,679
A'ight.

1708
01:10:17,098 --> 01:10:19,967
- All right, well,
I'll catch you later.

1709
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:41,160
# Any day now

1710
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:44,902

# They say
that every distance

1713
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,040
# Is not near

1714
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,404
# Ooh

1715
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,880
# But I can remember, yeah

1716

# Everything

1717
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:15,871
# Ooh

1718
01:11:15,911 --> 01:11:18,759
# On the face
of the people

1719
