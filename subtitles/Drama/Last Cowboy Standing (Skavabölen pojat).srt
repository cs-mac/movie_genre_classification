1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,238
We came to get you.
You're not allowed on the tracks.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,548
Please... Go.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,360
How could they...

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,154
Come on.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,195
Come!

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,795
Use Karate!

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,230
Go then! But Evert and I are coming too!

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,589
No, we're not!

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,873
Evert is going to die too.
- No!

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,429
Rupert, don't!

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,350
Rosenqvist will call the police.
We'll all end up in jail.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,429
Stop it.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,596
Rupert! Don't...

14
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,755
Come away from there.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,318
Promise you won't do that ever again.
Or anything else.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,192
I promise.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,679
I won't.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,992
You behave yourself now.

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,235
I feel faint.
- Have something hot to drink.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,559
We can make you food.
Rainbow cake.

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,757
If you're tired we can clean up.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,396
And we have
a Sugar Baby Love show, too.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,471
Yeah. Evert.

24
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,193
Something happened in court.
That's why she was crazy.

25
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,075
Damned ostrick.

26
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,512
Ostrich! Learn to speak.

27
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,151
You're moving to Hym-Hym Hyrylä.

28
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,278
The court decided so.

29
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,956
What's happened to this?

30
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,954
It's gum. A food storage.
It belongs behind the toilet bowl!

31
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,750
It'll get hair all over it, shitwig!

32
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,751
Go. It'll be like an adventure.

33
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,070
Ok, let's go.

34
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,994
You say goodbye to Mom, too.

35
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,432
I'm not going if Mom's not coming.

36
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,352
Let go.

37
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,909
Are you going on a trip?

38
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,515
We're moving.

39
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,109
You lied. I hate you.

40
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,792
Where to?
- Some place called Hyrylä.

41
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,879
It's Skavaböle in Swedish.
I know even though I'm younger.

42
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,715
Is Evert moving too?

43
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,797
For me? You're giving it to me?

44
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,749
Time to leave the ladies
waving on the shore.

45
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,952
Will you ever come back?

46
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,079
I'm glad you're moving, retard.

47
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,073
Double retard.
- Shitstick.

48
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,829
Dearrest, rratarrse Rebecca Rosenqvist.
Bye.

49
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,756
Shitshoes!

50
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,235
"Don't show this to Rebecca.

51
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,870
Hi Lotta. I think you're pretty cute
or I mean beautiful.

52
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,669
There's no one prettier in the world.
I love you.

53
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,752
Don't call me a retard cause I'm not.

54
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,918
Yours truly, Evert Kallio."

55
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,678
Hyrylä is the center of Tuusula.
The writer Aleksis Kivi came to die there.

56
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,557
Composers, artists, sculptors... culture.

57
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,593
Hands up, outlaws!

58
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,117
What? Look, Hannes. A young faggot.

59
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,988
My name is Evert Kallio. What's yours?
- What the fuck's it to you, Bonanza.

60
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,113
Do it Keke, fart in his face!

61
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,039
Say you're sorry
that you look like a prick.

62
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,952
I'm sorry I look like a prick.

63
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,430
Stop! That's my brother.

64
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,110
Say you're sorry
that you look like a prick.

65
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,073
I'm sorry I look like a prick.
- Twice.

66
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,635
I'm sorry I look like a prick.
- Louder!

67
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,593
I'm sorry I look like a prick!

68
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,312
We have to go home for lunch.

69
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,193
Ta-dah!

70
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,518
Guess who just came in, Anneli?

71
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,514
Elvis and Aaron Presley?

72
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,789
Mister Rupert and Mister Evert.

73
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,788
You made something nice for us again?

74
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,917
Could it be chicken?

75
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,076
We should call Mom.

76
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,908
Do you like Dajm bars?

77
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,275
That reminds me, enjoy your chocolate-

78
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,508
and listen to this.

79
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,468
Slade!
Does it have "Cum On Feel The Noize"?

80
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,793
Took me forever to find it.

81
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,670
Are they as good as Dad's favorite, Elvis?

82
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,639
Let's set up a disco, boys!

83
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,792
Anneli, come and disco with us!

84
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm going to call Mom.
You can't even dance.

85
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,513
Let's keep the phone bill down.

86
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,990
I'm starving...

87
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,398
Highly agitated... illogical speech...
manic psychosis...

88
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,231
Dangerous to others...
Signed: Ossi Kallio.

89
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,839
You're a real gentleman.

90
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,631
Head of the Board of Commerce.

91
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,555
Head of administration
at the National Board of Commerce.

92
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,511
Attorney. Inactive reserve...

93
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,719
Any Johnny Walker left?

94
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,789
Who's that?

95
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,394
Rupe, come meet the pearl of Hyrylä.

96
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,552
This is Tamara.
A dear friend of the Magician.

97
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,192
Was in a pageant, even.
- Blah. Miss Denim Finland.

98
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,072
Boy, how young you look.

99
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,158
Porcelain pop prince.

100
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,835
Did you steal my bottle?

101
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,555
I've had enough! Get out!

102
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,951
Did you find it?
- What?

103
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,397
Johnny Walker!

104
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,757
Where could it be... we just bought it.

105
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,437
The boys have hidden it.

106
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,951
Have you noticed you have
a jetty in your attic?

107
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,678
Don't you dare sell that!
It's a surprise for the boys.

108
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,992
Maybe I could sell these sugars...

109
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,508
From cafeterias.

110
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,715
I grab a few whenever I stop
some place for coffee.

111
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,317
There're some nice ones from abroad.

112
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,993
We could buy some yeast,
make some homebrew!

113
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,838
My bag...

114
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,229
How did that get in there...?

115
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,713
Why are you looking
at me like that, Rupert?

116
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,189
You don't think the Magician
came here to steal?

117
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,631
From the war.

118
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,591
Shrapnel?

119
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,230
Bullet.

120
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,832
I didn't kill anyone else.

121
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,468
He was my age.

122
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,396
Shot me in the throat.

123
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,834
When I went back in the morning...

124
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,078
Did Pekka doze off?

125
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,756
Pekka!

126
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,078
They're building tenements on Ilpo's farm-

127
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,997
he's selling everything for a pittance!

128
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,958
Why isn't Rupert speaking?

129
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,908
Hasn't said a word to me all week.
The silent treatment?

130
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,278
Rupert, what are you staring at?

131
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,470
You won't let him call. We were
supposed to see Mom this weekend.

132
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,395
It's only to help you adjust.
You'll see her later.

133
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,311
Evert, come here.

134
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,679
You wanna hear a secret?
Even Anneli doesn't know this.

135
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,193
I'm retired now. My spine is bent.

136
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,909
Ten years and it'll be like a barrel.

137
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,558
A rolling man gathers no moss.

138
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,311
They gave me a party at work,
cake, coffee, champagne and all.

139
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,158
The girls kissed me and the director
gave a speech.

140
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,233
It was shit, but who cares.

141
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,352
They gave me a nice vase with roses in it.

142
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,394
I threw the roses out
and put the sugars in.

143
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,834
Look, Evert.
We'll plant a mountain pine over there.

144
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,475
On that mound there.
It'll be real pretty.

145
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,875
You could even drop an urn there.

146
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,274
Don't tell Rupert.

147
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,356
Argh, I'm going to start crying again.

148
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,992
Anneli got a job in Germany as a diplomat.

149
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,870
Don't put on too much weight.

150
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,878
We stayed home to keep Dad company.

151
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,040
Well, well...

152
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,278
We didn't see Mom all winter.

153
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,069
Dad said she was ill or traveling-

154
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,392
and finally we were told
she didn't want to see us.

155
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,994
And we still weren't allowed
to use the phone.

156
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,552
Come.

157
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,112
Come and see!

158
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,952
What?

159
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,596
Do I look dreadful?

160
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,115
Does Pekka know about this?

161
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,829
They're my children.

162
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,759
Help, are they here already?

163
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,909
The door was open.

164
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,635
Father Kinnunen.
Just call me the Magician.

165
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,553
I sell carpets.
- We're not buying.

166
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,190
Kallio...
I knew an Eero Kallio during the war.

167
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,396
Medical captain. Any relation?

168
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,757
Yes, on my ex-husband's side.

169
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,239
But he doesn't live here anymore.
He moved to Hyrylä.

170
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,275
I don't need a carpet.

171
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,395
It's good to have something to stand on.

172
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,439
Boys, I got that nice Sugar Baby Love
record for you.

173
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,399
You could do your act later?
- Yeah!

174
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,873
I made you a train cake.

175
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,356
Are you hurt?

176
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,158
I can't do this.
- Sure you can. Just get up.

177
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,997
The little shits come in their
fancy cab to mess with me.

178
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,708
Pirjo?
- And you, you...

179
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,355
Go have some brewskies with Ossi!

180
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,154
Go to hell, all of you!

181
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,389
You crazy bitch!

182
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,711
That spring Dad worried about Evert.
His testicles wouldn't drop.

183
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,597
And I went to specialists,
he thought I had trouble with my eyes.

184
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,912
We wondered why Dad sometimes
smelled like Mom's perfume.

185
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,035
Rupert!
Come and shoot!

186
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,151
You can be Kaj Pahlman,
the banana kick man!

187
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,795
Notorious Kaj Pahlman
comes to take the penalty shot.

188
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,989
Up against Lev Yashin, the Black Spider.

189
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,391
What? Protest!

190
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,279
Pahlman threw a banana peel
at Yashin's feet!

191
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,758
He can't stay up!

192
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,231
What's going on?

193
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,755
From Anneli.

194
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,071
Hot damn, she's bought
you guys Lederhosen!

195
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,552
Now we'll practice some German
leather pants slap dance.

196
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,277
Joe's barn!

197
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,274
Jack Ass speaking.

198
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,599
Rupert...?

199
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,754
It's Mom...

200
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,079
Bumsky, come!

201
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,911
Why's your head so small, Jesus?

202
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,757
I don't want to go on.

203
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,719
Let's stop it right here.

204
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,991
I have to keep going.
I have bled all my blood.

205
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,636
Drip drip drip.
Have mercy, my Lord!

206
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,955
Bullet straight into the heart!
Luckily the sheriff's star stopped it.

207
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,316
Thank you, Jesus!

208
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,348
The fortress! Finally!
My mission is fulfilled.

209
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,399
That dinner hit the spot.
The fresh air sure makes you sleepy.

210
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,239
Now this mama is going to sleep.

211
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,669
My God! A man crawling in the desert!
It's my son, Black Leopard!

212
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,753
Here is the message
that will save the fortress!

213
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,590
My son! You died a hero's death!
Valiant Black Leopard!

214
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,350
This message will save the fortress
at its moment of despair!

215
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,156
Bravo! What a captivating performance!

216
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,633
Your death was very touching.

217
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,638
Auntie Hippa even shed a tear.

218
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,718
And it took him only half an hour.

219
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,475
Where's Anu?

220
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,678
She's resting.

221
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,753
Who all took part?

222
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,314
Bah. We did all the parts.
I was also Hoppalongheis and the Indian.

223
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,076
Evert tried to be Frank the Avenger,
and the barman...

224
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,839
At the funeral.

225
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,674
Whose?
- Your Mom's.

226
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,753
Was it a beautiful funeral?

227
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,238
Whose?

228
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,069
You didn't tell them?

229
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,517
Is she dead?

230
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,552
How did she die?

231
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,629
Heart attack.

232
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,953
When people die what age
are they in heaven?

233
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,916
Are they babies or old geezers or what?

234
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,116
Dunno.

235
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,909
Tell me a story.

236
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,395
But not Grimm.

237
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,676
Remember when we slept over
at Auntie Hippa's place?

238
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,228
The ceiling was made of boards.

239
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,915
Wasn't it?

240
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,792
Some sap kept running out of a knothole.

241
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,551
It looked like the ceiling was crying.

242
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,949
I said: "Don't cry ceiling,
ceiling don't cry".

243
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,389
Don't you, either.

244
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,351
Rupe. Can't you sleep?

245
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,399
Bring me some water?

246
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,351
Help me out.

247
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,275
We have to hide this.

248
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,317
We should call the clinic
and tell them to fetch him.

249
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,879
That's the stairway you're pissing in!

250
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,788
He's going crazy or something.

251
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,719
Then at least we'll get rid of him.

252
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,714
Rupe! You seen my Johnny Walker?
- You looking for a place to shit?

253
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,311
Yeah right.

254
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,993
Stop kidding, boys. Give it to me.

255
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,190
You want money?

256
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,039
I lost my wallet.

257
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,358
I kinda need some covers
for my schoolbooks.

258
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,871
Did that flathead ape take it?

259
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,712
Evert, why don't you kill yourself?
It disgusts me to look at you.

260
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,159
You found it.

261
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,512
Little dormouse, come here.
- Don't go.

262
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,913
I just want to talk.

263
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,751
You're a repulsive, disgusting child.

264
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,473
Don't! Sicko!

265
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,520
You stop, I stop.

266
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,113
It was no heart attack.

267
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,071
What?

268
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,956
Mom.

269
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,552
Your mother was very sensitive.

270
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,318
It was an accident.

271
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,677
You shut her in a mental hospital.
With Ossi's help.

272
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,159
You took us away.

273
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,437
Same as if you had killed her.

274
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,314
I loved your Mom!

275
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,514
And I loved you!

276
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,830
Hit me.

277
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,635
Hit me!

278
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,957
I'd get to make you happy for once.

279
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,075
Hug me then.

280
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,475
I won't let you hit Dad!

281
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,075
That's my gun. Stop playing with it.

282
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,991
Seems you take after your Dad.

283
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,074
Maybe I do.

284
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,960
You won't become like me.
You take after your mother.

285
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,995
I won't become anything.

286
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,871
Could someone shave my beard?

287
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,877
My clothes need changing.

288
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,435
Boys, you wanna go to the lake
and find a place for the jetty?

289
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,589
Boys!

290
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,353
Which party?

291
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,357
Pekka Kallio. Which party are you with?

292
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,318
Lasse's in trouble.

293
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,712
Here comes Putteman
at a dangerous speed!

294
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,116
Wow.

295
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,353
Easter witches.

296
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,279
Sure you can!

297
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,351
Aren't you going to answer?

298
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,676
Who's calling?

299
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,716
I am.

300
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,671
Boys!

301
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,471
Evert?

302
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,397
Wake up.

303
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,756
Lemme sleep, damnit.

304
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,279
I think your father is dead.

305
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,319
He's not getting out of bed.

306
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,715
He's not breathing.

307
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,354
A fine person, your Dad.

308
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,671
Evert...

309
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,359
If you see someone punch me-

310
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,430
you punch me, too.

311
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,030
You wanna go to Kurre's Bar?

312
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,914
Let's walk. Past Koivuhovi.

313
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,071
Get some color on your cheeks.

314
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,270
You're so pale.

315
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,998
Hurry up, so we'll have time
to get loaded.

316
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,794
Quick! The train is coming.
- Is my hair ok?

317
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,471
What?

318
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,198
Do I look pretty?
- Why...?

319
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,790
Give my love to the boys. And kisses.

320
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,278
I'm sorry.

321
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,069
Pirjo! Don't!

322
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,749
Distinguished public official,
long career in administration...

323
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,070
Father of two sons.

324
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,479
Sociable, well-loved...
Yep, and we'll keep it short.

325
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,830
I think that should be all.

326
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,639
Ok if I stay for a while?

327
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,313
I'd like to have a moment
alone with my Dad.

328
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,590
Of course.

329
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,798
Rupert.

330
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,319
How are you holding up?

331
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,758
Where's Evert?
- He left.

332
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,118
Said it wasn't Dad being buried.
- He's right.

333
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,397
Pekka is in another place already.

334
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,390
Rupert.

335
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,832
I have some of your father's old stocks.

336
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,475
Evert needs some covers
for his schoolbooks.

337
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,758
You don't know how much
I've thought of you.

338
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,793
Don't sneer at the Magician.

339
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,196
Nothing dies.

340
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,955
Nothing ever dies.

341
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,674
You lay it.

342
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,150
Thank you, Rupert.

343
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,194
Good night, sleep tight,
kissy kiss, buggy bug-

344
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,791
night night, et cetera et cetera.

345
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,750
You didn't come to the funeral.
- Did you have a good time?

346
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,918
We could make some coffee.

347
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,028
But there's no sugar.

348
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,518
Someone took Dad's sugar collection.

349
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,989
Anneli, maybe?

350
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,799
You shouldn't lie.

351
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,032
Don't you want to be my brother anymore?

352
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,635
One can't lie.
Or die before the other.

353
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,673
Or leave the other in trouble.

354
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,038
I guess I'll have to go live
with Anu and Ossi.

355
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,078
What are you going to do?
Will you stay here?

356
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,674
Where will you go?

357
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,672
To find a place for the jetty.

358
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,713
Will you ever come back?

359
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,233
I'll crawl through the desert-

360
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,796
and deliver a secret message
that will save the fortress.

361
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,878
And even Jesus will cry.

362
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,910
I wish something happened.
