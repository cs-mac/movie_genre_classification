1
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:15,732
Fair eastside

2
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,735
by thy side
we'll stand

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,740
and always
praise thy name

4
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:29,746
and ever lend our hearts
and hands

5
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:34,250
to help increase thy fame

6
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:40,256
the honor
of old eastside high

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,261
brings forth our loyalty

8
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:50,767
so cheer
for dear old eastside high

9
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:55,271
lead on to victory

10
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,774
man: As the tension mounts
throughout the free world,

11
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,777
the ladies have a surprising
15-0 lead over the boys.

12
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:04,280
Now next question,
bonus question for 20 points.

13
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:09,285
What is the origin
of our civil rights?

14
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:11,788
The magna carta.

15
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:13,790
No, tom, no.

16
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:15,291
Ellen, take it.

17
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:16,793
English common law.

18
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:18,294
20-point bonus.

19
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,297
Boys lose 10 points
for ringing the bell

20
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,800
without knowing the answer.
It's a 10-point loss.

21
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,302
The magna carta was a document
guaranteeing rights,

22
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,304
but the rights of whom?
Uh, stacey.

23
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,806
The aristocracy.

24
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,308
10-point bonus
for the girls.

25
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:35,311
The aristocracy
vis-a-vis the king.

26
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,815
The people got their rights
from the common well.

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,818
The common well.
Hence... come on, who knows?

28
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,319
Uh... anthony.

29
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,320
Commonwealth?

30
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,823
10-point bonus
for the boys.

31
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:48,825
Good, but, guys,
watch out.

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,329
Girls have a 45-0 lead.
You're not doing too well.

33
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,331
Next two.
Come on. Quickly.

34
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,333
All right.
Here we go.

35
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,335
Bonus question
for 10 points.

36
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,838
Define the word
"imbrue."

37
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:04,340
Aha. I'll spell it
for you.

38
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:09,345
L-m-b-r-u-e.
Imbrue.

39
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,851
Mr. Clark, could your class
spare you for a minute?

40
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,353
Surely. Kids,
take your seats. Quickly.

41
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,855
Come on. Quickly.

42
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,858
Take out your pencils.
Write this down.

43
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:28,364
Imbrue-to taint,
to stain.

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:32,368
The cancer of racism

45
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:36,372
imbrues our national
character.

46
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:40,877
It stains the spirit,

47
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,879
taints the soul.

48
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,883
It is a blot,

49
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:50,386
a shameful, greasy spot

50
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,389
on the fabric
of our national conscience.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,395
Imbrue-to taint,
to stain.

52
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,399
30 words tomorrow.
Test.

53
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,404
What's the matter?

54
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,906
They're holding
a meeting

55
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,407
of the union
executive board.

56
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,909
Without us?

57
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,911
They didn't
tell me, either.

58
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,913
I told you we couldn't
trust them.

59
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,414
Keep it down.

60
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,416
Those no-good bastards
sell us out-

61
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,418
out of a union we started?

62
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,420
Betray us like
a bunch of judases?

63
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,923
They won't crucify me.

64
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,926
No, sir. I got
the hammer and nails.

65
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,428
I won't be anybody's
martyr, frank.

66
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,430
I'm sick and tired
of spineless jellyfish.

67
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,432
Save it
for the meeting.

68
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,434
Why, man?
I got plenty.

69
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:40,436
I'm the rockefeller
of outrage.

70
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,439
What the hell are
you people doing?

71
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:44,941
We're having a meeting.

72
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,943
You're
selling us out.

73
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,445
We cannot have
an effective voice.

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,447
Our curriculum will
be impotent

75
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,450
if we sell out every
time they threaten us.

76
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,953
You want to talk,
about this, call me in

77
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,955
we have
to stick together.

78
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,957
What we have to do
is pay our bills.

79
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,959
You want to carry
picket signs.

80
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,961
We just want to work.

81
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,963
We're tired
of the agitation,

82
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,965
the posturing
of crazy-

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,967
how can you talk
about posturing

84
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,469
when you're always
bent over

85
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,972
kissing posteriors
at the school board?

86
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,974
You want to
step outside?

87
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:19,976
If you had any nerve
at all,

88
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:21,978
you'd be fighting
on my side.

89
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,980
Mr. Clark, i'm afraid
that's a moot point.

90
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,483
We just found out
that the board of education

91
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,485
will grant
our salary increments

92
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,487
if we agree
to accept their condition

93
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,490
that you be transferred
to school 6,

94
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,993
and we agreed.

95
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:44,500
God bless you, man.

96
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,503
Pay your bills.

97
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:52,508
Joe.

98
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,510
They can go to hell.

99
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,012
Come on, joe.

100
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,015
This place deserves
exactly what it gets.

101
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,531
Welcome to the jungle

102
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,533
we got fun and games

103
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:52,535
we got everything you want

104
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:54,036
honey, we know the names

105
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,539
we are the people
that can find

106
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:58,541
whatever you may need

107
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:00,042
if you've got
the money, honey

108
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,545
we got your disease

109
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,547
in the jungle,
welcome to the jungle

110
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:09,552
want to bring you
to your n-n-n-n knees, knees

111
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:12,054
i want to
watch you bleed

112
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,056
welcome to the jungle

113
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,058
we take it day by day

114
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,060
and if you want,
you're gonna bleed

115
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:20,062
but this is the price
you pay

116
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,066
aah!

117
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,073
In the jungle,
welcome to the jungle

118
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,582
it's all right.

119
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,584
Shh. It's all right.

120
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:44,086
It's all right.
It's all right.

121
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,088
What are you doing?

122
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:48,090
Go back
to your class.

123
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,592
Leave me alone!

124
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:51,093
Welcome to the jungle

125
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:53,095
it gets worse here
every day

126
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:54,597
learn to live like
an animal

127
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:56,599
in the jungle
where we play

128
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:58,601
you got to remember
what you see

129
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,603
you'll take it
eventually

130
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:02,605
you can have
anything you want

131
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,607
but you better not
take it from me

132
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:06,108
in the jungle

133
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:07,610
welcome to the jungle

134
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:12,615
want to bring you
to your n-n-n-n-knees, knees

135
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,117
what's up, brian?

136
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,619
I'm gonna
watch you bleed

137
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,129
when you're high

138
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,634
you never, ever
want to come down

139
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,638
so down, so down

140
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:38,140
so down

141
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:46,148
yeah, oh

142
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:27,189
yo! Where's
my money?

143
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,191
I said,
where's my money?

144
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,693
Where's my money?

145
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,194
Hey, hey, hey.

146
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,697
Stop it, stop it,
stop it.

147
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,211
In the jungle,
welcome to the jungle

148
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:53,716
want to bring you
to your n-n-n-n-knees, knees

149
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:55,217
in the jungle

150
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:56,719
welcome to the jungle

151
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,721
want to bring you
to your

152
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,223
it's gonna
bring you down

153
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,726
huh

154
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:06,729
don't make me
fight you, man.

155
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,230
Get in the locker.

156
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,232
Come on, man.

157
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,234
You're messing up
my books.

158
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:13,235
I'm gonna-

159
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,737
markus, what are
you doing?

160
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,739
Let him out.

161
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,742
He lives in there.
He likes it.

162
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:24,747
Somebody!

163
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,750
Somebody help!
Somebody help!

164
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,752
Help somebody,
please.

165
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:33,756
Help! Help me!

166
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:37,259
Let me out!

167
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,762
Somebody help!

168
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,264
Please, let me out!

169
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:45,267
Let me out, please!
Help!

170
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,269
Somebody let me out!

171
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,772
I can't breathe!

172
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,277
Somebody let me out,
please!

173
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:57,780
Somebody help me, please!

174
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,281
I can't breathe!

175
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:03,786
Somebody open up
the door!

176
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:04,787
Open the door, please!

177
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,273
Somebody let me out!

178
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,709
I just don't
goddamn believe it.

179
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,212
I've got an election
coming up,

180
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,714
and you hit me
with this now?

181
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,717
The state report came
from trenton just now.

182
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,720
And we... well, actually,
they ranked the schools.

183
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,723
We were last
in the state.

184
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,225
Oh, that's a crock.

185
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,228
They can't just take
my schools away.

186
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,729
You're quite right.

187
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,731
That's what
i thought.

188
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,734
But, well, no, see, now,
actually, they can.

189
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,735
What?

190
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,738
The house passed
a bill last week.

191
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,740
75% of high school
students

192
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,743
must pass the minimum
basic skills test,

193
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,746
or the state takes control
by the end of the school year.

194
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,249
Well, how many
passed last year?

195
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,251
About 38%.

196
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:53,252
38%?

197
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,754
What in god's name
are they doing

198
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,257
down there
at eastside?

199
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,259
They were
your appointees, don.

200
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,761
Don't try pinning
this on me.

201
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,763
You're
the superintendent

202
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,265
of schools,
remember?

203
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,268
Now, look, i'm not
going down the tubes

204
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:10,769
just because
those kids

205
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,771
can't pass
some test.

206
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:15,774
It's a can
of worms, don.

207
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,277
The only person
who would take this job

208
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,778
is someone
with nothing to lose

209
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,281
then the question becomes
what would we want with him?

210
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,783
I'm sitting here
racking my brain-

211
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,785
you're sitting there
setting me up.

212
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,788
I know you
like a book.

213
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,293
No, wait a minute.

214
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,794
No!

215
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,298
No, no, no, no, no,
not that nut! No!

216
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,799
No way!

217
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,303
He's the only guy
i can think of.

218
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,318
Oh, lord help us.

219
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,908
Derrick, derrick,
slow down, now.

220
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,910
I am, mr. Clark.

221
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,411
Slow down!

222
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:10,913
Bye, mr. Clark.

223
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,414
So long, kids.

224
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,916
Hey, joe.

225
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,919
Am i in trouble?
You gotta bring your lawyer?

226
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:17,920
Rosenberg.

227
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,922
Joe. Hot
for october.

228
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,924
How's it going
over here?

229
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,926
Ok. Same old,
same old.

230
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:25,928
What brings you down?

231
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,930
We came from
the mayor's office.

232
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:29,932
They need a new principal
at eastside high.

233
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,934
Gotta get
those test scores up.

234
00:12:31,969 --> 00:12:33,435
He specifically
thought of you.

235
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,436
Sure.

236
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,438
Ok. I thought
of you.

237
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,441
All this time
i been stuck down here,

238
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,443
and you ask me now, frank.

239
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,445
I'm not a miracle
worker, joe.

240
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,947
Hello,
dr. Napier.

241
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,949
Mr. Clark,
the girls

242
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,451
need that room
for baking class.

243
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:52,454
We continue to find
gum under the desks.

244
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,456
I'll make an announcement
in the morning.

245
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,958
Will that satisfy you?

246
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:57,459
Mrs. Hamilton, you
know mr. Rosenberg,

247
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:58,460
the school board
attorney.

248
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,461
Yes. How are you,
mr. Rosenberg?

249
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,463
Excuse us,
mrs. Hamilton.

250
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:03,465
Dr. Napier wants to
inspect our new sandbox.

251
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,968
Our sandbox?
I didn't mean to interrupt.

252
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:07,970
Good seeing you,
dr. Napier.

253
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,471
Yes, yes.

254
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,473
Forget about what
happened before.

255
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:13,475
This is a chance
to make changes,

256
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,977
stop blowing smoke
up each other's butts,

257
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:16,979
see if we can turn
this thing around.

258
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:19,481
You mean nobody else
wants the job?

259
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:20,983
Nobody i'd want.

260
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,985
You add my name
to the list.

261
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,987
You're bullshit.

262
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,989
Don't talk to me
about saving those kids.

263
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,491
The mayor wants
to save his budget,

264
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,993
and you want
to save your ass.

265
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:31,994
Well, so what.

266
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:32,995
You want
the truth, joe?

267
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,496
Yeah, frank.
Let's have some truth.

268
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,498
For all your talk

269
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,001
and all your
crazy joe routine,

270
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,502
what have you done?
Nothing!

271
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,004
You're nothing but
an insignificant man!

272
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:44,006
It's like
you were never born.

273
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,507
Your life hasn't
made any difference.

274
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,009
Neither has mine.

275
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:49,011
Want to take that
to the grave.

276
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,832
We want to welcome
mr. Clark to eastside.

277
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,334
We've heard so much
about you.

278
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,837
In anticipation
of your arrival,

279
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,840
ms. Levias, your other
vice principal, and i

280
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,842
have appointed
an executive committee

281
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:38,844
to oversee
certain areas

282
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,346
where we have noted
a need for improvement-

283
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,849
you may sit down,
mr. O'malley.

284
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,858
You think you can
run this school?

285
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,861
If you could,

286
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,363
then i wouldn't
be here, would i?

287
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,868
No one talks
in my meetings.

288
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,869
No one!

289
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,873
Take out your
pencils and write.

290
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,876
I want the names
of every hoodlum,

291
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,878
drug dealer,
and miscreant

292
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,379
who's done nothing

293
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,381
but take
this place apart

294
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,884
on my desk
by noon today.

295
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,888
Reverend slappy.

296
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,389
Yes, sir.

297
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,391
You're now
the chief custodian.

298
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,894
You will scour
this building clean.

299
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,897
Graffiti goes up,
it's off the next day.

300
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,898
Yes, sir.
The very next day.

301
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,900
Detention students
can help you.

302
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,402
Let them scrub
this place for a while.

303
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,405
And tear down those cages
in the cafeteria.

304
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,407
You treat them
like animals,

305
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,409
that's exactly
how they'll behave.

306
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,915
This is my new dean
of security,

307
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,416
mr. William wright.

308
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,919
He will be
my avenging angel

309
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,421
as you teachers
reclaim the halls.

310
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,924
This is an institution
of learning.

311
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,427
If you can't control it,
how can you teach?

312
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,433
Discipline is not the enemy
of enthusiasm.

313
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,937
Mr. Zirella.

314
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,938
Yes?

315
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,443
Mr. Zirella, you are now
my new head football coach.

316
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,444
Mr. Darnell.

317
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,948
Stand up,
mr. Darnell.

318
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,450
Mr. Darnell will be
your assistant.

319
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,953
You know why
you're being demoted?

320
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,955
Because i'm sick
and tired

321
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,457
of our football team getting
pushed all over the field.

322
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,959
Thank you. Sit down.

323
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,460
I want precision.

324
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,462
I want
a weight program.

325
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,465
If you don't like it,
mr. Darnell, quit.

326
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,467
Same goes
for the rest of you.

327
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,970
You've tried it your way
for years.

328
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,473
Your students can't pass
a minimum basic skills test.

329
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,976
That means they can
hardly read!

330
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,986
They've given me
less than one year,

331
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,989
one school year to turn
this place around,

332
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,491
to get those
test scores up

333
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,494
so the state
will not take us over

334
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,998
to perform the task
which you have failed to do-

335
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,000
to educate our children!

336
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,504
Forget about the way
it used to be.

337
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,506
It's not
a damn democracy.

338
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,009
We're in a state
of emergency,

339
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,011
and my word is law!

340
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,014
There's only one boss
in this place,

341
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,017
and that's me,
the h-n-l-c.

342
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,520
Are there
any questions?

343
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,027
Mr. Wright.

344
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,536
The h-n-l-c?

345
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,040
The head nigger
in charge.

346
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,262
Everybody, right up here,
right here.

347
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:01,763
Check this out.

348
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:07,769
When i want
your body...

349
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,273
george, brian, sams,
they want you onstage.

350
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,775
Let's go.

351
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,776
Right now.

352
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:16,778
Mrs. Santos,
what about us?

353
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,280
What about you?
What about me?

354
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,282
Sit down.

355
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,783
I said sit down.

356
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:24,286
What do they
want us for?

357
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,288
I don't know.
Go.

358
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:29,291
What do you got
to do around here

359
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,293
to get picked
for something?

360
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:32,794
Maria, sit down.

361
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,796
Get down

362
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:36,798
get down

363
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,801
some guys are lame

364
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:40,802
they want my fame

365
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,803
i got a girl
with juice

366
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,305
her name is deluce,
so check it out

367
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:45,807
look at chita,
holmes.

368
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,312
Let her
check me out, man.

369
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:53,315
Afraid of the girlies?
Flash some cash, boy.

370
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:55,817
Want some?
I'll give you some.

371
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,819
Buy her
some stupid gold.

372
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,821
Step off, man.

373
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:01,823
You're a joke.

374
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,359
Is this normal?

375
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm afraid so.

376
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,363
Is everybody
on the list onstage?

377
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:42,364
Yes, sir.

378
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:45,367
I gave their names
to homeroom teachers.

379
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:49,371
Ladies with the crabs
let me hear you say yeah!

380
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,873
Who's got the crabs?

381
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,375
Mr. Clark.

382
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,877
Don't you remember me?
Kaneesha.

383
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:58,380
Kaneesha,
how are you, baby?

384
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,381
You know him?

385
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,383
Oh, we go way back.

386
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:02,884
Fifth grade.

387
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,886
Yeah. How are
things going?

388
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,388
Ok.

389
00:20:06,423 --> 00:20:07,889
Just ok?

390
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:11,393
Listen, you have any problems,
come and see me.

391
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:14,896
I'm in my office
every morning at 6:00, ok?

392
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,898
Ok. Good to see you.

393
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,401
That was my elementary
school principal.

394
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,910
All right, people.
Settle down.

395
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,912
Get down
off the seats.

396
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:32,914
Settle down.

397
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:35,917
Settle down, boys and girls.
Settle down.

398
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,420
May i have
your attention?

399
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,922
Quiet.

400
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:44,426
Quiet down.
Take your seats.

401
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:46,428
You people sit down.
Sit down.

402
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,430
Quiet down.

403
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,932
I am your new principal.

404
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,935
My name is joe clark.

405
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,438
I want you to be quiet!

406
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,440
I want you to listen!

407
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,941
From here out,

408
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,944
there will be no smoking
in this school!

409
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,446
All of you who are smoking,

410
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:06,948
put out your cigarettes
on the soles of your shoes.

411
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:10,452
Put the butts
in your pockets now!

412
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:12,954
You, there. You.

413
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:14,956
Put out your cigarette.

414
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,959
I'm going to ask
the people onstage

415
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,462
to open
with our school song.

416
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:21,963
Mr. Roland.

417
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,965
Boy: Do you believe
this guy?

418
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:25,467
Go, go, sing!

419
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,969
Suck my dick!

420
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,972
You sing the song.
You sing it.

421
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,982
Joe: All right. That's enough,
mr. Roland.

422
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:42,984
That's enough.

423
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:50,492
I want all of you
to take a good look

424
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,495
at these people
on the risers behind me.

425
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:57,499
These people have been here
up to five years

426
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,502
and done absolutely nothing.

427
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:07,008
These people are
drug dealers and drug users.

428
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,011
They have taken up space.

429
00:22:10,512 --> 00:22:12,514
They have disrupted
this school.

430
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,516
They have harassed
your teachers,

431
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:17,969
and they have
intimidated you.

432
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,971
Well, times are
about to change.

433
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,975
You will not be bothered
in joe clark's school.

434
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,976
Yeah!

435
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:25,977
Shh!

436
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,480
These people
are incorrigible,

437
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,983
and since none of them
could graduate anyway,

438
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,986
you are all expurgated.

439
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,988
You are dismissed.

440
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,491
You are out of here
forever.

441
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,493
I wish you well.

442
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,994
Oh, shit.

443
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,996
Mr. Wright.

444
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,011
I don't need
your school.

445
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,014
I'm going in
the air force, man.

446
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,016
Know what i'm saying?

447
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,018
You know
what i'm saying?

448
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,020
I told you, man.

449
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,522
You ain't nobody.

450
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,024
I'm gonna
get you, man.

451
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,893
You ain't nobody.

452
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,009
Next time it may be you.

453
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,014
If you do no better
than they did,

454
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,516
next time itwillbe you.

455
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:41,519
They said this school
was dead

456
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,022
like the cemetery
it's built on,

457
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:48,526
but we call our eastside teams
ghosts, don't we?

458
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,528
And what are ghosts?

459
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:54,032
Ghosts are spirits
that rise from the dead.

460
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:59,037
I want you
to be my ghosts.

461
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,542
You are going to lead
our resurrection

462
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:07,545
by defying
the expectation

463
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,549
that all of us
are doomed to failure.

464
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,051
My motto is simple.

465
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,053
If you do not succeed in life,

466
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:18,056
i don't want you
to blame your parents.

467
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:21,559
I don't want you
to blame the white man.

468
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,562
I want you
to blame yourselves.

469
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,564
The responsibility
is yours!

470
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,071
In two weeks,
we have a practice exam

471
00:24:33,106 --> 00:24:38,076
and the minimum basic
skills test on april 13th.

472
00:24:38,111 --> 00:24:41,079
That's 110 school days
from now,

473
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:45,083
but it's not just about
those test scores.

474
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:49,587
If you do not have
these basic skills,

475
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:53,591
you will find yourselves
locked out,

476
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:56,594
locked out
of that american dream

477
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:59,097
that you see
advertised on tv,

478
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,600
that they tell you
is so easy to get.

479
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,603
You are here
for one reason,

480
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,605
one reason only-

481
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,607
to learn

482
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,610
to work
for what you want.

483
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,613
The alternative is
to waste your time

484
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:18,616
and to fall
into the trap

485
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:22,120
of crime, drugs,
and death.

486
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,623
Does everyone
understand that?

487
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,627
Do all of you
understand me?

488
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:34,132
Then welcome to the new
eastside high.

489
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,645
Mr. Clark
don't play.

490
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,356
What happened this
morning is an outrage.

491
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,358
My boy's no criminal.

492
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,360
Those children
belong in school,

493
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,362
not back out
on the street.

494
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:05,864
You're a fascist,
clark!

495
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,366
Our kids don't
deserve this!

496
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,868
Some of them
are smart.

497
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,369
They're just
discouraged

498
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,371
about their chances
out there,

499
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,374
what kind of jobs
they got waitin'.

500
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,377
Now what kind of
chance do they have?

501
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,881
He insulted the black
football coach.

502
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,883
The man's gone crazy.

503
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,385
He's declared war
on his own people.

504
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,387
Remember,
miss barrett,

505
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,889
mr. Clark
was nice enough

506
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,391
to come to this
emergency meeting

507
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,393
after a very
trying day.

508
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,397
I think we owe him
a chance to respond.

509
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:49,908
They say

510
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,912
one bad apple
spoils the bunch.

511
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,914
Man: My son
ain't no bad apple!

512
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,916
Well, what about 300?

513
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,419
Rotten to the core.

514
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,924
Now, you're right,
mrs. Barrett.

515
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,426
This is a war.

516
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,430
It's a war to save
2,700 other students,

517
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,433
most of whom don't have
the basic skills

518
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,435
to pass the state exam.

519
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,438
Now, if you want
to help us, fine.

520
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,942
Sit down with your kids
and make them study.

521
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,444
Go get your families
off welfare.

522
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,947
How dare you talk
about welfare!

523
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,949
Give our children
some pride.

524
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,952
Let them get their
priorities straight.

525
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,958
When dr. Napier
came to me

526
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,960
offering this job,

527
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:43,962
i saw the lightning flash.

528
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,463
All right!

529
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,465
I heard the thunder roll!

530
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,467
Give it to 'em!

531
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,470
I felt breakers crashing,
swamping my soul.

532
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,974
We are not in church,
mr. Clark!

533
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,977
I fell down
on my knees...

534
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,479
and i cried,
"my god...

535
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,982
why has thou
forsaken me?"

536
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,984
Tell 'em
about it.

537
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,487
And the lord said,
"joe, you're no damn good."

538
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,990
No, no. I mean this...

539
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,492
more than you realize.

540
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,996
"You're no earthly
good at all

541
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,999
"unless you take
this opportunity

542
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,502
and do whatever
you have to."

543
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,506
And he didn't say,
"joe, be polite."

544
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,512
Do whatever you have to

545
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,516
to transform and transmogrify
this school

546
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,518
into a special place,

547
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,523
where the hearts and souls
and minds of the young

548
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,525
can rise,

549
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,029
where they can
grow tall and blossom

550
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,033
out from under the shadows
of the past,

551
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,537
where the minds of the young
are set free.

552
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,039
That's right!

553
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:05,043
And i gave
my word to god.

554
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,047
And that's why
i threw those bastards out.

555
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,052
And that's all
i'm going to say.

556
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:41,295
Mr. Clark, i wanted to
talk to you

557
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,298
about those kids
you threw out yesterday.

558
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,300
Well,
what about them?

559
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:48,302
I was one of them,

560
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,304
but you made
some kind of mistake.

561
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,305
Mistake?

562
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,306
Yes, sir.

563
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,808
What's your name,
son?

564
00:29:53,843 --> 00:29:55,309
Sams.
Thomas sams.

565
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:58,312
Thomas sams.
You're a freshman?

566
00:29:58,347 --> 00:29:59,814
Yes, sir.

567
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,817
Cutting class and
smoking crack, mr. Sams.

568
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:03,818
There's no mistake.

569
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:07,822
No, sir. It wasn't me, sir.
I swear it wasn't.

570
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:12,326
It wasn't you?

571
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,828
No.

572
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:18,833
Do you think
i'm stupid, son?

573
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:20,334
No, sir.

574
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:21,836
Yes, you do.

575
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:24,839
You're trying to con
a con man.

576
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:26,841
You're not even
learning anything

577
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,843
on the streets,
are you?

578
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,846
You come with me.

579
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,362
What are you doing?
What's up here?

580
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:50,865
Now, let me
tell you something.

581
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,367
The trouble
with being a teenager

582
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,369
is you don't
know nothing.

583
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:58,873
You think you're smarter
than people who've already been

584
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,875
down the road
you're traveling.

585
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,376
You know
what i'm saying?

586
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:03,377
Do you?

587
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:04,378
Yes, sir.

588
00:31:04,413 --> 00:31:08,883
Did you tell your father
i threw you out of school?

589
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,885
Look at me, damn it!

590
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,886
No, sir.

591
00:31:12,386 --> 00:31:14,889
Why not?
No guts, huh?

592
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:17,892
Afraid of what
he'll say, aren't you?

593
00:31:17,927 --> 00:31:20,895
My father doesn't live
with us anymore, sir.

594
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,897
Is that what
you're doing?

595
00:31:22,932 --> 00:31:25,399
Going around feeling
sorry for yourself?

596
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:28,402
Get out of here!
You're wasting my time!

597
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:30,404
Please let me
back, sir.

598
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:33,407
I have to
get back at school.

599
00:31:33,442 --> 00:31:36,911
I can't tell my mama
i got kicked out.

600
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:39,914
Now, why should i let you
back into my school?

601
00:31:39,949 --> 00:31:42,917
Because i'm going
to do better, sir.

602
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:43,918
How?

603
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:45,920
By doing my work.

604
00:31:45,955 --> 00:31:47,421
What else?

605
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,423
And staying
out of trouble.

606
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:52,927
What have you been thinking
about all this time?

607
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:55,930
Why should i
believe you now?

608
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:58,432
Because
i changed my ways.

609
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,434
I don't believe you,
sams.

610
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:03,938
I don't think you've changed
a thing. Go on, jump!

611
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,440
No. I don't
want to jump.

612
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:09,944
Yes, you do!
You smoke crack, don't you?

613
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:11,946
You smoke crack,
don't you?

614
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,950
Look at me, boy!
Don't you smoke crack?

615
00:32:15,985 --> 00:32:17,451
Yes, sir.

616
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,454
You know what
that does to you, huh?

617
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:21,956
No, sir.

618
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:25,459
It kills brain cells, son.
It kills brain cells.

619
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,461
When you're destroying
brain cells,

620
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:28,462
you're killing yourself,

621
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:29,964
only it's slower!

622
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,966
If you want to
kill yourself,

623
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:33,467
don't fuck around with it!
Do it expeditiously!

624
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,469
Go on, jump!

625
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:37,972
No. I don't want
to kill myself, sir.

626
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,474
You're sure?

627
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,476
Yes, sir.

628
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:44,979
I tell you
what i'll do.

629
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:48,983
I'll go back on my own word
just this once

630
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:51,986
and let you back into
my school,

631
00:32:52,021 --> 00:32:54,488
'cause you're still a baby,
and you don't know shit.

632
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:56,991
But you understand
this, boy.

633
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,993
You're not gonna get
a moment's rest.

634
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:01,495
I'm gonna be on your case
every minute.

635
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:03,497
You mess up just once,

636
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:04,999
and you're out of here.

637
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:07,501
You understand me?

638
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:08,502
Do you understand me?

639
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:10,004
Yes, sir.

640
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,008
Now, go on
back downstairs.

641
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,775
All right, people.
Let's settle down in here.

642
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,777
Now, settle down,
quiet down.

643
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:36,781
Let those who are trying to
eat their lunch digest.

644
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:40,284
Robert, boy, you had lunch
at fourth period. Go on.

645
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,788
If mr. O'malley didn't
do anything, mr. Clark won't.

646
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:46,791
Louisa, you're looking
mighty good today.

647
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:48,793
Gonna have to tell
these boys to watch out.

648
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,795
You kids
having any problems?

649
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,797
Yeah. She is.
Tell him.

650
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,298
Louisa?

651
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,801
Why do i have
to take home ec?

652
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,303
I want to take auto shop.

653
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:02,306
I have brothers and sisters.
My mother works.

654
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,809
I've been cooking
for 11 years.

655
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,812
Does it look
like i don't cook?

656
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:11,315
I want you to take this
to mr. O'malley.

657
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,318
You know how much
auto mechanics make?

658
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,320
$17 an hour.

659
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,322
Boy: That girl
right there, man.

660
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,826
Yo, sweetheart. Right here.
I got hunger pains, baby.

661
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,828
You could be my lunch.

662
00:34:23,863 --> 00:34:27,331
Boy, get off this table!
Get your hormones together!

663
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,333
It ain't hormones.

664
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,335
She's fly, man.
She's a fox.

665
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,838
I just saw you with your
arms around clarisse.

666
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,841
You honked off
with that skeezer?

667
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,842
No, i never-

668
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,845
check it out.
It was only one time.

669
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,346
Chill out, man!

670
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,349
Richard, for your first job
as class president,

671
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,852
i want to build
an atrium.

672
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,855
Track me down tomorrow.
We'll talk about it.

673
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,857
Don't worry about it.

674
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,860
How you doin', brother?
Good to see you.

675
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,361
Oh, you, hey!

676
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,363
Yes, mr. Clark?

677
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,865
What's your name?

678
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,866
Kid ray.
How you doin'?

679
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:02,867
Nice suit.

680
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,869
Just like you,
mr. Clark.

681
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:06,871
Got to
look the part.

682
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:08,873
These kids don't
understand that.

683
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,378
Hey!

684
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:17,381
Sams, put it back!
Put it back!

685
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,384
How many times have
i told you, boy?

686
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,387
Put something in
your head, not on it.

687
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,889
Pull your pants up!

688
00:35:24,924 --> 00:35:27,391
Show some dignity!
Have some sense!

689
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:30,394
What's he doing
hanging out with you seniors?

690
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,897
You're providing
a deleterious influence here.

691
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:34,899
Mr. Clark,
he's my cousin.

692
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:36,901
We was just
goin' over music.

693
00:35:36,936 --> 00:35:38,402
Music, huh?

694
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:40,404
Come here.

695
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,410
Let me have your attention.
Everyone quiet down!

696
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,413
I want all radios off
instantaneously.

697
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,915
All radios off.

698
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:55,419
I want all of you

699
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,421
to look at this...

700
00:35:57,456 --> 00:35:59,924
slovenly, sloppy boy here...

701
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,927
as an example
of how not to dress.

702
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:05,429
Now, if you
look like this

703
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:08,432
when you look in your mirrors
in the morning,

704
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,935
find something else
to put on.

705
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,942
Self-respect permeates
every aspect of your lives.

706
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:20,945
If you don't have it
for yourselves,

707
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,948
you're not going to get it
from anywhere.

708
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,451
Now, to prove
their self-respect,

709
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:31,455
mr. Sams and his friends here-
you boys stand up.

710
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,458
I'm going to
pound him.

711
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,460
Mr. Sams and his friends

712
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,463
are going to sing
our school song.

713
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,465
I want
absolute silence.

714
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,968
No one
is permitted to move

715
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,971
during the singing
of the school song.

716
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,473
All right.
Let's hear it.

717
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,977
Fair eastside

718
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,478
by the road-

719
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:57,481
mr. Darnell, no one
is permitted to move

720
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:58,983
during the song!

721
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,985
I was picking up
trash.

722
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,987
Report to my office!
Immediately!

723
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,488
Woo!

724
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:06,490
Quiet!
Quiet in here!

725
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,993
Ha ha ha!

726
00:37:09,028 --> 00:37:11,495
Ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

727
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,499
All right. Continue.

728
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,002
So cheer for...?

729
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,006
You boys are on detention,
3 days each.

730
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,008
You will
learn this song,

731
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,510
or next time,
you'll be suspended.

732
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,013
This goes for everybody!

733
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,017
You will sing the school song
upon demand,

734
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:36,020
or you will suffer
dire consequences!

735
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:39,523
Mr. Wright, take this
riffraff to my office.

736
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,526
Hit the road, jack

737
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,527
and don't you come back?

738
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:46,030
No more, no more,
no more, no more

739
00:37:46,065 --> 00:37:47,531
hit the road, jack

740
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:50,034
and don't you come back
no more

741
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:51,468
what you say?

742
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:54,738
O, o glorious

743
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,741
is thy name

744
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,744
o mighty lord

745
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,250
glorious is thy name-

746
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,252
people, what are you-

747
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,754
can i help you,
mr. Clark?

748
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,256
Yes, you may.
I want everyone

749
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,259
to be able to sing the
school song on demand

750
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,761
or be suspended.
Can you see to that?

751
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,264
Certainly, mr. Clark.
From the top-

752
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:24,268
mrs. Elliott, may i see
you in the hall, please?

753
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,269
Now?

754
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,770
Yes, now!

755
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,774
Will you see if you can
get these people together?

756
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,276
Mm-hmm.

757
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:35,279
If you sing like that
in new york,

758
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,781
we will not
be invited back.

759
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,786
I don't like
being ignored.

760
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,789
I'm sorry if you weren't
getting enough attention,

761
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,791
but i'm training a chorus.

762
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,793
You don't think the school
song is important enough

763
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,795
to warrant
a little interruption?

764
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,797
It's fine, but we
were doing mozart.

765
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,300
We were in the middle
of a difficult part.

766
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,801
If you'd like us
to respect your work,

767
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,303
try to appreciate ours.

768
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:01,805
Who do you think
you're talking to?

769
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,309
A man who seems threatened
when any other adult

770
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,810
does something
the children like.

771
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,815
Mrs. Powers, i want it quiet
in here right now!

772
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,318
I'd love to chat,
mr. Clark,

773
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,321
but i have a concert
next week in new york,

774
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,822
and i'd like to be
prepared.

775
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:19,823
What?

776
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,326
Prepared-you know
what that means-

777
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:25,329
capable, ready,
and up to your job.

778
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,830
What concert?

779
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,833
The one at lincoln center.
We do it every year.

780
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,835
Until now. Your concert
is canceled.

781
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,836
What?
Cancelled!

782
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,339
You know what canceled
means, don't you?

783
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,840
Over, finished,
terminated!

784
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,842
Why? They've worked
too hard!

785
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,844
For not telling me.

786
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,847
Oh, i filed a form
in your office!

787
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,849
And for rank
insubordination!

788
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,351
You've questioned my
judgment, intelligence!

789
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,353
You're the one who comes
around here to bother me.

790
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,855
You're a despicable man!
I've nothing to say to you.

791
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,857
Let's accommodate that.
You're fired!

792
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,859
You need
a psychiatrist!

793
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,861
Get out!
Right now!

794
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,864
Fine! Fired? You'll hear
from my lawyer!

795
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,436
Mr. Clark.

796
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,939
Ms. Levias, these miscreants
don't know the school song.

797
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:27,941
They've got
3 days' detention.

798
00:40:27,976 --> 00:40:29,943
Mr. Darnell,
into my office.

799
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,445
Fellas, come on up.

800
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,447
What was that all about?

801
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,449
I said no one move
during the school song.

802
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:38,452
If you can't understand
that, find another job.

803
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,454
I was picking up
paper!

804
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:42,956
You contradicted me
in front of my students!

805
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:44,458
They'remystudents!

806
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,960
They are my students,
mr. Darnell!

807
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:48,962
Just what are you
trying to prove?

808
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,465
I'm working
my ass off for you.

809
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,467
I took the demotion.
I'm doing my job!

810
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,469
You're just
getting your rocks off

811
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:56,970
by treating me like trash.

812
00:40:57,005 --> 00:40:58,972
No, sir. That's what
you were picking up.

813
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,974
God damn it!

814
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,977
You give me the goddamn respect
you would want yourself,

815
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:05,979
or i will kick
your black ass!

816
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,483
You are suspended,
sir, as of right now!

817
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:10,984
Get out!

818
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,989
Ahh!

819
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,503
Oh, my god!

820
00:41:29,538 --> 00:41:31,505
What is going on?

821
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,507
Mr. Darnell is suspended.
Indefinitely.

822
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:37,010
You don't have the power
to suspend a teacher!

823
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:40,013
Then i can recommend.
Get me the forms.

824
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:41,515
Yes, sir.

825
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,518
Please, mr. Darnell is more
than a football coach.

826
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:46,019
He teaches english!

827
00:41:46,054 --> 00:41:47,521
Not anymore.

828
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:51,525
The state practice test
is tomorrow. Why do this now?

829
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,026
Ms. Levias-

830
00:41:53,061 --> 00:41:54,528
mr. Clark?

831
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,530
What do you want?
What?

832
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:58,031
It could wait.

833
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:04,538
Mr. Clark,
do you have any idea

834
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:07,541
of the chaos you have
caused around here?

835
00:42:07,576 --> 00:42:09,543
Nobody knows
what you're doing!

836
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:11,995
That's exactly
the way i like it!

837
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,798
Never made first period
for one year straight

838
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:17,801
forget a diploma,
it's education i hate

839
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,804
i feel like droppin' my books
and just strafin' it

840
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,806
'cause the way i'm feelin',
i ain't makin' it

841
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,308
i ain't makin' it

842
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,320
school's the place
i don't really want to be in

843
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,323
the day i quit,
that's it, i'm leavin'

844
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:42,326
when people tell me
about gettin' grades up

845
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:45,329
my reply-"am i gettin' paid
or what?"

846
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,836
Bright in the morning,
my alarm awakes me

847
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:55,339
my mom won't, she's a witch,
she hates me

848
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:58,342
failin' all my classes,
i don't give a damn

849
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,354
success,
i ain't makin' it

850
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:13,857
stay to your right.
Let's get to your classes.

851
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:17,861
Come on, now.
We got 20 seconds to the bell.

852
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:21,365
Let's go. Sams, sams,
come here. Where you going?

853
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,367
Lunch.

854
00:43:23,402 --> 00:43:25,869
Try to eat
some vegetables

855
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:27,371
for a change, ok?

856
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:29,373
Lay off
those muffins.

857
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:30,874
See you later.

858
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,377
Don't bunch up
down there, people.

859
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:37,381
That doesn't concern you.
We'll tell you about it later.

860
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,385
All right, richard.
It's all yours.

861
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,887
We have two groups
to thank-

862
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,889
the black and hispanic
alumnl-

863
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:47,891
for giving us
sofas and armchairs.

864
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,893
It makes the school
seem, as mr. Clark

865
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:52,396
would say, a home
away from home.

866
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:53,897
Having fun?

867
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,399
I am.

868
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:58,902
I haven't heard a word
about those test scores.

869
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:00,404
They'll send them-

870
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,906
send them how?
By pony express?

871
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,909
Am i supposed to
wait for them?

872
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,911
Get yourself
down to trenton,

873
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,414
where they're probably
on some desk.

874
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:13,917
Bring them back here
where they can do some good.

875
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,420
But now, ladies
and gentlemen,

876
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:17,921
for the grand finale-

877
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,923
ms. Levias,
if you would-

878
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,426
our very own
passaic river falls.

879
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:27,931
Good job. You're doing
very well, son.

880
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,933
I'm very
proud of you.

881
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,936
Mr. Clark,
come to the cafeteria quick!

882
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,439
Some guy's
beating up kid ray!

883
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,952
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!

884
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,960
Come on, old man.
I been waitin' for this.

885
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:58,962
Come on.
Come on.

886
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,967
Get this disgrace
to his race out of here!

887
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,470
You already threw
this disgrace out once.

888
00:45:06,505 --> 00:45:08,472
Then what's
he doing back?

889
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,474
Someone must have
let him in from the inside.

890
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,480
I want every door
in this school

891
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:17,981
chained and locked-

892
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,483
all of them!
Yes, sir.

893
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,089
Hi, mr. Clark.

894
00:45:42,124 --> 00:45:44,591
Oh, hi, kids.
How you doin'?

895
00:45:44,626 --> 00:45:46,593
Hi, mr. Clark.
What's up?

896
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:48,095
Hi, nathalee.

897
00:45:59,606 --> 00:46:02,609
Kaneesha, what's
the matter, doll?

898
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:06,613
Kaneesha?

899
00:46:06,648 --> 00:46:10,117
Now, i told you if you
have any problems,

900
00:46:10,152 --> 00:46:12,119
you come and see me.

901
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:15,622
Come on, now.

902
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:19,126
I've known you more
than half your life.

903
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:22,129
What's the matter?
How are your grades?

904
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:24,131
They're not too good.

905
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:27,134
Well, why not?
You're a smart girl.

906
00:46:27,169 --> 00:46:29,636
You shouldn't be
having any problems.

907
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:32,139
I don't have
no place to live.

908
00:46:32,174 --> 00:46:34,141
Well, where's
your mother?

909
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:38,145
She don't want me
no more.

910
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:41,648
Now, here.
Come with me. Come on.

911
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:44,651
I'll see what i can do
about this.

912
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:47,654
Ms. Levias, you know
kaneesha carter here.

913
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:50,657
You go on in
to miss ruiz.

914
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,659
Is he all right?

915
00:46:52,694 --> 00:46:54,161
He'll survive.

916
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:57,164
Kaneesha here is having
a problem at home.

917
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,168
Pull her file, talk to her,
get back to me.

918
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:03,170
Come on, kaneesha.

919
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:10,677
Because it
never made a difference

920
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:13,680
i never paid attention
to the sound

921
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:16,183
of my own despair

922
00:47:16,683 --> 00:47:17,684
trick or treat!

923
00:47:18,185 --> 00:47:22,189
There was
never no feelin'

924
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:25,192
never not needing
that child

925
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:30,197
even though
i couldn't always be there

926
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:36,203
and time don't wait
on love, now

927
00:47:36,238 --> 00:47:38,205
life don't wait

928
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,211
for a break
in the weather

929
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:45,212
what if i'm left

930
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:49,716
with no love at all?

931
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,718
No love at all?

932
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,222
Who's there?

933
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,723
Mrs. Carter?

934
00:47:56,758 --> 00:47:58,725
Mrs. Carter
doesn't live here.

935
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,227
Kaneesha: Mama, it's me.

936
00:48:00,262 --> 00:48:03,230
It's joan levias
from eastside.

937
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:06,233
I'm here
with mr. Clark.

938
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:12,239
'Cause time
don't wait on love, now

939
00:48:12,274 --> 00:48:18,745
and life don't send you
an invitation

940
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:22,749
been a long time,
mrs. Carter.

941
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,252
Please.

942
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:26,753
Come in.

943
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,762
No love at all

944
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:40,767
i've been meaning to come by
and talk to you.

945
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:44,771
Mind if i try and act
civilized for a moment?

946
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:47,274
Offered you two
a seat.

947
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:55,282
Mrs. Carter, i ran into
kaneesha in the halls.

948
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:57,784
Was talking
about her grades.

949
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:00,787
She says you don't want
her around anymore.

950
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:03,790
I don't expect
your sympathy,

951
00:49:03,825 --> 00:49:06,293
but i ruined my life.

952
00:49:06,328 --> 00:49:09,296
I know that's my business
to deal with that.

953
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:11,298
It's been hard enough.

954
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:14,301
Joe: When kaneesha
was in the fifth grade,

955
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:16,803
you were one of my most
active parents.

956
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:18,805
You were always
at school helping out.

957
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,807
We don't mean
to pry, mrs. Carter,

958
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:23,310
but kaneesha
has a gift.

959
00:49:23,345 --> 00:49:26,313
She has that spark.
We have to look after her.

960
00:49:26,348 --> 00:49:28,815
Why would she think
you wouldn't want her?

961
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:32,819
I had kaneesha
when i was 15.

962
00:49:32,854 --> 00:49:36,323
I didn't want
no welfare,

963
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:38,325
so i quit school,
worked,

964
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,327
came home at night,

965
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:43,330
didn't have no life.

966
00:49:43,365 --> 00:49:48,835
So when she was old enough
to take care of herself,

967
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,338
i ran out and got one.

968
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:53,840
Is that what
you're doing now?

969
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:57,844
I'm just now getting back
on my feet, you know?

970
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,349
As i get clean...

971
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:08,855
i see myself
for what i am...

972
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:14,861
and i hate it.

973
00:50:17,864 --> 00:50:23,870
And i don't want her
to see me like this no more.

974
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:27,874
So when the people from
the foster home came by,

975
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:31,878
i thought it was
the right thing to do.

976
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:36,383
Why would i want
to get rid of her?

977
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:41,888
I love her...

978
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:43,890
more than myself.

979
00:50:57,404 --> 00:50:58,905
Mrs. Carter...

980
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:04,411
if we helped you
find a job,

981
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:06,913
a better place
to live,

982
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,915
would that help?

983
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,917
Because, frankly,

984
00:51:10,952 --> 00:51:12,919
i don't see
kaneesha making it

985
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,421
without you.

986
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:15,922
Do you understand?

987
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:23,930
Yeah.

988
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:26,433
Good.

989
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,724
Thanks, bob.
We'll talk tomorrow.

990
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,735
What was that
all about?

991
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,737
Chains on the doors.

992
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,240
Thought you people
didn't like chains.

993
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,248
You see this yet?

994
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,259
You know,
all of your shit

995
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:11,261
comes down
on my head.

996
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,263
Oh, frank, look.
This is-

997
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:15,765
no. You let me talk.

998
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,767
It's like you're
a big bird with radar.

999
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,269
I'm tired of getting hit.

1000
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,770
Is this my fault?

1001
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,272
This is nothing!

1002
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:24,774
I've got union lawyers
threatening me.

1003
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,776
There's talk
of a walkout.

1004
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,278
Let 'em!

1005
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:30,280
They're not teaching
anything anyway!

1006
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,282
Then do something
about it!

1007
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:33,283
Not one of 'em
has a personal stake

1008
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,285
in that school!
Not one!

1009
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,788
The fire chief says
it's illegal to bar doors.

1010
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,292
Mrs. Barrett is organizing
a parents group to remove you

1011
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,295
since you suggested that
they get off welfare

1012
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,298
because quite a few
of them need it.

1013
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,301
I wasn't talking
to all of them, frank.

1014
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,303
Look, you came
and recruited me, man.

1015
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,305
You disappoint me.

1016
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,307
The disappointment
here is you!

1017
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:58,308
Me?

1018
00:52:58,343 --> 00:52:59,309
Yes!

1019
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:00,810
You've known me
30 years.

1020
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,812
You know
how i operate.

1021
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,315
Nigger,
can you keep quiet?

1022
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,817
The fact is
you're screwing up!

1023
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,320
You're alienating
everybody!

1024
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,323
You have no life.
Your wife left you.

1025
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,824
I ought to
walk out myself!

1026
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:15,825
Go ahead,
bail out!

1027
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,327
I said
i'd back you up!

1028
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:19,329
That's what
yousaid, frank!

1029
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:22,332
Brother, i'll go
through the fire with you,

1030
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,834
but you are not
taking care of business.

1031
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,336
But this shit you're
pulling now,

1032
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,338
you've just gone
plain loco!

1033
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,341
You suspend darnell!
What the hell was that?

1034
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:33,843
Darnell is symptomatic
of disciplinary-

1035
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,846
he is a good, strong,
young black teacher!

1036
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,350
He dumped that desk
on top of your head.

1037
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:43,353
Good for him.
You will reinstate that man!

1038
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:45,355
You fire
mrs. Elliott. Why?

1039
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,857
She didn't want to
kiss your ass.

1040
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:49,359
I wouldn't either!

1041
00:53:49,394 --> 00:53:51,861
Mrs. Elliott
has an ego problem.

1042
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:54,864
Well, you lost
the best teacher we had!

1043
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,867
I don't have time for
mrs. Elliott's problem!

1044
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,369
You better make time!

1045
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,871
We're being crucified
by a process

1046
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:02,872
that's turning blacks

1047
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,874
into a permanent
underclass here!

1048
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,877
See? Nobody wants
to talk about that!

1049
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,380
Mrs. Elliott's missionary
zeal about mozart

1050
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:13,383
has nothing to do
with our problem!

1051
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:15,385
What good will mozart do

1052
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,887
children who can't
go out and get a job?

1053
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,889
Joe,
your personal battles

1054
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:22,892
are going to
cost us the war.

1055
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,894
Worry about
the test scores.

1056
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,897
What the hell you think
i'm worried about?

1057
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:28,898
End of discussion!
Debate is over!

1058
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,401
You will write
a formal apology

1059
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:34,404
for your treatment
of mrs. Elliott and darnell

1060
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:38,408
and for your thoughtless insult
to the women of this community!

1061
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:41,411
You will kowtow
and step and fetch.

1062
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:45,415
Get used to it!
It's the way of the world!

1063
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,917
If you're so hot
on discipline,

1064
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,919
then start
by accepting mine

1065
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,921
because contrary
to popular opinion,

1066
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,924
i am the head nigger
in charge!

1067
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,434
Come on. Let's get
something to eat.

1068
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,445
Boy...

1069
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,948
you really think
you bad, don't you?

1070
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:24,120
You're all in violation
of the fire code!

1071
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,123
You cannot prevent me
from going in.

1072
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,125
You're not getting in,

1073
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,627
and that's that.

1074
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,630
You have no right
to lock these doors.

1075
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:36,633
This isn't a plant.
This is my school.

1076
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:38,635
If you want
to get in here,

1077
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,638
apply for a pass
like everyone else.

1078
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:44,140
What the hell
is the bat for?

1079
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,142
They used to call me
crazy joe.

1080
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:49,145
Now they can call me
batman.

1081
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,649
I got thugs and drug dealers
trying to get into my school.

1082
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:54,651
You might be one.
I don't know.

1083
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,152
Are you crazy?

1084
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,154
I got all day,
chief.

1085
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,157
How much time
do you have?

1086
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,159
I'll be back, clark.

1087
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:08,164
Thanks, mr. Darnell.
Good to have you back.

1088
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,667
You shouldn't have fired me
in the first place.

1089
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:13,169
You're right, but don't
get used to it.

1090
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:16,172
Mr. Clark, why did you
lock the school?

1091
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,174
Aren't you concerned
about students' safety?

1092
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:21,177
Get these people
back to their classes.

1093
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,180
Honey, get back
to your class.

1094
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,182
You're playing
into his hands.

1095
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,684
That was
the fire chief.

1096
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,185
Know what he's saying
right now?

1097
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,187
"Black bastard
can't throw me out,"

1098
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:34,691
know where he's saying it?
Out in the parking lot.

1099
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:36,693
Mr. Clark,
a baseball bat?

1100
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,194
If they'd got me
those emergency doors

1101
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,696
that sound an alarm
when you open them up

1102
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,698
like the ones
white schools have,

1103
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,700
i wouldn't
have to chain them.

1104
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:44,701
Those doors cost
a fortune.

1105
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,202
We don't have enough
money for books.

1106
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,204
Tell the mayor that.
Call the federal government.

1107
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,707
Never mind
what i'm doing.

1108
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,710
Why don't you do
what i ask you?

1109
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:55,211
Where are those
test scores i asked for?

1110
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,680
Hey, mr. Clark.

1111
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,682
Hi. Where you been?

1112
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:01,184
I was sick.

1113
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:02,685
Sick, huh?
Hi, eric.

1114
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,687
What was that
altercation about?

1115
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:07,190
Alteration?
Are my pants too tight?

1116
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:08,691
The fight you had
in the cafeteria.

1117
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,193
Don't get cute with me.

1118
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:12,695
I've already had enough
shit from this.

1119
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,199
Why did he come after you?
You dealing drugs?

1120
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:18,201
We don't need
to get into this.

1121
00:57:18,236 --> 00:57:19,702
I just came here
to tell you something.

1122
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:22,705
I don't think
i'm cut out for school.

1123
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,708
I just came
to say good-bye.

1124
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,715
Dropping out
on me, huh?

1125
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,218
I'm not dropping out.
I'm moving on.

1126
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:37,220
You'll be dead
in a year, son.

1127
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:40,223
You hear
what i'm saying?

1128
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,726
You'll be dead
in a year.

1129
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,234
Mr. Clark,
i got to go.

1130
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,131
You know, baby,
i look at you,

1131
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:26,135
and i want to do
the hootchie cootchie.

1132
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,138
Hootchie cootchie,
that's what i'm doing.

1133
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,140
You know, sometime,
baby.

1134
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,645
Come on, fellas,
not again.

1135
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,146
Sams, freeze.

1136
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:41,150
Where are you
running off to?

1137
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,653
Why aren't you
carrying a book?

1138
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:45,154
I got lunch
then gym-

1139
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,656
why did i let you
back in here?

1140
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:47,657
To get an education.

1141
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,659
How you gonna get an
education if you don't read?

1142
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:50,660
I read.

1143
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,663
When do you get
your report card?

1144
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,666
Next week. Miss james
says i'm getting a "b."

1145
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,668
I knew you were smart.

1146
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:01,170
I knew it, too.
See you later. Nice tie.

1147
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,676
Sams, get back here.

1148
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,684
Let's see
what's in here.

1149
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:16,686
You don't want to go
in there. It stinks.

1150
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,194
My, my, my.

1151
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,196
Aren't you
my little songbirds

1152
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,699
from the cafeteria?

1153
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,201
Weren't they with you?

1154
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,203
Who, these guys?

1155
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:38,207
I'm sure you've learned
the school song by now.

1156
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,209
You better know it

1157
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,210
because this time

1158
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,713
if you don't
get it right,

1159
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,215
you're suspended
for 10 days each.

1160
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,717
Is that clear?

1161
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,218
Yes, sir.

1162
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,220
All right,
let me hear it.

1163
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,724
All right, fellas,
let him hear it.

1164
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,227
Fair eastside

1165
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,736
fair eastsl-l-ide

1166
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,743
fair eastside

1167
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:17,747
by thy side
we'll stand

1168
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:22,251
and always
praise thy name

1169
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:25,755
praise thy name,
praise thy name

1170
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,257
to heaven, yeah

1171
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:32,762
lend our hearts
and hands

1172
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:37,767
to help increase
thy fame

1173
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:40,269
ooh, lord

1174
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,272
the honor, yeah

1175
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:47,276
of old eastside high

1176
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:51,781
calls forth
our loyalty

1177
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:54,784
loyalty, loyalty

1178
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,285
so cheer-

1179
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,287
all right,
all right!

1180
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,289
Who taught you that?

1181
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,292
Answer me!

1182
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,795
I know you didn't
do it yourselves.

1183
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,797
Sams!

1184
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,799
What?

1185
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:12,301
Who taught you this song?

1186
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,302
Speak up!

1187
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,304
Mrs. Powers.

1188
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,807
Mrs. Powers, eh?

1189
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:20,810
Come with me, all of you.

1190
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,313
...out this world

1191
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,315
gonna shoulder up
my cross

1192
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,817
gonna take it home
to my jesus

1193
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:29,819
ain't that good news?

1194
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:31,320
I got a savior
in that kingdom

1195
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,322
ain't that good news?

1196
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,824
I got a savior
in that kingdom

1197
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,827
ain't that good news?

1198
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,328
No, no, no, people.

1199
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,330
You must remember,

1200
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:45,334
we need intonation,
phonation, accuracy, and pitch.

1201
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,336
Now, this is your note.

1202
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,338
Hmm

1203
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:50,840
mrs. Powers.

1204
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,341
Yes, sir.

1205
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,343
These hoodlums
told me something.

1206
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,846
Did you change
the school song?

1207
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,848
Mrs. Powers-

1208
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,349
let her answer!

1209
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,352
The children thought
the song was boring.

1210
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,854
Boring, huh?

1211
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,356
I have
never heard

1212
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,357
a school song
like that.

1213
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,861
I didn't authorize
you to change it,

1214
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,863
did i?

1215
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:16,365
No, you didn't.

1216
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:22,371
I want everyone
to learn that song

1217
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:25,374
in english and spanish.
Immediately.

1218
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:27,376
Take a bow,
mrs. Powers.

1219
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:30,880
You've rewritten
our alma mater.

1220
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:33,382
The honor

1221
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,385
of old eastside high

1222
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,388
brings forth
our loyalty

1223
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,891
loyalty, loyalty

1224
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:47,897
so cheer for dear
old eastside...

1225
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:50,399
how's it going?

1226
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,902
What you got
in there, malachi?

1227
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,403
My future.

1228
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:55,905
All right.

1229
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,907
...aboard eastside

1230
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:00,409
all aboard, all aboard

1231
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,912
yes, eastside

1232
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,414
all aboard, all aboard

1233
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,416
how's it going,
mr. Darnell?

1234
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,418
Good, good.
That's great.

1235
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,920
...high

1236
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:13,923
ge-e-et

1237
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,424
fellas?

1238
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:19,428
On

1239
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:20,930
that

1240
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,932
train
train

1241
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,433
train

1242
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,935
ms. Levias...

1243
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,937
hi, mr. Clark.

1244
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:30,940
I just heard something
you wouldn't believe.

1245
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,942
Uh, mr. Clark,

1246
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:36,445
mr. O'malley just brought
this from trenton.

1247
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,451
The school's
practice test.

1248
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,967
I had to wait
all this time for this?

1249
01:03:58,002 --> 01:04:00,469
Next time i order you
to go get something,

1250
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:03,973
you better damn well
go get it yourself!

1251
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:09,111
Oh, no.
Oh, my god.

1252
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,616
Give me your
attention, everyone.

1253
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:16,619
First three rows
take 4 steps forward.

1254
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:18,621
Right now! Come on!

1255
01:04:18,656 --> 01:04:21,123
1, 2, 3, 4.

1256
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:24,126
Ok, that's good.
Turn around.

1257
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:26,128
Hold it,
mr. O'malley!

1258
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,630
What's
your excuse?

1259
01:04:27,665 --> 01:04:31,133
I was filling out
a big stack of forms.

1260
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:33,135
I didn't know
what time it was.

1261
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,137
This is a prime example

1262
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:38,140
of the kind of
inefficiency and apathy

1263
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:40,643
that is destroying
this school.

1264
01:04:40,678 --> 01:04:43,646
Mr. O'malley, i can't
believe you're that bad.

1265
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:47,149
I'll give you a chance
to revitalize your image.

1266
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:49,652
Set up a student-peer
tutoring program.

1267
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:52,154
Maybe the students
can help themselves.

1268
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,157
Lord knows, you teachers
aren't doing the job.

1269
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:58,160
Ms. Levias, i want
remedial reading on saturdays.

1270
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:00,162
Volunteers will get
regular pay.

1271
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,164
We can't afford
overtime.

1272
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,167
Mr. Clark, the problem
isn't our pay.

1273
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,169
What is the problem
as you see it?

1274
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:10,673
How to get the students
in on saturday.

1275
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,675
You hear that, people?

1276
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:16,178
How do we get the students
in on saturdays

1277
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:17,680
for remedial reading?

1278
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:18,681
I'll tell you how.

1279
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,183
We'll go to their homes.

1280
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:23,185
We'll talk to their folks.

1281
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,187
If their folks
can't read,

1282
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,190
they can come in, too.

1283
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:31,193
The only way
we'll get anything done

1284
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:33,696
is to get everyone
involved.

1285
01:05:33,731 --> 01:05:36,699
And that goes
for all of you!

1286
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,701
It's time
to get involved.

1287
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:42,705
Everyone in this section,

1288
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,207
put both your hands
above your heads.

1289
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,209
Raise your hands!

1290
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:49,211
Put them up!

1291
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:58,721
You people represent
the 70% of our students

1292
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:01,223
who just failed
the practice exam.

1293
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:04,226
70%!

1294
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:07,229
But that is not
their failure.

1295
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:10,733
I don't blame them.

1296
01:06:10,768 --> 01:06:13,235
The failure is yours.

1297
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:17,239
That's right, yours.

1298
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:20,743
How many hours do you spend
preparing your lesson plans?

1299
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:23,746
How often do you
stay after school

1300
01:06:23,781 --> 01:06:25,748
to give those children-

1301
01:06:25,783 --> 01:06:28,250
the ones
you know need it-

1302
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,753
the extra help
that they require?

1303
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,255
Keep your hands up.

1304
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:37,760
Now you're getting a hint
of the hopelessness and shame

1305
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:39,762
that makes those
failing students

1306
01:06:39,797 --> 01:06:41,764
throw up their hands

1307
01:06:41,799 --> 01:06:44,767
at the thought
of facing a world

1308
01:06:44,802 --> 01:06:47,269
for which you have not
prepared them.

1309
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:51,273
You're getting an inkling
of the despair they feel

1310
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:54,276
when left to the mercy
of the streets.

1311
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,278
Keep your hands up high.

1312
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,280
Look around
at yourselves.

1313
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,282
Turn and look
at yourselves!

1314
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:08,791
Because you are failing
to educate them,

1315
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:12,294
this is the posture
our students will wind up in,

1316
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:15,798
only they'll be staring
down the barrel of a gun!

1317
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:28,010
Ooh, yeah, yeah

1318
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:29,511
ahh ha ha

1319
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,523
if a man is born
in luxury

1320
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,027
it proves to me
through history

1321
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:48,030
he is somebody

1322
01:07:48,065 --> 01:07:50,032
if a man is born
in poverty

1323
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:53,535
privation and misery

1324
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,538
he is nobody

1325
01:07:56,573 --> 01:08:00,042
everybody is somebody

1326
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:04,546
nobody is nobody

1327
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,549
i mean, apart
from all the wealthy

1328
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:09,051
ooh

1329
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,054
everybody is somebody

1330
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:15,557
oh, yeah

1331
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,559
so look at me here, man?

1332
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,063
Ooh ooh ooh

1333
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:22,564
oh, yeah

1334
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,568
ooh ooh ooh

1335
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,070
poverty is what,
what it takes

1336
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:32,074
it makes such dangerous
mistakes about who

1337
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:34,576
who is somebody

1338
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,578
when a woman
has a child

1339
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,081
before that child
is born

1340
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:43,085
she, she is somebody

1341
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,089
everybody is somebody

1342
01:08:47,124 --> 01:08:51,593
nobody is nobody

1343
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,596
i mean, apart
from all the wealthy

1344
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:56,098
doo doo doo doo doo

1345
01:08:56,598 --> 01:09:03,105
everybody is somebody

1346
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,607
yeah, oh, yeah

1347
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:13,615
everybody is somebody

1348
01:09:34,136 --> 01:09:36,638
all right, you guys,
forget it.

1349
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:38,640
All right, i got one.

1350
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,142
Who's this?

1351
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:43,145
People, move to the right
of the halls.

1352
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,147
Move expeditiously.

1353
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:47,149
Francesca,
come over here.

1354
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,650
How are you?

1355
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,152
Fine, mr. Clark.

1356
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:51,653
How's your sister?

1357
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,655
She broke her leg.

1358
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,157
That's good.

1359
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:58,160
You have any problem,
come to my office.

1360
01:09:58,195 --> 01:09:59,661
Here's the key.

1361
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,663
Ooh, that
ain't the key.

1362
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,665
Sams, sams.
Where's sams?

1363
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,667
Anybody see sams?

1364
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,170
Pull your pants up, son.

1365
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,671
Clarence, come here.

1366
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,173
Get your hormones
under control, boy.

1367
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,674
Let me feel your butt.

1368
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:13,675
Joe: Clarence.

1369
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,178
What do you think
you're doing?

1370
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:18,180
I was just...

1371
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,182
i was just, um...

1372
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,684
francesca,
come here.

1373
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,686
What is he doing?
Can he do me?

1374
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,688
Does he have
the juice?

1375
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:27,689
No way, mr. Clark.

1376
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,691
Clarence, report
to my office.

1377
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:32,194
Mr. Clark, i was
just fooling around.

1378
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,196
Got you.

1379
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:39,201
How do you learn the alphabet
? be on time

1380
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,204
come on, sams!
You can do it.

1381
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,205
...he's on time

1382
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:46,208
j-o-e c-l-a...

1383
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:47,709
don't give up!

1384
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,211
Fall in together,

1385
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:50,212
going "how do you like
the weather?"

1386
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:51,213
Going "how do you
learn the alphabet?"

1387
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,714
Be on time

1388
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,717
school bell ring
at a quarter to 9:00

1389
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,720
that's it, sams!
Stay with it, boy!

1390
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,222
...be on time

1391
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:02,224
"how do you learn
the alphabet?" be on time

1392
01:11:02,724 --> 01:11:04,726
how do you spell eastside
, eastside high?

1393
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,229
How do you spell joe clark?
He's on time

1394
01:11:07,264 --> 01:11:09,731
j-o-e c-l...

1395
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,234
holy cow!
I'm out of here.

1396
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,239
Clark can't even get them
past that test.

1397
01:11:17,739 --> 01:11:20,242
I thought we'd
settled this.

1398
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:23,245
With the doors chained,
that school's a firetrap.

1399
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:25,247
He's laughing at us.

1400
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:26,748
The man has
a legitimate problem.

1401
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,251
How does he keep drug pushers
out of his school

1402
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:32,254
if their buddies
can let them walk on in?

1403
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,256
He's got a point.

1404
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,758
This doesn't
concern you.

1405
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,761
Don, we can both
go to jail.

1406
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:42,264
By statute, we are
legally responsible.

1407
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:45,267
If a fire broke out
and a kid got hurt,

1408
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:47,269
they're going to
get trampled.

1409
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,272
A bunch
of savages anyway.

1410
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:51,273
Savages?

1411
01:11:51,308 --> 01:11:54,276
Don, can't you
control your men?

1412
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,777
Ladies and gentlemen,

1413
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,780
please leave me alone
with mrs. Barrett.

1414
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:02,284
Don, i want to
talk to you.

1415
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,786
I'll call you later
at your office.

1416
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:08,290
Thank you, frank.
Close the door, eh?

1417
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:17,299
I want to apologize for
the chief's use of language.

1418
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:20,802
I don't like
none of you people.

1419
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,804
Then let's cut through
the formalities.

1420
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,306
What do you want?

1421
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:25,807
Clark!

1422
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,810
Just like that.
Head on a platter.

1423
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,313
You think
i got an attitude.

1424
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,316
Let me tell you
what i think.

1425
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:37,319
You like clark
because he's a guard dog,

1426
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,821
does your dirty work,
keeps the black folk in line.

1427
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,823
That's fine, but you got
to get re-elected.

1428
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,826
I got enough folks
lined up with me

1429
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:48,830
to give you a damn hard time,
and i'll get more.

1430
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,332
Unless i do what?

1431
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:52,834
Appoint me
to the school board

1432
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,837
so we can
vote clark out.

1433
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,840
Otherwise we'll have to
vote you out.

1434
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,343
It's always a pleasure
to see citizens

1435
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,845
avail themselves of
the democratic process.

1436
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,847
My job will be easy.

1437
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,850
You're not too popular
these days, are you?

1438
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:13,855
I'll sic the fire chief
on clark.

1439
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,857
Will that satisfy you?

1440
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,861
Yes. And then i'll get
the school board to dismiss him.

1441
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,364
Then you'll come out
publicly for me.

1442
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,367
It'll be my pleasure,
mr. Mayor.

1443
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,873
That barrett
is a bitch on wheels.

1444
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,876
Smart. She's smart.

1445
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah. She got
your number.

1446
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,883
When am i supposed
to do this?

1447
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,897
Now we'd just
disrupt things.

1448
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:59,901
Give him another week
to prepare for that test.

1449
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:04,406
Then we'll catch him
with chains on the doors.

1450
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:05,907
We nail him,

1451
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,410
and we make her
happy.

1452
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:10,912
Politics.
What a business.

1453
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:15,417
It's just like yours,
putting out fires.

1454
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,765
The mayor's going to
nail me, huh?

1455
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,767
What do i
always say?

1456
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:33,769
He's got the hammer
and nails himself.

1457
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:34,770
These are some
of my white students.

1458
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,273
Frankie, bernard,
steve.

1459
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,276
Boys, this is mr. Rosenberg,
school attorney.

1460
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:45,280
Let him hear
the school song.

1461
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,285
Fair eastside

1462
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,287
by thy side
by thy side?

1463
01:14:52,322 --> 01:14:53,789
We'll stand
we'll stand?

1464
01:14:53,824 --> 01:14:57,292
And always
praise thy name-

1465
01:14:57,327 --> 01:14:58,794
all right!

1466
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:01,296
I can't stand this.
Needs work, fellas.

1467
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:02,798
Some things
you can't teach.

1468
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,800
Bad singing
isn't genetic.

1469
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:06,301
How's your mother?

1470
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,805
She got that job.
She's feeling good.

1471
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,807
Girls,
what are you doing?

1472
01:15:11,842 --> 01:15:14,810
The phone's broken.
My baby's sick.

1473
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:17,312
Make your call
from the office.

1474
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:19,314
When will you girls
learn?

1475
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,816
I ain't ashamed
about my baby.

1476
01:15:20,851 --> 01:15:22,317
Nobody's saying
you should be ashamed.

1477
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,319
And she ain't
ashamed of me.

1478
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:26,321
Whenever
she look at me,

1479
01:15:26,356 --> 01:15:27,823
she don't see
no wrong.

1480
01:15:27,858 --> 01:15:30,826
Ok. Go on and make
your call.

1481
01:15:30,861 --> 01:15:33,328
Mr. Vanzetti,
let these girls make a call.

1482
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,330
Hey, mr. Clark.

1483
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:38,834
We can't let them know
who told you.

1484
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:42,337
Why not?

1485
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,840
Mr. Clark,
we got a problem.

1486
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:47,342
How come
you leave us out?

1487
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:49,344
Everything's
for the black kids.

1488
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:51,346
The gospel chorus,
football, basketball

1489
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,348
is for the blacks.

1490
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,851
I'm short. I can't
play basketball.

1491
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:57,853
The point is,
you're ignoring us.

1492
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:58,854
We're getting
really ticked off.

1493
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:00,355
With a mouth
like yours,

1494
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,357
you ought to
study law.

1495
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:03,358
Really?

1496
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:06,361
You kids wait for me
in my office.

1497
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,864
If you all talk
at once,

1498
01:16:08,899 --> 01:16:10,365
i can't do anything.

1499
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,368
I'll be with you ladies
in a minute.

1500
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,371
Boss, you and mr. Rosenberg
better wait out here.

1501
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:19,875
Miss lynn,
give markus a pass.

1502
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,378
Ms. Levias,
is everyone here?

1503
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,880
Yes, sir.

1504
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:26,882
Let me have
your attention.

1505
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:29,384
With the help of my ubiquitous,
clandestine informants

1506
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,887
i have learned that the mayor
has told the fire chief

1507
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:34,389
to catch me
with chains on the doors.

1508
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:38,393
They want to prosecute me
and get me out of here.

1509
01:16:38,428 --> 01:16:41,396
The security guards are
our first line of defense.

1510
01:16:41,431 --> 01:16:45,901
If you see the fire chief,
stop him at the gates.

1511
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:48,904
Call in code 10
on your walkie-talkies.

1512
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:52,407
We will repeat code 10
on the p.a. System.

1513
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:55,911
All teachers and guards
have keys to the exit doors.

1514
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:57,913
When you hear code 10,

1515
01:16:57,948 --> 01:17:02,918
proceed to your assigned door
and remove the chains.

1516
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:06,421
Guards, resume your posts.
Ms. Levias, take over.

1517
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,925
Tell those kids in my office
to meet me here 7th period.

1518
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:11,927
How did it go?

1519
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:14,429
It's under control.

1520
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:16,431
I have
the progress report

1521
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,433
on the reading
program.

1522
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:21,436
I thought you'd
like to hear it.

1523
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:22,938
I would like to hear it.

1524
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:26,441
I'd also like to hear
the kids in my office,

1525
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:27,943
and mr. Rosenberg,
and dr. Napier.

1526
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,945
I can't be 10 different
places at the same time.

1527
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:34,449
Maybe my vice principal can do
something without me for once.

1528
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:38,453
Mr. Clark.

1529
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:40,455
I'll help you
7th period.

1530
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:47,462
Excuse me.

1531
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:58,139
Good night,
mr. Clark.

1532
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,141
Good night.

1533
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,145
Mr. Clark.

1534
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,147
Yes, ms. Levias.

1535
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:10,151
May i talk to you
for a minute, please?

1536
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,653
What do you want?

1537
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,655
I want you
to transfer me.

1538
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,156
To where?

1539
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,658
Out of here.

1540
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,159
This doesn't
surprise me.

1541
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:22,163
I've sensed resistance in you
since our very first meeting.

1542
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:25,166
You're an egomaniacal
windbag.

1543
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:26,668
Who you talking to?
You!

1544
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:29,671
You like to whip people
who can't fight back.

1545
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,673
I thought i could take it
because i had a father

1546
01:18:32,173 --> 01:18:33,174
in the same kind of pain

1547
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,175
that makes you
such a bastard,

1548
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,176
but i was wrong.
Life is much too short.

1549
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,180
I will not endure you
any longer.

1550
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,683
The only reason
i haven't walked out

1551
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:44,185
and half the staff
with me

1552
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,688
is because
those children need us.

1553
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:48,690
You're so busy
talking discipline,

1554
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,191
you forget to educate.

1555
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:53,194
What the hell do you think
i've been doing here?

1556
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:56,197
You cleaned it up.
That was easy.

1557
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,700
Those children
want to be helped.

1558
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:00,201
They've done everything
we've asked,

1559
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,703
but i feel
sorry for them.

1560
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,705
They're not ready
to take that test.

1561
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,207
What the hell
are you talking about?

1562
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,209
I have done everything-

1563
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,211
i. It is always i.

1564
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,714
There are 300
teachers here.

1565
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:14,215
You don't
do it alone.

1566
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,719
I don't have to listen
to these accusations.

1567
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,721
Youwilllisten!

1568
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:23,224
All right, ms. Levias,
go ahead and talk.

1569
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:24,726
You've been flapping
your mouth,

1570
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:26,227
and you haven't
heard a thing.

1571
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,729
You haven't seen what's
painfully obvious.

1572
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,231
I'll tell you what-

1573
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,233
no, let me finish!

1574
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:35,236
Everybody here
may not like you,

1575
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,739
but we all applaud
your effort.

1576
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:39,741
What you don't
understand

1577
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,744
is the same people
who support you

1578
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:45,246
are the ones
you're beating up!

1579
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,749
You don't even
say thank you.

1580
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:49,751
You just constantly
abuse them,

1581
01:19:49,786 --> 01:19:51,252
criticize them.

1582
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,756
What the hell
do you want from me?

1583
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,759
I want you
to get this straight.

1584
01:19:57,794 --> 01:20:01,262
Most of the teachers are
here because they care

1585
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,765
about those children,
this school, this fight.

1586
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,267
They're in it with you.

1587
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,268
They take it home
the same as you.

1588
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:09,270
They are part of those
children's lives.

1589
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,273
You are thoughtless
and cruel,

1590
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,775
and it hurts.

1591
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,277
And none of them
deserve it.

1592
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,781
They are sick of it,
and so am i.

1593
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:44,305
Ms. Levias.

1594
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,807
What's this?

1595
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:47,809
The transfer
you asked for.

1596
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,324
All right, people.
Here we are.

1597
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,826
This is the day.

1598
01:21:05,326 --> 01:21:06,327
In one hour,

1599
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:10,331
you're going to take an exam
administered by the state

1600
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,333
to test your basic skills

1601
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,336
and the quality of education
at eastside high.

1602
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:18,339
And i want to tell you

1603
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:21,342
what the people out there
are saying about you

1604
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,344
and what they think
about your chances.

1605
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:25,346
They say you are inferior.

1606
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:26,347
Come on!

1607
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:27,849
Come on!

1608
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:29,851
Come on! Come on!

1609
01:21:31,352 --> 01:21:36,357
"You are just a bunch of niggers
and spics and poor white trash."

1610
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,361
"Education is wasted on you."

1611
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:43,865
"You cannot learn!"

1612
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,868
You're lost!

1613
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:50,872
I mean all of you.

1614
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:54,375
I want all the white students
to stand up.

1615
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,878
All my white students,
stand up.

1616
01:21:56,913 --> 01:21:58,379
Come on.

1617
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,381
Stand up.
Stand up.

1618
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,884
That's it.
Come on, stand up.

1619
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:05,887
These are my white children,

1620
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:08,890
and they're the same
as all of you.

1621
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:10,892
They've got no place to go.

1622
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:14,896
Otherwise, they would have
abandoned us a long time ago,

1623
01:22:14,931 --> 01:22:17,398
but they couldn't.

1624
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:21,402
So here they are at eastside,
just like the rest of us.

1625
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,404
You can sit down.

1626
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,907
Are you getting my point,
people?

1627
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:26,908
Yes!

1628
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,409
Is it sinking in?

1629
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,911
Yes!

1630
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:32,413
We sink, we swim.

1631
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:34,415
We rise, we fall.

1632
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,918
We meet our fate together!

1633
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:47,929
Now, it took the help
of a good, good friend

1634
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:50,932
to make me know
and understand that,

1635
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:53,935
and i do understand it,
and i'm grateful.

1636
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:56,437
I'm eternally grateful.

1637
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,944
And i've got a message
for those people out there

1638
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:05,947
who've abandoned you
and written you off.

1639
01:23:06,447 --> 01:23:08,449
Can you hear me?

1640
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,450
Yes!

1641
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,952
Can you hear me?

1642
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:12,453
Yes!

1643
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:13,454
Good!

1644
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:15,957
You are not inferior!

1645
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,463
Your grades may be.

1646
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,465
Your school may have been.

1647
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,968
But you can turn that around

1648
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:29,971
and make liars
out of those bastards

1649
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:31,472
in exactly one hour!

1650
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,976
You'll take that test,
pass it, and win!

1651
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,986
So here's what
i want you to do.

1652
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,990
When you find
your minds wandering,

1653
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:52,493
i want you to knuckle back down
and concentrate.

1654
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,996
Concentrate!

1655
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:56,497
Remember what's at stake

1656
01:23:56,532 --> 01:24:00,001
and show them what eastside high
is all about-

1657
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:03,004
a spirit that will not die!

1658
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:25,576
Sometimes in our lives

1659
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:28,079
we all have pain

1660
01:24:28,114 --> 01:24:33,084
we all have sorrow

1661
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:37,088
but if we are wise

1662
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:43,594
we know that there's
always tomorrow

1663
01:24:43,629 --> 01:24:45,596
lean on me

1664
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:48,099
when you're not strong

1665
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:51,102
and i'll be your friend?

1666
01:24:51,137 --> 01:24:55,606
I'll help you carry on

1667
01:24:55,641 --> 01:24:59,110
for it won't be long

1668
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:02,113
till i'm gonna need

1669
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:06,117
somebody to lean on

1670
01:25:06,152 --> 01:25:08,619
you just call
on me, brother

1671
01:25:08,654 --> 01:25:11,122
when you need a hand

1672
01:25:11,622 --> 01:25:16,627
we all need somebody
to lean on

1673
01:25:16,662 --> 01:25:19,630
i just might have a problem?

1674
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:21,632
That you'll understand

1675
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:26,137
we all need somebody
to lean on

1676
01:25:26,172 --> 01:25:29,140
why don't you
lean on me?

1677
01:25:29,175 --> 01:25:31,642
Lean on me

1678
01:25:31,677 --> 01:25:33,644
if you need a friend

1679
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,647
you can lean on me

1680
01:25:36,682 --> 01:25:38,649
i'll be your friend

1681
01:25:38,684 --> 01:25:39,650
lean on me

1682
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:41,652
you can lean on me

1683
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:43,154
come on
and lean on me

1684
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:44,155
lean on me

1685
01:25:44,655 --> 01:25:47,158
you can lean on me

1686
01:25:47,193 --> 01:25:51,662
please, won't you
swallow your pride?

1687
01:25:51,697 --> 01:25:54,165
If i have things

1688
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:58,169
you need to borrow

1689
01:25:58,204 --> 01:26:04,675
for no one can fill
those of your needs

1690
01:26:04,710 --> 01:26:07,178
that you won't let go

1691
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:09,680
why don't you
just lean on?

1692
01:26:09,715 --> 01:26:10,681
Anytime

1693
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:12,683
lean on

1694
01:26:12,718 --> 01:26:13,684
come on and lean on

1695
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:16,687
lean on me,
you can lean on me

1696
01:26:16,722 --> 01:26:18,689
if you need a friend

1697
01:26:18,724 --> 01:26:19,690
lean on me

1698
01:26:20,191 --> 01:26:21,692
you can lean on me

1699
01:26:21,727 --> 01:26:24,195
and if you got a problem

1700
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:27,198
you can lean on me

1701
01:26:27,233 --> 01:26:29,700
i'm your problem solver?

1702
01:26:29,735 --> 01:26:31,702
You can lean on me

1703
01:26:31,737 --> 01:26:33,204
why don't you lean?

1704
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:34,205
Lean on me

1705
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,707
uh-huh

1706
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:39,210
come on and lean on me

1707
01:26:39,245 --> 01:26:41,212
you can lean on me

1708
01:26:41,247 --> 01:26:43,214
call on me, brother

1709
01:26:43,249 --> 01:26:44,715
you can lean on me

1710
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:47,718
sister, give me your hand

1711
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:50,721
lean on me,
you can lean on me

1712
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:52,223
you can, you can, you can

1713
01:26:52,258 --> 01:26:55,226
lean on me,
you can lean on me

1714
01:26:55,726 --> 01:26:56,727
swallow up your pride

1715
01:26:57,228 --> 01:27:00,231
lean on me,
you can lean on...

1716
01:27:00,266 --> 01:27:04,235
please, children, people

1717
01:27:04,270 --> 01:27:10,241
lean on me, oh

1718
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:19,750
eastside!

1719
01:27:19,785 --> 01:27:21,252
Eastside! Eastside!

1720
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:24,755
Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside!

1721
01:27:25,256 --> 01:27:26,757
Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside!

1722
01:27:27,258 --> 01:27:30,211
Eastside! Eastside! Eastside!
Eastside...

1723
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:49,730
dum dum-dum-dum-dum

1724
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:52,233
dum-dum-dum-dum

1725
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:55,736
dum-dum-dum dum-dum

1726
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:57,738
dum-dum

1727
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,741
sometimes in our lives

1728
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:03,244
we all have pain

1729
01:28:03,744 --> 01:28:07,248
we all have sorrow

1730
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:08,249
dum-dum-dum

1731
01:28:08,284 --> 01:28:11,752
but if we are wise

1732
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:18,259
we know that there's
always tomorrow

1733
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:20,094
i told you
these things take time.

1734
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:23,097
Just how long
am i supposed to wait?

1735
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:26,100
You boys are messing
with the wrong female.

1736
01:28:26,135 --> 01:28:28,102
He won't
let me in.

1737
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:29,604
What's
going on?

1738
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,606
Would you
talk to her?

1739
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,609
I thought
we had made a deal.

1740
01:28:34,644 --> 01:28:37,111
Don't broadcast it
all over town.

1741
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:39,614
I have got a school board
meeting tonight

1742
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:42,116
and enough votes
to get clark kicked out

1743
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:43,618
if i can prove
he's chained those doors.

1744
01:28:43,653 --> 01:28:47,622
We can get that
if you move on him today.

1745
01:28:47,657 --> 01:28:49,123
Chief gaines
already tried that.

1746
01:28:49,158 --> 01:28:51,626
Bullshit! I've made
promises of my own.

1747
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:53,127
I've got people
with me right now.

1748
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:55,129
If i can't deliver-

1749
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:56,631
just a minute.

1750
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:59,634
And i do not issue
idle threats.

1751
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:03,638
Then don't, because
i don't want to hear it.

1752
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,142
Ok, chief.

1753
01:29:08,177 --> 01:29:10,645
Mrs. Barrett was
promised some action.

1754
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,148
I think it's time
we get a court order

1755
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:16,651
and get you past
those guards.

1756
01:29:16,686 --> 01:29:18,152
Sounds good to me.

1757
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,656
He ain't
worth it.

1758
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:22,657
Jerk.

1759
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:24,659
That's right.
He's a jerk.

1760
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:26,160
I told you that.

1761
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,162
You don't listen
to me.

1762
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:31,666
What are you two ladies
doing in here?

1763
01:29:31,701 --> 01:29:36,170
Lillian, aren't you supposed
to be in class?

1764
01:29:36,205 --> 01:29:38,172
Huh?

1765
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,174
Kaneesha?

1766
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,176
What's going on
here?

1767
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,177
Lillian?

1768
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:44,679
What is
this?

1769
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:46,681
You'll have to
ask her.

1770
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:49,183
Kaneesha,
what's the matter?

1771
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,187
I got pregnant.

1772
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,193
Please don't
be mad at me.

1773
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,197
Let me talk
to her alone.

1774
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,207
Did you tell
your mother?

1775
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:15,710
I can't.

1776
01:30:16,711 --> 01:30:18,212
Reggie's
the father?

1777
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:20,214
He says it's not his,
but i know it is.

1778
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:23,217
I've never been
with no other boys.

1779
01:30:23,252 --> 01:30:26,220
I never meant
for this to happen.

1780
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:27,722
You girls never do.

1781
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:31,726
So many of you bringing
babies into this world

1782
01:30:31,761 --> 01:30:34,729
just to prove you can
accomplish something.

1783
01:30:34,764 --> 01:30:37,732
And you're doing
so well now, kaneesha.

1784
01:30:37,767 --> 01:30:39,734
There are other
alternatives.

1785
01:30:39,769 --> 01:30:42,236
I'm scared.
I don't know what to do.

1786
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:44,739
I'll tell you
what we'll do.

1787
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:47,742
We'll have your mother
come to the school.

1788
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,744
We'll put our heads
together.

1789
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:53,247
I'm sure we'll be able
to help you decide

1790
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:57,218
what's best for you
to do. Trust me?

1791
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:58,586
Mr. Clark!

1792
01:30:58,621 --> 01:31:01,088
8:00 a.m.
I'll call your mother.

1793
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,590
What is it?

1794
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,091
The fire chief.

1795
01:31:04,126 --> 01:31:06,093
He got past
the gate.

1796
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:09,096
Code 10! Get those
chains off the door!

1797
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,098
The enemy's
here!

1798
01:31:11,133 --> 01:31:13,601
We got it locked,
mr. Clark.

1799
01:31:15,102 --> 01:31:17,605
Mr. Clark,
you're under arrest.

1800
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:21,609
For what?

1801
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,611
Basically
for being an asshole.

1802
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:26,113
Specifically for conspiracy
to violate of the fire code.

1803
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:27,615
I got no problem
with the fire code.

1804
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,116
The only problem here
is you.

1805
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:31,118
And your problem
is your mouth.

1806
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:33,621
Joe: Get those chains
off the doors!

1807
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:35,122
The enemy's here!

1808
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:38,125
Guard: We got it
locked, mr. Clark.

1809
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,627
Cuff him!

1810
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:43,130
Hey, mr. Clark!

1811
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:45,633
What's this
all about?

1812
01:31:45,668 --> 01:31:49,136
It's about someone finally
standing up to this man

1813
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:52,139
instead of taking
his orders like a maid.

1814
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,642
How dare you
speak like that!

1815
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:55,643
Mrs. Barrett-

1816
01:31:55,678 --> 01:31:57,144
shut up!
You're finished!

1817
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,146
The school board
will hear this at 7:00,

1818
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:02,650
and we'll vote
your black ass out.

1819
01:32:02,685 --> 01:32:03,651
Yo, bitch,
vote on this!

1820
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:05,152
You go to class!

1821
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,154
You're
acting principal now.

1822
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:10,157
I expect you
to perform as i would.

1823
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,159
What-
what's going on?

1824
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:14,161
What did you
do?

1825
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:15,663
I chained the doors.

1826
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:18,666
You break the law,
you pay the price.

1827
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:28,175
We still got to
go to class?

1828
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:32,179
Yes. All of you,
get back to class! Now!

1829
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:33,681
Mr. Clark...

1830
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:35,182
go on!

1831
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:37,685
Who will look
after the school?

1832
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,687
Go on!
Get back to class!

1833
01:32:39,722 --> 01:32:43,691
Get back in there,
all of you! Go on!

1834
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:46,193
Ms. Levias,
they're your responsibility!

1835
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:03,711
I guess we ought to
be getting out of here, joe.

1836
01:33:03,746 --> 01:33:06,714
That school board meeting's
about to begin.

1837
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:10,217
Do whatever we can.

1838
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:15,222
Have you thought about
a new line of work?

1839
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,726
Perhaps an exciting career
in electronics?

1840
01:33:20,227 --> 01:33:22,730
It's just
a little joke.

1841
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,733
I'm going.

1842
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:37,244
I've got
no complaints, joe.

1843
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,246
As far
as i'm concerned,

1844
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:42,249
what you accomplished
down at that school

1845
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:44,251
was a goddamn miracle.

1846
01:33:44,286 --> 01:33:47,755
Those kids have a light
in their eyes now

1847
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:52,259
that was never,
never there before.

1848
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,263
Thanks, boss.

1849
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:04,271
You know, i'm always
trying to teach my kids

1850
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,273
to stay out of jail.

1851
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:09,777
Look at me.

1852
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:13,280
You go on.

1853
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,283
Do what you got to do.

1854
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,763
He has failed
at his professional task.

1855
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:32,766
We brought him in
to save our school

1856
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,269
from a takeover
from the state.

1857
01:34:35,304 --> 01:34:38,272
That was the mandate
from our mayor.

1858
01:34:38,307 --> 01:34:41,275
But the test scores
on the practice exam

1859
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:43,277
were 35% below passing.

1860
01:34:44,313 --> 01:34:47,281
Now, maybe
if we dump him now

1861
01:34:47,316 --> 01:34:49,783
and get a new principal
ourselves-

1862
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:52,786
show the state
that we're doing something-

1863
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:54,788
we can pre-empt
the takeover,

1864
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:57,791
but only if we get him out

1865
01:34:57,826 --> 01:35:00,294
before those final
test scores come back.

1866
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:02,796
After that,
it'll be too late.

1867
01:35:03,297 --> 01:35:05,299
This board won't
have any power.

1868
01:35:05,334 --> 01:35:08,302
It'll be nothing
but a rubber stamp.

1869
01:35:09,338 --> 01:35:13,307
Mrs. Arthur,
those are the facts.

1870
01:35:13,342 --> 01:35:17,311
I appreciate your personal
loyalty to mr. Clark,

1871
01:35:17,346 --> 01:35:19,313
but he has let
our children down,

1872
01:35:19,348 --> 01:35:21,815
and our loyalty
should be to them.

1873
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:25,319
Our loyalty should be
to the man we hired.

1874
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:29,323
Order! Order!

1875
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:53,847
Free mr. Clark!

1876
01:35:54,348 --> 01:36:07,361
Free mr. Clark!

1877
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:10,864
Free mr. Clark!

1878
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:12,866
Napier: Order,
ladies and gentlemen!

1879
01:36:14,868 --> 01:36:15,869
Order, please!

1880
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:17,871
We cannot continue
this meeting

1881
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:20,374
with this kind
of chaos! Please!

1882
01:36:20,874 --> 01:36:22,376
Sit down!
Come to order!

1883
01:36:22,411 --> 01:36:24,878
Dr. Napier,
dr. Napier,

1884
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:29,383
i think you should
call the question now.

1885
01:36:29,418 --> 01:36:31,385
I cannot call
the question.

1886
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:34,388
All points of view seem
to have been exhausted here.

1887
01:36:34,423 --> 01:36:36,890
No further purpose
will be served by this.

1888
01:36:36,925 --> 01:36:39,893
Why don't you have
someone on the board-

1889
01:36:39,928 --> 01:36:42,896
mr. Clark's students
have assembled outside

1890
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:45,899
in an exercise of their
first amendment rights.

1891
01:36:45,934 --> 01:36:47,401
How many?

1892
01:36:47,436 --> 01:36:49,403
It looks like
all of them.

1893
01:36:49,903 --> 01:36:50,904
Free mr. Clark!

1894
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:56,910
Free mr. Clark!

1895
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,919
We're in a tough spot here.

1896
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:08,922
I have to ask
your help, joe.

1897
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:11,425
It's not for me.
It's for those kids.

1898
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:14,428
They're very emotional.
They're all jacked up.

1899
01:37:14,463 --> 01:37:15,429
You have
to send them home.

1900
01:37:15,929 --> 01:37:19,933
I don't have to do nothing
but stay black and die.

1901
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:21,935
For crying out loud.

1902
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:23,437
Free mr. Clark!

1903
01:37:23,937 --> 01:37:24,938
Free mr. Clark!

1904
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:26,440
Free mr. Clark!

1905
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:27,941
Free mr. Clark!

1906
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:31,945
Free mr. Clark!

1907
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,948
People, before
this gets out of hand,

1908
01:37:34,983 --> 01:37:37,951
listen, for your own safety,
listen to me!

1909
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:39,453
Free mr. Clark!

1910
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:43,957
Free mr. Clark!

1911
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:47,461
All right, joe.
Let me put it this way.

1912
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:49,963
First, i wanted you
to succeed.

1913
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:53,467
Now, don't think that i
ever wanted anything else.

1914
01:37:53,502 --> 01:37:56,470
But you're a realist,
joe, just like me.

1915
01:37:56,505 --> 01:37:58,472
Think what
would happen

1916
01:37:58,507 --> 01:38:00,474
if there was a riot

1917
01:38:00,509 --> 01:38:03,477
and cops had to
clear that square.

1918
01:38:03,512 --> 01:38:06,480
I'd have law and order
on my side,

1919
01:38:06,515 --> 01:38:08,982
and the only people
who'd be hurt

1920
01:38:09,017 --> 01:38:11,485
would be your kids.

1921
01:38:11,885 --> 01:38:12,853
Free mr. Clark!

1922
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:14,354
Free mr. Clark!

1923
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:15,856
Free mr. Clark!

1924
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:17,357
Free mr. Clark!

1925
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:19,359
Free mr. Clark!

1926
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,861
Listen to me!

1927
01:38:20,896 --> 01:38:22,863
People, please!

1928
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:26,867
You must all disperse
and return to your homes!

1929
01:38:27,367 --> 01:38:29,870
Your presence here
is helping no one.

1930
01:38:29,905 --> 01:38:32,873
Why don't you use your brains
and listen?

1931
01:38:32,908 --> 01:38:38,378
Free mr. Clark!

1932
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:44,384
Thank you.

1933
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:45,886
Listen up.

1934
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:48,388
Settle down. Give her
a chance to talk.

1935
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,891
She might actually
have something to say.

1936
01:38:50,926 --> 01:38:51,892
Chill. Settle down.

1937
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:54,394
Let's listen to the old
loudmouthed wench.

1938
01:38:56,396 --> 01:38:57,898
Here you go,
barrett.

1939
01:38:57,933 --> 01:38:59,399
Here you go.

1940
01:39:01,902 --> 01:39:04,905
You can call me
what you want,

1941
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,874
but the simple fact is

1942
01:39:06,909 --> 01:39:10,377
mr. Clark has broken the laws
of this state

1943
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:13,380
and exposed you all
to grave danger.

1944
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:19,887
His behavior
is irresponsible.

1945
01:39:19,922 --> 01:39:22,890
Chaining those doors
was a criminal act.

1946
01:39:22,925 --> 01:39:24,892
Why do you think
they call him "crazy joe"?

1947
01:39:24,927 --> 01:39:27,895
Because you don't
understand him.

1948
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:29,396
Yeah.
That's right.

1949
01:39:29,431 --> 01:39:31,398
He chained
those doors

1950
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:33,901
to keep out
the drug dealers.

1951
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:35,903
You're twisting
the law.

1952
01:39:35,938 --> 01:39:38,906
The laws are made
to protect the people.

1953
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:41,408
That's what
he's doing for us.

1954
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:42,910
Yes!

1955
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:46,413
The thing that
you don't understand

1956
01:39:46,448 --> 01:39:49,416
is that mr. Clark
believes in us.

1957
01:39:49,451 --> 01:39:51,418
He doesn't
believe in you!

1958
01:39:51,453 --> 01:39:52,419
You don't
take care

1959
01:39:52,454 --> 01:39:54,421
of your
responsibility!

1960
01:39:54,456 --> 01:39:57,925
Despite what he himself
may believe,

1961
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,427
mr. Clark is not
eastside high!

1962
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:03,430
Mr. Clark is not
only eastside high.

1963
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:05,933
Mr. Clark is
like a father,

1964
01:40:05,968 --> 01:40:08,936
the only father
some of us know.

1965
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:10,437
You don't
know a thing

1966
01:40:10,472 --> 01:40:11,939
about mr. Clark!

1967
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:13,941
People!
People, just hear me!

1968
01:40:13,976 --> 01:40:16,944
The school board
is meeting right now,

1969
01:40:16,979 --> 01:40:20,447
and we will give you
what eastside high deserves-

1970
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:21,949
a good principal.

1971
01:40:21,984 --> 01:40:24,451
We don't want
a good principal!

1972
01:40:24,486 --> 01:40:26,453
We want mr. Clark!

1973
01:40:26,488 --> 01:40:29,456
You may think you know
what you want,

1974
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:32,960
but the question is
what is best for you,

1975
01:40:32,995 --> 01:40:34,428
for eastside high.

1976
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:36,830
This thing's getting
out of hand.

1977
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:38,832
Talk to them,
please.

1978
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,835
...to see
that this gets resolved

1979
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:44,838
so that you can
continue your education.

1980
01:40:44,873 --> 01:40:49,843
Free mr. Clark!

1981
01:40:49,878 --> 01:40:51,845
People! People...

1982
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:03,857
yay!

1983
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:05,859
All right!

1984
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:15,369
I wonder why i can't get
this kind of turnout

1985
01:41:15,404 --> 01:41:16,870
for study hall.

1986
01:41:19,408 --> 01:41:20,874
All right, now.

1987
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:23,377
Kids, this is
all very nice,

1988
01:41:23,412 --> 01:41:27,881
but now i'm going to insist
that you all go home

1989
01:41:27,916 --> 01:41:30,884
and let the laws
of the land prevail.

1990
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:31,885
No!

1991
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,387
No! No! No!

1992
01:41:33,887 --> 01:41:34,888
No! No! No!

1993
01:41:34,923 --> 01:41:36,390
Now, listen.

1994
01:41:36,425 --> 01:41:37,391
Listen.

1995
01:41:37,426 --> 01:41:40,394
If i've taught you
anything,

1996
01:41:40,429 --> 01:41:44,398
i have tried to give you
respect for the law.

1997
01:41:44,433 --> 01:41:47,401
Now, i want you all
to go home

1998
01:41:47,436 --> 01:41:49,403
in an orderly fashion!

1999
01:41:49,438 --> 01:41:51,405
No! No! No!

2000
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,907
Your voices have been heard!

2001
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:57,411
No! No! No!

2002
01:41:57,446 --> 01:42:01,415
I appreciate
your concern for me.

2003
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:02,916
No! No! No!

2004
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:05,419
But now is the time
to go home.

2005
01:42:05,454 --> 01:42:07,421
No! No! No!

2006
01:42:07,456 --> 01:42:10,424
Kids, listen. You're not
helping the matters any.

2007
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,426
You're not helping
our cause

2008
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,428
if you stay here.

2009
01:42:14,463 --> 01:42:15,929
No! No! No!

2010
01:42:15,964 --> 01:42:18,932
I thought i left you
in charge of these students.

2011
01:42:18,967 --> 01:42:20,934
You got to
read this.

2012
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:23,937
Is this taking care
of your responsibility?

2013
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:25,439
Read it!

2014
01:42:25,474 --> 01:42:28,942
No! No! No!

2015
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:30,444
No! No! No!

2016
01:42:30,944 --> 01:42:31,945
No! No! No!

2017
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:33,447
No! No! No!

2018
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:34,948
No! No! No!

2019
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:35,949
Boss.

2020
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,451
No! No! No!

2021
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:38,952
No! No! No!

2022
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:40,454
No! No! No!

2023
01:42:40,954 --> 01:42:44,958
Dr. Napier,
it is my duty-

2024
01:42:45,459 --> 01:42:49,463
it is my privilege
and my honor to report to you

2025
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:51,965
that the students
of eastside high

2026
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:55,469
have passed the minimum
basic skills test!

2027
01:43:20,994 --> 01:43:21,995
Mr. Mayor.

2028
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:23,997
Boy: Yeah!
All right!

2029
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:25,999
Go get him!

2030
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:28,502
Mr. Mayor,
on behalf of myself

2031
01:43:28,537 --> 01:43:33,006
and on behalf of the students
of eastside high,

2032
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:36,510
you can tell the state
to go to hell.

2033
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:44,518
I told you.

2034
01:43:44,553 --> 01:43:47,521
You should not
have brought him here...

2035
01:43:47,556 --> 01:43:51,525
joe louis clark
is not going anywhere.

2036
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:57,030
Are you ready,
my ghosts?

2037
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:58,031
Yes!

2038
01:43:58,066 --> 01:44:00,033
Let me hear it.

2039
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:03,036
1, 2, 3!

2040
01:44:03,071 --> 01:44:06,039
Fair eastside

2041
01:44:06,074 --> 01:44:08,542
by thy side we'll stand?

2042
01:44:08,577 --> 01:44:13,046
And always praise thy name

2043
01:44:13,081 --> 01:44:18,051
to ever
lend our hearts and hands

2044
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:19,052
congratulations.

2045
01:44:19,087 --> 01:44:21,054
Come on, son.

01:44:21,089 --> 01:44:23,557

01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:32,566

2074
01:46:04,743 --> 01:46:06,710
you have to bear

2075
01:46:06,745 --> 01:46:11,214
that you can't carry

2076
01:46:11,249 --> 01:46:12,716
