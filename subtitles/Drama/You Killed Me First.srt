"She knew a trick.

5
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:34,574
"She knew how to turn her life into a movie
and watch things happen.

6
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,443
"Not to her,
but to a girl who looked just like her.

7
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,819
"Was she the runaway

8
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:46,687
"with everything she owned
in a ratty old backpack?

9
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:51,023
"Or, was she watching a movie about
a hitchhiking runaway on a lonely highway?

10
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,957
"A truck slowed till the girl squinted
in his headlights.

11
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,357
"But one good look at her

12
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,594
"and the trucker couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

13
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,530
"She didn't even have the strength
to curse him

14
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:06,903
"as she choked on the dust
of his spinning wheels."

15
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Norquist.
I know I should have this by now.

16
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:05,344
You've been distracted lately, Aubrey.

17
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:10,153
The next Young Artist Competition
is less than a month away.

18
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,484
I know. I know.

19
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,658
Watch this hand.

20
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,113
You see how easy?

21
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:38,974
Yeah.

22
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,047
I've been meaning to talk to you.

23
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,484
You know, I've been thinking, and...

24
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:50,014
I just... I don't know if I'm cut out
to play piano anymore.

25
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:54,859
Aubrey, all artists feel that way. It's normal.

26
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,431
No, I... I want to quit.

27
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,668
I mean, I barely made my winter admit
to Yale, and I could still blow it.

28
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,661
I just need to concentrate
all of my efforts into writing.

29
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,831
But you have a gift, an innate talent.

30
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,170
You won the Young Artist Competition.

31
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,904
I mean, how much more validation
do you need?

32
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,673
That was a long time ago, Mr. Norquist.

33
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,683
Hi, you.

34
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,165
<i>" She always felt like half a person.</i>

35
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,601
<i>" Half a person with half a soul.</i>

36
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:31,198
<i>" Sometimes, if she dreamed hard enough,
she could bring the two halves together.</i>

37
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:35,369
<i>" But she always woke to the same feelings
of loneliness and loss. "</i>

38
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:46,413
- Hey.
- Hi.

39
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,821
Where'd you find a blue rose?

40
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:52,323
I passed a place on the street. Here.

41
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,723
Thank you.

42
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,225
You okay?

43
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,992
Yeah.

44
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:05,362
Got me.

45
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,907
Sheriff, several federal agents
were seen entering city hall

46
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:26,452
- about an hour ago.
- Why has the coroner's report been sealed?

47
00:08:26,554 --> 00:08:27,781
- Sheriff! Jennifer Toland...
- Please.

48
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:28,911
...disappeared almost two months ago.

49
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,649
Serial killers typically...

50
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:33,316
We have one dead girl,
and you're talking serial killer!

51
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,553
- You people astound me.
- Could you just give us a name?

52
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:40,092
Who has not yet found the aortic arches?

53
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,233
And the super-pharyngeal ganglia?

54
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,328
The brain.

55
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,698
Yes, you can barely see that,
even under the microscope.

56
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:55,936
Is that all I am to you?

57
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:58,069
Just something to relax you
before the game?

58
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,874
If I cut a worm in half,
will it become two worms?

59
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:03,142
No, Pete, that's a myth.

60
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:07,718
What's it gonna take for me and you
to be together?

61
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,879
A lot more than one blue rose.

62
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:12,980
Aubrey, I think I'm falling in love with you.

63
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:17,050
We barely know each other, Jerrod.

64
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,220
- You're delusional.
- No, I'm not.

65
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,197
I've never felt this way about a girl before.

66
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:23,697
- I just keep thinking about you and...
- Jerrod!

67
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,463
Can you point out for me
the female reproductive organs?

68
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,598
The seminal receptacles.

69
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,502
Yes, I can, actually.

70
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,702
That should be it.

71
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:44,106
Those would be
the male reproductive organs.

72
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,750
The female organs are at the other end
of the worm.

73
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,449
Looks like you need a little more experience
in the female anatomy.

74
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:01,028
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

75
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:13,539
Jennifer Toland's body was discovered
early this morning.

76
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,505
Please don't ask me any questions.
I don't have the details.

77
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,016
<i>Nineteen-year-old female, 5'4 " tall.</i>

78
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:38,753
<i>Amputation of individual digits,</i>

79
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,489
<i>possibly on the same or successive days.</i>

80
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:47,098
<i>Full metacarpal amputation
approximately two weeks later.</i>

81
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:53,664
<i>Ragged cuts indicate</i>

82
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:59,507
<i>near-lethal levels of amphetamines
inducing a state of forced alertness,</i>

83
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:03,479
<i>suggesting the killer wanted the victim</i>

84
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:06,380
<i>fully conscious during each limb removal.</i>

85
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:26,608
<i>As we all know,
Jennifer Toland's body was found this week.</i>

86
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,082
<i>And we'd like to take a moment of silence.</i>

87
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,124
<i>Now, let's get out there
and win this one for Jennifer Toland!</i>

88
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:54,137
Come on!

89
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:39,499
<i>Curfew is one hour away.</i>

90
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,739
<i>Attention, curfew, for under 21,
begins in one hour.</i>

91
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:47,640
Why are you...

92
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,546
Just marry him
and start popping out babies.

93
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,676
No way. I'm done sleeping with guys
I'm not in love with.

94
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:55,687
Oh, like you were some kind
of a sex addict before.

95
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:57,050
But Jerrod loves you.

96
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:01,855
I'll be 3,000 miles away in January.
I mean, I can't afford to fall in love.

97
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:02,927
That's nice.

98
00:14:03,028 --> 00:14:07,021
<i>It's like someone could stab you
and you'd never even know what...</i>

99
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,497
It's like Mardi Gras or something.

100
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,797
Yeah, I read this story about this killer
who sits behind people in movies

101
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,633
and stabs them with a needle right here.

102
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,401
You die like instantly.

103
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:21,374
Nobody even knows you're dead
until the movie's over and you don't get up.

104
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:22,808
It's so creep...

105
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:27,108
Beat them, baby! Owls, number one!
Let's do this! Yeah!

106
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:28,182
Oh, my God!

107
00:14:28,282 --> 00:14:30,374
Oh, so weird!

108
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:32,281
Everybody is insanely crazy.

109
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:34,877
- Hey!
- Hey!

110
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,420
I'm looking for Jerrod.

111
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:39,150
- Oh, good luck.
- Oh, there he is! Jerrod!

112
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:40,919
- Jerrod!
- Aubrey, wait!

113
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:43,756
I'll meet you in front of the Fremont at 11:45.

114
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,489
Jerrod!

115
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,112
Aubrey?

116
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:16,448
Aubrey!

117
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,583
Aubrey!

118
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,952
Okay, so I am officially freaking out.

119
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:26,962
I'm just gonna try her cell again,
and you've got to try Jerrod.

120
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,156
Okay.

121
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:35,462
- I think it's coming from over here!
- Don't hang up your phone!

122
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:37,162
- Hello? Hey.
- It's me.

123
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:38,796
Where's Aubrey?

124
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,665
What?

125
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,110
Okay, where did she park?

126
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,042
Where'd she park her car?

127
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,478
- Come on, you rode with her.
- Yeah, it was on that street.

128
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,346
- It's that street, you know the one.
- No. No, I don't know the one.

129
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,078
- Tell me.
- Yeah, I do. It's in front

130
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,246
- of the little art gallery with the gate.
- Yeah.

131
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,318
- Wait!
- Wait a second!

132
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,820
There it is! There's her car!

133
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,492
Help!

134
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:31,621
No!

135
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,525
No!

136
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:44,105
She...

137
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,177
She lives on this thing.

138
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,467
It's her life.

139
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:51,409
Writing.

140
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,478
She loves to write.

141
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,010
Mr. Fleming, I'm gonna have to
take that computer from you.

142
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,782
I need to make a copy of the hard drive.

143
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:03,380
Take it, please. Anything you need.

144
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,828
Daniel,

145
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:17,962
is there any chance
that your daughter might have run away?

146
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,436
Was she unhappy about anything?

147
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,131
Aubrey? Unhappy?

148
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:27,443
No.

149
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:29,909
Not at all.

150
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:31,607
You sure about that?

151
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,351
Where were you
when Aubrey left for the game?

152
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:43,319
I was on a conference call,
so I was in the dining room, pacing.

153
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,824
You know, I always pace when I...

154
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:48,553
Do you remember saying goodbye to her?

155
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,888
Can you describe how she looked?

156
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,659
What her mood was?

157
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,675
You know, you don't always

158
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,301
think to take a mental picture
of your daughter

159
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,710
every time she leaves the house.

160
00:19:13,182 --> 00:19:15,116
I used to do that, but...

161
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:19,312
"The Worrier," Daniel used to call me.

162
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:27,118
Do you have kids?

163
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,497
It falls away, and...

164
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,503
They always come back.

165
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,766
You know, they never don't come back.
It just...

166
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:37,758
Aubrey!

167
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:44,164
Aubrey!

168
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,085
Keep your eyes peeled!

169
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,440
3:00 sharp? Yeah, good man.

170
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:42,416
Jesus.

171
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,784
Well, I hope our little investigation
doesn't interfere with bingo night.

172
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,412
I feel like half a person, you know?

173
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:21,916
And, all of a sudden, it dawns on me,
this is Steve and Vicky.

174
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,384
Steve and Vicky this, Steve and Vicky that.

175
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,718
We're finishing each other's sentences here.

176
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,758
Hell, we're finishing each other's thoughts.

177
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:55,803
Hey!

178
00:23:58,415 --> 00:23:59,677
You okay?

179
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:03,242
Hey!

180
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:14,319
Yeah?

181
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:17,257
Susan!

182
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:19,831
Is she alive?

183
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:24,060
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. How bad?

184
00:24:38,548 --> 00:24:40,879
Her blood pressure's increasing.

185
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,581
- She's fucking awake.
- For God's sake.

186
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:46,710
Increasing her thiopental.

187
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,792
Orthopedic saw. Orthopedic saw, now.

188
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,535
Well! Hey, beautiful.

189
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:17,369
Nobody expected to see those eyes
for a while.

190
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:25,745
- I'm in the hospital?
- You're safe now.

191
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:29,889
What hospital am I in? Where?

192
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:32,791
I'll...

193
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:35,650
I'll get the doctor, okay?

194
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,435
Oh, my...

195
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,906
Oh, my God!

196
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,012
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

197
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:27,767
Look, the press is asking questions.

198
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,669
- Now, I think what we should do...
- No, no, no. No comments, no leaks.

199
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:34,833
Aubrey Fleming is still missing
as far as the world's concerned,

200
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:36,705
- and I want to keep it that way.
- Everyone at the hospital's

201
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:39,279
been threatened with dismissal
and obstruction of justice charges

202
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,609
if they leak a word of this. We clear?

203
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,979
Plausible explanations. Okay.

204
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:47,484
Number one, he was done with her.
He left her on the side of the road to die.

205
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:50,180
But he didn't count on her will to live.

206
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:51,756
I don't buy it.

207
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:54,552
He wasn't done with Aubrey Fleming,
not by a long shot.

208
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,889
He only had her for what? 17, 18 days?

209
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:02,022
The sectioning was just getting started.
Her leg wasn't completely off.

210
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:05,066
And why the hell would he sew her fingers
back onto her hand,

211
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,225
- and her hand back onto...
- But wait a minute.

212
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,825
Remember, Jennifer Toland drowned.

213
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,399
I mean, now, it's too early
for an accurate profile but...

214
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:14,673
I think the cutting is about punishment.

215
00:27:14,775 --> 00:27:17,073
And when the punishment is over,

216
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,543
he finds a way for the death to happen,
so he doesn't have to be there.

217
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:24,844
Now, he doesn't like the dying part,
but he's got to make sure it happens.

218
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:27,776
Dying freaks him out.

219
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,080
I think she escaped.

220
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:32,019
The only answer
that makes any sense to me.

221
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:38,050
Hey, honey pie.

222
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:43,959
Sure did miss you.

223
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:51,771
We're gonna have you home in no time,
and we can put all this behind us.

224
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:53,995
Home?

225
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:55,734
Isn't that right, Doctor?

226
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,934
Aubrey's been very brave.

227
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,480
With any luck,
we'll have her out of the ICU tomorrow.

228
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,313
Who is Aubrey?

229
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:11,753
Who are you?

230
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,386
Who is...

231
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:18,289
- Who is Aubrey?
- No.

232
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:22,358
- Oh, my God.
- I don't...

233
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:24,489
I just, I don't...

234
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,659
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Please, don't.

235
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,644
Aubrey Fleming,
session number one, 10:30 a.m.

236
00:28:47,151 --> 00:28:48,981
I'm not Aubrey Fleming.

237
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:50,485
Then what should I call you?

238
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,680
My real name would be nice.

239
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:56,587
Session number one, 10:30 a.m.

240
00:28:58,193 --> 00:28:59,592
Dakota Moss.

241
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,128
Listen.

242
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,165
I know I may look a little like
this Aubrey chick, or whatever her name is,

243
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:09,496
but I'm not her, okay? I am not her.

244
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,829
Let's get some housekeeping
out of the way first.

245
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:16,902
- Date of birth?
- June 9th, 1988.

246
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:19,976
Social Security number?

247
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,501
I don't have one.

248
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:26,080
Look, when you're raised by a crack addict
who thinks the less

249
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,810
that people know about you, the better,
it kind of sticks.

250
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,910
I made up a Social Security number
when I needed one,

251
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,320
but I couldn't keep a job long enough
for that to matter.

252
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:39,518
A job? You're fairly young to be working.

253
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:43,960
Yeah, well, I didn't grow up in New Salem.
I grew up in the real world.

254
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:47,131
You mentioned your mother.

255
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:48,633
Dead.

256
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,333
How did your mother die?

257
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,896
O.D.

258
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:56,240
How long ago?

259
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:04,876
<i>Six, seven months ago.
We weren't really what you'd call close</i>

260
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:07,313
<i>since she'd started using again.</i>

261
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:11,682
<i>But I could always count on seeing
the palm of her hand on payday.</i>

262
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:15,916
<i>When she didn't come around,
I assumed she was dead.</i>

263
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,719
<i>Wasn't too hard to see that one coming.</i>

264
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,048
She was stupid.

265
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,889
Pathetic.

266
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,696
And a junkie.

267
00:31:21,076 --> 00:31:22,509
<i>Did your mother leave you anything?</i>

268
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:25,373
<i>Yeah. $11.</i>

269
00:31:36,523 --> 00:31:39,980
Tell me something. Why does a shrink need
your Social Security number?

270
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:43,590
I like to have it for my files.

271
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,864
You're fuzz, aren't you?

272
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,534
I don't want to lie to you.

273
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:55,001
I am a psychiatrist,
but I also do work for the FBI.

274
00:31:55,104 --> 00:31:56,935
I fucking knew it.

275
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,734
It doesn't mean I care any less
for the work we do here.

276
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:04,835
You know, you're wasting your time
because I've got nothing to tell you.

277
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:08,312
In cases like these, there are specific details
that we withhold from the public

278
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:12,475
to separate the serial confessors
from the serial killer.

279
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:15,679
The pattern of your injuries is identical.
Not similar,

280
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:20,124
identical, with another young girl.

281
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:22,556
A murdered girl, from New Salem.

282
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:25,924
Prove it.

283
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,073
Oh, my God.

284
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,372
Hello, Mrs. Fleming.

285
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,104
Hey.

286
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:49,613
Hi.

287
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:53,446
I brought some of your things
to make you feel more at home.

288
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:59,588
This is Mr. Gervais.

289
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,528
All right.

290
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:13,033
Look, I'm sure you're a very nice woman.
Really. But I don't have a home.

291
00:33:13,135 --> 00:33:16,570
And, yeah, I just want to know
when I get to get out of here.

292
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:21,768
You don't remember Mr. Gervais
and sleeping with him?

293
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:24,835
Nope.

294
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,446
And this is some of your...

295
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,052
Some... Some of Aubrey's favorite music,
on that.

296
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:39,514
Now, where are... Shit.

297
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:42,650
How could I forget the earphones?

298
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,061
This was the most important thing in here.

299
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:49,653
You love your music, and, you know,

300
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:53,256
they use music to help
people come out of comas.

301
00:33:53,368 --> 00:33:55,961
Do I look like I'm in a fucking coma?

302
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:05,602
What else you got in the bag?

303
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,872
What's that? Is it a picture?

304
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,969
Yeah.

305
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,480
<i>Dr. Mancuso to the ER.
Dr. Mancuso to the ER.</i>

306
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,675
Here.

307
00:34:18,955 --> 00:34:20,183
Where...

308
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:22,888
Who gave you this?

309
00:34:23,258 --> 00:34:24,555
Is something happening?

310
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:27,726
When I was a little girl, I...

311
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,354
You were seven.

312
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,990
We all went to Hawaii for Christmas.

313
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,870
The pictures are almost the same.

314
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:43,673
My bathing suit was different,
the water wasn't blue.

315
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:47,141
It was brown, actually.

316
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,406
And my mother took me there

317
00:34:49,514 --> 00:34:51,708
as if it was some sort of treat or something

318
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:54,308
to watch freaking garbage float.

319
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:01,882
What is it, honey?

320
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:06,956
A lot of little girls look alike, I guess.

321
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,164
What's this?

322
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:19,828
You've got to understand that we are trying

323
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:22,270
- to help your daughter, Mrs. Fleming.
- This is what you call help?

324
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:25,206
- This isn't help. This is just more torture.
- I have full authority

325
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:26,776
- to conduct this investigation...
- Don't!

326
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:28,902
...in any way I see fit.
- You do not have full authority.

327
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:31,139
- I'm trying to prevent it happening...
- Hasn't she suffered enough?

328
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,943
...to another girl and mother...
- Are you just trying...

329
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,175
...because it will...
...to prolong our pain?

330
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:37,252
...Mrs. Fleming. It will.
- My God, where is your sympathy?

331
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:40,344
Your daughter is lucky to be alive,
but she will not be safe

332
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:44,357
until whoever did this to her is behind bars.

333
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,750
She's not safe.

334
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,149
Dakota, this is Julie Bascombe
and Phil Lazarus.

335
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:22,620
Yeah, I've seen them around.
Two of my prison guards.

336
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:28,027
The security measures are all
for your own comfort, Dakota.

337
00:36:29,028 --> 00:36:32,122
Dakota, who cut you?
That's all we want to know.

338
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,561
Look, once he finds out you're still alive,
he's gonna come after you.

339
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:39,829
Now, we've done everything we can
to keep this out of the press,

340
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:42,167
but it's bound to get out sooner or later.

341
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:44,331
So, you're gonna use me as bait,
unless I cooperate.

342
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:46,169
Is that what you're saying?

343
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:51,305
Dakota, help us, please.
You saw the pictures of Jennifer.

344
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:54,974
The same person who cut her cut you.
You can't deny that.

345
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:59,615
What do you remember
about the past few weeks?

346
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,414
Everything.

347
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:06,686
Everything? That's unusual.

348
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,919
Dakota, who did this to you?

349
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,421
I don't know.

350
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,555
- Were you blindfolded?
- You were locked up?

351
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,826
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't make sense to you.

352
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,163
We'll put the pieces together.

353
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:28,668
All right, so I got this new job. Night shift.

354
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:31,905
What kind of job?

355
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:34,710
A hostess.

356
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,680
At a gentlemen's club.

357
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:40,951
Don't care how old you really are, kiddo.

358
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:45,183
Your ID says you're 21,
you're fucking 21 to me.

359
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:51,960
<i>An exotic dancer,
that's what the hostess job turned out to be.</i>

360
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:42,717
<i>He could've been there
the first night I danced. I don't know.</i>

361
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,147
Everything about him was just...

362
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:04,041
I don't know, was intense.

363
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,577
I never really got to see his face.

364
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:09,518
How do you know it was the same guy
from the club?

365
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:13,114
- I just knew.
- Was he tall? Thin? Stocky? What?

366
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,552
He was wearing blue gloves.

367
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,290
- The rubber kind that doctors wear.
- Are you sure?

368
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,889
Look, I'm not sure about anything, okay?

369
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,559
What about when he cut you?

370
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:27,734
You didn't see him then?

371
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:33,166
- No.
- Look, he gave you drugs, Aubrey. Okay?

372
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:34,708
To make you watch.

373
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,642
To keep you awake,
so you'd have to have seen something.

374
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:38,837
I don't lie.

375
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,673
If I tell you I didn't see him,
I didn't fucking see him.

376
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,806
How do you know it was the same guy
who cut you, then?

377
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:46,511
You're right. I don't know.

378
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:50,213
Aubrey, you have got to
stop playing games with us.

379
00:43:50,322 --> 00:43:53,314
Am I making myself clear?
We have to know the truth.

380
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,790
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to know the truth?

381
00:43:55,893 --> 00:43:58,794
Well, what about me? You think I don't?

382
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,795
How the fuck would you feel?

383
00:44:00,897 --> 00:44:05,128
Fingers, leg, hand, gone.
I practically fucking died.

384
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,431
And now, I'm locked up
in the fucking hospital

385
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:10,504
like a goddamn prisoner!

386
00:44:39,863 --> 00:44:41,694
So, what are you saying, Doctor?

387
00:44:41,798 --> 00:44:45,893
I don't know.
Usually it's easy to find the inconsistencies,

388
00:44:46,001 --> 00:44:47,195
the holes in the fantasy.

389
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,997
Even in the most extreme cases
of posttraumatic stress,

390
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:54,268
you get a tiny measure
of the original person.

391
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:57,343
You know what I think, Doctor?
I think we're wasting our time.

392
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,037
- I think this kid is lying through her teeth.
- No.

393
00:45:01,714 --> 00:45:04,615
She's not lying. She's...

394
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:11,981
I don't think it's that simple.

395
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:13,579
She was withholding deliberately.

396
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:14,657
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

397
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:16,384
I thought she just ran out of imagination.

398
00:45:16,492 --> 00:45:18,551
Aubrey Fleming is not short on imagination.

399
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:19,923
- That's for sure.
- Okay.

400
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:24,931
So, she gets to a certain point in her story
and she stops talking. Why?

401
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:28,695
Sometimes people create alter egos
to relay information

402
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:32,169
that their primary personalities
would never reveal.

403
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,866
So, why would the alter ego withhold?

404
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:36,809
I don't know.

405
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,075
I think she doesn't tell everybody
the whole story

406
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,374
because she doesn't think
anybody's gonna believe her.

407
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:45,449
I mean, she's not even sure
she believes what happened to her.

408
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:02,486
<i>... unconfirmed reports tonight,
in this News 5 exclusive,</i>

409
00:46:03,398 --> 00:46:04,956
<i>that the abducted teen has been found</i>

410
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:08,557
<i>and has been secretly held
at New Salem Hospital for over a week.</i>

411
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:10,364
<i>- News 5 will continue to update you...
- Shit.</i>

412
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,664
<i>... on this story as it develops.</i>

413
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:00,601
No. No!

414
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:03,441
No! Get off, get him off me!

415
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:07,414
Aubrey! What happened?
Sweetheart, what happened?

416
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:08,710
Honey, what happened?
Who did this to you?

417
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:11,184
- Somebody come in here!
- Get off of me!

418
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,652
It's okay, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.
It's okay. It's Daddy.

419
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:16,280
It's all right.

420
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:18,858
- Calm down and back away, Mr. Fleming.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

421
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,417
Somebody came in here and sliced up
my little girl. I want you to find him now!

422
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,891
No! No!

423
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:53,315
I am Aubrey Fleming.

424
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:57,684
My name is Aubrey Fleming.

425
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,590
I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach,
and playing the piano.

426
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:04,595
I have never seen the inside of a strip club
or a crack house,

427
00:48:04,697 --> 00:48:07,221
and I have never sold my body
to hairy old men with B.O.

428
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:09,129
Because I am perfect.

429
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:18,573
Say hello to your new state-of-the-art hand.

430
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,547
Your nerve impulses get picked up
by sensors

431
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:32,210
that control six different sets of gears
and motors inside the hand,

432
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,187
so the movements are incredibly lifelike
and precise.

433
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,881
It's so creepy.

434
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:40,220
No. It's beautiful.

435
00:48:40,326 --> 00:48:42,988
Once we're sure everything works
the way it's supposed to,

436
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:44,995
we'll fit this over it.

437
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:52,829
Lovely.

438
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,437
Step forward.

439
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:00,932
Take your time.

440
00:49:04,713 --> 00:49:06,044
Beautiful.

441
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,913
You're almost there, you're almost there.

442
00:49:14,387 --> 00:49:18,948
Excellent, excellent. You'll be back
on the dance floor in no time, Dakota.

443
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,524
It's amazing.

444
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,116
- Thank you.
- For?

445
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,125
For calling me Dakota.

446
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:29,361
Just don't forget to plug it in
when you're not wearing it.

447
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,061
If the battery runs down,
it's like dragging around a wooden leg.

448
00:49:33,169 --> 00:49:34,261
Okay.

449
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:52,142
I think we managed
to avoid all those reporters.

450
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,728
Aubrey chose the colors?

451
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,824
Yeah. Aubrey. Aubrey chose everything.

452
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:14,109
Thanks for putting me up for a while.
I appreciate it.

453
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:20,016
Well...

454
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:23,288
Looks like we're not the only ones
happy to see you home.

455
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,690
I don't like cats.

456
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:31,863
Okay. Yeah.

457
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,231
If you need anything, just...

458
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,137
Hold it!

459
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:49,847
- ID, please.
- Yeah, sure.

460
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:55,378
Go on.

461
00:51:58,621 --> 00:52:00,418
That's the boyfriend.

462
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:49,000

Dakota Moss.

00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:42,713
Sorry, I'm not really used to this thing yet.

469
00:52:44,192 --> 00:52:46,285
It's fucked up though, huh?

470
00:52:48,195 --> 00:52:50,629
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, sure.

471
00:52:51,732 --> 00:52:53,460
Are those flowers for me?

472
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:54,658
Yeah.

473
00:52:55,835 --> 00:52:57,029
Thanks.

474
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:00,703
Might as well sit down.

475
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:09,578
It's upstairs.

476
00:53:12,015 --> 00:53:14,313
Just keep forgetting to plug it in at night.

477
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,151
I was supposed to protect you.

478
00:53:18,253 --> 00:53:20,152
So, you must be Aubrey's boyfriend.

479
00:53:21,422 --> 00:53:22,514
Yeah.

480
00:53:24,525 --> 00:53:25,650
I'm not Aubrey.

481
00:53:30,063 --> 00:53:31,927
I'm really not Aubrey.

482
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:45,204
Aubrey wouldn't do that, would she?

483
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:55,715
Can I get you guys anything?

484
00:53:58,385 --> 00:54:00,182
Oh, hi, Mrs. Fleming.

485
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:04,356
We're gonna go upstairs.

486
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:09,354
- Could you? Thanks.
- Sure.

487
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,438
- Well, you coming?
- Yeah.

488
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:30,305
Oh, and Susan, would you mind putting
the blue roses in some water for me?

489
00:54:30,412 --> 00:54:31,605
Thanks.

490
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:49,460
There's only one of these,
so we better make it last.

491
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:37,511
Don't stop! Oh, my God.

492
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,292
Aubrey?

493
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,634
Why are you doing this?

494
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,669
Did she ever fuck you like that?

495
00:57:14,113 --> 00:57:15,842
Did she ever fuck you at all?

496
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:21,308
Do you think she'd start now?

497
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,351
Look, if you want me to call you Dakota,
I'll call you Dakota.

498
00:57:27,456 --> 00:57:30,118
But if you're not Aubrey,
then how'd you get all cut up?

499
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:36,196
I don't know.

500
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:40,565
I can't really explain.

501
01:00:19,464 --> 01:00:20,658
Oh, God.

502
01:00:43,284 --> 01:00:45,945
I found that heroin ho just like that.

503
01:00:47,086 --> 01:00:49,213
What happened to her hand?

504
01:00:49,322 --> 01:00:52,222
Why the hell you asking me?
How should I know?

505
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,392
What happened to your hand, kiddo?

506
01:00:58,162 --> 01:00:59,789
I'll be okay.

507
01:00:59,897 --> 01:01:02,023
What happened to your hand?

508
01:01:02,132 --> 01:01:03,997
Damn, that bitch lost a lot of blood.

509
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,933
You can die from losing that kind of blood.

510
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,260
Dance.

511
01:01:09,371 --> 01:01:10,565
I'm just saying!

512
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,699
Dance.

513
01:01:13,541 --> 01:01:17,477
Marlene is out there, and she'll kick my ass
if I go out there while she's on.

514
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,238
You go out there.

515
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:33,881
So?

516
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,953
I was just having a drink out back

517
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:45,330
and I dropped a glass.
Must've cut myself when I picked it up.

518
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:50,237
How you gonna get to the emergency room?

519
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,603
Hospitals are for rich people. I'll be okay.

520
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,073
How you gonna get home?

521
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:57,500
I will be fine.

522
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:00,576
You better take an extra towel.

523
01:02:12,256 --> 01:02:14,223
You got to hold it higher.

524
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:19,655
You got to hold it higher than your heart.

525
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:37,569
Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?

526
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:43,170
People get cut.

527
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:45,914
That's life.

528
01:02:53,757 --> 01:02:55,952
People get cut. That's life.

529
01:02:58,494 --> 01:02:59,654
Jesus.

530
01:03:00,462 --> 01:03:01,929
So my finger got cut off,

531
01:03:02,897 --> 01:03:04,421
but nobody did it.

532
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:07,557
Who's gonna believe that?

533
01:03:09,336 --> 01:03:11,634
Look at you. You don't even believe it.

534
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:12,830
Yeah, I do.

535
01:03:14,006 --> 01:03:15,439
That's because I fucked you.

536
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:21,879
- What is it?
- My foot.

537
01:03:25,983 --> 01:03:26,950
Wrong foot.

538
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,478
It's phantom limb pain.

539
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:35,687
It's enough to make you
believe in ghosts, huh?

540
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:39,318
You know,
maybe that's why ghosts are restless.

541
01:03:42,363 --> 01:03:45,560
Because there's nothing left
of what they were except for the pain.

542
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:51,402
I need your help, Jerrod.

543
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:14,519
Piece of shit.

544
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:18,525
Hey. You got a condom, man?

545
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,422
- No!
- What? I'm serious. I'll buy it off you.

546
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,290
I'm sorry, kid. I don't have one.

547
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:26,030
Hey, any of you guys got a rubber?

548
01:04:27,834 --> 01:04:29,768
No, I'm... You don't carry rubbers?

549
01:04:31,169 --> 01:04:32,363
Thanks.

550
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:41,476
Hey, hey!

551
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:45,841
Where you headed, boy?

552
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,507
Just let me through, okay?

553
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:51,943
- Go ahead, kid.
- Thank you.

554
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:04,352
We're at the Tolands' house. Here.

555
01:05:07,733 --> 01:05:10,166
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.

556
01:05:10,268 --> 01:05:12,099
So, this is it?

557
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:15,330
- You want me to go in with you?
- No, it's okay.

558
01:05:15,439 --> 01:05:18,135
You probably better go back.
They might get suspicious.

559
01:05:29,284 --> 01:05:30,807
- Okay.
- All right.

560
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:31,976
Bye.

561
01:06:16,355 --> 01:06:18,448
Why did you have to come here, Aubrey?

562
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:23,694
You've still got your life.
Nobody in this house has any left.

563
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,023
And you're not cooperating with the police.

564
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:30,495
I've heard all about it.
You know, you could help find the monster.

565
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:33,997
I'm sorry, I can't.

566
01:06:43,277 --> 01:06:46,212
I know you didn't come over here
to upset us.

567
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:53,218
Just seeing her room would be enough.

568
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:18,515
Aubrey!

569
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,423
This is what they call protecting us?

570
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:26,858
- Where the hell was Lanny Rierden?
- All right.

571
01:08:26,962 --> 01:08:29,192
Daniel, come on. Just calm down.
She's safe.

572
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:31,266
I mean, he's mad because he knows
I'm telling the truth.

573
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:35,927
- He knows Aubrey's still out there.
- Aubrey, please. Just shut the fuck up.

574
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:40,396
Latest DNA test came back.

575
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:45,272
Hello? Julie?
You want to take a look at them?

576
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:47,402
Take a look at this.

577
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:50,811
I thought I should go over
Aubrey's hard drive one more time, right?

578
01:08:52,684 --> 01:08:56,084
<i>" She wrote down the name
and her real mother's last known address,</i>

579
01:08:56,186 --> 01:09:00,815
"but it was what she saw next that
slammed her in the gut like a celestial fist.

580
01:09:00,923 --> 01:09:04,859
"She stared at the hospital records
in disbelief. It couldn't be true.

581
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,450
"But there it was, in black and white.

582
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:10,326
"Not only did she have a mother
she'd never met,

583
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:12,763
"she also had an identical twin.

584
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:18,936
"But Virginia Sue Moss had left town
with her twin sister almost 20 years ago.

585
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:21,767
"How would she ever find her other half?

586
01:09:21,873 --> 01:09:25,036
"She knew only that she had to try.
She had no choice.

587
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:27,971
"To be continued."

588
01:09:29,814 --> 01:09:31,076
Moss.

589
01:09:31,182 --> 01:09:33,172
As in Dakota Moss. Yeah.

590
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:36,943
- So this proves that...
- That she's always been

591
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:38,519
and always will be Aubrey Fleming.

592
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,214
I mean, she's living inside a world
she made up.

593
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:45,588
So the DNA test comparing
Aubrey and Dakota...

594
01:09:45,693 --> 01:09:46,819
Came back identical.

595
01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:49,323
Damn right, it did.

596
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:06,108
Higher than your heart.

597
01:10:17,919 --> 01:10:19,750
Odd, even.

598
01:10:20,856 --> 01:10:23,449
Right, left.

599
01:10:23,557 --> 01:10:26,151
Rest, motion.

600
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,920
Peace, war.

601
01:10:29,462 --> 01:10:32,056
Love, hate.

602
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:34,132
Two halves to everything.

603
01:10:35,734 --> 01:10:37,725
Sometimes people get cut.

604
01:10:41,372 --> 01:10:43,772
Sometimes people get cut in half.

605
01:12:31,062 --> 01:12:35,293
<i>Darker than the shadowy depths
of the deepest ocean,</i>

606
01:12:35,398 --> 01:12:40,096
<i>more infinite than the starry universe,
in three meager pounds,</i>

607
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:44,263
<i>all the knowledge that ever was
or ever will be.</i>

608
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:49,435
<i>I'm Art Bell,
and these are the mysteries of the mind.</i>

609
01:12:49,544 --> 01:12:51,875
<i>The best documented case
of stigmatic twins</i>

610
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:56,808
<i>is that of Joseph K., 35,
and his twin brother, Jacob.</i>

611
01:12:58,317 --> 01:13:02,582
<i>Jacob K. Was a petty thief
with a gambling problem.</i>

612
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:06,487
<i>He owed more than $5,000 to the mob.</i>

613
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:10,219
<i>Unable to pay off his loan,
Jacob K. Was targeted for assassination</i>

614
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:13,659
<i>on the night of December 18th, 1944.</i>

615
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,697
<i>The very same night Jacob K.
Was gunned down,</i>

616
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:24,737
<i>a deep puncture wound appeared
in Joseph K. 's neck in the same spot.</i>

617
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:27,831
<i>Lacking all explanation,
authorities concluded</i>

618
01:13:27,942 --> 01:13:31,035
<i>that Joseph K. 's wound was self-inflicted.</i>

619
01:13:31,144 --> 01:13:34,307
<i>They failed, however,
to address just how he could've known</i>

620
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:37,473
<i>the precise location
of his brother's mortal wound</i>

621
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:43,318
<i>or how both men happened to die
at the same hour, miles apart.</i>

622
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:48,915
Hey.

623
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:51,425
I saw the light. You all right?

624
01:13:52,495 --> 01:13:54,360
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

625
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:00,132
This is a non-smoking house, young lady.

626
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:08,703
And will remain one.

627
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,806
You know, I think that's the first time
I've seen you...

628
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:25,044
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay. I shouldn't have.

629
01:14:26,456 --> 01:14:28,287
I think I'm Aubrey's twin sister.

630
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:31,517
Her identical twin sister.

631
01:14:31,627 --> 01:14:34,061
I mean, hospitals make mistakes.
We could've been separated at birth.

632
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,198
Look at this house,
this life that your daughter had.

633
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:41,392
Why would I pretend to be some loser
if this was all mine, huh?

634
01:14:42,536 --> 01:14:44,367
It's like a bad dream, sweetie.

635
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:50,168
And someday very soon,
you're gonna wake up and realize the truth.

636
01:14:50,276 --> 01:14:52,505
But it's possible we could be twins, right?

637
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,208
You see?

638
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:01,583
You were all by yourself in there.

639
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:06,651
No twin sister. Just you.

640
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:15,054
I'm not much of a crier, you know,

641
01:15:16,764 --> 01:15:18,890
but I cried when I saw this.

642
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:22,793
Daniel and I...

643
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,464
I fell.

644
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,300
And

645
01:15:30,908 --> 01:15:35,072
they made me stay in my bed,
flat on my back, for about six weeks.

646
01:15:37,147 --> 01:15:39,240
Six weeks towards the end,
but it was worth it.

647
01:15:39,349 --> 01:15:42,010
I mean, there were times when I thought,

648
01:15:42,118 --> 01:15:44,848
"I'm not gonna be able
to stand another moment of this."

649
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:49,350
But there were also...
There were times when you'd get

650
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:51,947
real still on me.

651
01:15:53,327 --> 01:15:57,353
And I'd take both my hands,
I'd put them on my belly, and I said,

652
01:15:57,463 --> 01:16:01,194
"Kick. Kick the hell out of me, girl.
Show me what you got."

653
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,359
And you'd kick. Every time.

654
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:08,529
The night you were born. Oh, my God.

655
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:10,934
It was terrifying.

656
01:16:12,476 --> 01:16:16,138
I barely saw you,
and they took you away from me.

657
01:16:16,246 --> 01:16:19,612
And it was...
It was touch-and-go for two whole days.

658
01:16:19,715 --> 01:16:24,243
And then finally,
finally I had you in my arms.

659
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:27,914
A little miracle.

660
01:16:30,424 --> 01:16:34,258
I'm not trying to prove you wrong,
you know?

661
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:38,357
I'm really just trying to help you see.

662
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:47,464
I know.

663
01:16:51,341 --> 01:16:53,331
But you don't believe me.

664
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:02,245
But you don't need me
to believe you, sweetheart.

665
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:06,318
When I think we'll never be normal again...

666
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:11,757
I...

667
01:17:12,992 --> 01:17:16,188
I see that about you. That strength.

668
01:17:20,031 --> 01:17:25,025
And I think, you know, we'll be all right.
No matter what.

669
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:27,467
Different, maybe, but all right.

670
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:30,566
'Cause you're a kicker, girl.

671
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:33,908
You go right ahead

672
01:17:34,009 --> 01:17:37,842
and you kick your way
to the other side of this problem.

673
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,379
I'm gonna be there every step of the way
if you need me.

674
01:18:27,987 --> 01:18:29,079
Shit.

675
01:18:33,892 --> 01:18:35,382
<i>Dakota.</i>

676
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:09,197
I know what you did, Daniel.

677
01:20:10,003 --> 01:20:12,301
- Susan's baby died in the incubator.
- She what?

678
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:14,168
You bought Aubrey
from the crack head down the hall

679
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:15,298
because she had one to spare.

680
01:20:15,408 --> 01:20:16,374
- You're Aubrey.
- Not me.

681
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:17,442
- Hey, you're Aubrey.
- Not me, Daniel.

682
01:20:17,576 --> 01:20:18,565
- You were kidnapped...
- I'm not Aubrey.

683
01:20:18,677 --> 01:20:21,270
...and you were hurt, and you're home now.
- Daniel, I'm not Aubrey.

684
01:20:21,379 --> 01:20:22,846
I'm her twin. Stop it!

685
01:20:24,382 --> 01:20:25,974
I'm her twin.

686
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:28,950
Daniel, you're the only one who knows
that there are really two of us.

687
01:20:29,052 --> 01:20:31,418
- You have to help me.
- I'm trying to help you, honey. I am.

688
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:33,147
No, I saw the envelopes.

689
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,882
I saw the New Salem postmarks.

690
01:20:37,193 --> 01:20:38,989
A little cash on an ongoing basis.

691
01:20:39,094 --> 01:20:41,153
One hits the jackpot,
the other one gets stuck

692
01:20:41,263 --> 01:20:44,629
- with Virginia Sue Moss.
- Okay, enough, okay? Just...

693
01:20:45,866 --> 01:20:48,459
I'm tired of this shit, okay? Just...

694
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:55,004
I'm gonna get you some ice.

695
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:57,632
So you'd let both of us die
just to keep your secret?

696
01:20:57,743 --> 01:20:58,767
No!

697
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:07,515
She lost this one first. So did I.

698
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:11,378
Fuck.

699
01:21:56,257 --> 01:21:57,315
Fuck!

700
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:37,284
Oh, my...

701
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:50,298
Oh, my God.

702
01:22:56,873 --> 01:22:59,364
<i>I always felt like half a person.</i>

703
01:22:59,476 --> 01:23:01,272
<i>You know, half a person with half a soul.</i>

704
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:05,108
<i>It never occurred to me
that I may possibly have a twin.</i>

705
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:09,848
<i>All I had to go on was a gut feeling
and a New Salem postmark.</i>

706
01:23:23,428 --> 01:23:26,488
Look, Daniel, I know you may not care
about what happened to me.

707
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:29,455
But what about Aubrey?

708
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:31,864
What about the girl you raised
to be your daughter?

709
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:34,664
Everything that happens to Aubrey
happens to me.

710
01:23:35,671 --> 01:23:39,071
He still has her, okay?

711
01:23:39,441 --> 01:23:41,341
Now, are you gonna help me find her?

712
01:23:43,845 --> 01:23:45,175
- I can't.
- You can't?

713
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,180
- I can't risk losing this.
- You're pathetic.

714
01:23:50,383 --> 01:23:52,010
Go fuck yourself.

715
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,828
"Blue ribbons are for winners.

716
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:22,300
"Never settle for the red.

717
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:26,208
"Rest in peace. Douglas."

718
01:26:39,556 --> 01:26:42,080
- It's okay, it's me.
- I know who killed me.

719
01:26:42,191 --> 01:26:43,749
You're alive, Dakota, okay? You're not...

720
01:26:43,859 --> 01:26:45,121
No, look.

721
01:26:54,534 --> 01:26:56,559
We really shouldn't go up there
without letting somebody know.

722
01:26:56,669 --> 01:27:00,105
- We don't have enough time.
- I know, I know, I know.

723
01:27:00,206 --> 01:27:04,437
<i>Dakota, there's not enough air.</i>

724
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:06,635
- What is it?
- I can't...

725
01:27:06,744 --> 01:27:08,005
- Hold on. Just breathe.
- No, I can't breathe.

726
01:27:08,111 --> 01:27:09,078
- Breathe. You're having a panic...
- I can't.

727
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:10,976
- You're having a panic attack. Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

728
01:27:11,081 --> 01:27:12,207
It's okay. Come on, breathe.

729
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:14,783
It's okay. It's okay.

730
01:27:14,884 --> 01:27:17,944
You need to breathe. Good, good. Breathe.

731
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:33,360
I should've believed you from the start.

732
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:36,231
I'm sorry.

733
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:42,382
<i>Dakota.</i>

734
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:52,129
<i>Douglas Norquist.</i>

735
01:28:55,566 --> 01:28:58,125
<i>There's two halves to everything.</i>

736
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:23,817
Oh, come on. Just breathe, Aubrey.
Breathe. Slowly.

737
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,461
Fuck you!

738
01:34:07,254 --> 01:34:08,619
Oh, my God.

739
01:34:12,392 --> 01:34:14,656
Daniel, come on. Wake up.

740
01:34:14,761 --> 01:34:16,455
Come on.

741
01:34:16,562 --> 01:34:17,756
Aubrey?

742
01:34:23,434 --> 01:34:24,526
Yeah.

743
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:30,662
- I'm sorry.
- No! Come on, come on. I need you.

744
01:34:30,774 --> 01:34:32,639
Come on, stay with me.

745
01:37:33,957 --> 01:37:35,821
Why did you come back?

746
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,684
You should be dead by now.

747
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:42,789
Why aren't you dead?

748
01:37:46,734 --> 01:37:49,202
I fucking buried you.

749
01:37:51,437 --> 01:37:53,632
How did you get away from me?

750
01:37:54,807 --> 01:37:56,797
How did you get out, huh?

751
01:37:59,211 --> 01:38:04,170
Now, I have to fucking do the whole thing

752
01:38:04,281 --> 01:38:07,875
all over again!
