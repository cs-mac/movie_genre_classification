1
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,545
Blue, 18.

2
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,090
Set. Hit. Hit.

3
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,935
Zach. Zach. Crossbuck 30.
Crossbuck 30.

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,271
Crossbuck 30. Crossbuck 30.

5
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,356
- Ready?
- Ready.

6
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,817
<i>The Eagles will have to go for it</i>
<i>on fourth down</i>

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,862
with just 42 seconds left in the game
and no timeouts.

8
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,949
<i>Coach Taylor can get his first winning</i>
<i>season for the Shiloh Christian Academy</i>

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>if they can pull this play off.</i>

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,121
Move it, team! Set, hit!

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:25,169
<i>Zach Avery pitches back to Jacob Hall.</i>
<i>Jeremy Johnson's going down the field.</i>

12
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,379
- <i>Here come the Tigers.</i>
- Throw it, Jacob!

13
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,508
<i>Jacob's gonna try to tuck it and run,</i>
<i>and he's taken down at the 40-yard line,</i>

14
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,302
<i>stopped by Lewis Slaughter.</i>

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,637
<i>Jeremy Johnson was wide open.</i>

16
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>If he'd had a few seconds more, this</i>
<i>game might have had a different outcome.</i>

17
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,646
As it is, the Tigers will take over now
and will no doubt run out the clock,

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:49,026
<i>ending Coach Grant Taylor's bid for</i>
<i>his first winning season in six years.</i>

19
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:53,447
<i>Now he'll have to wait until next season</i>
<i>for that all-elusive winning record.</i>

20
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,117
That's if they let him
come back next year.

21
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,541
- Hi.
- Get 'em, Claire.

22
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,296
Hey, Grant. Come on, y'all.
Quit talking. Let's go, let's go. Hurry.

23
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,806
What?

24
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,483
What? You gotta be kidding me.

25
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,362
- This had better be a joke.
- No.

26
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:42,115
Mandy said he came in this morning,
got his papers.

27
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,328
A player can't just transfer to another
school. He's gotta change his address.

28
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,914
He did. He's moving in with his dad.

29
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,929
I can't believe that. This is
the third time this has happened.

30
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,348
Spend three years pouring into 'em

31
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,143
and when they get to their senior year,
they transfer to a rival school.

32
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,062
Why?

33
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,357
Well, 'cause at the end of the season,
nobody wants to be on TV

34
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,485
going, "We're number six, baby.
We're number six."

35
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,406
Well, you asked.

36
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,953
Just had to go there, didn't you?

37
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,126
- Did Darren switch to Tucker?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

38
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,670
- So it's true?
- We'll talk about it in a minute.

39
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,630
Huddle up.

40
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,176
Coach, is it true
that Darren transferred to Tucker?

41
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,390
I got word this morning
that Darren did transfer to Tucker.

42
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,436
- There goes the season.
- The season will be whatever we make it.

43
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,355
Who's gonna take his place?
He scored a third of our points.

44
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,734
You let me worry about that.
We're not starting as if it's doomsday.

45
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,195
- Nobody's irreplaceable.
- Darren is.

46
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,364
Darren is not. There's more
to a good football team than a running back.

47
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:07,284
If anything, this ought to push you
to take up the slack.

48
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,078
Stop worrying about Darren.
Start your drills.

49
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:15,250
- We got a game to play this Friday night.
- Let's go, Shiloh. Come on. Let's go.

50
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,487
Why'd you park all the way out there?

51
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,697
Had to. It died again.

52
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,783
Why don't we get a new battery?

53
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,245
I'll get Brady to help me tomorrow.
I don't wanna think about it now.

54
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,456
- Do you want me to take a look at it for you?
- Stop it.

55
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,794
Oh, sweetheart...

56
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,548
I don't know what that smell is.
I've scrubbed everything I can.

57
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,968
- It's terrible.
- I know it is, but what else can I do?

58
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,011
I don't know where it's coming from.

59
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,264
This day stunk. Why shouldn't my house?

60
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,725
- What do you mean?
- Darren transferred to Tucker.

61
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,978
What? He did not.

62
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,523
Yep. Came by and got his papers,
didn't even say goodbye.

63
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,942
- Why?
- Why do you think?

64
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,528
Didn't see a chance of winning
at Shiloh.

65
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,865
But it ain't like Tucker's
gonna guarantee him a scholarship.

66
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,660
- I bet the boys are frustrated.
- More than you know.

67
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,346
I meant to throw that away.

68
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,057
Did you think you were pregnant?

69
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:59,146
I don't know. I just wanna be pregnant
so bad that my mind plays tricks on me.

70
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,827
You know, it's been four years
since we started trying.

71
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,207
Would you be opposed
to me going to see a specialist?

72
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,001
No.

73
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,754
I'd just like to know what she says.

74
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,925
OK.

75
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,929
I thought we were having
spaghetti tonight.

76
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,014
Stove's not working.

77
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,683
You are kidding me.

78
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,938
So we got a leak in the back room,
the dryer only works half the time,

79
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,775
the car's dying on us
and now the stove's broken.

80
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,860
That's about right.

81
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,071
No wonder I'm losing my hair.

82
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,449
I love you.

83
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:05,754
<i>And now your Georgia Sports Break</i>
<i>with Alicia Houston.</i>

84
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,883
The Richland Giants start football practice
as the new school year gets under way.

85
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,804
The team will be defending a three-year
GISA state championship run.

86
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,973
Now they prepare to fight for a fourth.

87
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,976
I'm here with head coach Bobby Lee Duke
of the Giants.

88
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,186
How does this year look for the team?

89
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:25,065
Alice, we've grown real fond
of the state title.

90
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,651
And we don't see any reason
to give it up this year.

91
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:31,572
I've got most of my starters coming back
and I've got a strong bench.

92
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,740
So I've only got one thing to say:

93
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:38,161
get off the tracks,
'cause the freight train's coming.

94
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,460
I hope that's not a sign of the way
the rest of the season's gonna go, Coach.

95
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,296
- Why did he have to say that?
- Just let it go.

96
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,048
I hate this car.

97
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,759
Let's find somebody with jumper cables
and let's go home.

98
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,429
It's bad enough you lose your first game.
Now I can't even start my own car.

99
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,475
This happens to everybody.
Don't be embarrassed about it.

100
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,648
- Grant, I wasn't that embarrassed.
- Then why did you hide?

101
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,942
Why does this house
have to stink so bad?

102
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,613
You'll get used to it
after a couple of hours.

103
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,324
Honey, we gotta do something
about the car.

104
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,327
The only thing it does faithfully for us
is break down.

105
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,245
That's about right.

106
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,541
Would it not be better
just to get a small new car?

107
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,419
- You know we can't afford that.
- How do other people do it?

108
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:35,339
Other people make
more than 24,000 a year.

109
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,424
You make 6,000. That takes us to 30.

110
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,093
Enough to help us
with repairs occasionally,

111
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,513
not with a new car payment.

112
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:46,308
Besides, there's other bills
we don't normally have to pay.

113
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,770
- Like what?
- Like my doctor bill.

114
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,815
You saw her today?

115
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,653
- What did she say?
- She said that I'm fine.

116
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:02,950
My numbers are normal and she saw
nothing that gave her concern.

117
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,578
- That's good.
- It doesn't mean the problem is with you.

118
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:11,333
- What else could it mean?
- We just may not have given it enough time.

119
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,502
Four years?

120
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,465
Are you still hoping we'll have a baby?

121
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:24,054
- You know I am.
- Me too.

122
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,058
I catch myself thinking about it
more and more.

123
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:32,980
Don't you wanna know
if something's preventing it?

124
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,527
Are you afraid of getting checked out?

125
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,863
Yes.

126
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:45,284
Grant, I'm still clinging to a hope

127
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,911
that one day we'll have children.

128
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:55,252
I imagine 'em running in this house.

129
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,213
I hear 'em playing in the backyard

130
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:02,885
or running to our bed in a thunderstorm.

131
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:08,056
And I think about reading 'em stories

132
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,144
and teaching 'em songs.

133
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,608
And I just keep thinking

134
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:26,450
how can I miss someone so much
that I have never met?

135
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,582
I'll go.

136
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,342
Stanley.

137
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,261
Stanley.

138
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,016
Stanley, do you wanna tell me
what you're doing on the top of my desk?

139
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,268
No.

140
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,147
Do you have any idea
how you got on top of my desk?

141
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,232
No.

142
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,901
I suggest you get down immediately.

143
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,163
You two can tell Coach Taylor
that you're late for practice today

144
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,457
because you've been
sitting in detention.

145
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,626
Come on. That was some serious humor.

146
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,964
I'll get serious about your humor
when you get serious about your studies.

147
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,677
55?

148
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:32,558
Well, if you wanna announce your grade
to the entire class, you go right ahead.

149
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,726
57.

150
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,691
So basically we got
the toughest schedule we ever had

151
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,110
and less talent than we ever had.

152
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,406
At least we got Dewey County on Friday
night. That'll be a pretty easy win.

153
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,494
- I'm concerned it might be our only win.
- We'll pull three or four out.

154
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,539
That'll give us another average season.

155
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,833
I'm so sick of average seasons.

156
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,753
- I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

157
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,506
- Got a doctor's appointment.
- For what?

158
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,842
- I have a doctor's appointment.
- For what?

159
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:11,180
Leave the man alone.
He don't have to tell you.

160
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,515
So what's wrong with you, man?

161
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,059
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

162
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,273
Now look what you did.
You done made him mad.

163
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,692
Me? You're the one that made him mad.

164
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,404
No, not me.
Besides, I know where he's going.

165
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,949
- Where?
- He's going to the hair doctor.

166
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,537
The man is going bald. You hadn't
noticed that underdeveloped region?

167
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,289
You're one to talk, Slick.

168
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:41,210
See, when a black man goes bald,
he still looks good.

169
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:46,173
Look at Michael Jordan,
George Foreman, Samuel L. Jackson.

170
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,843
Classy-looking brothers.
Who you got? Kojak?

171
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,639
Yeah, Coach gonna get him some plugs.

172
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:58,519
- Grant would not get plugs.
- Don't laugh. You next.

173
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,461
Your soccer skills
get better every year, son.

174
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:28,090
It doesn't matter. Shiloh doesn't have
a soccer team. They play football.

175
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,884
So? Why not kick for the football team?

176
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,011
They've already got a good kicker.

177
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,264
I'm sure they wouldn't mind
having two.

178
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,101
Dad, I'm too small. I really
just don't feel like getting killed.

179
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,229
Are you saying you're not interested

180
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,065
or you'd like to try out
but you're afraid?

181
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,109
What if I don't even make the team?

182
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,028
Well, you're already not on the team.

183
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,323
You can't get any more not on the team
than you are right now.

184
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,160
- OK, Dad.
- David, you can't be afraid of failure.

185
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,163
Everyone fails at some point.

186
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,458
So you think I should try out
for the football team?

187
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:08,088
Well, if you're waiting around
for soccer, it ain't gonna happen.

188
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,643
- Coach Owens, have you got a minute?
- Yeah.

189
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:25,689
Look, some of the men have been talking.

190
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,984
We wanna see this school succeed
with our football program.

191
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,153
I know you feel the same way, too.

192
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:37,034
But, frankly, we don't ever see that
happening while Coach Taylor is here.

193
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,494
You know we're in a rebuilding season.

194
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:44,541
Look, I know he's a fine man and all,
but he's had six years here

195
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,669
and nothing significant
to even show for it.

196
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:50,797
I honestly believe
you would make a better head coach.

197
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,559
Some of us have requested
a meeting with Mr. Ryker.

198
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:08,106
If you would just support us, I really
believe this could go a lot easier.

199
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,234
Mr. Pervis, I don't know.

200
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,903
Look, it's not like
we're trying to hurt the guy.

201
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,365
What we're doing
is for the benefit of the school.

202
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,952
You just think about it.

203
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,915
Good hustle, Casey.

204
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,879
- What was that about?
- What?

205
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,300
- Alvin Pervis.
- We were just talking.

206
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,804
Everything all right?

207
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,223
- Yeah.
- Mr. Taylor.

208
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,684
Yes.

209
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,605
I'm Larry Childers.
This is my son David. He's a junior.

210
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,692
- We're new to the school.
- Good to meet you. What can I do for you?

211
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:56,238
I just wanted to introduce myself to you
and David wanted to try out for the team.

212
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,324
- You a football player?
- I've always played soccer.

213
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,911
- I figured I could try out as a kicker.
- I've got a pretty good kicker,

214
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:07,040
but I don't mind letting you try out.
Jonathan, come here.

215
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,669
This is Jonathan. He holds
for our main kicker, Joshua Webster.

216
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,715
Jonathan, this is David Childers.
He wants to try out as a kicker.

217
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,802
- Why don't you two go and try a few kicks?
- All right, sure.

218
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,389
Thank you, sir. I'll just hang around
till practice is over.

219
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,225
No problem. Good to meet you.

220
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,269
Y'all just move here?

221
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,440
Yeah, from Athens. My dad got a job
teaching at the college.

222
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,900
That's cool.

223
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:37,321
I'm used to kicking soccer balls,
but I thought I could at least try out.

224
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,449
Josh is a pretty good kicker,
but he's also a receiver.

225
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:44,036
I think he likes that
better than kicking. Here you go.

226
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,133
I'm sorry.

227
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,637
I'm sorry.

228
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,557
I'm sorry.

229
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,605
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

230
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,614
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

231
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,211
Matt.

232
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,839
Matt.

233
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,885
- Let's go.
- I'm going with Brock for a while.

234
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,179
- Not tonight. You're coming home.
- Why?

235
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:48,058
- Don't argue with me. Let's go.
- No, Dad. I'll be home later.

236
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:49,434
Matt.

237
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:11,540
That old man still come every week
to pray in the hallway?

238
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:15,460
Mr. Bridges. Prays for the students
as he passes their locker.

239
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:21,425
- How long has he been doing that?
- Praying for revival since before I got here.

240
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,180
Lord knows we need it. Apathy in the
school's as bad as our football record.

241
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,350
That reminds me. I think you should go ahead
and let David Childers on the team.

242
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,315
- You see something there?
- He's just used to playing soccer.

243
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,234
He ain't that strong,
but he shows promise.

244
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,572
All right. I'll give him a shot.

245
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,295
One, two, hit!

246
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:10,599
What are you doing?
Let's stay in the game!

247
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,982
No! No!

248
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,491
Will someone tell me
how we lost to Dewey County 21 to 7?

249
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,452
21 to 7!

250
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:34,790
Dewey County hasn't beaten Shiloh
since you were in kindergarten!

251
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:39,920
I don't know what you call that junk
out there, but it sure wasn't football.

252
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,006
Nine dropped passes,
four fumbles, three interceptions.

253
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,425
Their defense
scored most of their points!

254
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,345
You gave the game away!

255
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,432
You can't win football games
if you don't play together as a team.

256
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,645
You can't win when you're more concerned
about what you're doing afterwards!

257
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:02,192
And you can't learn the plays when you miss
practice 'cause you're sittin' in detention.

258
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,821
I'm sick of the apathy on this team.

259
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:10,075
If we're not here to win football games,
then why are we here?

260
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,166
So, do you agree with him?

261
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,712
I don't know. I guess.

262
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,340
Only a few guys on the team
really seem to care.

263
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:27,676
So are you ready to play in the game?

264
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:31,221
I don't know why they would use me
when they've got Joshua Webster.

265
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,016
He can kick a 45-yard field goal.

266
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,726
I bet you could too.

267
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:39,479
Dad, I can barely kick
a 35-yard field goal.

268
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,733
At the end of the game,
kind of glad I didn't play.

269
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,652
That way, I can't mess up.

270
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:49,656
- That's fear, son.
- I just don't wanna embarrass the team.

271
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,828
David, I've asked God
since you were a baby

272
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:58,332
that he would show how strong he is
in your life

273
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:02,169
and that through you
people would see how good he is.

274
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,798
Then why would he make me
so small and weak?

275
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,009
To show how mighty he is.

276
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:15,182
Why don't we get washed up for dinner?
We can finish this later.

277
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,267
All right.

278
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,406
Dad.

279
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,494
OK. I'm OK.

280
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,163
- What were you doing?
- You missed a spot up there.

281
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,624
Thought I could get it for you.

282
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,377
I guess I got a little too ambitious.

283
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,463
I was just trying to take a swing at it.

284
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,395
So, what does that mean?

285
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,566
Is there a procedure?
What are my options?

286
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,696
Grant, first you need you realize
this is a fairly common problem for men.

287
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:57,534
Thousands of couples are unable
to have children. You do have options.

288
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,662
Although there's only
a 10% chance of success,

289
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,832
many couples have tried
in vitro fertilization.

290
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:08,879
- We can't afford that.
- The other option is to adopt a child.

291
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,673
But it's about as expensive either way.

292
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:16,428
If you're interested, I'll put you
in touch with the local agency.

293
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,973
I realize this is difficult
for you to hear,

294
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,559
but you and your wife can
make the best decision

295
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,270
now that you know where you are.

296
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,037
Sorry. I didn't realize
anybody was still here.

297
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,457
- Hey, Steve.
- Putting in late hours tonight?

298
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:49,002
Yeah, I guess so.
I can lock up. You can take off.

299
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,088
All right. Thanks, Coach.

300
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,917
It's about the boys.

301
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,128
I'm not asking you to throw him out.

302
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:35,632
If Shiloh can invest in a winning coach,
we don't need to settle for second best.

303
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,218
You can let him go
with as much class as you want to.

304
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,763
- Alvin, he's a good man.
- I'm not saying he's not a good man.

305
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:44,099
I'm saying he's not a good coach.

306
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:48,228
Come on, Dan. Just look at the facts.
His record speaks for itself.

307
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:52,232
- We need new leadership.
- I still think he deserves more time.

308
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:57,112
He's had six years. If he was capable
of winning, he'd have done it by now.

309
00:28:57,196 --> 00:28:59,740
Grant Taylor is not capable of winning.

310
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,910
He doesn't have it in him.
That's the whole point.

311
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:07,247
I'm just saying I want my son to have
the best football program possible.

312
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,958
My son's got a chance
for a football scholarship

313
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,294
if he's taught by the right coach.

314
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,379
Matt's gonna be a senior next year.

315
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:17,466
I don't wanna see him
lose this opportunity.

316
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:22,095
Brady, you're awfully quiet.
What's your take on this?

317
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,681
Honestly, I don't know.

318
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:29,144
Sometimes I think Grant could do a better job
of building this football program.

319
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:33,941
But then other times I think he's doing
just as good as anyone else would.

320
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,568
You could do better.

321
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,862
- What we need is a change.
- Now.

322
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:42,199
We're losing booster support,
game attendance is down,

323
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,869
and from the looks of it
we've already lost this season.

324
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,831
Dan, we've got a weak program
because we've got a weak coach.

325
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:53,168
He's dead weight.
We need to cut him loose.

326
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:08,433
Have you been at school all this time?

327
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,185
Yes.

328
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,273
I tried to call you an hour ago.
Is everything all right?

329
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,532
Grant, talk to me.

330
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,581
I don't know where to start.

331
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,376
What's going on?

332
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,425
I was trying to lock up for Steve

333
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,136
and I overheard Dan
meeting with some fathers.

334
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,099
They didn't know I was there.

335
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:56,064
Brooke, they're pushing him
to get rid of me.

336
00:30:56,148 --> 00:31:01,069
Neil Prater, Alvin Pervis, Luke Rae.

337
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,994
They said I wasn't capable of winning,
called me dead weight.

338
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,331
They can't make Dan fire you.
You've still got support.

339
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:16,877
You just go get JT and Brady
and see him tomorrow.

340
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,129
Brady was there.

341
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:28,222
They've just lost confidence in me.

342
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:36,897
I was so sure I could turn this program
around and I've just sunk it lower.

343
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:44,279
Brooke, I've tried so hard.
Why can't I win?

344
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:48,492
You can win.
Stop beating yourself up, Grant.

345
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:52,037
Brooke, I can't provide you
with a decent home.

346
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:55,707
I can't provide you with a decent car.

347
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,794
I'm a failing coach
with a losing record.

348
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,508
And I can't give you
the children you want.

349
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,970
What?

350
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,224
It's me.

351
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,060
Like everything else is me.

352
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:21,483
We can't have our own children
because of me.

353
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:27,656
What's God doing?
I mean, why is it so hard?

354
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,828
It's OK, Grant.

355
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,956
It's OK.

356
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,386
I love you, O Lord, my strength."

357
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,765
The Lord is my rock and my fortress,
my deliverer,

358
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,393
my God in whom I trust,

359
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:24,606
my shield and the horn of my salvation,
my stronghold."

360
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,277
I will call upon the Lord
who is worthy to be praised."

361
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,363
So shall I be saved from my enemies."

362
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,034
Lord Jesus, would you help me?

363
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,120
I need you.

364
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,833
Lord, I feel like
there's giants of fear and failure

365
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,919
just staring down at me
waiting to crush me.

366
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,755
And I don't know how to beat 'em, Lord.

367
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:51,341
I'm tired of being afraid.

368
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:57,723
Lord, if you want me
to do something else, show me.

369
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:02,561
If you don't want me to have children,
so be it.

370
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,314
But you're my guide.

371
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,691
You're on the throne.

372
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,029
You can have
my hopes and my dreams.

373
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:18,035
Lord, give me something.
Show me something.

374
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:50,108
If the Lord never gives us children,
will you still love him?

375
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,256
Field-goal unit.

376
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:16,927
Hold on, Joshua. I wanna give David
a shot at this one. David, come here.

377
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:19,930
This is your field goal.
Put us on the board.

378
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,032
Hit.

379
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,542
It's all right, man. It's hard.
You'll get it next time.

380
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:04,016
Dad, I don't even know
why they let me on the team.

381
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:05,601
Did you do your best, son?

382
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,020
I knew I was gonna miss it
before I kicked it.

383
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:11,940
Your actions will always
follow your beliefs, David.

384
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,443
Dad, I can't even kick it straight.

385
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:19,281
And I can't walk. Should I just
stay home and pout about it?

386
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:23,493
If you accept defeat, David,
then that's what you'll get.

387
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,960
Well, Brady, another fine example

388
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:35,339
of Grant Taylor's
wonderful coaching abilities.

389
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,675
Look, the kids don't deserve it.
The fans don't deserve it.

390
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,053
When you gonna get
a bellyful of this guy?

391
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,680
What's it gonna take?
You got a chance, man.

392
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,892
You got a chance to step in
and take over this program

393
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,186
and carry it up for a while.

394
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,605
When are you gonna get
sick and tired of it?

395
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:55,108
You got an opportunity here.
This program's going in the tank.

396
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,194
Ryker's gotta...

397
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,711
Grant, he came to me.

398
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,467
You're not doing anybody any favors
sitting on the fence.

399
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:23,804
You determine which side
you wanna be on and stay on it.

400
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,907
Mr. Bridges.

401
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,536
Revelation Chapter 3 says:

402
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:51,123
We serve a God
that opens doors that no one can shut,

403
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:54,418
and he shuts doors
that no one can open."

404
00:38:54,543 --> 00:39:00,382
He says: 'Behold, I have placed before
you an open door that no one can shut.

405
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,718
'I know you have a little strength,

406
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:07,055
yet you have kept my word
and have not denied my name."'

407
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:12,311
Coach Taylor,
the Lord is not through with you yet.

408
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,897
You still have an open door here,

409
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,651
and until the Lord moves you, you're
to bloom right where you're planted.

410
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:24,364
I just felt led
to come and tell you that today.

411
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,421
Mr. Bridges.

412
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,927
Do you believe
God told you to come tell me that?

413
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,970
I do.

414
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:52,142
I admit to you I have been struggling.

415
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:55,103
But I've also been praying.

416
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:58,982
I just don't see him at work here.

417
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:04,613
Grant, I heard a story about two farmers
who desperately needed rain.

418
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,949
And both of them prayed for rain,

419
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:11,453
but only one of them went out
and prepared his fields to receive it.

420
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:15,916
Which one do you think trusted God
to send the rain?

421
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:19,503
The one who prepared his fields for it.

422
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,755
Which one are you?

423
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,341
God will send the rain when he's ready.

424
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:27,886
You need to prepare your field
to receive it.

425
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,686
So this is your new team philosophy?

426
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,730
What do you think?

427
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:23,358
I think this applies to all of life,
not just football.

428
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:25,944
Well, that's my point.

429
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:31,366
10 bucks to the person who can tell me who
won the state championship a decade ago.

430
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,285
- Walker Jennings.
- No.

431
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,537
- North Metro.
- Stop guessing.

432
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,165
You know it or you don't.

433
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,084
- How about five years ago?
- Richland?

434
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,879
That was three years ago.

435
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:47,049
You can't remember, can you?

436
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,176
Leads me to ask a couple of questions.

437
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:53,972
- What's the purpose of this team?
- Win ball games.

438
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,518
- Then what?
- We get a trophy. And people talk about us.

439
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,895
Maybe, for a while.

440
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,314
- Then what?
- I don't know.

441
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:07,444
Get a scholarship, play for college
and coach Little League.

442
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,491
What are you getting at?
You think we're just wasting our time?

443
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,743
If our main goal is to win games,
then yes.

444
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:18,455
- You don't want us to win games?
- No.

445
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,333
Not if that's our main goal.

446
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,753
Winning football games
is too small a thing to live for.

447
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:27,422
And I love football as much as anybody.

448
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:31,760
But even championship trophies will
one day collect dust and be forgotten.

449
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,723
It's just that so far
all this has been about us,

450
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,644
how we can look good,
how we can get the glory.

451
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:47,901
The more I read this book,
the more I realize life's not about us.

452
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,780
We're not here just to get glory,
make money and die.

453
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:54,908
The Bible says
that God put us here for him,

454
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,536
to honor him.

455
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:00,289
Jesus said the most important thing
you could do with your life

456
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:04,126
is to love God with everything you are
and love others as yourself.

457
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:08,714
So if we win every game
and we miss that, we've done nothing.

458
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,258
Football then means nothing.

459
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:15,596
So I'm here to present you
a new team philosophy.

460
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,308
I think that football is just
one of the tools we use to honor God.

461
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,852
So you think God
does care about football?

462
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,605
I think he cares about your faith.

463
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,857
He cares about where your heart is.

464
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:28,942
If you can live your faith on the football field,

465
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:32,279
then, yes, God cares
'cause he cares about you.

466
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:35,532
He sent his son Jesus to die for us
so we could live for him.

467
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,492
That's why we're here.

468
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,330
But, see,
it's not just on the football field.

469
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:44,082
We've gotta honor him
in our relationships,

470
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:49,296
in our respect for authority,
in the classroom,

471
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:53,342
and when you're at home alone
surfing the internet.

472
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:01,308
I want God to bless this team so much,
people talk about what he did.

473
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,685
But it means we gotta give him our best
in every area.

474
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,856
And if we win, we praise him.
And if we lose, we praise him.

475
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:13,195
Either way, we honor him
with our actions and our attitudes.

476
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,782
So I'm asking you,
what are you living for?

477
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,329
I've resolved to give God
everything I've got,

478
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:25,415
then I'll leave the results up to him.

479
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,211
I wanna know if you'll join me.

480
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,382
Your attitude's like the aroma
of your heart.

481
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:37,636
If your attitude stinks,
it means your heart's not right.

482
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,930
He sure is preachy today.

483
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,727
What?

484
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:49,398
- How's your attitude, Brock?
- It's fine.

485
00:44:49,523 --> 00:44:52,734
Then you'll be OK
with the death crawl, right?

486
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,779
All right, everybody on the goal line.
Get your partner. Let's go.

487
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:59,366
All right, let's go. Show me something.
10 yards. Move it. Let's go.

488
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:03,745
Matt, let's go. Let's go, Jonathan.
Show me something. 10 yards.

489
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:07,291
Show me some power. No knees.
Keep your knees off the ground.

490
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:10,752
Show me something. Here we go.
10 yards. Show me some muscle.

491
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:14,214
Show me some power.
Give me some heart. Let's go.

492
00:45:14,298 --> 00:45:18,218
Very good, boys. Very good.
Let's run it back.

493
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,768
- Man, that's not even funny, dude.
- Yeah, it is.

494
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,605
So, Coach,
how strong is Westview this year?

495
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,357
A lot stronger than we are.

496
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:35,652
You already written Friday night down
as a loss, Brock?

497
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,946
Well, not if I knew we could beat 'em.

498
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:43,827
Come here, Brock. You too, Jeremy.

499
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:47,331
- What? Am I in trouble now?
- Not yet.

500
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:52,586
I wanna see you do the death crawl again
except I wanna see your absolute best.

501
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,714
What? You want me to go the 30?

502
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,092
- I think you can go the 50.
- The 50?

503
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:01,178
I can go the 50 if nobody's on my back.

504
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:05,933
You can do it with Jeremy on your back,
but promise you're gonna do your best.

505
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,977
- All right.
- Your best.

506
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:11,897
- OK.
- You're gonna give me your best?

507
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:15,234
- I'm gonna give you my best.
- All right, one more thing.

508
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,611
- I want you to do it blindfolded.
- Why?

509
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,740
I don't want you giving up at a certain
point when you can go further. Get down.

510
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,368
Jeremy, get on his back.

511
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,288
Now, get a good tight hold, Jeremy.

512
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,041
All right. Let's go, Brock.

513
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:34,127
Keep your knees off the ground.
Just your hands and feet.

514
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:37,130
A little bit left. A little bit left.

515
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,675
There you go. Show me good effort.

516
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:44,054
Thataway, Brock. You keep coming.

517
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,475
- There you go.
- Come on, Brock.

518
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:51,770
- Come on.
- It's a good start. Little bit left.

519
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,690
Little bit left. There you go, Brock.

520
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,277
Good strength.

521
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:03,574
You gotta be kidding me.

522
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:07,452
- That's it, Brock. That's it.
- Am I at the 20 yet?

523
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:11,248
Forget the 20. You give me your best.
You keep going. That's it.

524
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,458
Don't stop.
You got more in you than that.

525
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,544
I ain't done. I'm resting a second.

526
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:19,173
You gotta keep moving. Let's go.
Don't quit till you got nothing left.

527
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:22,843
There you go. Keep moving. Keep moving.

528
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:25,429
Keep moving.
That's it. You keep driving.

529
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:29,558
Keep your knees off the ground.
Keep driving it. Your very best.

530
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:34,313
Your very best. Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

531
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:37,482
Keep going.
Don't quit on me. Keep going.

532
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:40,944
Keep driving it. Keep your knees
off the ground. That's it.

533
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,031
Your very best.
Don't quit on me. Your very best.

534
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:47,534
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

535
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,913
That's it. You keep driving.
Keep your knees off the ground.

536
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,707
Don't quit till you got nothing left.

537
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,877
Keep moving, Brock.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

538
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,631
Keep going. I want everything you got.
Come on, keep going.

539
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:04,426
- It hurts.
- Don't quit on me. Your very best.

540
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:08,972
Keep driving. Keep driving.
There you go. There you go.

541
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,557
- He's heavy.
- I know.

542
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:13,393
- I'm about out of strength.
- Then find more strength.

543
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,522
Don't you give up on me, Brock.
You keep going, you hear me?

544
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:20,484
You're doing good. You keep going.
Do not quit on me. You keep going.

545
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,779
- It hurts.
- I know it hurts. You keep going.

546
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:28,325
It's all heart from here. 30 more steps.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

547
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,952
- Keep going.
- It burns.

548
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:31,912
- Let it burn.
- My arms are burning.

549
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,498
It's all heart.
You keep going, Brock. Come on.

550
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:38,961
Come on. Keep going.
You promised me your best. Your best.

551
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:41,171
- Don't stop. Keep going.
- It's too hard.

552
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,132
It's not too hard.
You keep going. Come on, Brock.

553
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:47,135
Give me more. Give me more. Keep going.

554
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,471
20 more steps. 20 more.

555
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:53,100
Keep going, Brock.
Give me your best. Don't quit.

556
00:48:53,225 --> 00:48:55,978
No. Keep going. Keep going.

557
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:59,565
Keep going. Don't quit. Don't quit.

558
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,651
Don't quit.
Brock Kelley, you don't quit.

559
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:04,736
Keep going. Keep going.

560
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:09,157
Go, Brock Kelley. You don't quit on me.
No, you keep going.

561
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,577
You keep going. Go, Brock.

562
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,662
10 more steps. 10 more.

563
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,747
10 more. 10 more.

564
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:18,750
Keep going. Don't quit.
Give me your heart.

565
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,670
- I can't do it.
- You can. You can.

566
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,755
Five more. Five more.

567
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:27,843
Come on, Brock. Come on.
Don't quit. Don't quit.

568
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:31,805
Come on. Two more. One more.

569
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:40,606
That's gotta be 50. That's gotta be 50.
I don't have any more.

570
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:48,322
Look up, Brock. You're in the end zone.

571
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:57,915
Brock, you are the most
influential player on this team.

572
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,376
If you walk around defeated, so will they.

573
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,922
Tell me you can't give me more
than what I've been seeing.

574
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:10,511
You just carried a 140-pound man
across this whole field on your arms.

575
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,140
Brock, I need you.

576
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:18,894
God's gifted you with the ability
of leadership. Don't waste it.

577
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:22,981
- Coach.
- Can I count on you?

578
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:27,778
Yes.

579
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,156
Coach.

580
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,952
- What is it, Jeremy?
- I weigh 160.

581
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:57,850
All right. Who's next?

582
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:06,149
Good practice, boys.
See you all tomorrow.

583
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:09,945
Hey, man, for the first time in a while,
I actually feel good about Friday night.

584
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,657
- Yeah? Why?
- I'm just on board with what you're doing.

585
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:16,702
If they get ahold of it,
it'll change their lives.

586
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,787
You count me in.

587
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,294
Grant, me too.

588
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,130
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,674
I feel like I owe you an apology.

590
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,594
I just want you to know
that I'm with you.

591
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,723
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

592
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:57,826
- You need a ride, Matt?
- No, my dad's coming.

593
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,579
Or at least, he'd better be.

594
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,832
Can I shoot straight with you
for a minute?

595
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:07,127
- Sure.
- I feel like you owe your dad more respect.

596
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,546
- Why?
- 'Cause he's your father.

597
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,257
- You don't know him like I know him.
- I don't have to.

598
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:14,885
You need to respect him
because it's the right thing.

599
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,971
You know, Coach,
my dad doesn't even like you.

600
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:21,183
He thinks the school
needs to find somebody else.

601
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:24,561
That's beside the point.
Scripture says to honor your parents.

602
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:27,689
- And all you do is complain.
- All he does is boss me around.

603
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,025
He doesn't even try to understand me.

604
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,404
You can't judge your father by his
actions and yourself by your intentions.

605
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,199
It doesn't work that way.
You're not responsible for him.

606
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:41,411
You're responsible for you. You honor
God by honoring your authority.

607
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:46,041
You really believe in all that honoring
God and follow Jesus stuff?

608
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,544
Yes, I do.

609
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:51,713
Well, I ain't trying to be disrespectful,

610
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,799
but not everybody believes in that.

611
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:58,720
Religion works for some people, but I'm
just here 'cause I got kicked out of Westview.

612
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:01,056
Matt, nobody's forcing anything on you.

613
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,685
Following Jesus Christ is a decision
you're gonna have to make for yourself.

614
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,770
You may not wanna accept him.

615
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:10,566
'Cause he'll change your life.
You'll never be the same.

616
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:14,820
I do hope one day
you realize how much he loves you.

617
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:17,239
I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:30,752
I'll get him. Give me the bag.
Bring that trash bag here. Set it down.

619
00:53:30,836 --> 00:53:34,882
- Don't you let that touch me.
- I'm gonna get him out of here.

620
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:38,594
- Oh, man, he stinks.
- I can't believe that was in my house.

621
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,640
- Just make sure it's still dead.
- It's probably been dead for weeks.

622
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:46,226
You just get it out of here. Out. Out.

623
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,979
- Stop being a... Come here. Look at it.
- No.

624
00:53:49,104 --> 00:53:52,399
It looks like a big hamster.
Come here, come here.

625
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:56,445
Don't be afraid. Just face your fear.
He's got a cute little tail there.

626
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,408
He's just got a big stink.
Look. See his cute little eyes there?

627
00:54:01,491 --> 00:54:05,120
See his teeth? Look at his teeth.
Almost looks like he's mad.

628
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:10,334
You're terrible! I can't believe
you did that to me, Grant Taylor.

629
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,419
You are so bad.

630
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,550
David, right down the middle.
You got this.

631
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,055
Right, set it up. Run it again.

632
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,600
- Sorry, Coach.
- David, listen, son.

633
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:29,853
You act like you're gonna miss
before you even kick the ball.

634
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,731
We're gonna have to change
your kicking philosophy.

635
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:36,443
Now, see, you're kicking wide left
or wide right.

636
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,487
That ain't what's gonna get you home.

637
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:41,323
The ball has got to go
through the middle.

638
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,867
- I know, Coach.
- No, you don't.

639
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,036
Now, what does Scripture say about this?

640
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:50,040
Scripture says, "Wide is the gate

641
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,626
and broad is the way
that leads to destruction,

642
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:54,753
and many there be that find it."

643
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:59,800
Now, to us, that's wide left
and wide right.

644
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,554
But narrow is the gate and straight
is the way that leads to life,

645
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,515
and few there be that find it."

646
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,893
Anybody can kick it
wide left or wide right.

647
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:13,605
My mama can kick it
wide left and wide right.

648
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,567
- But that ain't what's gonna get you home.
- Come on.

649
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:20,028
It don't have to look pretty.
It don't have to look smooth.

650
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:22,155
It can look like a dying duck.

651
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,449
But the ball has to go
through the middle.

652
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:26,535
Oh, my word.

653
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,788
Now, David, you gonna have to choose
the narrow way.

654
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,666
That's the only path
where you will get your reward.

655
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:36,712
Now send this ball through these pearly
posts. Set it up for me, Jonathan.

656
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:41,842
I've never heard it that way before, but
there's a lot of truth to what he's saying.

657
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,261
Let's see you kick it.

658
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:55,689
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

659
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:04,364
Grant, are you not aware
of what's going on outside on the field?

660
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:07,159
- What?
- You might wanna come check this out.

661
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,332
Mitch decided to bring
his Bible class outside today.

662
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,752
Matt Prater stood up
and accepted Christ as his Lord.

663
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:20,047
It was awesome. He started
confessing stuff from his life,

664
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,466
asking his friends for forgiveness.

665
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,802
Next thing we know, Bob Duke stands up
and does the same thing.

666
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:29,097
Kids break up into groups,
they begin to pray for each other,

667
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,725
they ask forgiveness for sins
they've committed.

668
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:36,772
This has been going on for three hours.
How did you not know what was going on?

669
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:12,140
Bless them in a special way.
Lord, I ask you to lift them up to you.

670
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:20,274
I ask you to bring up a generation
that has a heart for you, Lord.

671
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,571
Coach.

672
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:33,704
- I'm proud of you, Matt.
- I need to talk with my dad.

673
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,123
I'd like to go see him.

674
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:39,751
I'll take you right now.

675
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,173
So what we've done here
is we've gained these four lots

676
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:46,425
by moving the retention pond down here.

677
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:51,430
- We could try and do that through here.
- No. I like this. That's perfect.

678
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:54,057
<i>Mr. Prater,</i>
<i>there's someone here to see you.</i>

679
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:57,144
- Sarah, I'm in a meeting.
- <i>It's your son.</i>

680
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,440
- Would you like me to step out?
- No, it's OK.

681
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:04,067
Sarah, send him in.

682
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:12,951
- Matt, you OK?
- Sorry. I didn't know you were in a meeting.

683
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:15,370
What is it, son?

684
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:20,709
Dad, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

685
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:23,795
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting.

686
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:27,799
I got right with God today

687
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:29,885
and I just needed to say

688
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,389
that from now on
I'll respect your authority.

689
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:37,142
Whatever you say goes.

690
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,979
That's it.

691
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:47,152
You know, I could come back tomorrow
if that would be better for you.

692
00:58:47,277 --> 00:58:50,155
No. It's OK.

693
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,366
I'm sorry. I...

694
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,340
For what it's worth,

695
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:12,386
I'd give my right arm
to hear my son say that to me.

696
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:22,563
I feel like I'm standing
before a new team tonight.

697
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,899
It's a new day and a new game.

698
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:30,070
What you've experienced in your hearts
this week will be released on the field.

699
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:32,739
Stay humble but confident.

700
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:36,535
Why don't you take this one, Brock?

701
00:59:39,997 --> 00:59:42,666
Lord, we know
our lives are not about football,

702
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,460
but we do thank you
for allowing us to play tonight.

703
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:47,838
We're gonna give you our best.

704
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:51,550
If we win, we'll praise you
and if we lose, we'll praise you.

705
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:55,220
We'll give you all the honor and the glory
for this night. Keep us safe.

706
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:57,639
- Amen.
- Amen.

707
00:59:57,723 --> 01:00:00,309
All right, guys. Look at me.

708
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:02,978
Play hard, have fun.

709
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,528
Hit.

710
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:11,255
In the Old Testament,
Nehemiah had the task of

711
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,966
building a wall around his city
for protection.

712
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:17,177
But he didn't have enough people
or resources or time.

713
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:20,305
Because each person worked on the wall
in front of their house,

714
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,642
they got it done in record time.
That's what you're gonna do.

715
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,896
On defense you have to resolve
nothing gets by you as an individual,

716
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,982
nothing gets by us as a team.

717
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,568
I need you to build me a stone wall.

718
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:22,075
Let's go. Let's go.

719
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:24,620
Run through
like you're throwing yourself.

720
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:29,666
Come on. Hit somebody! I wanna see
some hitting. I wanna see some hitting.

721
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:33,504
Dig those feet. Come on, you ain't
on my team yet. You ain't on my defense.

722
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:37,174
You gotta dig those feet.
All right, Prater. Get in there, boy.

723
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,301
Hit him a little harder than that.

724
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:42,387
This ain't ballet practice.
This is football practice.

725
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,670
David.

726
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:15,963
David.

727
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:37,943
Double sweep pitch lift. Pro 45 fix.
Man, even a 26 Powerhouse.

728
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:41,154
- Man, these are some good plays.
- We're gonna run 'em.

729
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:44,199
We got all type of potential
on this sheet. When?

730
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:45,868
We're gonna run 'em, I promise.

731
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:50,998
See, you always tell me you're gonna
run 'em. You don't wanna run my plays.

732
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:53,792
Where's my car?

733
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:57,462
- Where'd you park it?
- Right here.

734
01:03:57,588 --> 01:04:01,008
You sure?
'Cause there ain't no way it got stolen.

735
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:03,385
You couldn't pay nobody
to steal your car.

736
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:07,139
- Did the boys do something with it?
- I don't know.

737
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:10,225
Hey, man,
there's a note on this truck for you.

738
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:14,188
- What does it say?
- Let's see.

739
01:04:14,271 --> 01:04:17,608
It says "Grant Taylor,
the impact you made on our school

740
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:19,902
means more to us
than you'll ever know.

741
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,529
The Lord has used you
to meet a need in our lives

742
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,615
and now we want
to meet a need in yours.

743
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:28,243
You'll find the title
of this new truck in your name.

744
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:31,663
Please accept it
as our way of saying thank you."

745
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,503
Somebody done gave you a truck?

746
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,678
Man, this title got your name on it.

747
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:58,106
You got to be kidding me.

748
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:06,782
Grant Taylor,
somebody done gave you a new truck.

749
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,286
This is my truck?

750
01:05:27,553 --> 01:05:30,055
Is this just 'cause you head coach?

751
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,933
'Cause I'm assistant coach.

752
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:36,311
You'd think I'd get a moped
out of this or something.

753
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,156
Oh, Lord, you've given me a truck.

754
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:52,202
Well, it's your truck. Drive it.

755
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:58,125
Not a word to anyone.

756
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,419
Yes, sir.

757
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,846
That right.
No more jumper cables.

758
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,605
Brock. Brock.

759
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:23,650
- You watch him. You watch him.
- Sure.

760
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,459
- Go.
- Go. Go.

761
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:41,937
- Yes, sir? Can I help you?
- Please.

762
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:45,941
I'd like to buy a nice bouquet
of wild flowers for my wife.

763
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:48,485
I see.
That's awfully sweet of you.

764
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:52,447
Oh, yes. I've got a special evening
in mind for her tonight.

765
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:55,367
In that case, you need a card
to go with those flowers.

766
01:07:55,492 --> 01:08:00,247
I've got the perfect one. I'm gonna give
it to her at her favorite restaurant.

767
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,041
Really? I'm sure she'll be happy.

768
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:08,964
She will. So I need your nicest,
largest flowers, and money's no object.

769
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:14,303
- You see, I got a raise today.
- You did?

770
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:17,764
- $6,000.
- Are you serious?

771
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,142
That's the way my wife's gonna respond.

772
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,894
Grant.

773
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:24,271
Grant.

774
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:28,358
- That's awesome.
- You sure got friendly service here.

775
01:08:35,115 --> 01:08:38,577
Hello again. This is Lane Lavarre,
along with Dale Hansen,

776
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:41,622
coming to you tonight
from Princeton Heights Academy,

777
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:45,125
the site of tonight's opening round
of the GISA football playoffs.

778
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,085
For the first time in a decade,

779
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:49,796
the Shiloh Eagles
are in postseason play.

780
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,382
Coach Grant Taylor's
gonna have his hands full

781
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:56,887
as he takes on the Panthers,
who haven't lost a game all season.

782
01:08:57,012 --> 01:09:00,390
Huddle up. Stay sharp, stay focused,
play hard and honor God.

783
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,976
- Eagles on three. One, two, three.
- Eagles.

784
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:42,182
<i>So, after an impressive record,</i>

785
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:46,436
<i>the Shiloh Eagles fall short tonight</i>
<i>in the first round of the GISA playoffs.</i>

786
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:50,899
28 to 10, the Princeton Heights Panthers
take it to the Shiloh Eagles.

787
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:55,237
I knew we were gonna get killed tonight.

788
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:11,837
Your effort was good tonight.
You've got nothing to be ashamed of.

789
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:21,096
You played hard. The Shilohs
had their best season in a long time.

790
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,557
God's been good to us this year.

791
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,566
Guys, Coach is right.

792
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:36,528
We gotta praise God when we win
and praise him when we lose.

793
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:42,075
Let's take a knee.

794
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:59,218
Hey.

795
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:08,310
I wish by some miracle
we could have won tonight.

796
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:12,397
They worked too hard
to walk away with their heads down.

797
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:18,237
I was hoping God would give us
just one win in the playoffs.

798
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,825
They deserved it.

799
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:36,213
If you'd told me two months ago we'd
play Princeton Heights in the playoffs,

800
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,173
I would not have believed you.

801
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:42,886
If you'd told me our school was having
a revival, I wouldn't have believed you.

802
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,472
- This ain't been a bad year.
- Got all the jerseys?

803
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:50,227
All 32 of 'em. But I ain't ready to put
'em up. I'm ready to go another round.

804
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:53,313
You and me both.
Part of me wanted to get to state.

805
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:57,776
- To state? Grant, are you serious?
- Why not? As hard as they worked?

806
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,863
Working hard is one thing,
but to take this team to state?

807
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:04,366
- That'd take an act of God.
- Has he not been acting already?

808
01:12:04,449 --> 01:12:08,328
He has, but do you know who's gonna
be waiting for whoever gets to state?

809
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,914
- The Richland Giants.
- That's right.

810
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,876
Bobby Lee Duke will be there
with his 85 players

811
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:18,130
ready to spank whoever made it
to the state playoffs to kingdom come.

812
01:12:18,255 --> 01:12:21,049
- I'm not afraid.
- I know you're not afraid.

813
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,801
'Cause you ain't going.

814
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:25,304
By the way,
some man called looking for you.

815
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:28,974
- Who?
- Stan Shultz.

816
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:31,518
- Stan Shultz?
- Yeah.

817
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:36,315
- Stan Shultz. That the cartoonist?
- That's Charles Schulz.

818
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,443
Charles Schulz was that man
that flew across the ocean

819
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,320
in the <i>Spirit of St. Andrew</i>.

820
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:44,656
That's Charles Lindbergh,
and it was the <i>Spirit of St. Louis</i>.

821
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:47,492
- Lindbergh is a cheese.
- Limburger's the cheese.

822
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:48,911
Lindbergh's the man.

823
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:53,290
Lindbergh was that blimp that blew up
and killed all them people.

824
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:57,211
That's the <i>Hindenburg</i>.

825
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:03,091
No, Hindenburg
is where you go skiing in Tennessee.

826
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:05,844
- That's Gatlinburg.
- Gatlinburg...

827
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:09,348
You mean like the country music group,
the Gatlinburg Brothers?

828
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:13,602
You guys are crazy.

829
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:17,397
Grant Taylor.

830
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:21,860
Well, Mr. Shultz,
I was told you were looking for me.

831
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:25,781
Yes. Am I sitting down?
Why do you ask?

832
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,994
Hey, Coach, what's going on here?

833
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,081
- Coach is on his way to let us know.
- All right.

834
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,002
Bring it in.

835
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:48,095
I want you to know I serve a big God
and he can do whatever he wants to do.

836
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,848
He can open what he wants to
and shut what he wants to.

837
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:55,310
A team that plays for his honor
and glory will have his blessings.

838
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:59,606
Unlike those who try to cheat their way
to the top, like Princeton Heights did

839
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:02,317
when they played
two ineligible 19-year-olds.

840
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,445
They have been disqualified
and we're in the next round.

841
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:10,325
Get your pads on for practice. We're
going to war with Tucker Friday night.

842
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:22,421
<i>Welcome to the GISA quarterfinals.</i>

843
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:25,966
Who would have thought we'd be seeing
the Shiloh Eagles tonight

844
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:28,135
in a contest against the Tucker Tigers?

845
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:30,262
With Princeton Heights disqualified,

846
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,806
this is an early Christmas present
for Shiloh.

847
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:35,851
Offense, put it in the end zone.
Defense, build me a wall.

848
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:38,478
- Eagles on three. One, two, three.
- Eagles.

849
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:45,777
Blue, 18. Blue, 18.

850
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:48,280
Set. Hit. Hit.

851
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:16,642
David. This is your field goal.
It belongs to you. Put it through.

852
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:24,691
David.

853
01:15:27,194 --> 01:15:28,904
Hit.

854
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:33,992
Yes.

855
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:39,498
The Tucker Tigers
are nursing their wounds

856
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:41,625
as they face the end of their season.

857
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,711
The Eagles, however,
have a little farther to fly.

858
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,215
What kind of sick are we talking about?

859
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:51,260
I've just felt really nauseous
the last two mornings.

860
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:55,180
- And then I feel fine again.
- You haven't eaten anything weird?

861
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:57,432
Not unless fruit and cereal's weird.

862
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:02,646
Brooke, my gut says make an appointment
with the doctor.

863
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:07,067
I've been there three times this year.
It's getting embarrassing.

864
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,279
I'm just telling you what I would do.
You can even use my car.

865
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:18,954
<i>With five seconds left, the score</i>
<i>still stands in Oakhaven's favor</i>

866
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:20,998
<i>17 to 14 over the Eagles.</i>

867
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:23,250
<i>Grant Taylor calls the play</i>
<i>to Zach Avery,</i>

868
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:26,628
<i>who pulls the huddle together</i>
<i>for their last shot at going to state.</i>

869
01:16:26,753 --> 01:16:30,257
<i>It's third down and goal for the Eagles</i>
<i>and the crowd is going crazy.</i>

870
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:33,969
<i>They line up in an "i" formation.</i>
<i>This is do or die for the Eagles.</i>

871
01:16:34,052 --> 01:16:37,264
<i>Zach takes the snap and will give it</i>
<i>to Jacob... No, it's a fake.</i>

872
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:41,310
<i>He's got Nathan Markle open in the</i>
<i>corner. The pass is up... He's got it.</i>

873
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:44,605
<i>Touchdown Eagles. Touchdown Eagles.</i>

874
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:50,027
<i>Zach Avery faked out the defense</i>
<i>and made a perfect pass to win 20 to 17.</i>

875
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:55,574
<i>Can you believe this? The Shiloh Eagles</i>
<i>are headed to the state championship.</i>

876
01:16:55,699 --> 01:17:00,495
<i>A team with only 32 players</i>
<i>has made it to the big dance. Oh, my.</i>

877
01:17:00,579 --> 01:17:03,498
On the eve of the GISA
football state championship,

878
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:08,253
the Richland Giants prepare to defend
their reign as lords of the gridiron.

879
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,631
It's no surprise they've returned.

880
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:13,884
What is surprising is
who they're playing, the Shiloh Eagles,

881
01:17:14,009 --> 01:17:17,179
who started the season 0 and 3,
have come out of nowhere,

882
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:19,723
and through a bizarre
set of circumstances

883
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:22,935
now face a team
almost three times their size.

884
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:34,279
Sleep at all last night?

885
01:17:36,907 --> 01:17:39,159
Are you nervous?

886
01:17:39,243 --> 01:17:40,911
It's a weird emotion.

887
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:44,540
Part of me thinks
we're gonna get crushed tonight,

888
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:47,251
part of me thinks
God may do something awesome.

889
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:50,546
Sounds like your fear's
about to clobber your faith.

890
01:17:52,798 --> 01:17:55,008
Something like that.

891
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,719
When are you going out there?

892
01:17:57,803 --> 01:18:00,138
I might leave early,
if that's all right.

893
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:02,933
Don't worry about me.
I'll just meet you at the game.

894
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,185
OK.

895
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:10,858
Either way, you're still playing
for a state championship.

896
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:35,924
- Where's the duck?
- Duck.

897
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:38,343
- Zebra.
- Zebra.

898
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:40,429
Zebra. Cat.

899
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:42,556
- Cat.
- Meow.

900
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:44,224
Meow.

901
01:18:44,349 --> 01:18:48,187
- There's the pig.
- Brooke Taylor's here again.

902
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,565
Maybe she'll be pregnant this time.

903
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,609
I hope so.

904
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:59,281
- <i>You ready, son?</i>
- <i>I can't find my cleats.</i>

905
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,033
<i>They're right here by the door.</i>

906
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:02,409
Thanks.

907
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:09,583
Do you realize you're playing
for the state championship?

908
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:13,629
I don't know why I'm so nervous.
I'm not even gonna play.

909
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:16,715
- You know I'm proud of you, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

910
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,261
Don't ever doubt it. Whether you play
or not, I'll be there praying for you.

911
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:22,721
Thanks, Dad.

912
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:25,474
Let's go pick a fight with some giants.

913
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:31,480
Here's the results for B Taylor.

914
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:33,524
I'll take that.

915
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:38,737
- Negative?
- Yes.

916
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,764
I will still love you, Lord.

917
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:52,895
I will still love you.

918
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:20,315
All right, God. You got us here.

919
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,402
Whatever happens, may you get the glory.

920
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:40,377
- Coach, what are you doing here?
- You're at the state championship.

921
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:43,714
Any time a former player
gets this far, you know I'd be there.

922
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:46,341
- It blows me away.
- How you feeling?

923
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:52,222
A little bit nervous. This championship,
it's kind of surreal for me.

924
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:55,184
Yeah. I don't care
what level of ball you're coaching,

925
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:58,312
it's surreal when you make it
to the championship game.

926
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:01,273
Grant, I'm so proud of you
and what you've done.

927
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:04,234
I've been reading about the team
and where you've gone.

928
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:08,822
I'm just proud of the fact that you
finally learned how to win the big one.

929
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:12,367
- We haven't played 'em yet.
- You won when you accepted Christ.

930
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:17,164
Now, as you're teaching these guys and
minister to 'em, I think it's fantastic.

931
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:20,667
I got it. These players got it.

932
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:24,338
I promise, win or lose this game,
you guys are champions.

933
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:28,634
- I appreciate that.
- But you might as well win it, huh?

934
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:32,679
I'm gonna try my best.
This team we're playing, they're huge.

935
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:36,016
They're fast, strong. I just don't want
my players to be afraid.

936
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:42,481
Well, in God's word, he said
365 different times, "Do not fear."

937
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:46,443
If he says it that many times,
you know he's serious about it.

938
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,820
I guess so. I needed to hear that.

939
01:23:48,946 --> 01:23:51,740
You're gonna do great tonight.
I know you're busy.

940
01:23:51,823 --> 01:23:54,243
- I'm gonna go and cheer you on.
- Good to see you.

941
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:57,746
- All right. God bless you, man.
- Thanks, Coach.

942
01:24:14,763 --> 01:24:17,850
In about five minutes
we head out for the warm-up.

943
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:20,894
I wanna say two things.

944
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:24,439
Number one,
I love you and I'm proud of you.

945
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,442
I wouldn't trade this season
for anything in the world.

946
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:32,322
Secondly, you're about to play
the biggest team you've ever faced.

947
01:24:32,447 --> 01:24:35,242
They're strong, fast and undefeated.

948
01:24:36,535 --> 01:24:38,996
So far.

949
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:42,082
But I want you to remember
where God has brought us.

950
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:44,918
I want you to remember
how hard you've worked.

951
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:48,755
We weren't supposed to have
a winning season, but we do.

952
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:52,718
We weren't supposed to advance
through the playoffs, but we did.

953
01:24:52,843 --> 01:24:56,471
We're not supposed to be here,
but we are.

954
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:59,850
So if anything in you says
this is a losing effort, throw it out.

955
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:03,103
'Cause as I stand here,
I believe that as long as we honor God,

956
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:06,231
nothing is impossible.

957
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,775
Nothing.

958
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:14,823
Leave everything out on the field.
Give your best to God tonight.

959
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:20,537
Whether we leave the field the victors
or not, we will give God the glory.

960
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:25,000
Now, who will go fight
the Giants with me?

961
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:55,322
You've gotta be kidding me.

962
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:15,634
<i>The Giants elect to receive</i>
<i>after the coin toss.</i>

963
01:26:15,717 --> 01:26:18,720
<i>We're seconds away from</i>
<i>the state championship game.</i>

964
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:24,560
It is impressive that Shiloh has made it
this far, but the field looks lopsided.

965
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:26,186
It definitely does.

966
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:30,440
<i>85 players on the Richland sidelines</i>
<i>as opposed to 32 for Shiloh.</i>

967
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:34,319
<i>Even if the Eagles had great talent,</i>
<i>they can't bring in fresh players.</i>

968
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:36,697
That's gonna hurt in the second half.

969
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:38,740
Let's go, Joshua.

970
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:45,455
<i>The Eagles kick it off and the state</i>
<i>championship game is underway.</i>

971
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:49,418
<i>Jerod House will receive the kick</i>
<i>and he'll head down the field.</i>

972
01:26:49,501 --> 01:26:54,256
<i>He breaks outside. But the Eagles will</i>
<i>take him down around the 50-yard line.</i>

973
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:58,177
<i>The Giants will set up shop first down</i>
<i>and ten, in good field position</i>

974
01:26:58,302 --> 01:27:00,429
to start this state championship game.

975
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:02,890
Get out there.

976
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:05,684
Come on. Let's go, boys.

977
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,479
<i>Wes Porter will call the play</i>
<i>for the Giants. He steps back to pass.</i>

978
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:12,191
<i>Damien Fuller's</i>
<i>streaking down the sideline.</i>

979
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:17,487
<i>Fuller will take the pass, untouched,</i>
<i>and the Giants strike early</i>

980
01:27:17,613 --> 01:27:19,406
with the first score.

981
01:27:19,489 --> 01:27:22,284
Welcome to state championship football.

982
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,203
Hey, man, this is a whole new level.

983
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:27,039
They're quick off the line.
We've gotta stay back.

984
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,958
<i>The Eagles will start this drive</i>
<i>at the 19-yard line.</i>

985
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:33,295
<i>Zach Avery drops back</i>
<i>to pass to Jeremy Johnson.</i>

986
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:35,672
<i>But the pass is batted down</i>
<i>by the Giants.</i>

987
01:27:35,797 --> 01:27:37,466
That's the way we do it.

988
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:40,469
<i>Avery hands it to Jacob Hall,</i>
<i>who tries to run</i>

989
01:27:40,552 --> 01:27:44,056
<i>but gets absolutely nowhere</i>
<i>as he is swamped by defenders.</i>

990
01:27:49,144 --> 01:27:51,897
10, 10, hit, hit.

991
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:56,652
<i>The Eagles look to pass,</i>
<i>but here come the Giants.</i>

992
01:27:56,777 --> 01:28:01,156
<i>That's gonna force the Eagles</i>
<i>into a punting situation on fourth down.</i>

993
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:04,076
They're getting desperate.

994
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:10,332
<i>Jerod House will receive the kick</i>
<i>and head down the field.</i>

995
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:13,418
<i>He breaks outside.</i>
<i>He's got some daylight.</i>

996
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:38,026
OK. Ref, timeout.

997
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:44,199
The Eagles give up another sack.
They're gonna have to punt it away.

998
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,159
So far it's been all Richland.

999
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:49,997
- I should not have called that play.
- They're all over us. Nobody's open.

1000
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,875
- They're knocking us around.
- They're getting cocky.

1001
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:56,378
We cannot let them play their game.
Defense, blitz on first down.

1002
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:58,213
We've gotta get them off their rhythm.
Let's go.

1003
01:29:25,449 --> 01:29:26,658
No.

1004
01:29:38,837 --> 01:29:42,049
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1005
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,887
What universe are you in?
Get in the game.

1006
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:54,520
<i>So with a few seconds left</i>
<i>in the first half,</i>

1007
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:57,147
<i>the Giants were gonna</i>
<i>take a three-touchdown lead,</i>

1008
01:29:57,272 --> 01:30:00,901
but after an Eagles interception,
we've got a 14 to 7 football game.

1009
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:09,743
We can't keep running our normal plays.
Their defense is killing us.

1010
01:30:09,868 --> 01:30:14,289
I agree. We cannot outmuscle 'em
and we cannot outrun 'em.

1011
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:16,750
We've gotta outsmart 'em.

1012
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:19,795
- Trick plays?
- Just enough to keep 'em guessing.

1013
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,632
- You see another way?
- We can't use 'em too often, though.

1014
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:27,469
- They catch on, we're toast.
- We're toast if we don't get points.

1015
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:31,640
We have gotta make it through the fourth
quarter and they got a deep bench.

1016
01:30:31,765 --> 01:30:36,103
First, we're still in the game. Good job
on the defense getting us on the board.

1017
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:40,357
They thought this would be a shutout.
We're gonna keep surprising 'em.

1018
01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:43,110
They've got power and speed,
they're big,

1019
01:30:43,193 --> 01:30:45,112
but they're also predictable.

1020
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:48,365
We have gotta stay together.

1021
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,952
We can't outrun 'em,
but we can outsmart 'em.

1022
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:56,957
<i>With the Giants leading 14 to 7,</i>
<i>we get set to bring you the second half</i>

1023
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,625
<i>of this state football game.</i>

1024
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:02,504
<i>Unless the Eagles find a way</i>
<i>to solve Richland's size and strength,</i>

1025
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:07,342
the Giants could be taking home their
fourth consecutive state title tonight.

1026
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:13,849
Make it work, Zach.

1027
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:21,690
<i>The Eagles come out</i>
<i>with a little trickery.</i>

1028
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:25,319
<i>They're just about to tie</i>
<i>this football game.</i>

1029
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:35,495
Hustle, hustle. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1030
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:38,290
Make 'em pay, boys.
Make 'em pay.

1031
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:47,382
Come on. That was dirty.

1032
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:50,552
He's hurt.

1033
01:31:57,768 --> 01:32:00,062
<i>Joshua Webster's</i>
<i>being helped off the field</i>

1034
01:32:00,145 --> 01:32:02,689
with we've been told is
a broken collarbone.

1035
01:32:02,814 --> 01:32:06,860
That came after a late hit by the Giants
after the Eagles tied the game.

1036
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:11,657
- That was dirty.
- Calm down. Josh is gonna be all right.

1037
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:14,660
David, come here.
You gotta cover for Joshua.

1038
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:16,954
- I need 110%, OK?
- All right, Coach.

1039
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:19,039
Be the man. Let's go.

1040
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:38,809
After a long drive, the Giants score,
but the Eagles prevent the conversion,

1041
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:41,061
<i>leaving this a 20 to 14 football game.</i>

1042
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:44,731
Why are they on the scoreboard?
They shouldn't even be in this game.

1043
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:47,442
For the rest of your life,
you will remember today.

1044
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:50,779
I want you to remember you held
nothing back, did not lose heart,

1045
01:32:50,863 --> 01:32:53,323
you did not stop fighting,
you did not quit.

1046
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:56,201
They're like little dogs
nipping at your heels.

1047
01:32:56,285 --> 01:32:58,579
Now get out there and stomp 'em.

1048
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:06,086
That's what I'm talking about.
That's my defense.

1049
01:33:07,838 --> 01:33:10,632
Let's go, Eagles. He's going for a pass.

1050
01:33:16,805 --> 01:33:20,767
<i>The Eagles have shown the determination</i>
<i>of a school twice their size.</i>

1051
01:33:20,893 --> 01:33:26,231
The Giants will now attempt a 35-yard
field goal to extend their lead.

1052
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:30,652
That is the last time
we go for a field goal.

1053
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:33,780
We should be in the end zone
every stinkin' time.

1054
01:33:33,864 --> 01:33:37,409
Double flex wall. Double flex wall.

1055
01:33:46,668 --> 01:33:48,629
And hit.

1056
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:07,272
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. Let's go.

1057
01:34:07,356 --> 01:34:10,776
- Let's go.
- Good job. That's my team.

1058
01:34:10,901 --> 01:34:14,363
Coach, I need a rest.
I can't go much more.

1059
01:34:14,488 --> 01:34:17,866
Brock, I need you on that field.
You have gotta stay in the game.

1060
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:18,909
Yes, sir.

1061
01:34:19,034 --> 01:34:21,870
David Childers is in to kick
for Joshua Webster.

1062
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:25,791
This is his first season.
He's gone three for four this season.

1063
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:28,752
<i>He's been limited to short-range kicks.</i>

1064
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:31,672
Come on, David. You got this.

1065
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:51,859
Yeah.

1066
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:59,867
Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout.

1067
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:04,997
Coach, I'm done.
Someone else has gotta lead.

1068
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:08,125
Brock, this is when it matters most.
I know you're tired.

1069
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:12,212
It's easy to lead when you're strong.
But now is when you lead us, right now.

1070
01:35:12,337 --> 01:35:15,883
Can you give me four more downs?
I just need four more downs.

1071
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,218
Four more.

1072
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:19,887
All right, come here.

1073
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:23,265
This is our time and you've got to
put the nails in the coffin.

1074
01:35:23,348 --> 01:35:26,894
Look at me. We didn't fight this far
to give up in the last quarter.

1075
01:35:27,019 --> 01:35:28,645
Leave everything on the field.

1076
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:31,064
And field goals, they're not an option.

1077
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:33,734
I need you for four more downs.
Who's with me?

1078
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:35,819
Now get out there and get it done.

1079
01:35:35,944 --> 01:35:39,156
With less than two minutes left,
the Giants stand on the verge

1080
01:35:39,281 --> 01:35:41,825
of their fourth straight
consecutive state title.

1081
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:46,705
<i>A tired Eagles team</i>
<i>lines up to face 'em yet again.</i>

1082
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:51,293
Stone wall. Stone wall.

1083
01:35:51,376 --> 01:35:53,712
Yes. Stone wall.

1084
01:35:53,795 --> 01:35:55,339
- Stone wall.
- Stone wall.

1085
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:58,258
Stone wall. Stone wall.

1086
01:35:58,342 --> 01:36:00,177
<i>The Giants line up first and goal.</i>

1087
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:03,096
<i>This score will solidify</i>
<i>the state championship.</i>

1088
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,724
<i>Wait a minute. He is stopped.</i>

1089
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:09,019
<i>The Eagles are still showing</i>
<i>determination to fight this out.</i>

1090
01:36:09,144 --> 01:36:12,231
Three more downs.

1091
01:36:12,314 --> 01:36:15,025
Three more.

1092
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:19,863
You gotta hang with me. I know it's
getting tough. We gotta stop 'em here.

1093
01:36:19,988 --> 01:36:22,366
It's second down
and goal to go for the Giants.

1094
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:24,326
<i>The state title is within their grasp.</i>

1095
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:28,664
<i>Both of the stands are on their feet</i>
<i>as they get ready to run this play.</i>

1096
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:32,626
<i>Wes Porter will take it.</i>
<i>No, the Eagles have stopped him again.</i>

1097
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:35,462
That's my team. That's my team.

1098
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:40,717
Come on. Get it in the end zone.

1099
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:42,594
Two more.

1100
01:36:42,678 --> 01:36:45,264
<i>And here we go again.</i>
<i>They're gonna try it again.</i>

1101
01:36:45,347 --> 01:36:49,685
<i>Wes Porter will take the snap.</i>
<i>He's looking to pass into the corner.</i>

1102
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:53,939
<i>But the Eagles bat down the pass.</i>
<i>The crowd is going nuts right now.</i>

1103
01:36:54,022 --> 01:36:57,442
<i>The Giants have been kept out</i>
<i>of the end zone on three straight plays.</i>

1104
01:36:57,526 --> 01:37:00,153
Now Bobby Lee Duke
will have a big decision to make.

1105
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:04,700
- We have gotta go for a field goal.
- We are not going for a field goal.

1106
01:37:06,451 --> 01:37:11,832
He's not taking it. Brock.
Brock, one more down. One more down.

1107
01:37:13,083 --> 01:37:15,961
<i>Fourth down and the Giants</i>
<i>are going for the touchdown.</i>

1108
01:37:16,044 --> 01:37:18,714
This crowd is going
absolutely berserk right now.

1109
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:22,301
<i>They line up at the one-yard line.</i>
<i>Wes Porter's gonna take the snap.</i>

1110
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:26,722
<i>Brock Kelley's gonna meet him head-on...</i>
<i>And there's a fumble.</i>

1111
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:32,853
<i>The Eagles have the football.</i>
<i>He's at the 40. He's at the 50.</i>

1112
01:37:32,936 --> 01:37:37,482
He's at the 40. He'll be run out at the
34-yard line. Are you believing this?

1113
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:41,570
With two seconds left, the Eagles
have got a shot at this football game.

1114
01:37:47,576 --> 01:37:50,996
- We've got time for a Hail Mary.
- The defense is too strong.

1115
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:53,749
We can't run it. That's our only option.

1116
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:57,753
You gotta kick it, man.

1117
01:37:57,878 --> 01:38:00,839
David. I need a 51-yard field goal.

1118
01:38:00,923 --> 01:38:04,384
- Coach, I can't kick that far.
- They've stopped the pass all night.

1119
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:07,638
- You're my best option.
- The furthest I've kicked is 39 yards.

1120
01:38:07,763 --> 01:38:10,015
There is no way
I can kick a 51-yard field goal.

1121
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:13,227
I believe you can. Do the best you can.
Leave the results to God.

1122
01:38:13,352 --> 01:38:14,770
I need you on that field.

1123
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:16,772
Field-goal unit.

1124
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:20,567
We've gotta throw it.
He can't kick it. It's too far.

1125
01:38:20,651 --> 01:38:23,445
- No, it's not.
- What are you doing?

1126
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:26,114
I'm preparing for rain.

1127
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,700
I don't understand,
but with two seconds left,

1128
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:33,247
the Eagles are putting the game in
the hands of a 145-pound backup kicker.

1129
01:38:33,330 --> 01:38:36,750
<i>This is not a good move.</i>
<i>He even has to kick into the wind.</i>

1130
01:38:40,295 --> 01:38:41,964
David.

1131
01:38:42,047 --> 01:38:44,258
David.

1132
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,761
He's not ready.
He don't think he can do it.

1133
01:38:47,886 --> 01:38:51,807
I don't have any more timeouts.
Call a timeout, Bobby Lee.

1134
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:55,018
- This kid can't kick that far.
- Call that timeout.

1135
01:38:55,143 --> 01:38:58,063
Call a timeout anyway
and let's ice him.

1136
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:07,781
David, come here. You're telling
yourself you're gonna miss this kick.

1137
01:39:07,865 --> 01:39:09,491
Coach, it's too far.

1138
01:39:09,616 --> 01:39:13,495
Listen to me. Do you think
God could help you make this kick?

1139
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:16,081
- Do you believe it, David?
- Yeah, if he wants to.

1140
01:39:16,164 --> 01:39:19,001
So do I. Give me your best
and leave the rest up to him.

1141
01:39:19,084 --> 01:39:21,253
Will you do that for me?

1142
01:39:29,887 --> 01:39:32,264
Make this field goal or not,
we'll praise him.

1143
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:36,935
But don't you walk off this field
having done any less than your best.

1144
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,832
- Can I help you?
- Don't touch me.

1145
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:01,710
I'm standing for my son.

1146
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:06,048
God, help me make this kick.

1147
01:40:11,762 --> 01:40:14,515
Take it now. Take it now.

1148
01:40:14,598 --> 01:40:16,391
Hit.

1149
01:40:23,982 --> 01:40:28,153
<i>The kick is up. It's on its way.</i>
<i>It's long enough. It's high enough.</i>

1150
01:40:28,237 --> 01:40:30,906
<i>It's good. It's good. It's good.</i>

1151
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:34,326
- <i>The Eagles have won the championship.</i>
- Thank you, God.

1152
01:40:34,409 --> 01:40:38,288
<i>I can't believe what I've just seen.</i>
<i>I cannot believe what I've just seen.</i>

1153
01:40:38,413 --> 01:40:40,374
A miracle has occurred here.

1154
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:45,128
<i>The Shiloh Eagles have defeated</i>
<i>the Richland Giants 24 to 23</i>

1155
01:40:45,254 --> 01:40:47,881
to take the state title
for the first time.

1156
01:40:47,965 --> 01:40:51,009
It's incredible.
It's absolutely unbelievable.

1157
01:40:52,928 --> 01:40:56,181
You are state champion.
You are state champion.

1158
01:41:25,794 --> 01:41:29,256
All right. You guys,
who's the state champions?

1159
01:41:37,014 --> 01:41:38,974
OK. OK.

1160
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:43,312
I got something to say. David Childers.

1161
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,486
Don't you ever let anyone tell you
that you're under par,

1162
01:41:51,612 --> 01:41:53,947
second-rate or inferior.

1163
01:41:55,782 --> 01:41:58,744
I just watched God
do a miracle through you.

1164
01:41:58,827 --> 01:42:01,872
I saw a field of Giants,
85 of 'em to be exact,

1165
01:42:01,997 --> 01:42:04,249
fall in defeat.

1166
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:06,668
Now you tell me
what's impossible with God.

1167
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:08,712
Nothing, Coach.

1168
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:15,177
Zach, I just watched you and the offense
do what they said could not be done.

1169
01:42:15,302 --> 01:42:19,431
- Tell me what's impossible with God.
- Nothing, Coach.

1170
01:42:19,515 --> 01:42:24,645
Brock, how about it?
You built that stone wall and it stood.

1171
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:28,524
- Tell me what's impossible with God.
- Nothing, Coach.

1172
01:42:28,607 --> 01:42:31,276
- Scott, what's impossible with God?
- Nothing.

1173
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,197
Are you sure? Those Giants are big.
They outnumber us three to one.

1174
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,533
Sure there's nothing impossible
with God?

1175
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:39,451
I'm sure, Coach.

1176
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:42,913
- Nathan, what's impossible with God?
- Nothing, Coach.

1177
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:45,707
- Jonathan?
- Nothing.

1178
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,252
- Are you positive?
- Positive, Coach.

1179
01:42:48,377 --> 01:42:51,880
So am I. So am I.

1180
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:55,050
God can do whatever he wants to do,
however he wants to do it.

1181
01:42:55,175 --> 01:42:58,887
And he chooses to work in our lives
'cause he loves us, 'cause he's good.

1182
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:04,726
Hope today's a milestone for what
he can do for the rest of your life,

1183
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:07,354
if you trust him.

1184
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:11,024
Let's spend some time thanking him.

1185
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:30,294
Look who just walked in this house.

1186
01:43:30,419 --> 01:43:34,089
Couldn't be the state champion coach
Grant Taylor, could it?

1187
01:43:34,214 --> 01:43:36,717
'Cause he's not supposed to live here.

1188
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,387
He's supposed to be out
looking for a job.

1189
01:43:40,512 --> 01:43:44,099
God did it, Brooke.

1190
01:43:44,224 --> 01:43:46,059
He did it.

1191
01:43:48,896 --> 01:43:52,649
He gave me this job,

1192
01:43:52,774 --> 01:43:55,444
provided for our needs,

1193
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:58,989
took away my fear.

1194
01:43:59,114 --> 01:44:02,284
He throws in the state championship
just 'cause he can.

1195
01:44:08,207 --> 01:44:11,543
It's been one of the best days
of my life.

1196
01:44:11,627 --> 01:44:15,714
- The day's not over yet.
- What do you mean?

1197
01:44:17,007 --> 01:44:22,596
Grant Taylor, I just want you to know
that you've made the team.

1198
01:44:23,722 --> 01:44:25,682
What team?

1199
01:44:28,143 --> 01:44:30,979
The daddy team.

1200
01:44:33,649 --> 01:44:35,776
We're gonna have a baby?

1201
01:44:35,859 --> 01:44:38,153
We're gonna have a baby.

1202
01:44:45,994 --> 01:44:48,622
You tell me, Coach Taylor,

1203
01:44:48,705 --> 01:44:53,544
tell me what's impossible
when God's on your side?

1204
01:44:56,255 --> 01:44:59,925
Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm overwhelmed.
