1
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,709
<i>Declaration of Christmas Peace is an</i>
<i>essential part of Finnish Christmas.</i>

2
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,069
<i>The first Declaration of Christmas</i>
<i>Peace was issued in 1320...</i>

3
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,031
It's really stupid and childish
of you to hide in the kitchen -

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,839
when I want to talk to you.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,078
Hiding in the kitchen won't help.

6
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,677
If you have something to tell me,
you'd better tell it right now.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,958
You're mad, paranoid mad. - There
is no such thing as paranoid mad.

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,157
It's paranoiac. And no, I'm not.

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,880
You invited your
Russian friends over? - Yes, yes.

10
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,634
Yes, yes, yes.

11
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,277
It didn't occur to you
that this is a Finnish Christmas?

12
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,035
This is not some Russian
Father Frost disco, damn it!

13
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,115
In Finland, we celebrate Christmas
with family. - I have no family here!

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,034
Whose baby is it then?
Tell me whose it is.

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,794
You're not going to say anything.
You just stare at me.

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,996
I could tell
by looking into your eyes.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,516
I could tell already back then.

18
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,229
You're just poisoning yourself.
And me.

19
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,953
Fine. We'll drink vodka then.

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,431
At least put the ham on the table.
- It's in the fridge.

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,039
It has to be served warm. Fuck!

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,636
It's frozen, damn it!

23
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,432
The ham has to be roasted the night
before. It's the Finnish way!

24
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,918
It'll take at least five hours
before it's done.

25
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,949
Were you going to serve ham
with some whipped cream for dessert?

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,396
Put the ham in the oven; it won't
roast by itself in the sink.

27
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,952
Please, put the ham in the oven.

28
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,671
Thank you.

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,789
No use protesting.
This was your fault.

30
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,674
If I give you a task,
you have to perform it.

31
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,195
That's how we do it in Finland.

32
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,636
Now close the door
and switch the oven on.

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,394
Don't slam it!

34
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,438
Did you hurt yourself?

35
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,557
It's the water thing! Get up, okay.

36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,391
Sit down.

37
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,711
Yeah, it's the baby's water.

38
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,832
We have to go right away.
I'll get your coat.

39
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,314
Put your coat on. Shit!
Let's go. The ham will be okay.

40
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,756
<i>Hello.</i>

41
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,114
Hi, it's Dad.

42
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,636
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

43
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,437
I just got back from Paris. Where
can we meet? - I'm in the hospital.

44
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,030
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>- I'm fine, but Mom isn't.</i>

45
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,030
What is it again?
- Come here if you want to know.

46
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,711
We have to go to Grandpa's grave and
visit Grandma in the nursing home.

47
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,556
You've never done anything for me,
so I don't care if you come or not.

48
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,953
Which hospital are you at?
- At the women's clinic.

49
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,151
I'm right next door.
I'll be there in a minute.

50
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,191
Damn it.

51
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,595
Shit, this is the North Pole.

52
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,349
Hold it back.

53
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,197
Press your chin to your chest.
- Good.

54
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,272
Push! It's coming.

55
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,628
Darling, please tell me. I can't
go on living if you don't tell me.

56
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,837
One more push.
- Push once more.

57
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,070
It's coming.

58
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,073
Was it Erkki? Tell me if it was him.

59
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,714
Tell me. Was it Erkki?
- Yes!

60
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,395
Get out! - I could tell it right
away. I could see it in your eyes.

61
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,071
At least tell me if it's
a boy or a girl. - It's a girl.

62
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,868
Out!
- I could tell right away.

63
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,031
Hi.

64
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,953
Tero. What's the situation?

65
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,599
Mom is dead.

66
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,397
You killed her.

67
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,150
Juha, hurry. There is a fight.
- I'll kill you.

68
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,791
Stop!

69
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,352
You'll have to live with it now!

70
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,392
You'll pay for it.

71
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,354
Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.

72
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,990
Everything's okay.

73
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,872
Are you sure?
- Yes.

74
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,189
Is... Riitta Parviainen
somewhere here?

75
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,352
I'm Rauno Vajanne.

76
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,076
Follow me.

77
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,032
<i>Hello.</i>

78
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,034
It's Santa Claus.
<i>- Okay, I'll open it.</i>

79
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,835
Okay, Justus, go and see who it is.

80
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,392
Who is it?
- Good evening!

81
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,275
Please, come in.

82
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,549
Merry Christmas. It does, indeed,
look very Christmassy here.

83
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,672
Look at this big box, Justus.

84
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,389
I think it's for your mother.
- No, it's not.

85
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,753
So I shouldn't give it to her?
- No, because it's not for her.

86
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,838
But it says M...

87
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,198
No, it says J, U, S, T.
You're right. It's for Justus.

88
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,115
Santa's eyes are bad,
and Santa is tired.

89
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,948
Santa has a long night ahead of him.

90
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,191
Come and give Santa a hug before
you start opening the presents.

91
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,235
Merry Christmas, Justus.
Santa gives you a big hug.

92
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,556
Merry Christmas, dear child.
- Santa must be in a hurry.

93
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,954
No, I'm not in that big of a hurry.

94
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,195
Why don't we open this one.
It must be for you.

95
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,232
I'm sure Santa has a lot of children
to visit tonight. - Well, yes...

96
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,590
Justus, Merry Christmas.

97
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,474
Okay, time for Santa to go.
- Already?

98
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,279
Mom will see Santa off.

99
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,319
Erkki, you can't do something like
this. I can't take it anymore.

100
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,519
I'm sorry. I just had to see him.

101
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,909
Take good care of him.

102
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,074
Tell him that I loved him.
That I always loved him. Promise?

103
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,511
Of course.

104
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,317
I'm sorry about all this.
- So am I.

105
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,114
Well, that's how our life went.

106
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,832
Yeah, that's right.

107
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,077
<i>Dear Justus -

108
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,552
<i>I decided to write to you because</i>
<i>my illness has been getting worse.</i>

109
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,553
<i>I am afraid</i>
<i>I will not see you again.</i>

110
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,395
<i>Even though I have not been</i>
<i>the father I had hoped to be -

111
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,836
<i>I want you to know</i>

112
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,596
<i>I hope you will understand</i>
<i>my decision, whatever it will be.</i>

113
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,276
Hi. - Hi.

114
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,639
I just had the baby. Imagine
becoming a father at this age.

115
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,278
Let's go and have a drink.
- Congratulations.

116
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,230
It's kind of a bad moment. I was in
the middle of something important.

117
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,709
C'mon, don't be such a bore.

118
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,429
You are born only once.
But you die a bit more often.

119
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,993
We'll die, that's for sure.

120
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,194
I wanted to have a drink with you.

121
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,389
Okay.

122
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,192
See you there. Bye.

123
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,919
Rauno, damn it.

124
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,718
What are you doing here?
- Hi!

125
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,396
I slipped and had my knee checked.
But everything is okay. - Good.

126
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,472
What's up with you?
- I just had a baby.

127
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,839
Today, on Christmas Eve?
- Yes. At this age.

128
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,152
Congratulations! That's incredible.

129
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,433
Life is full of surprises.

130
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,717
Can I buy you a drink somewhere?

131
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,989
Thanks, but I am not sure if I have
time. I have to meet someone.

132
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,110
Actually, I'm going to see Erkki.

133
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,874
Oh. I would get to see him too.

134
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,398
So you don't have
any Christmas plans then?

135
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,033
I'll give my Christmas gift
to Tero tomorrow.

136
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,316
I'm free to do anything today.

137
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,115
What the heck. We're both Christmas
widows. - If it's okay with you.

138
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,749
Of course. I'm just a bit puzzled
to see you here.

139
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,118
This is incredible.
- Let's go then, if you have time.

140
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,596
I have to drive my car home first.

141
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,749
We'll grab a bite, too...

142
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,678
Enter into the joy.
- Quite a mansion. This is nice.

143
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,756
This is okay, nothing special.
- Nice and cozy.

144
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,397
Feel free to look around.

145
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,832
You must be hungry.
- It smells really good.

146
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,718
There is gravy on the floor.
- What?

147
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,029
Yes, it's gravy, indeed.
It's my wife's water.

148
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,029
What?
- I'll clean it up later.

149
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,792
We'll close at six tonight.
Will there be anything else?

150
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,359
One more, please.

151
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,711
Hi.

152
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,798
Hi! And congratulations!

153
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,070
I can't believe this.
- I brought my girlfriend with me.

154
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,994
It's great to see you. It's been
a long time. - Great to see you.

155
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,918
We haven't met since your bachelor
party. - Let's not talk about it.

156
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,519
Can I get you something? We're
closing. - We'll all have vodka.

157
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,394
I'll have a beer as well.
- I'd like French red wine.

158
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,949
So, which one is it?
- A girl Jesus.

159
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,111
And everything is okay? - Yes.

160
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,273
How much does she weigh?
- The same as the ham.

161
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,950
I don't know her weight. Like all
babies, she's small and wrinkly.

162
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,319
Does she look like her father or
mother? - Like her mother, I hope.

163
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,836
How is your wife?
- She is fine.

164
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,790
I'm sure. Her life
revolves around the baby now.

165
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,519
It's been some time we last met.
- It's been almost a year.

166
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,278
Let's toast to a new life!

167
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,671
Congratulations, Matti!
- Thanks.

168
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,952
What could be more beautiful
than having a baby on Christmas Eve?

169
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,639
And it's incredible we met. - We
ran into each other at the hospital.

170
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,669
So you have been living abroad.
- Yes.

171
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,436
What brings you here?
- I have family obligations.

172
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,036
So you just arrived?
- Yes, I arrived today.

173
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,869
You have to see people at Christmas.

174
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,953
So, how is your son?
- He's doing alright.

175
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,671
He's been working
as an electrician in films.

176
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,994
And now he is a stagehand
at the National Theatre.

177
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,110
But he hasn't quite
found his place yet.

178
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,477
He's smart, though.

179
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,631
He's the little boy who hit me in
the balls with a badminton racket.

180
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,559
Yes, in a doubles match.

181
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,913
So, are you single?
- No. I have a French girlfriend.

182
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,993
I'm a bit of a traveling man. One
day I'm here and the next I'm there.

183
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,118
I have to decide whether I'll stay
there or if I'm going to come back.

184
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,474
Why? I understood
that you have a good career there.

185
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,875
I've got a lot of interesting work
there, but I miss Finland.

186
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,592
You managed to get out of here,
so stay there. - Yes, this is no...

187
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,594
Sorry, I have to take this.
It's a work call.

188
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,197
We have to go to another bar.
- Drink up, and we'll go.

189
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,636
Are there any bars open tonight?
- We'll find a place.

190
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,074
What is it with his son? - I don't
know. I thought Rauno was gay.

191
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,910
Well... He is.

192
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,957
You never know.
But that is what I have understood.

193
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,429
Not that it matters.

194
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:15,238
I wonder if this French girlfriend
is just a cover-up. - Well...

195
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,116
But he's a great guy anyway.
- That's right.

196
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,478
It's incredible that we're here
together on a night like this.

197
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,354
We're in the same spot as 30 years
ago. We have the same freedom.

198
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,557
I don't know about you, but
I can do anything I want tonight.

199
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,952
It's beautiful how
the age of a person...

200
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,511
Look, he's still got the same
enthusiasm. - No, but I mean...

201
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,515
We are going to hear
philosophizing and praise all night.

202
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,789
I haven't had a chance to speak
Finnish in a long time. - Now you do.

203
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,308
All the different ages are in us.
- Tell me about it.

204
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,233
They're present in us all the time.

205
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,112
It's fascinating. - It's true. You
carry them with you your whole life.

206
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,509
Guess where I bumped into you
the last time? - I have no idea.

207
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,713
You won't believe this.
I was in a book shop in Paris.

208
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,795
Your photo book was there. It'd been
translated into French. - Really?

209
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,953
Didn't you know? - Of course I did,
but it was amazing you found it.

210
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,954
I though it would end up
on a shelf at the Finnish embassy.

211
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,318
For some reason, they
translated the title as L'Intimité.

212
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,153
In their plainness
and expressiveness -

213
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,438
your photos are exceptional.

214
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,394
Who was the actress you worked with
in the film that was shown here?

215
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,674
The one where the woman's son
starts to threaten your character.

216
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,314
She had dark hair.
A beautiful woman. - Nathalie.

217
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,317
She's a fantastic actress, but
the film itself was nothing special.

218
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,989
It was an art house film.
- They played it here in the spring.

219
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,436
But the woman...

220
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,390
I wanted to ask you something
after reading your book.

221
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,871
The relationship you have
with the people you photograph...

222
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,830
I had no relationships, especially
not with the girl on the cover.

223
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,953
I wish I had.
I even asked her if we could.

224
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,269
You have photographed so much
suffering and misery, and war...

225
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,955
That's the point.

226
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,472
When your work
has been based on the shock effect -

227
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,597
you want to show things
in their nakedness.

228
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,468
They're nude photographs? - No,
the people's eyes are naked in them.

229
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,918
So they're portraits? - They
portray people in their daily lives.

230
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,868
I've made one series of nude
photographs. I'll show them to you.

231
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,470
I hope the nude photos are
not of you. - No, they're not.

232
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,589
The photos are of dead
and dying people.

233
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,149
Bruised people.

234
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,234
But that's Matti's everyday life.
- Sort of.

235
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,629
I would like to spend one day
in your shoes.

236
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,792
You're working on a project
that has to do with the police? - No.

237
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,876
I'm just interested in how people in
different professions see the world.

238
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,431
Why do you bother yourself with
that? Evil is contagious, you know.

239
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,675
Why touch all that? - I'm interested
in different perspectives.

240
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,710
My perspective is illusory.
I work with fiction.

241
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,156
That's what I mean.
I work with fiction as well.

242
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,074
But you see the reality as well.
You photograph the suffering.

243
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,156
That's what I mean. Is it worth it
to touch all evil in the world?

244
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,151
Even though we are taught that
we shouldn't look at everything -

245
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,679
I think we should
choose what we want to see.

246
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,029
Why should we deliberately poison
our souls and minds? - You're right.

247
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,909
I've had enough of all that.

248
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,752
I can't stand
the smell of dead bodies anymore.

249
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:53,155
So you're saying
that you're tired of your work.

250
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,275
What pills are you taking?

251
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,639
Remember that I'm a cop. If you have
stimulants, please share with us.

252
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,670
We'll empty our pockets for you.
- Pop anything you want.

253
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,119
That makes this Christmas perfect.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Santa!

254
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,394
He seemed a bit lost.

255
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,674
Where are we going to find a bar
that's open? - And soon, I hope.

256
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,991
Matti, you know the bars.

257
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,194
Don't worry, young men.

258
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,475
We'll have hypothermia.

259
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,633
And with some more snow,
they'll never find us.

260
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,750
"Three mummies found in a park."
- You never whined about cold before.

261
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,152
Let's go and sing something.
- Let's run! Boys, let's run!

262
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,596
You can't be serious.
- Absolutely!

263
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,753
The lights are on.

264
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,355
This is a karaoke joint.
Are you sure you want to go in?

265
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,557
We're closed.

266
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,714
Sorry, but we're closed. - Please,
we've been walking all night.

267
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,595
You'll have to come back
after Christmas. - Please, wait.

268
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,830
I became a father today.
We'll drink a lot.

269
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,039
Alright then. Make sure
you drink your money's worth.

270
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,192
Merry Christmas!

271
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,955
You can sit wherever you like.
- Thanks.

272
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,512
There are not too many people here.
- We can sit anywhere we like.

273
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,195
One, two, one, two...

274
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,990
I would like to eat something.
- We'll get something.

275
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,513
You can also sing karaoke.
You can choose your own song.

276
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,109
I'll show you.

277
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,830
You can sing while you drink.
You know this one?

278
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,795
<i>Te-pe-tee, te-pe-te-pe te-pe-tee</i>
<i>Spring is in full swing</i>

279
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,915
<i>Te-pe-tee, te-pe-te-pe te-pe-tee</i>
<i>I heard a little bird singing</i>

280
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,394
Erkki, come!

281
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,598
<i>We are two birds in the same tree</i>
<i>When we sing together</i>

282
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,755
<i>Everyone will hear the call of love</i>

283
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,360
<i>Te-pe-tee, te-pe-te-pe te-pe-tee</i>
<i>I built a nest</i>

284
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,033
<i>Te-pe-tee, te-pe-te-pe te-pe-tee</i>
<i>I want to share it with my dearest</i>

285
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,588
This is a flamethrower.

286
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,278
It was worth waiting for.

287
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,277
We haven't toasted to
the new father yet, so here we go.

288
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,799
To the new father and to fatherhood.
- To all beautiful and lovely women.

289
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,317
All women are so beautiful
I could fuck them.

290
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,472
It's so surprising
to hear you say that.

291
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,438
Our Don Giovanni.

292
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,553
I've always been into
falling in love.

293
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,950
So you fall in love and... - At
the same time, I long for solitude.

294
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,159
When I'm abroad,
staying at a hotel -

295
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,753
I enjoy my freedom and
independence immensely.

296
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,189
There is no one
who will tell me what to do.

297
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,956
Then I see a person
who smiles at me -

298
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,590
and looks like she might like me.

299
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,353
And I see us living
a happy life together -

300
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,318
sharing moments and all that.

301
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,909
At night, I have these fantasies
about caring for someone.

302
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,757
I'll find a woman shivering
with cold. We're on an island.

303
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,390
The woman has been sailing
and has suffered a shipwreck.

304
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,838
I'll carry her in and heat the sauna
for her. I'll take her clothes off.

305
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,390
It's erotic and protective
at the same time.

306
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,348
The women must be in seventh heaven.

307
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,795
But I've never found
a woman on an island.

308
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,274
So what seems to be love is really
just a fleeting moment of passion.

309
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,069
It is an erotic fantasy -

310
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,268
as it always ends in love-making.
- You mean fucking.

311
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,317
But there is tenderness
and giving pleasure.

312
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,998
Do you give pleasure to the woman
or yourself? - To the woman.

313
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,712
It's part of male eroticism. Like
Alberoni says, a man is by the...

314
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,234
Sorry to interrupt,
but do you see a connection -

315
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,111
between the way
you act with women and your morals?

316
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,910
You said earlier
that one should have morals.

317
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,392
Or do you just act on your instinct?
- I act on my instinct.

318
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:51,430
So you're an animal. - Yes. What
is the world crying out for? Animal!

319
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,154
It cries out for something more.
- We should free the animal in us.

320
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,472
I wish I had understood earlier -

321
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,349
that instead of
focusing on yourself -

322
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,672
you could delve into
the other person.

323
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,472
I have never taken responsibility
for anything.

324
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,839
I always left
when I should have made a decision.

325
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,874
Do you feel a longing
for something you have lost?

326
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,396
I don't know.

327
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,189
I have always enjoyed long flights.

328
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,750
I often become emotional.

329
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,514
I feel like crying about my life
and the people I have lost.

330
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:53,793
I want to cry about the happiness
I have had in my life.

331
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,509
It's a happy cry.

332
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,276
What are you crying about?
Do you miss your children?

333
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,319
I have tried to learn to be selfish.

334
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,153
I have tried to tell myself -

335
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,029
that my children
are not an extension of my life.

336
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,394
They have their own lives. I don't
want them to be defined by me.

337
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,998
Of course I offer them security.
But I've been away from home a lot.

338
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,188
I have been reckless,
and I have felt guilty about it.

339
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,511
Especially after my divorce,
I worried about them.

340
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,070
How would they do
when I wasn't there -

341
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,028
to provide them with security.

342
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,116
But I've tried to learn selfishness.
- Why do you want to be selfish?

343
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,357
Would you do it for your children or
because it makes your work easier?

344
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,710
I believe
that if I can fulfill myself -

345
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,916
and become myself,
so to speak -

346
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,232
I will be a better person
with other people and my children.

347
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,793
You say you will be a better person
if you become whole and yourself.

348
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,758
How will it help your children -

349
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,753
if you're whole
on the other side of the world?

350
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,597
Sorry for being provocative. - It's
as if you are talking about my life.

351
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,197
My situation is different.
I haven't had children before today.

352
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,838
It has been
the biggest tragedy of my life.

353
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,148
That is why my first marriage
ended the way it did.

354
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,839
I'm happy that it ended because
it was really difficult in the end.

355
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,239
Are you crying? - It's just that it's
like you're talking about my life.

356
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,070
It's just that... I'm so fucking...

357
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:03,677
I talk about humanity
and about being a better person.

358
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,400
I talk about how, as an actor,
I should be a better person.

359
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,629
And the only thing
I have done in my life -

360
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,514
is leave my family.

361
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,878
Then you have to face
your nothingness.

362
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,800
The conflict is sometimes so...
- What is the big issue then?

363
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,673
I have abandoned my closest people.

364
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,192
I have escaped,
escaped and escaped...

365
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,833
Do you feel a need
to do something about it?

366
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,034
I don't know if I can. How do you
undo the past thirty years?

367
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:59,151
Do you keep in touch with your
ex-wife, the mother of your son?

368
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,193
I see her at Christmas.

369
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,029
I see her at Christmas.

370
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,468
I think you just touched
a sore spot there.

371
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,352
He was like that
when I met him in the hospital.

372
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,876
What is it?
- I don't know. He hasn't told me.

373
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,669
We should be able
to talk about things like these.

374
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:35,030
Just between us...
- Did I say something wrong again?

375
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,878
You must have touched a sore spot.
You showed the animal in you.

376
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,596
Shit, shit, shit.

377
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,312
These things are not easy.
And if you think about Rauno...

378
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,871
He's coming.
- I mean, you and your women...

379
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,110
Gypsies, wine and women! Like
Dmitri in <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

380
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,759
C'mon, let's sing something.

381
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,073
I need some signs of life, you know.
- Patron!

382
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:20,352
<i>Loneliness around me</i>
<i>Sometimes takes human form</i>

383
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,269
<i>I know what I want</i>
<i>I know how little I am capable of</i>

384
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,598
<i>Loneliness in my heart</i>
<i>Condenses into bitter drops</i>

385
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:54,191
<i>That is the cause</i>
<i>And consequence of loneliness</i>

386
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,154
<i>I'm stuck on you</i>
<i>I will always be</i>

387
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,674
<i>Say "leave"and I will go</i>

388
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,356
<i>Soon you will see</i>
<i>I didn't go anywhere</i>

389
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:28,949
<i>I wish I knew you better</i>
<i>Then I might learn to know myself</i>

390
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:38,913
<i>Even though I never left you</i>
<i>I will come again</i>

391
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:51,229
<i>I wish I knew you better</i>
<i>Then I might learn to know myself</i>

392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,759
<i>Even though I never left you</i>
<i>I will come again</i>

393
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,353
<i>I don't envy those</i>
<i>Who were born to live a double life</i>

394
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,512
<i>Sometimes I feel</i>
<i>One life is hard enough</i>

395
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:37,273
<i>I wish I knew you better</i>
<i>Through our frozen fatherland</i>

396
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:46,915
<i>Even though I never left you</i>
<i>I will come again</i>

397
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,951
Good job, Rauno!

398
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,039
Give it your all!

399
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,195
That was a great performance.
Good job! - Perfect!

400
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,592
Excellent.
- Sit down, will you.

401
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,396
Who's the next one on stage?
- We have to cool off.

402
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,751
Just get on stage.
I've got a song for you.

403
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,955
We agreed everybody would sing.
- In a minute.

404
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,192
We'll finish the cigars first.

405
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,592
I need another drink.
- Another round, please.

406
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:56,512
First sing, then drink.
- My throat feels coarse.

407
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,114
Somebody called you.
- I see.

408
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,840
It was Chérie.

409
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,831
Your darling called.

410
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,037
Did you answer?
- Yes.

411
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,594
Excuse me, I have to call...
- Don't go anywhere. Sit down.

412
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,073
Seemed like a nice person.
We said that you were on stage.

413
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,074
You didn't answer the phone?
- Yes, I did.

414
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,314
And?
- I said you were singing.

415
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,194
Your Chérie <i>is....</i>
- I have to call...

416
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,558
So this Chérie is a man.

417
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,116
Who called me?
- Chérie.

418
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,908
This is my agent's number.
- No one has an agent named Chérie.

419
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,233
What is his name? Jean-Pierre?
- No...

420
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,235
Why hide something like this
from your old friends? - Hide what?

421
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,235
Stop joking. Your boyfriend called.
- I don't have a boyfriend.

422
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,231
Who was it then?
- My agent.

423
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,791
Why does it say Chérie on that?
I won't let you wriggle out of this.

424
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,794
We'll talk about it
once and for all.

425
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,875
We're going to drink some more.
- I made it a triple.

426
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,838
The size of the glass
seems right to me. - Thank you.

427
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,319
A toast to Chérie!
- To Chérie.

428
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:44,031
You think I'm gay?
- We don't think anything.

429
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,908
So I'm gay because I'm an actor
and live in France?

430
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,990
There is nothing wrong
with being gay these days.

431
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,398
Why are you hiding
something like that?

432
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,468
Being gay must be so much easier.
- Could be.

433
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,272
Probably.
- Who knows.

434
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,836
It looks like it's Erkki's turn.

435
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,195
That's right.
- The stage is yours.

436
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,869
You didn't get offended, did you?
- It was tasteless.

437
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,237
It was completely harmless.
- Yeah, right.

438
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,278
Are you ready? Let's go.

439
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,356
<i>I can say "thank you"</i>
<i>In ten languages</i>

440
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,718
<i>I can wish a happy new year</i>

441
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,592
<i>But I can't catch</i>
<i>The early morning shining star</i>

442
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,239
Hi. It's Dad.

443
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,751
I'm at the Swengi karaoke club.

444
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,872
Please come here, so we can talk.

445
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:45,230
<i>Love died in the stream of life</i>
<i>Save me if you can</i>

446
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,519
<i>Save me</i>
<i>Save me</i>

447
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,711
<i>I could walk</i>
<i>Till the end of the world</i>

448
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,112
<i>I could come back and take a breath</i>

449
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,952
<i>But after you are gone</i>
<i>There is nothing left for me</i>

450
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:36,678
<i>I don't understand the magic of life</i>
<i>Save me if you have time</i>

451
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,795
<i>Save me</i>
<i>Save me</i>

452
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,636
<i>Save me</i>

453
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,639
That was a great performance, Erkki.
Very soulful.

454
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,238
You just told more about yourself -

455
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,153
than you have
during the whole night.

456
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,312
That's right.
You cover yourself so much.

457
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,074
With you two,
there is a good reason for it.

458
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,756
Why couldn't we have
more moments like that?

459
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,151
Why do we have to be so goddamn...

460
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,989
I told you
that the joke was tasteless.

461
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,597
Fucking tasteless.

462
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,112
Riitta just died.

463
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,189
And Tero beat me up at the hospital.

464
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,675
And you,
who I consider my friends...

465
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,829
Riitta is dead?

466
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,397
Should we follow him?

467
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,235
You have a problem?
- I hope not.

468
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,996
Everything is fine.
- Good.

469
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,192
Did you know?
- No.

470
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,150
I didn't know. I could tell
he wasn't himself when I met him.

471
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,716
Rauno the Ruin.
That's how I used to call him.

472
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,959
I was joking.
It was just a nickname.

473
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,951
In reality
Rauno was in ruins when we met.

474
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,348
Rauno the Ruin.

475
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:49,388
I was working as an on-call
mental health counselor.

476
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,313
It was a depressing job.

477
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,272
After work, at 5 a.m., I used to
have coffee at a night cafe.

478
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,872
They don't have places
like that anymore.

479
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,836
It was a place
where night and day met.

480
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,675
That's where we met.

481
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,996
Rauno was still in the party mood
after a long night.

482
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,558
I recognized Rauno
from television and films.

483
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,790
I thought I was
his last desperate attempt.

484
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,474
He walked me home and said he
would come for coffee the next day.

485
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:39,272
At the same time and place.
I was sure we would never see again.

486
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,828
The next morning Rauno sat there.
Sober.

487
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,510
I have to admit
he made an impression.

488
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,073
In a month, we were living together.
A year later, Tero was born.

489
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,229
Then everything was over.

490
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,037
I think he fell in love with me -

491
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,193
because he saw in me
a chance to change.

492
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:16,074
But when Tero was born, he didn't
have the strength to change anymore.

493
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:28,116
For a few of years, he tried to hang
onto the relationship. Then he left.

494
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,313
The divorce was
actually a relief for me -

495
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,192
but Tero is
a walking fatherlessness.

496
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,670
It hurts more than death.

497
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,717
It's normal to react that way
in a situation like this.

498
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,717
Saying that the joke was tasteless
was an excuse to tell us something.

499
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,792
Maybe it was good that he...

500
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,995
Okay, I'll leave.
- No, you won't.

501
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,074
I'm sorry about that.

502
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,869
I'm really sorry about that. - We'll
all feel bad if you leave now.

503
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,318
I will go to my lonely hotel room
and be sad.

504
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
Sit down and stop talking bullshit.

505
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,472
We don't want you to be alone
thinking about things like these.

506
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:37,397
I'm really sorry.
It's your big day and Christmas.

507
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:43,672
So much has happened in one day.
- You could have told us right away.

508
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,678
That is exactly what I mean.

509
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:54,520
If one could always tell...
what is on one's mind.

510
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,508
How did she die?

511
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,754
She committed suicide.
Took some pills.

512
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,715
You are not responsible for it.
- Yes, I am.

513
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:16,040
Riitta always had such a clear mind.

514
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,953
I don't understand how a person
like her can do something like that.

515
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,999
Tero blames me for it, and Riitta
left a note where she blames me.

516
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,798
How do you undo a thing like this?
- Give it some time.

517
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,679
When did it happen?
- Today.

518
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,391
Give yourself a couple of days
before thinking about it.

519
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,111
I have to leave for Paris tomorrow.
I don't have time to think about it.

520
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,558
I'll just try to breathe
a little bit.

521
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,598
But you know what, guys?

522
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,469
Now we'll start this evening
all over again.

523
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:09,873
We'll have drinks first.
- I'll sit here, and then you come.

524
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,392
Let's take a couple of steps back.
I wish I could rewind my life.

525
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:19,873
To avoid this happening again,
let's speak the truth from now on.

526
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,191
No... - We'll speak nothing
but the truth from now on.

527
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,750
Straight, honest talk.
- That's a great idea.

528
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,913
Things tend to build up.

529
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,917
You won't get a new round of drinks
before Matti has sung. Hurry up.

530
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,436
Here I go.

531
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,554
Sing something cheerful.
- Hurry up.

532
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,552
A happy song, please.

533
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,351
This is Matti's choice. - This is not
that happy, but it's from our youth.

534
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,876
Are you ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

535
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,315
One, two, three.

536
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:23,631
<i>Your empty bed next to me</i>
<i>Reminds me of you</i>

537
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,872
<i>You are gone</i>

538
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:36,437
<i>And I will not have you</i>
<i>Next to me again</i>

539
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,795
<i>You went into another bed</i>

540
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,031
<i>And started everything</i>
<i>All over again</i>

541
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,116
<i>Even though you knew it would hurt</i>

542
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,356
<i>And destroy all we had</i>

543
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:13,435
<i>I don't know where to go</i>
<i>I don't know how to go on living</i>

544
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,518
<i>The day is windy</i>

545
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,678
<i>The ice just won't melt</i>

546
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:05,752
<i>But one day</i>
<i>I will be on my feet again</i>

547
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:18,837
<i>If I could just try again</i>
<i>And hold my head up high</i>

548
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,909
This one was for the beautiful woman
who just walked in.

549
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,108
Thank you.
- Good job, Matti.

550
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,829
Great performance, Matti.

551
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,037
You got audience.

552
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,591
Would you like to sit with us?

553
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,554
Come and sit with us.
- We'll get you a drink.

554
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,799
Do you speak Finnish?

555
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,275
Please come and join us.
- What?

556
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:22,871
Come and sit with us. - If you like.
We'd love to have you at our table.

557
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,910
Would you like something to drink?
A glass of water? - No...

558
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,029
Red wine.

559
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,392
I'll get it.

560
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,677
Are you waiting for someone?
- Or...

561
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,953
You got married?

562
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,069
I hope this is okay. Here you are.

563
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,314
Thanks. <i>Or....</i>

564
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:08,432
Merry Christmas!
- It's nice that you came.

565
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,313
Yes... How nice... Christmas.

566
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,550
This is unbelievable. Where
did you come from? Who are you?

567
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,432
What are you doing here?
Why are you here?

568
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:34,312
Well...
- Maybe you asked too many questions.

569
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,434
How?
- Yes. I mean, how did you get here?

570
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,191
I walked. I mean...
- It's a beautiful thing you came.

571
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,079
Do you live around here?

572
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,437
Yes.
- Does your family know you are here?

573
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,872
I mean,
does somebody wonder where you are?

574
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,476
Excuse me.
- May I sit with you?

575
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,869
<i>He's just unbelievable.</i>
- Is everything alright?

576
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,831
May I take a photo of you?

577
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,753
I'm a photographer.

578
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,751
Is it okay if I take a picture?

579
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,110
They're laughing.
- They're laughing at me.

580
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:41,716
He is a professional photographer.

581
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,872
They think they're funny.

582
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,193
You have been photographed before,
haven't you?

583
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,196
Please put your hand on the table.
Yes, that's beautiful.

584
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,232
Thank you.

585
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,596
Please look that way.

586
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,395
Can I ask you one thing?
Smile, please.

587
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,117
Why don't you smile?

588
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:43,276
If you want,
I'll delete these pictures. - Well.

589
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,269
Thanks.

590
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,960
What an idiot.

591
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,751
That fucking whoremonger! Damn it!

592
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,788
What a charming woman!
- She looks really disturbed.

593
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:15,432
You think with your cock, or what?
- C'mon.

594
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,516
She could be a Russian whore.
She is crazy, that's for sure.

595
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,434
Not all Russian women are whores.
You should know.

596
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,592
What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.

597
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,078
What did you mean by that?
- I didn't mean anything.

598
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,153
When you said
she was a Russian whore...

599
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:41,348
Were you talking about my wife?
- No. I didn't mean anything.

600
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:46,475
Don't blame it on me.
You said it yourself.

601
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,191
You know this isn't that easy
for me. - C'mon. Calm down.

602
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:56,753
Why did you bring it up?
What's your motive? - That's unfair.

603
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,436
I don't understand you.
I think your behavior is outrageous.

604
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,912
Why can't I photograph this woman
if I find her beautiful?

605
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,958
C'mon.
Everyone can see what you are after.

606
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:13,352
Why are you so upset?
- I don't understand you.

607
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:19,829
It's just innocent fun. I wouldn't
exploit a woman like that.

608
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:25,479
How do you know where it will lead
to? How do you know what she wants?

609
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:31,954
How do you know you won't hurt her
or somebody else, maybe her husband?

610
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,472
If it leads to something,
I will let it happen.

611
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,799
I won't give a shit about criticism.

612
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,477
This is what I was
talking about earlier.

613
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,634
If I had given love and
looked at another human being -

614
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,628
instead of thinking about fame
and other fucking people -

615
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,793
I would have understood
other human beings better.

616
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,236
If I had loved
another human being.

617
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,518
I could love this person.
I love you, Matti.

618
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,036
You're my friend. - Don't touch me.

619
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,432
I don't understand your way of life.

620
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,636
How can you live like that?

621
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,793
That's quite a broad question. - You
talk from here and act from here.

622
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,190
How is my life any of your business?

623
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,273
Do you even know
how many children you have? - Two.

624
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,071
Are you sure?
- As sure as a man can be.

625
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:37,639
You call your fuck after nine months
and ask is she is okay? - No. No.

626
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,717
We better not say anything.

627
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,997
It's no use talking
when you are in a state like that.

628
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,551
You're not going anywhere.
Now we'll talk this over.

629
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,271
C'mon. - You always run
when you have to talk.

630
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,955
Let me go, you fucking cop.
- What?

631
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,839
A cop.
- Yes, that's my job.

632
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,435
Don't do this.

633
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,194
We're in no hurry.
- What did I say wrong?

634
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:09,918
You talk about morals,
but you have none in your life.

635
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,470
You never look back
at what you have done.

636
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,394
What kind of carcasses
have I left behind then? None.

637
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,194
You never looked back.

638
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,754
Why are you talking to me like this?
- I know something about your life.

639
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,517
We're friends, aren't we? Damn it.
- Think about it.

640
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,039
We shouldn't have to think
about that, butthead.

641
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:00,599
<i>You see children in the yard again</i>
<i>Playing games under your window</i>

642
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,470
<i>You are standing by the window</i>
<i>You can't move</i>

643
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:17,156
<i>You fly back in years</i>
<i>Every day your memories catch you</i>

644
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:23,229
<i>Who is going to sing the swan song?</i>

645
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:35,437
<i>Your eyes reflect</i>
<i>Moments from birth to death</i>

646
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:43,188
<i>They make some believe in God</i>
<i>Others in the Devil or in anything</i>

647
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,554
<i>But they do not believe</i>
<i>In this world</i>

648
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,830
<i>You once found</i>
<i>The love of the half-century</i>

649
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:11,553
<i>It was easy to be happy</i>

650
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,638
<i>What do you do with your instincts</i>

651
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,588
<i>When the birds have flown</i>
<i>Out of the nest</i>

652
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,469
<i>Old photos are</i>
<i>The only things you have</i>

653
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,792
<i>You look at them</i>
<i>Over and over again</i>

654
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:40,230
<i>You might not need my pity</i>
<i>It won't numb your pain</i>

655
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:47,829
<i>That pain is writing this song</i>
<i>That pain will catch anyone</i>

656
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,873
<i>That pain will catch anyone</i>

657
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,755
<i>You see your mourning veil</i>
<i>You lifted your veil five years ago</i>

658
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,720
<i>The swan song made you cry then</i>
<i>It made you cry</i>

659
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,435
<i>You would like to be</i>
<i>like you were then</i>

660
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,111
<i>When you wore your white veil</i>

661
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,076
Are you sick?
- Yes.

662
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,870
You're sick.
- Yeah.

663
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,799
You want me to give you a snow job?

664
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,637
Listen, boy. We promised
we would be honest with each other.

665
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,110
I want to tell you now
that I invited you here -

666
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:20,831
because I wanted to get so drunk
I could kill you.

667
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,232
I'm fucking going to kill you.
And you know why.

668
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,475
You know exactly
why I'm going to kill you.

669
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,476
What are you talking about?
- You fucking two-timer.

670
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,712
What?
- What have you done to my life?

671
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,190
What are you talking about?
- "What are you talking about?"

672
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:44,911
Do I have to fucking draw
a picture for you?

673
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,193
What's the matter?
- Do you remember last spring?

674
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,232
Put that away. - No, I won't.
Listen to me carefully.

675
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,756
Remember last spring when
we were at my summerhouse? - Yes.

676
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,833
Remember that I went to bed,
by myself?

677
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,468
After that, my wife got pregnant.

678
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,393
Do I have to count
the months for you?

679
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,878
The thought
hasn't even crossed you mind!

680
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,518
It's not true. - You want to ask
my wife? She told me today.

681
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,912
I could tell right away.
I knew it the next day.

682
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,236
I don't believe you. - You don't?
Do you want to go see the baby?

683
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,995
One thing is certain.
You will never see the baby.

684
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:40,513
I wouldn't kill you because you've
done something you shouldn't have.

685
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:45,197
I don't want you to come between
me and my child. She's my child.

686
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,273
I've dreamed of a family
all my life.

687
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,556
I will not let you ruin it.

688
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:58,598
You understand?
Tell me that you do. - I do.

689
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,237
Good. - I do.

690
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,674
That was my Christmas message.

691
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:13,518
Go ahead. I was going to do
the same anyway. - What's this?

692
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,953
You know what it is.
- To hell with it.

693
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,877
What's wrong with you?

694
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,356
What is it?

695
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,069
I have received radiotherapy
since spring.

696
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,836
Now it has been discontinued.
I am getting symptomatic treatment.

697
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,549
The radiotherapy
has been discontinued.

698
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,389
I'm dying.

699
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:54,508
Fuck... - I told you I was ill.
And now I am this far.

700
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,831
I'm sorry.

701
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,678
I'm sorry.
- You're my friend. I'm really sorry.

702
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:13,915
You have always been my friend.
I have admired your achievements.

703
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,073
I have envied you because
you always got all the girls.

704
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:27,232
But now I'm dying. I'm dying.

705
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,989
I got it.

706
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,352
I wouldn't have killed you.
- How could you have killed me?

707
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,553
You'd have been in deep shit and
your child wouldn't have had a...

708
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:48,919
You said it's your child and
that nobody could come between you.

709
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,349
Nobody will.
Take care of your child.

710
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,835
I will.

711
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,593
I didn't know
you had reached that point.

712
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,434
<i>... Others in the Devil</i>
<i>Or in anything...</i>

713
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,433
I think you just found
a new soulmate.

714
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,235
It's winter.

715
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,752
She needs someone to protect her.

716
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,715
You'll never learn.

717
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,875
I think you'll have a woman
at your deathbed caressing you.

718
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,600
I'll do my best to guarantee that.

719
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,475
Maybe we'll die tonight.
- Not tonight.

720
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,473
And you'll have a woman
by your side.

721
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,031
Yes, I have a woman.
- That's beautiful, too.

722
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,557
You are cold. You should go inside.

723
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:15,709
Let's not talk about this to anyone.

724
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,033
This will remain between you and me.

725
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,352
I'll go in. See you there.

726
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,759
How does the song end?
- I don't know. Ask him.

727
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,715
Oh, dear, how does the song end?

728
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,030
I'm going to be a father.

729
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,198
That's great.

730
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,037
Yeah, I know.

731
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,112
That's really great.
- It's great.

732
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,074
No more cigars.

733
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,515
That's great.

734
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:46,116
Matti, I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

735
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,752
Oh, it's you.

736
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,276
I thought...
- No...

737
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,071
I'm sorry.
- For what?

738
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:07,553
I'm behaving a bit... I haven't
drunk anything in two years.

739
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,913
How do you feel?
- At the moment I feel good.

740
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,795
I stopped taking
my medication today.

741
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:28,957
Really? I stopped taking mine.
Today. - Today?

742
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,869
Yes. What meds were you taking?

743
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,754
Certral. You know it?
- Yes.

744
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,316
For depression.

745
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:47,076
It was that bad? How long did you
take them? Where were you?

746
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,151
I ran away so that I could live
without the meds.

747
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:01,871
How are you feeling?
- Now? A bit strange.

748
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,435
Do you remember <i>Papillon,</i> the film?

749
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,036
A young prisoner comes in,
and an old prisoner asks him, -

750
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,919
"How do I look?"

751
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,233
The young one says,
"You look damn good."

752
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:21,151
I can say the same to you. How do I
look? By the way, what is your name?

753
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,431
Magdalena.
- How do I look?

754
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,750
You look fine.
- Thanks.

755
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:40,036
Why did you take photos of me?
- I am a photographer. Really.

756
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,436
This camera is a bit small.

757
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,632
I'm a photographer -

758
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:53,517
but I'm tired of carrying
all the equipment with me.

759
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,951
Take a photo of me.

760
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:59,157
I mean...

761
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,552
If there will be no tomorrow, I want
you to photograph me the way I am.

762
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,514
This is me.

763
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,715
You are beautiful.

764
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,036
I don't know
if these are going to be any good.

765
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,032
The medicine has ruined my eyes.

766
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,712
I can't see either.
- Why not?

767
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,719
I mean I can see.

768
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,353
But I only see... fire.

769
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,117
Fire?
- Fire.

770
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,151
Have you...

771
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,076
Have you ever...

772
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,310
Have you ever accidentally
killed your family?

773
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,234
What happened?

774
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,235
I was supposed to
put out the candle -

775
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,429
but I fell asleep.

776
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,955
They were sleeping.

777
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:28,592
I promised, but I forgot.

778
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,958
I can't see anything else.

779
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,675
Such a small baby.

780
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,670
You have to stay here.
You have to keep on living.

781
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,672
There are so many
beautiful things in life.

782
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,789
There are so many things
worth living for.

783
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,069
Why didn't you want to live anymore?

784
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:26,198
I have incurable cancer,
and I had decided to leave today.

785
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:32,151
I don't want my closest people
to see me swollen and bleeding.

786
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,238
Stay a little longer.
Don't go just yet.

787
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:46,357
We could suffer together, maybe.

788
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,155
Or I don't know...

789
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,239
Oh, <i>you....</i>
- I have to put my coat on.

790
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,669
The Three Wise Men;
Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar -

791
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,192
Baby Jesus, Magdalene and...

792
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,590
Ho, ho, ho!

793
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:29,039
Oh, my, if it isn't...

794
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,317
Who's been naughty; who's been nice?

795
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,155
We were a bit bad,
but now we're nice.

796
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:40,598
What about you?
- I've been exceptionally nice.

797
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:48,116
You've been having a porn Christmas.
- What?

798
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:54,795
What about you, Santa?
- I've been damn nice. Hold my cane.

799
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,314
That's it. - Through the nose
is the way Santa drinks.

800
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,315
Don't drink it all...
- Drink up!

801
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,918
May I sing?
- Yes, you have to.

802
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,751
Sing us a Christmas song.
- Merry Christmas!

803
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,752
<i>Who did what in the sauna? What?</i>

804

810
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,669

811

Merry Christmas, everyone!

814
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,675
<i>Who made noise in the sauna? What?</i>

815
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,511
<i>I think it was Erkki</i>
<i>Who screamed so bad</i>

816
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,911
<i>Who made noise in the sauna? What?</i>

817
