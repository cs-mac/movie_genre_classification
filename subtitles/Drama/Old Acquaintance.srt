1
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,556
- Afternoon, Mrs. Abbott.
- How do you do?

2
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:25,832
- Hiya, Preston.
- Hello, Charlie.

3
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:28,234
Say, these things really travel, don't they?
You need any help?

4
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:29,737
- Thanks.
- How's the building business?

5
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:32,240
- Fine, if I ever get back to it.
- Here, don't forget this.

6
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,038
Say, my paper wants to get
a photograph of Katherine Marlowe...

7
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,102
- and I was told Millie might have one.
- Dozens of them.

8
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,772
- They're old friends, I hear.
- Millie says so.

9
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,543
And I understand she gonna stay
with you folks.

10
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:42,642
- You're telling me?
- And they say she's something.

11
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,314
There's a big story in the paper about it,
and every seat in Town Hall has been sold.

12
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:47,720
Everybody's talking about it.

13
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,816
Now, for goodness sakes, Kit,
don't miss the train.

14
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,326
Remember, you're a celebrity.

15
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,192
- Is that Miss Marlowe?
- Oh, Kit, it's going to be wonderful...

16
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,095
seeing you again.
I'm having a big party for you.

17
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,066
- What train is she taking?
- What train are you taking?

18
00:01:58,134 --> 00:01:59,294
- The 11:05.
- 11:05.

19
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,167
Everybody's coming. And darling,
do you realize how long it's been?

20
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,330
It's been years.

21
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:06,773
And, oh, Kit, I've something wonderful
to tell you, about me.

22
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,435
Just a moment, darling.
What is it, Charlie?

23
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,103
If that's Miss Marlowe, I wanna talk to her.

24
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,444
Kit, there's a reporter here
from <i>The Daily Journal...</i>

25
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,710
who wants to speak to you.
Just a moment.

26
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:17,981
Hello, Miss Marlowe.
What about your next book? Any news?

27
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,885
Anything special you'd like to have us say?

28
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,319
$1.50 a minute? Oh, it's long distance.

29
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,329
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me,
I didn't know. Goodbye.

30
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,766
Wait. Kit, what I wanted to tell you was,
I'm going to have a baby.

31
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:35,169
Kit. Hello? Hello? Kit.

32
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:36,769
Oh, she's hung up.

33
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,234
- Charlie.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,538
Say, how about a picture of her, Millie?
Can you spare one?

35
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,373
Oh, of course. I've lots of them.

36
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,380
I knew you'd want it,
so I got it all picked out.

37
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:47,643
- Well, haven't you got one of her alone?
- I don't think so.

38
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:48,775
What about this...

39
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:50,945
Well, I looked all through,
but I couldn't find a single one.

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,818
You see, all through school and afterward,
until she moved to New York...

41
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,755
we were absolutely inseparable.

42
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:59,886
From the first day we met,
our lives, our thoughts, our feelings were...

43
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,362
- Inseparable.
- That's it.

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,661
- The book's dedicated to me, you know?
- Yeah, I know.

45
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,633
Well, thanks, Millie.
I'll cook up a real story.

46
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,999
- Fine.
- Where do you want these, Millie?

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,766
Just a moment, dear. Will you be at
the station in the morning, Charlie?

48
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,033
- Oh, sure.
- Don't forget, the 5:11.

49
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,870
- No, 11:05.
- Oh, yes.

50
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:34,523
Oh, I hope she didn't miss the train.

51
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:37,088
- Why should she miss it?
- You don't know Kit Marlowe.

52
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,833
There you are, sir.

53
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:45,340
She did miss it. Oh, Charlie, what'll I do?
I could kill her.

54
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,707
Well, let's have a look. You take this coach
and I'll take that one. Come on, Frank.

55
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,406
- All aboard!
- I knew this would happen.

56
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:54,847
Excuse me.

57
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,411
Kit!

58
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,618
- Kit! Kit! You're here.
- Oh, are we?

59
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,281
Well, come on.

60
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,992
- Oh, Kit, how like you.
- We're leaving!

61
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,428
It's a good thing I came in here.

62
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,092
You'd have slept right through
your own hometown.

63
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,002
- Home.
- Oh, Kit.

64
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,470
Hello, Millie.

65
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,213
- Well.
- Well.

66
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,113
- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- That's all there is.

67
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,880
Toothbrush, pajamas and a clean pair of...

68
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,422
Oh, hello, Charlie. This is Charlie Archer.
He's on the paper.

69
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:35,821
- He came down to meet you.
- Oh, has he? How very nice.

70
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:37,655
Remember me? $1.50 a minute?

71
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:39,718
- Long distance?
- Of course.

72
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:41,957
We'd like to get a picture, Miss Marlowe.
Do you mind?

73
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,124
- Not at all.
- Not from the back, Frank. That's Frank.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,191
- Hello, Frank.
- Come on, jump right up here on this cart.

75
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:48,396
- Oh, not that, Charlie.
- Why not? She's gonna look swell.

76
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:51,167
Now, just kind of lean on that box there.
Get the Brownie ready, Frank.

77
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,141
Now, give a smile for the folks. That's it.

78
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,803
Hold it.

79
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,370
Hey! Where you going with that?
Wait a minute. Hold it!

80
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,818
- There she is!
- There she is, girls!

81
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,788
Excuse me, lady.
Are you Katherine Marlowe?

82
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:08,915
- Yes.
- I'm Margaret Kemp.

83
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:10,084
How do you do?

84
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,389
We represent a newly formed
Katherine Marlowe Club at the college.

85
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,657
You know, your book
has caused something of a stir among us.

86
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,790
- Oh, has it?
- Oh, it certainly has.

87
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,494
Now, we're gonna have a debate today
for an hour, after your lecture.

88
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,662
- You've got to be there to defend it.
- Defend what?

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,831
Well, never mind.
We'll tell her all about it at lunch.

90
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,567
- Yes, but...
- But you can't. Luncheon's at my home.

91
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,303
- Don't be silly, lady.
- Oh! Don't you do that!

92
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,377
Put her down! Kit! Kit!

93
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,951
You can't do this. Get down from there.
You're my guest.

94
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,856
Millie, join the Katherine Marlowe Club.

95
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,361
- Did you do this?
- No, but I got a good story.

96
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,656
- Did you get her?
- I got her.

97
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,495
- No, I mean Miss Marlowe.
- Kit! Kit, you come right back here!

98
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,398
- Bye!
- I can't!

99
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,560
- What? Oh, how do you keep your job?
- Oh, get off my car! Get away from me!

100
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:59,267
- Why don't you go back to school?
- I ain't got a shot... I only got a shot...

101
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:07,144
- Oh! My chickens! This is the milk!
- What do you mean? It's all your fault.

102
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:09,446
What's the matter with you?
You ought to be driving a wheelbarrow...

103
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,044
- that's what you ought to do!
- I'll call the police and have you arrested!

104
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,816
Get your filthy finger out of my face!

105
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,689
Don't let us down on that debate now,
or you're a dead bunny.

106
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,889
- I'll be there with bells on. Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,760
Hello. You're Preston.

108
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,938
- Kit?
- What's left of me. Look.

109
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:35,443
- Is there a hammer in the house?
- Sure.

110
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:41,682
Oh, go right in.

111
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,186
Have a seat.

112
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:50,424
Well, we've been...

113
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,130
- Oh, yeah.
- You better take that off.

114
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,563
I'll get you one of Millie's slippers.

115
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:57,792
Thanks.

116
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,801
I'll put this in your room.

117
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,097
- All right.
- Where is Millie?

118
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:05,033
There was a riot at the station.
She got lost in the shuffle.

119
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,598
What happened?

120
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,836
- I was kidnapped.
- Kidnapped?

121
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,946
By young America.

122
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,710
It seems my literary honor was at stake.
They wanted me to defend it.

123
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,809
- Did you?
- I got out of it.

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,485
Here you are.

125
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,751
- Oh, they're pretty.
- Yeah, they were a Christmas present.

126
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,349
- I'll have your shoe fixed after lunch.
- Thanks.

127
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,485
How about a drink?

128
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:28,496
Oh, no, not for me. Puts me to sleep,
and I have a lecture to give.

129
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,293
Oh, it'll do you good.

130
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,293
I wonder why Millie's not here yet.

131
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,303
Last time I saw her,
she was getting into her car.

132
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,306
- Millie certainly looks well.
- Yes, she does.

133
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:41,069
Oh, did she tell you?
We've got a little something on the way.

134
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,544
- No, what? A baby?
- Well, why not?

135
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
Why not.

136
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,383
Ever since I've known Millie,
the good things of life...

137
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:51,284
seemed to make their way carefully to her.

138
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:55,590
- Does that include me?
- You look all right.

139
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:58,286
- Thanks, so do you.
- Thank you, Preston.

140
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,053
Not quite what I expected.

141
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:06,332
- Here, come on, I can't drink alone.
- Well, maybe one.

142
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,401
- To the next generation.
- Thanks.

143
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,572
You must have a good bootlegger.

144
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,372
Millie dug him up.
I think it's the best bathtub gin in town.

145
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,706
It certainly hits the spot.

146
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,804
Three of them guaranteed
to make you go blind.

147
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,850
Why, there's Millie now.
I wonder why she's walking.

148
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,914
- Anything happen to the car?
- Not that I know of.

149
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,083
Wait.

150
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,127
You know, she's going to be pretty sore
she wasn't here to welcome you.

151
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,857
Maybe you ought to make a new entrance.

152
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,126
- Oh, what an idea.
- No, really, it will make her laugh.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,327
I'll tell you what,
you slip out through the garden...

154
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,927
and when she comes in here, pop in again.

155
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:44,771
- All right.
- Well, come on, hurry.

156
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,943
Oh! My shoes.

157
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,440
Oh, thanks.

158
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,877
- Hello, where's your guest?
- I don't know, and I don't care.

159
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,185
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.

160
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,452
- Where is the car?
- At the depot.

161
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:05,892
- We owe $40.
- $40? For what?

162
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,627
- Milk.
- Milk? That's an awful lot of milk.

163
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,290
- How do you know she drinks milk?
- Who?

164
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,994
Your girlfriend. $40 for milk?
Are you crazy?

165
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,434
Oh, leave me alone!

166
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,698
Now, calm yourself, Millie,
and don't shout.

167
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,296
I will shout. I'm fighting mad!

168
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,275
I've never seen such a display
of bad manners in all my life.

169
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,780
Why, you don't even treat a stranger
like that, let alone your best friend.

170
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:26,906
She could have gotten away
perfectly well, but no...

171
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,110
she had to go running off
with those silly college girls.

172
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,278
She left me standing there, like a...
Like a...

173
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,447
- Oh, so you saw her?
- Yes, I saw her.

174
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,547
She looked like someone
who was selling something.

175
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,855
I'm sure if she'd been a man,
she wouldn't have shaved.

176
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:41,590
No hat, no luggage. Just sprawled out
in the day coach, sleeping peacefully.

177
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,197
What are you shushing me for?

178
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:47,168
Now, honey, you know the doctor said
you shouldn't excite yourself.

179
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,470
That's true.

180
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,107
I mustn't.

181
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,345
But after I'd gone to all this trouble.

182
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,041
Look.

183
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,977
Look.

184
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:07,013
- These cost 60 cents.
- Oh, well, Millie, that's...

185
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,817
That's terrible.

186
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,796
What's that?

187
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,032
She's here!

188
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,296
You... You...

189
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,598
Now, Millie.

190
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,663
- You!
- Millie! Millie, Millie.

191
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,074
Millie, Millie, wait a minute. Wait!

192
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,673
Oh, where's your sense of humor?

193
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,516
Oh. Never a dull moment.

194
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:40,982
Same old Millie.

195
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,087
Where are you going?

196
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:48,096
Oh, I'm sorry things didn't work out.

197
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,522
I still think it was a good idea.

198
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,267
- What happened to you?
- To tell you the truth, I was scared.

199
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,702
I don't blame you.

200
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,865
What did she mean,
I look as if I didn't shave?

201
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,377
Well, don't let that worry you.
I like girls who don't shave.

202
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,909
- She sounded as if she meant it.
- Yeah, I'm afraid she did.

203
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,448
I never thought she'd take it that way.

204
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,921
What do you think we ought to do?

205
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:20,428
Well, I guess we'd better think
of the next generation.

206
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:25,028
- Shall I go up?
- Oh, please do. I'd appreciate it.

207
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,432
Of course.

208
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:31,230
Oh, Kit, I'll have Bertha
put the food on the table.

209
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,707
Will you tell Millie
her man, Drake, is serving?

210
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,403
Very well, Drake.

211
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,878
- Be sure the port is at room temperature.
- Very good, madam.

212
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,353
Millie.

213
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:54,590
Millie.

214
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,100
Millie.

215
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:09,967
Millie, remember you're a hostess,
and you have a guest.

216
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:16,150
We just thought you'd like to be the
first one to welcome me to your house.

217
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:17,947
It was only a joke.

218
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:29,958
Millie.

219
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,491
Millie, have a heart. Let me in.

220
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,064
You never used to mind.

221
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,847
- I can go to a hotel.
- Perhaps you should.

222
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,750
You certainly didn't act
as though you wanted to see me.

223
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,813
Oh, Millie, what could I do?
I couldn't get away from those Amazons.

224
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,722
Everything's gone wrong
from the moment I got up.

225
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,591
I know, Millie, but don't worry about it.

226
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,994
I like your husband.

227
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,093
You were quite right
when you said he was easy on the eyes.

228
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,697
- He's all right, I suppose.
- And you have a lovely home.

229
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,104
It'll do.

230
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:19,209
And it was awfully nice of you
to go to so much trouble for my visit.

231
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:24,514
Come on, Millie, give me a little smile.

232
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,587
And it's so wonderful
you're going to have a baby.

233
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:32,885
Oh!

234
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,861
Oh, I suppose I couldn't even
tell you that myself.

235
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:40,761
What does it matter, Millie,
as long as it's true and I know?

236
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,736
Well, it matters to me.

237
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:46,402
But why? What possible difference
can it make who told me?

238
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,273
You don't know what it's like
to plan to do things a certain way...

239
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,074
and then have them
all go exactly the opposite.

240
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,979
- But, of course, I do.
- Oh, I'm really trembling.

241
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,040
It's so unimportant, Millie.

242
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,223
You have so much to be grateful for.
You should be very happy.

243
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,281
Oh, naturally, I'm happy.

244
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,996
You know, Millie, you're a very lucky girl.

245
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:18,469
I'm not so sure
that I don't envy you just a little.

246
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,175
Kit, I'm really glad you're here.

247
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,481
- I shouldn't have acted so badly.
- Oh, I understand, darling.

248
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,483
And now, your husband
has told me to tell you...

249
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,917
that your butler, Drake,
is waiting to serve lunch.

250
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,977
- Come on, I'm starved.
- Yes, let's go.

251
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,853
Oh, Kit, I've arranged a little party for you,
not too many...

252
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:38,052
just the people I thought
you'd like to see again.

253
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,526
They're really nice people.

254
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,695
Charlie?

255
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,806
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Oh, this stuff is delicious.

256
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,638
Now you've had enough.
I'm gonna take you home.

257
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,768
I don't wanna go home.

258
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,812
It's getting late
and you're the last one to leave.

259
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,576
That's right, pal. You're absolutely right.
It's time to go.

260
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,378
- Which way you live?
- I'm taking you home.

261
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,509
No, I'm taking you home.

262
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:06,384
- Charlie, you're drunk.
- Confidentially, so am I.

263
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,953
- Good night, Kit, old pal.
- Good night, Charlie.

264
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,017
- I gotta get Pres home. See you later, huh?
- You do that.

265
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:15,427
- Kit, you look tired.
- I've had a busy day.

266
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,930
Only a couple of stuffed shirts left.

267
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,398
- Why don't you turn in?
- Oh, thanks.

268
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:19,695
Preston.

269
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,971
Preston, please get Charlie home.
He's so loud.

270
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,835
After all, we have neighbors.

271
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,131
Oh!

272
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,405
- Kit, I'm so sorry. I hate drunkenness.
- Oh, Charlie's a lot of fun.

273
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:32,174
Oh, don't bother about any of this.
Preston will be home in a minute.

274
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:35,307
He'll attend to things, he always does.
Come on, let's just go to bed.

275
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:36,408
All right.

276
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,851
Oh, I could stand a little sleep myself.
My feet are just killing me.

277
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:41,219
I don't think I've been off them
for about two days.

278
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,953
Well, I hope everyone had a good time.
They certainly ate enough, didn't they?

279
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,021
Oh, my.

280
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,164
It must be nice, having a nice man coming
home in a few minutes to see to things.

281
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,930
Yes, a husband can be
a great comfort at times.

282
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,034
What are you going to do about that, Kit?

283
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,132
Well, right now,
I'm concentrating on a book.

284
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,771
Oh, I know that, but what are you
gonna do about your life outside of books?

285
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:06,007
About men, I mean.

286
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,549
- Is there anyone?
- I haven't noticed anyone.

287
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,451
- You're not engaged or anything?
- What do you mean by "or anything"?

288
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,216
- But you're not?
- No.

289
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,883
- Oh, I'm rather surprised.
- So am I.

290
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,622
You know, Kit, I had a real pang of envy
when I read all about your success.

291
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:24,257
But then, afterward, I got to thinking that
being just a woman and a housewife...

292
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,631
- has its compensations.
- Oh, I'm sure they have.

293
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,761
Of course, there are people
who can have both.

294
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,829
- Both what?
- Well, a career and a life.

295
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,743
- What are you getting at?
- Just what I was saying, just now.

296
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,872
It's possible to have the two things,
I'm sure of it.

297
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:41,176
Millie...

298
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,515
you're holding out on me.
What have you been up to?

299
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,918
Yes, there is something.

300
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:49,651
I was going to keep it for a while,
but now I'll tell you.

301
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:53,092
Oh, Kit, promise me you won't breathe
a word to a soul, not even to Preston.

302
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:55,153
It's been my secret for months.

303
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,926
- And, Kit, please don't laugh.
- I won't.

304
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,700
Well. Well, when your book came,
with your name on it...

305
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,365
and my name printed inside,
something happened to me.

306
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,103
Oh, it wasn't jealousy.
I'm above jealousy, you know that.

307
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,907
But I just said to myself, "Here's Kit.

308
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:15,313
"Can sit and write a sad, almost sordid
analysis of two people's lives...

309
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:18,319
"and get marvelous write-ups,
and become a notable overnight.

310
00:17:18,387 --> 00:17:21,515
"And here am I, little Millie Drake,
sitting at home...

311
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,491
"just bubbling over with a message
of quite another sort."

312
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,621
- Then you didn't like my book?
- Oh, I didn't say I didn't like it.

313
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,794
But I don't think
it's really what people want.

314
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,859
Well, as a matter of fact, Millie,
you're probably perfectly right...

315
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:37,303
because in spite of the reviews,
it's not selling.

316
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:39,704
- Oh, isn't it, really?
- No.

317
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,043
Oh, I'm so sorry.

318
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,876
But you see, that's what I mean.

319
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,011
Millie, what are you trying to tell me?
That you've written a book?

320
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,676
Well, why not?

321
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:53,780
Kit, you aren't the only one
who can write a book.

322
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,484
- Well, Millie, darling, I know...
- Wait.

323
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:06,091
Your eyes will be the first, other than
mine, to look down upon my first novel.

324
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:08,829
Why, Millie.

325
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,998
Oh, it's about a boy named Lionel,
and a girl, a wonderful girl.

326
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:14,304
I've called her Deirdre.
I think it's a beautiful name.

327
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,709
The kind of a girl I would have been
if I'd been born in vast spaces.

328
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,544
- Tall and willowy.
- Windblown, you mean?

329
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,174
In a way, yes.

330
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,084
Oh, Kit, will you read it, and if you like it,
take it to the publishers?

331
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,520
- Why, Millie, of course I'll read it.
- Honest?

332
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:29,113
Cross my heart.

333
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,317
It's good and long, isn't it?

334
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,418
Why, I could have gone on
for twice that length.

335
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,690
Only I have another one all dreamed out.

336
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,322
Oh, it's about a girl called Fern.

337
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,492
Look, Millie, you better stick
to one at a time.

338
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,967
Yes, of course.

339
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,469
Kit, if there's anything in beauty...

340
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,007
then the beauty-loving world
has got to know this book.

341
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,804
It simply laughs and cries with people.

342
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,869
- I hope people laugh and cry with it, Millie.
- They will.

343
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,744
Oh, I'm sure, they will.

344
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:56,046
I don't mean to seem egotistical
or overconfident...

345
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,881
but, you know, Kit, I've read a great deal...

346
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,421
and I really think I know
what appeals to most people.

347
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,024
- How'd you think it all up?
- It just came to me.

348
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,525
Kit, I really believe I was born to it.

349
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,328
Writing, I mean.

350
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,058
Once I start, the words just seem
to pour out without my knowing it.

351
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,964
It's like I was in a trance.

352
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:17,101
Millie, you're marvelous.

353
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,307
It took me two years
to write my one book...

354
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,639
and it's taken me 11 months
to even sketch out the second.

355
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:26,147
Well, it could be that I'm more prolific.

356
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,442
Could be.

357
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,812
Millie, after you've written
all these books...

358
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,353
what are you gonna do with the money?

359
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,252
Do you think they'll make money?

360
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:38,292
That kind of a book, if they click at all,
usually make a fortune.

361
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,490
- Kit, do you really think so?
- That tender-young-love stuff always does.

362
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:44,623
Oh, I know exactly what I'd do.

363
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,430
I'd buy the old Crimpton house,
over at the back of Ferndale.

364
00:19:47,502 --> 00:19:50,369
It's such a lovely place.
No neighbors, all those grounds.

365
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,430
I'd have a secretary, two cars...

366
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,203
and when my baby comes,
I'd have an English nanny for it...

367
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,677
and later, a French governess,
that is if it's a girl.

368
00:19:57,746 --> 00:19:59,839
You've got everything all planned out,
haven't you, Millie?

369
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,180
Oh, of course, it's only a dream,
but it's a lovely dream.

370
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:05,777
Success is thrilling, isn't it, Kit?

371
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:08,082
I guess so, Millie.

372
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,319
But it's funny how soon you get used to it.

373
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,658
I never should.
I'd always want more and more.

374
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,789
Don't you want to go on to bigger things?

375
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:20,858
Oh, I don't know about bigger things.
Other things, perhaps.

376
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:23,496
- Such as?
- I don't know.

377
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:27,033
- I'd like to write a play.
- A play?

378
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:30,010
Yes. An opening night must be thrilling.

379
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,876
All the people calling, "Author, author."

380
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,746
But you know, Kit,
I think I'll just stick to my books.

381
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:40,280
- What's so funny?
- Millie, you're so wonderful.

382
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:48,589
- Where are your pajama pants?
- Oh, I never use them.

383
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,325
- No?
- No.

384
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,967
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm dead.

385
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:57,398
Oh, Kit, it's like old times, isn't it?
Late at night, long talks.

386
00:20:57,472 --> 00:21:00,669
All we need is Mama saying,
"Now, don't you two girls talk all night."

387
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,733
Yes, and knocking on the wall
to tell us to stop.

388
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:03,869
Yes.

389
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:08,947
Millie, remember,
whenever we were in the dumps...

390
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,678
your mother used to say...

391
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:14,586
"Don't worry, girls.
There's always what's left of the icing."

392
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,823
I remember.

393
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:22,656
- Good night, Kit.
- Good night, Millie.

394
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,390
Oh, Kit, won't it be marvelous?

395
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:29,460
Two friends, both writers
both such successes?

396
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,903
Oh, Millie.

397
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,331
Well, I'll leave you, then,
to Deirdre and Lionel.

398
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:35,603
- Hey!
- Oh!

399
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,377
Preston, will you please lock the door?
Remember, we have a guest.

400
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,277
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:43,978
- Hey!
- Oh, I am sorry.

402
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,280
Preston.

403
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,149
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Millie.

404
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:09,935
Yes, what is it?

405
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:12,374
Come in.

406
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,343
- Where's Millie?
- I guess she went to her room.

407
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:18,576
Oh.

408
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,485
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

409
00:22:23,392 --> 00:22:25,622
I put some ice water in there
this afternoon.

410
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:27,685
- I just had a drink, thanks.
- Good.

411
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,621
- Good night.
- Good night.

412
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:39,671
- Oh, thanks about this morning.
- Oh, that was nothing.

413
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,276
- Good night.
- Good night.

414
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:50,648
- It's fun having you here, Kit.
- Well, it's fun being here.

415
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,251
- Breakfast at 10:00.
- All right.

416
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,316
- Good night.
- Good night.

417
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:11,766
<i>"Married in June,</i>
by Mildred Watson Drake."

418
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:32,286
As a matter of fact...

419
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,022
I knew nothing of my wife's first book
until the day it was published.

420
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:37,292
Our little girl was born
in the middle of the night...

421
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,230
and the following morning,
on my breakfast table...

422
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,428
there was Millie's book
in a very gay cover.

423
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,630
Now, that's charming.
That's very charming.

424
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,104
And that was how long ago?

425
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,734
Well, Deirdre will be eight next month,
so it must be almost eight years ago.

426
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,176
The first child and the first book
came together.

427
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:53,976
That's right, and there were
seven more afterwards.

428
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:55,414
One a year?

429
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:57,546
Not bad.

430
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,045
Books, not children. Only one child.

431
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,323
The books keep Millie pretty busy,
you know?

432
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:04,790
I should think so.

433
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,586
And they've all been such great successes.

434
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:09,653
Yes, they've been
a dream come true for Millie.

435
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:11,164
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.

436
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:15,431
She has the house that she wanted,
servants. All the things that women like.

437
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,498
You must be very proud of her.

438
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,303
Yes, I suppose I am.

439
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:26,814
- Does she discuss her books with you?
- Me? Oh, no.

440
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,873
I'm afraid I wouldn't be much use to her.

441
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,851
Then you're completely detached
from Mrs. Drake's work.

442
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,282
No more than she is detached from mine.

443
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:36,984
Oh. Do you work, too?

444
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,756
Well, I'm a sort of
a combination architect and engineer.

445
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,820
Oh, now, that's very interesting.

446
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,334
Now, please, don't put anything
down there about me. Leave me out of it.

447
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,528
In fact, I think you ought to let her
tell you the story.

448
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:49,797
She'd do it beautifully.

449
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,964
- She really is an amazing woman.
- I'm sure she is.

450
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,507
She'll be back soon. Out shopping.

451
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,634
- We don't often come to New York.
- I see.

452
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,736
Well, then you must be here for the
opening of Miss Marlowe's play tonight.

453
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:00,280
- That's it.
- It's her first, isn't it?

454
00:25:00,348 --> 00:25:01,906
Yes, and nothing would keep us away.

455
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:04,611
Kit's one of the family.
She's a darling, really.

456
00:25:05,353 --> 00:25:07,787
You say that
as though you really meant it.

457
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,619
Quite frankly, I do.

458
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:17,458
Hello.

459
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,191
No, I'm afraid Miss Marlowe is not here.

460
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,169
Oh, you are leaving the theater. Yes, I see.

461
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,899
It'll be a pleasure.

462
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:29,137
Miss Broadbank. Butterfield, 8-4-6.

463
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:32,105
Certainly.

464
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,346
- Miss Broadbank?
- Yes, indeed.

465
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:38,511
- And who is she when she's at home?
- She's starring in Miss Marlowe's play.

466
00:25:38,587 --> 00:25:40,521
We've certainly got to see her.

467
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,547
- Deedy, Deedy, you're too fast for me.
- Well, hello, hello!

468
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,957
- Give me a big kiss!
- Hello, Daddy.

469
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,292
- Hello, Preston.
- Hello, Kit.

470
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,058
You just missed Miss Broadbank.

471
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:51,589
Was she here?

472
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,100
No, but she nearly jumped through
that telephone. You better call her.

473
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:55,193
I will.

474
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,738
Oh, this is Miss Belle Carter,
<i>The News Post.</i>

475
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,570
- Oh, hello, Miss Carter.
- How do you do, Miss Marlowe?

476
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,078
- This is Miss Deirdre Drake.
- How do you do, Miss Drake?

477
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,574
How do you like
your daughter's new outfit?

478
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,446
Now, that is something. Well.

479
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,880
The very latest thing in winter fashions.

480
00:26:12,954 --> 00:26:15,081
It's lovely, Kit,
but you shouldn't have done it.

481
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,522
- Why not? I enjoyed it.
- You know, this kind of thing...

482
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:19,787
has been going on between these two
ever since she was born.

483
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,091
Well, she's really partly mine, anyway.

484
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,654
I was at the hospital when she was born.

485
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,600
As a matter of fact,
she gave me her first smile.

486
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:29,702
Her mother said it was gas.

487
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,936
- That wasn't true, was it, Deedy?
- No.

488
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,675
Well, young lady,
where have you two been today?

489
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:39,441
- Oh, we went to the zoo and to the stores.
- We went everywhere, Pres.

490
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:42,409
Are you very excited
about the opening of your play tonight?

491
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:44,577
Well, I've been trying to forget it all day.

492
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:47,554
Every time I think about it,
I get butterflies in my stomach.

493
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:51,653
Come on, Deedy.

494
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,717
We'll see if <i>Mademoiselle</i>
has your supper ready.

495
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:56,127
- Excuse us, Miss Carter.
- I'm not hungry.

496
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,665
Now, you go and eat, and drink your milk.

497
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,566
That must be Mrs. Drake.
I'll tell her you're here, Miss Carter.

498
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,126
She'll be right out.

499
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,967
- Hello, Millie.
- Hello.

500
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,642
- Oh, what's the matter?
- Who's out there?

501
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,203
Oh, Kit, your daughter,
and a lady of the press, why?

502
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,044
I'm desperately tired.
You knew I would be.

503
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,310
Too much shopping?

504
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,409
I didn't get half the things done
I planned to do.

505
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:21,216
Just wait till you see Deedy,
and you'll forget all about being tired.

506
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:23,189
You haven't been calling the child
that silly name...

507
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:25,556
in front of a reporter, have you?
I wish you wouldn't.

508
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:28,187
Very good, madam.
But wait till you see her anyway.

509
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,390
Kit's bought her a new outfit.
They've just come in.

510
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:33,263
Why does she keep her out so late?
Upsets her whole routine.

511
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:34,768
They've had a marvelous time.

512
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,929
Been on a bender,
both of them completely cockeyed.

513
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,439
Preston, I'm in no mood
for your silly jokes.

514
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,769
Now, Millie, you're tired.
Let me fix you a nice, big drink.

515
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:46,207
- How many have you had?
- Fourteen or fifteen.

516
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:47,475
Oh, stop being funny.

517
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:50,347
Preston, you know I don't like you
to drink in the daytime.

518
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,319
- It's as good a time as any.
- Oh, Preston.

519
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:56,551
Millie, you better see that press lady.
I told her as much as I could.

520
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,593
- What did you tell her?
- Oh, how brilliant and capable you are...

521
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:02,027
and how we regard life
from our pinnacle of success.

522
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,122
But, Preston, I've asked you
a thousand times...

523
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,827
- to let me handle my own interviews.
- I had to be polite.

524
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:09,369
Well, next time,
please talk about something else.

525
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,999
Millie, I...

526
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:16,071
- Millie, you look like the Queen of Sheba.
- Oh, thanks.

527
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:19,136
But, I had my hair done this afternoon.
New girl, dreadful.

528
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:22,843
She just chatted at me all the time.
I thought she'd never stop talking.

529
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:25,909
Millie, Miss Carter asked me to tell you
she can't wait very much longer.

530
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:27,318
Yes, I know. I'm going.

531
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,256
Pres tell you I stole your daughter
this afternoon? We went shopping.

532
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:32,793
He told me. Time you had one of your own.

533
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:35,886
Oh, how do you do, Miss Carter?

534
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,600
Well, I'd better call that Broadbank wench.

535
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,664
- Where did she say she'd be?
- She was just leaving the theater.

536
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:49,232
She must be home then.

537
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:53,442
- Kit, will you tell me something?
- Yes, what?

538
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,540
I've been wanting to ask you for years.

539
00:28:55,617 --> 00:28:58,882
- Why are you and Millie such friends?
- Oh, Pres, what a thing to ask.

540
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,854
I mean it. It can't just be
because you were girls together.

541
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:04,187
Well, that counts
for more than you'd think.

542
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,092
Hello? Miss Julia Broadbank.
Miss Marlowe calling.

543
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:09,923
Thank you.

544
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:13,098
Millie remembers the same things I do.
That's important.

545
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,568
For instance,
I think she's the only one I know...

546
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,537
who remembers
when I used to be called Chunky.

547
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,664
I shouldn't think
you'd want anyone to remember that.

548
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:22,904
I know, but one does.
It's funny, but one does.

549
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,944
What? Well...

550
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:28,840
All right, I'll wait.

551
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,679
Besides that, I owe Millie a great deal.

552
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,087
On my very first day at school...

553
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:36,521
she took me by the hand
and brought me home...

554
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,650
and said to her mother very solemnly...

555
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:43,026
"Mama, this is Katherine Marlowe
who's going to my very best friend."

556
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,561
What? No, she called me.

557
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:51,003
And then, when my aunt died,
her home was the only real home I had.

558
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:55,199
Her mother and father couldn't have been
nicer to me if I'd been their own daughter.

559
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,937
Millie's really all right, Pres.

560
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:02,276
Kit, you're just what I always thought
you were, a pretty nice person.

561
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,647
Oh, pooh.

562
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,279
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't been around all these years.

563
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,912
Just to look at you...

564
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,017
I know, my...

565
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:14,186
My fatal beauty drives men mad.

566
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,629
I don't have to tell you, do I?

567
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:20,692
Miss Broadbank, I was told you called.

568
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, I'm returning your call.

569
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:26,736
My dear Miss Broadbank,
that is not what I said at all.

570
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,275
I love you so much.

571
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,670
Pres, I've begged you not
to ever say that to me.

572
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:35,745
No. No, I did not go to the theater
this afternoon.

573
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,815
Because I'm sick and tired of arguing.

574
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:44,989
I don't care what you wear
in the second act.

575
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:46,619
What?

576
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:49,455
You can wear spangles if you want to.

577
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:53,997
Kit. Kit, Mommy wants me to go to bed!
Do I have to?

578
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:58,430
You should save your voice for tonight.
Goodbye.

579
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:01,839
Kit, can't I stay up until you leave?
I don't wanna go to bed yet.

580
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,003
- Aren't you sleepy, old lady?
- No.

581
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:05,812
I don't wanna go yet.

582
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,848
Deedy, you and I are in the doghouse.

583
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:09,683
Now, if you really want to help...

584
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,616
you'll go to bed quickly
and go right to sleep.

585
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,382
Because if you don't, your mother'll
never let us go out together again.

586
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,820
Do you hear?

587
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,517
- Good night, angel.
- Good night.

588
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,658
- Go on.
- Daddy, give me a piggyback.

589
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,559
- You're too fat.
- I am not.

590
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:24,959
Giddyup.

591
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,265
Kit, I meant every word I said.

592
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,100
Take me out again tomorrow, Kit?

593
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,871
- I'll try.
- Okay, good night.

594
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:43,144
- Giddyup.
- I'm galloping already.

595
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:45,117
You are not. Giddyup.

596
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:58,065
- Thank you so much, Mrs. Drake.
- I've enjoyed it.

597
00:31:58,132 --> 00:31:59,497
Oh, Kit, I'm glad you've come in.

598
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,467
Miss Carter wanted
to say goodbye to you.

599
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,629
It's been an honor and a pleasure,
Miss Marlowe.

600
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:05,434
I wish I could do a story on you sometime.

601
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,371
She always says she hates publicity.

602
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:09,637
Well, some other time, perhaps.
It's been so nice.

603
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:11,474
Tell me, how is your new book
coming along?

604
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,606
Well, I write, and I rewrite,
and I still don't like it.

605
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,809
But at least, when you do turn one out,
it's a gem.

606
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,852
None of this
grinding them out like sausage...

607
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,594
- I suppose I could cut my throat.
- There's a knife on the table.

608
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:34,398
Miss Carter, I'm sure you'll excuse us.
We have a million things to do.

609
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:38,902
- Good luck for tonight, Miss Marlowe.
- Thank you. Bye.

610
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:46,180
Thank heavens I don't have to write
for literary snobs like that one.

611
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:48,579
What difference does it make
what she said?

612
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,619
At least, I don't labor over my writing,
and I'm proud of it.

613
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:54,484
If I have more facility than others,
that's my good luck.

614
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,914
And you can take comfort
in the knowledge...

615
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,720
that your books sell and mine don't.

616
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:01,318
Well, I deliberately write
for the great, broad public.

617
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,230
- Of course, and I wish I knew the secret.
- I wish you did, too.

618
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:08,791
I'd be much happier if you were
more successful financially, Kit.

619
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,200
Well, I'm willing. What do you suggest?

620
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,605
Well, there are a lot of things.
For instance...

621
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:18,271
is it laziness or affectation that you
don't like to see your name in print?

622
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,541
Why, there are posters all over the place
about your play...

623
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:23,550
and your name isn't any size.
It's all Julia Broadbank.

624
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:26,177
Her name will bring in
more people than mine.

625
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,313
But you're the author, you wrote the play.

626
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,983
Why should you be
pushed off the mat by actors?

627
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:34,495
Well, to tell you the truth, Millie,
I'm not so sure the play's any good.

628
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:36,553
Oh, you make me furious.

629
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:40,397
Now, supposing I started one of my books
with the attitude I wasn't sure about it.

630
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:43,301
- Where would I be?
- Where I am, probably.

631
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,266
But you must remember, Millie...

632
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,637
you've never not been sure
about anything.

633
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,342
- You mean I'm too sure?
- I didn't say that.

634
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:54,181
But you must admit,
you're a very certain little woman.

635
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,012
Perhaps, I am. But I certainly
couldn't see myself at our age...

636
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,950
waving in the breeze
like a piece of limp rag.

637
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,647
You don't seem to know, or care...

638
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,213
what's gonna happen to you
from one minute to the next.

639
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,818
Now, when I make up my mind
I want something, I work until I get it.

640
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:09,795
Then I hold onto it
like a bulldog with his teeth.

641
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:13,523
There are some things
you will hold on to too tightly, Millie.

642
00:34:13,601 --> 00:34:15,034
Especially people.

643
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:19,229
Oh, people are a nuisance.
The only people I need are in my books.

644
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,071
Outside of Preston and my baby,
no one means anything.

645
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,237
Me, too?

646
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:28,238
You go without saying,
but you do make me mad.

647
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,351
Oh, Kit, hasn't there ever been anything
in your life that you've really wanted?

648
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,051
Well, coming right at this moment,
that's a hard question to answer.

649
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:44,054
But you keep holding on, darling,
and I'll keep wondering whether I should.

650
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:47,265
And I may wave around
like that limp rag...

651
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:51,901
but there is a certain ecstasy
in wanting things you know you can't get.

652
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,204
Well, you might be
a very lonely old lady one day.

653
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,040
Something I'll never be. I took care of that.

654
00:35:00,248 --> 00:35:02,512
When you married Preston
and had Deirdre...

655
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,244
and that put money in the bank.

656
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,687
What better insurance could I have?

657
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,250
Millie...

658
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:14,393
- now, I want to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

659
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:17,788
Why aren't you more considerate of Pres?

660
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:21,162
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

661
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:23,501
What are you talking about?

662
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,801
Certainly, you can see
how miserable he is.

663
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:27,135
Miserable!

664
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,200
Why, haven't I been a good wife to him?
I've given him everything.

665
00:35:30,278 --> 00:35:32,576
A house, grounds, servants.

666
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:37,147
Why, I make him a definite department
in my life, as I do my child.

667
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,386
How can you say he's miserable?

668
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:43,718
Millie, do you know anything at all
about men?

669
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,885
Do you?

670
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:51,528
Well, I know there are a lot of little things
that a man expects from a woman...

671
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,269
that I think you, in your success,
have forgotten all about.

672
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:56,893
What little things?

673
00:35:57,538 --> 00:36:02,100
Oh, little things, like humor
and charm and tenderness.

674
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:06,011
Oh, should I be charming,
humorous and tender...

675
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,277
when a man consumes nearly
a bottle of whisky in an afternoon?

676
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,151
- People drink for escape, Millie.
- But escape from what?

677
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:17,052
Well, our offspring is in the hay.

678
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:19,649
Drinking again, my love?

679
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:24,227
No, but I'll pour one for you if you want it.

680
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:27,790
- Do you really think I should?
- Why not? We only live once.

681
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,264
Say when.

682
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,073
- Hey, when.
- There you are.

683
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,172
- And some ice?
- Thanks.

684
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:38,708
There. Oh, Preston,
I bought you two dinner-jacket ties.

685
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,304
They're the new kind from Paris,
with the single end.

686
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,316
Oh, that's very nice of you, Millie.

687
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,681
Hey, what's going on with you two?
What's the joke?

688
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:54,227
Oh, our Kit's in a very
rambunctious mood today.

689
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,662
I think I must write a play sometime,
and see if I can feel rambunctious.

690
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:00,962
I'm sure you will, Millie.

691
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:03,868
I really must go.

692
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,399
Oh, no, I've something for you, too.

693
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,835
Something for my very best friend...

694
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,879
to commemorate
the first night of her first play.

695
00:37:11,946 --> 00:37:13,106
I'll only be a moment.

696
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,910
They're on the little table in here
by the chaise longue.

697
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,281
I separated them from the other things.

698
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,923
The sun seems to be shining.

699
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:26,184
Yes.

700
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,656
I wonder what caused it.

701
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,227
Well, now, here they are.

702
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:33,961
- This is for my husband.
- Thank you, Millie.

703
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:35,969
And this is for my best friend.

704
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,600
This is just a little thing
I picked up for myself.

705
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,733
I think when you open it, darling,
you'll find it's quite charming.

706
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,275
Thank you, Millie.

707
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:53,219
Millie, you can't give me things like this.

708
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:55,915
Well, why not? I think it's very beautiful.

709
00:37:56,324 --> 00:37:58,258
It's almost too beautiful to wear.

710
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,621
It must have cost a fortune.

711
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,459
Well, I'm a very successful woman
and very rich.

712
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:07,790
- Do you really like it, darling?
- I don't know what to say.

713
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:10,936
Here. Put it on your coat.

714
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,138
Oh, it looks very smart. There.

715
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,807
- What did you get for yourself?
- Just these.

716
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,006
And very nice, too.

717
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,881
- Do you like them, Preston?
- They're very handsome.

718
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:28,047
I wish I could afford
to have given them to you.

719
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,448
They're lovely, Millie.

720
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:34,960
- Do you resent my having them?
- Of course not, Millie.

721
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:38,226
I don't resent your having anything.
I said they were very handsome.

722
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,468
What's the matter, Millie?

723
00:38:41,535 --> 00:38:43,093
We both said they were very nice...

724
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,401
and you suddenly look like a volcano
that's about to erupt.

725
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,738
- You can't make a joke of it.
- Make a joke of what?

726
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,970
You wish you could've afforded
to buy them for me.

727
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,411
- If that isn't a sneer...
- It was not a sneer.

728
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:54,709
Millie.

729
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,041
Millie, let me put them on you.

730
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,113
- Be good.
- Oh.

731
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:01,284
Anyone would think I was...

732
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:04,251
I'll do without them!
I'll do without everything!

733
00:39:04,325 --> 00:39:05,519
I'll give up writing!

734
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,426
We'll go back and pig it on Cameo Street,
the way we used to.

735
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,930
- Is that what you want?
- Millie, will you stop this, please?

736
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,761
No, Millie, we'd better stay just as we are.

737
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,130
You can buy me a nice uniform...

738
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,499
and on the cap and collar
you can put M-W-D...

739
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,130
the property of Mildred Watson Drake,
in diamonds.

740
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,561
Pres.

741
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,564
Here.

742
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:59,179
I'm really partly to blame.

743
00:39:59,713 --> 00:40:03,615
I had just given Millie
a sort of bawling out before you came in.

744
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:07,714
Go in there and apologize.

745
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:12,283
And no more of that uniform business.

746
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,258
It wasn't kind.

747
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,098
I'll leave your tickets at the box office.

748
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,701
See you later.

749
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:44,018
Kit's gone.

750
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:54,026
I'm sorry, Millie. Here are the clips.

751
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:58,262
You can throw them in the wastebasket.
You didn't pay for them.

752
00:41:00,674 --> 00:41:01,868
All right then.

753
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,527
What do you think you're doing?

754
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:25,122
"'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'to talk of many things:

755
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,397
"'Of socks and shirts and dressing gowns,
and whether pigs have wings."'

756
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,230
You're drunk.

757
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:33,796
Oh, no, Millie, I'm not,
but I am very happy.

758
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,206
Is this your nail file, or mine?
I never knew.

759
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:39,007
Preston, will you stop playing the fool,
and get dressed for tonight?

760
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,410
I am dressed for my night.

761
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,039
But you have to wear your dinner jacket.

762
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:43,242
I won't need my dinner jacket.

763
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:45,148
Oh, we went into all that
before we left home.

764
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:46,846
I had the new silk facings put on.

765
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,219
New silk facings! Thoughtful little Millie.

766
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,453
Preston, I don't know what this
is all about, but it's no time to go into it.

767
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:54,721
We've got to get dressed,
and go and see Kit's play.

768
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,730
I am sorry about one thing,
I hate leaving that baby.

769
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:01,359
- What did you say?
- I said, I hated leaving my daughter.

770
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:03,637
Preston. Preston, you're mad.

771
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:05,797
I was mad not to have done this years ago.

772
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:09,138
You don't need a husband.
What you need is... Oh, why go into it?

773
00:42:09,243 --> 00:42:10,471
Just where are you going?

774
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,205
As far away as I can get
from you, my dear.

775
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,576
You don't know what you're talking about.

776
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:15,444
- Oh, yes, I do.
- You've been drinking all that whisky.

777
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:16,983
- It's not the whisky.
- You can't do this to me.

778
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,713
- You can't just walk...
- Stop it, Millie! No more scenes.

779
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,516
I never was much good at them.

780
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,784
As you would say in one of your books...

781
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:26,485
"And so ended this chapter in their life."

782
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,419
- Good luck, my dear.
- Preston.

783
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:33,093
Preston!

784
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:37,261
- Preston!
- Down.

785
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:38,996
Preston!

786
00:42:49,216 --> 00:42:51,741
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Mr. Preston Drake, please.

787
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,480
- Are you Miss Marlowe?
- Yes.

788
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:56,249
Oh, yes, he's been trying to reach you.
He was around here a minute ago.

789
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,019
- I think you'll find him in the lounge.
- Oh, thank you.

790
00:43:12,539 --> 00:43:13,631
Pres.

791
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,665
- Hello, Kit.
- Hello.

792
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:18,139
- Don't bother.
- How'd the play go? I bet it was great.

793
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:19,804
- It was all right, I guess.
- Good.

794
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,644
Pres, I've just seen Millie.
She's very upset.

795
00:43:22,816 --> 00:43:25,785
- She'll get over it.
- What do you mean, "She'll get over it"?

796
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,450
Pres, you're hardly a child.

797
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,581
How a grown man
can be hiding away here...

798
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,786
just for the fun of torturing his wife,
is beyond me.

799
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,262
- I'm sorry, Kit, but it's over.
- Don't be ridiculous.

800
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:39,895
You can save your breath, Kit. I'm through.

801
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:49,995
Have you got a cigarette?

802
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:55,037
Thank you.

803
00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:57,745
Pres, this is very serious.

804
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:01,578
Kit, I couldn't stand it any longer.
It's been building up for a long time.

805
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:05,781
And today, something clicked
and said, "Now." And now it was.

806
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:09,184
Well, something chose
a peach of a time to say it...

807
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:11,351
on my opening night.

808
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:14,158
I'm sorry if you were bothered.
I didn't mean to involve you.

809
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,460
But Harriet said you called three times.

810
00:44:17,334 --> 00:44:19,666
What I had to say to you
was not about Millie.

811
00:44:21,004 --> 00:44:24,804
Pres, you simply must not do this.
It's nothing that can't be straightened out.

812
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:26,999
You two wouldn't
have lived together happily...

813
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:28,203
It wasn't happy.

814
00:44:28,278 --> 00:44:31,372
Well, you two wouldn't
have lived together, then, for nine years...

815
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:33,916
if there hadn't been strong ties
between you.

816
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:37,441
Kit, when I married Millie, she was
a sweet, pretty little girl. It was fun.

817
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,544
But, Pres...

818
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:42,455
But our marriage has been headed for the
rocks ever since Millie started to write.

819
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:43,685
I don't have to tell you.

820
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,160
When Deedy was so sick that time
it was you who took care of her.

821
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:47,457
Millie was in Mexico.

822
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,589
I get a chance of a big contract
in Philadelphia...

823
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,224
I can't leave, Millie's in California.

824
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:55,465
But, Pres, whatever may have happened
to Millie is only superficial.

825
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,368
If you just look at Millie's activities
as a confession of weakness...

826
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:02,900
an admission that there's something
essentially lacking in her nature...

827
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:05,539
you'd find it a little touching,
and love her for it.

828
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:08,311
- You sound like one of Millie's books.
- Do I?

829
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,613
That's rather a joke on me, isn't it?

830
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:16,225
That seems to be that, then.

831
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:20,863
It's not so serious. It happens every day.

832
00:45:22,232 --> 00:45:25,030
Kit, there's something I've got to ask you.

833
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:27,069
It has nothing to do
with my leaving Millie.

834
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,867
Miss Marlowe,
you're wanted on the phone.

835
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:31,670
Oh, thank you.

836
00:45:32,842 --> 00:45:34,469
You can take it in here.

837
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:36,974
Thank you.

838
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:58,127
- Hiya, bub.
- Hello.

839
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:00,660
- Great weather we're having.
- Yeah.

840
00:46:01,137 --> 00:46:02,297
You the guy?

841
00:46:02,372 --> 00:46:04,533
- What guy?
- The guy that wanted Scotch.

842
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:06,541
- You've got Scotch?
- No, I got gin.

843
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:08,236
- How much?
- $10.

844
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:09,637
Okay.

845
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:22,317
Hey, bub.

846
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:24,717
You don't have to worry about that stuff.

847
00:46:24,794 --> 00:46:27,592
I make it myself. Here's my card.

848
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:43,440
That was my apartment.
I'm having a party.

849
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:46,515
It was my opening night, remember?
I'm a hostess.

850
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:49,450
Kit, I told you I wanted
to ask you something.

851
00:46:49,652 --> 00:46:53,281
I know you did,
but this is no time to talk about us.

852
00:46:53,356 --> 00:46:56,291
Pres, you know that. Now I really must go.

853
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:58,521
It means such a lot to me.

854
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,188
Kit, you must listen.

855
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,434
Please, sit down. Just for a minute.

856
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:21,110
Kit, you mean everything to me.

857
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,716
The thought of you,
the mention of your name.

858
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:28,880
Kit, I am really in love with you,
deeply in love with you.

859
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:33,254
Look me straight me in the eyes
and tell me you don't feel as I do.

860
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:40,994
I'm never going back to Millie.

861
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,267
So, don't let that make any difference
in what you say, but tell me.

862
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,864
Tell me the truth.

863
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,072
Pres, I haven't let myself
even think about it.

864
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:51,443
Why not?

865
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:55,245
Because there are things you just don't do.

866
00:47:56,352 --> 00:47:57,785
There are things...

867
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:02,321
that a woman just can't do
and this is one of them.

868
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:05,060
Kit, this is our chance for a happy life.

869
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:08,097
That might be, Pres,
if things were different.

870
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:09,859
It's the only chance.

871
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:14,495
There's no such thing as an only chance.
Life goes on.

872
00:48:15,138 --> 00:48:17,333
Pres, Millie would always be between us...

873
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,103
spoiling any chance of happiness
that we might find.

874
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,603
There are things that you just don't do...

875
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,648
if you want to live decently
with yourself afterwards.

876
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:29,214
Do you mean to stand there and tell me
that your friendship for Millie...

877
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:31,549
would mean more to you
than your love for me?

878
00:48:32,322 --> 00:48:35,052
Pres, I know it's hard
for a man to understand.

879
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:38,389
All I know is that it's something
I just couldn't do...

880
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:42,522
whether it was Millie, or any other woman
who is a friend of mine.

881
00:48:46,235 --> 00:48:48,726
I guess it wasn't meant to be, Pres.

882
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:57,175
That was Millie on the phone.
She's on her way here now.

883
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,041
I told her to come.

884
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:02,113
Pres, talk to her, give her a chance.

885
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:05,687
Don't just throw away nine years
without at least talking to her.

886
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:10,457
Kit, you know I'd do anything for you.
Anything but that.

887
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:13,791
Oh, Pres, don't be stubborn.
Please, for my sake, see her.

888
00:49:14,631 --> 00:49:17,395
I'm sorry, Kit,
but that's one thing I won't do.

889
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,967
Well, I guess that's goodbye then.

890
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:30,844
I guess it is.

891
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:33,838
May I kiss you goodbye?

892
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:37,714
No, Pres.

893
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:44,324
Goodbye, Kit.

894
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,960
Pres...

895
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:54,128
come here.

896
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:04,204
Goodbye.

897
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,013
Goodbye, Kit.

898
00:50:10,353 --> 00:50:12,844
Will you keep an eye on Deirdre for me?

899
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:15,152
I'd kind of like her to grow up like you.

900
00:50:15,258 --> 00:50:16,555
Of course.

901
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:30,595
If anyone asks for me, anyone at all,
I don't want to be disturbed. Understand?

902
00:50:30,673 --> 00:50:32,197
Very good, Mr. Drake.

903
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,772
Hello, Millie.

904
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:08,304
- Where is he, Kit?
- He's gone to his room. He won't see you.

905
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:10,368
He won't see me? But why not?

906
00:51:10,446 --> 00:51:12,744
Let's not talk about it here. Let's go home.

907
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:13,907
Wait.

908
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,742
- I want to see Mr. Preston Drake, please.
- Mr. Drake does not wish to be disturbed.

909
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,515
Well, then let me speak to him
on the telephone.

910
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:21,750
But I've just told you,
he doesn't wish to be disturbed.

911
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:24,622
But he's my husband.
I'm Mrs. Drake. Don't you understand?

912
00:51:24,694 --> 00:51:27,128
Lady, I don't care if you're Admiral Drake,
those are my orders.

913
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:29,061
Where's the manager?
I want to speak to the manager!

914
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:30,326
I am the night manager.

915
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:33,231
Millie, come in here a minute.
There's nothing you can do about it.

916
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:36,465
But how can he do this to me?
We were always so happy together.

917
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:37,870
Nine years of bliss...

918
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,000
and now he's in that room up there
and he won't even see me.

919
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:42,203
Millie, be quiet.

920
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:44,576
Oh, he's ruined my life,
that's what he's done.

921
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,638
I've nothing left to live for. Nothing.

922
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:49,750
I should have thrown myself
out the window like I planned.

923
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,650
Millie, don't talk nonsense.

924
00:51:52,054 --> 00:51:55,922
Oh, how can I face people?
How can I tell them that he's left me?

925
00:51:55,992 --> 00:51:59,985
Everybody envied me so.
They thought I had everything, and I did.

926
00:52:01,063 --> 00:52:04,362
A husband and a home,
and a baby and a career.

927
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:08,995
Well, Millie you still have your home
and your baby and your career.

928
00:52:09,071 --> 00:52:13,906
- No, I'll never write another line!
- Don't say such silly things, Millie.

929
00:52:13,976 --> 00:52:16,376
In a few months,
you'll be in the middle of a new book...

930
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:18,276
and will have forgotten all about this.

931
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:22,408
Oh, they say you can lose yourself
in your work. I wish I could believe that.

932
00:52:23,653 --> 00:52:27,316
- Do you think it's true, Kit?
- That's what they say, Millie.

933
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:30,882
Perhaps, I can.
Perhaps, it'll even be good for my work.

934
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:32,422
Oh, I'm going to try.

935
00:52:32,495 --> 00:52:35,293
I'm going to make
a whole new life for myself.

936
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,093
Oh, I know I can, with you to help me.

937
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:40,033
- You will help me, won't you, Kit?
- Of course, Millie.

938
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:41,535
It'll be like old times.

939
00:52:41,604 --> 00:52:45,096
Making plans,
and talking things over for the future.

940
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:50,043
Oh, Kit, we'll always be friends, won't we?
Nothing will ever happen to us, will it?

941
00:52:50,112 --> 00:52:52,376
Nothing will ever come between us?

942
00:52:52,448 --> 00:52:57,181
Millie, we'll probably end up two deaf,
old ladies sharing the same ear trumpet.

943
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,782
Oh, Kit.

944
00:52:59,055 --> 00:53:02,081
I don't know what I'd do
without you to turn to.

945
00:53:05,194 --> 00:53:07,890
Cheer up, Millie. Cheer up.

946
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:12,325
There's always what's left of the icing.

947
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:25,510
<i>Mr. Chairman,</i>
<i>members of the Red Cross...</i>

948
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,175
<i>ladies and gentleman</i>
<i>of the radio audience.</i>

949
00:53:28,818 --> 00:53:33,448
<i>Our country and its allies</i>
<i>are engaged in a fierce and terrible war.</i>

950
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:38,116
<i>It is doubtful whether we shall realize</i>
<i>how vast and terrible it is...</i>

951
00:53:38,361 --> 00:53:40,295
<i>until long after it is over.</i>

952
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:44,790
<i>Nevertheless, we have dedicated our lives</i>
<i>and our resources...</i>

953
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:48,132
<i>to the complete and final destruction</i>
<i>of the enemy.</i>

954
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:52,803
<i>We know, too, that in God's good time,</i>
<i>we shall win.</i>

955
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:56,775
<i>In the same way, I think,</i>
<i>we should be proud of the Red Cross.</i>

956
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:59,171
<i>For more than 75 years...</i>

957
00:53:59,248 --> 00:54:02,809
<i>it has been a beacon of mercy</i>
<i>a symbol of humanity.</i>

958
00:54:03,386 --> 00:54:05,752
<i>It assists in your local neighborhood...</i>

959
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:09,915
<i>safeguarding the lives and health</i>
<i>of the civilian population.</i>

960
00:54:10,426 --> 00:54:14,260
<i>It operates with the army in the fields,</i>
<i>and goes to distant outposts.</i>

961
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:18,162
<i>It accompanies the navy</i>
<i>to outlying naval stations.</i>

962
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:22,470
<i>It is with the men in hospitals,</i>
<i>wherever general hospitals are located.</i>

963
00:54:22,672 --> 00:54:25,539
<i>And through its staff</i>
<i>and military stations...</i>

964
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:28,509
<i>it provides</i>
<i>the important link of communication...</i>

965
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,635
<i>between the service man...</i>

966
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:31,236
- Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Surely.

967
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:33,009
<i>... and his family back home.</i>

968
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:37,818
<i>And the only creed it knows,</i>
<i>is the creed of humanity.</i>

969
00:54:38,321 --> 00:54:41,449
<i>It is always there</i>
<i>wherever people need help.</i>

970
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:44,649
<i>And the reason this can be done...</i>

971
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:48,424
<i>is a matter of simple trust,</i>
<i>an act of simple faith.</i>

972
00:54:48,998 --> 00:54:51,523
<i>Faith in you and in me.</i>

973
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:55,962
<i>Faith that we will supply them</i>
<i>with the funds necessary...</i>

974
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:58,302
<i>for carrying on their great work.</i>

975
00:54:58,975 --> 00:55:02,308
<i>And now the need for money</i>
<i>is greater than ever before.</i>

976
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:07,345
<i>I think we cannot do less</i>
<i>than justify this faith and confidence.</i>

977
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:11,253
<i>What else, indeed, are we fighting for?</i>

978
00:55:12,455 --> 00:55:13,513
<i>Thank you.</i>

979
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:21,127
<i>Thank you, Miss Marlowe.</i>

980
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:23,665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we urge you to send contributions...</i>

981
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:25,826
<i>to your local chapter</i>
<i>of the American Red Cross.</i>

982
00:55:25,901 --> 00:55:27,630
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

983
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:33,939
Excellent, Miss Marlowe,
and thank you again.

984
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,342
Not at all. I'm only too glad
to have been able to help.

985
00:55:36,412 --> 00:55:39,142
- Wonderful, Miss Marlowe.
- Very kind of you, Admiral.

986
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:41,080
Congratulations, Miss Marlowe.
You were splendid.

987
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,050
- Splendid talk, Miss Marlowe.
- Thank you, Commander.

988
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,314
Kit, I know you never like to hear it,
but you were wonderful.

989
00:55:45,388 --> 00:55:46,446
Oh, pooh.

990
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:48,615
- Tell me, have you seen Deirdre?
- No, I haven't.

991
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:50,886
- She's very naughty.
- Miss Marlowe.

992
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,393
- Yes.
- There's a call for you.

993
00:55:52,461 --> 00:55:54,429
- You may take it in the control room.
- Do you know who it is?

994
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:57,489
- No. I'm sorry.
- Oh. Excuse me, darling.

995
00:55:59,402 --> 00:56:00,733
Hello? Kit?

996
00:56:00,803 --> 00:56:02,464
Yes, this is Kit. Who is this?

997
00:56:02,538 --> 00:56:04,199
- Preston.
<i>- Who?</i>

998
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,340
Preston. Preston Drake.

999
00:56:06,609 --> 00:56:07,974
Preston Drake.

1000
00:56:08,677 --> 00:56:10,406
Well, I don't believe it.

1001
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:12,845
I just heard your broadcast,
and couldn't resist calling you.

1002
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,212
Kit, you were great.

1003
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:17,446
Well, thank you.
Where on earth did you spring from?

1004
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,852
I'm stationed in Washington these days,
in the Army.

1005
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,583
<i>Really? How wonderful.</i>

1006
00:56:21,657 --> 00:56:25,093
Say, Kit, what's the chance of seeing you?
Let's meet later on for a drink.

1007
00:56:25,161 --> 00:56:27,493
Well, I'd love it, Preston.

1008
00:56:27,696 --> 00:56:30,529
- Would you mind if I brought a beau along?
- Of course not.

1009
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:33,432
I'll tell you what, let's all meet
at the Garden Center in an hour.

1010
00:56:33,502 --> 00:56:37,199
Well, make it an hour and a half, will you?
I've got to get out of my uniform.

1011
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:38,740
An hour and a half?

1012
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:41,800
All right, 10:30 at the Garden Center.

1013
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:43,868
All right. Goodbye.

1014
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:52,515
That was Preston Drake, Rudd.
Deirdre's father.

1015
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:55,022
He asked us to join him
for a drink at the Garden Center...

1016
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:56,353
and I said we would.

1017
00:56:56,425 --> 00:56:58,325
- Do you mind?
- Do we have to?

1018
00:56:58,394 --> 00:57:01,022
Look, Kit, we haven't had an evening alone
since I can remember.

1019
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:03,497
I know, darling,
but there wasn't much I could do.

1020
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:06,364
He's a very old friend,
and I haven't seen him for years.

1021
00:57:06,435 --> 00:57:08,494
- All right.
- Tell you what you do.

1022
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:10,698
You drop me off at my apartment,
and I'll change...

1023
00:57:10,773 --> 00:57:12,400
and then you go on and pick up Deirdre.

1024
00:57:12,475 --> 00:57:14,875
She's probably at the Swing Club.
That's where Lucien plays.

1025
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:17,435
Look, I'm getting tired
of playing nursemaid to Deirdre.

1026
00:57:17,513 --> 00:57:19,777
Just this once. I want to surprise Preston.

1027
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:22,875
And if she refuses to come with you,
tell her I want to see her.

1028
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,966
- Good evening, <i>madame.</i>
- Oh, good evening.

1029
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,368
I'm looking for a Mr. Drake.

1030
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:45,498
- You mean Major Drake?
- Oh, that's right.

1031
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:47,735
- Right this way, please.
- Thank you.

1032
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:56,348
- Kit.
- Preston.

1033
00:57:58,254 --> 00:58:01,052
- Preston, it's not true.
- Well, well.

1034
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,288
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. So do you.

1035
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:07,823
Oh, I like that gray streak.
It's very attractive.

1036
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:10,092
Oh, it's a frightful giveaway.

1037
00:58:13,002 --> 00:58:14,196
Where's your beau?

1038
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,329
Oh, he was delayed.
He should be along in a minute.

1039
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:17,929
- Thank you.
- Fine.

1040
00:58:20,643 --> 00:58:23,578
- It's good to see you, Kit.
- It's good to see you.

1041
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:25,113
What'll you have to drink?

1042
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:28,673
Well, I think I'll have
a champagne cocktail.

1043
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:32,050
- They don't put you to sleep anymore?
- Oh, what a memory.

1044
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:33,281
Waiter.

1045
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,156
- How long have you been in the service?
- A couple of years.

1046
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,954
- A champagne cocktail.
- Yes, sir.

1047
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:41,185
We kept up with you for a while
and then we lost track of you.

1048
00:58:41,263 --> 00:58:42,525
Where on earth have you been?

1049
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:45,533
Oh, I drifted around Mexico
and South America, in various jobs.

1050
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:46,761
Oh, did you?

1051
00:58:46,835 --> 00:58:49,360
Tell me about Deedy.
How's she turned out?

1052
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:52,969
Well, I... I think you'll be proud of her.

1053
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:56,033
And Millie?
I suppose you two are still friends?

1054
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:58,375
- Oh, of course.
- How's she wearing?

1055
00:58:58,948 --> 00:59:03,385
Well, Millie was guaranteed for 80 years
when she was delivered.

1056
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:08,722
She eats, sleeps, and writes,
all three very heartily.

1057
00:59:09,592 --> 00:59:11,116
She has a home in Pelham...

1058
00:59:11,193 --> 00:59:14,094
but this winter
has taken an apartment in New York.

1059
00:59:14,463 --> 00:59:17,557
As a matter of fact,
your old rooms at the Chelton.

1060
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:22,934
Why don't you call her up, Preston?
I know she'd love to hear from you.

1061
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:25,064
- All right, I will.
- Good.

1062
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:28,401
But tell me more about you.

1063
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:34,174
Well, Kit, the last time I saw you,
you told me that life goes on. Remember?

1064
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:37,917
Yes, I do.

1065
00:59:37,987 --> 00:59:41,047
And I said, it was our only chance
for happiness.

1066
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:42,181
Yes.

1067
00:59:42,391 --> 00:59:44,188
And you said it wasn't true.

1068
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,663
- Well, you were right. I've found someone.
- I'm so happy for you, Preston.

1069
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,224
Thanks, Kit. I knew you would be.

1070
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,997
Kit, I am curious about this beau of yours.

1071
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,197
Is he something important in your life?

1072
00:59:58,574 --> 00:59:59,939
Yes, he is.

1073
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:03,009
- But there's a catch in it.
- Oh?

1074
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:06,806
A matter of years. Ten years, to be exact.

1075
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:09,316
- Older?
- No, younger.

1076
01:00:10,452 --> 01:00:13,387
You might know there'd be something.
Leave it to me.

1077
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:17,082
All right, come on.

1078
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:19,650
Listen, if this is a trick or a lie,
I'll never forgive you.

1079
01:00:19,728 --> 01:00:22,356
Look, I've got more to do than
play tricks on you. I'm doing this for Kit.

1080
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:25,127
- But what does she want me for?
- I told you you'd find out.

1081
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,760
I don't believe you.
Drive me back to the Swing Club.

1082
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:31,237
- Doll, come here, will you? Stop being...
- Let go of my hand. You hurt me.

1083
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:33,502
Oh, you're a tender little morsel,
aren't you? Now, come on.

1084
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:35,668
- Well, you don't have to push me around.
- Oh, shut up.

1085
01:00:35,744 --> 01:00:37,803
Why don't you relax for a change?

1086
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,576
You're gonna run yourself to a frazzle...

1087
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:42,708
then wonder later on
why you're old before your time.

1088
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:45,117
And to hear you, anyone would think
you were pleased about it.

1089
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:47,917
Look, I've told you a dozen times,
you don't mean a thing in my life.

1090
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,048
I'm doing this for Kit.

1091
01:00:49,124 --> 01:00:51,092
I don't know why
she should be so concerned about me.

1092
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,525
Neither do I, but she is.

1093
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:54,357
Look, why don't you get
some sense in your head?

1094
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:56,091
Don't you know
Lucien Grant's no good for you?

1095
01:00:56,165 --> 01:00:59,191
And what's more Kit doesn't like him,
and you ought to respect her judgment.

1096
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,735
- Who says I don't?
- I do.

1097
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:02,236
- Good evening, sir.
- Oh, hello.

1098
01:01:02,304 --> 01:01:04,101
We're joining Miss Marlowe and a friend.

1099
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:07,233
- Oh, yes. Right this way, please.
- Now behave yourself.

1100
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,344
- Hello, Kit.
- Oh, here you are.

1101
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:20,081
- Hello, Kit.
- Hello, Deedy.

1102
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,750
Deedy?

1103
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,224
Deedy, may I introduce you to your father?

1104
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:30,161
My father?

1105
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:36,964
Well, I...

1106
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,237
Darling, you might at least give him a kiss.
After all, he was the first love of your life.

1107
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:42,937
Deedy, come here.

1108
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:48,907
Preston, this is Rudd Kendall.
Mr. Kendall, Major Drake.

1109
01:01:48,984 --> 01:01:50,884
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1110
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:53,080
Darling, let's you and I have a dance.

1111
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:55,715
And let them say
all the sentimental things to each other...

1112
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:57,315
they've stored up for years.

1113
01:01:57,393 --> 01:01:59,452
Thank you, Kit. Deedy, sit down.

1114
01:02:03,866 --> 01:02:07,302
- Well, Deedy, 10 years is a long time.
- Yes, it is.

1115
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:10,065
Believe it or not, I used to take you
on my knee, put you to bed...

1116
01:02:10,139 --> 01:02:13,006
kiss you good night,
even give you your piggyback rides.

1117
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,069
I'll give you two pennies for your thoughts.

1118
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:20,275
- Not enough. Cost you a quarter.
- All right, I feel like splurging.

1119
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:23,042
Come on, Kit, tell me.
What are you thinking?

1120
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:25,780
- Oh, lots of things.
- About us, maybe?

1121
01:02:26,388 --> 01:02:28,948
- To tell you the truth, no.
- Oh.

1122
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:32,818
I was sort of hoping that maybe
you were thinking about my proposal.

1123
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:35,523
- What proposal?
- What proposal?

1124
01:02:35,597 --> 01:02:37,531
Remember, I'm the guy
that wants to marry you?

1125
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,160
- Oh, yes, of course. I'd forgotten.
- You'd forgotten, huh?

1126
01:02:41,804 --> 01:02:45,296
- You know, you're very encouraging.
- And you're very charming.

1127
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:48,305
This afternoon I was sweet,
tonight I'm charming...

1128
01:02:48,377 --> 01:02:50,208
and they both mean no, huh?

1129
01:03:01,356 --> 01:03:04,951
You said that every woman
has a ghost in her life.

1130
01:03:05,027 --> 01:03:07,860
Is the Major your ghost?

1131
01:03:08,464 --> 01:03:11,262
That, my dear, will cost you
more than a quarter.

1132
01:03:31,086 --> 01:03:32,314
Good morning.

1133
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:34,855
Good morning, Harriet.

1134
01:03:34,923 --> 01:03:37,721
It's 10:00. I thought maybe
you'd want to get up.

1135
01:03:38,794 --> 01:03:42,252
- I suppose maybe I should.
- How do you feel this morning?

1136
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:48,992
I feel very lonely and very old
this morning, Harriet.

1137
01:03:50,072 --> 01:03:54,406
- Do you ever feel that way?
- Not lonely, but kind of old sometimes.

1138
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,142
Your picture's in the paper.

1139
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:02,407
- Is it a good one?
- I don't like it.

1140
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:04,743
You're much better looking than that.

1141
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,015
Oh, thank you, Harriet.

1142
01:04:08,457 --> 01:04:12,188
I heard your speech last night, too.
It was just fine.

1143
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:14,985
You're such a little thing,
nobody'd think, to look at you...

1144
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:17,054
you had that much brains.

1145
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,293
I hope someday
to be able to figure you out, Harriet.

1146
01:04:20,702 --> 01:04:21,964
What for?

1147
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:26,201
There are times when you show signs
of genuine sentiment.

1148
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:31,007
- Is Miss Drake up yet?
- Not yet.

1149
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,011
But Mrs. Drake called up to say
she'd be a few minutes late for breakfast.

1150
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:38,951
That means she'll be twice as hungry.
What have we for breakfast?

1151
01:04:39,321 --> 01:04:42,188
Well, I managed to pick up
a little piece of liver.

1152
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,018
You can give that to Mrs. Drake.

1153
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:46,754
Well, you could do
with a few vitamins yourself.

1154
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:49,592
I loathe vitamins, except eggs.

1155
01:04:50,332 --> 01:04:52,698
One, lightly boiled, would be heavenly.

1156
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:57,662
- By the way, how is the egg situation?
- I could only get pullet eggs.

1157
01:04:58,373 --> 01:05:00,500
Well, I suppose
we should be grateful for that.

1158
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:04,034
When Miss Drake wakes up,
tell her to come up if she wants to.

1159
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:06,740
Are we running a hotel
for the Drake family?

1160
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,814
Well, it would seem that way,
wouldn't it, Harriet?

1161
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:14,020
If there was no system,
there'd be no point having any.

1162
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,800
- Well!
- Good morning, Harriet.

1163
01:05:26,868 --> 01:05:28,096
Oh, good morning.

1164
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,698
- Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

1165
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:31,295
- Is she awake?
- Having her coffee.

1166
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:32,965
- Good.
- Well, what's all the rush about?

1167
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,702
Tell you later. Oh.

1168
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:37,506
Better knock on the door.

1169
01:05:39,548 --> 01:05:40,776
Come in.

1170
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,818
- Good morning, darling.
- Rudd. So early.

1171
01:05:43,885 --> 01:05:45,819
Yeah, I just had to see you.
Take a look, darling.

1172
01:05:45,887 --> 01:05:47,650
It's my commission,
just arrived from Washington.

1173
01:05:47,723 --> 01:05:48,815
See, I leave in five days.

1174
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,858
- What about some coffee?
- No, thanks.

1175
01:05:50,926 --> 01:05:53,156
Kit, marry me, will you? This morning.

1176
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:55,822
- Rudd, this is so sudden.
- Well, these are sudden times.

1177
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:57,728
- Well, I know that, but...
- Will you, please?

1178
01:05:57,799 --> 01:05:59,494
- Rudd, I...
- I can't take you out to sea...

1179
01:05:59,568 --> 01:06:02,332
and keep asking you every day,
I couldn't keep my mind on my work.

1180
01:06:03,538 --> 01:06:06,632
Rudd. Let me get my breath.

1181
01:06:06,942 --> 01:06:08,967
All you've got to do is make up your mind.

1182
01:06:09,044 --> 01:06:11,774
- Well...
- Now, don't start analyzing again.

1183
01:06:12,147 --> 01:06:15,742
Rudd, I'm not any younger
than I was yesterday when you asked me.

1184
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:17,876
Oh, Kit, please, let's not go into that again.

1185
01:06:17,953 --> 01:06:20,319
But that is the important part of it.

1186
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:27,154
I've thought a lot about this
since yesterday.

1187
01:06:27,963 --> 01:06:29,828
Rudd, come here, sit down.

1188
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:33,526
You should marry some young girl.

1189
01:06:34,302 --> 01:06:36,770
Someone with whom
you can have children.

1190
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:38,635
Someone with whom you can settle down.

1191
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,403
I'm not gonna marry some sappy girl,
and raise a bunch of sappy kids.

1192
01:06:41,476 --> 01:06:44,206
- That isn't what I want, Kit. I want you.
- Rudd.

1193
01:06:44,513 --> 01:06:47,676
Rudd, listen to me calmly
for just a minute.

1194
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:53,011
You're leaving in five days,
and heaven knows when you'll be back.

1195
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:55,753
But when this war is over...

1196
01:06:56,324 --> 01:07:00,351
let's hope there'll be a wonderful world
waiting for young men like you...

1197
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:05,332
to take hold of, and make happy lives
for yourselves and everyone else.

1198
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:10,094
And that does not make sense
with a woman 10 years older than you are.

1199
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,567
Perhaps it wouldn't make
so much difference now...

1200
01:07:13,642 --> 01:07:15,200
but think of 10 years from now.

1201
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:17,404
Kit, no matter what you say,
I know what I want.

1202
01:07:17,479 --> 01:07:19,242
I want to marry you.

1203
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:26,752
Rudd, you make it so difficult for me.

1204
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:31,054
No, Kit. You make it difficult for yourself.

1205
01:07:40,402 --> 01:07:41,562
Hello.

1206
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,329
Yes.

1207
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:45,572
Oh, put him on.

1208
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,473
It's Mr. Mallory.

1209
01:07:48,877 --> 01:07:50,606
Good morning, Mr. Mallory.

1210
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,277
I meant to call you. I'm sorry.

1211
01:07:53,348 --> 01:07:55,407
Kit, ask him to call back later.

1212
01:07:55,851 --> 01:07:59,014
Mr. Mallory, would you hold on
for just a minute, please?

1213
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:03,349
Rudd, give me a few days
to think this over by myself...

1214
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,784
without your distracting presence.

1215
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:08,295
- So, I'm distracting, huh?
- Very, I find.

1216
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:10,388
At least that's something.

1217
01:08:11,266 --> 01:08:12,631
Yes, Mr. Mallory.

1218
01:08:13,869 --> 01:08:16,929
Well, I'll try to get it to you
by the end of the week.

1219
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:18,606
Yes, I think I can.

1220
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:23,933
Mr. Mallory, would you hold on
for just one more moment, please?

1221
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:27,448
Rudd, don't act like this.
I'm only thinking of you.

1222
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:31,851
Darling, call me in few days.

1223
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:34,615
I promise to give you my answer
before you go.

1224
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:37,586
All right, Kit, if that's the way you want it.

1225
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:49,136
Oh. Oh, Mr. Mallory,
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting.

1226
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:05,619
Good morning.

1227
01:09:06,454 --> 01:09:07,580
Hello.

1228
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:10,856
Well, you look like I feel.

1229
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:13,691
- Anything wrong?
- No, no.

1230
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,960
I suppose I ought to apologize
about last night.

1231
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:21,596
If you had told me
I was going to meet my father...

1232
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,070
I wouldn't have caused you
so much trouble.

1233
01:09:24,139 --> 01:09:26,369
Oh, it's all right. Forget it.

1234
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:33,581
- Where are you going?
- Oh, no place in particular.

1235
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:35,673
I'm going for a walk.

1236
01:09:35,984 --> 01:09:38,316
Harriet says, a nice long walk
is good for a mood.

1237
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,014
- Yeah?
- Would you like to come along?

1238
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:43,724
- Might be good for you, too.
- Sure, why not?

1239
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:45,726
Good. Harriet.

1240
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:47,820
Yes.

1241
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:49,261
I'm going now.

1242
01:09:49,331 --> 01:09:51,322
Tell Mother I'll see her
at the apartment later.

1243
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,367
- All right.
- Thanks.

1244
01:09:53,435 --> 01:09:54,663
Goodbye.

1245
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:56,429
Bye.

1246
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:06,712
- Harriet, is Miss Drake up yet?
- Yes.

1247
01:10:06,781 --> 01:10:09,978
She went out for a walk.
Mr. Kendall went with her.

1248
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:11,075
Oh.

1249
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,412
Good.

1250
01:10:14,389 --> 01:10:17,756
Harriet, our nice Mr. Kendall
is leaving us in a few days.

1251
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,320
- He's going into the Navy.
- Well, that's fine.

1252
01:10:21,663 --> 01:10:24,632
Now you'll get some rest
and you certainly need it.

1253
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:28,128
Should I marry him?

1254
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:32,938
- Harriet.
- Yes, ma'am.

1255
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,508
Should I marry him?

1256
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,405
Did he ask you?

1257
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:45,447
Well, I certainly didn't ask him.

1258
01:10:47,389 --> 01:10:50,153
Well, if he asked me, I certainly would.

1259
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:53,022
- Oh, you would?
- Yes, I would.

1260
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:13,069
- These are all rumbas.
- Oh, thank you.

1261
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:16,541
- I think I'll take these and these I have.
- Very good.

1262
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:20,883
A rumba or two
might liven up the apartment.

1263
01:11:20,956 --> 01:11:23,823
It might be good for Mother
to learn to rumba.

1264
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:25,324
I need a fresh needle.

1265
01:11:25,393 --> 01:11:27,884
You know, there's a war on.
Uncle Sam needs needles.

1266
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:30,488
- You do think of things, don't you?
- Oh, sure I do.

1267
01:11:30,565 --> 01:11:32,556
I'm terrific. Haven't you heard?

1268
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:36,196
I really think you think you are.

1269
01:11:43,578 --> 01:11:46,604
- Come on, let's dance.
- No, no. No, I had too much lunch.

1270
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:48,478
- It's good for the lunch. Please come on.
- No.

1271
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,018
- Rudd.
- But I don't feel like dancing.

1272
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,116
Look.

1273
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:58,089
Where you grabbed me last night.

1274
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,320
- Well, you had it coming to you.
- I did not!

1275
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:03,722
Hey, take it easy, will you?
You're giving me the jitters.

1276
01:12:03,798 --> 01:12:05,425
Can't you sit down
and listen to the music?

1277
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,469
- No, I like to dance.
- Oh, sit down, will you?

1278
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:11,603
Every time I feel like laughing...

1279
01:12:11,673 --> 01:12:13,436
or behaving like
any normal human being...

1280
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:14,634
someone comes along and says...

1281
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:17,610
"Don't feel like that,"
or, "Sit down," or, "Be quiet."

1282
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:21,806
Hey, you are in a bad way.

1283
01:12:24,986 --> 01:12:26,078
Here.

1284
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:29,280
What's the matter with you, anyway?

1285
01:12:29,357 --> 01:12:31,723
Oh, don't mind me. I'm just all mixed up.

1286
01:12:31,793 --> 01:12:34,057
- Yeah, you are a little nuts.
- Thanks.

1287
01:12:34,529 --> 01:12:37,225
- But you got a very odd sort of attraction.
- Really?

1288
01:12:37,298 --> 01:12:39,789
What you'll grow up into, I don't know.

1289
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:42,063
I don't think I'll grow up into anything.

1290
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:44,367
You know the old proverbial ship
without a rudder?

1291
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:46,134
Well, I think I was born without a rudder.

1292
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:47,799
You mean, you're at the disposal
of the weather?

1293
01:12:47,876 --> 01:12:50,572
Yeah, that's it. Sums me up completely.

1294
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,180
Well, I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
I was a little sore about something.

1295
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:59,649
- I shouldn't have taken it out on you.
- It doesn't matter.

1296
01:13:00,989 --> 01:13:04,481
Oh, I wish I were 30.
Then I wouldn't have any problems.

1297
01:13:04,559 --> 01:13:05,821
That's what you think.

1298
01:13:05,894 --> 01:13:07,555
Well, at least you know
what you want, by then.

1299
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,119
No, I'm not so sure.

1300
01:13:10,065 --> 01:13:13,000
You don't mean to say it's going to go on
being as bad as this always?

1301
01:13:13,068 --> 01:13:15,798
- Well, I don't know how bad this is.
- It's bad enough.

1302
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:20,267
Hey, look, you're not thinking
of doing anything drastic, are you?

1303
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,706
- Supposing I am?
- Well, don't.

1304
01:13:22,777 --> 01:13:24,506
You're not in love with Lucien Grant.

1305
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:26,809
- How do you know?
- Well, you're not, are you?

1306
01:13:26,881 --> 01:13:29,509
- Well...
- Come on, come on, tell me the truth.

1307
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,651
No. It doesn't feel the way
I thought being in love would feel like.

1308
01:13:35,723 --> 01:13:38,248
Then you wait until it does feel like that.

1309
01:13:39,594 --> 01:13:41,425
Why are you telling me this?

1310
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:44,689
Well, I don't want to see you get hurt.

1311
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:50,632
You know, it's funny,
but quite suddenly I can talk to you.

1312
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:54,838
Last night you were so angry,
but now you've changed.

1313
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,343
Maybe you had something to do with that.

1314
01:13:57,846 --> 01:13:59,143
Thank you.

1315
01:14:00,348 --> 01:14:02,578
- Why is it that...
- Why is what?

1316
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,952
Oh, I don't know.

1317
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,583
Just now, you said I was nuts.

1318
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:10,590
Well, there are certain things you can't be
immediately articulate about.

1319
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:12,421
What are you trying to say?

1320
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:16,328
Well, quite suddenly
I seem to be able to talk to you.

1321
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:18,256
You've changed.

1322
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,961
Well, maybe you had something
to do with that.

1323
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:25,172
You're very charming, Deirdre.

1324
01:14:26,774 --> 01:14:29,470
Are you contemplating
making love to me?

1325
01:14:29,544 --> 01:14:31,739
Is there any reason why I shouldn't?

1326
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:33,906
No.

1327
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:36,874
Hello. Hello.

1328
01:14:37,152 --> 01:14:39,450
Oh, hello. This is Mrs. Drake.

1329
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:41,682
I'm expecting Mr. Drake in a few minutes.

1330
01:14:41,756 --> 01:14:44,316
As soon as he arrives,
will you send him right up?

1331
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:46,019
Thank you so much.

1332
01:15:23,164 --> 01:15:24,426
Come in!

1333
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:29,459
Hello, Millie.

1334
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:31,638
Oh, it's you.

1335
01:15:31,806 --> 01:15:34,297
Who did you think I was going to be?

1336
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:37,670
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm expecting someone.

1337
01:15:37,745 --> 01:15:40,805
- Oh, then perhaps I'm intruding.
- Oh, no, not at all.

1338
01:15:41,115 --> 01:15:43,811
- Millie, your apartment looks very nice.
- Thanks.

1339
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:46,752
You might be interested to know
who I'm expecting.

1340
01:15:47,388 --> 01:15:49,413
- Yes, who?
- Preston.

1341
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:52,749
- That explains the music, then.
- Yes.

1342
01:15:52,827 --> 01:15:55,625
He telephoned this morning
and he said he wanted to talk to me.

1343
01:15:55,697 --> 01:15:59,030
- And he was extremely pleasant.
- That's wonderful.

1344
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,900
Kit, why should he suddenly want
to see me, after all these years?

1345
01:16:02,971 --> 01:16:04,131
Well, I don't know.

1346
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:06,503
I should think perhaps
he wants to talk to you about Deirdre.

1347
01:16:06,574 --> 01:16:08,667
I think it's something else.

1348
01:16:08,743 --> 01:16:11,371
Kit, do you think I should take him back?

1349
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:12,504
What?

1350
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,481
I said, do you think
I should take him back?

1351
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:18,780
But, Millie, surely Preston has told you
that he's engaged?

1352
01:16:18,853 --> 01:16:22,983
Oh, yes, but that doesn't mean anything.
He's probably lonely, just like I am.

1353
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,951
Well, Millie, far be it from me
to disappoint you...

1354
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:30,896
but I believe
he's very much in love with this girl.

1355
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:34,731
But what have they in common?
After all, we were together for so long.

1356
01:16:35,436 --> 01:16:37,529
It's a great satisfaction to know
that in the end...

1357
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:39,800
a man does turn back to his wife.

1358
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:43,400
Well, Millie...

1359
01:16:43,911 --> 01:16:47,005
I wouldn't count on it, if I were you.

1360
01:16:47,181 --> 01:16:51,083
Oh, you couldn't understand.
I know Preston. I was married to him.

1361
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:54,278
Just the sound of his voice today.

1362
01:16:54,422 --> 01:16:56,481
Kit, I want something more out of life...

1363
01:16:56,557 --> 01:16:58,684
than just books
and a discontented daughter.

1364
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,126
We aren't getting any younger, you know.

1365
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:03,755
Yes, Millie, I'm quite aware of that.

1366
01:17:04,832 --> 01:17:09,462
Millie, what would you say if I told you
I thought I might be going to get married?

1367
01:17:09,871 --> 01:17:12,203
Who to? Not that young Kendall?

1368
01:17:12,473 --> 01:17:14,805
Yes. Do you think I'd be crazy?

1369
01:17:16,044 --> 01:17:18,706
I should have thought
you could have done better for yourself.

1370
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,647
- That's not the point.
- Well, what is, then?

1371
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:23,944
The point is, I'm in love with him.

1372
01:17:24,552 --> 01:17:28,044
I didn't see him all day yesterday,
or the day before, and I...

1373
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:31,319
I find I miss him. Miss him terribly.

1374
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:35,122
Well, it's all very romantic.

1375
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:37,998
But what would he be like as a husband?

1376
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:40,965
He'd be devoted and enchanting...

1377
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:43,236
while it lasted.

1378
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,532
But you think he's too young for me,
don't you?

1379
01:17:48,776 --> 01:17:51,574
And you think I'd really be crazy
to marry him.

1380
01:17:51,646 --> 01:17:53,671
Yes, I think I do, really.

1381
01:17:53,948 --> 01:17:56,974
So do I. But I'm going to, all the same.

1382
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:03,013
Goodness, I didn't realize
how late it was getting.

1383
01:18:03,091 --> 01:18:06,060
I have an appointment with Mallory
to pick up my galleys.

1384
01:18:06,127 --> 01:18:07,788
- Bye, darling.
- Goodbye.

1385
01:18:07,862 --> 01:18:09,352
Look, stop in on your way back.

1386
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,330
I may have
some very interesting news for you.

1387
01:18:11,399 --> 01:18:12,491
I will if I can.

1388
01:18:12,567 --> 01:18:15,331
I'll see if I can get an extra set
of my galleys and leave them by for you.

1389
01:18:15,403 --> 01:18:16,461
Good.

1390
01:18:16,537 --> 01:18:19,165
- Millie, you look very pretty today.
- Same to you, dear.

1391
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,765
Oh, isn't it marvelous
what it does for one?

1392
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:24,244
- Goodbye, darling.
- Bye.

1393
01:18:31,452 --> 01:18:32,851
- Hello, Deedy.
- Hello, Kit.

1394
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,478
- Is Mother in?
- Yes.

1395
01:18:34,555 --> 01:18:36,147
What's more, she's expecting someone.

1396
01:18:36,224 --> 01:18:39,716
- Who?
- Well, as a matter of fact, it's your father.

1397
01:18:39,794 --> 01:18:42,786
- You don't tell me.
- Yes. Hear the Brahms?

1398
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,799
Deedy, you're looking very gay today.

1399
01:18:46,868 --> 01:18:49,564
Thanks, darling, I feel gay. So do you.

1400
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:51,195
Thank you. Goodbye, darling.

1401
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,297
- Bye. See you later.
- Yes.

1402
01:19:01,549 --> 01:19:02,573
Oh.

1403
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,117
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.

1404
01:19:04,185 --> 01:19:06,346
- I hear we're going to have a visitor.
- Yes.

1405
01:19:06,421 --> 01:19:07,911
And when I'm worried about you...

1406
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:10,480
when I want to know where you are
you're strangely absent.

1407
01:19:10,558 --> 01:19:13,493
Now, this is one time I could do
without you and here you are.

1408
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,825
All right, I'll go. I can take a hint.

1409
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:17,831
- I like your hat.
- Thanks.

1410
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:20,031
Give my love to Father.

1411
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:24,561
By the way, how did you ever let anyone
as nice as that get away from you?

1412
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:37,014
Coming!

1413
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:43,179
- Hello. Come on in.
- Hello, Millie.

1414
01:19:43,391 --> 01:19:45,723
My, how handsome we look
in our new uniform.

1415
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:46,987
Thanks.

1416
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,852
- Here, let me take your things.
- Thank you.

1417
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:56,030
Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it?

1418
01:19:56,103 --> 01:19:57,502
Yes, it has.

1419
01:19:57,605 --> 01:19:59,903
- Oh, won't you sit down?
- Thanks.

1420
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:03,002
- Same old rooms.
- Yes, the same old rooms.

1421
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:05,545
- Looks nice.
- I'm glad you like it.

1422
01:20:06,147 --> 01:20:08,115
- Can I make you a drink?
- I'd love one.

1423
01:20:08,182 --> 01:20:09,274
Good.

1424
01:20:10,618 --> 01:20:13,052
- Any Scotch?
- Of course, silly.

1425
01:20:13,454 --> 01:20:15,183
Your special brand.

1426
01:20:15,456 --> 01:20:16,855
That's fine.

1427
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:22,996
- Where's Deedy?
- Oh, she isn't here.

1428
01:20:23,064 --> 01:20:25,294
I can see that. Will she be in?

1429
01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:27,857
Well, she may come in later.

1430
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,362
- There. Here you are.
- Thanks.

1431
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:34,336
You're looking well, Millie.

1432
01:20:34,408 --> 01:20:36,103
- Do you think so?
- Very well.

1433
01:20:36,177 --> 01:20:38,111
Oh, it's just vitamins.

1434
01:20:38,846 --> 01:20:41,576
- Here, will you have a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

1435
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:42,741
All right.

1436
01:20:42,817 --> 01:20:45,081
- Here's looking at you.
- Thank you.

1437
01:20:46,821 --> 01:20:50,120
Well, Millie, I suppose you're wondering
why I've come to see you.

1438
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,323
I think I can guess.

1439
01:20:52,393 --> 01:20:53,724
- Yes?
- Yes.

1440
01:20:53,794 --> 01:20:55,989
You see, I know a great deal
about men, Preston.

1441
01:20:56,063 --> 01:20:59,931
Especially when they're behaving
according to their finer instincts.

1442
01:21:00,101 --> 01:21:02,365
Oh. Yes. Yes, of course.

1443
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:06,471
Millie, now that I'm getting married,
I'll have a home...

1444
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,738
and I thought perhaps you might
be willing to share Deedy with me.

1445
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:12,870
I know that Laurel's a bit young to be
a stepmother, in the ordinary sense...

1446
01:21:12,947 --> 01:21:16,383
but I see no reason why she and Deedy
shouldn't be very good friends.

1447
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:18,281
Oh, no, of course not.

1448
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:20,684
- That's what you wanted to see me about?
- That's right.

1449
01:21:20,755 --> 01:21:22,518
Why, yes, of course.

1450
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:25,125
Well, Preston...

1451
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:28,654
how long have you known this young girl?

1452
01:21:29,063 --> 01:21:31,293
A year or two. Why do you ask that?

1453
01:21:31,365 --> 01:21:33,731
Well, naturally, I'm concerned about you.

1454
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:37,464
After all, we were together for so long
and we had a child and...

1455
01:21:37,538 --> 01:21:39,369
Well, you just disappeared into the blue.

1456
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,135
- Not a word.
- I know.

1457
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:44,041
- People have feelings, Preston.
- That's true.

1458
01:21:44,111 --> 01:21:46,375
But I thought it best
to make a clean break.

1459
01:21:46,447 --> 01:21:48,881
I'm rather one of the old,
sentimental sort...

1460
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:52,147
and I knew if I saw Deedy again,
it might upset the apple cart.

1461
01:21:52,219 --> 01:21:54,449
So I decided
to put her clean out of my mind.

1462
01:21:54,522 --> 01:21:56,922
All of you. Kit, too.

1463
01:21:57,992 --> 01:21:59,050
Kit?

1464
01:22:00,328 --> 01:22:01,590
Yes, Kit.

1465
01:22:01,729 --> 01:22:04,425
Why... Well, what had Kit to do with it?

1466
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:09,235
Well, I really don't see
why I shouldn't tell you about it now.

1467
01:22:09,403 --> 01:22:12,099
Millie, I was in love with Kit.

1468
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:16,141
- In love with her?
- Yes.

1469
01:22:18,012 --> 01:22:19,479
When was that?

1470
01:22:19,547 --> 01:22:21,913
Oh, it began a year or two
before we separated.

1471
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:24,110
Did you ever tell her that you loved her?

1472
01:22:24,185 --> 01:22:25,948
I did. Many times.

1473
01:22:26,354 --> 01:22:29,016
- And while you were married to me?
- Yes.

1474
01:22:29,323 --> 01:22:31,382
Oh, the snake in the grass!

1475
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,757
And all the time pretending
she was my best friend.

1476
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:35,887
But she was. She still is.

1477
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,693
She's been a better friend to you
than you've ever realized.

1478
01:22:38,766 --> 01:22:40,996
I'd be married to Kit now
if it hadn't been for you.

1479
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:44,333
I was desperately in love with her
and I think she felt the same toward me.

1480
01:22:44,405 --> 01:22:46,066
- Did she tell you so?
- Yes.

1481
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,370
She'd have married me
but you were the reason she didn't.

1482
01:22:48,442 --> 01:22:51,343
Her best friend. She said
that's something you just don't do.

1483
01:22:51,412 --> 01:22:53,380
I don't believe it.
I don't believe a word of it.

1484
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,472
- You're just making this up.
- I'm not.

1485
01:22:55,549 --> 01:22:57,710
Oh, Millie, you can't mind about this now.

1486
01:22:57,785 --> 01:22:59,309
- What happened between you?
- Nothing.

1487
01:22:59,387 --> 01:23:01,617
Oh, don't let's go into it.
It's over and done with.

1488
01:23:01,689 --> 01:23:04,055
We certainly will go into it.
I want to know what happened.

1489
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:07,117
Nothing at all. She kissed me goodbye
and sent me away.

1490
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:08,991
- Oh, she sent you away.
- Yes, she did!

1491
01:23:09,063 --> 01:23:11,793
- You're just trying to protect her!
- Millie.

1492
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,325
Preston, I'd like you to go, please.

1493
01:23:15,403 --> 01:23:17,701
I'm very glad to know
what you've just told me...

1494
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:19,637
but I'd like you to go.

1495
01:23:21,642 --> 01:23:24,941
I must say, Millie,
you're as unpredictable as ever.

1496
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:33,186
I'm terribly sorry this has happened.
I really didn't mean to upset you.

1497
01:23:36,957 --> 01:23:38,185
Goodbye.

1498
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:56,376
Mother, what's happened?

1499
01:23:56,477 --> 01:23:58,377
You do let yourself go.

1500
01:23:58,713 --> 01:23:59,975
You asked me a while ago...

1501
01:24:00,047 --> 01:24:02,515
how I happened to let anything
like your father get away from me.

1502
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:05,051
Well, I'll tell you.
He was taken away from me. Filched.

1503
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:06,677
- Filched?
- Oh, well, stolen, then.

1504
01:24:06,754 --> 01:24:07,880
And who by, do you think?

1505
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:11,447
By the woman I thought
was my best friend, your sainted Kit.

1506
01:24:11,525 --> 01:24:13,186
Mother, have you gone quite mad?

1507
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:16,525
All these years I've asked myself
what I'd done to drive him away from me.

1508
01:24:16,597 --> 01:24:17,928
I've searched my conduct.

1509
01:24:17,998 --> 01:24:20,865
And all the while
the truth was lurking in the shadows.

1510
01:24:20,935 --> 01:24:23,165
It was that Judas
that calls herself my friend.

1511
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:25,967
Look, Mother, this isn't one of your books.
This is real life.

1512
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,803
You're talking about Father and Kit.

1513
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:29,172
I know who I'm talking about.

1514
01:24:29,243 --> 01:24:31,507
Your father's just confessed
the whole thing.

1515
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:34,139
Oh, that she would have the nerve
to criticize me...

1516
01:24:34,215 --> 01:24:35,648
for the way I was treating him.

1517
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:38,150
Why... Why, it was in this very room.

1518
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:39,743
I was sitting there on the couch...

1519
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,845
and she was standing back here,
by the piano...

1520
01:24:41,922 --> 01:24:44,618
when she accused me
of making your father's life miserable.

1521
01:24:44,692 --> 01:24:47,183
No. No, she walked away from the piano...

1522
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:50,059
and she stood right over me
and told me that.

1523
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:54,124
And all the while she was carrying on
with him like some Jezebel.

1524
01:24:54,368 --> 01:24:55,460
Well.

1525
01:24:55,703 --> 01:25:00,231
Well, I can wish her no worse fate
than that for which she is heading now.

1526
01:25:01,776 --> 01:25:03,471
What do you mean by that?

1527
01:25:03,544 --> 01:25:06,012
Oh, she's embarking
on a little cradle-snatching.

1528
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,207
That silly young boy
she's been carrying on with...

1529
01:25:08,282 --> 01:25:09,715
has been called into the Navy.

1530
01:25:09,784 --> 01:25:13,982
And she must immediately become
a young sailor's bride of 42.

1531
01:25:14,355 --> 01:25:16,346
Who are you talking about?

1532
01:25:17,358 --> 01:25:19,883
- Mother, you can't mean Rudd?
- Who else?

1533
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:23,054
She was here just a few minutes ago
driveling about marrying him.

1534
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,825
I think she sees herself at the point...

1535
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:26,924
where she can't be
so sure of men anymore...

1536
01:25:27,001 --> 01:25:28,901
whether they're
other women's husbands, or not.

1537
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:30,869
- Are you sure of this?
- Yes.

1538
01:25:31,005 --> 01:25:34,532
Apparently Rudd is still infatuated
and anxious for marriage...

1539
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:37,168
in spite of the closeness
of their relationship.

1540
01:25:37,244 --> 01:25:40,941
- Just what do you mean by that?
- Just what you think I mean.

1541
01:25:42,449 --> 01:25:43,609
Well...

1542
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:46,877
this is quite a surprise.

1543
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:49,486
Oh, the longer you know Kit...

1544
01:25:49,557 --> 01:25:52,492
the more you'll find
she's full of hidden surprises.

1545
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,927
- Mother, are you telling me the truth?
- Of course. Why should I lie?

1546
01:25:55,996 --> 01:25:58,487
Why, it's time you knew
what was going on around you.

1547
01:25:58,566 --> 01:26:01,797
It's time you came out
of your illusions about Kit.

1548
01:26:01,869 --> 01:26:05,361
I think it's about time
I came out of a lot of illusions.

1549
01:26:07,741 --> 01:26:09,709
Why... Why, Deirdre.

1550
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:13,805
Well.

1551
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,481
Thank you.

1552
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:22,882
- Hello, Kit.
- Hello.

1553
01:26:22,957 --> 01:26:24,788
I'm sorry, I have to rush.

1554
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:27,293
- Congratulations.
- What about?

1555
01:26:28,462 --> 01:26:32,057
You and Rudd. I'm so glad.
Heaps of love to you both.

1556
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:36,559
- Deedy, where are you off to?
- I have a date, with Lucien.

1557
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:53,714
Come in.

1558
01:26:57,424 --> 01:26:59,289
- Hello, Millie.
- Hello.

1559
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:02,825
What's been going on?

1560
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:06,355
I just ran into Deirdre in the hall
and she was almost hysterical.

1561
01:27:06,433 --> 01:27:08,526
I don't know what you mean.

1562
01:27:11,672 --> 01:27:12,866
Millie...

1563
01:27:13,874 --> 01:27:16,604
what did you tell Deirdre
about Rudd and me?

1564
01:27:17,244 --> 01:27:19,804
I told her that you were
going to be married. Why?

1565
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,507
What did you tell her that for?

1566
01:27:21,582 --> 01:27:23,413
Since I haven't even told him myself yet...

1567
01:27:23,484 --> 01:27:25,748
I should have thought
it was a little premature.

1568
01:27:26,086 --> 01:27:29,522
But that certainly couldn't have upset her.
It must have been something else.

1569
01:27:30,124 --> 01:27:31,148
What was it?

1570
01:27:31,225 --> 01:27:33,989
You set yourself up
as a paragon of virtue to that girl...

1571
01:27:34,061 --> 01:27:37,030
and it was my duty, as her mother,
to open her eyes.

1572
01:27:37,598 --> 01:27:39,759
So that's what you told her.

1573
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:42,695
Millie, why did you do that?
Why should you?

1574
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:45,466
Why shouldn't I?
Haven't you done enough to me?

1575
01:27:45,539 --> 01:27:47,029
What have I done to you?

1576
01:27:47,107 --> 01:27:49,905
- Don't you remember?
- Remember what?

1577
01:27:50,344 --> 01:27:53,677
You, my so-called best friend
and Preston, my husband.

1578
01:27:53,747 --> 01:27:55,772
Surely you remember that?

1579
01:27:57,618 --> 01:27:59,210
I do, distinctly.

1580
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,983
Then you don't pretend that you've
forgotten taking him away from me?

1581
01:28:03,057 --> 01:28:04,718
Millie, where did you hear such nonsense?

1582
01:28:04,792 --> 01:28:07,625
Never mind. You didn't think
I'd ever find out, did you?

1583
01:28:08,128 --> 01:28:10,323
There's nothing to find out, Millie.

1584
01:28:10,397 --> 01:28:12,365
Don't try to squirm out of it.

1585
01:28:12,433 --> 01:28:15,425
Why, there hasn't been a man yet
you haven't carried on with...

1586
01:28:15,502 --> 01:28:16,833
if you've had half a chance.

1587
01:28:16,904 --> 01:28:19,805
- Millie, have you gone stark staring mad?
- No.

1588
01:28:19,873 --> 01:28:21,431
You took my life and broke it.

1589
01:28:21,508 --> 01:28:24,568
You were at the bottom
of this whole thing and I hate you for it.

1590
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:27,944
Millie, if that weren't so stupid,
it would be funny.

1591
01:28:28,048 --> 01:28:31,211
You don't really believe these things,
I know you don't.

1592
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:33,480
How could I have been so blind?

1593
01:28:33,854 --> 01:28:36,982
You've coveted everything
that I've ever had, always.

1594
01:28:37,091 --> 01:28:40,117
All right, Millie.
You've been asking for this for years.

1595
01:28:40,728 --> 01:28:44,789
I'm going to have to tell you something
that I hoped I'd never have to tell you.

1596
01:28:44,865 --> 01:28:47,163
You don't care at all
about having lost Preston.

1597
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:48,963
If it had been any other woman...

1598
01:28:49,036 --> 01:28:51,231
you never would have given it
a second's thought.

1599
01:28:51,305 --> 01:28:54,763
You only cared because it was me,
because you're jealous of me.

1600
01:28:54,842 --> 01:28:56,867
You've always been jealous of me.

1601
01:28:56,944 --> 01:29:00,846
You've been jealous of my career,
of the kind of life that I lead.

1602
01:29:00,914 --> 01:29:03,542
You're even jealous
of Deirdre's affection for me.

1603
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:06,711
That's why you told her
about Rudd and me today.

1604
01:29:06,787 --> 01:29:09,347
Millie, you've done some
pretty bad things in your life...

1605
01:29:09,423 --> 01:29:11,084
but this is the worst yet.

1606
01:29:11,158 --> 01:29:13,422
Even if you didn't care
how much you hurt me...

1607
01:29:13,494 --> 01:29:15,189
you might at least have given a thought...

1608
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:19,096
to what it would mean to Deirdre
to have her faith in me shaken.

1609
01:29:20,667 --> 01:29:24,433
I'd better get out of here, Millie,
before I do something I'll be very sorry for.

1610
01:29:25,172 --> 01:29:26,571
Yes, go! Go!

1611
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,098
And if you think I want you
to come back again, ever, you're wrong!

1612
01:29:30,177 --> 01:29:32,372
You need have no worries on that score.

1613
01:29:32,446 --> 01:29:35,438
And as you've taken everything else
I've ever cared for in my life...

1614
01:29:35,516 --> 01:29:38,849
you might as well take Deirdre, too,
since she's so fond of you.

1615
01:29:38,986 --> 01:29:41,853
And don't think I couldn't have,
many times.

1616
01:29:42,523 --> 01:29:45,720
All right, go ahead and leave me alone,
all of you.

1617
01:29:45,793 --> 01:29:47,920
But you can't take my work
away from me.

1618
01:29:47,995 --> 01:29:50,190
That, at least, is inviolate.

1619
01:29:57,838 --> 01:29:59,703
Well, why don't you go?

1620
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:02,034
In just a minute.

1621
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:19,719
Sorry.

1622
01:30:35,876 --> 01:30:38,174
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1623
01:30:39,346 --> 01:30:40,506
Hello.

1624
01:30:41,081 --> 01:30:42,708
Yes, Major Drake.

1625
01:30:43,317 --> 01:30:46,980
Well, she's not here right now
but I expect her any minute.

1626
01:30:47,154 --> 01:30:48,416
Yes, sir.

1627
01:30:48,822 --> 01:30:50,084
Yes, sir.

1628
01:30:50,624 --> 01:30:53,024
I'll tell her as soon as she arrives.

1629
01:30:53,093 --> 01:30:54,788
All right. Goodbye.

1630
01:30:55,796 --> 01:30:58,094
- Well, at last.
- Hello, Harriet.

1631
01:30:58,465 --> 01:31:01,093
- Was that Mr. Kendall?
- No, it was Major Drake.

1632
01:31:01,168 --> 01:31:02,635
His fianc is in town...

1633
01:31:02,703 --> 01:31:04,898
and he's giving a party tonight
at the Park Avenue Hotel...

1634
01:31:04,972 --> 01:31:06,906
and he wants you to come.
Says he'll call back.

1635
01:31:06,974 --> 01:31:09,534
Did Mr. Kendall call?
I've been trying to reach him all afternoon.

1636
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:13,205
Yes, three or four times.
He says he'll be here at 8:00.

1637
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,714
Oh, what is it now? Oh, 7:00.

1638
01:31:16,049 --> 01:31:18,483
Everybody in New York's been calling you.

1639
01:31:18,552 --> 01:31:20,213
I've written it all down.

1640
01:31:20,287 --> 01:31:22,050
Oh. Thank you.

1641
01:31:22,523 --> 01:31:25,219
But where on earth have you been?
I thought you were lost.

1642
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:27,487
I've been walking for blocks.

1643
01:31:28,395 --> 01:31:32,354
Harriet, I did something today
that I've wanted to do for years...

1644
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:35,261
and I feel perfectly marvelous.

1645
01:31:35,335 --> 01:31:36,859
Well, that's fine.

1646
01:31:36,937 --> 01:31:40,168
Harriet, would you say I was a woman
who knew her own mind?

1647
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,707
Yes, I would.

1648
01:31:41,775 --> 01:31:44,744
Well, I've made up my mind
to marry Mr. Kendall.

1649
01:31:44,811 --> 01:31:46,938
Well, congratulations.

1650
01:31:47,514 --> 01:31:49,209
Thank you, Harriet.

1651
01:31:49,683 --> 01:31:51,776
Did a dress arrive for me from Jerdan's?

1652
01:31:51,852 --> 01:31:53,183
Oh, that explains it.

1653
01:31:53,253 --> 01:31:55,949
I thought it was something
you bought for Miss Deirdre.

1654
01:31:56,023 --> 01:31:58,014
Well, I felt very young when I bought it.

1655
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:00,252
As a matter of fact,
this is my second blooming.

1656
01:32:00,327 --> 01:32:02,420
Life has been very good to me.

1657
01:32:02,496 --> 01:32:06,364
Oh, I would look like a hag of 90
when I want to look like Shirley Temple.

1658
01:32:06,433 --> 01:32:09,095
Harriet, have the little florist on the corner
send up some roses...

1659
01:32:09,169 --> 01:32:11,069
and put on that table by the fire.

1660
01:32:11,138 --> 01:32:14,130
I'll take it.
And put some champagne on ice.

1661
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,041
- And be sure and wear your black uniform.
- All right.

1662
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:41,295
- Good evening, Mr. Kendall.
- Hello, Harriet.

1663
01:32:41,802 --> 01:32:43,633
Let me take your things.

1664
01:32:45,572 --> 01:32:49,030
- Well, that's very becoming.
- Thank you, Harriet.

1665
01:32:50,377 --> 01:32:53,107
Miss Marlowe is upstairs.
I'll tell her you're here.

1666
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,614
- She'll be down in a minute.
- All right.

1667
01:32:55,882 --> 01:32:58,282
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, Harriet.

1668
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:08,184
Hello, darling.

1669
01:33:11,598 --> 01:33:12,963
Hello, Kit.

1670
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,931
You look very handsome
in your uniform, Lieutenant.

1671
01:33:17,004 --> 01:33:18,767
I should think it was a nice feeling.

1672
01:33:18,839 --> 01:33:20,204
Yes, it is.

1673
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:23,640
You look beautiful tonight, Kit.

1674
01:33:23,977 --> 01:33:26,207
That's what I was waiting for.

1675
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,143
Now I can come down.

1676
01:33:29,516 --> 01:33:32,349
Are you sure
I don't look haggard and worn...

1677
01:33:32,419 --> 01:33:35,388
with what the critics call, my genius?

1678
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,986
No, I've never seen you look so lovely.

1679
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:41,828
Why, Rudd, I'm overcome.

1680
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,528
Darling.

1681
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:53,938
I had Harriet put some champagne on ice,
to celebrate.

1682
01:33:54,908 --> 01:33:57,809
I think it's about the last bottle we have.

1683
01:34:03,784 --> 01:34:06,378
Well, darling,
aren't you going to do the honors?

1684
01:34:06,453 --> 01:34:07,943
Oh, of course.

1685
01:34:20,634 --> 01:34:23,068
It seems ages since I've seen you...

1686
01:34:24,037 --> 01:34:26,471
and yet it's only been a few days.

1687
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:31,677
Here you are.

1688
01:34:32,946 --> 01:34:34,675
Thank you, darling.

1689
01:34:36,249 --> 01:34:38,240
Well, here's to you, Kit.

1690
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,187
Here's to...

1691
01:34:42,322 --> 01:34:43,789
To you, Rudd.

1692
01:34:52,532 --> 01:34:55,990
Darling, I must have seemed very abrupt
with you the other morning.

1693
01:34:56,069 --> 01:34:58,663
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, you were being honest, Kit.

1694
01:34:58,739 --> 01:35:00,570
And you were perfectly right.

1695
01:35:03,243 --> 01:35:05,234
- You mean, about us?
- Yes.

1696
01:35:05,512 --> 01:35:09,710
Now, I suppose a woman's intuition
is better than a man's, after all.

1697
01:35:11,351 --> 01:35:14,787
Then you mean that
you agree with me now, is that it?

1698
01:35:14,855 --> 01:35:16,186
Yes, I do.

1699
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:19,821
I must admit, I felt pretty awful
about the other morning...

1700
01:35:19,893 --> 01:35:22,123
but now I'm sure you were right.

1701
01:35:22,195 --> 01:35:23,287
But, Rudd...

1702
01:35:23,363 --> 01:35:26,332
It's funny, isn't it,
how things work themselves out?

1703
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:29,131
- Funny?
- Yes, the whole business.

1704
01:35:29,202 --> 01:35:31,727
Rudd, what are you trying to tell me?

1705
01:35:31,805 --> 01:35:33,705
Well, something's happened, Kit...

1706
01:35:33,774 --> 01:35:37,232
which can't be any more of a surprise
to you than it was to me.

1707
01:35:38,078 --> 01:35:41,104
Darling, nothing could surprise me today.

1708
01:35:42,015 --> 01:35:43,380
What is it?

1709
01:35:43,683 --> 01:35:47,016
Well, I've fallen in love with Deirdre.

1710
01:35:49,055 --> 01:35:52,354
- With Deirdre?
- Yes. Can you believe it?

1711
01:35:58,698 --> 01:35:59,960
Why, yes.

1712
01:36:01,735 --> 01:36:03,896
Yes, of course I can believe it.

1713
01:36:03,970 --> 01:36:05,699
It began the other morning
when I left you...

1714
01:36:05,772 --> 01:36:08,536
feeling so hopeless
because you wouldn't marry me.

1715
01:36:08,608 --> 01:36:11,168
Deirdre was feeling rather blue
about something, too...

1716
01:36:11,244 --> 01:36:12,871
and, well, we went for a walk.

1717
01:36:12,946 --> 01:36:15,608
Then we had lunch at the Colony and...

1718
01:36:25,592 --> 01:36:28,789
Kit, this couldn't mean anything to you,
could it?

1719
01:36:30,664 --> 01:36:34,532
Why, Rudd, of course not.
I'm delighted for you both.

1720
01:36:35,502 --> 01:36:37,970
Oh, I'm glad to hear you say that.

1721
01:36:38,038 --> 01:36:40,836
I do feel rather funny
about telling you this.

1722
01:36:40,907 --> 01:36:42,499
Oh, but you mustn't.

1723
01:36:42,576 --> 01:36:46,171
If I'm acting peculiarly,
it's only because it's been such a shock.

1724
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:49,238
I just never had thought
of you and Deirdre.

1725
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:51,983
That's what I meant
the other morning when I said...

1726
01:36:52,052 --> 01:36:54,953
you should marry some nice young girl
and settle down.

1727
01:36:55,021 --> 01:36:57,717
And I think Deirdre's
a very nice young girl.

1728
01:36:57,791 --> 01:37:00,055
And I've always wanted the best for her.

1729
01:37:00,126 --> 01:37:02,185
And now I'm sure she'll have it.

1730
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:03,661
Thanks, Kit.

1731
01:37:06,299 --> 01:37:08,767
It's sort of a protective sense, I guess.

1732
01:37:08,835 --> 01:37:10,427
She's such a kid.

1733
01:37:10,504 --> 01:37:14,440
I want to slap her if she does wrong
yet I'd kill anyone who'd touch her.

1734
01:37:14,508 --> 01:37:16,408
Do you know what I mean?

1735
01:37:16,476 --> 01:37:18,774
Of course I know what you mean.

1736
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:20,944
Have you told her that you love her?

1737
01:37:21,014 --> 01:37:24,415
Yes, we told each other.
I asked her to marry me.

1738
01:37:25,519 --> 01:37:27,487
Weren't you planning
to see her this evening?

1739
01:37:27,554 --> 01:37:29,681
Well, her father's giving a party
at this hotel.

1740
01:37:29,756 --> 01:37:31,383
I'm supposed to meet her there.

1741
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:34,188
Well, you'd better be going, Rudd.
She'll be wondering where you are.

1742
01:37:34,261 --> 01:37:36,695
Well, if you don't mind, Kit,
I guess I should.

1743
01:37:36,763 --> 01:37:38,628
Oh, no, of course not.

1744
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,765
Rudd, have you heard
where you're going to be stationed?

1745
01:37:43,837 --> 01:37:45,361
Well, no, I haven't yet.

1746
01:37:45,438 --> 01:37:47,633
You must be sure and let me know
where you'll be.

1747
01:37:47,707 --> 01:37:49,106
I will, Kit.

1748
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:51,304
Thanks.

1749
01:38:01,354 --> 01:38:03,686
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Kit.

1750
01:38:07,294 --> 01:38:08,454
Kit...

1751
01:38:09,262 --> 01:38:12,493
just to have known you,
I'll always be grateful.

1752
01:38:16,136 --> 01:38:19,071
It's been an enchanted patch
we've had, Rudd.

1753
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:21,539
Like a spell of perfect weather.

1754
01:38:21,608 --> 01:38:24,008
It's been like that to me, too, Kit.

1755
01:38:25,579 --> 01:38:26,773
Goodbye.

1756
01:38:37,023 --> 01:38:39,014
- Harriet.
- Yes, ma'am.

1757
01:38:40,093 --> 01:38:42,618
Harriet, bring down
my Persian lamb coat, will you?

1758
01:38:42,696 --> 01:38:45,392
- And call a cab, immediately.
- All right.

1759
01:39:31,411 --> 01:39:34,938
Harriet, call Major Drake
at the Park Avenue Hotel...

1760
01:39:35,248 --> 01:39:38,479
and tell him not to let Mr. Kendall leave
under any circumstances...

1761
01:39:38,551 --> 01:39:40,314
until Miss Drake arrives.

1762
01:39:40,387 --> 01:39:43,823
- And you needn't wait up for me.
- Well, where is Mr. Kendall?

1763
01:39:44,357 --> 01:39:47,793
Harriet, you're looking
at the biggest fool that ever lived.

1764
01:39:48,595 --> 01:39:50,756
Oh, Miss Marlowe, don't.

1765
01:40:19,426 --> 01:40:21,155
- Mr. Grant?
- Yes.

1766
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:23,158
I'm Katherine Marlowe.

1767
01:40:23,897 --> 01:40:26,491
Did the man at the desk
tell you I was on my way up?

1768
01:40:26,566 --> 01:40:27,999
Yeah, he did.

1769
01:40:28,635 --> 01:40:31,069
Would you mind very much if I came in?

1770
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:33,962
Not at all. Come in.

1771
01:40:40,246 --> 01:40:43,010
Charming. Typical bachelor's lair.

1772
01:40:44,951 --> 01:40:48,785
- So you're the Katherine Marlowe.
- I've often been referred to as that.

1773
01:40:48,855 --> 01:40:51,221
- I've heard a great deal about you.
- Have you?

1774
01:40:51,291 --> 01:40:53,623
- Oh, that's the bedroom.
- Really?

1775
01:40:54,761 --> 01:40:57,696
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you very much.

1776
01:40:58,264 --> 01:41:01,097
- I will have a cigarette, though.
- Why, certainly.

1777
01:41:04,037 --> 01:41:05,334
Thank you.

1778
01:41:10,143 --> 01:41:12,737
- Do you mind if I sit down?
- Please do.

1779
01:41:12,912 --> 01:41:15,506
This will be quite comfortable, thank you.

1780
01:41:18,852 --> 01:41:21,912
I presume there is no need
for me to tell you why I'm here.

1781
01:41:22,388 --> 01:41:23,980
I've come for Deirdre.

1782
01:41:24,057 --> 01:41:26,548
- Oh, the little Drake number.
- Yes.

1783
01:41:26,693 --> 01:41:29,821
- What would she be doing here?
- Well, that's what I've come to find out.

1784
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:32,456
Look, Miss Marlowe, I don't know
where you got the weird idea...

1785
01:41:32,532 --> 01:41:35,126
- but if you think that I...
- You're far from convincing, Mr. Grant.

1786
01:41:35,201 --> 01:41:37,066
- Now, really.
- Deirdre!

1787
01:41:40,039 --> 01:41:42,701
- Come out from behind that screen.
- Now look, Miss Marlowe, I...

1788
01:41:42,776 --> 01:41:47,179
Deirdre, are you coming out by yourself
or shall I come over and drag you out?

1789
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:53,011
How did you know I was there?

1790
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,084
My dear, I was hiding behind screens
before you were born.

1791
01:41:58,458 --> 01:42:02,053
Well, I won't be treated like this.
I won't be followed about like a child.

1792
01:42:02,796 --> 01:42:05,264
Mr. Grant, would you get
Deirdre's hat and coat, please?

1793
01:42:05,331 --> 01:42:08,732
I'm old enough to take care of myself
and to lead my own life.

1794
01:42:08,835 --> 01:42:11,861
Mr. Grant, would you get
Deirdre's hat and coat, please?

1795
01:42:11,938 --> 01:42:13,132
Gladly.

1796
01:42:13,907 --> 01:42:16,102
Oh, why don't you let me alone?

1797
01:42:21,881 --> 01:42:23,109
Deirdre...

1798
01:42:23,883 --> 01:42:26,317
I gave you credit
for more intelligence than this.

1799
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,111
If you insist
upon throwing yourself away...

1800
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:31,623
for heaven's sake,
do it with a little originality.

1801
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:33,716
This is definitely old hat.

1802
01:42:34,394 --> 01:42:37,090
- That goes for the way you're dressed, too.
- What are you doing to me?

1803
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:39,427
What's the matter
with the way I'm dressed?

1804
01:42:39,499 --> 01:42:42,400
You're a fine one to criticize anything I do.

1805
01:42:43,603 --> 01:42:46,367
Deirdre, I have never made a practice
of slapping people...

1806
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:49,408
but I'm dangerously close
to slapping you right now.

1807
01:42:49,475 --> 01:42:50,942
Here you are.

1808
01:42:51,344 --> 01:42:52,641
Thank you.

1809
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,480
- Come on, Deirdre.
- I'm not going.

1810
01:42:56,649 --> 01:42:59,209
Deirdre, I want no more nonsense.
Come on.

1811
01:42:59,285 --> 01:43:00,684
By the way, Miss Marlowe...

1812
01:43:00,753 --> 01:43:03,187
if there's anyone else you know
in my little black book...

1813
01:43:03,256 --> 01:43:05,520
I'll be only too glad
to cross them out right now.

1814
01:43:05,592 --> 01:43:08,356
I know practically
everyone in New York, Mr. Grant.

1815
01:43:08,962 --> 01:43:11,829
- Shall I call a taxi?
- No, thank you, I had mine wait.

1816
01:43:12,165 --> 01:43:14,725
I'm sick and tired
of everyone interfering with me.

1817
01:43:14,801 --> 01:43:17,326
- Good night, Mr. Grant.
- Good night, Miss Marlowe.

1818
01:43:17,403 --> 01:43:18,995
You went to Lucien's tonight...

1819
01:43:19,072 --> 01:43:22,269
because of what you heard
about Rudd and me, didn't you?

1820
01:43:22,342 --> 01:43:24,071
- Well, I...
- Didn't you?

1821
01:43:25,144 --> 01:43:27,339
- Well, yes.
- I thought so.

1822
01:43:27,447 --> 01:43:31,042
- And you're in love with Rudd, aren't you?
- That has nothing to do with it.

1823
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:35,380
- I don't see why you don't marry him.
- Because he doesn't want to marry me.

1824
01:43:35,889 --> 01:43:40,326
And, well, no nice woman wants to marry
a man who doesn't want to marry her.

1825
01:43:40,693 --> 01:43:43,685
- But Rudd's in love with you, isn't he?
- He was, Deirdre.

1826
01:43:43,963 --> 01:43:47,091
- He isn't anymore.
- You mean he just stopped suddenly?

1827
01:43:47,934 --> 01:43:51,392
You can't say
when you stop loving somebody, Deirdre.

1828
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:54,205
All you know is that you have stopped.

1829
01:43:54,274 --> 01:43:57,004
But you haven't stopped loving him,
have you?

1830
01:43:58,578 --> 01:44:01,547
To be quite honest with you, no, not yet.

1831
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:05,340
But I shan't go on loving him forever.

1832
01:44:05,585 --> 01:44:08,247
Anyway, the thing has happened...

1833
01:44:08,688 --> 01:44:12,556
and, well, thank God it's happened now
and not a year from now.

1834
01:44:13,092 --> 01:44:15,219
I don't think I could have taken it then.

1835
01:44:21,334 --> 01:44:22,961
Well, here we are.

1836
01:44:24,203 --> 01:44:28,299
Deirdre, you think over everything
I've said and you'll realize I'm right.

1837
01:44:28,641 --> 01:44:31,371
Kit, if I'd only known,
this never would've happened.

1838
01:44:31,444 --> 01:44:34,641
But if it hadn't been you, darling,
it might have been someone else.

1839
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:37,547
And I'm happy it was you.
You're so right for each other.

1840
01:44:38,518 --> 01:44:40,611
Now, come on. Rudd's waiting for you.

1841
01:44:40,687 --> 01:44:41,745
Kit...

1842
01:44:42,722 --> 01:44:44,383
tell me something.

1843
01:44:45,191 --> 01:44:47,682
Was my father ever in love with you?

1844
01:44:48,828 --> 01:44:51,126
Yes, he was, once.

1845
01:44:52,532 --> 01:44:54,523
Kit, I can't tell you...

1846
01:44:55,301 --> 01:44:58,361
You're just about
the most wonderful person I know.

1847
01:44:58,438 --> 01:45:00,269
Oh, nonsense.

1848
01:45:00,673 --> 01:45:02,197
I'm not at all.

1849
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:04,973
Darling, it's late...

1850
01:45:05,445 --> 01:45:09,677
and I'm very, very tired
of youth and love and self-sacrifice.

1851
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:12,015
Now come on.

1852
01:45:16,489 --> 01:45:19,014
- Good night, Kit.
- Good luck, darling.

1853
01:45:21,661 --> 01:45:22,992
Now you be happy.

1854
01:45:23,062 --> 01:45:26,520
That's what I want most in the world,
for you to be happy.

1855
01:45:45,318 --> 01:45:47,047
Where to now, lady?

1856
01:45:47,954 --> 01:45:49,046
Oh.

1857
01:45:50,089 --> 01:45:52,080
Well, I really don't know.

1858
01:45:54,293 --> 01:45:56,056
Drive me around for a while, will you?

1859
01:45:56,129 --> 01:45:59,758
I'm sorry. I can't cruise around these days.
Gas rationing.

1860
01:46:02,702 --> 01:46:04,192
Gas rationing.

1861
01:46:05,004 --> 01:46:06,471
That's right.

1862
01:46:08,374 --> 01:46:10,808
Well, I guess
you'd better take me back home.

1863
01:46:10,877 --> 01:46:12,242
Yes, ma'am.

1864
01:46:31,197 --> 01:46:33,961
Well, Millie, imagine finding you here.

1865
01:46:35,435 --> 01:46:38,802
Kit, it's hard for me to apologize.

1866
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,840
Anything I may have said today...

1867
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:45,136
I didn't mean it.

1868
01:46:46,679 --> 01:46:48,340
Forget it, Millie.

1869
01:46:50,216 --> 01:46:51,843
I've been a fool.

1870
01:46:53,152 --> 01:46:55,985
I... I know you must hate me...

1871
01:46:56,489 --> 01:46:59,981
but if you could find it in your heart
to forgive me.

1872
01:47:01,661 --> 01:47:03,959
Of course I forgive you, Millie.

1873
01:47:04,197 --> 01:47:06,290
I'm not even angry anymore.

1874
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:08,790
Thank you, Kit.

1875
01:47:15,775 --> 01:47:19,871
Millie, how about a glass
of nice, flat champagne?

1876
01:47:20,947 --> 01:47:24,644
- Do you think I should?
- Oh, come on. It'll be good for both of us.

1877
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:28,320
Well, I never have, but all right.

1878
01:47:29,088 --> 01:47:31,181
There comes a time
in every woman's life...

1879
01:47:31,257 --> 01:47:34,556
when the only thing that helps
is a glass of champagne.

1880
01:47:35,128 --> 01:47:38,222
It's been a strange sort of day,
hasn't it, Kit?

1881
01:47:38,631 --> 01:47:40,622
That's putting it mildly.

1882
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,692
I didn't expect you back so soon.

1883
01:47:42,768 --> 01:47:45,601
I thought you'd be out
celebrating with Rudd.

1884
01:47:45,671 --> 01:47:47,571
Millie, brace yourself.

1885
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:50,167
I've something to tell you.

1886
01:47:50,576 --> 01:47:51,634
Yes?

1887
01:47:51,978 --> 01:47:55,243
Rudd is getting married, but not to me.

1888
01:47:56,549 --> 01:47:57,607
Oh.

1889
01:47:58,618 --> 01:47:59,949
Thank you.

1890
01:48:01,654 --> 01:48:05,556
Well, if he's not going to marry you,
who is he going to marry?

1891
01:48:06,325 --> 01:48:07,553
Deirdre.

1892
01:48:08,294 --> 01:48:09,522
Deirdre?

1893
01:48:10,563 --> 01:48:12,053
Are you joking?

1894
01:48:12,798 --> 01:48:14,925
No, Millie. Far from it.

1895
01:48:15,501 --> 01:48:17,162
Deirdre and Rudd.

1896
01:48:17,303 --> 01:48:20,670
But they don't even know each other,
do they, or more than casually?

1897
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:24,005
Apparently they knew each other
well enough for that.

1898
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:26,573
I can't believe it.

1899
01:48:27,413 --> 01:48:31,008
Don't be upset, Millie.
Deirdre was bound to marry someday.

1900
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:33,017
And Rudd couldn't be nicer.

1901
01:48:33,386 --> 01:48:35,547
As a matter of fact, aside from Preston...

1902
01:48:35,621 --> 01:48:38,647
Rudd is the only other man
I ever wanted to marry.

1903
01:48:38,724 --> 01:48:42,353
And I'm just conceited enough
to think that that means something.

1904
01:48:42,428 --> 01:48:45,397
But it wouldn't have worked out, Kit.
You know that.

1905
01:48:45,464 --> 01:48:47,056
You're probably right.

1906
01:48:48,467 --> 01:48:50,025
Oh, my goodness.

1907
01:48:50,102 --> 01:48:53,003
- Millie, what is it?
- This changes everything.

1908
01:48:53,072 --> 01:48:54,198
Changes what?

1909
01:48:54,273 --> 01:48:57,037
My new book,
the one I told you I was writing.

1910
01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:58,906
You see, it's about two women friends.

1911
01:48:58,978 --> 01:49:00,639
They're practically brought up together.

1912
01:49:00,713 --> 01:49:02,772
They have their ups and downs,
and finally...

1913
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,110
You mean, like us?

1914
01:49:04,183 --> 01:49:06,674
Oh, the characters are all imaginary but...

1915
01:49:06,752 --> 01:49:08,083
In a way, yes.

1916
01:49:08,588 --> 01:49:11,113
Millie, you never cease to amaze me.

1917
01:49:11,424 --> 01:49:12,584
No, really.

1918
01:49:12,658 --> 01:49:16,287
It's your not marrying Rudd
and both of us finding ourselves lonely.

1919
01:49:16,362 --> 01:49:18,830
If I finish it that way,
well, of all my books...

1920
01:49:18,898 --> 01:49:21,696
it'll be the first sad ending
I've ever written.

1921
01:49:21,767 --> 01:49:24,258
Well, Millie, you've always said
you wanted to write...

1922
01:49:24,337 --> 01:49:26,567
what you call "an artistic flop."

1923
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:27,970
Maybe this will be it.

1924
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,168
No, Kit. The public doesn't expect
a sad ending from me.

1925
01:49:31,244 --> 01:49:33,610
Two women left all alone like this.

1926
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,170
- What you going to call it?
- Well, I'm not sure.

1927
01:49:36,249 --> 01:49:37,739
I've had several ideas.

1928
01:49:37,817 --> 01:49:40,342
What do you think of <i>Auld Lang Syne?</i>

1929
01:49:40,953 --> 01:49:44,980
Well, if it's about us,
why not <i>Old Acquaintance?</i>

1930
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:47,286
<i>Old Acquaintance.</i>

1931
01:49:48,628 --> 01:49:51,597
<i>Old Acquaintance.</i> Of course, Kit.

1932
01:49:52,865 --> 01:49:54,992
Let's drink to that, Millie.
