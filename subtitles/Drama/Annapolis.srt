1
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,227
Five,

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,962
six,

3
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,960
seven.

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,408
Listen, stay away, stay away,
let's get out of the round.

5
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,781
Just stay away.
Jake. Jake!

6
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,278
Jake!

7
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,183
That's it, punch him.
Come on.

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,920
One, two, three,

9
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,261
four, five, six,

10
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,700
seven, eight, nine, ten.

11
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,760
He's out.

12
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:33,338
- You look like you got your ass kicked.
- That's an early birthday present.

13
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,974
Oh, yeah? So when you started crying,
was that part of the present?

14
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,611
Son of a bitch.
Started crying? I would never cry.

15
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:46,057
He was down for eight, crawled back up.
I felt so sorry for him, I took a nap.

16
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,911
Hey, Jake.

17
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,711
Jake!

18
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,288
- You do the work on H-2?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,988
Well, your cross-weld seams got bubbles.

20
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,964
- They looked fine.
- Do 'em over.

21
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,180
Jake, there's some guy from the Naval
Academy out there looking for you.

22
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,121
- That's funny.
- I'm serious, man.

23
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:54,659
He's out there looking for you right now.

24
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,662
- He say what he wanted?
- No.

25
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,679
Excuse me, sir.

26
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,408
I'm Jake Huard.

27
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,815
Lieutenant Commander Burton,
United States Naval Academy.

28
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,016
Your application
made for some interesting reading.

29
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,253
- Thank you.
- I kept going over it,

30
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,057
to figure out why a congressman
would give a nomination

31
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,098
to someone with
such mediocre grades and test scores.

32
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,796
- He didn't want to give it to me at first.
- That's what he told me.

33
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,772
He also said you were
the biggest pain in the ass he'd ever met.

34
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,572
- I had to go back a couple times.
- How many?

35
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,237
34 straight days, sir.

36
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,154
We've had some spots open up
in this year's class.

37
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:02,160
Couple kids decided last minute
they'd rather have fun at college.

38
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,253
Induction day is tomorrow.

39
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,925
I'm gonna be honest with you.
This is not an ideal situation.

40
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,698
You'll be way behind the other students.
They've had months to prepare.

41
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,263
That's all right, sir.

42
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,901
- Well, then, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

43
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,605
I'll see you tomorrow at 0630.

44
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,806
I don't get it. I mean, I don't know
why you want to go to that place so bad.

45
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,507
I mean, we're rivets. We build ships.

46
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,119
Can you remember when my mom
used to take us there when we were kids?

47
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,251
Yeah, and we all wanted
to wear the uniform and be the hero.

48
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,125
But we were little kids then, Jake.

49
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,967
- Well, I never stopped wanting that.
- So, this place isn't good enough for you?

50
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:21,598
No, that's not it.
I just don't want to build ships.

51
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,871
And what happens if that doesn't work out?

52
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,936
It's gonna work out.

53
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,078
I mean, I got dreams too, man.

54
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,752
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,919
Like going to Sir Frankie's tonight
and getting shitfaced.

56
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,553
Tonight's your night.

57
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,595
We got plenty of room over at the VIP table
if you guys wanna join us.

58
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,299
All right, Romeo.

59
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:59,242
These girls are all over your Navy buddies,
man. Look at this place.

60
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,779
- Oh, yes.
- Al right.

61
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,246
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

62
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,805
To Jake.

63
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,649
Listen, guys. You're my best friends
for as long as I can remember.

64
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:15,820
That's why I gotta get outta here. If I can't
find better guys than you, I'm in trouble.

65
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,729
See you at Christmas.
Be good.

66
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,564
Yo, wait up.

67
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,572
Look at her. You see the girl over there
with the long black hair?

68
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,609
Yeah.

69
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,703
Couple of us chipped in.

70
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,606
- What, she's a hooker?
- No, she's not a hooker.

71
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,483
She's an escort.

72
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,386
Get outta here.

73
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,187
Look, I swear on my mother.

74
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,287
OK? Just go talk to her.
She ain't gonna bite you.

75
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,333
That cost too much.

76
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,402
Hi.

77
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,171
I'm Jake.

78
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,675
Ali.

79
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:11,649
So, look... This is probably, like,
business as usual for you,

80
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,585
but I've never
done anything like this before.

81
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,485
Uh...

82
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,717
Look, so you can just keep the money, I...

83
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,885
What are you talking about?

84
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,125
I swear on my mother.

85
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,700
- You're not a prostitute.
- Uh, no, I...

86
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,502
I am.

87
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,635
But I'm really late
for my next appointment, so...

88
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,944
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

89
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,850
I'm sorry. OK?
They did say you were really expensive.

90
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,981
Why did you think your friends
were trying to get you a prostitute, Jake?

91
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,083
You trying to lose your virginity?

92
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,818
Uh, actually...

93
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,888
You were supposed to be
my going-away present.

94
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,491
I'm going to the Naval Academy tomorrow.

95
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,035
- You are?
- Yeah.

96
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,095
It's a fairly rigorous selection process.

97
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,641
Yeah, I know that. I've heard.

98
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:14,169
Well, if you're interested, maybe
we could get together. I'll give you a tour.

99
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,237
You know, I would love that.

100
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,216
I'm... kinda feeling a connection here.

101
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
- You are?
- Yeah.

102
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,222
I mean, with me
so close to going to war, and...

103
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,452
You're going to the academy.

104
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,723
Well, yeah.
I think we should ask ourselves:

105
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,426
Can we afford to pass up
what is possibly our one night together?

106
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:39,096
- I'm gonna do something about it.
- Is that right?

107
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,499
- I... Just think about that.
- AJ, chill.

108
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,976
All right, all right, all right. AJ. AJ!

109
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,479
What? I'm just saying hi
to your new friends.

110
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,778
OK. All right.

111
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,327
You all set?

112
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,373
You sure this is what you want to do?
You're close to getting your hours.

113
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,343
I don't want to join the union, Dad.

114
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,176
Well, tell me.
What the hell is it you do want?

115
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,345
I mean, come on, Jake.
Who we kidding?

116
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:32,380
You don't listen to me or anybody here,
and you're gonna take orders from them?

117
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,019
I'm sorry
I didn't give you two weeks' notice.

118
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,859
Jake, Jake.

119
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,363
I'll give you a ride.

120
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,246
I'll see you at Christmas.

121
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,232
- Go get 'em, son.
- I love you, Mom.

122
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,139
All right, smile, now.

123
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:30,172
<i> 20 months ago</i>.
<i>50.000 young men and women</i>

124
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,242
<i>inquired about applying to this academy.</i>

125
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,055
<i>But this morning. Only 1207 of you</i>
<i>passed through these gates.</i>

126
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:47,192
<i>Some of you have</i>
<i>only known success your entire life.</i>

127
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,662
<i>But this year. Your plebe year</i>.
<i>You will know failure.</i>

128
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,966
Welcome to the academy.

129
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:03,174
<i>Because failure</i>
<i>is a far greater teacher than success.</i>

130
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:10,078
Our standards
are both high and uncompromising.

131
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,387
Some of you will fail to meet them.

132
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,292
We make no apology for that

133
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,423
because the mission
we have been entrusted with,

134
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:25,903
transforming you
from civilians into naval officers,

135
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,303
is too important.

136
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,274
Left. Left. Left, right, left...

137
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,689
- Lock those elbows, Nance.
- Ma'am, aye aye, ma'am!

138
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,918
Come on, move it, meatheads, run!
Go, go, go!

139
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,795
Keep that rifle up.

140
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,263
You look surprised, Plebe Huard.

141
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,067
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

142
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,367
How many buildings at the academy
are named for admirals?

143
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,209
- Ma'am, I'll find out, ma'am.
- That's one of your rates.

144
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,909
You're required to know that information.

145
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,646
Especially if you're gonna be offering tours.

146
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,585
Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

147
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,385
- Now drop and gimme 20.
- Aye aye, ma'am.

148
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,800
What is that smell?

149
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,501
- Is that you, Estrada?
- Sir, no, sir.

150
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,873
You been taking Puerto Rican showers
instead of regular ones?

151
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,742
- That what you're doing?
- Sir, no, sir!

152
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,941
You stink.

153
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:49,352
How about your beard?
Plebes are supposed to be clean-shaven.

154
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,686
Sir, I shaved this morning, sir.
I just have a thick beard, sir.

155
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:58,287
I want you to shower and shave
every three hours after lights out.

156
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:02,391
And no more cologne.
Do you understand, Estrada?

157
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,096
Sir, yes, sir!

158
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,437
At ease.

159
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,774
Attention on deck.

160
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,213
Midshipman Lieutenant Cole.

161
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,787
Get in.

162
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,393
Sir, aye aye, sir.

163
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,670
- Zip it up.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

164
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:36,727
I want you all to remember
what that bag looks like with a body in it,

165
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:42,756
'cause if you become officers, this is where
they're gonna put your mistakes.

166
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,995
- Do you understand me?
- Sir, yes, sir.

167
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,345
All of you came straight here
from high school.

168
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,305
But not me.

169
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:05,247
Before I got here,
I served three years in the Marines.

170
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,686
Which means I'm more than
just a senior at this academy.

171
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,199
I am someone who knows
exactly what it takes to become an officer.

172
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,098
And I will accept nothing less from you.

173
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,833
If that's not what you signed up for,

174
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:31,015
there's nothing wrong with that.
Just let me know now.

175
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,244
Just raise your hand.

176
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,157
All right.

177
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,487
Let's go for a little jog.

178
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,897
Go!

179
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,898
Go, go.

180
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,168
Move it!

181
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,301
Come on, Huard.

182
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,346
Let's go.

183
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,075
Risa, what are you doing?
Come on, let's go.

184
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,879
Move it. Oh, God...

185
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,216
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Faster, come on.

186
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,219
Let's go, let's go. Move it.

187
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,259
Come on, let's go. Move it, move it.

188
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,665
Yo, move it, move it.

189
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,732
You letting this girl beat you, Nance?
Move it, go.

190
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,203
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

191
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,680
- Come on, Loo.
- Don't let him beat you, Loo.

192
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,114
Don't let him beat you.

193
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,519
- Come on, Huard.
- Come on, Loo, move those feet.

194
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,922
Move those feet!
Run it out, Huard, run it out.

195
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,120
- Good job, Loo. You too, Huard.
- Let's go, Estrada.

196
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,164
- Come on, Risa.
- Estrada, move. Move!

197
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,757
Finish line's right here.

198
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,736
Run. Keep doing it.
Come on, just a little further.

199
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,706
- Let's go, Echo Company.
- Run it out, guys, run it out.

200
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,299
That's right, come on.
You're almost there.

201
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,245
Let's go now.
All right, a little bit more.

202
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,544
Good job.

203
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,163
- What's the problem here?
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.

204
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,865
- Stop trying and do it.
- Aye aye, sir.

205
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,841
Come on, you butterball, move it.
Move it.

206
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,813
There's a big juicy steak
waiting for you, and yams.

207
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,646
Holy shit! You are pathetic.

208
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,157
You're the only one
who can't make it up this thing.

209
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,217
From now on,
I'm gonna start calling you Twins.

210
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,427
You know why, Twins?

211
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
Because I'm carrying the weight
of two human beings, sir.

212
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,935
You're smart, too.
So you should be able to figure out

213
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,634
that if you don't get your fat ass
up this climb by the end of this year,

214
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,338
your fat ass is gonna be separated.

215
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,099
What the hell are you doing?

216
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,905
Just reminding myself
of what I'm fighting for.

217
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,712
Hey, Huard.

218
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:54,047
Don't worry. That book's
gonna be all in your head soon.

219
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,246
Yeah, I hope.

220
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,915
You should learn to make your bed first.

221
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,055
What?

222
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,891
Fold's gotta be 12 inches from the top.

223
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,000
Loo.

224
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,107
Nance.

225
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,012
What the hell? We only been here a week.

226
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,913
- Estrada.
- Nice!

227
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:33,321
Oh, this is from that chick
that I met at the shore this summer.

228
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,658
Ho ho!

229
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,329
Sorry, Carmen.

230
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,534
Before you achieve,
you must believe.

231
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,270
Before you achieve, you must believe.

232
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:56,905
Before you achieve, you must believe.

233
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,985
Before you achieve, you must believe.

234
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,780
Hey. Doctor Phil.

235
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,188
Shut your hole.

236
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,392
20.

237
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,228
54º, 85' north.

238
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,133
15.

239
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:21,332
166º, 10' west.

240
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,141
- Let me help you.
- 10.

241
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,370
I got it.

242
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,270
- There's a headwind here...
- I got it.

243
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,945
40º, 80' north.

244
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,010
Five.

245
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,613
Come on, Jake.

246
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,521
Time.

247
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,126
Drill's over, Huard.

248
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,993
Next squad, you're up.

249
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,768
Make me a believer.
One, two, three, four...

250
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:06,842
Mike Tyson once said,
"Everybody's got a plan until they get hit."

251
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,886
You can say what you want about Tyson,

252
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,754
but that's the smartest goddamn thing
I ever heard anybody say about boxing.

253
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,089
Centre that weight.
You got no balance, I'd push you right over.

254
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,287
Aye aye, sir.

255
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,798
That is why we teach boxing here.

256
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,996
You see, the powers that be
want to see how you react

257
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,766
when you get popped in that mouth.

258
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,340
They want to see how you hold up

259
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,937
when your little plan goes to hell.

260
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,208
Get that chin down.
Want to get knocked out?

261
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:41,116
In 40 seconds
you're on the focus mitts with me.

262
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:44,280
Pretty good, Huard. You boxed before?

263
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,590
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you can tell.

264
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,628
Jab's good, straight right's pretty crisp.

265
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,664
Yeah. You hook like a girl, though.

266
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,236
I hook like a girl?

267
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,610
- Hey, Loo.
- Hey.

268
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,581
- You finished your calc homework yet?
- Ah, jeez...

269
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,175
- I just wanna check my answers.
- Nice try, Estrada.

270
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,278
- I didn't get a chance to finish mine.
- Look, I made the time.

271
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:20,051
- It's just a homework assignment.
- Sorry, man.

272
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,288
You know how you're gonna die, Loo?
Friendly fire.

273
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,524
- I'll help you.
- No offence, but I wanna pass, Huard.

274
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,499
What is this?

275
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,403
Restricted diet means no pogey bait,

276
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,498
Twins!

277
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,203
Shove off.

278
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:56,021
You do understand what "shove off"
means, don't you, Huard?

279
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,858
Oh, I forgot. You're a wait lister.

280
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,693
Well.

281
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,299
Since you're here, why don't you
clean up your shipmate's mess?

282
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,360
Psst.

283
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,897
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

284
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,615
What are you looking at? Porn?

285
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,347
It's not porn.

286
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:05,419
- Was that parade for you?
- I'm from kind of a small town,

287
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,193
so me getting in here was a big deal.

288
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:13,033
I hadn't even decided to come when I
found out they were throwing me a parade.

289
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,368
No wonder you get mail every day.

290
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:25,280
There've only been two times in my life
my father ever told me he was proud of me.

291
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,378
Fourth grade, I knocked out this bully
who'd been picking on me.

292
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,822
And the day I received
my acceptance here.

293
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,796
Hey, you guys looking at porn?

294
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,858
Yeah.

295
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,636
Someone explain why I can't hook up with
those girls until after my plebe year?

296
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,147
Hook up?
Oh, man, we can't even kiss 'em.

297
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,877
I'd explain it.
By giving your calc score today.

298
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:03,614
Hey, hey. I got 57. That's an F+.

299
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,555
- Huard got a G.
- Oh, man.

300
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,062
All right, all right.
Hey, relax, Huard. I'm just playing.

301
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,929
Hey, Huard. You gotta use more polish.
That's never gonna pass.

302
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,997
Worry about your own, Marianne.
I'll worry about mine.

303
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,528
You just don't get it, do you, Huard?
We're all tied together here.

304
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,939
- I don't need your help, Loo.
- Yeah, you do.

305
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,069
Hey, I know we're four guys in a shower,

306
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,012
but can we keep
the testosterone to a minimum?

307
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,710
Hey, Jake.
Help is like sex.

308
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,447
Take it from whoever
and whenever you can get it.

309
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,250
Nance, how's the cow?

310
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,851
Ma'am, she walks, she talks,
she's full of chalk.

311
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:49,161
The lactic fluid extracted from the female of
the bovine species is highly prolific to the...

312
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,600
fifth degree, ma'am.

313
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,902
- Good job, Nance. Serve yourself.
- Ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

314
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,872
I'll give you an easy one, rivet.

315
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,512
The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

316
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,145
- Sir, eight, sir.
- Are you sure?

317
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,355
'Cause you look
like you're guessing, Huard.

318
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,393
Sir, I'm sure, sir.

319
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,285
So you wouldn't have a problem

320
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,957
betting your companymates' dinner
on your answer?

321
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,159
Sir, no, sir.

322
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,566
What about their lives?

323
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,803
You said you were sure about the answer.

324
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,243
Well, if you're sure,
stakes shouldn't matter.

325
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:40,811
Loo. The Triton Light
has water from how many different seas?

326
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,820
Sir, seven, sir.

327
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,380
You just killed
everyone in your company, Huard.

328
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:53,023
Everyone scrape your plates
back onto the platter.

329
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,358
The worst officer is someone who guesses.

330
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,807
Someone who's too afraid to admit
that they don't know the right answer.

331
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,302
Those are the officers
who get people killed.

332
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,107
You bet everyone's meal, Huard.

333
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,919
Enjoy.

334
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,717
Sir, the uniform for noon meal formation
is Working Blues. Stripers carry swords.

335
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,883
The menu for the noon meal
is baked chicken, roast beef,

336
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,893
mashed potatoes, vegetables,
cannonballs and hard sauce.

337
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,361
You now have ten minutes, sir.

338
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,404
You don't stink so bad, Estrada.

339
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,805
- You been taking your showers?
- Sir, yes, sir!

340
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:15,903
All right, Estrada.
You can terminate Operation Disinfect.

341
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,847
Sir, aye aye, sir!

342
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,413
Carry on.

343
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,685
Finally, a goddamn night of sleep. Oorah!

344
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,365
Estrada, we need to talk.

345
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,130
- You mean talk, or talk talk?
- You lied to Whitaker.

346
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:46,701
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You didn't take a shower last night.

347
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,941
So what?

348
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:57,454
Look, man, I been taking those goddamn
showers every night for the past six weeks.

349
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,616
- So what if I missed one?
- You gotta turn yourself in.

350
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,660
Why?

351
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,457
'Cause Whitaker's a racist prick?

352
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,158
No, man.
I shouldn't have had to take those showers.

353
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,895
It's not the showers.
It's the first thing we learnt.

354
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:14,700
- Midshipmen are persons of integrity.
- Get off your soapbox, Loo!

355
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,967
Loo, it's a shower.
We can take care of this.

356
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,339
- You think I want to do this?
- Eat me, poster boy.

357
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,243
- Just tell the truth.
- Attention on deck!

358
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,759
- Is this room ready for inspection?
- Sir, yes, sir!

359
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,560
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

360
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,624
Loo.

361
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,568
Sir, I need to speak to you, sir.

362
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,402
You mother...

363
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,237
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

364
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,539
Hey, hey, hey! Loo. Loo.

365
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,738
Estrada, outside. Now.

366
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,394
- Come on, Huard.
- Let's go, Risa. You can do this.

367
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,164
We're gonna drown because of you, Risa.

368
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,472
You're crying?
Your ship is sinking and you're crying?

369
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,307
You're the reason
they say women don't belong here, Risa.

370
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,905
It's girls like you who give us a bad name.

371
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,885
- She gets the point, ma'am.
- What was that?

372
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,618
Ma'am, I said
I think she gets the point, ma'am.

373
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,226
Risa, out of the tank.

374
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,132
You got a problem with the way
this company's being run, Huard?

375
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,765
Sir, no, sir.

376
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:03,542
You've got enough problems of your own
without worrying about Risa's.

377
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,179
You want to hit me, Huard?

378
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:13,089
- Go ahead.
- Cole, this is my drill. I'll handle it.

379
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,884
All right, gentlemen. That's enough.

380
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,718
Nice work, there, Cole.
Nice work. I like that.

381
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,322
So you all think you're Rocky Marciano

382
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:53,524
'cause you can tag your roommate
with a weak-ass right.

383
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,158
So I had your commanding officer
come in here today

384
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,203
to show you what real boxing is about,

385
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,569
'cause if you make Brigades
next semester,

386
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,131
that right there
is what you'll be looking at.

387
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,905
Midshipman Cole
looks like he can go another round.

388
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,709
- What do you say, Midshipman?
- Let's do it.

389
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,807
Uh-oh.

390
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,751
Anybody want to come in here with him?

391
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,118
Huh?

392
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:22,148
I hope you're this quiet
when you're sneaking up on the enemy.

393
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,251
Loo.

394
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,627
Loo. How about you?

395
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:32,533
You and your mouth were Golden Gloves
champ at 185 in San Diego.

396
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,628
Come on, champ.

397
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:40,075
Sir, I would, sir, but I don't want
to give away my secrets until the Brigades.

398
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,203
Pussy.

399
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,240
Come on.

400
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:48,843
This man has been making your life
miserable for the last two months.

401
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,415
It's your chance for a little payback.
Anybody gonna come in here with him?

402
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,221
I'll do it.

403
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,626
- You're not in his weight class, Huard.
- I'll wear an extra T-shirt.

404
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,802
You're not in his class class, either.

405
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,481
- Come on, son.
- All right, yeah!

406
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,849
All right, Jake. You can do it.
You can do it, Jake.

407
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,925
- Sure you want to do this, Huard?
- Yes, sir.

408
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,591
All right, gentlemen. Let's box.

409
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,072
All right, all right. It's a slip.

410
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,114
It's OK. It's OK, Jake.
It's OK, Jake.

411
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,676
Let's box.

412
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,633
This ain't one of them smokers
from the shipyard, Huard.

413
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,571
All right. You all right, son?
Let's go.

414
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,303
Come on, man.
Stay in there. Stay in there, Jake.

415
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,847
All right, all right, that's it.
That's it. That's it.

416
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,987
Hope you didn't bet
anybody's meal on this.

417
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,619
All right, that's it.
Get his gloves off.

418
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,290
Boy's got heart, which is more
than I can say for all of y'all. But heart...

419
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,356
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,459
- Let him go.
- Show some discipline.

421
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,197
- Let him go.
- Get out of the ring.

422
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:51,173
Set an example for these plebes.
Settle down. Now!

423
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,739
Get your gear off.

424
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,147
All right.

425
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:10,281
147 to go.

426
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,858
- When are you taking off?
- I'm not.

427
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,726
I gotta stay
and work on my time for the O-course.

428
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,030
And, to be honest, I'm afraid
if I walk out of here, I won't come back.

429
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:30,703
So, you have a good Christmas.
I'll see you after leave.

430
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,836
Hey, Huard?

431
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,011
I said, I'll see you after leave.

432
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,682
Sir, yes, sir.

433
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,341
Hey, how are you?

434
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,424
Hey, it's Popeye the Sailor Man.

435
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,030
Easy, easy, easy...

436
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,296
- Cheers!
- To Jake.

437
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,932
- It's great to have you back.
- That's right.

438
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,812
You say they kicked some guy out
for not taking a shower?

439
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,246
Yeah. Yeah, they threw a couple out
for hooking up with girls, too.

440
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,252
That sounds like bullshit to me, man.
I don't know why you put up with that crap.

441
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,687
Well, it's not a job. It's an adventure.

442
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,418
I'll drink to that.

443
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,394
I'll drink to that.

444
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,862
I'll drink to you drinking to that.

445
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:14,871
Hey.

446
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,946
The fight's about to start. You hungry?

447
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,510
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

448
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,456
So AJ said you guys
are a couple weeks behind.

449
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:35,192
- Yeah, a little.
- I was wondering if you could use me.

450
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,133
Well, I don't have any short time stuff.

451
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,039
Yeah, well, I wasn't really
thinking about short time stuff.

452
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,738
Are you sure this is what you want?

453
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,375
OK.

454
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:06,053
I'll talk to Mike tomorrow.
See what we can work out.

455
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,620
Thanks.

456
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,030
Should be a good fight.

457
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:28,243
So I told Mike you would meet him
over at Sir Frankie's at five.

458
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,187
Ah, that's all right.
I think I'm just gonna go home.

459
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,247
What?

460
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,692
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm just tired.

461
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,938
So how much did you collect?

462
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,310
It's just for shits and giggles, man.

463
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,941
How much?

464
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,986
A little over 500.

465
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:12,392
What's up?
AJ leave early or something?

466
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,967
You all right?

467
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:25,503
What kind of father
wants his own son to fail?

468
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,170
- What are you talking about?
- You gave me my job back.

469
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,839
- You asked for it back.
- And you said yes.

470
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,043
- This is a good thing here.
- Yeah, not for me.

471
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:37,884
You knew how bad I wanted to go
to the academy. You never said anything.

472
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:43,120
Why? Would it kill you
that I might actually do better than you?

473
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:48,096
You want the truth? I didn't want you to go
over there because I knew this'd happen.

474
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:52,795
You'd be back here,
pissed off 'cause you didn't make it.

475
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:59,034
Look, Jake, I know you promised
your mother that you'd go to the academy.

476
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,942
And you tried, but it just didn't work out.

477
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:07,109
Yeah. Maybe it would have
if she was the one who was still around.

478
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:13,717
Look, I know I haven't been the best father.

479
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:19,188
And you can blame me for a lot of things,
but this ain't one of them,

480
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:24,997
'cause when it's all said and done,
I didn't quit. You did, Jake.

481
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,723
- What are you doing here?
- You know, just scoping out johns.

482
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,151
You want a beer?

483
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,129
Nah.

484
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,358
How's your leave been?

485
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,266
It's been a blast. How's yours?

486
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,397
OK.

487
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,738
You looking forward to heading back?

488
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,408
Come on.
I thought you were gonna dance with me.

489
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:01,497
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I cut in?

490
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,510
This is nice.

491
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,879
I don't think I've danced since high school.

492
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,951
- No spring dances at the academy?
- No.

493
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,353
Uh-uh. Never gone.

494
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,221
Yeah, you can tell.

495
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,761
Really? Says the guy
who keep stepping on my foot.

496
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,820
Ow!

497
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,365
Sorry.

498
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,601
Why don't you go to the dances?

499
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:48,239
Some guys at the academy
don't view women as their equals.

500
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,213
It's worse if you start dating them.

501
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,813
It's no fun being underestimated, is it?

502
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,715
It's worse when you do it to yourself.

503
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,260
Excuse me.

504
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,537
I will see you tomorrow, Plebe Huard.

505
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,276
Watch your feet.

506
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,194
- Delta Company.
- Sir.

507
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:48,762
One missing and unaccounted for.
Midshipman Fourth Class Butcher.

508
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,736
- Echo Company.
- Sir, two missing and unaccounted for.

509
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,079
Midshipman Fourth Class Casarico,

510
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,141
Midshipman Fourth Class Huard.

511
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:12,619
Ma'am, Midshipman Fourth Class Huard
is present and accounted for, ma'am.

512
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:26,806
- In case you forgot, we wear uniform here.
- Sir, yes, sir.

513
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,438
- Put yourself on report.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

514
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:43,086
- Memorial Hall in ten, Huard.
- Sir, aye aye, sir.

515
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,435
Dead at 23.

516
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,549
The best officer I ever served under.

517
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,584
I'm sorry about your friend, sir.

518
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,623
Why? He's not.

519
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,921
Why are you here, Huard?

520
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,790
To serve my country, sir.

521
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,732
You say that here...

522
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,729
where people actually died
for their country.

523
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,269
You don't think I took Psych 101?

524
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,245
You're here to answer the question
that's gnawed at you

525
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:42,945
ever since you saw this place
from across the river.

526
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,818
Well, let me spare you the suspense.

527
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,691
You ain't good enough.

528
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,159
I've heard that my whole life.

529
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,659
But I'm still here.

530
00:48:56,266 --> 00:49:01,499
All the other company commanders here,
they're playing soldier.

531
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,633
But I've been a soldier, Huard.

532
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,969
I've seen what good officers are like.

533
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,983
And I know what bad officers are like.

534
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:20,445
So there ain't no way
I'm letting someone finish this year

535
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,721
who's not worthy of this academy.

536
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,661
I'm not quitting.

537
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:35,168
Wakey wakey!
Come on, Loo. Move, butterball!

538
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,942
Plebe Huard.
How many missiles are the Ohio class

539
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,911
of ballistic missile submarines
capable of carrying?

540
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,538
Sir, I'll find out, sir.

541
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:52,355
Who was the youngest midshipman,
and how old was he?

542
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,923
Sir, I'll find out, sir.

543
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,325
I'm sure you will, Huard.

544
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,863
Keep filling.

545
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,467
Stop.

546
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,145
Congratulations, Loo.

547
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:22,310
You can join Huard
on marching tours this weekend.

548
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:24,644
Carry on.

549
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,019
Understand this.

550
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:32,255
When Plebe Huard
doesn't know his rates, none of you do.

551
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:36,824
A company is only as strong
as its weakest plebe.

552
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:53,709
You should get out too, Nance.
He's just gonna drag you down.

553
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,050
He's right, you know.

554
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,621
Can I borrow your starch?

555
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,753
Look, I don't get it.
Why are you still here?

556
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,963
- You want to know why I stay in this room?
- Yeah.

557
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:14,197
'Cause, Jake, you're my Mississippi.

558
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,032
I'm your what?

559
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,009
People who live in Arkansas,
you know what their favorite state is?

560
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,204
No.

561
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,579
Mississippi. 'Cause Mississippi's
the only thing that keeps Arkansas

562
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,177
from being the worst state
in the whole country.

563
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:35,088
- I'm Mississippi.
- Well, you sure as hell ain't California.

564
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,093
Listen, Cole and Whitaker
are so busy trying to run you out

565
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,629
they forgot all about me.

566
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:47,728
As a matter of fact, they've forgotten about
every other plebe in this whole company.

567
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:52,571
That's why I stay in this room, Jake.
'Cause if Mississippi quits,

568
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:57,739
then all of a sudden Arkansas
is the worst state in the whole country.

569
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,448
Hey, where's my starch?

570
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,146
- All right.
- Come on, chop chop.

571
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,526
You're looking good, Huard.

572
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,229
Pretty soon you'll be able
to keep up with my six-year-old daughter.

573
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,033
When can I start boxing again, sir?

574
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:25,904
When I make admiral.

575
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:31,073
You knew better than to pull
that mess you pulled in my ring, son.

576
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,115
Eyes on the ring.

577
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:44,217
Brigades Tournament
begins in eight weeks.

578
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,854
Training starts this Friday.

579
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:52,334
Brigades is the biggest event
in this academy all year. You know why?

580
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:58,068
Because the boxing ring is the only place
in this academy where everybody's equal.

581
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:01,804
Doesn't matter what your rank is,
how many stripes you got,

582
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:07,180
the only thing that is guaranteed
when you step inside these ropes:

583
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,548
You're gonna find out who you are.

584
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,631
This doesn't look like your room.

585
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,265
What are you doing here, Huard?

586
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,502
I'm training for the Brigades, sir.

587
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:38,279
All right, Huard.

588
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,339
Let's see how you're doing.

589
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,347
Sir?

590
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,911
Show me how
you're gonna win the Brigades.

591
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,323
Ding ding.

592
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,259
Don't worry, Huard.
I'm not your company officer in here.

593
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:58,460
I'm just a guy
looking to punch you in the mouth.

594
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:03,802
Well, you can take a punch.
I guess we knew that already, didn't we?

595
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,973
You can actually land a punch, too.

596
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,344
- You're pretty good, Huard.
- Thanks.

597
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,411
Against a 36-year-old
out-of-shape lieutenant.

598
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,526
Not bad, Huard.

599
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:39,405
You know, most of the boxers in the
Brigades are nationally ranked amateurs.

600
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,809
Think you're gonna beat 'em
by hitting the bag for a couple hours?

601
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,870
I'll do what I have to.

602
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:48,111
Really? Without anyone training you?

603
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,883
You think you're gonna be the first plebe
to get through here without anyone's help?

604
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,356
I don't need anyone's help.

605
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,698
No one thinks I'll make it anyway.

606
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:20,245
Who do you think convinced the board
to take a chance on you?

607
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:31,518
This ain't the shipyard, Huard. You can't
just will yourself through this place.

608
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,882
Sorry. I'll be done in a minute.

609
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:11,265
Here. Recent studies show that auditory
retention surpasses that of visual retention.

610
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,360
OK.

611
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:17,998
OK. Turn off the light
so I can get some sleep.

612
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,937
<i>What is the latitude of Annapolis?</i>

613
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,246
<i>The latitude of Annapolis is 38.58º north.</i>

614
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,411
Thanks.

615
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,625
- Ma'am.
- Plebe Huard.

616
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,322
- Everything OK?
- Yes, ma'am.

617
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,067
You know I'm training for the Brigades.

618
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,403
That's great, Huard. Good luck.

619
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,704
Maybe we could work out together.

620
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,940
Uh, no. I think I'm already
in pretty good shape, thanks.

621
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,345
Ma'am.

622
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,181
I need your help.

623
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,177
What? Think you're gonna be
all alone in that ring?

624
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,246
Come on. Come on.

625
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,755
- Let's go.
- Come on.

626
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,373
- Damn it.
- Come on.

627
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,306
Before you achieve, you must believe.

628
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,438
Let's go, Arkansas.

629
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,155
Come on, Huard.
I've seen better footwork at Payless.

630
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,700
Come on, get back in there.

631
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,066
Better footwork at Payless?

632
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,523
- Jake.
- What?

633
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,763
You're trying to get into
Cole's weight class, right?

634
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,667
Yeah.

635
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,672
What's this?

636
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,839
Well, you're not gonna get there
by just eating the stuff they serve you here.

637
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:15,874
What you need, my friend, is the patented
Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

638
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,819
which, I'm proud to say,

639
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:25,384
has been perfected
after 18 years of dedicated research.

640
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,790
- So you're gonna get me to 185?
- Hey.

641
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,768
I'm not only the president
of the Marcus Nance North Beach Diet,

642
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:36,236
I'm also a client.

643
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,825
Come on, get down in the mud.
Come on. Come on, buddy.

644
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,804
Up, up. Over, over.
Go, Arkansas. Come on.

645
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:10,964
Let me see you run.

646
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,776
<i> How long have you been</i>
<i>in the Navy? All my bloomin' life.</i>

647
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:25,586
Just hook it over and we're done.
Hook it over and we're done. Here we go.

648
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,292
What happened to all my ball machines?

649
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,599
- Come on, Huard. Dance for me.
- Hit me once and you can talk like that.

650
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,168
- I have. I think I hit you about five times.
- Ooh!

651
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,578
Make that six, Huard.

652
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:04,292
Three. That's three. Gimme one more.

653
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:07,329
That was for momma.
Gimme one for daddy. Get up there.

654
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,059
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you want it?

655
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,511
Not quite there, huh?

656
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,209
Come on. How bad do you want it?

657
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:08,254
OK, that's good. Stop.

658
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,033
I never could have done it.

659
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,269
What?

660
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:34,976
Made it through plebe year
if I could see my home every day.

661
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:42,649
Well, if I couldn't see it every day,
I probably would have quit a long time ago.

662
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:51,428
You know, my mom
used to take me out here.

663
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,526
We had a Sunfish.

664
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,935
We'd park it down there.

665
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:05,373
She was the only person
who ever believed I'd make it here.

666
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,144
She must be very proud of you.

667
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,817
She would be.

668
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,989
I'm sorry.

669
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21,326
She's what's getting you through?

670
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:27,197
Well... She's what got me here.

671
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:33,038
But she's not the one
who's getting me through.

672
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,748
Matt Cole, 197.

673
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,726
All right, Midshipman. You step down.

674
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,289
Anybody else for heavyweight?

675
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:03,095
- All right, I guess that's it, then.
- One more heavyweight.

676
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,038
- Huard, what are you doing?
- Weighing in.

677
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,515
Jump rope contest is next week.
My daughter's looking forward to it.

678
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,678
- Anybody else?
- Sir.

679
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,018
You said the Brigades
were open to all midshipmen.

680
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,183
I want to fight.

681
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,535
Fine. I'm gonna draw up a permission slip
for your parents to sign. Hit the scales.

682
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,756
Jake Huard, 185.

683
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,300
Next up, heavyweight division:

684
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,136
Midshipman Loo
versus Midshipman Huard.

685
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:22,302
- Let's go.
- Loo! Loo! Loo! Loo!

686
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:32,582
You both received your instructions
in the dressing rooms.

687
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,089
I want you to keep it clean.
Any questions?

688
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,489
Payback's a bitch, Huard.

689
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:45,258
You set the pace out there, Huard.

690
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,284
Come on, Jake. One more.

691
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,260
Hmm? Come on, hit me one time.

692
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,891
One, two, three,

693
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,905
four, five, six, seven,

694
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,441
eight, nine, ten.

695
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,840
You're out.

696
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:34,777
What is the latitude of Annapolis?

697
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,718
- Who were the first three admirals?
- How long have you been in the Navy?

698
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:43,157
Sir, the latitude of Annapolis
is 38.58º north.

699
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,752
Sir, the first three admirals
were Dewey, Porter and Farragut.

700
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,559
Sir, I've been in the Navy
all my bloomin' life, sir.

701
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,066
My mother's a mermaid,
my father's King Neptune.

702
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:56,298
Every bone in my body is a spar.
And when I spits, I spits tar.

703
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,966
I's hard, I is, I am, I are.

704
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,605
All right. Everybody on your feet.

705
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,411
Everyone but Huard is dismissed.

706
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,224
How about some more up-downs, Huard?

707
01:08:50,025 --> 01:08:54,758
What? I'm a plebe. I love rolling
on the ground and freezing my ass off.

708
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:02,127
Y'all trying to make me proud
out here tonight, huh?

709
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,070
- Oorah!
- Oorah!

710
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,675
- Oorah!
- Oorah!

711
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,613
Good. Time.

712
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,381
- Nicely done, Huard.
- Thank you.

713
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:25,954
Good job. Your left hook's getting there.

714
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,526
- It's getting there?
- Mm-hm.

715
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,930
- But it's not there yet?
- Not yet.

716
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,992
- Really?
- Almost.

717
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:38,097
- Why don't you show me? There.
- OK.

718
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,165
- Not bad.
- All right.

719
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:43,405
- Show me how to...
- It's just... the little things.

720
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:47,540
Like, really get your weight behind it.
You know what I mean?

721
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:51,211
Ooh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.

722
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,618
Oh...

723
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,715
- Jeez.
- Let me see. No, it's OK. I'm sorry.

724
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,555
- Is it bleeding?
- Uh-uh.

725
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,618
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.

726
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:09,366
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

727
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:13,169
- I'm OK.
- No, I mean about...

728
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,803
About stopping.

729
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,280
Oh.

730
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,943
Well, why are you sorry?
I was the one who stopped.

731
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,884
What did you say?

732
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,890
It was getting a little hot.
I had to push you away.

733
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:35,261
You know what? I think I hit you
over the head a little too hard there, Jake.

734
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,838
One, two, three, four,

735
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,745
five, six, seven,

736
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,046
eight, nine, ten.

737
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,813
You're out!

738
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,060
You OK?

739
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,423
Nice smile, Huard.

740
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,732
Can't wait to see
what Cole does to it in the finals.

741
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,897
Good fight.

742
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,132
No way.

743
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:25,170
It's impressive, to be able to say
you helped build something like this.

744
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,888
Take ten.

745
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,736
Hey.

746
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,332
The ship looks great.

747
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,001
Yeah, it might float.

748
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,614
So, I know you're probably busy, but...

749
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,584
I have a fight next week. Saturday.

750
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:14,850
It's the finals in the Brigades.
It's for the whole academy.

751
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,391
We're still a little behind.

752
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,450
Yeah. I get it.

753
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,860
All right.

754
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,628
I guess I'll see you soon.

755
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,603
Yeah, sure.

756
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:34,233
- Take care of yourself.
- All right. You too.

757
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:46,816
The required time for plebes
is five minutes.

758
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:52,020
Failure to meet that requirement
will result in separation.

759
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,927
There will be no retest.

760
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,988
Good luck.

761
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,151
Keep going.

762
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,332
This is nothing.
You're there. You're there.

763
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:38,364
Put it over. Put it over.
Hook it over.

764
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:43,575
Come on. You got it.
Come on, duck down. You got it.

765
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,637
Come on, that's it. Let's go. Let's go.

766
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,706
That's it. You got it.

767
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:54,021
Come on, Twins.
Show Whitaker. Show him. Let's go.

768
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:57,581
Yeah! That's it.
Last one. Last one.

769
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:16,672
- Nice! Good job, Nance.
- Good job, man.

770
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,576
Nance.

771
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:22,640
5:04. You're four seconds over.

772
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:29,749
Sir, give him another chance.
He can make it.

773
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,055
5:04 is 5:04.

774
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:36,393
It's four seconds.
You know how far he's come?

775
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,948
Hey.

776
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,854
They gave me the key to the city.
You know that?

777
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:14,129
You think I have to give it back?

778
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:18,436
Hey, this isn't over.
We can talk to Burton.

779
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:23,775
Remember how I told you about
that bully I beat up in the fourth grade?

780
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,608
Mm-hm.

781
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:33,913
Truth is, he tripped when he hit me
and knocked himself out on the pavement.

782
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,923
Next day, he kicked the crap outta me
till I cried like a baby...

783
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:42,828
All right, come on, Arkansas.
You can't do this to yourself.

784
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,092
I let 'em down.
I let my parents down...

785
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,038
You didn't let anyone down. We're gonna
work this out. It's gonna be fine...

786
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,268
Just stop it, Jake! OK?

787
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,243
It's over.

788
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,105
I don't belong here, OK?

789
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,515
You belong here.

790
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,723
I just need some time alone, all right?

791
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:11,784
OK.

792
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,258
All right.

793
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,118
Switch.

794
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:55,059
Thanks.

795
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,468
You're ready, man.

796
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,676
Somebody jumped.

797
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:31,034
He's still breathing.
Go get some help.

798
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:44,946
Jake! Get him off. Get him off!
Get off, Jake. Get up.

799
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,079
- You did this!
- Jake, take it easy.

800
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:50,090
- You happy?
- Cool off. Cool off, Jake, come on.

801
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,991
Take it easy. Just take it easy.
It's not worth it, man.

802
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,757
Cool off, man. You gotta cool off.

803
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,012
So you're quitting?

804
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:56,216
What about your review board?

805
01:19:56,291 --> 01:20:00,921
I hit my superior officer.
We both know how it's gonna end.

806
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:08,131
I asked for more time
to prepare my statement for the board.

807
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:13,272
Your appearance
has been moved to Monday.

808
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,775
After the Brigade finals.

809
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,113
I'm giving you
what you wanted all year, Huard.

810
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,879
Hey.

811
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,044
Hey.

812
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:06,718
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.

813
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,061
Jake.

814
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,159
Yeah?

815
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,400
What time's the fight?

816
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:22,503
There are more important things
than the fight right now.

817
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,105
Listen, Jake. We're both lucky.

818
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,782
We got second chances.

819
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:37,556
I'm not gonna waste mine.

820
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,827
Neither are you.

821
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,264
When you step in that ring,
you have three rounds

822
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,237
to find out who you are.

823
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:58,037
Show 'em who you are, Mississippi.

824
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:29,768
Hey, rivet!

825
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,807
Don't let me down. I got money on you.

826
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,678
OK. Here we go.

827
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:48,086
Good luck.

828
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:55,054
Here we go.

829
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:03,468
OK. Fighters to the centre.

830
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:10,072
OK, gentlemen. You received
my instructions in the dressing room.

831
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:13,581
Obey my commands. Touch gloves.

832
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,215
Come on, Jake!

833
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:33,198
- All right, let's go, Huard.
- Come on, Jake.

834
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,361
Wreck this guy, Cole.

835
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,768
Watch that jab.

836
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:43,103
Come on, Huard. Step around.

837
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:47,581
This kid Cole is probably
my best recruit in the last ten years.

838
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,714
Playtime's over.

839
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,549
- He's gotta pace himself.
- Attack him!

840
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:59,760
- That's it.
- He's gotta slow it down.

841
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,822
Here we go. Yes!

842
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:08,635
Put him down. Put him down!

843
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:14,066
- That's right.
- Oh, my God.

844
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,303
Where's your smile now,
Huard?

845
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:21,580
One, two, three...

846
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,310
- Take the count.
...four...

847
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:27,787
- Get up, Jake.
...five, six, seven, eight.

848
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,117
Attaboy, Jake.

849
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,050
Box.

850
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,154
Here we go, baby.

851
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:39,761
Stick and move. Stick and move.

852
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,961
Put him down. Put him down.

853
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,507
Stay off the ropes, Huard.

854
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:53,603
Break. Break, break, break.

855
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,846
Defense, Jake. Hands up.

856
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:06,321
Get outta that corner.
Get outta the corner!

857
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,633
Break. Break!

858
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,709
All right. Take a deep breath.
Relax. You OK?

859
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,772
Relax, you got this. OK, come on.

860
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,717
Remember,
you're boxing in there, not brawling.

861
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:35,620
Look at me, Jake. Look at me.
I want you to watch him, OK?

862
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,352
Keep your hands up.
Make him come to you.

863
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:41,395
You hear that?
You are dominating this fight.

864
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:45,125
You're the champ, OK? Two more rounds,
baby. Finish off this prick.

865
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,933
- All right? Do not charge him.
- Let's go, Jake.

866
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,930
Come on, Jake. Come on, let's go.

867
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:57,267
Box.

868
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,251
Be patient. Just let him come to you.

869
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,416
Here we go.

870
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,528
- Put him down.
- Stay off the ropes, Jake. Come on.

871
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,667
How's your man Huard doing,
Lieutenant?

872
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,400
Come on, Cole.

873
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,412
Come on, Huard. Let's go.

874
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,783
Move in on him, Jakey.

875
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,227
- Yeah, Huard.
- No, no, attack him.

876
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,231
- Get off the ropes.
- Yeah.

877
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,897
Watch it. Watch out, Jake,
you're leaving yourself open.

878
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:00,839
- Hands up. Hands up!
- Careful.

879
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:32,656
Touch gloves.

880
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:37,769
- You've got this.
- Go, Cole. He's got nothing left.

881
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:40,373
Let's go, Jake.

882
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,459
That's it, Jake.
Make him come to you.

883
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:11,496
- Nice. Nice!
- Nice, Jake!

884
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:14,541
- Cole, get outta there.
- Go! Yes!

885
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,407
- Yeah! Stay down.
- Yeah, Jake!

886
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,475
- One, two...
- Get up, man.

887
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:27,043
You're the champ. Come on.

888
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:32,650
...five, six, seven, eight.
- He wants some more!

889
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,160
Box.

890
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,294
There you go! Step around.

891
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,506
Here we go.

892
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,308
You got him, Jake. This is your time.

893
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,408
- Cole! Come on!
- Yes!

894
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,578
What the hell are you doing?

895
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,884
- Come on, Huard.
- Work him. He's going down.

896
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:04,789
Just work the body.

897
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,793
Let's go. 30 seconds.

898
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,794
Go for it.

899
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:12,958
Come on, Jake.

900
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:20,574
He's getting tired, Jake.
You've gotta go for it. Go for it.

901
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,438
20 seconds, Huard.

902
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,808
Come on, Huard. Yeah!

903
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,613
Keep your rhythm. Keep your rhythm.

904
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:30,310
Get outta the corner.

905
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:33,752
Ten seconds, Jake.
You gotta take him out now.

906
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:35,311
Come on, Huard.

907
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,450
- Go after him, Jake.
- Go, go, go!

908
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,663
Break. Break.

909
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,369
Great fight, Jake.

910
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,242
Yeah, that kid Huard's a tough kid.

911
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:05,885
- Go on, Jake!
- That's my boy right there.

912
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:08,285
That's my boy.

913
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:14,586
OK. Fighters to the centre.

914
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:17,495
Fighters to the centre. Let's go.

915
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:33,741
- Out the way.
- Let me get a shot.

916
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,985
Sorry, man.

917
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,682
I told you. Hell of a fight.

918
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:47,023
Yeah, number one, baby.
Yeah, number one.

919
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,464
You did great.

920
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:09,807
- Good job, man.
- Good job, Huard.

921
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,980
- Good job, man.
- Good job, Jake. Good fight.

922
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:48,649
Midshipman Huard, please stand.

923
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:58,626
Mr. Huard, this review board
finds you guilty of insubordination.

924
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:00,690
Sir, yes, sir.

925
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:06,997
However, based on the recommendation
of your company commander,

926
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:10,168
this board has decided to retain you.

927
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:15,807
Your punishment
will be 95 days' restriction and 95 demerits.

928
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:19,717
Punishment will commence immediately
upon your return from summer cruise.

929
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,982
Is that understood?

930
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,484
Sir, yes, sir.

931
01:34:37,938 --> 01:34:40,736
Congratulations, Midshipman Huard.

932
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,003
Thank you, sir.

933
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:48,345
Class of 2008.

934
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:53,583
Congratulations.
You just completed your plebe year.

935
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,214
Plebes no more!

936
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:58,956
Your summer leave starts...

937
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:04,321
Now!

938
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,570
Three more years, man.

939
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:27,811
I'll see you, man.

940
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:32,484
- Congratulations, Jake.
- Thank you, ma'am.

941
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,087
- Any plans before your summer cruise?
- Uh, yeah.

942
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:40,429
I think I might go over to Sir Frankie's
and see if there are any escorts around.

943
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:41,991
- Really?
- Yeah.

944
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,401
Save your money.

945
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,273
- Plebes no more.
- Plebes no more.

946
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:56,612
- I'll see you at Sir Frankie's.
- You got it.

947
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,730
Sir.

948
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:17,003
I want to thank you.

949
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:20,905
- For what?
- For helping me with the review board.

950
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:25,576
It wasn't about you, Huard.
That was about this academy.

951
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,911
Good luck out there.

952
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,518
Sir.

953
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:45,192
What do you think would have happened
if that fight went another round?

954
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:48,292
You really want to find out?

955
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,803
Come join me in the Marines.
