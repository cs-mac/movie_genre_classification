1
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,906
- Come in.

2
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,811
Mr. Spencer. Mr. Spencer,
I hate to bother you...

3
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,481
but I thought
you'd like to know
there were two men here.

4
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,490
Two men askin' for you.

5
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,425
Ayoung man
and a kind of older man.

6
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,463
They was sorry
you wasn't in.
I said you wasn't.

7
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,797
Did they say they'd be back?
They didn't say exactly,
but I think they will.

8
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:52,929
Just now, when I had to go
down to the store, I seen them
standing there at the corner.

9
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,372
Maybe I shoulda let
them in, only you said
not to disturb you...

10
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:59,275
Yes?
And I'm sure
they'll be back.

11
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,314
You look kinda tired to me,
and that's a fact.

12
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,646
You got a headache
or somethin'?

13
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,244
I think maybe
you need a real rest.
That's what I think.

14
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,189
Why, Mr. Spencer.
You oughtn't to leave all that
money lying around like that.

15
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,886
Oh, it makes me nervous
to see money lying around.

16
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,088
Everybody in the world
ain't honest, you know.

17
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,688
Though I must say
I haven't had
much trouble that way.

18
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:24,362
Those friends of yours
told me not to mention
they'd called.

19
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,998
Wanted to surprise you.
But I thought you'd like
to know somehow.

20
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,838
Yes, yes. Of course.
If they come back,
you may show them in.

21
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,402
Yes.
You know, Mrs. Martin,
it's very funny.

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,847
They aren't exactly
friends of mine.
They've never seen me.

23
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,045
That's odd, isn't it?
'Tis odd,
like you say.

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,989
And now that I'm here,
I'll have to meet them.

25
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,120
I may even go out
and meet them.

26
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:53,529
And then again,
I may not. Not yet.

27
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,934
You go ahead with your nap.
I'll pull down the blind.

28
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,671
What do you know? You're bluffing.
You've nothing on me.

29
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,483
Hello, Postal Union?
I want to send a telegram...

30
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,894
to Mrs. Joseph Newton
in Santa Rosa, California.

31
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,490
Here's the message.
Ready?

32
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,900
Lonesome for you all.
Stop.

33
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,463
Am coming out to stay
with you awhile. Stop.

34
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,840
Will arrive Thursday
and try and stop me.

35
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,846
Will wire exact time later.

36
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,144
Love to you all...

37
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:01,710
and a kiss for little Charlie
from her Uncle Charlie.

38
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,157
That's right.
That's the signature.
"Uncle Charlie."

39
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,819
That's right. Santa Rosa.

40
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,563
Santa Rosa, California.

41
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,263
Ann, answer the telephone.

42
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,963
Newton's residence.
Ann Newton speaking.

43
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,934
Oh, hello, Mrs. Henderson.
This is Ann.

44
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,403
Mother isn't home yet.

45
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,999
A telegram? Well...

46
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,102
I don't see a pencil, so maybe
she better call you back.

47
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,444
I'm trying to keep my mind
free of things
that don't matter...

48
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,917
because I have so much
to keep on my mind.

49
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,181
Innumerable things.

50
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,622
I'll have her call back.
Thank you for calling.

51
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,625
Good-bye.

52
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,925
Hello, Ann.
Where's your mother?

53
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,935
She's out.
Out?

54
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,131
Mrs. Henderson just called
from the Postal Union Office.

55
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,140
She says we have a telegram.

56
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,644
I would have taken it down,
only I couldn't find a pencil.
I looked.

57
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,975
Telegram, eh?

58
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:13,246
I knew there'd be trouble
if your Aunt Sarah got
her driver's license.

59
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,015
Whereabouts was
the accident?
I didn't take notes.

60
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,613
Oh. Then how about a kiss?

61
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,492
Isn't that the funniest thing?
Here I am,
practically a child...

62
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,625
and I wouldn't read
the things you read.

63
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,329
Mm-hmm. Well, I guess
they'd give you bad dreams.

64
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,500
Bad dreams?
You don't understand, Papa.
Mystery stories have done...

65
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,736
Where's Roger?
Out. The average mind...

66
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,769
Where's Charlie?
Out. No, I mean she's upstairs
in her room thinking.

67
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,112
Well, don't read too much.
You'll ruin your eyes.

68
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,119
And leave my book alone.
What's that you're reading?

69
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,247
Ivanhoe.
Hmm? Oh.

70
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,364
Who is it?
It's me.

71
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,865
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

72
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,339
No. I'm perfectly well.

73
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:14,209
I've just been thinking
for hours, and I've come
to the conclusion I give up.

74
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,680
I simply give up.
What are you going
to give up?

75
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,651
Have you ever stopped to think
that a family should be the most
wonderful thing in the world?

76
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,245
And that this family's
just gone to pieces?

77
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,291
We have?
Of course we have.

78
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:31,661
We just sort of go along
and nothing happens.
We're in a terrible rut.

79
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:36,065
It's been on my mind for months.
What's going to be our future?

80
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,502
Oh, come now, Charlie.
Things aren't
as bad as that.

81
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,905
The bank gave me a raise
last January.
Money.

82
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,934
How can you talk about money
when I'm talking about souls?

83
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,982
We eat and sleep
and that's about all.

84
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,313
We don't even have
any real conversations.

85
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,649
Wejust talk.
And work.

86
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,156
Yes. Poor Mother.
She works like a dog.

87
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,216
Just like a dog.
Where is she?

88
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:05,252
She's out. When she comes back,
it'll be the same thing.

89
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:10,394
Dinner, then dishes, then bed.
I don't see how she stands it.

90
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,202
You know, she's really
a wonderful woman.

91
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,801
I mean, she's not just a mother.
And I think we ought
to do something for her.

92
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,473
Don't you think we should?
Yeah. What were you thinking
of doing for her?

93
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:26,917
Oh, nothing, I suppose.

94
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,318
I guess we'll just have to wait
for a miracle or something.

95
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,482
Oh, now, Charlie,
you're right.
Absolutely right.

96
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:37,393
- I'll figure out some way...
- Oh, I don't believe
in good intentions anymore.

97
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,126
All I'm waiting for now
is a miracle.
Oh, Charlie.

98
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,395
Those back stairs
are steep.

99
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,131
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's the matter, Joe?

100
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,505
Well, it seems that, uh...
Oh, I've become
a nagging old maid.

101
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,841
And you went downtown
in that awful old hat
you promised you'd throw away.

102
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,076
Darling, what does it matter
what hat I put on?

103
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,915
Mama.
Mother, I don't see why
you let that child yell at you.

104
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,682
If she...
I'm going
downstairs anyway.

105
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,589
Joe, what were you
both talking about
when I came in?

106
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,593
Something about a miracle.

107
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,152
Oh, it's nothing. Charlie's
a bit under the weather.

108
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,221
Oh. Well, she'll be all right.

109
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,065
Well, come on, dear.
Let's go downstairs.
No use standing here.

110
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,866
I'm going to get myself
a bottle of beer.

111
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,930
Mother, I'm going downtown
and send a telegram.

112
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,305
Why, darling,
who do you know
to send a telegram to?

113
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,005
I know a wonderful person
who'll come and shake us up.
Just the one to save us.

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,378
What do you mean,
"save us"?

115
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,509
All this time, there's been
one right person to save us.

116
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,886
- Mother, what's
Uncle Charlie's address?
- Uncle Charlie?

117
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,653
- Now, you're not going to ask
him for money, are you?
- Of course not.

118
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,662
That wouldn't help us.
What's his address?
The last address I had...

119
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,664
Do you know
how many steps
I had to take...

120
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,597
to get from here
to the drugstore
and back?

121
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:53,195
649.
No. If you've forgotten,
I'm not going to tell you.

122
00:12:55,107 --> 00:13:00,010
I remember. Philadelphia.
You can't ask a busy man to come
all this way for nothing.

123
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,445
He'll come for me.
I'm named after him.

124
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,006
Besides, we're
the only relatives
he has in the world.

125
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,178
If you come all the way
up Fourth Street, it's 802.

126
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:12,623
Mama, guess what?
I have no time for guessing.
What's that thing in your hair?

127
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,957
Well, I'll tell you anyway,
even though I think it's nicer
when people guess.

128
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,159
Mrs. Henderson said to call her
at the telegraph office because
she says we have a telegram.

129
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,565
Ann, I don't think
you ought to put things
behind your ears.

130
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,697
Something might get
into your ear.
Emmy, Ann
says we have a telegram.

131
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:31,334
I think you ought to find out
about it. Somebody might be
sick or something.

132
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,674
Mrs. Henderson didn't read
the telegram...
Telegram for me?

133
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,805
Because I couldn't
find a pencil.

134
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,941
When I have a house,
it's going to be full
of well-sharpened pencils.

135
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,886
- Did Mrs. Henderson say
who the telegram was from?
- No. She didn't.

136
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,788
I think she might have said
who it was from.

137
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,452
Come on, Ann.
That's my chair.
I'll call up and find out.

138
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,985
If you will be quiet
just a second.

139
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,263
Hello. 181, please.
I wonder who it can be?

140
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,396
Oh, nothing, Operator.
Just 181.

141
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,100
If that's from my sister...
Hello?

142
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,167
Mrs. Henderson?
This is Emma Newton.

143
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,736
Ann says you have
a telegram for me.

144
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,748
Mama, you don't
have to shout.
Shh.

145
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,217
Really, Papa. You'd think
Mama had never seen a phone.

146
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,345
She makes no allowance
for science.

147
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,448
She thinks she has
to cover the distance
by sheer lung power.

148
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,655
Why, how wonderful.
Thursday, you say?

149
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,629
Looks like somebody's coming.

150
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,657
- Who's coming, Ma?
- Well, it's
the most wonderful surprise.

151
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:33,762
It's my brother, you know.
My younger brother. The baby.

152
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,639
Yes, of course, a little
spoiled. You know how families
always spoil the youngest.

153
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,871
Well, it's just
simply wonderful.

154
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,882
Thanks most awfully,
Mrs. Henderson.

155
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,885
Well.

156
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,646
What do you think?
Charles is coming.

157
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,659
Who?
Who?
Your Uncle Charlie.

158
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,664
- Did you say "Charles"?
- And our Charlie's gone
to send him a telegram.

159
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,997
Now, what made her think
to do that?
What do you mean our Charlie...

160
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,298
Hello, Charlie.
I just called your house.

161
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,999
Telegram for your mother.
Did you?

162
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,200
Gonna send that
by Bill Forest,
but you can take it.

163
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,143
Thanks.
From your uncle.
The spoiled one.

164
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,203
My uncle?
My Uncle Charlie?

165
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,408
Yeah.

166
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,746
Mrs. Henderson,
do you believe in telepathy?

167
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,757
Well, I ought to.
That's my business.

168
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,090
Oh, not telegraphy.
Mental telepathy.

169
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,131
Like... well,
suppose you have a thought,

170
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,996
and suppose the thought's about
someone you're in tune with.

171
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,505
Then across miles,
that person knows what you're
thinking and answers you.

172
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,008
And it's all mental.
I don't know what
you're talking about.

173
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,374
I only send telegrams
the normal way.

174
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,582
He heard me.
He heard me.

175
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,194
Mr. Otis? Mr. Otis?
Yes?

176
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,764
You're almost in Santa Rosa.
Want to be ready
when you get into Santa Rosa.

177
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,744
I'm ready now. Thanks.
Then I'll get all your bags
out for you, then.

178
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,373
How you feelin',
Mr. Otis?
Pretty well.

179
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,077
A little weak
but pretty well
on the whole.

180
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,085
Mm-hmm.

181
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,246
Harry, tell the porter
you're a doctor.

182
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,587
Ask if there's anything
you can do. Maybe you can
help that poor soul.

183
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,322
I'm on my vacation.
Porter, my husband's a doctor
and if there's anything...

184
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,854
No, Ma'am.
He's a very sick man.
Won't see anyone.

185
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,959
I haven't set eyes on him
myself since we first got
on the train.

186
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,800
Well, you don't look
very well either.

187
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,546
Ah, here we are.
Come on, children.

188
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,416
Close the door, there.
That's right.

189
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,979
Oh, are you...
Charlie.

190
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,952
Young Charlie.
At first, I didn't know you.
I thought you were sick.

191
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:13,082
Sick?
You aren't sick, are you?
Look, Pop! Here he is!

192
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,525
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you're not sick.
That was the funniest thing.

193
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:21,589
Sick? Me, sick?
Well, Joe, how are you?
All right, Charles.

194
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,830
Roger. Hello, Ann.
I bet you don't remember me.

195
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,361
I remember you sort of.
You look different.

196
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,238
Well, we better get started.
Emma's got the dinner
almost ready.

197
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,541
I couldn't persuade her
to come to the station.
Dinner came first.

198
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,582
Roger, get the bags.
Charles, I'll take that.
Thank you, Joe.

199
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,243
That's it.
Come on. Let's go.

200
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,540
Come on there, Roger,
and get these bags.

201
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,877
You, uh, sure
that isn't too heavy for you?

202
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,076
Oh, no. It's nothing.
I love to carry.

203
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,623
Emma. Don't move.

204
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,954
Standing there,
you don't look
like Emma Newton.

205
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,928
You look like Emma Spencer
Oakley of 46 Burnham Street,
St. Paul, Minnesota.

206
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,727
'The prettiest girl
on the block.
Charles!

207
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,326
Charlie.
Mama, nobody got off the train
but Uncle Charlie.

208
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,871
Let me look at you.
We were the only ones
who met somebody.

209
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:37,272
To think you could
take the time off.
There was only one bed made up.

210
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,005
Oh, Charles, it's so wonderful
to have you here.
Emmy, Emmy, don't cry.

211
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,547
And imagine your thinking
of 46 Burnham Street.

212
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,981
I haven't thought of that
funny old street in years.

213
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,750
- I keep remembering those things. All the old things.
- Emmy, how's he look?

214
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,813
Same old Charles, eh?

215
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,621
Roger, Ann,
get these other bags.

216
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,333
You have Charlie's room right here
at the head of the stairs.

217
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,862
Emmy wanted to move Ann,
but Charlie thought you'd be
more comfortable here.

218
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,033
Come on, Roger.

219
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,544
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Don't put the hat on the bed.
Superstitious, Joe?

220
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:16,513
No, but I don't believe
in inviting trouble.

221
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,796
It wasn't the biggest yacht
in the world, but it had
a fireplace in the library...

222
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,889
and the bar was panelled
in bleached mahogany.

223
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:12,596
You pushed a button and...
What am I talking about?
That's all over.

224
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,536
Let's talk about you.

225
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,167
Charlie, that's
the prettiest dress
I ever saw.

226
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,234
I think so too.

227
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,837
Why, Charles,
don't you remember?

228
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,848
Remember?
Remember what?

229
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,544
Why, Uncle Charlie,
you sent it to me.
I did?

230
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,747
Well, say, I've been
sitting here all this time
forgetting something.

231
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,791
Ann. Roger.

232
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,023
Look at that. Oh, dear now.
Joe. Don't know whether
you had one or not.

233
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,032
You didn't have to think
of me, Charles. Presents
for the children are all right.

234
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,001
Say... I've never had
a wristwatch.

235
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,868
Fellows at the bank'll think
I'm quite a sport.

236
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,434
I have two for you, Emmy.
One old and one new.

237
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,979
Oh, Charles.
What is it?

238
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,210
You shouldn't have.
Really. No.
Well, yeah.

239
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,115
Oh, Charles.

240
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,555
Oh, how... beautiful.

241
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,650
Oh, I've-I've
always wanted one.

242
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,821
Oh, Mother, it's exactly right.
It's what you should have.

243
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,831
Look, Emmy.

244
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,303
Charles.
You've had these
all along.

245
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,468
Mm-hmm.
All along, Emmy.
All these years.

246
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,206
Safe in a deposit box.
No matter where I was.

247
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,407
Oh. Grandpa and Grandma?

248
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,814
1888.

249
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,045
53 years ago.

250
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,714
Aren't they sweet?
My, she was pretty.

251
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,350
Everybody was sweet
and pretty then, Charlie.
The whole world.

252
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,089
A wonderful world.
Not like the world today.

253
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,496
Not like the world now.

254
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,501
It was great
to be young then.

255
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,732
We're all happy now,
Uncle Charlie. Look at us.

256
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,866
For once, we're all happy
at the same time.
Now, for your present, Charlie.

257
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,437
Oh, I don't want anything.
Right now, I have enough.

258
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,505
Before you came,
I didn't think
I had anything,

259
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,610
but now I don't want
another thing.

260
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,588
She's crazy.
She doesn't mean it.
Really.

261
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:15,183
If you ask me,
I think she's putting on.
Like girls in books.

262
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,320
The ones that say
they don't want anything
always get more in the end.

263
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,594
That's what she's hoping.
She's not crazy.

264
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,691
The smartest girl
in her class at school.

265
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,535
Won the debate
against the East Richmond
High School single-handed.

266
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,699
She's got brains.

267
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,577
I meant it.
Please don't
give me anything.

268
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,242
- Nothing?
- Oh, I can't explain it.

269
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:44,345
But you came here
and Mother's so happy and...

270
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,757
Oh, I'm glad that she named me
after you and that she thinks
we're both alike.

271
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,558
I think we are too.
I know it.

272
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:56,158
Oh, it would spoil things
if you should give me anything.

273
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:00,364
You're a strange girl, Charlie.
Why would it spoil things?

274
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:05,376
Because we're not just
an uncle and a niece.
It's something else.

275
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:10,006
I know you.
I know that you don't
tell people a lot of things.

276
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:15,951
I don't either.
I have a feeling that
inside you somewhere,

277
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,184
there's something
nobody knows about.

278
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,691
Something... nobody knows?

279
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,392
- Something secret and wonderful
and... I'll find it out.

280
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,434
It's not good to find out
too much, Charlie.

281
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:32,299
But we're sort of like twins.
Don't you see?

282
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,636
- We have to know.
- Give me your hand, Charlie.

283
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,078
Thank you.

284
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,024
You didn't even
look at it.
I don't have
to look at it.

285
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,186
No matter what you gave me,
it'd be the same.

286
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,196
Here. Let me show you.

287
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:05,197
It's a good emerald.
A really good one.

288
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:12,269
Good emeralds are
the most beautiful things
in the world.

289
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,518
You've had something engraved.
I haven't,
but I will if you like it.

290
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,147
Yes, you have,
Uncle Charlie.
It's very faint.

291
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:28,989
"T.S. From B.M."

292
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,325
But... Why, it must be
someone's initials.

293
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,226
Well, I've been rooked.
The jeweler rooked me.

294
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,668
Oh, it doesn't matter. Really.
Give it back.
I'll have it taken off.

295
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,138
No, No.
I like it this way.

296
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,335
Someone else
was probably happy
with this ring.

297
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,277
Oh, it's perfect
the way it is.

298
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,576
You bring the coffee.

299
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,333
Sing at the table,
you'll marry
a crazy husband.

300
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,430
Superstitions have been
proved 100% wrong.

301
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,999
Yes, I've been thinking
of transferring some money
out here from the East.

302
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,238
I could put it
in your bank, Joe,
until I found out what's what.

303
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:25,716
Uh, I suppose your bank
does take money, huh?

304
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,979
That's one thing we do.
Rake in the dough.

305
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,987
Can't promise
to give it back.

306
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,046
Well, I think I'll go
downtown in the morning
and open an account.

307
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:36,787
- Say, 30 or $40,000
just to start things off?
- That's a lot of money.

308
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,455
He won't have it long.
The government will get it.

309
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,762
The government gets...
You're not to talk
against the government, Roger.

310
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:47,237
My goodness. The way men do things.

311
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,967
I can't get that tune
out of my head.

312
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,737
Maybe if somebody tells me
what it is, I'll forget it.

313
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,746
It's a waltz.
I know it is, but what one?

314
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,782
You know, it's
the funniest thing.

315
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,181
Sometimes I get a tune
in my head like that...

316
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,220
and pretty soon, I hear
somebody else humming it too.

317
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,620
I think tunes jump
from head to head.

318
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,750
Do you know what it is,
Uncle Charlie?

319
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,625
Uh, no. No.
L-l-I don't know
what it is.

320
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:16,429
I remember. Uh...
It's on the tip of my tongue.

321
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,696
It's a waltz
and it's Victor Herbert.

322
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,366
- Victor Herbert wasn't a waltz.
He was...
- It's the Blue Danube waltz.

323
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,410
Oh, yes.
Of course it is.

324
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,072
No, it isn't, Uncle Charlie.
I know what it is.
It's the Merry...

325
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,551
I'm terribly
sorry, Emmy.
Nothing to make
a fuss over.

326
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,885
Charles, while we do
the dishes, why don't you come
in the living room...

327
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,425
and stretch out
on the sofa and read
the evening paper?

328
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,427
You never were much
on helping.

329
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,192
Joe, here's Herbert.
Help me clear the table.

330
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,462
Herbert's a friend of Joe's.
They're literary critics.

331
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,267
Hello, Herb.
Had your supper?

332
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,775
Had mine
an hour ago.
Hour ago, huh?

333
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,776
Oh. A watch.
Yeah. A present.

334
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,473
Here, Herb.
I'd like you to meet
my brother-in-law.

335
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:07,006
Charles, this is Herb Hawkins.
Nice to know you,
Mr. Hawkins.

336
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,417
Fine, thank you.
How's your mother, Herb?

337
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,184
Oh, uh, just middling.
Uh-huh.

338
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,192
Excuse me, Herb.

339
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,491
Oh.
Thank you. I'm sorry
your mother's not better.

340
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,691
Thank you, dear.
There, now.
Thank you.

341
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:25,327
Lead a life of luxury.

342
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,839
Well, I must go and see
what Charlie's doing.

343
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,910
Wife's brother from the East.
New York man.

344
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,280
Good for the children.
You know what I mean?

345
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:44,947
In business?
Well, he takes himself
very seriously.

346
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,287
Well, how's everything?

347
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,521
Say, ha-have you read
this one?
Huh?

348
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,529
That little Frenchman
beats them all.

349
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,430
You can talk all you like
about Sherlock Holmes.

350
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,434
That little Frenchman
beats 'em all.

351
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,903
I read it.
Air bubbles don't
necessarily kill a person.

352
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,907
Those writers
from the other side
get too fancy.

353
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,274
The best way
to commit a murder...
I know. I know.

354
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,540
Hit 'em on the head
with a blunt instrument.

355
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,139
Well, it's true,
isn't it? Listen.

356
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,276
If I wanted
to murder you tomorrow,

357
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:17,378
do you think
I'd waste my time
on fancy hypodermics?

358
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,423
Or on Inee?
What's that?

359
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,324
Inee-
Indian arrow poison.
Oh.

360
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:26,762
Listen. I'd find out
if you were alone, walk in,

361
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,062
hit you on the head
with a piece of lead pipe
or a loaded cane...

362
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,126
What'd be
the fun of that?

363
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,865
Where's your planning?
Where's your clues?

364
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,567
I don't want any clues.
I want to murder you.

365
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,940
What do I want
with clues?

366
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,071
Well, if you
haven't got any clues,
where's your book?

367
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:47,778
I'm not talkin'
'bout writing books.
I'm talking about killing you!

368
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,879
If I was going to kill you,
I wouldn't do a dumb thing
like hitting you on the head.

369
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,517
First of all,
I don't like
the fingerprint angle.

370
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,892
Of course, I could always
wear gloves, press your
hands against the pipe...

371
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:03,024
after you were dead
and make you look
like a suicide.
Ho ho!

372
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:08,061
Except it don't seem
hardly likely that you'd beat
yourself to death with a club.

373
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,232
I'd murder you
so it didn't look
like murder.

374
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:37,034
- Oh, Ann?
- What?

375
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,626
Come here.

376
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,935
Did you ever see a house
made out of newspapers?

377
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,339
Well, watch.

378
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,278
You-You take
one sheet here.

379
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,544
Okay?
And you tear it down here.

380
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,279
And you tear it there.

381
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:59,312
And you fold it
over here at the side.

382
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,358
Fold over
the other side here.

383
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,826
And turn it up there.

384
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,489
Now with... the door...

385
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:09,362
Right off... and there.

386
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:13,427
I'm not a baby
anymore. Besides,
that's Papa's paper.

387
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,531
Oh, Roger, look what we've got.
A nice, little red barn.

388
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,477
- You've got Papa's paper.
- Oh, that's all right.
Simply unfold it.

389
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:26,643
Nobody will ever know
the difference.
What are you two doing?

390
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,484
You know that's father's paper.
Oh, it's my fault, Charlie.
I was showing them a game.

391
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,116
Didn't think about it
being Joe's paper.
Oh, that's all right.

392
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:39,061
Here's page one,
five... eight.

393
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,860
What'd you do
with page three and four?
We never touched it.

394
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,993
Really. Uncle Charlie's
the only one that touched it.

395
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,661
Oh, well.
I guess it's all right.

396
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,434
If I fold it very neatly,
maybe he won't notice.

397
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,542
Come in.

398
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:04,816
I brought you water.
Oh, thank you, Charlie.
That's very thoughtful of you.

399
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,687
Pleasant dreams.

400
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:16,562
- Uncle Charlie, I know a secret
you don't think I know.
- What secret?

401
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:21,697
Remember I said you couldn't
hide anything from me
because I'd find it out?

402
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,867
Well, now I know there was
something in the evening paper
about you.

403
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,935
About me
in the evening paper?
About you.

404
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,503
And that's why
you played that game
with Ann and Roger.

405
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,675
You didn't want us to know
and you wanted
to tear the paper.

406
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,811
- Now I know.
You might as well tell me.

407
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,220
Well, you've got me
there, Charlie.

408
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,224
Only it wasn't about me.
It was about, uh...

409
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,852
someone I used to know.

410
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,427
There!

411
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,159
It's none of your business.

412
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,033
Oh! Uncle Charlie,
you're hurting me.

413
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,573
Oh, Charlie.
Your hands.

414
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,077
Charlie, I didn't mean
to hurt you.

415
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:03,272
I was just fooling.

416
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:07,182
It was nothing.
Just-Just some gossip.

417
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,449
Not very pretty
about someone
I once met up with.

418
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,026
Not for you to read.

419
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,087
Forget it.

420
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:26,364
Good night, young Charlie.
Good night, Uncle Charlie.
Pleasant dreams.

421
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,621
How long is Uncle Charlie
going to stay here?
Forever, I hope.

422
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,624
Hasn't he got
a house of his own?

423
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,092
Not that I mind you in here,
but I never can tell...

424
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,595
when I'll want
some privacy.

425
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,257
You better go
to sleep, baby.

426
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,358
You said your prayers?
I forgot.

427
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,528
You better say them.

428
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,440
I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep...

429
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,500
Don't bless too many people.
It's late.
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.

430
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:10,536
God bless Mama, Papa,
Captain Midnight, Veronica Lake
and the president...

431
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:15,746
You can't say them
all tonight, dear.
Oh, and Uncle Charlie. Amen.

432
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,816
All ready
for breakfast?
Oh, coffee. Emmy.

433
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,416
I don't know how you do it.
Now, I'm never comfortable
eating in bed.

434
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,757
I had to have my meals
in bed for awhile...

435
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,730
after the children came,
but I never liked it.

436
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:04,131
I can't face the world
in the morning. I must have
coffee before I can speak.

437
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,864
Well, I don't mind
pampering you
your first morning,

438
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,897
but I think you're
the only person in this town
to have breakfast at 10:30.

439
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:14,672
And while you were sleeping,
the newspaper called up
for an interview.

440
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:19,375
With me?
And the women's club I belong to
wants you to give a little talk.

441
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,419
Women's club.

442
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,890
Oh! Oh, you haven't
finished unpacking.
I'll do that for you.

443
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,927
Where's Charlie?
She's running around the house
as though she'd lost her mind.

444
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,928
She thinks everything
needs fixing.

445
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:36,899
But what I wanted to tell you
was that you are not
the only celebrity in this town.

446
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,301
The whole Newton family's
going to be in the limelight.
What are you cooking up?

447
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,738
Well, a young man called
this morning,
said his name was Graham...

448
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,936
and he wants to interview
everybody in this house.

449
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,172
Interview everybody?
That's what he said.

450
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:54,184
He's being sent
around the country by some kind
of institute or committee...

451
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,086
and he has to pick
representative American families
and ask them questions.

452
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,559
It's a kind of a poll.
It's called
the National Public Survey.

453
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,595
Wonder how he happened
to pick this family?

454
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,324
Well, he said he wanted
a typical American family.

455
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,060
I told him we weren't
a typical American family.

456
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,728
Well, if he's going to ask
a lot of questions,
he can leave me out of it.

457
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,569
Oh, but you could tell him
so much more
than any of us could.

458
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,099
- He's going to take
our pictures too.
- Pictures.

459
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,271
My. Isn't that lovely?

460
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:28,148
You see, there were really,
there were two young men.
One of them takes the pictures.

461
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:31,552
Oh, there were two.
Yes. Mr. Graham
was the nicest.

462
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,988
Oh, he doesn't want us
to dress up or anything.

463
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,653
Hejust wants us to act
the way we always do.
Emmy, women are fools.

464
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,128
They'd fall for anything.

465
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,302
Why do you let
two strangers come and turn
the place upside-down?

466
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,272
Why expose the family
to a couple of snoopers?

467
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,641
You ought to have better sense.
- Why, Charles, l...

468
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,510
Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
- Good morning, Charlie.

469
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:01,109
Your mother's been telling me
about the Newtons being picked
for all-American suckers.

470
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,278
What do you know about it?
Charlie wasn't here
when they came.

471
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,413
But really, Charles,
the way Mr. Graham
told it...

472
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,423
it wasn't
like snooping at all.

473
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:11,188
It was our duty as citizens.
It's something
the government wants.

474
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,163
Government?
Maybe not exactly,
but it's for the public good.

475
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,100
When I told them about you
and the places you've been,
he was really interested.

476
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,103
Now, listen, Emmy.
I'll have nothing
to do with this.

477
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,072
I'm just a visitor here
and my advice to you is
to slam the door in his face.

478
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,438
Oh. Well, l-I couldn't
do that.

479
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,602
But you don't
have to meet him
if you don't want to.

480
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,612
Well, I think I'd be
kind of exciting.

481
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,148
He'd take your photograph
and then we could have it
for nothing.

482
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,980
No thank you. I've never
been photographed in my life
and I don't want to be.

483
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,986
Oh, Charles,
how can you
talk that way?

484
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,955
I had a photograph of you.
I gave it to Charlie.

485
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,687
I tell you, there are none.
I guess you've
forgotten this one.

486
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,229
Get it, Charlie.

487
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,231
You sure
you don't remember?

488
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,598
Of course I don't ever remember
being photographed.

489
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,566
46 Burnham Street.

490
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,975
Mm-hmm. It was taken
the Christmas
you got your bicycle.

491
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,537
Just before your accident.
Uncle Charlie,
you were beautiful.

492
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,642
Wasn't he, though?
And such a quiet boy.
Always reading.

493
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,985
Papa never should have bought
you that bicycle. You didn't
know how to handle it.

494
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,721
He took it right out on
the icy road and skidded
into a streetcar.

495
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,923
We thought he was
going to die.
I'm glad he didn't.

496
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:25,435
Well, he almost did.
He fractured his skull,
and he was laid up so long.

497
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,700
And then,
when he was getting well,
there was no holding him.

498
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:32,072
And it was just as though
all the rest he had was,
well, too much for him...

499
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,112
and he had to get
into mischief
to blow off steam.

500
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,171
He didn't do
much reading after that,
let me tell you.

501
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,945
It was taken
the very day
he had his accident.

502
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:45,512
A few days later when
the pictures came home,
how Mama cried.

503
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:50,083
She wondered if he'd ever
look the same. She wondered
if he'd ever be the same.

504
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,562
What's the use of looking
backward? What's the use
of looking ahead?

505
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,965
Today's the thing.
That's my philosophy.
Today.

506
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,902
If today's the thing,
then you'd better
finish your breakfast...

507
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,030
and get down to the bank
because Joe'll be waiting.

508
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:07,635
And Charlie, don't be late back
because the questionnaire men
are coming at 4.00.

509
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,823
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Madge.

510
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,359
Good morning, Charlie.
Hello, Catherine.

511
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,395
Did you see the way
they looked at you?
I bet they wonder who you are.

512
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:39,637
Oh, Uncle Charlie,
I love to walk with you.
I want everybody to see you.

513
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,065
There's Papa in that
window over there.

514
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,639
Hello, Joe. Can you stop
embezzling a minute
and give me your attention?

515
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,200
Oh, uh...

516
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,441
Charles, we don't joke
about such things here.

517
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,040
Oh, what's a little shortage
in the books at the end
of the month?

518
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,847
Any good bank clerk can
cover up a little shortage.
Isn't that right, Charlie?

519
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,948
- Everyone can hear you.
- Good thing they can.
We all know what banks are.

520
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,791
Look all right,
but no one knows what goes on
when the doors are locked.

521
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,626
Can't fool me, though.
Well, Joe, let's see
your president.

522
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,996
Still want to open
that account, Charles?
That's why I'm here.

523
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,470
Well, uh, you wait right here.
I'll see if Mr. Greene's busy.

524
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,839
And, uh, Charles,
he doesn't care much
for jokes about banks.

525
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,674
Well, $40,000 is no joke.
Not to him, I bet.

526
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,375
It's a joke to me.
The whole world's
a joke to me.

527
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,850
I'll be right back.

528
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,719
You shouldn't tease
Papa like that.

529
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,891
I wasn't teasing him.
I just hate
this stuffy atmosphere.

530
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,567
They're waving
for us to come in.

531
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,232
Hello, Mr. Greene.
- Hello, Charlie.

532
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,575
Well, Mr. Greene, this is
my brother-in-law, Mr. Oakley.

533
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,580
How do you do?
How are you,
Mr. Oakley?

534
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,014
Well, Mr. Greene, I was thinking
of settling down here
for awhile.

535
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:31,316
Great country. Great country.
We think so.
What have you been doing?

536
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,186
I suppose you might call me
a promoter. I've done
a little bit of everything.

537
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,989
The only trouble I find is
that once I make the money,
I'm not interested in it.

538
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,030
Not interested in money?

539
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:43,555
You know there's plenty
of money lying around waiting
for somebody to pick it up.

540
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,797
I thought maybe I'd put
some of my loose cash away
for safekeeping.

541
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,466
- Naturally, I thought of the bank where Joe works.
- Loose cash?

542
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,409
Well, I got in a habit
of carrying a lot of cash
with me when I was traveling.

543
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:58,608
A dangerous habit, Mr. Oakley.
Hmm. Never lost a penny
in my life, Mr. Greene.

544
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,276
I guess heaven takes care
of fools and scoundrels.

545
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,083
Yes.
Thirty,
thirty-five, forty.

546
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,124
Forty thousand.
Shall we start
with forty?

547
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:12,424
- If you'll just write out
a deposit slip, Mr. Oakley.
- Ah, details.

548
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:16,023
I'm glad to see you're a man
who understands details,
Mr. Greene.

549
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,034
They're most important to me.

550
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:21,833
Most important.
All the little details.

551
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,534
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

552
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,409
We can come back.
Come in, now that
you're here. Come in.

553
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,779
Mrs. Greene,
I'd like you to meet
my uncle, Mr. Oakley.

554
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,614
Uncle Charlie,
this is Mrs. Greene
and Mrs. Potter.

555
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,052
Mrs. Greene,
Miss Potter.

556
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,215
Mrs. Potter.

557
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,920
Oh, and there was something
about you that made me think...
Yes?

558
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:48,397
- What did you want, Margaret?
- Well, we were going shopping
and I only had five dollars...

559
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,399
There's one good thing
in being a widow,
isn't there?

560
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:54,198
You don't have to ask
your husband for money.

561
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,739
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.

562
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,968
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.
Mrs. Potter.

563
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,908
Bye, Mrs. Greene.

564
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,406
There. There you are,
Mr. Greene.

565
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,110
Charlie, let's see the town
and have some lunch.
Good-bye, Mr. Oakley.

566
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,210
Bye, Mr. Greene.
Call on us
for advice anytime.

567
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,154
Thank you.
Joe, you may see
Mr. Oakley to the door.

568
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:18,217
Joe, keep your eyes open.
You'll have his job
in a couple of years.

569
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,540
Here he is.

570
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,584
Those must be
the questionnaire men.
They're a whole hour early.

571
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,286
I won't see them.
Don't worry.

572
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,125
You don't have to
if you don't want to.
I'll see that you don't.

573
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,165
The way they got
around your mother.

574
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,792
I thought she'd have
better sense.

575
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,407
How do you do?
How do you do?

576
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,308
You must be the men
who want to interview us.
My name is Graham, Miss Newton.

577
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,608
Oh, how do you do?
And this is Fred Saunders.

578
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,944
How do you do?
Won't you come in?

579
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,450
I'll call my mother.
Thank you.

580
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,578
Mother, the government men
are here.

581
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,589
Will you sit down?

582
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,989
But you said 4:00.
Nothing's ready now.

583
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,323
My husband
is still at the bank
and-and the house is...

584
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,886
That's all we want now,
Mrs. Newton.
Some pictures of the house.

585
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,933
Saunders can get busy
and I'd like to ask
a few questions.

586
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,699
All right, but I do wish
you'd waited until I had
the house looking its best.

587
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,900
I wanted flowers around
and fresh curtains
in the kitchen.

588
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,910
And there are a lot of things
I don't want you
to photograph.

589
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,376
I believe you told me
you owned the house?
Own it? It owns us.

590
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,146
It seems to me no sooner
do I get one thing fixed
then something else gets broken.

591
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,483
And then it needs
fresh paint and th...

592
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,489
Mr. Saunders,
I'm very sorry...

593
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,718
but you simply cannot
take a picture
with that chair in it.

594
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,524
- It needs a new slipcover.
- And there are, uh,
six in your family?

595
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,156
- Five.
- Five? But...

596
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,200
Well, my uncle's
just visiting.

597
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,236
I told you about him.
He's here from the East.

598
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,568
Put down five because my uncle
doesn't want to be bothered
with a lot of questions.

599
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,904
Well, you see,
on a survey, we usually...

600
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,909
He's not interested
in a survey...

601
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,377
and I promised him
he wouldn't be bothered.

602
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,381
Well, we'd like it
if we could get
all of you.

603
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,747
You know, your opinions,
what you do
or what you want to do.

604
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,117
My uncle's opinions
aren't average and I'm afraid
they wouldn't help you.

605
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,680
I think when someone
asks for privacy,
they should have it.

606
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,852
Well, we'll...
The whole idea of this
thing is that...

607
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,658
Mr. Graham,
perhaps you'd better
choose another family.

608
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:38,100
We'll do anything you say,
of course, but this family
seemed right and...

609
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,102
It is a nice family.

610
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,139
Charlie, why don't you let
the young men go ahead
so long as they're here?

611
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,607
Well, all right.

612
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,611
Okay. Saunders, go ahead
and get another shot.

613
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,809
Mrs. Newton, perhaps you could
tell me what organizations
you and your husband belong to.

614
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,817
How about a picture
in the kitchen?

615
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:58,013
Well, I'm afraid
the kitchen isn't quite
the way I'd like it.

616
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,454
Come along.

617
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,559
If you'll start
by breakin' an egg,
Mrs. Newton.

618
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,566
Oh, but you don't
start a cake
by breaking an egg.

619
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,569
You have to put
the butter and sugar
in first.

620
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,538
Survey or no survey,
I'm not going to start
by breaking an egg.

621
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,441
I thought I'd make
a maple cake. My brother
Charles loves maple cake.

622
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,810
What does your brother do?
Oh, I guess he just
does about everything.

623
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,817
What does he do?
Oh, he's just in business.
You know, the way men are.

624
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:32,584
My husband works in a bank,
but I think Charles
is just in business.

625
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:36,092
If you really want a picture
of me breaking an egg,

626
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,061
you'll have to wait
till I cream the butter
and sugar.

627
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,063
I'll wait.

628
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,258
I wonder if we
could take a look
at the upstairs?

629
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,359
You show us, and your mother
can call us when she's ready.
All right.

630
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,370
If you'd rather wait,
Mr. Saunders.

631
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,271
Folding in the eggs
has to be done
just right.

632
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,275
I can't beat them
and let them stand.

633
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,777
The minute I hear
you've broken the eggs,
I'll come right down.

634
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,973
Yes.

635
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,487
I really don't see
what you want
to look up here for.

636
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,993
Whose room is that?
It's mine. My uncle's
using it now, though.

637
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,860
I'd like to get an idea
what your room looks like.
Typical girl, typical room.

638
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,559
Typical of you to ask.
My uncle's resting.

639
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,863
I really don't want
to disturb him.

640
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:23,396
Is there a back stairs?
Mm-hmm.
Right down the hall.

641
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,169
I'll bet you 50 cents
that your uncle
isn't in there.

642
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,177
Oh, betting's silly.

643
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,146
All you want to do
is photograph my room.
Doesn't he?

644
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,207
That's it.
Besides, I know
my uncle's in there.

645
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,912
All right,
I'll still bet he isn't.
Let me knock and see.

646
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,649
Oh, I'll knock.

647
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:42,419
Uncle Charlie?

648
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,824
Uncle Charlie,
may we come in?

649
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,196
See?
You were right.

650
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,103
Nice room. Do you mind
if I take a picture or two
since he isn't here?

651
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,165
I certainly don't want
to disturb your uncle.
Oh, I suppose so.

652
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,940
But I really can't imagine
anyone being interested
in my room.

653
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:07,916
It's not the way I'd like it.
I'd like to have it all white.
Yellow and white.

654
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,919
Might as well let him
work in peace.

655
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,718
Besides, I'd like
to talk to you.

656
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,749
You know, your picking us
as an average family
gave me a funny feeling.

657
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,787
- What kind of a funny feeling?
- Oh, I don't know.

658
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:24,732
I guess I don't like
to be and average girl
in an average family.

659
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,860
Average families
are the best. Look at me.

660
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,371
I'm from an average family.
As average as ours?

661
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,737
Sure. Besides,
I don't think
you're average.

662
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:36,245
Oh, that's because
you see me now
instead of a few days ago.

663
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:41,717
I was in the dumps,
and then Uncle Charlie came
and everything changed.

664
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,754
But your mother said
he only got here last night.
Maybe you just think...

665
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:47,688
I don't think. I know.

666
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:53,094
Funny, but when I try to think
of how I feel, I always
come back to Uncle Charlie.

667
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:57,429
Are you trying to tell me
I shouldn't think
he's so wonderful?

668
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,030
Oh, no. L...
Mr. Saunders?

669
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,871
I'm ready with the eggs.
I hope Mr. Saunders
doesn't move anything in there.

670
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,743
My uncle's awfully neat
and fussy.
Saunders is neat and fussy too.

671
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:19,486
- Is this your uncle
you were telling us about?
- Yes, it is.

672
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,683
Now, for one of the hall.

673
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:29,130
Mr. Saunders has been taking pictures of my room.

674
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,499
My sister told me
to remind you
about eggs and a cake.

675
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,767
I don't like to be photographed.
I'll have to ask you
for the film.

676
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,105
Oh, Uncle Charlie.
Give it to me, please.

677
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,771
Give it to him, Fred.

678
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:47,078
That's too bad.
There's a picture
of Mrs. Newton on this film.

679
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,920
- Excuse me.
I'm ready to fold in the eggs.

680
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,759
I can't let them stand
another minute.

681
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:06,464
That was my last roll of film.
Oh.

682
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,970
Mr. Saunders took
Uncle Charlie's picture
by mistake...

683
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,803
and Uncle Charlie made him
give him back the roll.

684
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,639
He wasn't joking
about not wanting
to be photographed.

685
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,645
We didn't want
to start
a family feud.

686
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,647
I'll get you
making the cake
again tomorrow.

687
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,183
I won't be
making a cake
again tomorrow.

688
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,846
I want to help an important
work, but I cannot
go on making cakes.

689
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,890
You have helped,
Mrs. Newton.

690
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,892
And now I'd like
to ask another favor.

691
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,293
Could I borrow your daughter
for this evening? I'd like
to look around the town.

692
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,332
Ann?
Charlie.

693
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,496
Ann would be better.
Ann knows everything
about everybody.

694
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:44,438
Charlie.
Well, if, uh,
Charlie doesn't mind.

695
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,033
- I don't mind.
- Swell.

696
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,283
Good-bye, then,
Mrs. Newton.
Good-bye.

697
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,786
Half past 6:00?
Half past 6:00.

698
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,288
Okay. Good-bye.
Bye. Bye, Mr. Saunders.

699
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,291
Bye.
Good-bye.

700
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,424
He seems like
a nice young man.

701
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,556
But I thought you were
going to the movies
with Catherine.

702
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,864
Oh, I'll tell her
I don't feel well
or something.

703
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,518
Hello, Charlie.
Well... hello, Catherine.
Hello, Shirley.

704
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,991
Hello.
This is Jack Graham.
He's in town.

705
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,993
How do you do?
Hello.

706
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,623
How's your throat, Charlie?
Oh, much better.
Thank you.

707
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,860
Bill Forest was
asking about you.

708
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,495
Oh. Bill Forest?

709
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,801
Well, uh... good-bye.

710
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,000
Bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.

711
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,641
I know
what you are, really.

712
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,687
You're a detective.

713
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,484
There's something the matter
and you're a detective.
Charlie, listen.

714
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,651
I don't want to listen.
Why, you're not
on a survey at all.

715
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,661
You lied to us.
You lied to Mother.

716
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,926
You just wanted to get
in our house. Police.

717
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,967
That's what it is.

718
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,333
What do you want with us?
What are you doing around here
lying to us?

719
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,497
Look, Charlie,
you've got to listen to me.
You've got to trust me.

720
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,507
When you've done
nothing but lie?

721
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,339
And you probably didn't want
to take me out at all
the way I thought.

722
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,504
You just wanted to ask me
a lot of questions.

723
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,515
Have I asked you
a lot of questions?
Have I?

724
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,041
All right,
I'm a detective.
A pretty bad one.

725
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,054
Now, won't you even
listen to me?

726
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,522
Why should I
when you lied to me?
I had to.

727
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,526
When I came here
to find a man,
I hadn't counted on you.

728
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:48,360
I hadn't counted on your mother
or your family.
Find a man? What man?

729
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,298
There's a man loose
in this country.
We're after him.

730
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,531
We don't know much.
We don't even know
what he looks like.

731
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:58,700
Charlie, think.
How much do you know
about your uncle?

732
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:03,178
Why, he's my mother's
brother. What's he got
to do with it?

733
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,214
This man we want
may be your uncle.

734
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:09,048
Oh, I don't believe you.
Go away and leave me alone.

735
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,646
We're after one man.
Your uncle may be that man.

736
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:16,214
But in the East,
there's another man
who's being hunted, too,

737
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,818
through Massachusetts
and into Maine;
he may be the one.

738
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,227
My uncle hasn't
done anything.

739
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,131
He knows it would kill
my mother if he did.

740
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,035
He's her younger brother,
just like Roger is mine.

741
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,095
Why don't they arrest
that man in the East?

742
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,802
Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?

743
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,710
Charlie, when we were
eating tonight and talking
about our folks...

744
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,477
and what we'd done and how
we felt, we were like
two ordinary people.

745
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,484
We'd been brought up
about the same.

746
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,579
You liked me
and I liked you.
Oh, it doesn't matter now.

747
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,921
What do you mean,
"it doesn't matter"?
It's the only thing that does.

748
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,291
If it weren't for you,
you don't think I'd care...

749
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,421
how or where I caught up
with your uncle, do you?

750
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:58,991
Because if he's the guy,
I'm going to catch up with him.
Remember that.

751
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,401
And you're going to keep
your mouth shut.

752
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,099
You're going to keep
your mouth shut because
you're such a nice girl...

753
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,974
you'd help if you knew
your uncle was the man
we wanted.

754
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,945
I wouldn't help you.
And I know you would.

755
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,448
And I'm trying
to make it easier for you.

756
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,644
If your uncle's the man
we want, we'll get him
out of town quietly.

757
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,621
We won't arrest him here.
Arrest him here in town?
With Mother?

758
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,556
I'm trying to tell you
we won't.

759
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,627
- Please, Charlie.
- I won't say anything.

760
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,064
Oh, take me home!

761
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,115
Good night, Charlie.

762
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:50,277
It's going to be funny
when you find out
you're wrong.

763
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,514
Good night.

764
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:27,086
Hello, Charlie.
Home already?
Oh, yes, Dad.

765
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,354
It's so nice out, I thought
I'd get a breath of air
before I went to bed.

766
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,863
Well, you better run in.
Your Uncle Charlie's
been asking about you.

767
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,988
I think I'll just go up
the back way.

768
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,090
L-I'm tired and I don't
feel like talking.

769
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,567
All right.
Suit yourself.

770
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,570
Take care of yourself.
Mm-hmm.

771
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,300
Good night, Herb.
Good night, Charlie.

772
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,568
Good night, Charlie.

773
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,805
What were we saying, Herb?
Did I notice what?

774
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,812
Well, did you taste
anything funny...

775
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,871
about that coffee you had
at my house this evening?

776
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,110
No.
It tasted all right.

777
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,415
That's what I mean.
It wasn't all right.

778
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,183
Put something in it?
Put a little soda.

779
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,851
About the same amount
that I'd have used
if I'd wanted to use poison.

780
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,487
Well, you don't say.
I never tasted a thing.

781
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,726
Of course, I might not
notice the soda.

782
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:13,496
You'd notice the soda more
than you would the poison.

783
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,596
For all you knew, you might
just as well be dead now.

784
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,069
Aren't you
asleep yet, Ann?
Uh-uh.

785
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,045
Charlotte,
what are you doing?

786
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,179
Oh, I'm just looking
for a recipe
I thought I saw,

787
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,884
but it's just
so torn up...

788
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,189
They have papers
in the "libarry."
New ones and old ones.

789
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,253
Miss Corcoran
will get them out for you.

790
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,822
She won't even notice
if you cut out
a little, bitty recipe.

791
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,961
Oh, it's not
that important.

792
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,005
What time does
the library close?

793
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:27,532
If you read as much
as you should, you'd know
it closes at 9:00.

794
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,678
Oh, well.
If I think about it,
maybe I'll go tomorrow.

795
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:36,514
You really ought
to go to sleep, Ann.

796
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,232
Get back there!
Get back! Get back!

797
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,339
Just a moment, Charlie.
What do you think
I am out here for?

798
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,610
Oh, I'm sorry,
Mr. Norton.

799
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,618
All right. Go ahead.

800
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,885
Oh! Miss Corcoran,
please let me in!

801
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,897
Oh, please!

802
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,369
Oh, thank you.

803
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,530
Really, Charlie.
You know as well as I do
the library closes at 9:00.

804
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,699
If I make one exception,
I'll have to make
a thousand.

805
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:42,472
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corcoran,
but there is something
in the paper I've got to see.

806
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,013
I'm surprised
at you, Charlie.
No consideration.

807
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,016
Oh, I'll only be a minute.
You've got all day,
Charlie, to come here.

808
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,780
I don't know why you want
to rush in here tonight
like a madwoman.

809
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,048
I'll give you
just three minutes.

810
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,565
Can't be anything really awful.

811
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,969
I'll prove to him it isn't.

812
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,406
Page three...

813
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,343
Hello.

814
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:03,044
Where's Charlie?
She's still asleep.
I don't want to wake her.

815
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,486
Charlie still asleep?
No, she just woke up.

816
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,433
I shouldn't have let her sleep
so long, but she needed it.

817
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:23,131
She doesn't look quite herself.
She'll be down for dinner.

818
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,651
Mother, let me finish
mashing those.

819
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,698
I'll fix the rest of dinner
and get it on the table.

820
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,700
You go talk to
Uncle Charlie.

821
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,736
How do you feel?
Fine.

822
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,567
I must have been tired.
I slept like a log.

823
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,040
Uncle Charlie was
asking for you again.
He's fond of you.

824
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:05,672
And that nice young man
came twice to ask after you.
I told him you were asleep.

825
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:11,186
I'm rested now and ready for
anything. Is the gravy made?

826
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:16,317
Now you're humming that waltz.
Please don't hum
that tune anymore.

827
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,829
I've just got it out of my head
and don't want it started again.

828
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,559
And don't keep getting up
every few minutes.

829
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,363
You just sit there
and be a real lady.

830
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:31,168
All right, if you say so,
but at least I can
carry in the soup.

831
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:36,234
Roger, wash your hands!
Joe. Charles. Dinner.

832
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:42,875
Mama.
Ann, I told you
not to put things
behind your ears.

833
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:47,946
And don't whisper. Anyone
could hear you a block away.
May I sit by you at the table?

834
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:51,152
By me?
I should think you'd want
to sit by Uncle Charlie.

835
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:54,560
No, I want to sit by you.
Why do you want to change?

836
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,564
Mother, let her change
if she wants to.

837
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,827
Roger doesn't mind.

838
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:02,997
No, certainly not.
Uncle Charlie might think...
No, certainly not.

839
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:07,805
Mother, let her change.
All right, but Ann has
too many foolish ideas.

840
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:11,643
Go in the dining room,
both of you.

841
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,320
What's going on here?
Have I lost my little girl?

842
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,655
Roger wanted
to sit next to you,

843
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,254
and I thought it would be nice
if the children took turns.

844
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,265
I never...
Never what, Roger?

845
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:34,030
Nothing.
Come, Ann.
Come and help me.

846
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:39,302
Joe!
I brought it in by mistake.
Nothing special in it.

847
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,742
Want to look at
the headlines, Charles?
Thank you, Joe.

848
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,580
Roger, don't make
so much noise with your soup.

849
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,212
If he holds his lips close together,
he could draw it carefully, same as a horse.

850
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:55,223
Don't be disgusting. May I dip my bread in it?

851
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:58,283
Where's Charlie? She wanted to serve the dinner.

852
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:02,127
She'll be in in a minute.
You're right, Joe.

853
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:05,463
Nothing special tonight.
Oh, here she is!

854
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,503
Here's my girl.
I wonder how many
hours you slept.

855
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,472
If you could tell me
the exact minute
you went to sleep,

856
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,907
the exact minute you woke up,
if you woke up in between...

857
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,912
and how long
you stayed awake
each time you woke up,

858
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,914
then I could
tell you exactly...

859
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:24,544
You won't sleep tonight.
Nobody who sleeps all day
can sleep all night.

860
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,918
I slept all right,
and I kept dreaming...

861
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,480
perfect nightmares
about you, Uncle Charlie.

862
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,992
Nightmares about me?

863
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:37,158
You were on a train,
running away from something...

864
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:41,567
and when I saw you on the train,
I felt terribly happy.

865
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:45,334
How could you feel happy
seeing Uncle Charlie
on a train?

866
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:49,572
I don't want to see him
on a train. I hope
he stays here forever.

867
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:54,082
Well, he has to leave sometime.
We have to face the facts.

868
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,846
I like people
who face facts.

869
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,446
Well, we're not going
to face any such
facts as those.

870
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,950
Oh, Ann, would you like
to see the funnies?

871
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:09,430
I'm too old for funnies.
I read two books a week.
I took a sacred oath I would.

872
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:13,025
Besides, no one's allowed
to read at the table.
It isn't polite.

873
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,933
Don't correct
your elders!

874
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,165
She's right, Emmy. I'm
forgetting my manners.

875
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:20,231
Joe, I'm going to blame
this paper on you.

876
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:25,611
Roger, go to the icebox
and bring me a big red bottle
you'll find there.

877
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:28,912
You can throw the paper away.
Dad's read it, you've read it.

878
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,681
We don't need to play any
games with it tonight.

879
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,780
Ann, you can help Charlie
carry in the vegetables.

880
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:37,348
I saw that bottle
when I was getting dinner.

881
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:41,556
You know what St. Paul said:
"Take a little wine
for thy stomach's sake."

882
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,655
Wine for dinner...
Sounds so gay!

883
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:48,033
Remember the time they
had the champagne when the
oldest Jones girl got married?

884
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,038
This is sparkling burgundy.

885
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:54,736
One sip and I'll be calling it
"sparkling burgledy."

886
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,074
Maybe I'd better
not take any.

887
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,637
Oh... imported.

888
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:02,343
Imported Frankie
and his tweeds?

889
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,579
And his loaded cane.

890
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,883
His loaded everything!

891
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:16,691
Roger, go get four of
the small glasses with stems.

892
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:22,500
Charles, I promised Mrs. Greene,
the president of our club,
that you'd talk to the ladies.

893
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:27,270
What am I going to talk about?
Lecturers usually give travel
or current events.

894
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,607
Oh, not current events.
We get current events.

895
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,873
What sort of an
audience will it be?

896
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,348
Oh, women like myself.
Busy with our homes, most of us.

897
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,750
Women keep busy
in towns like this.

898
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:43,190
In the cities it's different:
Middle-aged widows,
husbands dead;

899
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:48,287
husbands who've spent
their lives making fortunes,
working and working,

900
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,733
and then they die and leave
their money to their wives...
their silly wives.

901
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:56,533
And what do the wives do,
these useless women?

902
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:01,269
You see them in the best hotels
every day by the thousands;

903
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,777
drinking the money,
eating the money,

904
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:07,009
losing the money at bridge,
playing all day and all night,

905
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,210
smelling of money.

906
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,982
Proud of their jewelry,
but of nothing else.

907
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:17,822
Horrible, faded, fat,
greedy women.

908
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:21,385
But they're alive!
They're human beings!

909
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,627
Are they?
Are they, Charlie?

910
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,034
Are they human or are they fat,
wheezing animals? Hmm?

911
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:33,542
And what happens to animals when
they get too fat and too old?

912
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:36,305
Well, I seem to be making
my speech right here.

913
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:42,283
Don't talk about women
like that in front of my club!
You'll be tarred and feathered.

914
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:47,482
And that nice Mrs. Potter's
going to be there too.
She was asking me about you.

915
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:52,755
The Greenes are bringing her
here to the party I'm having
for you after the lecture.

916
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,921
Joe, it's Herbert.

917
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,693
He always comes
when we're eating.

918
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,800
Good evening,
Mrs. Newton.

919
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:05,432
Good evening,
Mr. Oakley.
Good evening.

920
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,272
Well, Herb,
how's your mother?

921
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,278
Oh, she's just middling.

922
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:15,450
Had your dinner?
Oh, I had mine
an hour ago.

923
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:20,217
You folks are getting
pretty stylish. Having
dinner later every evening.

924
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,223
Ha ha!

925
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,955
Joe.
Huh?

926
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:34,731
Joe, l-I picked some
mushrooms before dinner.
You don't say.

927
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,636
Mushrooms mean anything
to you, Joe?

928
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:43,008
I eat 'em on my steak when
I'm out and the meat's not
good enough as 'tis.

929
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:45,342
If I brought you
some mushrooms,
would you eat 'em?

930
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:47,348
Suppose I would.
Why?

931
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:52,547
Then I've got it, you see?
The worst I'd be accused of
would be manslaughter.

932
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,455
Doubt if I'd get that.
Accidental death,
pure and simple.

933
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:01,224
A basket of good
mushrooms and...
two or three poisonous ones.

934
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:06,064
No, no. Innocent
party might get
the poisonous ones.

935
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,626
I thought of
something better
when I was shaving.

936
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:13,937
A bath tub.
Pull the legs out from
under you, hold you down.

937
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,340
It's been done,
but it's still good.

938
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,736
Oh, what's the matter
with you two?

939
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,408
Do you always have to
talk about killing people?

940
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,576
We're not talking about
killing people.

941
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,746
Herb's talking about
killing me, and I'm
talking about killing him.

942
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,881
It's your father's
way of relaxing.

943
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,188
Can't he find some
other way to relax?

944
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:36,027
Can't we have a little peace
and quiet here without dragging
in poisons all the time?

945
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:39,192
Charlie! She doesn't make
sense talking like that.

946
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,668
I'm worried about her.
Roger, bring her back.

947
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:45,969
I'll go. You stay
and finish dinner.
I'll catch up with her.

948
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,441
What's wrong with her?

949
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:04,721
Excuse me, Mr. Norton
You're always running
along the street at night.

950
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:08,661
Say, where were you going
in such a hurry last night?
Just doing an errand.

951
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:12,132
Is this gentleman your uncle
I've heard so much about?
Yes.

952
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,602
Uncle Charlie, Mr. Norton.
Glad to know you.
What's the name?

953
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,037
Oakley. Charles Oakley.
Nice to meet you.

954
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:22,601
Better keep your eye on your
niece. I'll have to give her
a ticket for speeding.

955
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:26,079
City ordinance about running
along these sidewalks.
Hear that, Charlie?

956
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:31,245
Don't want to break the law.
I'll take care of her.
Good night.

957
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,585
What's the matter, Charlie?
What's wrong?

958
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,895
I want to talk to you.
You're hurting
my arm again.

959
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,097
Come in here with me.
I can't. I've never been
in a place like this.

960
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,106
Go on in.

961
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,422
Why'd you bring me here?
What does it matter
where we are?

962
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,424
Hello, Charlie.
Hello.

963
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:14,656
Hello, Louise.
Uncle Charlie,
Louise Finch.
Hello.

964
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,360
This is my uncle.
I was in Charlie's
class in school.

965
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:23,667
I sure was surprised to
see you come in. I never
thought I'd see you here.

966
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,800
I been here two weeks.
Lost my job over at Kern's.

967
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:31,869
I've been in half the
restaurants in town.
What'll you have, Charlie?

968
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:37,317
Nothing, thank you.
Bring her some ginger ale.
I'll have a double brandy.

969
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:40,947
Well, Charlie.
Well?

970
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:45,153
Think you know something,
don't you? That young
fellow told you something.

971
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:48,094
Jack? Why should he
know anything about you?

972
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:55,633
Now look, Charlie.
Something's come between us.
I don't want that to happen.

973
01:12:55,704 --> 01:13:00,664
Why, we're old friends.
More than that...

974
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,678
We're like twins.

975
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:07,113
You said so yourself.
Don't touch me,
Uncle Charlie.

976
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,619
What did that
boy tell you?

977
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:17,592
He's got nothing to do with it.
I hope he never knows
anything about you.

978
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:23,427
Charlie, you're a pretty
understanding sort of girl.

979
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:29,132
If you've heard some
little things about me,

980
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:33,504
I guess you're
a woman of the world
enough to overlook them.

981
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,915
You're the head of
your family, Charlie.
Anyone can see that.

982
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:46,546
I'm not so old. I've been
chasing around the globe
since I was sixteen.

983
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,049
I guess I've done some
pretty foolish things,

984
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,788
made some pretty
foolish mistakes.

985
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,730
Nothing serious.
Just... foolish.

986
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:18,444
Oh, Charlie,
now, don't start
imagining things.

987
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:23,822
How could you do such things?
You're my uncle.

988
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,757
My mother's brother.

989
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:29,662
We thought you were
the most wonderful
man in the world.

990
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,462
- The most wonderful
and the best.
- Charlie, what do you know?

991
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:44,939
I'm sorry I was so long.
We're awful busy.

992
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,550
Whose is it?
Ain't it beautiful?

993
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:55,688
I'd just die for
a ring like that.

994
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:59,716
Yes sir, for a ring like
that, I'd just about die.

995
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:03,196
I love jewelry...
real jewelry.

996
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:07,964
Notice I didn't even have
to ask if it was real.
You can tell.

997
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,971
I can.
Bring me
another brandy.

998
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,006
Sit down.

999
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,011
Sit down!

1000
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:24,047
You think you know
something, don't you?

1001
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:27,247
You think you're the
clever little girl who
knows something.

1002
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:31,258
There's so much you
don't know. So much.

1003
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,556
What do you
know really?

1004
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:37,258
You're just an ordinary
little girl living in
an ordinary little town.

1005
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:41,666
You wake up every morning and
know perfectly there's nothing
in the world to trouble you.

1006
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,501
You go through your
ordinary little day...

1007
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:50,443
and at night, you sleep your
untroubled ordinary sleep filled
with peaceful, stupid dreams.

1008
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,380
And I brought you
nightmares.

1009
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:59,579
Or did I? Or was it a
silly inexpert little lie?

1010
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:03,091
You live in a dream.
You're a sleepwalker...
blind.

1011
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,752
How do you know what
the world is like?

1012
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,819
Do you know the world
is a foul sty?

1013
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:13,459
Do you know if you ripped
the fronts off houses,
you'd find swine?

1014
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:16,003
The world's a hell.
What does it matter
what happens in it?

1015
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:19,768
Wake up, Charlie.
Use your wits.
Learn something!

1016
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,775
You goin', Charlie?

1017
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,856
Charlie, will you
help me?
Help you?

1018
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:50,269
The same blood flows through
our veins, Charlie. A week ago,
I was at the end of my rope.

1019
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:56,210
Oh, I'm so tired.
There's an end to
the running a man can do.

1020
01:16:56,278 --> 01:17:00,180
You'll never know what
it's like to be so tired.
I was going to...

1021
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:08,353
Well... then I got the idea
of coming out here.
It's my last chance, Charlie.

1022
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:10,958
Give it to me.

1023
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,185
Graham and the other fellow,
they don't know.

1024
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:18,392
There's a man in the east.
They suspect him, too.
And if they get him, I'll...

1025
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,096
Charlie, give me
this last chance.

1026
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,695
Take your chance.
Go!

1027
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:27,674
I'll go, Charlie.
Just give me a few days.

1028
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,371
Think of your mother.
It'll kill your mother.

1029
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:33,846
Yes, it would
kill my mother.

1030
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:37,316
Take your few days.
See that you get
away from here.

1031
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,651
You realize
what it'll mean
if they get me?

1032
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,815
The electric chair.

1033
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:46,520
Charlie, you've
got to help me.
I count on you.

1034
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:51,897
You said yourself we're no
ordinary uncle and niece,
no matter what I've done.

1035
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:55,232
You go in.
I'll be in
in a minute.

1036
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,751
East, west, home's best. Where's Charlie?

1037
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,847
She's outside.
Don't worry about her.
What was the matter?

1038
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:20,418
She was a little edgy.
I persuaded her to go for
a walk. She's calmed down now.

1039
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:25,899
I'm so glad. I've saved
dessert for you, Charles.
We had an ice-cream soda.

1040
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:31,098
Oops-a-Daisy! Off to bed you go!

1041
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,960
Roger, come here!
No!

1042
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:05,403
There's my girl.
Psst! Ann!

1043
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,602
Hello! You must be trying
to hide or something.

1044
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:12,841
We're not hiding.
People who are hiding
always say "psst."

1045
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,644
We just don't want
to yell on Sunday.
Look, Ann.

1046
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:20,484
Ask your sister to run over here
for a minute. Just ask her
quietly. We'll wait here.

1047
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:24,218
Did my father and your
father have a feud?
My father?

1048
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,353
Because if they didn't,
there's no sense in my
asking Charlotte quietly.

1049
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:32,093
Mama won't care. She
thinks girls ought to
marry and settle down.

1050
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,863
In a book I'm reading...
Just ask her, Ann.
Don't be literary.

1051
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,803
All right.
Remember, I'm doing
all the talking.

1052
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:46,613
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, Catherine.

1053
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:48,979
Good morning, Mr. Graham.

1054
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,144
Catherine, this is
Mr. Saunders.

1055
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,688
How do you do?
How do you do?

1056
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:58,317
Ann says you want
to speak to me.
Saunders
wants to speak to you.

1057
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:04,093
Come on, Ann. Tell Catherine
the story of Dracula.
Come on, Catherine.

1058
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:10,133
What do you want?
Let them get a
little bit ahead.

1059
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:19,909
I, uh, want to tell you about
that photograph we took.
The one of your uncle?

1060
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,473
You gave it back to him.
He probably burned it.
Not that one he hasn't.

1061
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,884
We gave him
the wrong film.

1062
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:28,320
We got the picture
all right.
We wired it east.

1063
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:31,416
They've got witnesses
can identify the man we want
from that picture.

1064
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,018
What do you mean,
identify him?
Just what I said.

1065
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:37,394
The minute the witnesses see
that picture, we'll know
whether Oakley's the man.

1066
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,593
We're waiting for the wire now.
And then Uncle Charlie will be...

1067
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,036
That's right.
That's the way it is.

1068
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:51,271
Graham thought you could get
your uncle to leave town now.
It would be better for...

1069
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:55,248
I've got to, haven't I?
I've got to! What's the
most time you'll give me?

1070
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:57,012
Two hours.

1071
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,417
I'll make him leave!

1072
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,285
You seem pretty sure
he's the man we want.
Why?

1073
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:07,021
No reason why.
I'm just scared.
You're the ones who seem sure.

1074
01:21:07,095 --> 01:21:11,794
It's just that I can't stand
for anything to happen here.
You know what he's done?

1075
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,631
No, I don't want
to hear!
Well, I want you
to get this.

1076
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:19,936
We're really doing you a favor.
If you know anything more about
your uncle, let's have it!

1077
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:22,442
We also want to know
when and how he leaves town.

1078
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,104
If you hold out on us...
I won't.
I'll tell you.

1079
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,076
Step on a crack,
you'll break your mother's back.

1080
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,847
I wish I knew we
could trust you.

1081
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:36,322
I won't do anything
to help him, I promise.

1082
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:39,360
But you can't ask me
to spy on him.

1083
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:43,193
We've made a bargain.
I'll get him to leave.
That's all I'll do.

1084
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:46,063
Think, Charlie.
The man's dangerous.
If he gets away from us...

1085
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:51,299
I don't want to hear
what he'll do. We've made
a bargain. I'll keep it.

1086
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,001
I'll let you know
when he leaves.

1087
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:59,103
Funny if he turned out
to be the wrong man.
Could be.

1088
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:03,241
Ann.
I broke my mother's
back three times.

1089
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:07,550
Not bad. You didn't finish
telling me whether Miss Rose
married the rich guy...

1090
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:10,648
or the one she was in love with.
How long have you two
been so friendly?

1091
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:14,422
Oh, we play games.
I ask questions. She
knows all the answers.

1092
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,465
The only trouble is
I can't make out
what she's making up.

1093
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:22,663
I never make up anything.
I get everything from my
books. They're all true.

1094
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:26,798
Come on, Ann. We'd better
get home and help
with dinner. Good-bye.

1095
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:30,470
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Graham.
Mr. Saunders.

1096
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,706
Good-bye, Catherine.
Come on, Catherine.

1097
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:37,309
Why don't you pick some
flowers for the dinner table?
Simple flowers are the best.

1098
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,912
I didn't ask for orchids.
I wish I'd been born in the South.

1099
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:44,425
Southern women have a lot
of charm. They pick
flowers with gloves on.

1100
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:47,120
Good-bye, Catherine.
Good-bye, Charlie.
See you after dinner.

1101
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:48,526
Bye.

1102
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,198
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello.

1103
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:57,204
How was church, Charlie?
Did you count the house?
Turn anybody away?

1104
01:22:57,272 --> 01:22:59,706
No, room enough
for everyone.

1105
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,901
I'm glad to hear that.

1106
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:06,346
Show's been running such
a long time, I thought maybe
attendance might be falling off.

1107
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:09,110
Anything special on
the noon broadcast?

1108
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:13,553
A fellow said they caught
that other fellow...
the Merry Widow Murderer.

1109
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:16,920
They did, did they?
Where?
State of Maine. Portland.

1110
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,484
Didn't catch him exactly.
He was running away
from the police,

1111
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:25,124
and they were just about to nab
him, at the airport, and he ran
into the propeller of a plane.

1112
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:29,637
Ooh, boy!
Cut him all to pieces. Had
to identify him by his clothes.

1113
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:33,731
His shirts were all initialed,
"C," "O," apostrophe "H."

1114
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:36,402
Well, makes a good ending.
Couldn't have done
better myself.

1115
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:38,844
I guess that closes
that case pretty final.

1116
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:42,280
Sure does. Never cared
much for that case.

1117
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:47,947
Well, I think I'll go get
ready for dinner. I'm hungry.
I can eat a good dinner today.

1118
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:50,445
Charlie, I have
great news for you.
Where can we talk alone?

1119
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:07,025
We got a wire from Maine,
so we can call off the job.
I'll bet you're relieved. I am.

1120
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,036
Oh, I am relieved.

1121
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,767
Here you were trying to get
your uncle out of town. He must
have thought you were crazy.

1122
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,038
Now that it's over, I don't
want to talk about it anymore.

1123
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,841
I'd like to pretend the whole
dreadful thing never happened.

1124
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:23,247
There's nothing
to pretend about.
There's mother's gloves.

1125
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:26,344
Mother and her gloves.
She's always losing things.

1126
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,822
All mothers lose things.
Someday, she'll be losing you.

1127
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:33,691
Mothers don't
lose daughters,
they gain sons.

1128
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:37,219
That's right. But gain
isn't always the word.
Now take me.

1129
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,698
Who'd want a detective
for a son-in-law?

1130
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:42,031
My father would.
He would?

1131
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:47,507
If you said to him, "Father,
I'm going to marry a detective,"
he wouldn't disown you?

1132
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,600
It wouldn't
have to be me.
There's Ann.

1133
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:53,977
No, Ann wants to marry
a librarian. She told me.

1134
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,814
So she'll always have plenty
of books around to read.

1135
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,745
What's the matter?

1136
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:05,554
I was laughing.
It's been so long
since I laughed.

1137
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,424
I like it
when you laugh.

1138
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:12,899
I like it when you don't.
I guess I like you
whatever you do.

1139
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:17,529
I guess I like you.
I'm glad.
I like you too.

1140
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:22,907
Funny how you happen to meet
someone and like them and...
like them.

1141
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,911
Mm-hmm.

1142
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,913
Charlie?
Yes?

1143
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:31,782
I suppose it couldn't ever
really happen some day that
you'd tell your father...

1144
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:35,721
You know, about
marrying someone...
a detective, I mean.

1145
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,953
I don't know.
I didn't mean
to tell you.

1146
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,485
I wanted to wait until you'd
forgotten all the mess we've
been through together,

1147
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:45,590
'til you could stop
thinking of me as something
unpleasant and frightening.

1148
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:50,263
I wanted to wait and come back
and then tell you.

1149
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:52,738
But I can't help it.
I want to tell you now.

1150
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:56,470
I love you, Charlie.
I love you terribly.

1151
01:26:56,544 --> 01:27:00,810
I know it's no time
to tell you now and
I'm sorry. Do you mind?

1152
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:03,874
I don't mind.
Do you think you
could think about it?

1153
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:09,515
About your
loving me?
And perhaps your
loving me.

1154
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:15,154
L-I'd like us to be
friends. I know that.
We are friends.

1155
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,927
I'd like to have
that to think about.
Nothing more?

1156
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,300
I don't know, Jack.
I... just don't know yet.

1157
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:26,602
All right.
But I may
come back?

1158
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:31,236
Oh, please come back.
Please come back.

1159
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,181
Listen, Charlie.

1160
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,979
When I go,
go back to that square
in the middle of town.

1161
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:40,817
Take a good look at it.
That's where I first knew
I loved you.

1162
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:44,915
That's where we had the fight.
I didn't know what to do.

1163
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:48,019
I like my job, but I
didn't like it that night.

1164
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,189
I hated it
that night.

1165
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,393
You hate it now?
No, not now.

1166
01:27:55,169 --> 01:28:00,004
You know, this is a swell
place. I'm going to put
a bronze plaque up there.

1167
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:05,341
That door's always
banging shut!

1168
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,143
Ohh! Dig!

1169
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,051
Uh!

1170
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:24,164
What are you two
locking yourselves
in the garage for?

1171
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,530
When I was young,
we sat in the parlor.
Hello, Mr. Oakley.

1172
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:29,069
I was saying
good-bye to Charlie.
In the garage?

1173
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,071
The door got stuck.

1174
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,073
Now I'll have to say
good-bye to you.

1175
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:36,907
Let's say good-bye out here
on the lawn. No use taking
a chance on the garage.

1176
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,913
- Finished here?
- All finished,
but I'll be back.

1177
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,916
You'll be
seeing me around.
Oh?

1178
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,282
Not on business,
though.

1179
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:49,483
I can understand
you coming back.
Charlie's a fine girl.

1180
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:52,117
She's the thing
I love most in the world.

1181
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:55,424
I mean it.
Have a nice trip,
Mr. Graham.

1182
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:58,465
And don't take
any more photographs
without permission.

1183
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:01,229
Rights of man.
You know, freedom?

1184
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:05,033
We'll have a talk
about freedom some day,
Mr. Oakley.

1185
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,279
Bye.
Good-bye.

1186
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:19,409
Don't forget to write.
Remember, you have the addresses.
Mm-hmm.

1187
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:28,461
Jack!

1188
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:07,298
Anything else? I've got
butter, fruit, green thread
and go to the library.

1189
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:11,771
And whatever vegetable looks
freshest. If I've forgotten
anything, I'll send Ann later.

1190
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,773
All right.

1191
01:30:18,813 --> 01:30:20,747
Mother!

1192
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:24,080
Charlie! Darling!
Are you hurt?

1193
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:26,086
I tripped.

1194
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,816
Oh, what is it?
Is it your ankle?

1195
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,950
I don't think I'm hurt.
I grabbed the bannister.

1196
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,688
Oh, darling. You
might have been killed!

1197
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:39,096
I worry myself sick every time
one of the children
come down these stairs.

1198
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:42,102
They're too steep and rickety.
They ought to be fixed.

1199
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:44,536
Are you sure
you're all right?

1200
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:27,380
When are you leaving,
Uncle Charlie?

1201
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:31,714
Oh, come now, Charlie.
That other business, it's all
over. I'd like to forget it.

1202
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,584
We're all happy here.
When are you leaving?

1203
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,623
I'm not going,
you see.

1204
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:40,157
Not yet.
I'm not going.

1205
01:31:40,228 --> 01:31:44,255
I want to settle down. Live in
a place where people know me.
Have some money in the bank.

1206
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,824
Some sort of business.
Be a part of this family.

1207
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:53,568
I see.
The most sensible
thing for you to do
is to be friends with me.

1208
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:56,508
I can do a lot
for you, Charlie.
For all of you.

1209
01:31:56,577 --> 01:32:00,673
No, not you.
We don't want
anything from you.

1210
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:05,412
I wish I'd told
my mother about you.
I know
what you've been thinking.

1211
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:09,320
How do you think your
mother would have felt?
What would it do to her now?

1212
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,689
How about your father?
His job at the bank?

1213
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,524
What would become
of all of you
if everything came out?

1214
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:19,054
You needn't be afraid.
I can't tell them.

1215
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:23,900
But I'm not afraid.
What would you tell?
Who'd believe you?

1216
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,235
A waltz runs
through your head.

1217
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:30,641
You don't like the initials
on a ring and connect it all
up with a newspaper clipping.

1218
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:34,738
You haven't even got the ring.
I don't know what became of it.
You have it.

1219
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:38,546
I?
I gave it to you.

1220
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:45,282
I don't want you here,
Uncle Charlie. I don't want
you to touch my mother.

1221
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:50,854
So go away...
I'm warning you. Go away,
or I'll kill you myself.

1222
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,628
See? That's the way
I feel about you.

1223
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:22,321
Here you are, Joe.
Oh, perfume.

1224
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:26,628
Just the nice, fresh,
clean smell of lavender.
Yeah, I know.

1225
01:33:26,701 --> 01:33:31,729
You look very handsome,
both of you. I'm pretty proud
of the two men in my family.

1226
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:35,742
Emmy, you're a dream.
It's a shame the children
have to sit on our laps.

1227
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:39,177
It's going to be a
tight squeeze. It won't
do my pants any good.

1228
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:42,875
Joe, I wish you could drive.
We do it this way:

1229
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:46,647
Charles, you'll sit...
Uncle Charlie can
sit in back with Dad...

1230
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,383
and the children can
fit in beside them.

1231
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,049
I'm getting a cab.
You all go in the taxi...

1232
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:55,061
Charlie and I'll go in the car.
No, Uncle Charlie,
you go in the taxi.

1233
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,494
I want to ride in the taxi!

1234
01:33:56,564 --> 01:33:58,964
Course you do.
So it's all arranged.

1235
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:03,094
Charlie, run out to
the garage and get the car.
I'd rather drive the family.

1236
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:08,472
I want you to hear
my speech on the way.
You're my severest critic.

1237
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:13,206
Anyway, we need a taxi.
Ann, go call Mr. Abercrombie.

1238
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,214
Mother!

1239
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:21,277
Mother, please ride with me.
Father can take the children.
Please!

1240
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:14,440
Bet I'll be the only man outside of Charles
fool enough to dress up like this.

1241
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:19,343
Then You'll be the only other one to be correct.
You look very distinguished.

1242
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,347
Charles, are you all ready?
Joe, are you?

1243
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:24,213
Wait a minute!
I've got to
get my overcoat.

1244
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:26,219
Please, dear.
Hurry!

1245
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:29,484
Take your time, Emmy.
They can't start
'til I get there.

1246
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,787
It's getting
chilly in here.

1247
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:34,293
KSRO, Santa Rosa,

1248
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:37,762
with studios in Vallejo
and Santa Rosa, California.

1249
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,630
May as well have
a little music
while we wait.

1250
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:44,159
Oregon State Police pressed
their search today for five...

1251
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:47,298
Oh! Does it have
to be so loud?

1252
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:49,342
Gets the lower
tones better.

1253
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,870
I like it loud!
If music's too soft, I can't
tell what they're playing!

1254
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,314
If I have a band,
I'm a-least have 87 men.

1255
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:59,375
Help, everybody!
Somebody's caught in the garage.

1256
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:02,547
They're suffocating!
There's something
the matter with the door.

1257
01:36:02,623 --> 01:36:04,557
Joe!

1258
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,915
I'll take her.
I've got her.

1259
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:37,688
Joe, there's a bottle
of whiskey on my bureau.
Get it quick.

1260
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:40,488
Charlie. Charlie.
Dear Charlie.
Charlie?

1261
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:43,621
Emmy, rub her feet.
Roger, run get something
to fan her with.

1262
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:46,188
Charlie!

1263
01:36:46,267 --> 01:36:48,895
Ann, don't, dear.

1264
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:52,370
Charlie? What are you
trying to say, Charlie?

1265
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:59,239
Go away.

1266
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:01,247
Go away.

1267
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,542
Emmy, she wants you.

1268
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:09,385
I'm here, darling.
Here's mother.
That's right, my baby.

1269
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:13,358
That's right,
my brave little girl.
Here...

1270
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:15,918
Take a little
sip of this.
No...
I'm alright.

1271
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:20,831
Joe, call Dr. Phillips.
No, I'm all right.
I just want to get up.

1272
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:24,928
You had a wonderful escape,
Charlie. Someone must have
left the motor running.

1273
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:28,634
I couldn't find the key to turn
it off.
The key was there
when I went in.

1274
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:31,007
Lucky thing I passed by.

1275
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:34,707
She might have died.
You saved her.
You knew just what to do.

1276
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:39,082
- Don't know how I happened
to come across that way.
- We'll put the lecture off.

1277
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:43,817
Oh, yes, there is.
I want you all to go.
There's the cab now.

1278
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:46,655
Oh, I couldn't.
I just couldn't go.

1279
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:50,163
Wh-Who found me
in the garage?

1280
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,597
Herb heard you
beating on the door.

1281
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,762
I was coming across the backyard
and I heard this gaspin'
and beatin'on the door.

1282
01:37:56,837 --> 01:37:59,897
I figured there must be
a human bein' in there.

1283
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,272
Quick thinking,
Herb.
Lucky thing.

1284
01:38:02,343 --> 01:38:04,834
I'm glad you happened
to be going by, Herb.

1285
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:07,346
Come on, Mother.

1286
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,348
L-I want to
stay with you.

1287
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:14,115
I don't feel like making a
speech now. When I think what
might have happened to Charlie.

1288
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:18,249
I'm all right. I just
want to sit on the porch
a while and get the air.

1289
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:20,259
No, darling,
I won't hear of it.

1290
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:25,458
I'm all right, really.
I'd rather stay home and get
things ready for the party.

1291
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:28,126
Darling, I want
to stay with you.

1292
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:37,042
Herb, will you take Roger?
Ann, you come with us.

1293
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:44,879
I just don't understand it.
First the stairs and...

1294
01:39:03,804 --> 01:39:06,204
Mr. Graham isn't there?

1295
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:11,574
This is the Hotel Stewart
in Fresno, isn't it?

1296
01:39:11,645 --> 01:39:14,170
And you don't expect him?

1297
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:17,308
I see. Thank you.

1298
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:22,447
He isn't there?
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

1299
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:25,321
Can you tell me
where I can reach him?

1300
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:29,590
I've already tried
to get him at the address
he gave me in Fresno.

1301
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:32,999
Thank you.

1302
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:13,739
Mom, may we have
some sandwiches?

1303
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:17,800
Don't take anything
from the dining room.
Go in the kitchen.

1304
01:40:17,878 --> 01:40:21,109
Please go away.
And just leave
your coats...

1305
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:24,850
Joe, dear, will you
take care of everyone?

1306
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:26,545
Charlie!

1307
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,554
I'll be right down.

1308
01:40:28,622 --> 01:40:31,716
Well... now... hmm.

1309
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:39,325
Now, now, Mr. Oakley.
I thought champagne was
only for battleships.

1310
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:45,134
None for me and none, I'm sure,
for my wife. But we hope
you'll all forget we're here.

1311
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:48,538
I'd like to propose a
toast to... Isn't
Charlie coming down?

1312
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:51,601
She'll be down
in a moment.
Mrs. Potter.

1313
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:56,581
Don't take that one. I don't
know why I make tomato. They
always soak through the bread.

1314
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:01,519
Try one of these. It's just
whole wheat bread and cream
cheese. Paprika makes it pink.

1315
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:03,920
Mrs. Greene, what
would you like?

1316
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,925
Thank you.

1317
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:08,985
I think I'd like to
propose a toast, too.
Emmy.

1318
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:14,399
To our distinguished visitor,
The man who's made the best
speech heard in town for years.

1319
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:17,665
To that
very good fellow,
Mr. Oakley.

1320
01:41:17,738 --> 01:41:20,434
Herbie.
Thank you.

1321
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:22,600
We don't get many
American speakers.

1322
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:25,668
Seems like foreigners
make the best talkers.

1323
01:41:27,614 --> 01:41:31,243
Ah, here she is.
Now for my toast.

1324
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,394
Charlie...

1325
01:41:43,263 --> 01:41:45,697
you're just in time
for a farewell toast.

1326
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:50,897
I hate to break the news
to you like this, but tomorrow
I must leave Santa Rosa.

1327
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:54,236
Not forever.
If that isn't
thre strangest coincidence.

1328
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:57,004
I was planning to go to San Francisco tomorrow.
Charles.

1329
01:41:58,579 --> 01:42:01,571
Oh, Emmy darling,
I didn't mean to
spoil your fun tonight.

1330
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:05,448
I got a letter today.
I have to catch
the early morning train.

1331
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,320
I'll miss you, Emmy.

1332
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:16,528
But I want you all to know
that I'll always think
of this lovely town...

1333
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:20,724
as a place of hospitality
and kindness...

1334
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:24,862
and homes... homes.

1335
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:29,773
- But I can't bear it
if you go, Charles.
- Oh, Emmy, I'll be back.

1336
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:35,543
I've arranged with
Dr. Phillips for our little
memorial for the children.

1337
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:39,050
It isn't any
of the things you've done.

1338
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:46,386
It's just the idea that
we were together again.
I'm sorry!

1339
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:50,556
But you see, we were
so close growing up.

1340
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:54,260
And then Charles went away,
and I got married, and...

1341
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:57,562
Then you know how it is.

1342
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:03,573
You sort of forget you're you.
You're your husband's wife...

1343
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:08,442
We'll be looking for you.
We feel you're one of us,
don't we, Margaret?

1344
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:12,246
Indeed. I want to thank
you on behalf of our club.

1345
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:14,446
And bless you for your
gift to our hospital.

1346
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:18,252
The children will bless you,
too, in the years to come.
Thank you, sir.

1347
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:22,022
Excuse me, sir, but l-I can
hear the train coming now.

1348
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:23,585
Excuse me.

1349
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:37,673
Better get aboard,
Charles.

1350
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:42,545
All right. Good-bye,
everybody. Roger, Ann,
come see the train.

1351
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:45,551
Come on, Charlie.
You can see
they get off.

1352
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,553
All right.

1353
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:50,021
I want to see the rooms,
the private ones.

1354
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:54,186
I've seen berths.
I've slept in two uppers
and one lower with Papa.

1355
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:57,128
Good-bye, Joe.
Good-bye, Charles.

1356
01:43:57,197 --> 01:44:00,598
Good-bye, Emmy.
Good-bye. And don't
forget to write!

1357
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:04,728
I will. You write too.
I'll send you my address.

1358
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,844
Good-bye.

1359
01:44:15,249 --> 01:44:17,649
Don't jump on
the seats, Roger.

1360
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:21,817
Roger, what
did I tell you?

1361
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:29,355
Porter, there's one more bag.
It got taken into the other car.
Will you get it please?

1362
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:33,160
Charlie, the train's
going to start. I don't
want to get carried away.

1363
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:36,134
Maybe it's too late!
Maybe I'll have to go along!

1364
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:38,467
There's plenty of time.
You run along, we'll follow.

1365
01:44:38,538 --> 01:44:40,699
Charlie.

1366
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:43,675
Just a minute.

1367
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:47,510
I want you to know
I think you were right
to make me leave.

1368
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:52,112
It's best for your mother.
Best for all of us.

1369
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:56,950
You saw what happened
to her last night.

1370
01:44:57,024 --> 01:45:01,859
She's not very strong,
you know. I don't think
she could stand the shock.

1371
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:05,227
I remember once when
she was a little girl...
The train's moving!

1372
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:11,204
Listen, Charlie. I want you to
forget all about me. Forget
that I ever came to Santa Rosa.

1373
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:14,773
Your hands!

1374
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:19,837
Let me go,
Uncle Charlie!
Let me go!

1375
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,683
I've got to do this,
Charlie...

1376
01:45:25,752 --> 01:45:28,118
so long as you know
what you do about me.

1377
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:43,598
Not yet, Charlie.
Let it get a little faster.

1378
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:46,266
Just a little faster.

1379
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,773
Faster.

1380
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,275
Now!

1381
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:17,537
Santa Rosa has gained and lost a son,

1382
01:46:17,604 --> 01:46:20,198
a son that she
can be proud of.

1383
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:25,176
Brave, generous, kindly.
With all of
the splendid dignity...

1384
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:31,150
I'm glad you were able to come,
Jack. I couldn't have faced it
without someone I knew.

1385
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:37,916
I did know more.
I couldn't tell you.
I know.

1386
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:43,488
He thought the world
was a horrible place.

1387
01:46:43,563 --> 01:46:47,397
He couldn't have been
very happy ever.
No.

1388
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:53,402
He didn't trust people.
He seemed to hate them.

1389
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:55,771
He hated
the whole world.

1390
01:46:57,310 --> 01:47:00,802
You know, he said
that people like us...

1391
01:47:00,881 --> 01:47:05,079
had no idea what the world
was really like.

1392
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:08,212
Well, it's not quite
as bad as that,

1393
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:11,223
but sometimes it needs
a lot of watching.

1394
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:14,317
It seems to go crazy
every now and then.

1395
01:47:14,394 --> 01:47:16,589
Like your Uncle Charlie.

1396
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:19,928
Of their souls, the sweetness
...the beauty of their characters...

1397
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,490
live on with us forever.
