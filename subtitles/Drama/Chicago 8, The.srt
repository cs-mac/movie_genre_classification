00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,941
Why would we want to
take that away from you?

168
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,043
[chuckles] Kids, you
should know they make

169
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,446
the rescue helmets extra big to
fit their heads inside them.

170
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:13,814
There are two types of firefighters.

171
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:15,148
Those who are on squad,

172
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,317
and those who wish they were on squad.

173
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:20,954
- Ooh.
- Come on, kids.

174
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,189
Bet I get an application from him

175
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,356
by the end of the month.

176
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,927
He wants you, you can have him.

177

[alarm wailing] [buzzing]

178

[over PA] Pin-In accident.
Columbus Drive Bridge.

179
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:36,821
Ambulance 61, engine 51, truck 81.

180
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:39,961
Squad three, battalion 25.

181
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:43,599
Let's go! Let's go!

182
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,804
Let's go!

183
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:52,875
[siren wailing]

[honking]

185
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,828
Mills, shadow Mouch.

186
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:16,297
Walk with a purpose, but don't run.

187
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:18,633
Take it all in, know the
details of the situation

188
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,735
before you act.

189
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:23,137
Oh, and Mills, don't be a crow.

190
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:26,275

[handle rattling]

192
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:43,291
- Ma'am? Can you hear me?
- My daughter--

193
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,660
- [groans]
- Madeline?

194
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,030
- Hey, Cruz, grab the saw!
- Madeline! My little girl.

195
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,331
I see her. She's okay.

196
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,199
Get the jaws!

197
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,569
This is chief Boden, I'm
gonna need two more ambulances

198
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,304
and a helicopter.

199
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,772
Will you find her?

200
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,674
Mother, daughter trapped.
Both responsive.

201
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:00,808
- Can you hear me?
- Madeline.

202
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,043
Madeline?

203
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,045
Are you hurt, honey?

204
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,680
Okay, can you tell me where you're hurt?

205
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:06,747
My body.

206
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:09,351
We're leaking fuel!

207
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:13,054
Okay, you mean your tummy or your chest?

208
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,055
My chest.

209
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,890
Madeline, mommy loves you.

210
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:18,225
Everything's gonna be okay.

211
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,760
Madeline, look at mommy.

212
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,228
Oh shh--He's in the water.

213
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,930
- He's in the water!
- Who?

214
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,267
The driver. He was ejected.

215
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,870
We think we got one in the river. Go.

216
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:30,972
We're on it!

217
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,840
Listen, Madeline, I want you to see

218
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,775
if you can turn your head toward me.

219
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,979
Can you do that?

220
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,914
Madeline. Madeline.

221
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:43,619
- [sobbing]
- Give me your legs.

222
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,256
It's okay.

223
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,725
All right, husting and me are going.

224
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:52,293
Capp and Hadley on rit and run the line.

225
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:55,029
It's dumping gas! [Explosion]

226
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,998
- [sobs]
- Come on!

227
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,767
Go!

228
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,342
That's the driver.

229
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:09,777
Stop that guy.

230
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,215
Go!

231
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,719
I got him. I got him.

232
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,820
We got the driver.

233
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:20,855
He's in custody.

234
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,390
Cancel the dive.

235
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:25,227
No one is in the water.

236
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:30,831
It's okay.

237
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,099
- I'm scared.
- Let's get her out of here.

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at her jugular.

239
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,672
It's all right, sweetie.

240
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,042
Muffled heart sounds.

241
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,243
It's Beck's triad.

242
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,911
Come on, sweetie. Gentle.

243
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,280
Easy. Come on.

244
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:48,383
[sirens wail]

245

Time.

246
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,821
Less than two minutes.

247
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,356
[beeping]
I got P.E.A.

248
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,058
She's bleeding into the
bag around her heart.

249
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,360
I need to evacuate the blood.

250
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,015
- A minute and a half.
- She doesn't have

251
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,217
a minute and a half, Shay.

252
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,218
She's gonna be dead before we get there.

253
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,853
You got to wait, Dawson.

254
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:05,488
Pull over the damn rig now.

255

Come on. Come on.

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,798
Come on. Come on.

259
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,566
Damn it. I hit the heart.

260
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,902
Back it out slowly.

261
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:24,006
Slowly.

262
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:28,178
[beeping intensifies]

[tires squeal, siren wails]

265
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,003
Mediastinal hemorrhage.

266
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:51,672
I attempted pericardiocentesis
and saw PVCs.

267
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:53,074
You hit her heart with a needle?

268
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,009
I backed it out and evacuated
as much blood as I could.

269
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,811
Well, let's hope you didn't
kill her in the process.

270
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:57,845
Get her into three.

271
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,013
Call Dr. Nesbit upstairs

272
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,247
and tell him to prep for surgery.

273
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:03,050
Gabby, don't worry about him.
He's an ass.

274
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:05,353
And his wife's finally leaving
him, so there's that.

275
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:08,390
Thanks.

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,694
Say, lieutenant,

277
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,795
now that we have a new candidate,

278
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:15,896
I don't have to be Otis anymore.

279
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:17,164
You're still Otis.

280
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,100
But I thought I could
learn to drive the truck

281
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,035
and we could put Peter
Mills on the elevators.

282
00:13:21,036 --> 00:13:22,970
Herrmann, what's this guy's name?

283
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:24,872
- Otis.
- No, his real name.

284
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,775
Bart?

285
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:31,412
Brian. Brian Zvonecek.

286
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:32,713
He knew.

287
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:33,748
You're staying on the elevators,

288
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,750
which makes you Otis. Sorry.

289
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,652
Hey.

290
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,121
Guy in the water?

291
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,089
How about a guy with his head up his ass?

292
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,725
You handle your firefighters.
I'll handle mine.

293
00:13:44,726 --> 00:13:45,860
That's a good theory, Casey.

294
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,294
- How about giving it a try?
- Know what?

295
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:48,829
I'm getting real tired
of your Bull, Severide.

296
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,132
I don't give a damn what you're tired of.

297
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey.

298
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:54,368
I thought you all should
know I am gonna fight

299
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,737
that Dick Olmstead who slept with my wife

300
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,806
in Saturday's drop-a-cop.

301
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,175
Or we could all just throw
the gloves on right now,

302
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,410
beat the hell out of each other.

303
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,046
Maybe when the mayor comes on Saturday

304
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,847
that's what he sees.

305
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,250
Truck versus squad--

306
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:13,251
old as the CFD, so deal with it.

307
00:14:14,222 --> 00:14:18,222
We all lost Darden a month ago Friday.

308
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,295
And that ain't changing.

309
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:25,296
So maybe we should.

310
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:40,347
- Hey, Heather.
- Hey.

311
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,818
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

312
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,120
Thanks for meeting me out here.

313
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,922
I just can't go in there.

314
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,125
How are you?

315
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:57,933
I don't-- what do you want me to say?

316
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,402
So that's it, huh?

317
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:05,937
14 years at this station,
and it all fits into a box.

318
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:08,476
Heather, there's not
a single place I look

319
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:11,812
and don't see him.

320
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:14,381
Bells go off, and I think,
"The truck can't leave yet.

321
00:15:14,382 --> 00:15:18,018
Andy's not on it."

322
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,454
Why don't you and Hallie
and I get together?

323
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:24,455
I could use a Margarita-- or four.

324
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,961
Of course.

325
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,998
I'll have Hallie call you.

326
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,179

[engine starts]

328
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:00,795
- Kelly.
- Yeah?

329
00:16:00,796 --> 00:16:03,832
Come here.

330
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,573
Here.

331
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,046
- Thanks.
- Okay.

332
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,045
You okay, Dawson?

333
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,715
Uh, of course, yeah, yeah. It's, uh...

334
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:31,716
[sighs] some days, you know?

335
00:17:33,355 --> 00:17:37,355
Forget it. It's all good. You?

336
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,360
Uh, listen, some of us are going over

337
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:40,427
to Buzzard's tomorrow night

338
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,363
if you and Hallie wanna come.

339
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:46,364
We would, but, uh, we
do a date night thing.

340
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,869
Just us.

341
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,439
But maybe we'll try.

342
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,478
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.

343
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:06,987
[knock on door]

344
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:08,722
Mr. Herrmann? I'm David Talbott,

345
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,591
an attorney with the Sheriff's department.

346
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:13,127
Yeah. No problem. We're all out.

347
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,895
There's a dryer down in the basement

348
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:16,964
I couldn't get out by myself,
but otherwise, you know--

349
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,400
- We'll take care of it.

350
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:23,401
Oh, no, uh, we'll change the locks.

351
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:26,841
Yeah, right.

352
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,996
[knock at door]

353
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,632
Hey.

354
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:55,636
Pizza again?

355
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,806
You can't live like that.

356
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:03,610
Come on in.

357
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:07,649
I've only got a few
minutes before my shift.

358
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:17,221
I...I can't wear this if I'm
not still engaged to you.

359
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,865
Am I?

360
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,468
You tell anyone I moved out?

361
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:31,469
No. You?

362
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,807
No.

363
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:34,975
So what are we doing?

364
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,010
I'd marry you tomorrow, Hallie,

365
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,946
if I knew we wanted the same things.

366
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:39,980
I'm a resident, Matt.

367
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,048
I cannot start a family right now.

368
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,086
Yeah, that's been made perfectly clear.

369
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:51,088
So what are we doing?

370
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,963
I don't know.

371
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,101
Call me when you do.

372
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,611
Yo, Peter Mills!

373
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,980
My partner, Shay, she's
been asking about you.

374
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,114
Been talking about you all morning.

375
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,115
I heard she's a monster.

376
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:16,583
Dude I know over at 19,

377
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,985
he walked with a hitch for a week.

378
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:21,154
Ah, you guys are busting my balls.

379
00:20:21,155 --> 00:20:23,557
Listen to me, kid.

380
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,158
I just lost my house to foreclosure

381
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,094
because I took a bath in the market.

382
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,996
We're now living with my in-laws,

383
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,597
which is two bedrooms shy of unpleasant.

384
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,165
My wife won't take her birth control

385
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,034
because the Pope said if
she did, god would cry,

386
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,769
so I'm not having any sex.

387
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,604
So if there's any chance

388
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:40,073
that I could live vicariously through you,

389
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:42,310
it's literally all I got.

390
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:49,717
All right.

391
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,624
Hey.

392
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,259
- Hey.
- I'm Peter Mills.

393
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,828
Uh...Pete.
[chuckles]

394
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:04,131
Uh-huh. Peter Mills.

395
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,332
Can you hand me that box right there?

396
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,269
Uh, yeah.

397
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,139
Thanks.

398
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,908
So the little girl from the
bridge accident, she okay?

399
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,910
You really are new, aren't you?

400
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,712
Listen.

401
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:20,914
We get 'em to the doctor best we can,

402
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,182
and then we move on.

403
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,117
It's the only way to make it here.

404
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,054
Uh, yeah Yeah.

405
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:29,656
So, um... I was thinking--

406
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:32,926
I mean, I was wondering...

407
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,929
do you maybe wanna hook up for a beer

408
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,165
or dinner or something?

409
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,800
Peter Mills, are you gay?

410
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:41,802
Me? No.

411
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:43,904
Because I am.

412
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:47,905
[all giggling]

413
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,846
Dawson. Shay.

414
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:54,794
Which one of you put a
needle in the girl's heart?

415
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,766
Give me a minute.

416
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:13,837
Tell me what happened.

417
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:17,241
Her heart was stopping,
and we pulled over,

418
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:20,244
and I did what I had to do.

419
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:22,179
It was the right thing to do.

420
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,782
Chief surgeon at Lakeshore disagrees.

421
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:27,518
Do you know who your union rep is?

422
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,852
What?

423
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,188
Get him involved right
now, just as a precaution.

424
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:33,724
Maybe this goes away.

425
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,125
Just in case it doesn't.

426
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:38,662
Chief...

427
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:41,766
You two stick together.

428
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,305
How long were you the candidate here?

429
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,873
Not long, four years.

430
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,142
I can't believe we're gonna
miss the fights tonight.

431
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:53,877
Well, that's just as well,
'cause I just found out

432
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,579
he fought golden gloves.

433
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,314
That was 20 years ago, chief.
We gotta tape it or something.

434
00:22:57,315 --> 00:23:00,784
We gotta see it.

435
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:02,286
What's the lieutenant doing?

436
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,956
He said he wanted to cook
the Saturday corned beef.

437
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:09,226
Ah, look at that.

438
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:10,727
He made the best chicken parmigiana

439
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,162
I ever put in my mouth.

440
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,864
What do you got there, Casey?

441
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,299
Don't you worry about it.

442
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,335
Call everyone to chow.

443
00:23:18,903 --> 00:23:22,172
Hey, Casey's in there cooking.

444
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,009
- Casey?
- Yeah.

445
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:37,822
Have at it.

446
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:01,011
What the hell's going on? You okay?

447
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:02,079
'Cause if you're not, maybe you need to--

448
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,381
- You think I need your help?

449
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:06,917
I'm trying here, Severide.

450
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,987
Keep on.

451
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,726
I cleaned out Darden's locker.

452
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:18,695
You should have vented the back.

453
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:20,697
We're called the rescue squad, Casey.

454
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:22,165
We don't vent.

455
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:25,702
You shouldn't have put
Andy through the window.

456
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:27,104
I don't have to explain myself to you.

457
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,907
I sleep like a baby.

458
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:33,945
You?

459
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,753
Say, Herrmann.

460
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:44,721
You think maybe you just bought
a little too much house?

461
00:24:44,722 --> 00:24:47,824
I was preyed upon by
low-interest loan vultures.

462
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:49,059
What time is the mayor coming?

463
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,394
I heard 9:00.

464
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:52,129
I heard he stops to take a piss

465
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,397
at every house in the city,

466
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:55,198
- as a sign of respect.
- Stopped here in June.

467
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:59,199
Hey, Boden's about to
fight in ten minutes.

468
00:25:01,739 --> 00:25:03,740
Screw it.

469
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,042
Let's take a ride.

470
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:06,043
Take a ride. All right.

471
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:07,210
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

472
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:09,780
[bell dings]

473
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,915
[cheers and applause]
Fighting in the red corner,

474
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,150
for the Chicago fire department,

475
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:17,151
chief Bo-Bo-Bo-Boden.

476
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:19,723
Hello, sports fans.

477
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:21,425
This is Brian Zvonecek,

478
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:24,761
coming to you live from the
annual battle of the badges.

479
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:27,164
- Firefighters versus the police.
- What's that?

480
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,899
I hope you all are ready for this.

481
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,033
That's Otis.

482
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,202
Boden looks like a heat-seeking missile

483
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:33,804
as he climbs in the ring

484
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:36,707
to take on captain Olmstead from the cpd.

485
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,341
Olmstead, of course,

486
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:39,743
looks like the quivering
cop slob that he is.

487
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,044
[laughs]

488
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:44,047
Chief Boden first won back in 1992,

489
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:45,916
when he was part of the esteemed truck 81,

490
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,951
the greatest truck in all of Chicago.

491
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,987
Mouch.

492
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,155
I can't keep making excuses for ya.

493
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:53,223
[bell dings]

494
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:56,893
There goes the bell, and here we go.

495
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,228
Takes two quick jabs to the nose.

496
00:25:58,229 --> 00:25:59,362
