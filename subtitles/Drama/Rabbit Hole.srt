1
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,946
Becca?

2
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,376
Becca?

3
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,984
-Hey, Peg.
-lt looks so nice back here.

4
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,953
Well, l'm just, you know,
trying to get things back into shape.

5
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,756
Listen, we were wondering
if you and Howie were free tonight.

6
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,162
-We're having a few people over for dinner.
-That's very sweet of you, Peg.

7
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,394
-l know, it's really short notice.. .
-Actually, we have plans.

8
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,935
But another time, though?
Yeah, l haven't talked to Pete in ages.

9
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,773
You haven't missed much.
He's still the same SOB he always was.

10
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,175
Oh, God. l'm so sorry.

11
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,977
-lt's okay.
-l'm so sorry.

12
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,111
-No, no, no. No, it's fine.
-These stupid feet.

13
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,687
Well, have a great dinner, Peg.

14
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,825
-We'll do it again next time.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

15
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,433
-Say hi to Howie for me.
-l sure will.

16
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,034
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

17
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,727
-Smells good in there.
-Hey, if Peg asks, we went out tonight.

18
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,535
Where did we go?

19
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:33,470
-Saw the Stoppard play.
-Really? Did we enjoy it?

20
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,370
Very much.

21
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,571
She asked us to dinner again.

22
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:45,410
-She's just being nice.
-You're more than welcome to go over there.

23
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,322
-And abandon your risotto?
-Careful, Howie. The pan's hot.

24
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,168
-Hey.
-Hey. l'm gonna hop in the shower.

25
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,373
About 20 minutes.

26
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,259
Hello?

27
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,630
What time is it?

28
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,404
What's going on?

29
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,013
Thank you.

30
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,396
-Have you got nothing to say?
-Thank you?

31
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,459
-You were in a bar fight.
-lt wasn't a bar fight.

32
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,131
-You were in a bar fighting.
-lt wasn't a fight.

33
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,573
Some drunk girl was screaming in my face,
so l hit her and that was the end of it.

34
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,339
-Well, who was she?
-l don't know.

35
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,240
People don't just scream at you
for no reason.

36
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,443
Sure they do! You should get out more.

37
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,750
-God, lzzy, it's so Jerry Springer.
-What does that mean?

38
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,518
What, do you think l'm trashy?

39
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,250
You can't keep doing this.
You're not a kid anymore.

40
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,851
l didn't know there was a cut-off date.

41
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,729
Yeah, for acting like a jackass,
there's a cut-off date.

42
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,357
l want to stop worrying about you.

43
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,861
Hey, don't worry about me.
She was the one on the floor.

44
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,876
Can l stay with you tonight?

45
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,959
<i>l got you! l got you!</i>

46
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,224
<i>Danny, look at me when you turn back.</i>

47
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,730
<i>-He's getting juice.</i>
<i>-No, he's not.</i>

48
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,598
<i>Danny, look at this.</i>

49
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,101
<i>Now, Danny,</i>
<i>l'm gonna tell you a secret, okay?</i>

50
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,140
<i>When you go back down,</i>
<i>l want you to give Mom a big kiss, okay?</i>

51
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,075
<i>Ready? One, two, three. That was high!</i>

52
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,542
<i>-Danny, look at me when you come back.</i>
<i>-He's getting juice.</i>

53
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,244
<i>-You want any cake?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

54
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,479
<i>Do we have cake today?</i>

55
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,612
<i>-Yeah, we do.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

56
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,247
<i>-We do?</i>
<i>-No, it's brownies. Come on.</i>

57
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,122
<i>Oh, my gosh. You really want some.</i>

58
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,843
Well, if it isn't Ma Barker.

59
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,014
l'm sure that would be very funny
if l knew who that was.

60
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,424
Rick and l are gonna play squash.
l have my cell if you need me.

61
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:18,122
-Yeah.
-Squash. You go play squash, Howie.

62
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,860
-You don't even know what squash is.
-l don't care what squash is.

63
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,761
Hello?

64
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,639
Yeah. Yeah!

65
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,107
She's gonna kill me.

66
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,206
Yeah, l know.
l think Auggie must have told her.

67
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,677
Hey, l gotta go. Bye.

68
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,550
Thank you, Becca.

69
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,752
l know what this stuff is now.

70
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,760
-l like the way it cracks.
-Of course you do.

71
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,954
So, did you know that woman?

72
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,533
My God, why are you listening
to my phone conversations?

73
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:00,368
-You're sleeping with the girl's boyfriend.
-lt's been over between them!

74
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,997
They're just living together
because of the rent.

75
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,010
-Then why did she accost you?
-Because she's a lunatic.

76
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,011
And Auggie must have told her
that l'm pregnant.

77
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,048
-You are not.
-You're gonna love him.

78
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,318
He's a really.. .
He's a great guy. He's a musician.

79
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,290
-Well, that's terrific.
-Yeah, he works.

80
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,057
He gets work as a musician.

81
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,499
-How long have you known?
-A few weeks.

82
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,266
Did you tell Mom?

83
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,600
Come on. You told Mom before me?

84
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,197
-l had to.
-Why didn't you tell me?

85
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,334
Why do you think?

86
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,743
l'm sorry, Becca.
l know the timing really sucks.

87
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,548
What are you gonna do?
l'm just glad you finally told me.

88
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,749
Debbie has been driving me crazy
with these kitchen renovations.

89
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,683
l tell you, the countertop negotiations alone.

90
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,482
l told you not to marry an agent.

91
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,821
She still hasn't called, you know.

92
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,458
No, l know.

93
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,624
l mean, l don't mean to be a pest about it,

94
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,361
but l just know Becca
would love to hear from her.

95
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,767
l know. l tell her, Howie, l do.

96
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,400
But she's still.. .

97
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,843
l don't know. Freaked out, l guess.

98
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,508
-lt's been eight months.
-l know. l'll talk to her.

99
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,849
Thank you. Hey, how are the kids?

100
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,153
They're good.

101
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,983
Emily's doing ballet. Robbie is in T-ball.

102
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,858
T-ball.

103
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:13,429
Hey, have you guys talked at all
about having another?

104
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,698
No.

105
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,579
No, it's a little soon.

106
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,081
-Just be a little open. That's all l'm asking.
-l'm here, aren't l?

107
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,959
-Hey.
-How's it going?

108
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,398
Good, good. We're hanging in there.

109
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,993
-You sure?
-Yeah.

110
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,572
-Hey, Kevin.
-Hi. Hi.

111
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,834
Yeah, we.. . We just.. .

112
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,980
We found out
that Becca's sister is pregnant, so.. .

113
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,140
-Howie.
-What?

114
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,912
That can be hard.
l remember when my cousin got pregnant.

115
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,818
Yeah, it's not really a big deal.

116
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,946
Okay.

117
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,224
lf you want to talk about it, though,
you know, the group's here, so.. .

118
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,387
Yeah, no, l don't think so.

119
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,461
-''Hey, everybody, fresh meat.' '
-Becca, be nice.

120
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,297
Doesn't she remind you of Lydia?

121
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,837
There was this woman in our group
a couple of years ago.

122
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,635
lt was four. Four years ago.

123
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,210
You know,
it doesn't really matter when she was here.

124
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,109
My point is, is that she reminds me of Lydia.

125
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,413
She really wasn't
into the support-group model at first.

126
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,648
-So, how long have you been in group?
-lt'll be eight years in June.

127
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:44,053
l didn't.. . l didn't realize it was that long.

128
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,228
You know, we're the veterans.
You know, for us it's.. .

129
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:52,896
lt's a good way to touch base.
Everyone's on a different schedule.

130
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,432
Of course. Of course.

131
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,077
She.. . You know,
she visits me sometimes in dreams

132
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,251
and she tells me it's okay,

133
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:12,719
that she's with God.
And we had some good days,

134
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:20,062
and you think that when you have enough
good days, it actually is gonna get better.

135
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,658
You know, it does get better and then.. .

136
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,361
-lt was her anniversary last week and.. .
-A year last Tuesday.

137
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,800
And it just starts all over again.

138
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,548
We just have to remind each other that.. .

139
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,649
-lt's just part of God's plan.
-Yeah.

140
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,620
And we can't know why.

141
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,151
You know, only God can know why.

142
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,598
God had to take her.
He needed another angel.

143
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,269
He needed another angel.

144
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,533
Why didn't he just make one?
Another angel.

145
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,939
l mean, he's God, after all.

146
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,638
Why didn't he just make another angel?

147
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:17,548
Just.. .

148
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,884
Just putting it out there.

149
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,556
l'd like to go.

150
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,594
l think we're gonna go.
ls that all right, honey?

151
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,444
Excuse us.

152
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,418
They're talking, it's their time,
and you have to respect that.

153
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,352
-Come on.
-l mean, you sit there for weeks

154
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,549
and you don't say a word.. .

155
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,422
l'm sorry. l can't stand the God freaks.
You know that.

156
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,654
But they're not all like that.
Kevin and Gaby aren't.

157
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,197
No. Kevin and Gaby
are professional wallowers.

158
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,860
l mean, come on. Eight years, Howie. Eight.

159
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,467
lf that's what you want to become, then.. .

160
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,063
-lf you want to take a break.. .
-No, not a break. l'm done.

161
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,735
-l know that lzzy stuff got under your skin.
-Please don't do that. Please.

162
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:18,476
One semester of psychology 15 years ago
and suddenly you can analyze.. .

163
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,642
Jesus, Becca.

164
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,379
l don't like the group.

165
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,615
-l gave it a try. lt's not for me.
-Okay.

166
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,116
lt's not for you.

167
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,457
Thank you.

168
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:37,194
Do you mind if we not eat here,
'cause nothing's really jumping out at me.

169
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,119
Taz! Stop, stop. Come here and eat.
Come on. Come on.

170
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,486
Stay. Sorry, he's not really dangerous. Eat.

171
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,792
-Yeah.
-He's just kind of dumb.

172
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,833
No, l know. He's my dog.

173
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,133
You're Becca.

174
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,265
l should have recognized you, of course.
l'm Auggie.

175
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,475
-Hi, Auggie.
-Hi.

176
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,273
Oh, my God!

177
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,678
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming over?

178
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,047
l would have picked up the house.

179
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,383
-That's Auggie.
-Yeah, we met. ls lzzy here?

180
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,218
Yeah, she's here.
She got fired from Applebee's.

181
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,988
l was planning on taking
it all down to Goodwill,

182
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,829
but now l'm glad that l didn't,
because look at these shirts.

183
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:49,958
Look at them. And these sweaters.. .

184
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,697
l don't know, Becca.
l mean, they're in baby clothes for so long.

185
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,205
lt'll probably be a while
before he can even fit into that stuff.

186
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,266
No. lt comes up very quickly, you'll see.
You're gonna be happy that l saved it.

187
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,506
-ls he living here?
-He has to. His girlfriend kicked him out.

188
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,140
-Ex-girlfriend.
-She knows what l meant.

189
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,687
-Did you see this one?
-That's cute. Look at that.

190
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,980
What if it's a girl?

191
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,889
Well, then.. .
l don't know, l'll give it to someone else.

192
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,221
But you're gonna.. . You're gonna thank me.

193
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,387
There's a couple of years' worth
of clothes here.

194
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,055
Think of all the money you're gonna save.

195
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,100
-lt's not about the money.
-Well, it should be.

196
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,763
Come on, lzzy.
You gotta start thinking about that.

197
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:31,605
l mean, especially if the dad's a musician.
lt costs a lot to raise a child, l'm telling you.

198
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,304
lt would just be weird, Becca,

199
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,678
if it was a boy, to see him running around
in Danny's clothes.

200
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,483
l would just feel weird about it.

201
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,791
Yeah.

202
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,895
-l'm sorry. Of course it would be weird.
-lt was a nice offer.

203
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,526
You're gonna get a lot of clothes.
Christmas, birthdays.

204
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,196
-You don't have anything to worry about.
-lt's probably a girl, anyway.

205
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,432
You know,
l'm a little psychic about these things.

206
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:07,274
Remember, l said Sheila was having a girl?
And Karin!

207
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:12,180
-l think there's a girl in there.
-l hope there is. l mean, l want a girl.

208
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,685
l want it to be healthy, obviously,
but l really hope it's a girl.

209
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,981
Me, too.

210
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,489
You want some coffee cake?
l've got some coffee cake for us.

211
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,025
l'm actually gonna take off

212
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,824
because l promised Howie
that l'd pick up some dinner.

213
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,626
Looks good, though.

214
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,571
Here. Eat some cake.

215
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,661
-When did Rick ever beat me at squash?
-Did he mention Debbie at all?

216
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,398
You can call her, you know.
Get the reports directly.

217
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,706
l don't want to call her. She should call me.

218
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,811
l would have been there for her if anything
had ever happened to Robbie or Em.

219
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,280
l wouldn't have vanished the way she did.

220
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,628
l wouldn't.

221
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,457
Howie?

222
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,397
You know what l mean?

223
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,544
Yeah.

224
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,727
Howie.

225
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,639
Turn around.

226
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,310
Come on. You need to relax.

227
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,961
-Your shoulders are all knotted up.
-Yeah.

228
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,058
Yeah.

229
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,332
Forget about Debbie

230
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,437
and whatever else is bothering you.

231
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,706
l know what this is. Dimming the lights.. .

232
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,277
You're trying to seduce me.

233
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,947
You're plying me with.. . With liquor.

234
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,489
lt worked in college.

235
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,859
That's enough. That's enough.

236
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,600
Where are you going?

237
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,902
No, l just.. . l'm feeling antsy tonight.
l'm sorry. lt just.. . lt was a weird day.

238
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,647
-Right.
-What, now you're gonna pout?

239
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,873
-lt's been eight months.
-But who's keeping track?

240
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,508
l am. l'm keeping track.

241
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:19,090
l'm not ready yet, Howie. All right? l'm just.. .

242
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,020
l'm sorry if you think that that's abnormal.

243
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,063
l don't.
l don't think it's abnormal at all, but.. .

244
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,222
So, what's the problem?

245
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,460
We need to at least head in that direction,
which might feel strange at first, but.. .

246
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,969
-But you want to have sex.
-Don't say it like that.

247
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:37,064
-You're trying to rope me into having sex.
-l am not. l wasn't roping you into sex.

248
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,802
-Al Green isn't roping?
-No.

249
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,777
-Al Green?
-l thought it was nice. That's all.

250
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,881
l was trying to make things nice.

251
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,918
You can't. You just can't, all right?

252
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,250
l'm sorry. Things aren't nice anymore.

253
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,690
<i>Babe, will you hold him for a second?</i>
<i>Just hold him like that.</i>

254
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,267
<i>-Taz, quit it.</i>
<i>-Yeah, tell Taz to quit it.</i>

255
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,064
<i>-All right. Now...</i>
<i>-'Cause Taz wants to go on the tire.</i>

256
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,904
<i>-Hold on. Let me see Mama and...</i>
<i>-Okay, you ready? l'm gonna let you go.</i>

257
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,203
<i>-Ready?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

258
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,279
<i>Here it goes. There!</i>

259
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,211
<i>-Keep your feet up.</i>
<i>-Danny.</i>

260
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,581
<i>-Look at me on the way back, Danny.</i>
<i>-Keep your feet up, Danny.</i>

261
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,667
Hey.

262
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:52,410
lf you're not gonna go to group,
l need you to see someone.

263
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,055
-Any plans for the day?
-You're looking at them.

264
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,261
-l'll see you tonight.
-Yeah.

265
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,999
l'm here to see Scott Baiter
in the Events department.

266
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,904
l don't have a Baiter listed.

267
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,014
That's weird.

268
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:37,779
-Kate Finn. What about Kate?
-l have a Robert Finn in Dec Arts.

269
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,588
lf you have an appointment,
l can just call up there.

270
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,059
Who are you?

271
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:51,066
l.. . l don't have an appointment. l.. .
l'm an old friend. l used to work here.

272
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,397
Becca?

273
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,305
-Gary!
-Hey! What are you doing here?

274
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,177
l had some errands to run in the city and l.. .

275
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,579
l thought l'd pop in and say hello,
but apparently nobody works here anymore.

276
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:10,485
Yeah, no, Scott went over to Christie's
back in March. Traitor.

277
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,516
lt's good to see
you're still doing the coffee runs, though.

278
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,686
No. No, no, no. l don't usually.
l'm in Scott's old job.

279
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,167
-Hey, how's the family?
-You know what, Gary, l.. .

280
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,065
l know how busy it gets up there,
so l'm gonna let you get back to it.

281
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,471
Yeah, that hasn't changed.

282
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,566
-lt was great to see you, though.
-You, too.

283
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,824
-There are fines, you know?
-No, l know.

284
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,265
The book's quite overdue.
We sent out several notices.

285
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,963
-Yeah, that's why l'm here.
-$7.00.

286
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,441
Thank you.

287
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,626
Can l help you?

288
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,588
Yeah, actually. Would it be possible
for me to check this out?

289
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,331
Certainly.

290
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,146
'''l will become a fish in a trout stream
and l will swim away from you.' ''

291
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,115
-He's an iguana.
-Yeah, he is.

292
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,687
'''lf you become a fish in a trout stream,'
said his mother,

293
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,724
'''l will become a fisherman
and l will fish for you.. .' ''

294
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,793
Sorry.

295
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,594
What do you think's gonna happen?

296
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,095
-l don't know.
-Let's see.

297
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,460
-Hey.
-Hey.

298
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:39,131
l just scored Yankee tickets off of Rowan.
Tonight. You interested?

299
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,039
-l can't. l got group.
-You can't skip one night?

300
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,341
They're right behind home plate.

301
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,473
-Another time.
-lf there is one.

302
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,055
-You going stag tonight?
-Yeah.

303
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,456
No. Becca, she's.. .
She's gonna take a little break.

304
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,585
From the group.

305
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,863
l'm gonna get a coffee.

306
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,532
-Want to sit?
-Yeah.

307
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,104
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom. lt's me.

308
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,012
-What's wrong?
<i>-Nothing.</i>

309
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:30,515
l was thinking about making
lzzy's birthday cake. Would that be all right?

310
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,487
Honey, you don't have to do all that.

311
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,991
l was just gonna grab her
one of those Carvel things. She likes those.

312
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,394
l don't mind. l really don't.
l mean, it will give me something to do.

313
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,863
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

314
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,467
No group tonight?

315
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,061
Howie's there. lt's too much God talk for me.

316
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,709
-What?
<i>-Nothing. lt's just that...</i>

317
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,845
You know,
some people find that comforting.

318
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,712
Yeah, well, it pisses me off.

319
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,685
You know, Becca, when your brother died,
l found the church very helpful.

320
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:08,122
l know. l know you did, but that's you.
That's not me, and Danny.. .

321
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,221
Danny isn't Arthur.

322
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,489
You know,
l brought you to church every Sunday.

323
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,225
Let's not start this again, okay, Mom?

324
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,497
l'm just.. . l'm just calling about the cake.

325
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,004
You're not right about everything,
you know?

326
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,233
-What if there is a God?
-Then l'd say he's a sadistic prick.

327
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,804
-All right, Becca, that's enough.
-''Worship me and l'll treat you like shit.' '

328
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,983
No wonder you like him.
He sounds just like Dad.

329
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,189
l'm sorry.

330
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,521
You're gonna do the cake, then?

331
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,290
Yeah.

332
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,502
All right, l'll see you tomorrow.

333
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,706
Who has a birthday party
in a bowling alley, anyway?

334
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,144
l mean, lzzy thinks she's still 1 4.

335
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,939
lf you're not up for this, we don't have to go.

336
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,541
No, it's just a party. l'm fine.

337
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,718
l wish you'd take that thing out of here.

338
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,794
We're hardly in this car.
What's the difference?

339
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,627
lt's weird. lt feels weird.

340
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,771
What if we gave it another try?

341
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,100
-What?
-Another baby?

342
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,904
l mean, we're not getting any younger.

343
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,842
ls that what the sex thing
was about the other night?

344
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,278
-No.
-You're trying to get me pregnant.

345
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,179
Becca, no, of course not.

346
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,515
l know it's scary, but maybe it might

347
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,083
-help us get back on track.
-On track?

348
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,352
What, we can't talk about it?

349
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,821
l think we should sell the house.

350
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,160
l've been thinking about it,
and since we're on the topic.. .

351
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,200
What? What do you mean?
How are we on the topic?

352
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,292
l talked to a realtor,
and she thinks we can pull together.. .

353
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,498
-What do you mean, talked to a realtor?
-.. .an open house pretty quickly, and then.. .

354
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,905
Why would you talk to a realtor
without telling me?

355
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,977
l'm telling you now.

356
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,172
You want us to get back on track,
l think it would help if we moved.

357
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,511
-We love that house.
-He's everywhere, Howie.

358
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,551
l can see his fingerprints on the door jams.

359
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,847
-l see puzzles, l see his highchair.
-l like seeing his fingerprints.

360
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,252
Yeah, but that's because you don't have
to sit and stare at it all day.

361
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,847
You get to go to work. You get to escape.

362
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,926
-Yeah, but l don't want to move!
-l don't want another baby!

363
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,819
Jesus!

364
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,602
-What are you doing?
-What do you think l'm doing?

365
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,831
l just had to check the cake. lt's fine.

366
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,972
Are you kidding? The Kennedys?

367
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,946
With the assassinations
and the lobotomies?

368
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,141
-Yeah.
-Right here.

369
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,413
Yeah. That's not a curse, though.

370
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,921
-lt's just bad luck.
-The plane crashes?

371
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,618
Too much money. That's their curse.

372
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,859
lf those Kennedys lived like normal people,
most of them would still be alive.

373
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,693
l think it's sad.

374
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,361
All those good-looking people
falling out of the sky like that.

375
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,398
lt's a frigging waste.

376
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,233
-Didn't l say no wine?
-She brought it herself.

377
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,239
lsn't this nice?
Just sitting around talking politics like this?

378
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,405
l never do this. lt's a nice change.

379
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,447
-Let's do gifts.
-Yes.

380
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,245
-Yeah, gifts!
-All right!

381
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,050
-Yes!
-Okay.

382
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,521
-lt's heavy.
-So pretty. l hate to ruin it, but l will.

383
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,829
lt's a bathroom set.

384
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,659
More of a practical gift.

385
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:42,330
ls this your way of telling me you don't like
my Three Stooges shower curtain?

386
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,441
-l didn't know what to get you, so.. .
-Seriously, it's great.

387
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,809
-Say thank you.
-Thank you, Becca. Thank you, Howie.

388
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,748
-Don't thank me, Becca picked it out.
-Now me.

389
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,644
-Thank you.
-l know it's a little early, but.. .

390
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,556
-Oh, my God!
-Lovely.

391
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,623
So sweet. Thank you, Mama.

392
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,497
l thought we weren't doing baby stuff
for the birthday.

393
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,799
l thought we were doing it.. .
We were waiting for the shower.

394
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,602
No, honey, it's not baby stuff,
it's mommy stuff.

395
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,438
This is perfect, Bec.
l needed a bathroom set.

396
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:24,140
-Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.
-We can take it back.

397
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,840
-That's right, we should.
-No.

398
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,975
l'm gonna get you a basket
of Mustela lotions.

399
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,814
-They prevent stretch marks.
-No. Becca, let it go.

400
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,616
You can get me the lotion another time.

401
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,385
-No, come on.
-You can get me the lotion another time!

402
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,428
l got it, l got it. lt's okay. lt's all right.

403
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,223
-l didn't.. .
-Thank you. Thank you, Becca.

404
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:48,062
Here.

405
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,508
l just remembered what l was gonna say
about Aristotle Onassis.

406
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,951
lt was about the son
who died in a plane crash.

407
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,044
Are you ready to go?

408
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,748
You should have stopped him
from going off

409
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,884
on all that Kennedy stuff,
because my point was Onassis

410
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:14,362
and how he put up a reward
to anyone who could prove

411
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,559
that someone had sabotaged
his son's plane.

412
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:21,536
He was so desperate to blame somebody.
Did you read this?

413
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:28,868
-He needed a reason for losing his son.
-Mom, why are you telling this story?

414
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,977
-l'm just talking. l can't talk?
-You never just talk.

415
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,076
You guys, thanks for coming to my party.
Becca, the cake was so good.

416
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,883
You forget what l went through
when your brother died.

417
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,254
You think l don't know anything,
but l do, Becca.

418
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,726
-Like who to blame?
-Guys, please. lt's my birthday party.

419
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,560
-No, let it go. That's their stuff.
-No, l'm not talking about blame.

420
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,827
-l'm talking about comfort.
-Comfort.

421
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,165
-Where are you getting it?
-Comfort? l'm not.

422
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,238
Well, l think you should.

423
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,239
Okay, well, let me get on that
and see what l can dig up on eBay.

424
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,866
l'm just trying to help you, Becca.

425
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,105
You know, l wish somebody had given me
a little advice when Arthur died.

426
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,203
You know what l wish?

427
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,840
l wish you would stop comparing Danny
to Arthur.

428
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,384
-Becca.
-Danny was a 4-year-old boy

429
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,010
who chased his dog into the street,

430
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,056
and Arthur was a 30-year-old heroin addict
who OD'd.

431
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,457
Frankly, l resent
how you keep lumping them together, Mom.

432
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,552
He was still my son.

433
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,943
We're gonna go.
l hope you enjoy the bathroom set, lzzy.

434
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,012
l'm gonna.

435
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,455
When Arthur died
l was just as upset as she was,

436
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,620
but l didn't take it out on other people.

437
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,056
What about Mrs. Bailey?

438
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,630
Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey.

439
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,830
-Hey, did you call that guy about the roof?
-No, l couldn't find the number.

440
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:37,333
Becca, it's in my phone. lt's on the mantle.

441
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,002
What's his name?

442
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,542
lt's not under his name.

443
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,886
Then how am l supposed to call him if l.. .

444
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,478
-lt's under ''roof guy.' '
-''Roof guy.' '

445
00:39:54,692 --> 00:40:00,062
-Well, what was l supposed to put it under?
-l don't know how to use this.

446
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:07,696
-lt doesn't.. .
-No. Okay, now scroll down.

447
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,070
-Now what? You do it.
-Scroll down with your finger.

448
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,439
-Roof guy.
-Thank you.

449
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,038
You're welcome.

450
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,132
Are you waiting for me?

451
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,765
Yeah. Yeah, l'm sorry.
l thought that you took the bus.

452
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,401
-l do.
-But not today.

453
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,513
Not today. l skipped school.

454
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,447
Well, you shouldn't be playing hooky,
young man.

455
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,352
Why are you waiting for me?

456
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,963
l thought we could talk.

457
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,923
About what?

458
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,033
-ls this okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

459
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,812
-Not too weird?
-No.

460
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,543
l mean.. .

461
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,013
No, l know, it's.. .

462
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,486
lt's weird for me, too.

463
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,024
-Don't you like school?
-l like it all right.

464
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:43,360
l just thought 'cause you.. .
l don't know, you seem to not be going, so.. .

465
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:46,800
l've been accepted to college already, so.. .

466
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:51,032
-Not a big deal, then.
-No, it is a big deal,

467
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,575
but only if my mother finds out.

468
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:58,141
She said she would confiscate my phone
if l did it again.

469
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,581
Not that l use my phone anyway.

470
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,845
-So, where are you headed?
-Connecticut College.

471
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,047
Right. That's a good school. Not far.

472
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:11,786
l bet your parents are pleased
that you're gonna be close by.

473
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:15,297
lt's just my mom, but, yeah,
she's pretty happy about it.

474
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,230
She keeps saying she's gonna apply
to the grad program

475
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,564
so she can keep an eye on me
while l'm up there.

476
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,506
-She's just joking, though.
-Yeah.

477
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:26,235
She's not really looking forward to it,
'cause l'm the only one at home now,

478
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:30,473
but l told her l'd come home
on the weekends and stuff if l could.

479
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,980
Well, that'll be nice.

480
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,016
So.. .

481
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,259
l'm sorry.

482
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,592
l know.

483
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,027
-You don't have to.. .
-l know that doesn't help.

484
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,333
No, it does, it really does, but.. .

485
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,931
-l know l should have tried to get in touch.. .
-lt's fine.

486
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,348
l just really wish l had driven down
a different block that day.

487
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,311
l know.

488
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,083
You know, l should maybe go.

489
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,217
lt's all right.

490
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,232
No, l gotta.. . My mom's gonna start
to wonder where l'm at.

491
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,261
lt's okay. You really don't have to. lt's.. .

492
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,007
Can we do this again sometime?

493
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,444
Sure.

494
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,272
Okay.

495
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,020
Jesus Christ.

496
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,715
-Hey, Gaby.
-l can't.. . l know.

497
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,883
God, l can't believe you just saw me do that.

498
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,184
l didn't mean to sneak up on you.

499
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:30,528
l thought something was wrong,
but, obviously, everything smells fine.

500
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:34,001
You can smell it, huh? God.

501
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,038
-Everyone in there's gonna know.
-Nah.

502
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,135
-l swear l never do this.
-Where's Kevin?

503
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,775
He's not coming to group.

504
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,047
And l blame your wife, by the way,
'cause l think she put the idea in his head.

505
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,878
Yeah, well, he didn't really seem
to like group all that much.

506
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:58,186
God, you know, he's got me so upset.
l mean, like, look at me. l'm.. . l'm.. .

507
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,956
l am smoking pot in a parking lot.

508
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,763
lt's like l'm in high school. lt's.. .
l'm ridiculous.

509
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,632
You got any more?

510
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:11,665
Yeah.

511
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,639
Come on in, partner.

512
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,672
Well, if today is rage day,

513
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:26,752
most of you know that l'm a little bit
more comfortable with rage,

514
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,552
talking about rage.

515
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,826
l deal with rage every single day.

516
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,458
l listen to guys at work going on and on

517
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,835
about paving their driveways or whatever.
Stupid nonsense.

518
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:52,813
They don't know.
They haven't had their lives ripped apart yet.

519
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,682
-They're not in the club.
-Exactly.

520
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,513
Meanwhile, l'm like,

521
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:03,186
''Hey, guys, my daughter died of leukemia.' '

522
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,031
l'm sorry. l have to get some water.

523
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,407
You're one of those bad kids
my mother warned me about.

524
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:25,312
Yes, yeah, l am corrupting you.
But don't worry, l won't tell Becca.

525
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,612
l'd appreciate that.

526
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,978
-Bye.
-Good night.

527
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:42,993
Becca?

528
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,829
-Becca? What'd you do here?
-What?

529
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:49,205
-God damn it.
-What?

530
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,901
-What'd you do to my phone?
-Jesus, Howie, l thought something had.. .

531
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,070
This morning, when you used it,
what did you do to my phone?

532
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,306
Nothing, l just.. .

533
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,939
-l just got the number for the roof guy.
-For God's sake.

534
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,814
-What? You told me to call him.
-You deleted Danny's video.

535
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,746
No. No, l didn't. No.

536
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,586
l just.. . You were right there.
l just got the number.

537
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,126
Yeah, and you kept pressing the screen.

538
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,253
Because l couldn't figure out
how to use your phone.

539
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,831
-l checked already, it's gone.
-We have 100 videos of him.

540
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,366
That's not the point, Becca.

541
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,298
Then.. . Then you should
have put it on your computer.

542
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,930
-Right, right, it's my fault.
-l didn't say that.

543
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,737
-l said it's gone!
-Jesus, Howie! l didn't do it on purpose!

544
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,404
-Are you sure?
-What does that mean?

545
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,674
What, you think l deliberately
deleted his video?

546
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:32,976
l don't know.

547
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,184
-You don't know?
-lt's like you're trying to get rid of him.

548
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,154
l'm sorry, but that's how it feels.
Every day it's something new.

549
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,417
-Really?
-Yeah.

550
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,494
lt's like you're trying to get rid
of any evidence he was ever here.

551
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,723
-What? You took the paintings off the fridge.
-To save them.

552
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,167
-To save them. They are in a box downstairs.
-Okay, his clothes.

553
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,600
We don't need all that stuff, Howie.
We just don't.

554
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,468
You wanting to sell the house.
Your sending Taz to your mother's.

555
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,564
There's a lot going on.
The dog got underfoot.

556
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,610
-Right. And he was a reminder.
-Yes, yes, he is a reminder.

557
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,045
-And since you never wanted the dog.. .
-l wanted one less reminder. For God's sake.

558
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,708
lf l hadn't bought the dog,
Danny would still be alive.

559
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:11,584
lf l hadn't have run back in to get the phone,
if l had latched that gate.. .

560
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,916
l left the gate unlatched!

561
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,390
Come on, l'm not playing this game again,
Howie, l'm not!

562
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,519
-lt's no one's fault, and l'm not.. .
-Not even the dog's!

563
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,064
Dogs chase squirrels! Boys chase dogs!

564
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,895
-l know that.
-He loved that dog and you got rid of it!

565
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:26,526
Just like l'm getting rid of the video, huh?

566
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,765
lt's not about the video, Becca.
lt's not about the video!

567
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,239
lt's not just the video,
it's about Taz and the paintings

568
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:35,607
and his clothes and everything!
There's no pictures of him around!

569
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,510
There's no fingerprints! There's nothing!
God damn it!

570
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,651
You have to stop erasing him!
You have to stop it!

571
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:47,156
Do you really think that l don't see him
every second of every day?

572
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:53,061
The video was an accident, Howie,
and believe me,

573
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,529
l will beat myself up about it forever,
l'm sure,

574
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,259
just like everything else
l could have prevented.

575
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,461
-That's not what l want, Becca.
-No? Because it feels like it is.

576
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:03,664
lt feels like maybe
l don't feel badly enough for you.

577
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,210
Maybe l'm not feeling enough.
What do you want from me?

578
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,051
Something's got to change, because this.. .

579
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,483
l can't do this like this anymore. lt's.. .

580
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:25,224
lt's too hard. lt's too hard.

581
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,926
And l want that dog back.

582
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,428
-Your mother's making him fat.
-Howie.

583
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:41,870
l miss the dog.
l'm sorry, but l miss him. l want him back.

584
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,043
-Did you really make these?
-l did.

585
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,312
That's good.

586
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,885
-They're still warm.
-l'm glad you like them.

587
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,929
l've been reading that book,
the parallel universe book.

588
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,232
Yeah? Did you like it?

589
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,706
Yeah. lt's interesting. l don't know if l buy it,

590
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:50,037
the whole alternate reality thing, l just.. .
l don't know.

591
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,645
But it's interesting.

592
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:58,110
-Did you have to do it for a school project?
-No, it's research.

593
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,185
Research?

594
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,795
lt's a comic book.

595
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,571
lt's impressive.

596
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,740
-Did you do all of this?
-Yeah.

597
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,177
Wow. lt's amazing.

598
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:28,250
-What's it about?
-A scientist, l guess, and his son. The.. .

599
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:34,447
The father discovers this network of holes
that leads to other galaxies and.. .

600
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:40,053
-Parallel universes.
-Yeah, and, well, the scientist dies,

601
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:44,497
so the son has to go into this rabbit hole

602
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,901
to try and find him,
but it's not him because he's dead,

603
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,906
so it's, like, another version of him.

604
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,483
lt's kind of stupid.

605
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,747
-No.
-No? Okay.

606
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,346
Not at all. l would love to read it.

607
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:16,457
Yeah, it's.. . Sorry. lt's not.. .
lt's not done yet, but when it is done, l will.. .

608
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,089
l will let you read it.

609
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,190
-Okay.
-Okay.

610
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,637
l don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

611
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,513
l.. . l.. .

612
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,879
l might have been going too fast

613
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,517
on that day.

614
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,286
l mean, l'm not sure, but l might have been,

615
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,722
so that's something
l've been wanting to tell you.

616
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,298
lt's a 30 zone,
and l might have been going 31 or 32.

617
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,330
l usually look down and check,
and if l'm going over

618
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:56,803
then l would slow down, obviously,

619
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,001
but l don't remember checking
on your block.

620
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:06,445
So, it's possible
that l was going too fast and.. .

621
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,382
And.. . Well, the dog ran out really fast,
you know?

622
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:18,461
So l swerved. l didn't know.

623
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,430
l didn't know.

624
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,770
l thought you should know,

625
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:32,165
l might have been going
a little over the limit,

626
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:34,971
and l can't be positive.

627
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,780
-Okay.
-Okay.

628
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,775
Yeah.

629
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,478
All right.

630
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,383
Okay.

631
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,856
Thank you.

632
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,852
l don't want to go in there.

633
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,301
Yes, yes, yes!

634
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,379
-l'm sorry. lt was.. .
-Be nice.

635
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,550
-My God.
-Come on.

636
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,925
-l'm sorry, you suck.
-l would be doing better,

637
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,932
but your pot messed up
my depth perception.

638
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,870
-All right.
-Yeah.

639
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,463
l'm gonna support that one.
l'm totally gonna support that one.

640
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:12,871
Thank you.

641
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,176
Hey. You know what?
l have a confession to make.

642
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,683
-Remember when l said Kevin left group?
-Yeah.

643
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,718
What l meant to say was

644
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,389
he left me.

645
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:34,093
He left me.

646
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,798
Yeah, l.. .

647
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,669
l came home and he was gone.

648
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,939
-God, no note or.. .
-No. God, there was a note. Well, not.. .

649
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,711
Not a note so much as a manifesto

650
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:59,252
on all the ways
that we were destroying each other.

651
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,457
l'm sorry.

652
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,629
l mean, this is how it generally goes, right?

653
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,495
lt changes you. lt literally changes people.

654
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,196
You know,
a part of me thinks it was inevitable.

655
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,636
l love my wife.

656
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,710
Of course you do.

657
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,850
l love her very much.

658
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,450
Okay.

659
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:57,642
l.. . l think you're right. We should maybe

660
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,742
look into selling the house.

661
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,920
lt's probably for the best.

662
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,614
Okay.

663
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,608
Don't do that. Quick as a Band-Aid
or we'll never get through this. Here.

664
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,517
<i>Hi, kids.</i>
<i>Welcome to the light-up alphabet apple.</i>

665
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,753
<i>-Hi, kids...</i>
-l don't know how to turn it off.

666
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,989
Only people without children
give gifts like this.

667
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,861
<i>-Come on. Come on. Goodbye.</i>
-Goodbye.

668
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,231
<i>l hope you'll visit again soon.</i>

669
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,599
-So, have you heard from Debbie yet?
-Nope.

670
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,609
That's too bad.

671
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:06,808
Although, it can be worse the other way.
You know, l remember when Arthur died.. .

672
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,213
You can say his name.

673
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,585
-Can l?
-Yes.

674
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:13,485
You know, l don't know your rules.
l don't want to get scolded again.

675
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,787
You can talk about Arthur.
l just don't like the comparisons.

676
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,722
Okay.

677
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:26,624
-So, how's it worse?
-You remember Maureen Bailey?

678
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,269
Yeah.

679
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:33,069
Well, l couldn't get rid of her
after your brother passed away.

680
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,576
-She was always at the house.
-Yeah, l remember that.

681
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,842
Yeah, well, you know,
l never had a moment to myself,

682
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,076
so finally,
in the middle of coffee one afternoon,

683
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,779
l said, ''Maureen, why are you always here?''

684
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,719
-And what'd she say?
-She said,

685
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,917
''l want to be there, Nat.
l want to share in your grief.' '

686
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,586
And l said, ''Well, it's not working.

687
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,163
''You plant your fat ass in that chair
every fricking day.' '

688
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,391
You did not say that!

689
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,523
-l did.
-Mom!

690
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,465
-l did say that.
-You said ''fat ass''?

691
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,730
She sucks up all my coffee.

692
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:05,239
''And l don't see you leaving
with any of this alleged grief you're sharing.

693
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,708
''ln fact, the only thing you do take out
of here are my cinnamon buns.' '

694
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:14,912
-So l never saw her again, obviously.
-Oh, my God, l can't believe you said that.

695
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,717
l feel guilty now.

696
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,980
-You do not.
-l do.

697
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:23,154
You're right. l.. . l don't miss her at all.

698
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:46,113
Okay, moving right along.
That takes care of Taz.

699
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,986
The old apple pie trick, eh?

700
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:57,185
For the open house.
Warm baked goods make it feel homier.

701
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,357
No, l'm just.. . l'm just making a pie.

702
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,765
l thought you were doing it
for the open house.

703
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:12,068
-So.. . Now. Now, you're not going to stay?
-God, no. No, no. You shouldn't either.

704
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:14,843
You shouldn't.

705
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,345
Come on.
Becca, l'm not going to bother anyone.

706
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:22,578
So we have the garbage cans in the back,
the sign out front, l mowed the lawn.

707
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:26,246
l thought we'd set the sign-in sheet here.
We can move through the living room.

708
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,750
That's fine.

709
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:31,122
Now, my wife's gonna hide out,
but l'll stick around, if that's okay with you.

710
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,422
Sure. However you want to do it.

711
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,199
-Okay. Perfect.
-Okay.

712
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,858
-Bye, babe.
-Bye.

713
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,871
Think that's everything.

714
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:10,633
<i>l know, it's just gorgeous...</i>

715
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,668
Southern-western exposures. Sun all day.

716
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,501
-Why don't we take a look upstairs?
-That's a great idea. l'll show you.

717
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,631
-Good. Cool.
-Follow me.

718
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,868
-Come on, honey.
-lt's on 3<i>l</i>4 of an acre,

719
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,208
which is the largest lot in the neighborhood.

720
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,645
We can start with the master bedroom
if you want to see that.

721
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,512
Wait. What's in here?

722
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,246
Well.. . This is.. . This is.. .

723
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,689
This would be a good room
for the little guy, obviously.

724
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,762
How about that, buddy? You like this room?

725
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:43,395
-Careful with that.
-Sweetheart. That's not our stuff.

726
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:46,161
-Thank you.
-So, how old's your son?

727
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,466
This is your son's room, l assume?

728
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,703
lt.. . lt was. lt was his room.

729
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:58,406
But he died, my son. He died.
There was a car right out front.

730
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,577
-Oh, my God.
-l'm.. .

731
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:06,251
-l'm so sorry.
-Thank you.

732
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,881
This must be so difficult for you.

733
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:13,189
lt's.. . lt's pretty weird.

734
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,099
lt's funny because l still.. .
l forget that he's not here sometimes.

735
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,137
Like maybe he's just hiding under the bed,
he's gonna pop out like he used to do.

736
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,836
But.. .

737
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,401
l still feel him here.

738
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,682
-Would you like to see the master bedroom?
-Yeah. Okay, come on.

739
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,713
Yeah. Sure, l'll be there.

740
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,927
-Who's that?
-Becca. She wants to hang out.

741
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,635
-This was a good idea.
-lt's nice, right?

742
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,936
God, you're starting to show so early.

743
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,667
l know. l feel like a big old balloon.

744
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,267
l swear, once this kid is born,
l'm going right to the gym.

745
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,439
While Mom watches the baby.

746
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,118
What does that mean,
''While Mom watches the baby''?

747
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:12,517
While you're at the gym,
Mom can watch the baby. She loves that.

748
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,251
Auggie could watch the baby.
He works at night, so he'll be home.

749
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,690
Okay. Auggie then.

750
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,594
l resent the feeling that l get from you
that l don't deserve this baby.

751
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,165
Or that l'm not mature enough
or smart enough to take care of it.

752
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:27,668
l mean, my God, if Mom could do it,
how hard could it be?

753
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:39,208
-This all right?
-Yeah. lt's fine.

754
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,580
l've just got to pick up a few things
and then we can do lunch.

755
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:45,848
-Okay. Yeah.
-They're made of strawberries.

756
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:49,250
Mommy, please,
can l have some Fruit Roll-Ups?

757
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,486
-No, Sammy. You know the answer.
-Please?

758
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,798
-Can l have some, please?
-Sammy, no.

759
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,991
l want the Fruit Roll-Ups.

760
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,660
-Not happening.
-Please, l'll be good.

761
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,135
-Stop it.
-Please.

762
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,001
-No. You're not gonna get them.
-l promise.

763
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:07,974
You know what? lt's only three bucks.
Why don't you give him the Roll-Ups?

764
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,738
Not that it's any of your business,

765
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,942
but we don't allow candy in our house,
and my son knows that.

766
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,542
Come on, it's just fruit.
Why don't you give him the treat?

767
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:18,854
Are you a mom?

768
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,920
Yeah, l didn't think so. Excuse me.

769
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,720
Go to the car. Becca, go to the car.

770
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:30,423
Sammy, it's okay.

771
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,833
She just lost her son eight months ago,
and she's not feeling really very well.

772
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,370
-l'm so sorry.. .
-l don't care.

773
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,240
Mommy's okay.

774
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,382
-Hey-hey.
-Hey.

775
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,849
Fun day out?

776
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:59,016
-How'd it go here?
-Not so good. Not so good.

777
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,695
l think we need to clean out that room.

778
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,169
Okay.

779
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,637
Maybe make it into a guest room
or something.

780
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,469
Don't get any ideas.

781
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,406
Jesus.

782
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,642
Hello.

783
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:27,010
The door was wide open, so.. .

784
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:31,084
-And l knocked, but.. .
-Taz, shut up!

785
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,892
l saw the sign out front,
so l thought it'd be okay to.. .

786
01:05:34,997 --> 01:05:36,828
-Looking to buy a house?
-Howie.

787
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,922
No.

788
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,694
No, l just came to give you this.

789
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:46,002
l said l'd let you read it
when it was done, so.. .

790
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,837
What is this?

791
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,248
Thank you.

792
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:59,318
We bumped into each other in the.. .
ln the library.

793
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,791
And.. . And we decided to meet.

794
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,820
You decided to meet?

795
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,262
Yeah. Couple of times.

796
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,357
Okay.

797
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,937
-Sorry. l didn't realize that you.. .
-lt's.. .

798
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:19,671
-Did you meet here?
-No. No. We met in the park.

799
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,938
You met in the park.

800
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:27,573
Yeah.

801
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,748
So, my wife

802
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,380
agrees to meet you in a public place,
and you.. .

803
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,349
And you what? You apologize?

804
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,922
-l guess.
-You guess? Okay.

805
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:46,657
-Okay. Okay. You apologize and.. .
-Come on, Howie, that's enough now.

806
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,031
-And then what?
-That's enough.

807
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,230
-Look at me.
-Howie. That is enough.

808
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,705
-What is that?
-lt's a comic book.

809
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:56,972
lt's a comic book? A comic book.
Did she tell you to bring it here?

810
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,204
-No, she didn't.
-No, she didn't,

811
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,442
because this is our house!

812
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,042
And just because there's a sign out front
doesn't mean that you can pop in!

813
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:08,590
-Howie, all right. All right.
-And you just don't.. . No, it's not all right!

814
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,989
You just don't walk into somebody's home
like that!

815
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:15,056
-You should show a little fucking respect!
-l gotta go.

816
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,861
You're an asshole.

817
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:22,169
Wait! Wait, Jason! Wait a minute. l'm sorry!

818
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,395
l'm an asshole.

819
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,981
Taz, stop it.

820
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,658
Taz! Taz!

821
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,437
Taz, stop it!

822
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,432
Buddy.

823
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,138
Why didn't you tell me?

824
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:45,976
Same reason you don't tell me
why you come home reeking of pot.

825
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,058
Does it ever go away?

826
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,300
No.

827
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:39,334
l don't think it does. Not for me, it hasn't.
lt's going on 1 1 years.

828
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,674
lt changes, though.

829
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,246
How?

830
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,885
l don't know.

831
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:59,725
The weight of it, l guess.
At some point, it becomes bearable.

832
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:04,822
lt turns into something
that you can crawl out from under

833
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,903
and carry around like a brick in your pocket.

834
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:14,474
And you even forget it for a while,
but then you reach in for whatever reason,

835
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,903
and there it is.

836
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,349
''Right. That.' '

837
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,576
Which can be awful.

838
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,584
But not all the time.

839
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,114
lt's kind of.. .

840
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:37,496
Not that you like it, exactly,
but it's what you've got instead of your son.

841
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,831
So, you carry it around.

842
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,709
And it doesn't go away.

843
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,979
Which is.. .

844
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,452
Which is what?

845
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:05,351
Fine. Actually.

846
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,421
Hello?

847
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,022
Hi.

848
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,667
Hi, it's Howie.

849
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,736
Howie Corbett from group.

850
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,175
Hi, Howie.

851
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,147
There you go, boy.

852
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,121
-Hey.
-Hi.

853
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,421
You going to group?

854
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,326
-Yeah. You didn't want to go, did you?
-No.

855
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,004
<i>...the president, essentially, will get up.</i>

856
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,333
<i>What do you think?</i>

857
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,480
<i>Hi, it's Jason. Please leave a message.</i>

858
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,014
You find the house okay?

859
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,421
Howie?

860
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,572
l'm sorry.

861
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,893
Becca?

862
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,333
Becca?

863
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:57,971
Becca?

864
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:03,477
Becca?

865
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,286
God!

866
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,658
Sorry.

867
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:29,967
-What time is it?
-Almost 6:00.

868
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,969
And you're just getting home?

869
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,122
-So, how was it?
-lt was okay.

870
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,761
-Well, you look nice.
-Thank you.

871
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,828
ls she your girlfriend?

872
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,163
No, she's just a friend.

873
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,672
-She's pretty.
-Yeah.

874
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,043
She is pretty.

875
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,877
l liked this so much.

876
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:20,385
-lt's.. . Well, it's beautiful.
-Thank you. Thanks.

877
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:25,386
lt reminded me of Eurydice and Orpheus.
Do you know that myth?

878
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,121
No.

879
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:30,956
Eurydice dies,
and Orpheus misses her so much

880
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:36,766
that he travels to Hades to retrieve her and.. .
Well, in the end, it doesn't work out.

881
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,366
l should read it.

882
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,576
So, is the scientist your dad?

883
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,914
-The scientist that the boy's looking for?
-No.

884
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:53,220
-ls it based on him?
-No, my dad was an English teacher.

885
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,823
l was curious about that.

886
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,425
lt's just a story.

887
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,189
-l know. l was just.. .
-Reading into it.

888
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:09,868
-Do you think they're real?
-Parallel universes?

889
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,137
l think it's basic science.

890
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,404
You know, if space is infinite,

891
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,505
then everything's possible.

892
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:25,720
So, somewhere out there, l'm what?
l'm making pancakes?

893
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:29,587
-Or l'm at a water park?
-Sure. Yeah.

894
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:33,092
-Yeah?
-Yeah, both. You know, whatever.

895
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,925
l think, you know,
it's the laws of probability.

896
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:40,627
There are tons of you's out there,
and there's tons of me's floating around.

897
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,262
Yeah. And this is just the sad version of us.

898
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:47,968
Yeah, l guess.

899
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:51,876
But there's other versions,
and in these other versions,

900
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,643
-everything goes our way.
-Assuming you believe in science.

901
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,249
l like that thought. lt's nice.

902
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,525
Somewhere out there
l'm having a good time.

903
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:18,961
l thought you'd left.

904
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,965
No, l didn't leave.

905
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:34,943
l was thinking we could invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.

906
01:22:39,554 --> 01:22:43,320
Well, she's never gonna call me.
She thinks l hate her, so.. .

907
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,251
l'll let her off the hook.

908
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:53,798
-A cookout?
-Be good to see the kids.

909
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,393
Have to.. .
Have to get something for Emily, though.

910
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:59,598
lt was her birthday.
She turned four last week.

911
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,834
Right.

912
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,435
Okay.

913
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,683
-Danny's is coming up.
-l know.

914
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:17,186
-lt's gonna be a tough one.
-Yeah.

915
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:22,996
So, that kid,

916
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,358
Jason,

917
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:31,232
-did you tell him we didn't blame him?
-We don't blame him.

918
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,900
No, l know, but did you let him know that?

919
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,336
Yeah, l guess so.

920
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,644
That's good.

921
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:43,010
-You could talk to him if you want.
-l don't want to.

922
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,176
Okay.

923
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,925
lt's so quiet.

924
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:56,061
Well, that's 'cause l slipped Taz
a couple of Ambien.

925
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,723
-Funny.
-You think l'm joking?

926
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,376
So, what're we gonna do?

927
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,146
About what?

928
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,412
l don't know.

929
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,250
l don't know. Just pick something.

930
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,551
Well,

931
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:34,992
we could go to Village Toys.
Pick up <i>Candy Land</i> for Emily.

932
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:38,939
lt's probably something she'd like.

933
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:43,135
<i>Candy Land</i>. Yeah.

934
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:49,816
And then what?

935
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:53,847
Then we wrap it.

936
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,018
<i>And then</i>

937
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:04,693
<i>we have the cookout.</i>

938
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,629
<i>And they'll come over.</i>

939
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:12,700
-Hi.
-Hi.

940
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:20,538
<i>And we'll have a couple other people over,</i>
<i>so it's not too awkward for anyone.</i>

941
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:22,809
Hi! Oh, my gosh. Look at you!

942
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:26,683
<i>And then, to make them feel comfortable,</i>

943
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:32,055
<i>we'll ask a bunch of questions</i>
<i>about what the kids have been up to,</i>

944
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,393
<i>and we'll pretend we're really interested.</i>

945
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,629
<i>And then...</i>

946
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:44,529
<i>And then we'll wait for someone</i>
<i>to bring up Danny</i>

947
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,839
<i>while the kids are playing,</i>

948
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:53,071
<i>and maybe that will go on for a little while.</i>

949
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,705
<i>And after that,</i>

950
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:59,043
<i>they'll go home.</i>

951
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,024
<i>And then what?</i>

952
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,129
<i>l don't know.</i>

953
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,963
<i>Something, though.</i>
