1
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:38,257
Dad, Mom, how are you?

2
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,840
The stars are shining down on your son!

3
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,757
Take care of yourself.

4
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:50,507
As an undergraduate in Beijing,
I studied the famous Reiser model.

5
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:56,424
Don't forget to write, ok?

6
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,382
Now I have the honor
to work for the great man himself.

7
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:05,132
Under his supervision,
I will make important discoveries,

8
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:08,757
and bring honor to our family.

9
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,840
Liu Xing?
- Here!

10
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,590
Oh, come in.

11
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:41,840
Liu Xing? Am I saying that right?
- Yes.

12
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,174
This is the highest score we've ever had
on the qualifying exam, you know that?

13
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,757
Yes.

14
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:51,299
It's a great pleasure to meet you,
Professor Reiser.

15
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:53,965
We don't go for all that formality here.
Just call me Jake.

16
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,757
Sit down.
- Thank you. Thank you.

17
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:03,215
Have you read my cosmic string theory?
- I read about it in Beijing. Very good.

18
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,132
Uh huh. Good, good.

19
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,632
So, sit down, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.
- Thank you.

20
00:03:07,758 --> 00:03:11,090
What we're doing here is we're creating
a model, a computer model

21
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:13,090
of the early universe based on my theory.

22
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:16,257
Have you done any
computer model work in Beijing?

23
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:22,465
Uh, yes, but very basic,
because computer there is very slow.

24
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,590
Hmm. Well, ours here are very fast.
State-of-the-art as a matter of fact.

25
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:26,840
Until next week.

26
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah, I think so.

27
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:33,090
So how would you like to join our team?

28
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,132
It would be my great honor.
- Okay. All right.

29
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:41,965
Listen, my assistant Hildy will get you
set up with all the redshift data

30
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,632
and everything you need with the
computers. And welcome to the team.

31
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,132
My door is always open.
- Thank you, Professor Reiser.

32
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,590
Just call me Jake.
- Thank you, Professor Jake.

33
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,465
Okay.
Could you close the door on your way out?

34
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,757
Yes, thank you.
- Okay. Welcome to the team.

35
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:57,965
Thank you.
- Okay.

36
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,882
Ah. Good meeting? Yeah?
- Yeah.

37
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:06,049
Redshift data. Reiser Model.
- Thank you.

38
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,090
Okay. Codes.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,049
You know where the lab is?
- Yes. Thank you.

40
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,340
Down the hall, to the left.
Okay, bye.

41
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,757
EARTH

42
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:10,215
Are you new?
- Hello.

43
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,507
Have you eaten?
- Yes. Hello.

44
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:49,840
Take the cable.
- Put it back.

45
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,340
Why?
- Don't you get it? It's private property!

46
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:56,007
How can airwaves be private?

47
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,799
You can ask the cops on your way to jail.

48
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:04,299
They love arguing these technicalities.

49
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,757
Bullshit.

50
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,715
I’m coming. Oh, yeah!
Keep turning it, just like that.

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,215
Picture, picture, Old Wu!

52
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,215
Yes. Oh, I'm coming.
Oh, yeah!

53
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,090
Oh my God, I’m gonna come!

54
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,299
Can't we just get a new TV?

55
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:28,049
You're gonna make me come!

56
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,507
I'm coming!
Oh, yeah! Oh, God!

57
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:35,132
I’m cumming. I'm cumming. I’m cumming.

58
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:40,174
Why are they always saying "I’m coming"?
Where are they going?

59
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,632
You don't know?

60
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:48,590
It means "rain clouds gathering
about to burst".

61
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,215
I'm coming.

62
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:53,632
Welcome to Bible Study.

63
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,132
I am Reverend Hollings.

64
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:00,090
And today, we have food
provided by the Auxiliary,

65
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:04,174
which I thought
we would have afterwards, but...

66
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,924
Or we can do it this way.

67
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:13,090
I see we have three new students here.
Welcome.

68
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:16,257
Let's do our study. Yes?
Behold...

69
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,174
I hear the church does a lot
to help foreign students.

70
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:27,465
We can get a free ride to the supermarket
and buy some cheap stuff.

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,757
They also give away furniture.

72
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,257
The King said to the servants...

73
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh, here you are.
- Hey. Hello, Mrs. Silver.

74
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,215
Oh my God,
am I interrupting a little prayer?

75
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,632
No, I think I made it... I'm late.

76
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:45,424
Okay. I thought I was early.
- Uh, no, it's, it's just, it's just fine.

77
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,549
Let me introduce you.

78
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,507
For those of you who haven't met
this lovely lady, this is Joanna Silver,

79
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:55,215
a great patron of Chinese culture
at the university.

80
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,590
And one of the most caring
members of our community.

81
00:07:57,716 --> 00:08:01,340
Very elaborate introduction
for somebody who's just a driver.

82
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,382
I'm here for the field trip.
Does anybody want to go?

83
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:07,549
Yes, the field trip.
- We should probably take off fairly soon.

84
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:09,424
Oh, look at how many there are.
- Yes.

85
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,257
Here he is.
I thought you might have forgotten us.

86
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,299
No, no, no, no.
My meeting went late. I’m sorry.

87
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:18,132
Okay. Anyways.
So some of you can get in here.

88
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:21,924
And we’ll go...
Get in there, three, three in there.

89
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:25,465
Where are we going?
- Pioneer Village. You’ll love it.

90
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:27,882
Thank you for doing this. Yes?

91
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,299
What's the name of the car?
- Oh, it's a Jaguar.

92
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:35,174
Jaguar.
- Yes, we should probably all get in.

93
00:08:35,258 --> 00:08:36,757
Uh, could I sit here?

94
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:41,382
Yes, you could sit there,
but let me just open the... Oh!

95
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,882
Thank you.
- Thank you.

96
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,590
Pile in, fellows. Okay. Very good.

97
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:48,174
How many miles per gallon?
- Miles per gallon?

98
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:51,382
Who would ask me that?
I have no idea. Sorry.

99
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,840
So, you’ll follow me. Right?
- Okay. Bye bye.

100
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,549
Oh, God.

101
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:03,174
Cool sound system! What's the music?
- it’s Bach. Do you like it?

102
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,299
I like it.
- Bach?

103
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:08,174
I know him.
Bach's harmonies are very mathematical.

104
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,424
Yes, but at times very moving too,
I think.

105
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:15,882
To me, mathematics can be very moving.
I am scientist.

106
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:20,840
You certainly are.
All right, seatbelts.

107
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:21,965
Go!

108
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:27,924
Did the cowboys live here?
- Cowboys lived here?

109
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,090
Oh, no. Actually, no.

110
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:34,632
This is all a reproduction. it’s a fake.

111
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,465
There should be a cowboy.

112
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,090
Yeah, it would be more fun
if there were cowboys.

113
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:45,174
But, you see, the first people
who settled here were homesteaders.

114
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:49,882
They were farmers, and they had sheep
and they had cattle and...

115
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:53,465
No, they didn't have cattle.
They had crops and I don't know what else.

116
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:56,840
In the shop there are souvenirs.

117
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:01,715
There are cowboy things
like guns and things.

118
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:02,840
I wonder who
the fastest gun in the East is.

119
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:06,007
I guess we’ll never know.

120
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:19,465
Hmm.

121
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:23,632
Professor Reiser.
- Call me Jake.

122
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:27,924
Now, we're cookin' with gas.
- Thank you.

123
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:31,549
Listen. Do you think you could get
to the next stage by tomorrow?

124
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,965
'Cause I have a journal deadline.

125
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,924
Of course. No problem.
- No problem?

126
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:37,715
No problem.
- Great.

127
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,424
Thank you, Professor Reiser.

128
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,340
How do you say I love Beijing in Chinese?

129
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:46,590
I love Beijing students.

130
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:49,090
Thank you, Professor Reiser.
- Thank you.

131
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:54,924
Let's get out of here.
- Yeah. I’m late for my night job.

132
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:48,465
Why is he sleeping here?
- No idea. Let's wake him up.

133
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,924
Comrades!
Good morning.

134
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:55,757
We must strengthen our body
to protect our country!

135
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,757
The People's exercise starts now!

136
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:14,424
What time is it?
- it’s past 8:00.

137
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,090
Liu Xing. Morning.
- Hi. Morning.

138
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:26,215
What are you doing so early?
You look exhausted.

139
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,840
I have this most urgently
for Professor Reiser.

140
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,840
Oh, well, no, you don't
need to see him now.

141
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:37,924
You should be home in bed.
- He need it for article deadline.

142
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:40,882
That doesn't need to be in
till Thursday afternoon.

143
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:46,007
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I’m positive. I'm sure.

144
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:49,007
Oh.
- Yeah. You have time.

145
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:50,257
Okay.

146
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:51,882
Do you want to wait for him?
- Yes.

147
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,632
Okay. He should be here very soon.
All right? - Okay.

148
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,924
Professor Reiser!

149
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,049
Hi.

150
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,924
I have finished.
- You're done?

151
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:13,757
Yes.
- So early?

152
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:15,049
Yes.

153
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:23,590
You see, in second run I adjust the
parameter of Omega for a better result.

154
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:28,590
This is excellent work, Liu Xing.
- Thank you.

155
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm giving a talk at the Early Universe
Symposium a little later this summer.

156
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:36,549
Would you like to join me?
- Thank you very much.

157
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:37,757
Yeah?
- Yes.

158
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:41,632
Great food, free booze and beautiful,
albeit high-strung women.

159
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,757
Strong.
- Strung.

160
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,632
Hot chicks. Okay?
- Hot chicks?

161
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,465
Thank you, Professor Reiser.
- Jake. Call me Jake.

162
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,590
Thank you.
- Jake.

163
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:55,299
Dad, Mom , how are you?

164
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:02,424
I've been very lucky recently.

165
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:06,799
I am the number one assistant
to Professor Reiser.

166
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:11,049
Also, I met a nice Lady named Joanna
who loves Chinese culture.

167
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:15,590
There's plenty of food here.
Please don't send any more.

168
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,590
I read in the papers

169
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:25,007
American kids watch
over 30 hours of TV every week.

170
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,257
And at 1 3 they're already doing "it".

171
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:35,257
Where do they find time?
- Those Americans are efficient.

172
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:41,215
Maybe they do homework
while watching TV and doing "it" too.

173
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,757
Our Liu Xing knows nothing but studying.

174
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:46,715
That boy's been putting in
a lot of all-nighters.

175
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,757
Come on, these kids are grateful
for whatever work I give them.

176
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:53,549
They come from a place where
astrology is considered a science,

177
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:55,465
and indoor plumbing a luxury.

178
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,007
Yeah, they've only got
2000 years of civilization on us.

179
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,965
I imagine they think
we are the barbarians.

180
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,465
Your mail.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,007
Besides, what do you know about it?
You've never even been to China.

182
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,132
I'm a theorist.
I don't have to actually go there.

183
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,257
I don't even like Chinese food.

184
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,382
METAL

185
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,257
Get dressed right away.

186
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,007
I have to leave in 1 5 minutes
and you're taking tickets with Sarah.

187
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,090
No.
- Oh, Hal.

188
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,132
I just... I’ll be glad
to pay for more ticket takers.

189
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,715
Oh, no, it's not about writing a check.
It's very important that you be there.

190
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,965
You're a patron of the arts.
Everybody's expecting you and

191
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,215
it’s not how I want to spend
my Saturday night.

192
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:15,465
Taking tickets and being
a big patron of the arts.

193
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,590
I have the Monkey King coming
all the way from Salt Lake City.

194
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,715
I’ve seen Monkey Kings
from Beijing and Shanghai, so...

195
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,715
I just want to make a connection
with these new Chinese students.

196
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,215
Well, I just don't understand the need
you have to make a connection.

197
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:37,757
I'm kind of tired of connecting.
I’m kind of connected out.

198
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,382
Okay.

199
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:38,090
I would like to propose a toast
to our wonderful performers.

200
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:39,299
Thank you, thank you.

201
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:44,174
And to our new Chinese students,
who have made their own journey west.

202
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,799
We'd like to welcome you to our country.

203
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:49,465
Cheers.
- Thank you.

204
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,632
Liu Xing, you should make a toast.
- Start with "On behalf".

205
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,590
On behalf of Chinese students,

206
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:09,299
so lucky to come to America,
the beautiful country.

207
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:13,757
May we all find our dream here.
- Hear, hear.

208
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:18,465
Therefore. Therefore.
- And therefore...

209
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,132
Therefore, we make this toast
to our new American friends.

210
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,882
Cheers. Up the bottoms.

211
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:31,507
Bottoms up. Yes, yes.

212
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,382
What's so funny?

213
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:46,090
You working tonight?

214
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:50,049
Yeah, this is my dinner.

215
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:54,424
Stuff yourself then.
- That's what I’m doing.

216
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,549
Looking at the stars?

217
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,382
I'm looking at the Dark Matter.

218
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:16,965
Oh, you mean space.

219
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,340
it isn't all space.

220
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,215
There is stuff we can't see,
even with the most powerful telescope.

221
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,924
But we know it is there.
Because of gravitational effect.

222
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,007
Picture the universe as a mountain range.
Only the highest peaks get snow.

223
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:45,590
These snowy peaks are stars and the
galaxies we can see through our telescope.

224
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:49,340
But these are just
the tiniest part of the universe.

225
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:55,132
Maybe one percent.
The rest of the mountain is Dark Matter.

226
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:59,340
99 percent of the universe, Dark Matter.

227
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:06,090
But no one pays attention to it,
because they can't see it.

228
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,465
I can see it with mathematics.

229
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:17,132
I can use mathematics
to see the whole dark mountain.

230
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:25,465
Academics make $50,000 a year, tops.

231
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,507
Private industry pays twice that.

232
00:21:28,591 --> 00:21:31,632
Plus you get royalties, too.

233
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:38,757
Go get the ball. Put it back quick.
- Who won?

234
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,257
What industry?

235
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:45,757
Pharmaceuticals.
I’m going to find a cure for AI DS.

236
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,840
Why are you always winning?
- What about you?

237
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:55,299
I’ll definitely be a millionaire.

238
00:21:56,216 --> 00:22:01,507
I’m going to solve the Dark Matter
Problem, win the Nobel Prize,

239
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:04,715
and marry a blond,
blue-eyed American girl.

240
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,257
Dark Matter again.
You have a one track mind.

241
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,424
Now what can I do for you?

242
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:24,465
I want a cup of tea.

243
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,715
Any particular kind?

244
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,549
Which one is the best?

245
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:33,590
Gosh, I don't know.
I’m more of a coffee drinker myself, but

246
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:37,049
We have lots to choose from.

247
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:42,299
Okay, I would like a togo.

248
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:46,340
Togo?
- Togo. There?

249
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,590
Oh! To go.
- To go, to go.

250
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:52,007
Sure, no problem.

251
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,840
Here.
- Thank you.

252
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,882
You're welcome.

253
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,965
Oh, sorry.
- it’s okay.

254
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,007
Sorry, sorry.

255
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,465
Are you a student here?

256
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,590
Me?
- Yes.

257
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:30,215
No. Not anymore.
Are you?

258
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:32,590
Yes. Cosmology.

259
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,840
Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

260
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:39,215
Wow. Hey, maybe you could
give me a free makeover.

261
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:44,424
I think so.

262
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,840
Well, it goes something like this.

263
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:49,965
A theorist and an experimentalist
were on death row.

264
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,840
He's going to tell a joke.
- Where they belong.

265
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:55,007
Right.
- Most of them.

266
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:58,257
And the guard asked them
for their last wish.

267
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:01,590
So the theorist says,
I'd like to give a seminar,

268
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:05,965
to present my latest theoretical
breakthrough. - Before they die.

269
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,590
And then the guard asks
the experimentalist, who says,

270
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,132
I’d like to be executed
before the seminar.

271
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:16,965
He got it.

272
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,257
All right, everybody,
we have to all thank Joanna

273
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:23,590
for how well she's taken care of
all of our Chinese students.

274
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,590
And I’ve heard about the high cultural
experiences of the Pioneer Village,

275
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:32,882
the Cineplex... High culture.

276
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:37,174
Oh, everyone had fun, didn't you?
- Oh, a great time.

277
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:42,174
I think it's important for everyone
to get out of that lab we gave you.

278
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,507
Ah ha. Yeah, yes.

279
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:47,757
Which we are very grateful
to you and Hal for.

280
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:51,340
And I think we are incubating some
truly remarkable scientists here.

281
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,132
Liu Xing?
- Yes?

282
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:56,465
We let you out sometimes, don't we?
- Yes.

283
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,799
And Professor Reiser is very inspire me.

284
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:02,632
He's a diplomat, too.

285
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:08,132
To me. Inspiring to me.
- Inspiring to me.

286
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:11,965
And Dark Matter is also
still very inspiring to you.

287
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,257
What do you know about Dark Matter?
I thought science didn't interest you.

288
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,965
Well, no. I mean, I am
more interested in the cultural side,

289
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,257
but Liu Xing explained it to me
very eloquently the other day.

290
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,757
And it made sense.

291
00:26:27,341 --> 00:26:29,632
Maybe I should hire him
to do my fundraising.

292
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,924
Speaking of Dark Matter, look at that.

293
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,257
But it is very interesting, Dark Matter.
- Yes.

294
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:45,132
Motions of stars and the galaxies,
all determined by Dark Matter around it.

295
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:49,590
Like a dark...
Like a dark hollow.

296
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:50,924
Hollow?
- Hollow.

297
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,132
Halo, like an angel.

298
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,965
Hon, maybe we should get
some after-dinner drinks for everybody.

299
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,465
Liu Xing?

300
00:26:59,758 --> 00:27:03,340
They're going to go smoke. You smoke?
- I don't.

301
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:08,715
She's probably gonna kill me for this.
I’ll survive.

302
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,257
Professor Reiser,
are you afraid of your wife?

303
00:27:16,716 --> 00:27:21,382
Uh, no.
Just about the cigar smell.

304
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:24,215
Drinking a problem?
- No.

305
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:33,549
Who's that?

306
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:37,840
Oh. That's my advisor, Dr. Gazda.

307
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:42,257
Your advisor?
- Yeah, I was about your age then.

308
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:47,007
After I graduated I published a critique
of his Black Hole Accretion Flows Theory.

309
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,757
I read this paper. Very good.

310
00:27:49,841 --> 00:27:51,090
You did?
- Yeah.

311
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,924
Well, he didn't seem to think so.
But that's how it goes.

312
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,299
in China, this would never happen.
- What?

313
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:02,882
Student never challenge the teacher.

314
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:07,132
Have too much respect.

315
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:11,590
It's a big problem,
Because no challenge, no progress.

316
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:14,215
Well, you feel free
to challenge me all you want.

317
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:20,215
Just remember, I’m always right.
- I think so.

318
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,299
Oh, drink that slowly.
It’ll go straight to your head.

319
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:26,257
Drink it slow.
- Slow.

320
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,424
I love that song.

321
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,757
You know this?
- Yes. It's my favorite song.

322
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,382
I love that song.
- Your favorite?

323
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:27,174
I don't know what it means.

324
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,382
Something about the

325
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:38,632
Blue sky and white cloud...

326
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:44,549
No problem.
- Flowed by...

327
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:52,632
Beneath the white cloud

328
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:56,090
A sheep as white as snow.

329
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,549
Under the white...

330
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:10,799
Under the white sheep...
- No, not under the white sheep.

331
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:21,507
Cosmic strings continues to be
the most elegant explanation

332
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:24,924
of how the galaxies have emerged
from the beginning of time.

333
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,132
And with my revised model,
we will be able to reproduce

334
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:36,840
any and all of the observed large-scale
structures of the entire universe.

335
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:44,174
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

336
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:48,549
Obviously we're not there yet, but...
Yes, my old professor, Dr. Gazda?

337
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:52,715
Yes, I am going to invoke
the privilege of an old teacher

338
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,507
and chastise my former pupil.

339
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,340
Why am I not surprised?
- Some things never change, Jake.

340
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,590
Once again,
you're in denial about the data.

341
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:07,590
Have you seen the latest
redshift images from the CSA?

342
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:11,049
Yes, as a matter of fact I have.
Would you like to share it with everyone?

343
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,382
By all means.
- Go ahead.

344
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:17,882
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a model.
This is reality.

345
00:31:20,216 --> 00:31:24,132
Now, where are these voids
in your model, Jake?

346
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,340
Um, what are these? Daisy chains?

347
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,590
It's insignificant.
- What?

348
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:35,007
That's the trouble with you theorists.

349
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,924
You get so caught up
in your computer models

350
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,965
that you forget to open your eyes
and look up and see the truth.

351
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,715
It's staring you in the face.

352
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,465
You're reminding me of the old joke about
the theorist and the experimentalist.

353
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,965
These two transparencies are a work
in progress, but you are forcing my hand.

354
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,215
Let me show you something here,
that I think may give even you pause.

355
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:04,257
You can see how even a slight
temperature change in the Dark Matter

356
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:10,840
could and probably would
cause these voids, over time.

357
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:16,132
Yeah, it's a Band-Aid.
- Ha!

358
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:18,340
But an elegant one. Yes?

359
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,757
I said in 1 933
Observe the Coma cluster

360
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,340
The redshifts of the galaxies
imply some big velocities

361
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,924
They're moving so fast
They must be missing mass

362
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,757
Dark Matter - do we need it?
What is it? Where is it?

363
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:36,132
Thank you. it’s very nice.

364
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:39,799
Oh, maybe he wants some.
Barry?

365
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,465
Good to see you.

366
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,924
Come on. Now, Liu Xing,
take a look at this woman.

367
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:50,715
Now, this is America.
Try this. Try this drink. Put that away.

368
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,799
Try that, drink it slowly.
Take a look.

369
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:12,382
Liu Xing, I've been looking
all over for you.

370
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:15,965
That was you who saved Jake's derriere
this morning, wasn't it?

371
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,465
I thought you did some marvelous work.

372
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,299
We both come from cultures that propose
a universe with no beginning and no end.

373
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:27,549
Yet here we are, discussing the Big Bang,
the ultimate beginning.

374
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:34,257
But maybe there have been
many beginnings, many big bangs.

375
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:39,049
You know, Liu Xing, I really think you
should focus on this Dark Matter problem.

376
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:42,215
I think you could do some serious damage.

377
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,757
Lies, lies, lies. Don't believe
a word that this man says.

378
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:49,757
But we're talking about you,
you egomaniac.

379
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,882
I was just telling Liu Xing I think he
should focus on this Dark Matter problem.

380
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,382
He has a real passion for it.

381
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:59,090
He'd better have a real passion for it.
He works for me.

382
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:04,049
You work for me, don't you?
Yes. He works for me.

383
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,090
The search is getting popular
As many realize

384
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:09,215
That the detector of Dark Matter
May well win the Nobel Prize

385
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,132
Dad, Mom , how are you?

386
00:34:16,716 --> 00:34:21,340
Professor Reiser invited me to attend
the Early Universe Symposium.

387
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:27,882
There I learned that Dark Matter
is the future of cosmology.

388
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,840
Here in America, I am free
to follow my dreams.

389
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:35,382
I will definitely win the Nobel Prize.

390
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:46,549
WATER

391
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:06,424
Eat grape not, spit out grape skin.

392
00:35:06,508 --> 00:35:10,924
Not eat grape yet, spit out skin grape.

393
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:15,715
Oh! Grape skin! Spit out grape kin.

394
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,590
Eat grape not, spit out grape skin.

395
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:24,215
Not eat grape yet, spit out grape skin.

396
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,757
Sounds kind of like I never left Shanghai.

397
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:30,465
Oh, hi!
- Ah, hello!

398
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:33,215
How you been?

399
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,924
I missed you.
- I missed you.

400
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,590
Did everything go good?
- Oh, really good.

401
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:42,965
We're this close to two million units.
- Fantastic. What about Mommy?

402
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,215
Oh, it's oolong. it’s my favorite.
I just made some oolong. You want some?

403
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,257
No, no thanks.
- You sure?

404
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:53,257
You want to sit?
- Yeah.

405
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,840
Tell me the news.

406
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:58,715
Lots going on.
Whole new crop of Chinese students.

407
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,340
And one of them, Laurence Feng, used
to be... Liu Xing, you know, my friend?

408
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:08,340
His rival at Beijing University.
Number two at Beijing University.

409
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:10,840
So that's big news.

410
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:15,132
I’m taking the new students out to Pioneer
Village tomorrow. You want to come?

411
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:17,924
No, thank you.

412
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:21,382
Are you gonna dazzle them
with your language skills?

413
00:36:21,466 --> 00:36:23,632
Don't make fun of me.
I’m just...

414
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:29,715
It's kind of cool. The greatest thing
about trying to learn this language

415
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,340
is how it just really forces you to have
another whole perspective on the world,

416
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:42,299
because it's so indirect and subtle
and they don't have any tenses.

417
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:47,257
So, they say, "I am."

418
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:51,590
And "last year I am",
and "in the future I am".

419
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:57,174
You know, be here now, sort of.
- Now I am.

420
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:14,757
Feng Gang.

421
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:17,715
What happened to you?

422
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:24,049
Why did you change your name to Laurence?
What kind of name is that?

423
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:28,215
Yes, my wife thinks it's easier
for Americans to say,

424
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,965
to make them feel more comfortable.

425
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:41,465
Your theory doesn't work.

426
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,465
Galaxies start forming way too late.

427
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,340
You can't explain quasars
at redshift four.

428
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:53,715
I know. We can fix that.

429
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,965
You get much better results
with warm Dark Matter,

430
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,965
and inflation instead of cosmic strings.

431
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,132
That's not the Reiser Model.

432
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:14,632
We should have our
own ideas and language.

433
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:24,507
But we're all working for Reiser here.

434
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,257
Why did you come here?
- To meet you.

435
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,965
No, I mean, to America.
- Oh, America.

436
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,049
To meet you.
- Seriously.

437
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:48,132
Seriously, seriously.
I have so much "seriously" all day.

438
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:54,840
Wait. I will show you the galaxy.

439
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:57,382
In your cup.

440
00:40:00,216 --> 00:40:03,674
Watch closely.

441
00:40:22,216 --> 00:40:27,007
I figured out that cosmology
has nothing to do with skin care.

442
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,549
You must think I'm an idiot.

443
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,090
Of course ... not.

444
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:35,215
You study the Big Bang.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,215
It's supposed to be
the beginning of the universe.

446
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:41,715
I don't believe it.

447
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,340
Because something had to cause the Big
Bang, it didn't just come from nothing.

448
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:49,049
What do you think caused the Big Bang?
- God.

449
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:53,007
Then what caused the God?
He can't come out of nowhere.

450
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:56,715
He's eternal.
He's always been there.

451
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,215
In my new theory, the universe is eternal.

452
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,424
Big Bang is a major event,
but not beginning.

453
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:08,424
Universe has no beginning,
no end, just like God.

454
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:13,965
So you see, we are really the same.
Universe and God is the same.

455
00:41:20,383 --> 00:41:23,549
For my dissertation,
I intend to develop

456
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:28,340
new non-equilibrium techniques
for the Reiser Model,

457
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:35,882
running from 1 0 to the minus 36 seconds
to one second after the Big Bang.

458
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:37,507
That's what I call a dissertation.

459
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:41,632
impeccable, Laurence.
We look forward to the results.

460
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:42,799
Thank you.

461
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:47,049
Liu Xing, I believe, is next, who is being
very secretive about his proposal.

462
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:49,590
I'm his advisor
and I don't even know what it is.

463
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,715
This kid is quite brilliant.
- This is your boy, huh?

464
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,174
I'm looking forward to being surprised.

465
00:42:07,841 --> 00:42:14,882
At present, the model doesn't explain
large voids seen by observer.

466
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,090
My model?

467
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:26,840
What if the voids are not empty at all,

468
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:29,424
but full of Dark Matter?

469
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:35,340
I will use Superstring Theory
to find a new Dark Matter particle

470
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:38,132
that su- sur- surpre-
- Suppresses?

471
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:41,799
Suppresses galaxy formation.

472
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:48,840
Well, I think I speak for the Chair
and for Professor Small in saying,

473
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:53,799
we're all impressed with
your tremendous creativity,

474
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:58,049
but there is no guarantee that Superstring
Theory will predict such a particle.

475
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,382
You need to change
your dissertation proposal

476
00:43:00,466 --> 00:43:04,632
and pick a problem
that you know has an answer.

477
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:06,215
Okay?

478
00:43:08,758 --> 00:43:12,590
Unless he wants to be a grad student
for the rest of his life.

479
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:37,257
Why don't you try being more practical?

480
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:40,757
Just find something that Reiser
will approve, and graduate first.

481
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:44,132
That doesn't sound like someone
who wants to cure AI DS.

482
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:48,340
My dissertation is on a molecule
invented by my professor ten years ago.

483
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:52,840
What a waste of brain cells.

484
00:44:31,883 --> 00:44:34,924
And today, I welcome all of you here,
as one more child...

485
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:40,340
We have Buddhism, Taoism,
and Confucianism.

486
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:43,340
Why do they need Jesus?

487
00:44:43,466 --> 00:44:48,007
Do you Laurence, and you Cindy, promise
to raise Noelle in the Christian faith,

488
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:52,132
and to be an active member of our church?
- We do.

489
00:44:52,216 --> 00:44:54,549
Then through water and through Spirit,

490
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:58,757
I welcome you to the Christian faith,
to be one of God's own children.

491
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:06,590
In the name of the Father and the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

492
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,090
Liu Xing!
- Yes?

493
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:14,257
We're having a party tonight.
You're welcome to come.

494
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:18,049
Yes. Thank you.
- Say "Uncle Liu Xing".

495
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,590
Feng Gang, congratulations.

496
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:24,174
All those years in school have paid off.

497
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:29,132
You've done well for yourself and
such a pretty wife from Shanghai too.

498
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:30,924
Now I have mouths to feed.

499
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:33,924
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

500
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:35,549
Goodbye.

501
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,007
I think she's faking it for our sake.

502
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,507
Sounds real to me.

503
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,382
She's trying to excite us.

504
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:17,924
A true female orgasm builds slowly.
Very slowly.

505
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,715
A true female orgasm

506
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,924
starts from the bottom of the throat.

507
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,799
it sounds like this.

508
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:09,632
Got it. I've got it. I’ve got it!

509
00:47:09,758 --> 00:47:16,924
I've got it! Major breakthrough! Old Wu!
Old Wu! I have a major breakthrough!

510
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,632
Little Square, Little Square!

511
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:24,132
Sorry. Little Square, Little Square!
- Fuck off, I'm busy!

512
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,799
Come here.

513
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:34,257
Superstring theory predicts
shadow particles

514
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:39,840
that interact with ordinary matter
only through gravity.

515
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:43,507
This is a major breakthrough.
A major breakthrough!

516
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:48,132
Dark Matter solves
the problems of the Reiser Model.

517
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:49,924
Dark Matter.

518
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,632
Tell him that
it's against the Journal's Policy.

519
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:01,257
He'll, he's a bit of a bureaucrat.
He’ll understand that kind of talk.

520
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:04,132
Right, so basically you want me
to do your dirty work for you.

521
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:06,257
Well
- No, it's fine.

522
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,549
Listen, there are two more things.
- Professor Reiser!

523
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:11,757
Listen, don't forget tonight, six o'clock.
At six o'clock is the reception.

524
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:14,590
Call your sister, it's her birthday,
You sent flowers.

525
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:17,424
Call her, please.
- I sent flowers? How nice of me.

526
00:48:17,508 --> 00:48:22,632
Professor Reiser, huge breakthrough.
Huge breakthrough.

527
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:26,132
Huge breakthrough?

528
00:48:32,216 --> 00:48:33,257
Huge breakthrough.

529
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:36,924
Huge breakthrough.
Yes, l, yes, I heard that.

530
00:48:37,008 --> 00:48:40,507
Huge implications for cosmology.

531
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:51,049
You did this?
- Yes.

532
00:48:51,716 --> 00:48:54,924
Can this be my dissertation?

533
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:02,049
What are you, out of your mind?
This is way over your head.

534
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:07,757
Way past your capabilities.
- But I already got a good result.

535
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,340
Liu Xing, let me explain something to you.

536
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:14,299
This is a marathon.
You cannot sprint all the way. All right?

537
00:49:14,383 --> 00:49:17,257
Pick something simpler,
and then build on that.

538
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:21,132
You're going to have to learn that you
have to pay your dues first. Okay?

539
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:29,757
But...
- I said absolutely not. No. Okay?

540
00:49:39,216 --> 00:49:42,299
Dad, Mom , how are you?

541
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:45,132
Great news!

542
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,924
I've had a major breakthrough.

543
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:51,007
Professor Reiser is very pleased.

544
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:56,049
He says this discovery
can be the basis for my Ph. D. thesis.

545
00:49:56,466 --> 00:49:59,215
I will make you proud of me.

546
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:06,174
I hear American children
don't take care of their parents.

547
00:50:06,258 --> 00:50:11,465
They send them to retirement homes
and let them die there.

548
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:19,299
Our son would never do that.

549
00:50:26,508 --> 00:50:28,590
WOOD

550
00:50:57,008 --> 00:51:00,132
After generating much important research,

551
00:51:00,216 --> 00:51:04,590
cosmic strings,
first proposed by Jacob Reiser,

552
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:08,882
no longer explain the observed
structure of the universe.

553
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:10,007
Hildy!

554
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:14,924
By using superstrings, I have discovered
a warm Dark Matter particle.

555
00:51:15,008 --> 00:51:16,465
Did you know this was going to happen?

556
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,132
How could I possiblly know?
I am not a mind reader.

557
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:21,132
You do know.

558
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:25,465
How dare he?

559
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,257
Without my permission.
Without even showing it to me.

560
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,424
I believe he tried.
- He did not.

561
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:36,632
He showed me some scribbles on a yellow
legal pad. Why are you siding with him?

562
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,299
Liu Xing worships you. He wanted
your blessing, you didn't give it to him.

563
00:51:40,383 --> 00:51:42,590
That's all that happened.
- Yeah, he's all so respectful,

564
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:44,757
bowing and obsequious on the outside.

565
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,549
On the inside
he's an arrogant little bastard.

566
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,840
Maybe they all are.

567
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:56,840
Joanna, Reiser think I’m attacking him.
- Oh.

568
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:59,299
I’m not attacking him.
- I know you're not.

569
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:02,299
This can help improve his model.

570
00:52:02,383 --> 00:52:06,215
I was hoping so much
he will publish my article.

571
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,382
I'm sure he will.

572
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:10,590
And even if he doesn't, we can always
send it out to be published someplace.

573
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:13,340
Oh, my God. That's...
- Fabulous.

574
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:17,424
Exactly what I would say.
See, I just wanted something strong.

575
00:52:17,508 --> 00:52:21,340
I can't tell which one of these is his...
- Now, there it is. Sixteen and a half.

576
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:24,590
I love that, too.
I’ll take that.

577
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,174
Oh, sorry.

578
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:31,924
Oh, no, no, no. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

579
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:34,465
I think you should have this one.

580
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:38,507
Too expensive.

581
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:42,715
The lady has impeccable taste.
- Well, it's only money.

582
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,840
When is your dissertation presentation?
- Next week.

583
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:48,965
Next week? And you're going
to wear this terrible shirt?

584
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,132
No, no, no, you wear this one.

585
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:55,882
You walk in, you have confidence,
you look good, you feel good.

586
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:57,340
Hit it out of the park.

587
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,757
I really don't need that shirt.

588
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,715
No, you don't need it,
but we're going to get it.

589
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,007
Dress for success.

590
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,090
You just worry. You're worrying too much.
You really are.

591
00:53:09,175 --> 00:53:11,090
You know what my mother said?

592
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:14,632
Worry is interest paid on trouble
that has not happened yet.

593
00:53:16,258 --> 00:53:17,965
So don't worry.

594
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:24,174
Hey, be careful with my new shirt!

595
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,757
Typical American thinking.

596
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:35,299
To climb a mountain,
you need hiking shoes.

597
00:53:35,383 --> 00:53:40,215
To ride a bike, you need a helmet.

598
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:47,215
You can't just drink tap water.
it has to be mineral water.

599
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:54,632
Even when sleeping,
you have to wear sexy underwear.

600
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:14,715
That shirt isn't so great.

601
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,215
Dress for success.
Haven't you heard of that?

602
00:54:40,216 --> 00:54:41,674
Liu Xing?

603
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:08,424
Therefore, this new warm Dark Matter
make a better match to observation,

604
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:14,090
as you can see
from final frame of simulation.

605
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:29,799
Did you use single- or
double-precision computation?

606
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:32,215
Single.
- But...

607
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,465
But even the slightest
computational error,

608
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,090
like a round-off error,
can significantly alter the results.

609
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:42,340
Results not caused by a round-off error.

610
00:55:42,425 --> 00:55:47,632
So you say, but you have
no way to prove it. Do you?

611
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:55,049
Professor Reiser,
the simulation is accurate.

612
00:55:55,133 --> 00:56:00,965
Double precision is standard procedure,
Liu Xing. Standard.

613
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,715
But, Professor Reiser...

614
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:12,757
Why you never tell this to me?

615
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:18,382
I do one thousand runs for your model,

616
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:20,924
single precision,

617
00:56:21,008 --> 00:56:27,007
and you never tell this to me.
Never tell me, do different.

618
00:56:29,716 --> 00:56:32,424
Excuse us for a moment.

619
00:56:32,508 --> 00:56:36,090
You have to admit,
it's a highly original piece of work.

620
00:56:36,216 --> 00:56:40,674
Do you really want to sign off on a thesis
that may be entirely inaccurate,

621
00:56:40,758 --> 00:56:44,882
simply because some of
the ideas in it are intriguing?

622
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:48,257
Come on, Jake.
He made a very persuasive argument.

623
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:49,840
It's pure speculation.

624
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:54,340
He took the most speculative theory in
physics and speculated a little further.

625
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:57,465
He is in way over his head.

626
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,840
Well, maybe he's way over our heads.

627
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,049
Liu Xing, I'm afraid
we can't accept your dissertation

628
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:08,382
until you redo the computations.

629
00:57:39,425 --> 00:57:42,007
What time is it?

630
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,965
Two o'clock.

631
00:58:09,425 --> 00:58:10,465
Liu Xing!

632
00:58:11,675 --> 00:58:12,715
Liu Xing?

633
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:21,257
Liu Xing, why aren't you answering?

634
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,340
What's going on?

635
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:25,507
I’m coming in.

636
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,049
Let's go. You need a haircut.

637
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,757
You've had enough of that.

638
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:01,965
Come on. Let's go.

639
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:18,090
Liu Xing, come back to China with me.

640
01:00:18,216 --> 01:00:22,382
I’ll get you a job
at the Chinese Science Academy.

641
01:00:23,425 --> 01:00:30,590
With your abilities and degree you qualify
for a nice apartment in central Beijing.

642
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:36,757
Then find a wife who can cook
so you can focus on your research.

643
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,424
Wouldn't that be great?

644
01:00:38,508 --> 01:00:44,590
Get a corporate job like me, and you can
research Dark Matter in your spare time.

645
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:48,799
Even Einstein had a day job.
Fuck dark matter!

646
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:58,715
FIRE

647
01:01:46,425 --> 01:01:48,965
How are you?
- Good.

648
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:51,132
How are you?
- Fine.

649
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:55,757
Thank you.
- Yeah.

650
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:08,507
Happy birthday.

651
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:13,340
Liu Xing, who told you it was my birthday?

652
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:17,424
Oh, you forget, I am a scientist.
I just know.

653
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:20,882
Yeah, well, I see you're
a cosmetologist after all.

654
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:29,007
Then please come to my house after work.
I prepare you a birthday feast.

655
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:36,257
That's so sweet but I already have plans.
- No problem. Tomorrow.

656
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:38,674
I don't think so.

657
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:43,465
I like you, Liu Xing.
You're a really nice guy, but I just...

658
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:47,090
I don't think
it's going to work out between us.

659
01:02:47,216 --> 01:02:51,590
I'm sorry.
- No problem.

660
01:02:57,633 --> 01:03:01,299
Baba, Mama, how are you?

661
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:07,340
I am proud to report that I graduated
with the highest honors.

662
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:10,715
Soon you’ll be living in America with me.

663
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,715
Then you’ll be the proud parents
of Professor Liu Xing.

664
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,132
Now all the universities
are fighting over me.

665
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:22,715
I’m trying to decide
which job offer to accept.

666
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,882
I miss you both very much.

667
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:30,882
Here we go. Hello.
Beer, wine, salad, everything's there.

668
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:36,090
Everybody, Professor Colby.
Professor Colby has the floor.

669
01:03:36,175 --> 01:03:40,840
Thank you, Professor.
I wanted to share some good news with you.

670
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:46,340
For the third year running, the
Gelman Prize for best science dissertation

671
01:03:46,425 --> 01:03:48,590
has been awarded to one of our own.

672
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:50,132
Laurence Feng.
- Oh, that's great.

673
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:52,090
Take a bow.

674
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:04,965
You! You! You! You! You! You! You!

675
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,132
My God!

676
01:04:08,216 --> 01:04:12,757
My love,

677
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:16,049
As pure as a rose...

678
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:20,257
I brought you a present.

679
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:30,257
Joanna, I didn't even graduate.

680
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:34,507
I didn't say it was a graduation present.

681
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:51,549
You like it?
- Yes.

682
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:58,882
Very old.
- Yeah.

683
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:15,465
Liu Xing, my husband Hal has a business.
He does a lot of business in China.

684
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:16,590
Yeah.
- Yeah.

685
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:20,132
Not in your field.
But it's import export.

686
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:26,840
And I know some of the people.
So, I thought I might contact them.

687
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:30,215
I’m okay. I’m okay.

688
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,757
No problem.
I can find a job myself.

689
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:39,465
Hmm. Of course.
- Thank you.

690
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,715
So I'm not clear on the protocol now.

691
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,090
Liu Xing hasn't passed his dissertation

692
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,132
I’m sure he’ll get his doctorate someday.

693
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:56,924
I mean, he's a brilliant guy.
But unfortunately he's not a team player.

694
01:05:57,466 --> 01:06:02,549
Oh. Well, you wouldn't put that
in a letter of recommendation.

695
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:05,174
No, I wrote him a very fine
recommendation.

696
01:06:05,258 --> 01:06:07,840
You did?
- Believe me.

697
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:12,882
Great. Yeah.
Because I remember when he first came,

698
01:06:12,966 --> 01:06:16,007
you said he was the most brilliant student
you'd ever seen.

699
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:19,215
Yes, and I have no doubt. Yeah.

700
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,465
He’ll make a lasting contribution
to cosmology someday.

701
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:27,007
Somewhere. But...
- Hm.

702
01:06:27,091 --> 01:06:30,340
I wish there were something you could do,
because he looks up to you so much.

703
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:37,590
I don't think he still wants
to work for me, Joanna.

704
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:50,965
Butterfly!

705
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,799
My butterfly!

706
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:14,465
Does he have a girlfriend in America?

707
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:17,590
He's too busy.

708
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,215
Here you go.

709
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:28,174
All he knows is studying, like a fool.

710
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:32,507
Who's going to date him?

711
01:07:44,091 --> 01:07:48,215
Liu Xing, right?
I read your article on Dark Matter.

712
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:54,965
It's really good.

713
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:48,007
Liu Xing!

714
01:08:50,716 --> 01:08:53,382
Liu Xing, such a surprise.

715
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:56,590
Joanna.
- How wonderful to see you.

716
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:03,840
Oh, my God, I was just thinking about you.
- Thank you.

717
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:09,632
Can't even look at the sky
without thinking about Dark Matter.

718
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:12,090
Come in. Can I get you some tea?
- Yes.

719
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:13,465
Good.

720
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:27,590
Come in. Sit down.
- Thank you.

721
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:36,799
it’s so good to see you.
I thought you had disappeared completely.

722
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:42,049
Bach?
- Yes. Yes.

723
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:49,007
Do you have some good news?
- News?

724
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:54,674
Yes. Oh, have you heard
from the other universities yet?

725
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:56,882
No.
- No? Oh, I- I’m sorry, I thought

726
01:09:56,966 --> 01:09:59,049
No.
- Mm.

727
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:13,382
Oh, it's so good to see you.
What is Skin Sheen?

728
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:14,507
Oh...

729
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:22,340
This some beauty product I sell.

730
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:27,590
You sell?
- Just to kill time.

731
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:35,465
And it's... it’s pretty good stuff.
Do you like to try some?

732
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:41,632
Oh, no, thank you. I have a lot of,
God knows, things that I have.

733
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:43,424
Sorry.

734
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:46,340
But... No, I didn't mean... I’m sorry.

735
01:10:46,425 --> 01:10:49,424
Of course I'm always
looking for something new.

736
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:52,840
You know, and just love to try it.
Love to.

737
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,590
Sure?
- Sure.

738
01:10:57,925 --> 01:11:02,465
Oh, shoot.
- Uh-oh. Top came off.

739
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,799
it’s all right. It’s all right.

740
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:17,882
It’s, it's just started.
- Yes, how did I know?

741
01:11:19,716 --> 01:11:26,132
It's quite a line of products.
What do they all do?

742
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:28,840
Okay.

743
01:11:29,216 --> 01:11:34,299
Hand cream. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

744
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:40,465
And, your hand, the first,

745
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,215
you can put it here.
- Yeah. Mm.

746
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,132
And then...

747
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:49,757
And the second...

748
01:11:52,091 --> 01:11:53,507
Oh.

749
01:11:53,591 --> 01:11:55,840
Second, you...

750
01:11:59,216 --> 01:12:04,049
Okay. You put it here, and then...

751
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:08,674
I'm not, I’m not good at it.

752
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:14,590
It's okay. This is good. It’s nice.

753
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:18,090
It's nice.

754
01:12:18,716 --> 01:12:20,215
And...

755
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,757
Mm?
- Yes. And...

756
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:32,799
That's okay.
It really doesn't matter.

757
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:36,340
Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

758
01:12:36,425 --> 01:12:39,465
Yes. Good, good smile.
- Hmm, good smile.

759
01:12:46,216 --> 01:12:49,924
May I?
- Of course.

760
01:12:53,841 --> 01:12:55,549
This...

761
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:15,507
It’s lovely.

762
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:28,215
Liu Xing...

763
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:37,799
I'm sorry.

764
01:13:40,425 --> 01:13:46,590
I sometimes have an
allergic reaction to these things.

765
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:54,882
It's just a temporary job.
- Yes, it's just for a little while.

766
01:13:54,966 --> 01:14:02,299
Then you’ll find something wonderful.
I know you will.

767
01:14:07,716 --> 01:14:10,257
I know you will.

768
01:14:15,716 --> 01:14:22,549
Joanna, I have many,
many things must to do.

769
01:14:22,633 --> 01:14:27,340
Yes. I’m sure.
- I’m so busy.

770
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:32,757
I’m so glad you came to see me though.
- l...

771
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:41,382
I ... l...

772
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:47,674
l...

773
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:51,215
I must go to the library.

774
01:15:09,716 --> 01:15:14,340
Dad, Mom , how are you?

775
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:19,632
Here is the money I saved in America,

776
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:23,007
to repay you for all the gentle care
you have given me.

777
01:18:50,050 --> 01:18:51,757
Excuse me.

778
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:02,090
Marvin Gelman believed

779
01:20:02,216 --> 01:20:06,882
that science could flourish only where
people were free to express their ideas.

780
01:20:06,966 --> 01:20:12,007
The winner of the Gelman Prize came to
America from Communist China 3 years ago,

781
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:15,215
and has flourished at this university.

782
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,715
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr Laurence Feng.

783
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:27,340
By starting at 1 0 to the minus 36 seconds
after the Big Bang,

784
01:20:27,425 --> 01:20:31,632
I have derived new initial conditions
for the Reiser Model,

785
01:20:31,716 --> 01:20:37,632
that generate more accurate predictions of
the present-day structure of the universe.

786
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:41,215
In broad terms, I am providing...

787
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:43,215
What are you doing here?

788
01:21:55,216 --> 01:21:57,882
Liu Xing? What are you doing here?

789
01:22:05,341 --> 01:22:07,799
Is Laurence finished?

790
01:22:10,341 --> 01:22:12,257
Are you all right?

791
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:20,549
Yes?
- Hello. My name is Joanna.
