1
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:11,041
"No Regrets For Our Youth"

2
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,218
The Manchau Revolution created
an excuse for the warlords.

3
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,658
To expand their imperialism.

4
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:39,188
In order to unite the thought of
the people.

5
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,396
They suppressed the opponents.

6
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:47,302
An example is
"the Jingto University Case".

7
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:53,312
The roles in this film are
virtually created.

8
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,444
"Jingto".

9
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,757
Hun.

10
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,835
Teacher.

11
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,546
Father.

12
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:52,748
Smell of the soil is so refreshing.

13
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,493
The sky is so beautiful too.

14
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,499
The wind is so soft.

15
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,572
This makes people feel relaxing.

16
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,272
Here we can see the University.

17
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:25,256
The freedom is the Jingto University.

18
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:31,454
You are a free, prosperous place
for pursuing knowlege.

19
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:44,641
Now it's time to freely
pursue knowledge.

20
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,841
The Manchau Revolution
created Fascism.

21
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,950
Wild has begun to teach again.

22
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,812
Sze, is there any rehersals?

23
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,788
I saw some soldiers.

24
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,631
I like to listen this music best.

25
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:14,004
The rhythm makes people comfortable.

26
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,941
How's that?

27
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,707
Any camels?

28
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,364
So tired.

29
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,809
Since you walked too fast.

30
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,450
"Year 8".

31
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,861
Freedom in the school is collapsing.

32
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,660
The problematic Prof. Pak is fired.

33
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,702
Professors feel angry to the Minister.

34
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,638
We must protect the school
even we have to withdraw.

35
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,005
Jingto Uni Student Association.

36
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,879
The Japanese warlords are
supported by the rich.

37
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,540
To make the Manchau in China
become a semi-colony.

38
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,075
By using the warrior way.

39
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:39,484
To solve the thought problem.

40
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,618
That I believe is the real problem.

41
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,062
You say is always the same.

42
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,429
Talk all about the Manchau
Revolution, warlords and the rich.

43
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,628
I hate the leftists.

44
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,198
Since it's a chain relationship.

45
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,207
To realise the warrior idea.

46
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,174
To compulsively unite all
the different thoughts.

47
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,876
My dad is a man of freedom,
not an opponent.

48
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,817
Person against warrior idea is said
to be an opponent.

49
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,877
My dad is absolutely right.

50
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,888
The right-minded must win.

51
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,222
You dad had said the same.

52
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,828
And the professors resigned to
beg the Minister to self-exam.

53
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,163
But the Minister is the leader of
the powerful party.

54
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,600
It is normal for him to cooperate
with warlords and suppress thoughts.

55
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,575
It's stupid to ask him to regret.

56
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,042
So what do you think good?

57
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,451
To say the cause of this case.

58
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,890
Caused by the militarism.

59
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:53,091
So it's right to fight against
the militarism.

60
00:08:53,966 --> 00:09:00,565
We can't convince the teacher.

61
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,000
The final loser is the University.

62
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,035
You look happy to wait
for the result.

63
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,013
I said that for I hope they win.

64
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,278
However the teachers can't see that.

65
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,112
Only use the childish thought
for failure.

66
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,883
Please stop this embarrassing
conversation.

67
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:28,801
Never thought the world of
many problems.

68
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:34,005
It should have a happy side.

69
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:39,236
Sze, I tell you some good news.

70
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,514
Please follow me.

71
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,746
This is your pitfall.

72
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,956
Why don't you seriously listen
to the others?

73
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:57,657
So you can see your
beautiful world.

74
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,221
Full of caring.

75
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:06,101
Never try to fall, never grow up.

76
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,799
Though your criticism makes me
feel hard.

77
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,208
But the frank say is the most
beautiful words.

78
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,008
Or it's a bubble.

79
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,679
Sze, give me the book.

80
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,292
- Wanna go home?
- Yes.

81
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,686
Please send my regards to teacher.

82
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,629
He's coming, let's have dinner?

83
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,756
I have something to do.

84
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,390
Really?

85
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,402
- Are you back?
- Wanna go back?

86
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,202
Don't say that again.

87
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,736
Do you know the Minister is
proud of himself?

88
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:27,147
Even no regrets to cancel
all the degrees?

89
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,049
You are so great.

90
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,089
The professors at the North-east
University would be in danger.

91
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,701
Perhaps the teacher would not agree.

92
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,101
Anyway I'd stay firm.

93
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,203
The brave deserves admiration.

94
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:54,042
But it should not conflict with
the role of students.

95
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,812
How?

96
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,290
Need to smoke?

97
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,883
Is it OK?

98
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,736
Sze, please sit down.

99
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,313
And apologise to me.

100
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,747
Apologise for what?

101
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,777
Just to what I said.

102
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,386
Please.

103
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,483
Hurry up?

104
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,224
What are you doing?

105
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,965
Don't do that, forget it.

106
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,497
Don't be angry with Wild.

107
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,405
He's rude to everyone.

108
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,957
He just tells the truths.

109
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,295
If it were you, you'd not say.

110
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,174
Sorry to keep you waiting.

111
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,378
I'm also a follower of
academic freedom.

112
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:50,046
How can we keep silent now?

113
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,582
No energy to fight if you're hungry.

114
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,554
He's something good.

115
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:58,057
I like this guy.

116
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,257
If I were a girl, I ought to
be with him.

How's Wild now?

140
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,996
We must be stronger.

141
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,296
Don't be tired.

142
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,495
Treat the failure as victory.

143
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,301
Everybody.

144
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,345
Wish you'd think carefully.

145
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:12,581
We have lost this time.

146
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,460
However everybody.

147
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,828
The justice must win.

148
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,439
Though the flowers wilted this year.

149
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:35,636
To blossom in the righ time.

150
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:43,382
No matter what the difficulties.

151
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:53,122
Most important to learn a lesson.

152
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,703
We fight against the counter party.

153
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,215
In the hard time.

154
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:17,219
To have the precious experience.

155
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,247
Is what we can't forget.

156
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,694
It's so far from Tokyo.

157
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:28,256
Even in this far Tokyo.

158
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,667
Under the shine of Fancism.

159
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:38,540
Self-regulation and freedom
can't stand.

160
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,546
Of course it needs to
avoid self-abandon.

161
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,139
Self-abandon can't solve problems.

162
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,376
We won't be that.

163
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,548
Teacher, we have decided to
fight until we die.

164
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,783
Even we are asked to withdraw.

165
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:56,260
We have no regrets to a
school without freedom.

166
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,192
Thanks.

167
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,765
Thanks a lot for the support.

168
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:09,137
But I can't agree with you.

169
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,242
Teacher, why?

170
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:17,638
Your parents may not allow.

171
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:24,418
To withdraw before graduation.

172
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,822
What a griving thing.

173
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,633
You're looked after by your sister.

174
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:43,439
You'd also think about your sister.

175
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,340
Teacher, so what?

176
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,978
Tough I understand you.

177
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,525
Isn't it the band of seven?

178
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,255
Only five left today.

179
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,387
It is rare.

180
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,921
And the absent are the key men.

181
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,429
How are Sze and Wild?

182
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,701
Went to the University.

183
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:23,308
For three years, for two years.

184
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,649
Although you do not care.

185
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:33,020
Mum is reckoning.

186
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:38,794
Finally it's the last year.

187
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:47,237
But dad can't see it.

188
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,871
Now it's useless to dream.

189
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,839
The assets he left to us.

190
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,384
Frankly we almost finish the savings.

191
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,695
It's good if Wild is here.

192
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,754
Sze is unacceptable.

193
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,562
That guy is always like that
at the critical moment.

194
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,399
How's Sze?

195
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,497
He is a liar.

196
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,064
- Liar?
- No.

197
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,501
Everything is not clear.

198
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,410
What he said today clearly tell us.

199
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,910
How about Wild?

200
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,886
Wild is not coming back again.

201
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,285
Why?

202
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,523
He disappeared one week ago.

203
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,959
Caught by the police?

204
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,427
Released if he's released.

205
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,862
He's not satisfied only
to do activities.

206
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,367
He's a man of perfect.

207
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,437
- Good night.
- Good night.

208
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,669
I am so worried.

209
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,339
Those are the goodness of students.

210
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,809
I mean Hun.

211
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,069
She and Wild...

212
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:41,145
I feel that she's good to Wlld.

213
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,514
Do they only querrel?

214
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:51,119
When she's heard of the
leftist activities run by Wild.

215
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,728
You mean Wild?

216
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,460
I am so worried.

217
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,066
I am worried about her.

218
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,015
Has everyone come?

219
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,573
All gone.

220
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,550
What have they decided?

221
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,657
About what?

222
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,186
To bet for studies or activities.

223
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,733
My dad objects seriously.

224
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,164
Great.

225
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,041
So no other objection.

226
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,003
It's so great.

227
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,912
You won't be said of a liar.

228
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:28,090
I am willing to be a liar.

229
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,488
By doing so I also have some reasons.

230
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,192
You won't understand.

231
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,932
It's so far from Tokyo here.

232
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:15,964
Even in this far away Jingto Uni.

233
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:21,809
Under the shine of Fancism.

234
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,546
Self-regulation and freedom
can't stand.

235
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:33,283
Pain was over yesterday.

236
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,823
"Year 1 3".

237
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,262
Brave to victory.

238
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,564
Promise to go abroad.

239
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,629
How can we die before fighting?

240
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,632
Every time we hear the horn.

241
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:57,043
The flags are showed like waves.

242
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,955
This is good looking.

243
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,328
Pak's art is outstanding.

244
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,101
This is not possible.

245
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,369
Miss Pak.

246
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,701
How is that?

247
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,875
Teacher said.

248
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:40,348
Flower art should show
the true side of oneself.

249
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,087
Just follow your thought.

250
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,441
How's that?

251
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,010
Nothing.

252
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,745
Mum.

253
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,786
Perhaps I'll marry Sze.

254
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,931
Just joking.

255
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,855
Just joking.

256
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,729
Hun, I know he's out.

257
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,913
"Please enter this way".

258
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,421
Sorry to keep you waiting.

259
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,252
Thanks for worrying about me.

260
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,332
- How much is it?
- The fees.

261
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,866
"Free legal aids".

262
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,971
Anything wrong with the job?

263
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:45,273
Anything wrong to work for
the public?

264
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,716
I don't mean that.

265
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:54,156
Teacher was a key man in
the Jingto University case.

266
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,488
Maybe the others discriminate it.

267
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,029
This is lnspector Sze's viewpoint.

268
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:08,164
Please don't be angry.

269
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,538
No, I may have said too much.

270
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,937
Nothing happened?

271
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,252
Mr. Sze.

272
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,227
What do you think the Sze's work?

273
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,129
It's amazing.

274
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,393
Never think of her outstanding work.

275
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,902
Your way of admiration is special.

276
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:46,334
She's a girl but like a boy.

277
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:50,574
The games in primary school.

278
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,785
were all planes, cars etc.

279
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,522
Yes,I'll bring a man here next time.

280
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,229
It may make the family surprised.

281
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,833
Is Wild.

282
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,868
Mum, give me if you don't eat that.

283
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,075
Is Wild good?

284
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,119
He has changed a lot.

285
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,294
I send you to the main door.

286
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,161
Where is teacher?

287
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,065
Academics always leave the guests.

288
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,398
Sorry to bother you.

289
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,932
- Yes, Mr.Sze.
- What?

290
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,967
- About the coming of Mr. Wild.
- Yes.

291
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,411
Is it true?

292
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,936
What do you mean?

293
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,640
I am OK here.

294
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,182
However I think...

295
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,899
- Please don't be that.
- What?

296
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,165
Don't bring Wild here.

297
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,306
Why?

298
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,481
Because l.

299
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,910
Feel scared.

300
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,554
Scared of what?

301
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,585
Wild.

302
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,115
Why?

303
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,527
Foe instance.

304
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,892
The days I follow you are stable.

305
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,069
But it is sorry.

306
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,668
I think the living style
is too simple.

307
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,442
If it's Wild?

308
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,921
If it's with Wild.

309
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,253
I feel the bright shine.

310
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,955
Living would release sharp shine.

311
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,167
Tough it's scary but attractive.

312
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,945
Today's Wild is different.

313
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,415
Five-year made a man changed.

314
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,419
You also changed to be
more matured.

315
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,454
Also the five-year period of Wild.

316
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:54,031
Is the special period in prison.

317
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,132
It's lucky to be caught.

318
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,269
Recalling makes me sweating.

319
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:13,008
But it's a good chance
to learn in prison.

320
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,278
Can study pilosophy and arts.

321
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,413
When were you released?

322
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,050
Just a year ago.

323
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,026
Had replacement sentence last winter.

324
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:34,264
It's hard to be released if
nothing is changed.

325
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,535
This is not wrong.

326
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:43,102
Sze helps me a lot in lnspection.

327
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:47,648
To guarantee my lD and
give me a job.

328
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,219
Human are small and weak.

329
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,821
It's unlike the former Wild.

330
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,789
He used to stand higher than I was.

331
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,325
The shine behind me would hurt you.

332
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,472
Hun.

333
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,702
Hun, how's that?

334
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,163
We need to go.

335
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,637
Wild'll go to China and he's
not coming back shortly.

336
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,102
Please come again.

337
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,407
I should not have come.

338
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,771
How's that?

339
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,700
Hun said she's leaving.

340
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,648
Is she leaving?

341
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:03,450
She's not a child of temper.

342
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,781
Honestly what's happening?

343
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,757
She said she wanted to
live alone in Tokyo.

344
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,257
Why did she say that?

345
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,193
Have you perceived?

346
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,498
Today when she saw Wild leaving?

347
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,603
She finally...

348
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,572
- I know her very well.
- However.

349
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,638
She does the opposite to her thought.

350
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:39,255
I think Hun loves Wild.

351
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:46,795
Do you really want to match them?

352
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:55,533
But Sze hasn't decided when
to take the appointment.

353
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,567
Hun is 25 years old.

354
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:06,742
Do you think Wlld is serious?

355
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,618
I think it's clear.

356
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,652
This is most important.

357
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,222
I am not interested in this.

358
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:22,358
So why did you ask if
Wild was serious?

359
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,626
Where is Hun?

360
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,429
She's in the room.

361
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:33,901
I'm pleased to see her learn
flower arts.

362
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,013
You wait for me here.

363
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,930
- Are you leaving this family?
- Yes.

364
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,936
Now you still haven't decided
like a homeless.

365
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,816
Sit down.

366
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:30,933
Are you confident to live alone?

367
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:40,305
I learned foreign languages
and typing.

368
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,581
Maybe I can find a job in business.

369
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,415
It should be OK.

370
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:57,456
So it can be done in Jingto.

371
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,428
You should think about your mum.

372
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:18,841
I hate everything now.

373
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:26,721
I must forget everything.

374
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,156
To find my own way.

375
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,457
This world.

376
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:43,169
Is unlike what you think to live.

377
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,537
I know.

378
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:59,421
I only feel meaningless to live now.

379
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,955
At least I wish to know.

380
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:14,169
What is living?

381
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,499
I must prove it personally.

382
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,524
I have nothing to say for that.

383
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:41,055
To personally develop my own way.

384
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,764
Indeed it's a important thing.

385
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,898
But Hun.

386
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:54,475
You must be responsible
for your decision.

387
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:03,947
It must pass through
fighting for freedom.

388
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:10,788
And take the responsibility behind.

389
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,594
This point can't be forgotten.

390
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,804
"Year 16".

391
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,943
Left the lecturing room for 8 years.

392
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,752
And I met the prof. again.

393
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,743
It's amazing.

394
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,652
My wife has a flu.

395
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,788
That's no good.

396
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,927
It's not too bad.

397
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:48,193
Since the leaving of the daughter.

398
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,229
I obviously like to annoy.

399
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,905
How's your daughter?

400
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,982
Did she finally go to Tokyo?

401
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:10,678
She has been working for the firm.

402
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,616
But the business isn't good enough.

403
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,224
And said wishing to go to China.

404
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,255
To China?

405
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,691
She's also unhappy.

406
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,028
But I see the feeling.

407
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,865
"Tokyo".

408
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,706
Hun, is it Hun?

409
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,773
Good to see you here.

410
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,785
- Haven't seen you for a long time.
- Neither Have l.

411
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,150
I heard you came to Tokyo.

412
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,154
How about you?

413
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:48,123
I was sent to here.

414
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,588
Are you in a hurry?

415
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,722
No.

416
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,063
Have dinner together?

417
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,795
I wish to talk to you.

418
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:08,736
I am married.

419
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,947
Going to be daddy.

420
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,213
Congratulations.

421
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,982
This is a way to thank parents.

422
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,591
We have separated for a long time.

423
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:30,195
Remember the trip to Hill Gut?

424
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,368
That's also long time ago.

425
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,367
I will come by myself.

426
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,711
We were young.

427
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,282
Please not make a mistake.

428
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,220
And don't mind.

429
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,417
It's unforgettable.

430
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,956
Honestly speaking.

431
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:08,329
"Proposal on Sino-Chinese Problems".

432
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,405
Did you see Wild then?

433
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,243
He's now in Tokyo.

434
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,708
You know nothing about that?

435
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,882
There's a sign in Chuk.

436
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,755
"OPEC Study".

437
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,155
Very obvious.

438
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,127
He's the speakman for the Problems.

439
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,034
And trusted by the financial sector.

440
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,475
It's hard to tell.

441
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:57,887
You are clever to follow him.

442
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:03,887
His living style makes
people jealous.

443
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,822
Since he likes to climb hills.

444
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,776
Three of us used to play and talk.

445
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:27,010
But I was a companion only.

446
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,849
Please.

447
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,503
A guest.

448
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,236
Did not say the name.

449
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,073
Was a girl.

450
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,920
Where is the guest?

451
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,605
Did your parents let you do it?

452
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,166
When was it?

453
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,306
- Leaving home?
- Yes.

454
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,245
The day you visited my home.

455
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,015
Which day?

456
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,121
It was three years ago.

457
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,604
And I changed three jobs.

458
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:45,305
Anyway it's for the living.

459
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:54,250
I really wish it comes true.

460
00:49:54,992 --> 00:50:03,559
Do somthings that make me take part.

461
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:11,706
My dad told me before I left home.

462
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,542
At the back of the beautiful freedom.

463
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,482
Is to take the painful responsibility.

464
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:29,014
I wish to have a job like this.

465
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,220
This is a difficult question.

466
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:39,731
Can a man come across it in life?

467
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,636
Same as whether luck enough
to see the Fortune Bird.

468
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,456
Wild.

469
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:28,648
Do you have any secrets in heart?

470
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,650
Please tell me.

471
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,155
I really want to know.

472
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:39,253
For I know that must be a good thing.

473
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,164
You look different.

474
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,663
How would you imagine my business?

475
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,168
Don't scold me again.

476
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:03,585
I was like this before.

477
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,682
No matter what I'd imagine for it.

478
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,328
But now...

479
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:14,185
I am stupid.

480
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,593
Suddenly shout for the secrets.

481
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,328
I am very embarrassing.

482
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,673
Treated as I said nothing.

483
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:40,344
- But Sze is so worried.
- Sze?

484
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:45,615
Perhaps it's nothing.

485
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:51,819
Just you work here.

486
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,386
Don't know if it's OK.

487
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,930
What do you mean?

488
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,835
Not necessary to know.

489
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:05,899
Really?

490
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,744
I don't quite understand.

491
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:19,785
My work here is under monitor.

492
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,484
I am afraid that I need to use
the tunnel to quit.

493
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:27,595
Now it is not as easy as before.

494
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:33,668
What does he want to do to you?

495
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,000
Not being good.

496
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:41,568
Perhaps this moment is coming soon.

497
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:47,514
So I must try to do.

498
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,638
Hun...

499
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,339
I am afraid the day is coming.

500
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,918
The road ahead is rough.

501
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:00,988
Don't worry.

502
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,553
I am not scared.

503
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,371
Why do you come?
I have said it clearly.

504
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:20,637
Useless.

505
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,474
To me.

506
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:31,779
Must save every minute every second.

507
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,823
Save the time to be with you.

508
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:42,962
How?

509
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,835
To sew this cloth.

510
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,905
Don't know whether you have
a chance to dress.

511
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,815
Return?

512
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,139
Have you written to dad?

513
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,937
Why?

514
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,649
Don't know what to write.

515
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:39,081
Tell him I have a happy family?

516
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,849
I feel sorry to him.

517
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,421
And the Mrs. Master and you.

518
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,634
Why?

519
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,099
Recall the living with no regrets.

520
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,940
Are these our words?

521
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:09,917
No matter how painful.

522
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:16,751
The present living makes
me feel worthy.

523
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:31,832
I just feel difficult to write.

524
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,917
Look at the cloud.

525
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,783
Still remember?

526
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,217
Is it Hill Gut?

527
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:53,092
That time we were young.

528
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,601
To protect the freedom in school.

529
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:27,959
What?

530
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,859
That little worm.

531
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,728
Very beautiful.

532
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:38,129
The little spots are fantastic.

533
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:22,150
Finished one important thing.

534
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,781
I really feel happy.

535
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:29,119
Let's celebrate.

536
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,283
That's good.

537
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,924
Although I don't know what's that.

538
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,196
But I am also happy.

539
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,924
That's not relevant.

540
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,331
You don't need to know why.

541
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:54,240
Just to support me.

542
01:00:58,588 --> 01:00:59,316
Thanks.

543
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:10,092
What we are doing now in 1 0 years.

544
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:15,270
Will be appreciated by Japanese.

545
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:16,903
Do you understand?

546
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,280
How?

547
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,408
What is it?

548
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,247
This thing?

549
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,727
This is my weakness.

550
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,731
Weakness?

551
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,000
My heart is the weakest.

552
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:56,134
Inconvenient to let me know?

553
01:01:56,779 --> 01:02:00,010
You have the right to know.

554
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,450
Is about my parents.

555
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,025
We haven't seen for ten years.

556
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,370
It should be said that we can't see.

557
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:27,175
In the childhood I was scared of dad.

558
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:31,143
And scared of mum to make cry.

559
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,442
Really thought myself so pity.

560
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:43,119
These problems with
parents and children.

561
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,286
Give me some hints to my current job.

562
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:50,990
Indeed what I want to have.

563
01:02:52,468 --> 01:03:01,706
Is the living with no regrets.

564
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,743
I need to go abroad once.

565
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,514
Return before dinner time?

566
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,777
Certainly.

567
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,485
Let me buy you a gift.

568
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,395
I also prepare a great dinner
for you.

569
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,955
I'll be back soon.

570
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,152
Return?

571
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:13,536
If you want to go home early,
just tell us the truth.

572
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:20,214
Anyway we have the evidence.

573
01:05:27,523 --> 01:05:30,356
When did you go with Wild?

574
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,199
When to become the lady of Wild?

575
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,899
Open the mouth to speak.

576
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:53,977
Have enough time for you.

577
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,677
Disguisting.

578
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,720
As stubborn as Wild.

579
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,026
Do you want to see him?

580
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:21,661
But what he is planning is a revenge.

581
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,104
Have you given up? Right?

582
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,042
He's been the spy.

583
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,990
It may be hard for him.

584
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,198
Wild used to be great.

585
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:03,368
You may be interested in what I said.

586
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:26,192

01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,428
Hun.

My wife sends you regards.

598
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,328
No, I am afraid I can't help you.

599
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:15,403
I am the defending man for Wild.

600
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:17,704
Wild?

601
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:24,310
The detials are similar to your say.

602
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,914
Why all Wild does is said spying.

603
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:44,223
Sze, I have left the lecture room
for ten years.

604
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,464
What have you done?

605
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:53,234
I wanted to guide the hot bloody.

606
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,605
- I want to help Wild...
- Teacher.

607
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,844
I must do this way.

608
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,883
- Although I am not young.
- Teacher.

609
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,548
I've decided to be
his defending lawyer.

610
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:23,694
Wild was suddenly dead in the prison.

611
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,855
Hun...

612
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,021
Hun.

613
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:07,310
Can you listen to dad?

614
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,651
Don't say anything.

615
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,686
- But Hun.
- Stop saying.

616
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,496
Stupid.

617
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,873
Aren't you Wild's wife?

618
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:43,985
Think about the meaning
of Wild's fight.

619
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:55,494
Also in order to save Japan to
give up himself.

620
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:01,697
You'd be proud of your companion.

621
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:23,719
WHen you left home.

622
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:29,086
Weren't you prepared?

623
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:37,005
To take responsibility for freedom.

624
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,113
What do you plan to do?

625
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,776
- We need to go to Wild's home.
- Wild's home.

626
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,985
But Hun...

627
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,481
Now only his parents are left.

628
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:04,860
But they won't come back
for the cropse.

629
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:11,032
So I need to go Wild's home.

630
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,930
Do you need to go now?

631
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:16,169
Hun, calm down.

632
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,972
I am Wild's wife.

633
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:41,626
What have I done wrong?

634
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:49,634
To deserve this punishment.

635
01:15:53,115 --> 01:16:00,851
This being revenged son.

636
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:06,990
How can I see the relatives?

637
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,663
But that's a good thing.

638
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:32,681
Give me, there's nothing we can do.

639
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:41,853
You stay here.

640
01:16:54,242 --> 01:17:00,238
We'll come back soon.

641
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:13,224
All the windows are knocked by dad.

642
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:19,295
Our living is like in the hell.

643
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:26,199
"Home of spys".

644
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,893
Just to let me stay.

645
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:51,893
I'll do everything.

646
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,959
No matter what it is.

647
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:55,262
- Don't say that.
- No.

648
01:17:55,737 --> 01:18:00,197
However our living style.

649
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,411
Is totally different from you.

650
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,743
You mean I can't do it?

651
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:10,182
It's OK if you teaches.

652
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,082
Just let me try.

653
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,015
Although it is.

654
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,255
I am prepared.

655
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:22,958
Although we want to do, we can't.

656
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:28,967
Do you know what the
neighbours talk about my family?

657
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:35,240
We are treated as a spy.

658
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,885
Please let me stay.

659
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:09,266
I am Wild's wife.

660
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,873
Please.

661
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:31,727
I won't go back.

662
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,436
Won't go back.

663
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:37,524
This being revenged son.

664
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:02,074
I am Wild's wife.

665
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,982
I am Wild's wife.

666
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,147
What are you doing?

667
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:46,243
Dad asks where are you going?

668
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:50,024
If I don't wait until night.

669
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:54,017
I'll be teased.

670
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:58,365
Hun.

671
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:33,190
Spy...

672
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:41,455
Mum.

673
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:52,391
What?

674
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,742
To recall the living with no regrets.

675
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,379
To recall the living with no regrets.

676
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:29,787
Don't forget the
responsibility for freedom.

677
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:37,804
What we are doing now in ten years.

678
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:42,699
Will be appreciated by Japanese.

679
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:44,776
Do you understand?

680
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,581
To recall the living with no regrets.

681
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,485
To recall the living with no regrets.

682
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,989
Hun.

683
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:34,058
Today I need to wake up
early to farm.

684
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,523
How about you?

685
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:43,032
Don't do it if you are sick.

686
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:48,669
Nothing.

687
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:04,082
Morning.

688
01:32:21,936 --> 01:32:28,705
Your head is combed like hot water.

689
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:07,612
I don't care.

690
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,045
Look.

691
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:22,386
We have farmed a lot.

692
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:33,756
Hun...

693
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:39,601
Don't keep quiet whole day.

694
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,331
Just talk to her.

695
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:49,074
Talk about some minor things.

696
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:54,920
She works so hard for us.

697
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:05,059
This rich wife does not blame.

698
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,301
To farm for us.

699
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:23,147
Why do you pretend blind?

700
01:35:26,087 --> 01:35:31,047
Lung is also...

701
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,392
Why would it be that?

702
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:14,390
Who did it?

703
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:21,107
Did the neighbours destroy our farms?

704
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:28,040
Why were the neighbours so angry?

705
01:36:32,753 --> 01:36:36,154
Where is Hun?

706
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:41,759
Where are you going?

707
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,157
Hun.

708
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:16,858
"Spy can go in".

709
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:27,500
"Spy can go in".

710
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,863
Old dad.

711
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,541
Animals.

712
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:41,278
Disguisting.

713
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:50,082
That's the result from our country.

714
01:39:18,085 --> 01:39:19,245
Hun.

715
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:08,431
Excuse me.

716
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,302
Is Wild's home nearby?

717
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:19,744
The surname is Wild.

718
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:38,097
Shocking.

719
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:41,201
Really shocking.

720
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:57,747
In fact auntie asked me to come.

721
01:40:58,452 --> 01:41:02,252
I disagree you are put in the farm.

722
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:05,521
Wild is unfortunate to go
the wrong way.

723
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:07,750
But you don't need to follow.

724
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,733
I can't win you.

725
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:23,198
It can be said that passion.

726
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:28,614
That strong life makes me shamed.

727
01:41:30,451 --> 01:41:33,682
I always talk to uncle and auntie.

728
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,745
To worry you is the stupid.

729
01:41:51,705 --> 01:41:56,540
Please tell me where
the Wild's grave is.

730
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:01,107
I decided to wipe his grave
by the way.

731
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,413
Not necessary.

732
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:48,623
Maybe normal people would thank you.

733
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:52,726
But I won't.

734
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:07,407
Even Wild wouldn't feel happy.

735
01:43:12,419 --> 01:43:15,320
Perhaps in the eye of lnspector Sze.

736
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:19,118
Only is a unfortunate guy.

737
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:24,629
Which is the right way?

738
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:29,531
Time will give me a judgment.

739
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:53,219
"Lost Freedom reborn day".

740
01:44:28,195 --> 01:44:36,694
I wish he'd see the scene today.

741
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:42,968
Fight for the freedom in school.

742
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:52,342
Fight for the peace and
blessing for Japanese.

743
01:44:53,854 --> 01:45:02,284
The brave heros.

744
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:12,770
He's the pride of our school.

745
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:23,240
That Mr.Wild has passed away.

746
01:45:24,718 --> 01:45:32,625
But the great spirit of Wild.

747
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:42,763
Would be with us forever.

748
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:52,037
I expect there'll be many Wilds.

749
01:45:53,480 --> 01:46:00,977
So I decided to step on the
lecture room again.

750
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:17,492
Very quiet.

751
01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:22,075
How many years like this?

752
01:46:22,776 --> 01:46:28,305
The things happened over
last ten years are like a dream.

753
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:33,077
The current things are the same
as the previous things.

754
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:37,788
Today dad is also going to school.

755
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,624
If you want to stay.

756
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:47,427
Everything at home is
the same as before.

757
01:46:48,435 --> 01:46:50,835
Anyway do you need to go?

758
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:54,463
If Wild's parents all understand.

759
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:59,605
Is your target fulfilled?

760
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:06,677
I have set up a home there.

761
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:09,854
Mum, please look.

762
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:18,387
The hands putting on the piano
doesn't match.

763
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,993
And the work at village is plenty.

764
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:30,172
The living of farmers
especially the girls.

765
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:32,845
Is especially hard.

766
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,140
I hope I can help to improve.

767
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,782
That's my value to live.

768
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:45,923
I am a village culture supervisor.

769
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:52,956
You really were born to work hard.

770
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,456
Why?

771
01:47:55,735 --> 01:47:58,169
I never think about it.

772
01:47:58,205 --> 01:47:59,433
- However.
- No.

773
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:02,770
Don't feel pity to lose.

774
01:48:03,410 --> 01:48:07,574
That's what Wild used to say.

775
01:48:09,683 --> 01:48:12,413
To recall the living with no regrets.

776
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:17,480
Is what I feel happy.

777
01:48:46,653 --> 01:48:53,149
The red flowers on the hill.

778
01:48:53,960 --> 01:49:00,798
The Summer scene at two sides.

779
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:08,630
Don't tell the flowers in the city.

780
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:15,606
The Hill Gut under the shadow
of the moon.

781
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:18,208
END
