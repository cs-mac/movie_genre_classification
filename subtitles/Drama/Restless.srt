THE RESTLESS
(Subtitle: Ninjutzu)

2
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,878
In the be ginning of mid school
I wrote a list of my dreams.

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,318
Many kids,
a house by the sea...

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,998
World peace, family...

5
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,352
Me a gainful work...

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,274
Not to hurt any one...

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,590
A woman to love,
to be happy...

8
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,232
It's been a while
since I wrote the list.

9
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,958
Some dreams have come true,
some haven't. Some don't matter.

10
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,115
My life's empty.
Nothing feels like any thing.

11
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,118
I feel nothing.

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,114
The passenger is ok.
-Does it hurt?

13
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,430
Am I going to die?
-No.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,349
Can you move your legs?
Your hands?

15
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,072
What happened?
-His heart. He fainted.

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,794
Sinus rhythm.
-Good. No panic.

17
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,510
Excuse me.

18
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,395
Would you like to fuck me?
-Yeah.

19
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,235
See you.

20
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,792
It's alright, Mother.

21
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,508
I'm here.

22
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,274
Score!

23
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,751
What's up, pretty boy?

24
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,673
Oh, shit! Stop it!

25
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,753
I'm gonna puke!

26
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,390
Don't bother
taking off the condom.

27
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,671
We've got the same VD's.

28
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,591
Some mornings I feel empty.

29
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,111
Someone said
you get used to anything.

30
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,111
I was okay,
but I was hoping for a change.

31
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,997
Hey hey!

32
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,158
Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

33
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,913
You can borrow my towel.
-No thanks. I'm almost dry.

34
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,551
No, take it. It's clean.

35
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,670
Thanks.

36
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,551
I'm Ari.
-Tiina.

37
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,152
Pretty warm
for this time of the year.

38
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,751
Thanks for the towel.
-No problem.

39
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,153
Would you like some coffee?
If you're not in a hurry.

40
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,159
No...
I'm not in a hurry.

41
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,393
Typical...

42
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,751
What do you do,
besides fixing girls' bikes?

43
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,315
I go to work.
-What do you do?

44
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,993
I'm a doctor. -I'm working on
my Master's thesis. On literature.

45
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,038
What do you do for fun? -I go
to movies, sometimes to a bar.

46
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,108
With your friends?
-I live here.

47
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,956
Are you sure it's not
too much trouble? -Yeah.

48
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,914
This won't take long.

49
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,239
Nice place. -I've only
lived here a little while.

50
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,513
My place is dumb.
It's ok ay, really...

51
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,195
Thanks for fixing my bike.

52
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,595
No one's ever done
that to me before.

53
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,638
What's this?
-It's a long story.

54
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,715
Who are you calling?
-You're calling me.

55
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,197
What are you thinking about?
-My Mom.

56
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,354
She's dying.

57
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,988
It could take weeks or months.

58
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,518
I don't get it. How'd it happen?

59
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,951
I just went for it.
He's a doctor.

60
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,073
Did you score?
-Twice.

61
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,078
Was he good?
-Take a guess.

62
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,598
Are you still going on about
the gigolo on the beach?

63
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,551
And you tamed him?
-Stop it. He's a regular guy.

64
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,355
Really cool that you made it.

65
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,674
Doctors are usually so stuck up.
You're not.

66
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,154
Go on, answer it.
-No.

67
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,554
Is it an old flame?
-Kind of.

68
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,716
How come you don't answer?
Is she an ugly cow?

69
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,838
No, I just never date.

70
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,551
In a minute!

71
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,916
Never?
-I don't want to hurt any one.

72
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,714
Dad!

73
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,555
Attack!

74
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,556
Smile!

75
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,589
Look over there.

76
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,599
Is this an 8?
-Yeah.

77
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,918
Hi! We have news for you.
-We decided to get married.

78
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,073
Congratulations!

79
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,680
Congratulations!

80
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,750
Look, my colleagues
gave us this game.

81
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,157
''Test your relationship.''
-Let's play.

82
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,592
We're five.
You need even pairs.

83
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,994
Let's play cards instead.
Any cards in the boat?

84
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,033
Stop it!

85
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,756
There's still some left.

86
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,469
Answer!

87
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,312
Why don't you date occasionally?

88
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,912
Just for the hell of it.

89
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,076
The skins are the best.

90
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,438
How come?
-They're good for you.

91
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,796
What's your sign?
-What's yours?

92
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,590
Didn't God give us
a wonderful gift?

93
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,112
God gave us the gift of sex
as part of marriage.

94
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,511
Thousands of young people
have made a commitment -

95
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,152
to abstain from sex
before marriage. Join us.

96
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,395
True love waits!
-Thanks.

97
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,597
Do you want some dry clothes?
-A dress would be nice.

98
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,269
How about this?
-Let's see...

99
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,918
I made some coffee.

100
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,593
I really like to be with you.
-But what?

101
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,118
Are you spoken for? Married?
-No.

102
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,397
Gay? You have aids?
-No.

103
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,070
Then we're okay.
-I don't feel anything.

104
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,953
What?
-Nothing at all.

105
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,118
Don't you like me?

106
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,116
I'll make you unhappy.

107
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,115
Let me worry about
my happiness, okay?

108
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,396
I have to go.
-You're not going any where.

109
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,950
More...

110
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,953
Morning!
-You can tell he's got a new girl.

111
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,708
Doesn't let him sleep!

112
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,594
You'll soon be on vacation.

113
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,158
You can tend to
her night and day then.

114
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,277
Did she give you a blow job?

115
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,635
Did she give you a blow job,
blow job...

116
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,830
Did you use a condom?

117
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,349
Did you do it doggy style?

118
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,157
Sorry.
-Again. You could've called.

119
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,078
I am sorry.
-Yeah, right.

120
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,312
I'd love to do this
when I'm old.

121
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,152
Give me candy.

122
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,558
How long has it been?
-Three weeks.

123
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,513
Should we check him out?

124
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,791
And try him out.
-Don't stay long if you do.

125
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,993
We won't come.

126
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,112
We've seen it all before.

127
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,271
You haven't seen him before.

128
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,079
What if he's not home?
-Leave the cake outside his door.

129
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,516
Does my ass look big? -You have
the prettiest ass in the world.

130
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,075
Is this too romantic?
-Go on!

131
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,990
Congratulations!

132
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,392
Why?
-It's your birthday.

133
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,156
Do you have coffee?
-Wait...

134
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,676
Hello.
-Hi.

135
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,479
Well, you two can have the cake.
-Thanks, but I really have to go.

136
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,874
She's Päivi.

137
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,119
I hope you're not allergic
to almonds. -No.

138
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,797
Have fun.

139
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,674
Does she mean something to you?
-No.

140
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,991
Do I?
-I don't know.

141
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,838
I told you this would happen.
-Oh, you said so.

142
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,070
Then it's okay, right?
I was warned.

143
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,118
Do you care?
-I do.

144
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,190
Do you want to be with me or not?
-I can't.

145
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,634
Fine, whatever...
-Tiina!

146
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,437
I want all of you!

147
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,113
Let me know
if you change your mind.

148
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,111
Change your stupid mind, you idiot!

149
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,998
Sorry.
-It's okay.

150
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,835
Better it should happen now
than after 15 years of marriage.

151
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,837
He's not worthy of you.
-It's not that simple.

152
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,675
He's not totally bad.
-Yeah, right!

153
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,476
How come you ain't dancing?
-I rarely dance.

154
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,074
You're not thirsty, either?

155
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,038
I could be.

156
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,870
Come in.

157
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,392
This is Pera.

158
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,589
This is Ari.

159
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,148
Did you mean to fuck my wife?

160
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,116
Yes.

161
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,790
Go ahead, then.
Don't just fucking stand there!

162
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,032
Never mind him. Come on.

163
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,637
Why are you doing this?
-Come here.

164
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,669
You'll make a fine husband
for someone.

165
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,673
A man can kill his own dog, right?

166
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,595
Was she a good fuck?

167
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,798
Hi.

168
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,030
Hi.
What happened to your head?

169
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,392
I changed my mind.

170
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,438
Sit down.

171
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,994
Careful now.

172
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,549
Hello! This is Ari.

173
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,712
Stig. -Ari.

174
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,156
I'm Riku.

175
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,150
I'm Ilona. Nice to meet you.
-Like wise.

176
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,280
Hanna-Riikka owns the boat.

177
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,594
Ari's a doctor.
-I knew it.

178
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,037
I knew you'd say that.

179
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,279
It's harder to guess in advance.
-Not if you know how to look.

180
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,157
Can Ari guess what
I'm studying? -No.

181
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,799
There's a psychologist,
an archaeologist -

182
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,199
a priest and an economist.
-And one autistic person.

183
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,157
And one literary historian.
-Midsummer of the nerds.

184
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,151
Literature -

185
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,035
economy, archaeology -

186
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,355
psychology.
Psychologists are quiet.

187
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,035
Priest or autistic?

188
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,151
Priest.
-Pretty good!

189
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,553
You got the archaeologist and the
psychologist wrong. -No big deal.

190
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,154
I've never understood
her weird jokes.

191
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,154
Score!
-I've never called a 999-number.

192
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,669
You'll catch up.

193
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,271
I've never ordered red wine
in a restaurant.

194
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,156
I've never eaten shit.
-Yuck!

195
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,630
Zero points.
Why would any one do that?

196
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,117
I've never used a seat belt.

197
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,997
Score.

198
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,036
I've never met
this wonderful Ari before.

199
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,713
My points never count!

200
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,318
M... I... D...

201
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,635
..S... U... M... M... E... R,
Midsummer!

202
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,074
Happy Midsummer!

203
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,232
Let's party!

204
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,594
We're done with traditions now.

205
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,716
What's the tattoo?
-I lost a bet when drunk.

206
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,668
I've never lost a bet.
-Score!

207
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,993
It's a game called ''I've never''.

208
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,757
If you've never done something
all others have, you get a point.

209
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,152
The biggest wimp gets points.
-Or the smartest.

210
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,238
The wimp, that is.
-Fine.

211
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,714
Try it.

212
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,709
I've never hit a woman.
-Me neither.

213
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,156
Did Tiina tell you?
-Tell me what?

214
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,390
I hit Ilona once. I was drunk.

215
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,115
I've never regretted
anything so much.

216
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,119
I've never heard about it.

217
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,757
You get a point.
-Congratulations, your first!

218
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,878
I've never believed in God.

219
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,033
Point for Riku. What does Ari say?

220
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,271
I've never used drugs.
-Me neither.

221
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,915
I've never swallowed sperm.
-Yuck. Who has?

222
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,069
I've never
broken a bone in the Alps.

223
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,754
I've never cursed
in front of my Dad. Or Mom.

224
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,232
I've never bought tax-free beer.
-Unbelievable. Point.

225
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,398
I've never drank
a whole cup of coffee.

226
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,549
Incredible. Point!

227
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,397
I've never been
any one's only best friend.

228
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,870
I've never gotten breakfast in bed.

229
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,351
I've never seen my Dad.

230
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,031
I've never cried in front of
someone as a grown-up.

231
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,635
Me neither.

232
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,914
I've never been this happy.
-Accepted.

233
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,756
I've never...

234
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,835
Go on.

235
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,195
I've never been in love.

236
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,670
I've never liked Midsummer.

237
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,357
What's wrong with me?

238
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,758
Nothing.

239
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,910
I always fall for the wrong guys.

240
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,235
You just don't feel wrong.

241
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,149
I'll bet he's not around
in a few weeks.

242
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,473
Bullshit, he's a good guy.

243
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,117
You're always judging people.
It's unfair.

244
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,593
I have a right to do so,
I'm a priest.

245
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,030
Hey, I'm joking!
-Which part was the joke?

246
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,189
The bottom.

247
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,635
You know what?

248
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,276
I've got flowers
under the pillow.

249
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,874
Look.

250
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,918
I'll dream about
my future husband now.

251
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,996
Did you throw?
-Hit in the side.

252
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,193
Come to papa!

253
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,149
You sure slept long.
-Can I help?

254
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,432
You can wash the potatoes.
-I'll do it.

255
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,113
Watch out for snakes.

256
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,272
Are you having fun?
-Sure.

257
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,715
I've never been in love either.
-That messes up the scores.

258
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,759
No, really.

259
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,119
Why are you with Stig then?
-Why are you with Tiina?

260
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,239
Maybe you just get
used to having someone.

261
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,956
We're getting married in the fall.

262
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,428
Love is not all that matters.
-No.

263
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,593
Then again, how would I know?
-You don't.

264
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,714
Dinner time!

265
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,274
Come and eat!

266
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,680
Bread and wine.

267
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,912
Will you say a prayer?
-No.

268
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,188
Why did you want to be a priest?
-Why did you want to be a doctor?

269
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,636
Nice job. Good money.
-Blood and bowels.

270
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,113
Are you specialized?
-He's an ambulance doctor.

271
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,158
Ambulogist.
-I wanted to be a paediatrician.

272
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,233
Do you want to help kids?

273
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,595
Isn't it obvious?

274
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,069
I used to think so, I guess.
-People spend 90 % of their time -

275
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,871
continuing with something
they once started.

276
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,471
Someone said that.
-For me that's 100 %.

277
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,033
Why? Do you think there's
anything good and true in life?

278
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,635
The right answer is Jesus.

279
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,430
Christianity is the
whole damn answer for me.

280
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,355
What is it to Ari? -Not all
people believe in something.

281
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,599
Yes they do,
or they're not human.

282
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,832
I must be a monkey then.

283
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,956
Did you lock up?
-Oh, me? I guess so.

284
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,998
Is my jacket there?
-Yes.

285
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,597
Mom...

286
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,559
Mom.

287
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,398
This is Tiina.

288
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,639
She can hear us.

289
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,789
Sorry I'm late.
-For a change. Where's Ilona?

290
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,311
I don't know.
Did she call? -No.

291
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,958
They cancelled my study grant.
I can't pay my rent anymore.

292
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,878
Can't you move to Ari's place?
-I don't know what he wants.

293
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,396
Ari speaking.

294
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,151
Hi.

295
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,068
Didn't you go to the concert?

296
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,111
Yeah, I'm interested.

297
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,553
Hello. -Hi.

298
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,039
Nice room.

299
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,596
Do you want a drink?
-Do you?

300
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,950
I wasn't sure you'd come.
-Well, here I am.

301
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,595
Second thoughts? -No.

302
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,277
This doesn't make any sense.
-Should it?

303
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,913
Is Tiina on top when you fuck?
Do you like that?

304
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,633
Do you feel good?
-Yeah.

305
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,872
Here you go.

306
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,872
Dry your pants.

307
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,397
Hi. -Hello.

308
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,675
It was a great concert.
Too bad Ilona missed it.

309
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,910
You have juice? I'm thirsty.
-Yeah, help yourself.

310
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,073
I brought you coffee.

311
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,358
You're beautiful.

312
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,709
I've been thinking...

313
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,115
Do you want to get married?
-What?!

314
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,119
Would you like to marry me?

315
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,872
Would you?
-I asked you.

316
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,759
I'm not against it.
-That's no reason to get married.

317
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,754
Do you want to?
-I'm asking you.

318
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,954
I feel stupid.
I just want to be with you.

319
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,718
You can move in here if you
want to. -Do you want me to?

320
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,437
I've got nothing...
-Don't say that!

321
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,114
What do you want?

322
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,591
It hurts me when you don't talk.

323
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,799
I can't move in with you
if you don't care.

324
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,958
Looks like I lost the bet.

325
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,273
I made a bet that your
thing wouldn't work. -Sorry.

326
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,592
It's okay
as long as Tiina wins.

327
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,919
At least I'm moving in here
in record time.

328
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,839
What time is it?

329
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,796
Seven.

330
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,118
Do you like me touching your ass?

331
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,154
I think it's fun.
-Good.

332
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,833
Hello.
-Hi.

333
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,157
We're going out.
I'll just take a shower.

334
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,030
Did you go to the store?
-No. I'll go later.

335
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,313
How are you?
-Good.

336
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,030
Tiina's unhappy.
-How so?

337
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,108
She's not showing it to you.
-She does to you?

338
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,434
I can tell.
She's my best friend. I love her.

339
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,590
You're not serious with her.

340
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,112
You pretend.
Or maybe you're scared.

341
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,557
Isn't every one?
-No.

342
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,352
Are you serious about Riku then?
-Yeah.

343
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,676
But that's different.
-Why?

344
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,029
Because we're talking
about you and Tiina.

345
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,276
What do you want me to do?
-Think logically.

346
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,995
Why logically?

347
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,635
I don't care if you think with your
dick, but Tiina deserves happiness.

348
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,035
You should know that happiness
doesn't need to be deserved.

349
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,757
There are different views within
the church. -What's yours?

350
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,828
That happiness
doesn't need to be deserved.

351
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,194
You'd be easier to hate
if you weren't so smart.

352
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,033
The doctor checks the ear.

353
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,028
It's fine.
-Good.

354
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,597
Time to fight the dragons!

355
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,593
This is good practice for you.

356
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,791
When's the wedding?

357
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,836
You've gotten a ring,
haven't you?

358
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,871
Something's bothering you.
What is it? -I don't know.

359
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,397
Am I too pushy?

360
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,556
Should we split up?

361
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,878
Are you happy?

362
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,839
About what?
-Everything.

363
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,792
No. I don't know
what to do with Stig. -Marry him.

364
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,838
Sure, we're doing just fine...

365
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,038
What am I to you?

366
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,709
A friend.

367
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,759
Who's available, right?

368
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,713
What was that?
-I'll start again.

369
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,433
You blew it. I slapped twice
and you continued.

370
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,871
No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

371
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,520
Take your hand off!
-Are you gonna hit me?

372
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,595
Ilona!

373
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,115
She hates everything about me.
-Sit down. This is an island.

374
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,996
At least she won't run
to another guy.

375
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,075
Except for the trolls with five-foot
dicks. -We weren't supposed to tell.

376
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,758
If your friend was cheating
on his partner, would you tell?

377
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,674
It's their business.
-Whose?

378
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,158
Their. -How can it be their business
if only two know about it?

379
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,919
Let every one deal with
their own lives. -Forget it.

380
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,949
Let's finish the game!

381
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,035
You still got only one hand!

382
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,311
Shall we play?
-What?

383
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,077
The truth game. We ask 3 questions
and the answer has to be the truth.

384
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,959
What if you lie?
-We don't lie.

385
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,308
One: why are you with Tiina?
-I want her to be happy.

386
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,831
Two: why are you
fucking Ilona then?

387
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,148
Three, was I right?

388
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,068
Ilona is nice.
-Are you nice?

389
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,153
That's the fourth question.
-Liar.

390
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,075
I don't lie much. Tiina doesn't know
and she doesn't need to.

391
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,075
But I do and it hurts.
Soon you'll be hurting, too.

392
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,273
It'll hurt e very time
Tiina touches you -

393
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,349
and every time you screw Ilona,
you'll be thinking of Tiina -

394
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,279
who thinks you're at work
or something.

395
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,031
Do they teach that to future
priests? -I'm self-educated.

396
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,993
I learnt my lesson
a long time ago.

397
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,515
Are you happy?
-Irrelevant.

398
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,149
My turn. Are you happy?
-No.

399
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,753
I knew it! -Do everything right
and you'll feel fine.

400
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,271
If you do everything wrong,
you'll feel bad. -Stop it.

401
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,637
Girls always fall for
such god dam cowards!

402
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,430
Including you?
My second question.

403
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,272
We're like a family.
Don't fuck it to pieces.

404
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,069
Hey.
-Hi.

405
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:55,111
Don't ruin others' relationships.
-I'm tired of your bullshit.

406
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,029
Wait, let's talk about it.
-What?

407
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,992
Let's talk. -Go fuck yourself,
you hypocrite dyke!

408
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,116
What do you wanna do?
-This makes no sense.

409
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,793
I want to end this.
-Okay.

410
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,589
It's not what you think.
We just...

411
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,470
Go on, get out.

412
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,229
I should hit you in the face.
-I'd better go.

413
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,836
Is this a ringing in my ears?

414
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,709
This wouldn't happen
if we had a sex life.

415
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,835
Hello.
-You're late.

416
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,310
Why didn't you tell me?

417
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,230
I didn't wanna hurt you.
-What?!

418
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,591
I didn't wanna hurt you.

419
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,589
I warned you.
-Stop saying that!

420
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,831
I've just moved in.
This is me!

421
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,713
You don't love any one!

422
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,353
Go fuck my best friend,
but don't fuck me after that.

423
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,151
What are we gonna do now?

424
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,357
Go to hell!

425
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,152
And don't come back,
you bastard!

426
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,715
You bastard...

427
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,714
How's Tiina?

428
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,993
She took it pretty bad.
-So did Stig.

429
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,911
This can't be forgotten.

430
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,036
I hope he'll forgive me.
I'd like to try again.

431
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,309
It's best we don't see anymore.

432
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,077
Take care.
We had fun, didn't we?

433
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,629
Yeah.

434
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,720
See you!

435
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,991
You sure it's okay
I spend the night?

436
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,790
Sure. I can't sleep.

437
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,513
I'd kill my self if I dared.
-Stop that.

438
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,430
I'm the biggest asshole in town.

439
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,034
How's your vacation?

440
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,479
Awful. I've been drunk all day.
-Why?

441
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,915
Pia's been mad.
-About what?

442
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,713
About the drinking.

443
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,794
Now she's gone for good.

444
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,308
She's not gone.
She's out back, sulking.

445
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,875
Really?
-Yes.

446
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,158
You mean that?
-Yes.

447
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,319
Do me a favour, go get her.
-What do I say to her?

448
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,074
Tell her to come back.
-Why don't you go?

449
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,959
You have a way with women.
You know how to talk to them.

450
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:37,955
Do you want me to shoot her?
-No.

451
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,678
I just don't want to keep it here
when I'm alone.

452
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,360
And hey...
Get me more beer, too.

453
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,308
Come on.
-Why should I?

454
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,278
Because Roope loves you.

455
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:13,115
You don't know what it's like.
-To be in love?

456
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,558
To have kids.
-No, I don't.

457
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,155
Please, don't do that.

458
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,229
Let's see...

459
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,715
The result is positive.
-What does that mean?

460
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,510
You're pregnant. Congratulations.

461
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,591
Thank you.

462
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,277
It's a big change.
-Yes, it is.

463
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,669
Hey.

464
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,953
I just called because I haven't
heard from you in a while.

465
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,880
Where do you live now?
-Nowhere, really.

466
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,998
That's too bad.
-Yeah.

467
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,517
When are you going back?
-I don't think I can.

468
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,992
But it's your place.
Have you called her? -No.

469
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,112
You can stay with us until
you get your things sorted out.

470
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,756
What will it be?
-Two beers, please.

471
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,994
God bless.
-Hi honey.

472
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,034
Ari!

473
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:40,430
What's up?
-Just watching TV.

474
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,790
No beer for me?
-I'll get you one.

475
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,155
Where's the spare key?
Ari will stay here a few days.

476
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,834
I can't remember.

477
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,154
What's a few days?
-You won't be here!

478
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,111
I don't trust him.
-You're wrong.

479
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,151
Hello.
Where's Riku?

480
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:37,356
He went to a congress.
He'll be back in a few days.

481
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,950
Does it bother you that I'm here?

482
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,072
Want some tea?
-No.

483
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,753
Why is everything so complicated?
-I don't know.

484
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,593
What do you want?
-I don't know, sex.

485
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,797
I'd like to find the answer.

486
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,154
To which question?
-I don't know. All of them.

487
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,798
What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

488
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,395
Completing the series, huh?
-No.

489
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,589
Next you'll be touching
Riku and Stig. -I doubt it.

490
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,828
Are you serious?

491
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,434
I'll be damned...

492
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,156
You don't care about me.

493
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,238
Yes, I do.
-''Yes, I do.''

494
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,195
May I kiss you?
-Shut up.

495
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,274
Shit...

496
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,750
You only fuck your
friends' girlfriends, huh?

497
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,392
I didn't force any one.
-Good night.

498
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:43,751
This is my childhood hero,
uncle Fedja.

499
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,079
A serious boy
who left home when he was eight.

500
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:54,035
He sits on my shoulder now.

501
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,273
I see.

502
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,232
Don't get any ideas, ok?
-What?

503
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,470
Last night meant nothing.
I just tried it out.

504
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,191
To measure up with my friends.

505
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,274
What happened?
-Nothing.

506
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,679
You were
quite a disappointment.

507
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,670
Now get the fuck out of here.

508
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,799
Hello. -Hi.
I came to get some stuff.

509
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,639
I've been trying to call you.
It's important.

510
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,994
They called last night.

511
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,678
Your Mom's dead.

512
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,076
I see...

513
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,829
"Merry Christmas, Ari. Dad."

514
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,674
I should become forting you.
-I should get a place.

515
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,034
You already have one.
Just move in. -Where will you go?

516
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:28,154
I'll stay until I find a place.

517
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,155
I'll sleep on the couch.

518
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,317
You're confused, Tiina.

519
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,956
I don't want to be alone.

520
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,071
Find another guy.

521
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:56,629
You've only known Ari for 3 months.
-It's not that simple.

522
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:03,039
Cut the bullshit.
-What bullshit?

523
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,194
What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

524
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,953
I need you on my side.
-It's not gonna work out.

525
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,913
You know that too.

526
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,239
You always tell people
to love and to believe.

527
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,798
I do like hell.

528
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,876
Don't curse in here.

529
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,071
Fuck you.

530
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:41,592
The body that is sown is perishable,
it is raised imperishable.

531
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:47,191
Jesus is resurrection and life.

532
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,512
Good night.
-Good night.

533
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,239
What if I came over there?

534
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,917
Go ahead.

535
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,352
No strings attached.

536
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,032
I missed you.

537
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,678
I don't know. It hurt really bad.

538
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,318
I'm really sorry.

539
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,799
A toast to us!

540
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:12,110
Ilona and Stig are still together.
The y're getting married.

541
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,395
Hanna-Riikk a
will perform the ceremony.

542
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,434
I'll be Ilona's bridesmaid.
We have made up.

543
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,235
Where are you going?
-Out for a while.

544
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,950
Hi.
-Hello.

545
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,193
I'm sorry about your Mom.
-Thanks.

546
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,229
Do you wanna get wasted?

547
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,749
Sure...

548
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,469
Can we join you? I'm Erja.

549
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,392
There's a party at the
nursing school. Interested?

550
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,149
Yeah, because... I'm sick.

551
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,314
Go fuck yourself.
-I just wanna talk.

552
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,956
Let's share a cab, I'll pay.
-But I've moved.

553
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:43,433
Where?
-I've moved alone.

554
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,756
Hanna-Riikka left me.

555
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,274
Why don't you answer my calls?

556
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,150
Because I can see who's calling.

557
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:43,074
It's weird that my best friend's
boy friend calls me at night.

558
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,748
I'm not with Tiina.
-Don't lie to me.

559
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,352
How are you?
-Good and bad.

560
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,070
Why do you ask?

561
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,431
Why did you leave Riku?

562
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,553
I wanna do
what's right in this situation.

563
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,910
It seemed
the right thing to do.

564
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:15,115
Why?
-Why?

565
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,914
Don't...

566
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,435
Do you think you could love me?

567
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,875
You'd have to change.

568
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,911
Did you have fun?
You're a little late.

569
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,999
I've been thinking...

570
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,269
I should have said this before
but I didn't know how.

571
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,388
I think...
-Ari.

572
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,637
I'm pregnant.
-What?

573
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,430
We're having a baby.

574
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,559
I know what you are.
But I love you any way.

575
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,595
I'll be a good mother.
I want this child.

576
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,599
I can care for it alone.

577
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,913
We can live together,
as friends.

578
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:58,956
I won't ask any questions.
You live your life and I live mine.

579
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,029
We'll take care of the child
together.

580
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,479
We don't have
to be like every one else.

581
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,509
I'd like to stay
if it's OK with you.

582
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:15,277
We can give it a try.
-I want to be a father to the kid.

583
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,748
Look how small it is!

584
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,311
Nice to work with you again.
How was the holiday? -Okay.

585
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,151
I'm glad it's over.
I got sober again.

586
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,717
Things are better at home.
How are you doing? -Okay.

587
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,918
You can be saved
from meaningless sex!

588
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,114
You, too, can find true love.

589
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,797
True love waits.
Let us pray.

590
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,669
Black humour.

591
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,029
I could come late.
Oh, call Riku.

592
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:39,392
Congratulations. You're
going to be a dad. -Thanks.

593
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,915
I didn't tell Riku anything,
you know.

594
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,996
I think about you all the time.

595
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:57,951
You missed the train.
-Right.

596
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,632
Hanna-Riikka! Are you coming?

597
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,078
See you in hell.

598
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,272
I know where we are.
The smell is so bad.

599
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,277
Fuck, did you get us hookers?
-You'll see.

600
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,637
Is it human or animal?

601
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,592
It's hard to tell...
-If it's a lamb, I won't fuck it.

602
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,397
What a surprise...

603
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,000
Let's move on.

604
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,472
It's a big change.

605
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:20,234
I'm glad I didn't hit you.

606
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:32,033
I've learned something about life.
I used to take things for granted.

607
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,473
I should thank you.
-You're welcome.

608
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,952
I'm proud of not hitting Ilona.

609
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:55,834
Tell us how you feel, Ari.
-Let's forget all this.

610
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,878
Is this the end of the party?

611
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,590
We could come up
with something else.

612
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:20,838
Ari, you're a real bastard!

613
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,629
Have fun!
-Shit, no... guys!

614
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,593
Don't leave me!

615
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,876
This is not funny!

616
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:47,752
I'll be...

617
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,838
Bulls eye!

618
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:57,075
Come on in, girls.
-We can go to a hotel.

619
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,158
We won't hurt you.

620
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,428
Are you a hockey star or something?
-Yeah. Come, I'll show you.

621
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,639
I know all the right people.

622
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:30,119
Stig, tell me something.
How old are they?

623
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:33,597
They said they were 16.

624
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,996
Are you happy?
-At the moment, no.

625
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,508
Shit! I've got hair in my mouth.

626
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,469
Well, maybe 80 % happy.
Or 78.5 %.

627
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,589
Ari, would you be my best man?

628
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,714
Isn't Riku the best man?
-Let him take care of the music.

629
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,953
Our marriage
is more your department.

630
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:10,078
A friend gave it to me
to throw away. -Never!

631
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,957
You can have it
if you promise not to shoot any one.

632
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,109
Wake up!

633
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,193
Turku is a great place
to live and prosper.

634
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,948
We had fun.

635
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,910
Ilona was quite drunk
and Hanna-Riikka puked.

636
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,351
How about you?
-A small party.

637
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,679
Stig asked me to be his best man.

638
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,230
Good. We can plan
the wedding together then.

639
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:33,159
Will the guests fit into one boat?
-Hope so.

640
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,030
Did you invite
any of your colleagues?

641
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:46,072
Don't exhaust yourselves,
tomorrow's a big day.

642
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,111
You're not putting all that?
-Count your own rice.

643
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,390
Who, me?

644
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,952
Are we gonna be like this
when we're 60?

645
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:09,113
Let's play. I've never
kissed a woman. -Score.

646
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,154
I've never liked being single.
-Me neither.

647
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,397
I've never worn a seat belt.

648
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,719
You've said that before.
-Not on this trip.

649
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,956
This is boring,
nothing new comes up.

650
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:30,193
I've never had an orgasm
during intercourse.

651
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,036
That's settled then...
Let's continue.

652
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:44,035
No one has to do anything.
-Can we at least try?

653
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,918
I'll do it.

654
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:00,915
I wouldn't go to Iceland
on my honey moon.

655
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,708
It must be cold out there.

656
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:06,111
This is wonderful.

657
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,670
It'll take a while
before the sauna's ready.

658
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,709
I like mild heat.
-It's really mild.

659
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,758
Where are the others?
-At the store.

660
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:39,110
How does it feel to become a dad?
-Weird.

661
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,117
It's hard to imagine.

662
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,876
I want you one more time.

663
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:00,148
Tomorrow I'll be a decent wife.

664
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,995
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

665
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,558
We are gathered here -

666
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:08,238
for the wedding of Ilona and Stig.

667
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:15,991
I've known them both
for a long time.

668
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,713
We'll stop here.

669
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,914
Why are you doing this?
-I don't know.

670
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,030
Till death do you part?

671
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,917
I do.

672
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:38,153
In the presence
of this congregation -

673
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,916
I ask you,
Ilona Helmi Ilmarinen -

674
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,114
will you take
Stig as your husband -

675
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:51,678
to love and cherish
till death do you part?

676
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,877
I do.

677
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:17,670
With the powers vested in me -

678
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:21,033
I pronounce you
husband and wife.

679
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:24,750
In the name of
the Father, the Son -

680
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,276
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

681
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,109
Well done, Tiina!

682
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,114
Any unmarried men?
Come here.

683
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,511
Someone could propose to me now.

684
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,679
I'd like to talk to you.
-Now?

685
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:56,470
We're fooling ourselves.
We can't live like this.

686
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,595
I agree.

687
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,316
I think we should be together.

688
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:08,556
I think we shouId split up.
-Why?

689
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,229
I can't do it.

690
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:16,232
Yes, you can. I love you.

691
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,315
I'll be there for the baby
but I can't live with you.

692
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,712
I don't love you.

693
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,994
I see...

694
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,159
Don't drink.
-Don't talk to me.

695
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,158
Did you have fun with Ari?

696
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,116
Go home if you can't behave.
-Slut!

697
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:07,399
You don't know
what you've done!

698
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,752
I know what you've been
doing behind my back!

699
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:24,992
Knock knock.
-Who's there?

700
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,992
Oh, it's postman Petskin.

701
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,159
I brought you something.

702
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,829
Why are we here?

703
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,953
Stop shooting, will you?

704
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,475
Stig...

705
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,834
Give me the gun.

706
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,913
Fuck, let's drink
to Ari the hero!

707
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,353
To the best man who
fucked the bride yesterday.

708
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,029
And our sacred priest -

709
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,115
who fucked my man!

710
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,039
A preaching whore!

711
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,909
Aren't you ashamed?

712
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,591
Stop!

713
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,792
What?
-Stop.

714
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,989
Sometimes you have
to go far to see clearly.

715
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,198
Take some distance.

716
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,233
Every thing's still unclear,
but in a different way.

717
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,435
People fear death.
They don't want to face it alone.

718
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,155
But we are still alone.

719
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:36,148
It's just nicer
to be alone together.

720
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,118
Let's drink some water.

721
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,515
Any questions?

722
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,600
How high is the church?

723
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,680
Can any one guess?
-Me!

724
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,956
130 meters.
-No.

725
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:13,314
500 meters.
-Look carefully!

726
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,153
Come on, let's play.
-Are you sure?

727
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,073
Yeah.
-Go on, play.

728
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,475
Good morning.

729
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:39,157
We'll continue
with yesterday's theme -

730
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,155
the importance of the sagas
in archeology.

731
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,437
