No, l don't think so.

1250
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,744
You gonna work on that baseball swing?

1251
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,914
Leave the baseball player alone.
He doesn't play basketball anymore.

1252
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,250
He probably doesn't even
have it anymore, guys.

1253
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,210
Michael, do you hear them?

1254
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:57,213
They don't think
you can play the game anymore.

1255
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,510
There's only one way to find out.

1256
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:10,268
ANNOUNCER:
The Chicago Bulls welcome back...

1257
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:15,523
...Michael Jordan!

1258
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:29,287
What's the matter, Bill?

1259
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,583
Larry, that could have been me.

1260
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:38,630
Will you get off that kick?
lt's over. lt's done with. You can't play.

1261
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,134
Okay.

1262
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,429
Let's go, Bulls.

1263
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,055
# R. Kelly - I Believe I Can Fly

1264
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:12,187
# I used to think that I could not go on

1265
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:20,028
# And life was nothing but an awful song

1266
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:27,953
# But now I know the meaning of true love

1267
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:36,170
# I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

1268
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:44,011
# If I can see it, then I can do it

1269
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:51,727
# If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

1270
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:55,731
# I believe I can fly

1271
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:59,651
# I believe I can touch the sky

1272
01:20:59,776 --> 01:21:03,780
# I think about it every night and day

1273
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:07,701
# Spread my wings and fly away

1274
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:11,705
# I believe I can soar

1275
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:16,001
# I see me running through that open door

1276
01:21:16,126 --> 01:21:19,463
# I believe I can fly

1277
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:23,467
# I believe I can fly

1278
01:21:23,675 --> 01:21:27,513
# I believe I can fly

1279
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,627
Well, that's all, folks.

1280
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,005
That's my line.

1281
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:02,300
Step aside, babe. Let a star do this.

1282
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,968
That's all--

1283
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,637
That's all, folks.

1284
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,807
Can l go home now?

1285
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,690
