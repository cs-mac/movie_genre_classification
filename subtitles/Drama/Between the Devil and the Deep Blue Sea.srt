<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i>

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,470
Sir, last night in many villages along the west coast, they say there was a strange occurrence.

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,410
The clothes that were hung in the backyards, and shoes disappeared.

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,680
In their place, they say a rare quality pearl was left.

6
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,260
A pearl?

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,830
Oh My!

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,680
How can there be a burglar who takes only a few clothes and leave such a thing as a pearl behind?

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,050
If only the burglar also decided to stop by here...

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,420
Look here, Hong Nan half your dresser is pearls and precious treasures of gold and silver

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,250
I apologize that this concubine is overflowing with materialistic greed.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,400
Since I am not able to completely have my spouse to myself, just think that I am compensating for that emptiness with material goods.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,710
What I mean Hong Nan is

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm saying that I will fill that other half of your dresser with jewels.

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,370
How long would that take...

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,920
Even though I'm busy as you can see, do you know why I'm on fire trying to catch a mermaid?

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,030
If I catch a mermaid, I can beat her and extract her tears again, and again

18
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,340
so that underneath each step you take can be adorned lavishly with pearls.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,530
That's my plan.

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,630
And you have a way to catch one?

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,800
Method or not, that one will come back on her own.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,090
Don't you think so Caretaker Jeon?

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,730
That's right. From the old times, the mermaid would come up to the village

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,300
and wear the clothes or eat food, they were sure to pay it back;

25
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,360
with rare pearls that can only be found outside the city.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,430
So are you saying that the clothing thief was a mermaid?

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,600
Are you saying a mermaid came up to this village?

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,610
<i>The mermaid who has fallen for the human must not go back.</i>

29
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,370
That is part of their inherent nature.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,600
For a mermaid that can only love once in her lifetime

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,360
She stakes her life on that one love.

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
For the mermaid, her one true love has appeared

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,650
and for me the lone opportunity has presented itself.

34
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,820
Let's do it like this, Caretaker Jeon.

35
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,420
Put out people to catch the mermaid before the village head does

36
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,440
Hong Nan you do your best to make sure a vicious rumor is circulated as swift as possible.

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,250
By vicious rumor you mean...?

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,910
The vicious rumor should be that recently a huge storm has caused the fishing boats to go missing

39
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,390
is all because of that bad omen, a mermaid.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,410
When the mermaid was washed ashore and caught, since all of that happened

41
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,570
it really does seem to be true.

42
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,620
This kid's smart.

43
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,400
But that ominous mermaid

44
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,690
with malicious intent selfishly hid herself deep inside the village while taking human form.

45
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,540
But if we are unable to stop her, an even bigger calamity would unfold

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,470
many people will be injured and die.

47
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:03,220
In five days time

48
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,150
They'll be brimming with concern over the wind and waves

49
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,850
there's no better timing than this!

50
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,530
There's nothing better than fear to stop the people's thoughts.

51
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,880
The village head also cannot help but deal with the scared witless villagers.

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
Of course, sir.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,580
If we're good, we can also force the village head into a deadly situation along with the mermaid.

54
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,800
Naive love is giving me great joy.

55
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,580
Aigoo the mermaid that was caught yesterday

56
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,480
has been seen again, have you heard?

57
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,520
They say that storm was caused by the mermaid!

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,110
Aigoo what can be done. With the strong winds, isn't my husband going to return as a sea monster if he rides out in his boat?<br>(<i>will be dead at sea, becoming a ghost haunting the ocean</i>)

59
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,520
- Then we need to immediately capture and kill that witch!<br> - Exactly!

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,680
What's the village head doing?!

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,410
Village Head! They say the mermaid has come up to the village!

62
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,540
Everyone is about to die!

63
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm saying you can't come here and be like this!

64
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,170
I got the message so please go back!

65
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,120
Look, have you finally lost your mind?

66
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,720
Didn't you just receive report on what kind of strange rumors are circulating within the administrative district.

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,820
But what? Who're you going to find?

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,850
I think Se Hwa came to see me. I had requested it last time.

69
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,110
I asked her to come see me at the 20th solar division (lays between the first day of winter and the first big snow, around the 22nd of November)

70
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,830
and that I want to be able to see the first snow with her.

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,110
I mean...look here. For someone who's educated why are you being like this!

72
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,640
The subdivisions in the year are just that.

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,160
Just because it is November 22th it doesn't mean that the snow will be like falling--

74
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,330
Dam Ryeong! Dam Ryeong!

75
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,930
You can 't!

76
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,570
If that woman really won't be able to go back, that means she risked her life.

77
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,700
The same goes for me. What am I not able to stake at this point?

78
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,860
Think of your family! Think of your father's honor and position!

79
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,940
In Shin An (county)'s Docho Island, Yeosu's Geomoon Island, Incheon's Jeongmoon

80
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,890
the places where the mermaids frequent, tell the elders, there is but one answer:

81
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,450
The biggest weakness of the mermaid who can't go back

82
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,660
are her legs. After her legs are severely wounded

83
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,430
<i>Legend of the Blue Sea</i>

84
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,580
The whereabouts of Ma Dae Young who was jailed in the Seoul Correctional Facility for murder charges, is

85
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,590
unknown for the last three months. Unlike the initial prediction by the police that he'll soon be apprehended

86
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,260
there isn't any headway in the investigation elevating the fears of the citizens.

87
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,340
Police have not ruled out the chance that Mr. Ma might have an accomplice in his escape, and are continuing the investigation.

88
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,230
To find out the underlying motivation behind his jailbreak, police

89
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,130
are deeply investigating Mr. Ma's personal relations and those who are against him. <br> - That crazy bastard.

90
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,050
Yes, Ahjumma. You also packed the crabs in soy sauce, right?

91
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,440
Oh my. What happens if I bring this as is and the sauce would leak all over?

92
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,160
I already told you before, time and again.

93
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,110
If I ask to have food for take out, you should pay special attention to it.

94
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,090
Look here, you see the clasps? I locked them shut so

95
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,520
be sure to hold it upright properly.

96
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,470
I should have it stand like this?

97
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,510
Don't put it on the trunk

98
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,810
but place it on the floor in the car and be sure to secure it well.

99
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,130
On the car's floor? Securely?

100
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,420
You should be careful when you carry it.

101
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,230
Okay.

102
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,060
But who's whose superior?

103
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh my! So funny. I'm speechless.

104
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,300
Yes, Madam. It's me, Jin Joo.

105
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,170
It's just that I have some side dishes that I think would match your taste and thought of you.

106
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,230
Yes, please taste it.

107
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,660
Wow, Mother. There's so many delicious things today.

108
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,840
Jin Joo gave it to us, saying it was made at her house.

109
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,880
Your sister's working real hard to make things work with our Chi Hyeon.

110
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Is that so? If those who it concerns are fine then, well then that's that.

111
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,900
No, Father. I'm fine with everything if my parents like it.

112
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,630
Honey, our Chi Hyeon is like this. Others say he's a Papa's boy.

113
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,930
It's not good to be that too much.

114
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,460
Why?

115
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,440
<i>-How is it?<br>-Don't make me speak.</i>

116
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,560
<i>-It's too delicious.<br>-Right?</i>

117
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,290
<i>Is it good, Heo Joon Jae?</i>

118
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,380
<i>Don't make me speak. It's too delicious.</i>

119
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,740
<i>Aigoo, we gave you the name 'Joon Jae' for you to become 'a brilliant man.'</i>

120
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,590
<i>But in order for our son to be a brilliant man, don't you have to be a conglomerate first, honey?</i>

121
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,470
<i>-When are you going to become a conglomerate?<br>-Wait just a little bit. Just a little bit.</i>

122
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,140
<i>I'm going to make you a Madam and you'll be wearing luxury goods from head to toe.</i>

123
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,030
<i>See if you don't! </i>

124
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,050
<i>Here, eat the meaty part.</i>

125
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,580
Why, honey? Does it not match your tastes?

126
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,460
No, it's really good. You try it too.

127
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,790
-Chi Hyeon.<br>-Yes, Father?<br>-You try it too.

128
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,130
Ah, no father. I have a shellfish allergy.

129
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,780
Honey, eat up! I heard Jin Joo had a new domestic help

130
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,840
they must have picked someone good now.

131
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,640
Honey...?

132
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,090
General Manager Nam

133
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,430
Yes?

134
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,100
Perhaps... do you keep in touch with Joon Jae these days?

135
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Today, it's your son's birthday so must have thought about him.

136
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,260
I have came to conclude that until this summer he lived near Samsung-dong.

137
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,470
But it seems he has moved out again.

138
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,880
It's hard to find out his address.

139
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,230
Wonder what he's been doing... that pathetic punk.

140
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,260
Now, you should make up.

141
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,980
Make what up? Between a father and a son.

142
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,590
I'm saying it because it's you. But the only blood relative I have is Joon Jae.

143
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,300
<i>Now I need to find him and have him beside me. I have a lot to teach him.</i>

144
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,890
<i>Can you get him?</i>

145
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,670
It's me.

146
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,240
<i>It's his birthday today.</i>

147
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,530
<i>He'll appear there.</i>

148
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,190
<i>Find out where he is. When you find out,</i>

149
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,110
<i>make him disappear.</i>

150
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,490
Do you know me?

151
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,580
I'll ask again.

152
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,280
Do you know me?

153
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,510
Hey, over there! Please hold onto her. Why is she so fast?

154
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,920
Aigoo. Thank you. She's someone who went into our facilities without our permission.

155
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,560
We need to investigate her.

156
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,090
- I know.<br> - Pardon?

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,790
I am Detective Hong Dok Kyeong from the Myeongdong Violent Crimes Department. I received a report.

158
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,930
Already? Who reported her?

159
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,580
- I didn't.<br>- Maybe the security team reported it.

160
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,860
- Are you the one in charge?<br> - Oh yes I am

161
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,270
Breaking and entering tends to have a purpose and it seems like it would be very difficult without inside help.

162
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,000
Later, I might need to investigate witnesses. When that time comes I will call you.

163
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,510
Ah, yes. I understand.

164
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,590
We need to go together.

165
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,610
She's someone who's getting apprehended right?

166
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,660
I didn't get you out to save you.

167
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,600
There's something I need to know. So give me an answer.

168
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,670
This. Why were we together?

169
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,870
Why am I in here with Heo Joon Jae?

170
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,700
You know my name, too?

171
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,040
You know me, right?

172
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,990
You don't know?

173
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,970
You do know or you don't know?

174
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,860
You know me. You know my name too.

175
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,710
It's true that we were in Spain together.

176
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,100
But why do I not know you? Who are you?

177
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,710
Who are you?

178
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,390
Okay.

179
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,490
What's your name?

180
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,040
I don't have a name.

181
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,450
-You don't have a name?<br>-Nope.

182
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,660
I don't have a name, but I was told I'm not a strange person.

183
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,770
-By who?<br>-A good person.

184
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm not sure what kind of person he/she was, but there's a high chance they're pretty strange too.

185
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,730
Your words and actions...everything is strange, you know?

186
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,080
Do you not speak Korean well? Are you an overseas Korean?

187
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,650
I'm going to ask you for the last time.

188
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,650
What happened between us in Spain?

189
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm pretty sure I met you, but why don't I remember anything?

190
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,060
Was there an accident that happened that I don't know about?

191
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,230
You don't have anything to say to me, right?

192
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,610
There's a lot that curious about you, but you don't have anything to say to me...

193
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,460
So isn't it useless to keep being together?

194
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,340
Why? You have something to say to me?

195
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,140
Then don't follow me.

I'm not someone who's preaching the Tao or anything.

What do you see?

204
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,290
Miss you don't have any luck with your ancestors

205
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,780
but your nose is blocking a lot of bad energy. But then...

206
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,530
It's ambiguous. No matter how nice your nose is, the lack of ancestoral blessings is stronger.

207
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,840
In the ground, your ancestors are crying.

208

The people who made you, the people who made them, the people who made them are those people.

211
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,490
Your roots! Your origin.

212
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,120
They wouldn't be in the ground.

213
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,200
If it's not in the ground, wh..wh..where?

215
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,710
Ah! They weren't buried.

216
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,690
So you spread their ashes over the river or sea, I see.

217
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,150
Well, wherever it is...

218
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,040
It's important that your ancestors are crying.

219
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,150
- Why are they crying?<br>- What do you mean "why"?

220
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,570
It's because their descendants aren't doing their duty (<i>gong</i>)

221
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,970

This 'gong', okay? With this 'gong,'

if you read it backwards, what does it become?

225
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,140
You know how the word 'nim' (님, means loved one) turns into 'nam' (남, stranger) if you put a dot in it?

226
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,360
It's the same concept! Look.

227
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,450

That's right! It's 'fortune!' That's right!

233
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,200
What does this mean? If you do your duty, then 'fortune' will also follow.

234
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,530
Wow! This truth is so scientific,

235
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,440

Excuse me, if you go to the parking lot

239
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,680
our minivan is there on standby. Why don't you go there.

Why? What? Who are you?

Me? Your ancestor.

242
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:25,360
I thought that if I continue to neglect my descendant, I thought the whole world will turn into a shitshow that

243
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
so I came here personally to get you. To take you away.

Aish, this jerk! Are you a pick-pocket!

247
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,930
I'm going to report you immediately. I'm going to report you!

248

Please, give it to me, sir.

250

If you give it to me right now, I'l leave quietly.

251
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,630
It's because I can't have my identity leaked.

Ah, it's really cold.

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,100
<i>-Of course!<br>-It's for real.</i>

309
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,990
<i>-Yeah!</i>

310
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,090
But why do you keep speaking informally?

311
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,150
I'm going to speak informally now too then.

312
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,070
Should we watch golf?

313
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,640
Wait a minute...

314
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,660
No, Ahjumm...

315
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:33,210
...until 9:30 pm, vehicular traffic will be prohibited. Activities near the enclosed area will go into the late night

316
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,590
Nevermind. You can watch golf now.

317
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,790
Thank you.

318
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,790
What "thank you"?

319
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,220
This is our TV; this is our house.

320
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,650
Why are you following the Ahjumma's words exactly?

321
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,910
I don't know. Weirdly, every time she orders something, I do it.

322
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,040
Yeah.

323
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,290
I'm following him right now,

324
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,580
but he's with some girl.

325
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,400
But how did you know he would be here today?

326
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,770
He did that since he was young.

327
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:19,180
Even after growing up, he hasn't fixed his habit.

328
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,670
<i>Joon Jae, where are you going?</i>

329
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,560
<i> My mom and I planned to meet each other on my birthday.</i>

330
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,150
<i>Mom will be waiting.</i>

331
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,050
<i>Let go. Let go!</i>

332
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,790
<i>Is that so? Then go.</i>

333
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,980
<i>Your mom won't be there.</i>

334
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,200
<i>Because your father gave her a lot of money.</i>

335
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,230
<i>But if she meets you, she has to return all of that money.</i>

336
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,450
<i>Why do you think your mother left you without a word?</i>

337
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,780
<i>It's because she likes the money way more than she likes you.</i>

338
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,660
<i>No! No, my mom isn't like that.</i>

339
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,310
<i>My mom isn't like that!</i>

340
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,910
<i>What's with him now?</i>

341
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,410
<i>He said he's meeting his mother.</i>

342
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,870
<i>This bast***.</i>

343
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,680
<i>Go into your room!</i>

344
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,850
<i>Why are you shouting at him when it's over something sad?!</i>

345
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,260
<i>No, no, my mom...</i>

346
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,130
<i>My mom will come to see me.</i>

347
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,480
<i>Joon Jae, don't cry. Your step-mother will be sad too.</i>

348
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,900
<i>Joon Jae, I'm sorry.</i>

349
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,820
Do you know how much effort I've put into this hous

350
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,450
Now that it's time to clarify the inheritors, he looks for his son?

351
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,330
<i>Be sure to find out where he lives today.</i>

352
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,030
Okay?

353
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,310
I need to live for you to live.

354
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,980
Hang up. He's moving.

355
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,850
Why do you keep following me? I need to go.

356
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,220
What do you want me to do?

357
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,540
Can't I go with you?

358
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,960
Together? Where? My house?

359
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,460
No.

360
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,870
Why?

361
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,800
Of course you can't. How could a woman go to a man's house?

362
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,750
If your parents knew, what would they say?

363
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,240
I don't have any parents.

364
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,960
Then answer me. We know each other, right? Something happened, right?

365
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,300
See.

366
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,160
It's because you're like this, on what basis do I bring you home?

367
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,450
Give me your hand.

368
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,540
If you have something to say to me later, then contact me then.

369
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,560
I don't know.

370
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,660
I don't know her. What am I supposed to do?

371
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,860
I like it that I'm in Seoul.

372
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,330
<i>You really don't know Seoul?</i>

373
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,740
I'm sure.

374
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,910
It's cold. I'm closing the window.

375
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,340
I like it that I'm with you.

376
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,610
<i>I love you.</i>

377
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,900
Hey, I'm trying to compare something.

378
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,340
Say it to me.

379
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,850
Huh? What?

380
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,780
That. That "I lo..."

381
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,010
Nevermind. Do it later.

382
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,980
Ah, who's this guy now.

383
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,060
Are you still looking at that?

384
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,520
Oh right.

385
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,130
Have you seen a drawing such as this?

386
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,950
There's none.

387
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,030
How could a person from the Joseon Dynasty draw something like this?

388
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:35,720
The Professor said, it might have been that the painter rode a time machine and saw the future.

389
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,330
Somehow...

390
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,800
Feels very similar to someone I know.

391
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,120
Who?

392
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,100
There's someone. It's his birthday.

393
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,180
Come inside.

394
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,710
Hey! How can you bring her here? Are you crazy?

395
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,460
Did she hear?

396
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,560
Is there nothing to eat in here?

397
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,000
Why would something to eat be in there? Come over here.

398
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,910
Hey, miss, where is your house?

399
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,580
It's far.

400
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,020
Mine's far too. It's in Namyangju.

401
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,010
Mine's rea...

402
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,720
...lly far.

403
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,590
She doesn't match with me. Joon Jae, she doesn't match with me.

404
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,380
What would you do if she did match? Is someone giving a blind date for you?

405
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,600
But even so, we'll be living together.

406
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,150
"Living together" my butt.

407
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,900
You are also mooching of right now. You guys should leave now.

408
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,800
Oh my. This guy is so vicious.

409
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,200
If Tae Oh and I leave together, what are you guys going to do in one house together?

410
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,380
Ah, would I keep this girl with me?

411
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,750
I brought her because there's something I have to check.

412
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,560
What are you checking? Hey, don't take it out! Don't take it out!

413
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,110
You...know about this, right?

414
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,780
You know about it, right?

415
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,670
-Yeah. <br>-Is it yours?

416
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,420
I gave it to you.

417
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:34,570
You gave this to me?

418
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,360
Yeah. Because you liked it.

419
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,410
Yeah, he probably did like it.

420
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,810
But it isn't an object that can be given just because he liked it.

421
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,630
Oh, you're really kind. It's sad to take it.

422
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,460
There's a lot of things like this in my house.

423
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,490
You have a lot?

424
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,260
Yeah, if you just search around, there's a lot.

425
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,760
Is that so? There's a lot if you search around.

426
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,910
Joon Jae. Lets let her stay at our house for a moment.

427
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,510
Look at you talking about her staying here.

428
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,330
Why? She said she doesn't know anyone in Seoul. But do you really have a lot of this stuff at home?

429
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,280
Yeah.

430
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,430
We...No, this oppa will help you with this harsh life in Seoul.

431
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,940
Instead, you can't forget that I helped you.

432
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,710
If you want to give thanks when you return home, you can do that too.

433
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,730
I know the bracelet but, you, who gave the bracelet to me; I do not know?

434
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,660
Do you think that makes sense?

435
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:53,570
See? She talks so well but when an important topic comes up she won't speak!

436
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,270
Hey, don't be too harsh. There must be a situation.

437
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,470
But what's your name?

438
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,400
She doesn't have one.

439
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,320
She...she doesn't have one?

440
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,970
-Why do people keep asking whether I have a name? <br>-That's an interesting question.

441
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:12,200
People ask because they need to call you with a name.

442
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,440
They can't call me if I don't have a name?

443
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,150
It'll be hard. It's easier to call people with a name.

444
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:24,430
If I have a name, will you call for me?

445
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,640
-I guess I will if I have to. <br>-Then make me a name.

446
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,470
-Make what? Do you think I would do that? <br>-Give me a name!

447
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,720
A name comes from the feeling when you look at that person.

448
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,750
The image of that person. When I look at you, I think of Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn.

449
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,210
If you watch the movie, the princess would roam around not knowing anything.

450
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,240
Shall I say I could feel such vibe?

451
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,950
What about that name? Oh Deu Ree (sounds like Audrey.) Last name Oh. First name Deu Ree.

452
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,560
Just... Shim Cheong Yi.

453
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,530
She's extremely dumb. So Shim Cheong Yi is just right.

454
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,800
How could you be so insincere towards a person?

455
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,030
I like it.

456
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,980
What are you saying? He's teasing you that you're stupid!

457
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,280
I like that name. Shim Cheong Yi. I like it.

458
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,590
It fits her. You have a knack for naming.

459
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,480
What's your name?

460
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,810
I'm Tae Oh.

461
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,140
I'm Shim Cheong Yi.

462
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,980
But still, it's your birthday so I thought you should have a cake.

463
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,670
On my way home...

464
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,330
You had a guest! Who is she?

465
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,710
Ah...

466
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,110
Hello. I'm Shim Cheong Yi.

467
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,310
I see...

468
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,220
AH THAT SCARED ME!

469
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,320
Why are you like this? Get off of me!

470
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,590
Get off!

471
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,640
Hey, hey, hey!

472
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,480
You eat this after you blow out the candles.

473
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,080
Lets sing the happy birthday song!

474
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,560
Happy birthday to you-

475
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,030
Eat it after taking out the candles. Here.

476
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,360
Ah!

477
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,240
Oh my god.

478
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,130
Noone will steal it from you. Eat it slowly.

479
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,930
Joon Jae. Have some too.

480
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,190
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

481
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,090
Hey. Eat it from her. She must feel embarrassed.

482
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,850
Seriously.

483
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:12,230
Oh right. Joon Jae, you will go on Professor Jin's retirement party next week, right?

484
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:15,950
I will be meeting with him tomorrow separately. I also have something to talk to him about.

485
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,300
Professor Jin was so disappointed when ever he started a new project.

486
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,350
He's saying how it would have been nice if you were there to help.

487
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,990
So, she will be here for the mean time?

488
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:38,980
I stopped him too. I did.

489
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,420
But Joon Jae is weak against justice. She also seems mentally unstable and all.

490
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,830
Why are you being so bothered about that girl who doesn't even know her own name.

491
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,320
I don't know.

492
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,530
You should hold still and not leave this house.

493
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:02,350
No.

494
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,950
There's no room so where is she going to sleep?

495
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,400
Honestly, there is another room.

496
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,290
Come up.

497
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,870
Do I live here?

498
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,010
Get your senses together. What do you mean "live"?

499
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,850
I have something to find out that's why I'm letting you stay for a while.

500
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,230
It's only for a few days.

501
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,370
Aigoo.

502
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,270
Thank you, Heo Joon Jae.

503
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,720
Of course you should be thankful.

504
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,900
Let's now live quietly.

505
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,090
Hey! I can hear everything!

506
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:39,500
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Blue Sea @ Viki</i>

507
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,990
Heo Joon Jae! It's morning. Let's eat breakfast!

508
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,930
Ahw!

509
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,560
The delicious meal is cooking.

510
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,700
Right, start. It would be better if you would hurry.

511
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,670
You're doing all sorts of things.

512
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,400
Wow! It's nice how this feels like a home.

513
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:14,960
Hey, where did all the milk go?

514
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,370
There's one person who drank it in one shot saying she's hungry while waiting for the food.

515
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,150
It's not like I can always say what is right.

516
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,400
Is anyone in there?

517
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,570
Is there anyone home?

518
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,130
Is there anyone home?

519
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,160
I don't! Just because of this, you woke up a sleeping person?

520
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,770
Hey! What are you doing?

521
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,950
I saw you! What are you doing?

522
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:43,500
You are a thief, right? Don't you move.

523
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,550
This bastard.

524
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,920
What are you doing, you crazy bastard?

525
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,740
Thank you.

526
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,000
What is it?

527
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,960
Why did I go there?

528
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,880
We were apart and I hurt my head.

529
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,830
Certainly.

530
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,400
What is it, seriously?

531
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,150
Yes, Hyung?

532
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,590
Joon Jae, stop. Stop.

533
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,400
- What?<br>- Look up front.

534
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,950
Hey.

535
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,750
What is it? What happened?

536
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,260
The one living next door, what on earth. There's a murder case.

537
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,740
- What?<br>- I also called Tae Ho telling him not to come home.

538
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,020
Hurry and turn the car around. Detective Hong is out there.

539
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:32,950
Detective Hong, who is so bent on catching you. He also saw your face three years ago.

540
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,900
What are you doing? I said turn the car around.

541
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,990
Cheong Yi is alone at home.

542
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,860
What matters if she's alone for a while.

543
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,500
If you will keep on staying here then they will be suspicious.

544
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,140
What's wrong? It's not even on your district.

545
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:01,380
I heard the weapon used was a hammer. It's definitely Mah Dae Young.

546
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:07,680
Is it only Mah Dae Young who uses a hammer to murder? The victim was a loan shark so it's 100% obviously a revenge.

547
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,950
Where do you find a 100% on a case? First, let's look at the possibility. If it's not then I'll step out if it isn't.

548
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,250
Why isn't Heo Joon Jae coming?

549
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,440
<i>Hey! You shouldn't have appeared in front of me!</i>

550
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:55,800
<i>You should have lived without knowing!</i>

551
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,080
<i>Let me tell you a secret.</i>

552
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,950
<i>Your father is...</i>

553
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,980
What's wrong? Move.

554
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,200
Speak. Is she dead?

555
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,390
Is it Heo Joon Jae?

556
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:33,390
<i>Listen carefully. Protecting someone else is after protecting yourself. That's how the order is.</i>

557
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:38,770
<i>Changing that order is being stupid. Do you understand?</i>

558
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:58,560
Hyung, move.

559
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,010
Huh?

560
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,750
If you don't want to be stupid then move.

561
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:06,610
What did you say? Hey! Joon Jae! Heo Joon Jae!

562
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,440

<i>Well...</i>

571

<i>Should I do it?</i>

572
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,450
<i>No, Madam. I should do it.</i>

<i>What?</i>

579
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,220
<i>The jar's cover.</i>

580
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,220
<i>I just... opened them.</i>

581
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,240
<i>Should I do it?</i>

582
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,820
<i>Madam! I will close all the covers.</i>

583
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,830
<i>No. You have something else to do.</i>

584
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,550
<i>That punk, no matter how long I wait, there's no reply.</i>

<i>Go and hand my letter and personally get a reply.</i>

<i>Madam, I think she knows that's why she's doing it, to tear us apart.</i>
