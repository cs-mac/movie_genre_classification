00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:36,223
<B> Lascivia </ b>

2
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:39,047
<B> As you arrive, you leave, </ b>

3
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:42,929
<B> No time to nest </ b>

4
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,599
<B> we must continue. </ B>

5
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,382
<B> I feel that </ b>

6
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,330
<B> who knows when, </ b>

7
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,361
<B> come and see me </ b>

8
00:00:56,362 --> 00:01:00,428
<B> again. </ B>

9
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:04,988
A special welcome to
all of you tonight,

10
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,917
I hope that those who
are far from home

11
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,909
Do not feel too sad.

12
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,971
If there is anything I can do,

13
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,106
I will do it.

14
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,102
I have another piece of
sausage, do you like it?

15
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:37,154
Oh, yes, thank you.
Just a little bit.

16
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:41,248
I still can not believe I'm
sitting so close to you.

17
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:45,007
Really, all my friends
adore his style.

18
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,013
Do you know why they arrested you?

19
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:52,167
I think it was because
of my boyfriend,

20
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,407
Is in the resistance.

21
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:54,623
Oh.

22
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,661
I adore him,

23
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:58,792
His name is Maurice.

24
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:01,543
Is in the second year
of dental school.

25
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:04,549
Mine are here,

26
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,904
With relatives.

27
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:09,429
Oh, France, it's beautiful.

28
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,231
I love France.

29
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:17,470
Mme. Fénelon his music
is the soul of Paris.

30
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,417
Yes. Yes.

31
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,438
Thank you.

32
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,795
Someone said we will have to
pretend joy when they take us out.

33
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:30,838
Are you?

34
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,572
Where?

35
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,092
You have to.

36
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,717
I never meant anything to me.

37
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:36,093
about me.

38
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,233
You really should not eat so much.

39
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:50,888
Oh, I can not help it.

40
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,519
I never did until
I got arrested.

41
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:54,644
Since then I have been
hungry all the time.

42
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,665
Can you tell the address?

43
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,509
It's to the north.

44
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,136
Some think it will be Munich,
perhaps as workers on the farms.

45
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,405
Munich?

46
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,582
I'm not sure I can
work on a farm, might?

47
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,848
Have you lived in the country?

48
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:24,141
No, no, never. She was a student
in my house, my whole life.

49
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,992
He would care, sir.

50
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,144
Change?

51
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,216
He turned east.

52
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,539
To the East?

53
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,089
That can not be right, some
of us know this, Janet.

54
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,988
He cares if we can
stay together.

55
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,041
How old are you?

56
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:18,491
Twenty.

57
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:19,958
For real?

58
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,491
If you're so young.

59
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:42,122
I have to find the shithead.

60
00:06:58,214 --> 00:06:59,714
Why do not you watch what you do?

61
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,523
Come with me.

62
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:02,432
It's changed.

63
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,755
I almost fainted.

64
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,123
I have to get to the shithead.

65
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,330
Outrageous.

66
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,616
Thank you.

67
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:12,811
Thank you.

68
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:29,679
Quiet.

69
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,130
No one is watching.

70
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,025
It was not your fault.

71
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:15,535
Mrs., Mrs., your husband.

72
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,711
Open the door!

73
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:31,223
There's a dead man in here.

74
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:32,142
Open the door!

75
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,203
Come, this is where our things
will be returned to us.

76
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:14,565
What did you say?

77
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,459
What if this is where our
things will be returned to us?

78
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,419
Take off your coat.

79
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,324
Take off your clothes.

80
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,589
Take off your clothes!

81
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:51,249
She can keep her hair.

82
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,175
Only shave the Jews.

83
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,563
Look how I look, you Jewish rat.

84
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,932
I'm not a Jewish
rat, I'm French.

85
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,138
For talking!

86
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,244
Where are the people
with whom we came,

87
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,126
The ones on the
Red Cross trucks?

88
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,398
Look...

89
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:50,523
The "cook".

90
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:06,111
Mariane, listen to me.

91
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,673
You have to be careful.

92
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:12,429
Why did they do that?

93
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,671
What do they get?

94
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,655
What is the purpose?

95
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:31,088
Neither boyfriend would allow me to enter the
resistance because it was too dangerous.

96
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:42,103
Is that why you did not?

97
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,800
I have been in resistance
for a long time.

98
00:15:17,469 --> 00:15:19,739
There's a dead woman here.

99
00:15:29,454 --> 00:15:30,954
The best at night

100
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,372
When we are alone,

101
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:34,218
Is to remember everything.

102
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,184
You have to take care of this.

103
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,250
There was once a prince,

104
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,912
Called John,

105
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,936
And was terribly vain.

106
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:51,009
And he married Princess Couchonet,

107
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,509
Which was very beautiful.

108
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,669
So one day, the prince sent

109
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,699
For her, because she wanted children.

110
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,746
So...

111
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,329
so

112
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:10,171
They had six children
and five daughters...

113
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:14,790
And every son had a horse,

114
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,911
And every daughter had a cow.

115
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:22,810
And when they grew up...

116
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:28,408
They always took care of each other.

117
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,891
Does anyone know how to sing Madama Butterfly?

118
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:21,230
Does anyone know how to
sing Madama Butterfly?

119
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:32,278
She... she can.

120
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,462
Bring it.

121
00:19:32,008 --> 00:19:34,976
I'm Ethanine, I saw her once
in Paris at the Melodie,

122
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,724
My parents took me for
my 17th birthday.

123
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:40,400
I myself have started to play
professionally this year.

124
00:19:40,401 --> 00:19:43,036
She was the one who
recognized it, it's Michou.

125
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:45,716
Yesterday I thought I saw
her coming out of her tent.

126
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,779
I begged our custodian
to give him an audition.

127
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,488
For whom is this?

128
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,487
For the officers, for us.

129
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:55,520
Laura, Laura, come and meet Mme.
Fénelon.

130
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,975
She is one of our
best interpreters.

131
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:59,903
You can make Brahms solos.

132
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:05,285
It is an honor for me to meet you.

133
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,805
Is there a Director?

134
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,415
Oh yeah, Mme. Alma Rosé.

135
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,163
His uncle was Gustav Mahler,
the great composer.

136
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:18,000
He is a fantastic talent, - but
not a warm heart, take care.

137
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,680
Are you Mlle. Fénelon?

138
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,461
Yes madam

139
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:42,137
Plays the piano?

140
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,774
Yes madam

141
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:47,905
Let me hear something
about Madama Butterfly.

142
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:11,429
Will he take it?

143
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,311
Yes, lady, her tones
are very good.

144
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:15,976
It's marvelous.

145
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,738
Do you know any German music?

146
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:26,502
Yes.

147
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,410
I am the Lagerfuhrerin Maria Amanda,

148
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:43,596
Commander of all the
women in this camp.

149
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:45,247
I...

150
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,601
I forgot to tell Mme. Rosé that...

151
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:52,373
I...

152
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:55,394
I can not accept being
in the orchestra

153
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:57,835
Unless my friend

154
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:03,086
6W62 can also join
the orchestra.

155
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,800
It has a beautiful voice.

156
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,699
It's in tent B,

157
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,898
unless...

158
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,971
That she may enter,

159
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:16,531
I...

160
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:19,516
I must refuse, I'm sorry.

161
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:33,890
See that they are cleaned,
and sent to the warehouse.

162
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,861
Yes, Mrs. Lagerfuhrerin.

163
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,529
What size?

164
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:32,368
Number 9, Frau Lagerfuhrerin.
- Nine.

165
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,944
I want boots.

166
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,587
I'm afraid we do not have it.
- Find them!

167
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:47,568
It should be warm and comfortable
to take care of your voice.

168
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,252
Continue.

169
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:16,550
Sit down.

170
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,059
From the beginning.

171
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,813
Why so strident?

172
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:26,013
This is not band music,

173
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,630
We do not touch the wind.

174
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,412
Why can not they obey
my instructions?

175
00:29:38,914 --> 00:29:42,702
Music is the most sacred
activity of humanity,

176
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:48,393
Must be devoted day and night,

177
00:29:48,394 --> 00:29:50,484
You must listen to yourself,

178
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,085
Should be inspired to achieve some improvement.

179
00:29:55,427 --> 00:30:00,208
They can not just keep
repeating the same stupidity.

180
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:12,209
Rest, Philharmonic.

181
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,177
I think you altered it.

182
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,545
Well, it's been so good.

183
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,854
Who suddenly realized
how we really sounded.

184
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:22,250
Well, it was a big crash.

185
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,184
Do not know why we can
not learn that number?

186
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,203
We have to do it as
she indicates it.

187
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,432
And you, you're making them worse.

188
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:32,282
I've only studied music for
six months in my entire life.

189
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:35,047
Surely it was not the worst
6 months you've ever spent.

190
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:37,273
It's not just that we can not mate,

191
00:30:37,274 --> 00:30:39,533
But the teacher has also
gotten into this problem.

192
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:40,334
Why?

193
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:42,706
We were just a band of
marches when we started,

194
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,803
To touch the prisoners after
their work assignments

195
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:45,825
And allowed the band.

196
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,113
Our guards were excited.

197
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:50,995
Suddenly we found ourselves
playing Bach, Brahms,

198
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:53,313
Concerts for high metals.

199
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,403
He is a victim of his own pride,

200
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,784
And that's why we have problems now.
- Will they ever feed us?

201
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,972
The last soup will be
served at any time.

202
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:05,235
I do not want problems.

203
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:08,303
As soon as the big bosses
came and listened to us

204
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:10,890
They began to get bored of
hearing the same three numbers.

205
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:12,938
But we did not have any
other orchestration.

206
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,384
It's just that no composer ever wrote
anything for a group like this.

207
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:18,156
You happen to not make
instrumentations, do you?

208
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:21,091
We have performed the same concerts
so many times that the commanders...

209
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:23,566
Fania, you do not have to instrument,

210
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,994
But you're good at
all sorts of things.

211
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:30,783
I'll try, I think I can.

212
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:32,794
Yes

213
00:31:32,795 --> 00:31:35,327
Well, it will not be very professional.

214
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:37,871
We must tell Madame.

215
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:44,769
Yes.

216
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,845
We thought you would like to know

217
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,241
Which Fania knows how to implement.

218
00:31:55,242 --> 00:31:57,363
Leave us, leave us.

219
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,392
Tell me the truth Fania.

220
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,578
Yes, I can, I can
not see why not.

221
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:15,187
I must suppose that he
actually studied it.

222
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:18,608
Yes, in the conservatory of Paris.

223
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,804
Lucky!

224
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:23,836
How lucky for you to have Fania.

225
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:31,443
I've been under terrible pressure
to present something new.

226
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:33,393
That's what they told me.

227
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,250
You can start with...

228
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,941
I have a piano score
for "Carmen".

229
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:42,594
Good yes. I guess I
can do "Carmen".

230
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,606
Or something German,

231
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:46,357
For bone, that of the house.

232
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:52,510
I know,

233
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,897
But they have done
nothing but Von Suppé.

234
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:58,873
And we must try to please Fania.

235
00:33:01,174 --> 00:33:03,652
Well, I think that's elementary.

236
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,627
I'd rather believe that
I'm saving my life.

237
00:33:05,628 --> 00:33:08,124
Instead of trying to please S.S.

238
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,144
Do you think you can
do without the other?

239
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,897
Start immediately.

240
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,291
I will need some people
to copy the parts and

241
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,327
Some music paper.

242
00:33:21,328 --> 00:33:23,123
It is not possible to get music paper.

243
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,303
It may not require some.

244
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,366
There is a war going on my dear.

245
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:31,591
Come on, I'll find some paper,
you draw the lines themselves.

246
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:34,619
What did he say?

247
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,887
Fania...

248
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:43,629
I can not help but strive for
the pursuit of perfection,

249
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,748
I was trained that way and
I can not change now.

250
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:52,558
He is hardly in a position
to criticize her, and

251
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,285
I'm also trying to please her.

252
00:33:54,286 --> 00:33:55,443
Exactly,

253
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:57,612
But we are artists,

254
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,407
We can not get away from that.

255
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:03,609
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

256
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:08,623
Please try to speed up the work,

257
00:34:09,524 --> 00:34:11,928
You will see that they are
very temperamental with us.

258
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:14,716
Do it soon Fania.

259
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:17,890
Now.

260
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,762
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

261
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:16,215
with your permission

262
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:20,324
A little bit of popular
music with our new member.

263
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,154
Why do you bother
stealing when you know

264
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:02,744
I can not bear to see you eat so much?

265
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:04,577
I was just looking for a little taste.

266
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,409
I told you that you could take it.

267
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:10,912
You should think it's
good to be a little girl,

268
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:13,310
When are you going to take
care of that situation?

269
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,067
You can not keep expecting
something fantastic to happen.

270
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,269
You have to accept that
this is where you are,

271
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,331
And it is much better
than most prisons.

272
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:20,391
I will not do it any more.

273
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:24,202
Is there anyone else you're
doing these things for?

274
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:27,087
If that's what you
want, then we're done.

275
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,028
Is seriously.

276
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,530
You are welcome to take
everything I have,

277
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,398
I hope you do the same
for me if I'm desperate.

278
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,821
Fania very well that we can
share everything we have.

279
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,280
I have refused to become an
animal for a gram of "something"

280
00:37:40,315 --> 00:37:42,163
Or a piece of potato.

281
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:45,344
But will not you want to share
with the prebostes as well?

282
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:47,289
You can share with
those bitches, not me.

283
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,337
Well they are not all like that.

284
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:50,597
You, you also had a
pet, July, like Fania.

285
00:37:50,598 --> 00:37:53,608
But you are an anti-Semite.
- No, I'm not.

286
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:56,290
We had many Jewish
friends in the theater.

287
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,389
I am not.

288
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,399
In my opinion Etalina

289
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,039
The public thinks that
you are going to be...

290
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,683
Oh, can you tell? Darling
spells G A S E A D O S.

291
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:11,229
The point is they want to feel
superior because they probably

292
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,115
Will have to return to their homes
at the end of the war being pagans.

293
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:16,842
They are more stupid than ever.

294
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:18,846
Well, then we should
try to educate them.

295
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,195
Fania, Fania,

296
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:29,046
Tell us about Paris again,

297
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:30,189
You wore those skirts.

298
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,159
Very elegant, very current,
I always liked flowers.

299
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,898
They are also very tall,
legs are terrible.

300
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,611
You can not wear stockings
because your legs are marked.

301
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:42,412
My mother would not let me use them.

302
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:45,701
And her hair, there were women
in a convoy the other day,

303
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,409
I think of Holland,

304
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,403
With loops on top of hair.

305
00:38:49,404 --> 00:38:51,063
Oh yeah, rich girls,

306
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:52,345
All up.

307
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,438
Where are those women?

308
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,503
Oh, they must have burned them already.

309
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,223
And of songs, do you
know some new ones?

310
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:03,554
It's strong to say that.

311
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:04,850
Why not say it?

312
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:07,469
It is better to be prepared
for when our time comes.

313
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,962
Who sings any of the new songs?

314
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,981
Did you record any record in Paris?

315
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:56,893
Let's get up.

316
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,020
Fania.

317
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:08,094
You do not have to do that,
you're in the band now.

318
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,473
I would not want it to be seen
that it is not for prisoners.

319
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:03,616
I'm so hungry Fania.

320
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,408
What can I do?

321
00:43:07,409 --> 00:43:09,768
Try to think of something else.

322
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:12,008
Can not you ask Alma something?

323
00:43:12,009 --> 00:43:13,947
Do not be silly, because you
would give me something.

324
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:15,859
And what am I going to do?

325
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,934
We are all in the same problem.

326
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:18,872
Why do you expect
me to find food?

327
00:43:18,873 --> 00:43:20,024
I'm not a magician.

328
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,332
Is that all you've done?

329
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:54,156
At that rate we will wait a hundred
years for you to give us another score.

330
00:43:54,157 --> 00:43:56,464
You can stop annoying, instrument

331
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:59,160
It is a difficult job,
even for experts.

332
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:13,314
I have to talk to you.

333
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:23,308
Why do not you stop...?

334
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:26,072
Then you lied.

335
00:44:26,073 --> 00:44:27,304
You can not instrument.

336
00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:29,392
I'm very capable of doing
it, I'm sure I can.

337
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:31,906
What is it then?

338
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:35,411
One of the women...

339
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:37,021
this morning...

340
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:41,131
He spit on me

341
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:43,401
Yes?

342
00:44:47,682 --> 00:44:52,054
I had not realized how
much they should hate us.

343
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,016
Yes, of course,
what did he expect?

344
00:44:57,017 --> 00:44:58,496
Well, I...

345
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:03,919
I had not thought about it.

346
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:08,083
Perhaps you are too aware
of the orchestra's purpose.

347
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:09,661
No, no, I did not mean...

348
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:11,445
Do you want to go back to tent B?

349
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:12,817
Surely that can be fixed.

350
00:45:12,818 --> 00:45:15,403
Master, please, I'm
not criticizing you.

351
00:45:18,504 --> 00:45:22,317
It's just that I'm not used
to being hated this way.

352
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:27,269
Fania...

353
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,237
In this place there
is life or death.

354
00:45:31,238 --> 00:45:34,746
There is no possibility for
anything else, whatever.

355
00:45:39,247 --> 00:45:41,265
I'm trying to rehearse that piece tomorrow.

356
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:43,224
I want the parties early.

357
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,064
That, if you can.

358
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:48,464
You are?

359
00:45:50,866 --> 00:45:53,390
Yes yes I am.

360
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:44,076
Eat it.

361
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:49,747
You must go hungry
working all night.

362
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:58,538
Will not you eat it?

363
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:04,161
Who gave you the right
to judge anyone?

364
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:08,621
I'm just trying to keep myself alive,
just like everyone else, just like you.

365
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,642
Or you?

366
00:48:16,878 --> 00:48:18,914
You know what they think of us.

367
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:23,839
We are no better than the prostitutes
who entertain the murderers.

368
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,867
I know, I'm not judging you.

369
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:28,505
But if you do, I perceive it from you.

370
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,660
And you have no right.

371
00:48:34,362 --> 00:48:35,286
Eat it.

372
00:48:40,188 --> 00:48:42,232
Well, it does not matter.

373
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,768
Either way we'll live
until we get out of here.

374
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:46,871
What if we succeeded?

375
00:48:46,872 --> 00:48:49,268
What if we really live?

376
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:51,927
Everything that means
to me, my dear, is

377
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:55,730
You try to die, and it's hard to see
that happen and keep your mouth shut.

378
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:57,242
I'm trying to survive.

379
00:48:57,243 --> 00:48:59,040
Throwing yourself out.

380
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:03,051
You treat yourself like
a rotten piece of meat.

381
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:03,927
Shut up.

382
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,977
Do not do that.

383
00:53:12,278 --> 00:53:13,140
What?

384
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:14,276
Turn around.

385
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:16,559
You have to look and see everything.

386
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,891
So I can tell when I'm done.

387
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:20,991
Who?

388
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,801
But I am not a believer.

389
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:30,620
Why did you choose me?

390
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:34,430
I always know who to choose.

391
00:53:41,132 --> 00:53:42,030
Live.

392
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:04,903
Would you let me?

393
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:10,298
I just want to ask
you about an issue.

394
00:54:18,437 --> 00:54:20,437
What do you know about her?

395
00:54:21,038 --> 00:54:23,841
I see them talking
together sometimes.

396
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:28,249
Well, she's a militant communist,

397
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,762
She is also engaged to get married.

398
00:54:31,045 --> 00:54:35,323
It's that kind, since we're here
you have plans to survive, why?

399
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:37,093
I do not know.

400
00:54:37,094 --> 00:54:41,242
It's just... it looks so
different from the others.

401
00:54:41,243 --> 00:54:43,010
So full of courage.

402
00:54:43,211 --> 00:54:45,228
She says the same thing about you.

403
00:54:47,854 --> 00:54:50,801
She... She's talked about me.

404
00:54:50,802 --> 00:54:52,054
Rachel too.

405
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,551
Spatially admire your value,

406
00:54:55,652 --> 00:54:57,483
And your beauty.

407
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,940
She is... she is so beautiful.

408
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:08,327
Do not you think so?

409
00:55:10,128 --> 00:55:12,219
I love his smile.

410
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,999
It would be all faster if you tell
me what you do not like about it.

411
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,392
I do not understand what's
happening to me, Fania.

412
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:27,682
I think about her all day.

413
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:34,570
I just adore everything
she says and does.

414
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:35,695
Oh, you're in love with her.

415
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,348
Do you think that...

416
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:40,689
Why not?

417
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,495
They are very young.

418
00:55:42,496 --> 00:55:45,433
When you are so young,
only love matters.

419
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:51,464
I feel like...

420
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:54,221
I do not know what it is.

421
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,953
Oh, the human race.

422
00:56:01,554 --> 00:56:03,935
You are laughing at me?

423
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,331
No, for the pure,
everything is purity.

424
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:09,854
Do not despise yourself.

425
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:13,056
In this place feeling
something can be a blessing.

426
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:17,839
Have you ever had
feelings like that Fania?

427
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,058
Never.
Never. With nobody.

428
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:25,786
Go, let me get some sleep.

429
00:56:43,989 --> 00:56:46,489
What a correct young lady
you should have been.

430
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,582
Had I ever heard anything
more moving, Herr Commander?

431
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:24,473
Very good, very good, but the
musical opinion of Dr. Méngüele

432
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,419
Are much more expert, of course.

433
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:36,285
I've really been
totally touched.

434
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,906
You must thank the doctor, Fania.

435
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:55,017
Thank you Doctor.

436
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:57,280
I must tell you Fénelon that
I originally objected...

437
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:59,217
Excuse me Herr commander.

438
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:02,833
I must tell you that my
name is not really Fénelon,

439
01:01:02,834 --> 01:01:04,677
My mother's last name was Fénelon,

440
01:01:04,678 --> 01:01:07,241
My father's was Goldstein.

441
01:01:07,242 --> 01:01:09,037
I'm Fania Goldstein.

442
01:01:18,228 --> 01:01:21,919
Excuse me, I did not intend
to interrupt, Herr Commander.

443
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,088
You must learn to
sing German songs.

444
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:28,963
I'll see you begin learning them
immediately, Herr Commander.

445
01:01:31,164 --> 01:01:34,337
As I was saying, I was
opposed to this idea,

446
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:35,494
On the orchestra.

447
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:37,006
But now I must say

448
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:38,273
That a song like that

449
01:01:38,274 --> 01:01:43,151
It is a comfort that nourishes
the spirit and strengthens us

450
01:01:43,152 --> 01:01:46,793
For our difficult work.
Very good.

451
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:03,663
Fräulein Goldstein,

452
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:12,615
Is there anything you need especially?

453
01:02:18,964 --> 01:02:19,764
Good...

454
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:23,076
toothbrush?

455
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:26,483
Send it to Canada
for some things.

456
01:02:28,784 --> 01:02:30,276
With my congratulations.

457
01:02:33,278 --> 01:02:34,381
To Canada?

458
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:49,944
Ah the things of the Franchute.

459
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:51,713
Very clean.

460
01:02:53,114 --> 01:02:54,987
Welcome to Canada.

461
01:02:54,988 --> 01:02:57,478
There you have your filth, stupid.

462
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:16,868
You got a toothbrush,
can I see it?

463
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:19,124
Oh, it looks almost new.

464
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,092
Nothing like having something
imported from France, right?

465
01:03:23,093 --> 01:03:24,354
Hey what's up?

466
01:03:24,855 --> 01:03:26,919
What have you got against me?

467
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,367
Nothing.

468
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,288
It's just that I think
that's not the way

469
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:32,668
Correct to act with a superior.

470
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:34,552
But when they are the
owners of this place.

471
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:36,511
You expect me to congratulate
you on some of the things

472
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,959
What are you doing these days

473
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,164
What I am doing?

474
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:40,461
Oh, let's forget it.
- All right.

475
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:43,514
I personally feel much safer

476
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:45,121
Now that Mandel is
so hot with you.

477
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:47,299
Scared, but I'm grateful,

478
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,201
Otherwise I would not envy anyone

479
01:03:49,202 --> 01:03:51,336
That would wake up so close
to that arrogant Nazi.

480
01:03:51,337 --> 01:03:52,337
There is no danger of that.

481
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:53,316
You never know.

482
01:03:53,818 --> 01:03:56,303
Life does not always leave a
girl a lot to choose from.

483
01:03:56,304 --> 01:03:57,850
You were not given any alternative

484
01:03:57,851 --> 01:03:59,851
Considering the companies
you've been maintaining.

485
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:01,945
Listen to this skin and bones.

486
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:02,868
Well, maybe I am but

487
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:04,122
I'll wake up near Mandel

488
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:05,645
Sooner than many of you girls.

489
01:04:05,646 --> 01:04:07,623
That was disgusting, Etalina.

490
01:04:07,624 --> 01:04:09,490
Mandel is just a killer.

491
01:04:09,491 --> 01:04:11,530
Even so it's beautiful,
I'm sorry to bother you.

492
01:04:11,531 --> 01:04:13,719
If you had an ounce of Jewish pride

493
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,134
You could not call such
a monster beautiful.

494
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:18,102
Do not try to make her look ugly.

495
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:20,082
Is beautiful.

496
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,421
It is human.

497
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:24,687
What bothers me is

498
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:25,867
That a woman

499
01:04:25,868 --> 01:04:28,072
That is so beautiful

500
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:30,428
Can be doing such things.

501
01:04:30,948 --> 01:04:33,031
We are of the same species.

502
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:36,607
That's exactly what makes the
whole situation so black.

503
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:38,174
No, there is still hope.

504
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:42,769
Because when this war is over,
Europe will be a communist.

505
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:45,315
And for that, I want to live.

506
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:47,863
No, we'll try to go to Palestine.

507
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:50,883
To raise Jewish children in Palestine.

508
01:04:51,384 --> 01:04:53,945
You do not have any Fania identity.

509
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:57,700
And that's why you can call such
a human and beautiful monster.

510
01:04:58,101 --> 01:04:59,289
I envy you both.

511
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,601
They will not believe that they have solved the problem?

512
01:05:01,602 --> 01:05:04,215
What problem ?, I do not see a problem.

513
01:05:05,616 --> 01:05:07,102
She is human.

514
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:11,222
Like you, like me.

515
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:14,925
Do not you think that's a problem?

516
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,617
What does it matter to you?

517
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,587
Your hair comes out lighter.

518
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:02,247
Go to bed, Maria.

519
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:09,102
Well that happens, one of us
was a doctor from Vienna,

520
01:06:09,103 --> 01:06:11,077
He just went to check it out.

521
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:14,356
And I thought we would
never menstruate again.

522
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:15,234
Why?

523
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:20,611
Because of this fear,
every day and night.

524
01:06:20,612 --> 01:06:23,977
And the food can be sterilized.

525
01:06:41,462 --> 01:06:42,362
Maria

526
01:06:44,764 --> 01:06:47,349
You know, it's so weird, but I think

527
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,508
Maybe you can control your hunger.

528
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:52,167
If you could share what you get with

529
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:53,802
Some other woman, anyone.

530
01:06:54,203 --> 01:06:56,270
You know, sometimes a person

531
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:59,640
Needs the strength that comes
from giving something.

532
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,490
Fania...

533
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:07,630
about

534
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:09,770
To endure.

535
01:07:22,782 --> 01:07:24,282
Understand me.

536
01:07:24,283 --> 01:07:25,928
Is a musician.

537
01:07:25,929 --> 01:07:28,762
Tell them that... it should not be sacrificed.

538
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:31,606
To hospital.

539
01:07:31,607 --> 01:07:33,839
We need it very much.

540
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,339
Well, do you understand me or not?

541
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,194
Wait, wait.

542
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:40,658
Excuse me, Herr Oberstand fuhrer.

543
01:07:40,659 --> 01:07:41,785
With your permission.

544
01:07:41,786 --> 01:07:45,857
I could instruct these men that
this woman should not be hurt.

545
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:48,069
It's our cellist, you
should go to the hospital.

546
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,216
High fever, perhaps typhus.

547
01:07:50,217 --> 01:07:51,291
I do not know what language they speak.

548
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:56,150
He speaks Italian, Spanish,
Russian, Romanian,

549
01:07:56,151 --> 01:07:57,578
Is not she fantastic?

550
01:07:57,579 --> 01:07:59,028
It is very insistent.

551
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:02,712
Yes, that is Mala the
head of interpreters.

552
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:05,657
She's Jewish, but
she's intimidated.

553
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:06,986
How is that possible?

554
01:08:06,987 --> 01:08:09,152
Mala has been here
longer than anyone else,

555
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:10,468
Since the field was built.

556
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:12,412
She was supposed to be gassed,

557
01:08:12,413 --> 01:08:14,890
But escaped with
five other girls.

558
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,428
Did he actually get out?

559
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:19,185
Yes, it started by opening
a ventilation duct,

560
01:08:19,186 --> 01:08:20,715
Already had managed to pass
the house of the commander,

561
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:22,474
When he saw them out on the road.

562
01:08:22,475 --> 01:08:26,710
Guess what Mala did
then, demanded clothes.

563
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,604
When they spoke, they realized that

564
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,592
She practically spoke
all languages.

565
01:08:30,593 --> 01:08:33,097
He is very high in the Belgian resistance.

566
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:35,804
He even has a lover here.

567
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:37,097
No, you have to be kidding.

568
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:38,013
Is not true.

569
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,229
They save people.

570
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,353
A few, anyway.

571
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:42,958
And help others.

572
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,697
Fania.

573
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:47,323
Come, we must work
on Schubert's song.

574
01:08:51,025 --> 01:08:53,038
You have to practice
the "HRU" sound again,

575
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:55,935
Dr. Mengele has a sensitive
ear for language.

576
01:08:55,936 --> 01:08:56,944
He has required it.

577
01:09:20,915 --> 01:09:23,074
I hope she's never stupid
enough to cover up a language.

578
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:25,275
Well, from the beginning.

579
01:09:39,912 --> 01:09:42,412
Excuse me Madam, meet Mala.

580
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,737
Yes very good.

581
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,927
How did you manage to
make yourself respected?

582
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,732
Well, it's extremely
useful, of course.

583
01:09:53,767 --> 01:09:55,634
Speak fluently 9
or 10 languages,

584
01:09:55,635 --> 01:09:57,531
And with so many
nationalities in the camp

585
01:09:57,532 --> 01:09:59,264
Makes it possible to communicate.

586
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:01,672
Is that all?

587
01:10:01,673 --> 01:10:03,318
It even seems...

588
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:05,766
That overwhelms them.
Is incredible.

589
01:10:07,857 --> 01:10:10,428
Mala is one of those people
whose superiority is clear.

590
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:12,354
Even for the ignorant.

591
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:15,207
Bad is...

592
01:10:16,608 --> 01:10:17,741
Miraculous

593
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,930
Raising a shield among
those kind of people,

594
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:24,453
Like the cloth around
the precious seeds.

595
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,157
It is everyone's hope here.

596
01:10:30,558 --> 01:10:34,617
Even those Nazis perceive
that kind of glory in it.

597
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:38,907
She is a miracle.

598
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,513
Are you trying to destroy us?

599
01:11:02,514 --> 01:11:05,087
That was a high octave.
Do you know what is tall or not?

600
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:08,443
I asked if you know what the
octaves are tall or not?

601
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:48,484
They should try harder.

602
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:51,995
As things stand, Dr. Mengele
hardly bears listening to us,

603
01:11:51,996 --> 01:11:54,203
If we come down from a certain
level, anything can happen.

604
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,206
He is a vile and variable man.

605
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:00,957
The truth is...

606
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:02,170
If it were not for my reputation

607
01:12:02,171 --> 01:12:03,997
They would have roasted them long ago.

608
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:08,181
My father was the first violin
of the Vienna Philharmonic,

609
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,716
His string quartet played
all over the world.

610
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:15,422
My own "Viennese Waltzing Girls"
They played in most of Europe.

611
01:12:15,423 --> 01:12:16,789
I know that.

612
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,502
For I am a Rosé and I am directing...

613
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:22,325
A group of prisoners.

614
01:12:23,858 --> 01:12:26,240
So, why do they resent me?

615
01:12:27,789 --> 01:12:29,283
You are professional,

616
01:12:29,984 --> 01:12:32,488
Knows that strict
discipline is required,

617
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:35,629
The director must be respected.

618
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:37,726
I think it can also be loved.

619
01:12:37,727 --> 01:12:40,832
He can not love what
is not respected!

620
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:44,993
It is perfectly traditional,

621
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:46,710
In Austria, in Germany,
when a musician is

622
01:12:46,711 --> 01:12:48,182
Repeatedly wrong...
- Slapping?

623
01:12:48,183 --> 01:12:49,274
Yes of course.

624
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:53,692
Furtwängler did it very often but
his orchestras idolized him.

625
01:12:59,094 --> 01:13:00,949
I need your support, Fania.

626
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:07,161
I realize that they respect her,

627
01:13:07,162 --> 01:13:09,156
Must support what they claim to them.

628
01:13:09,157 --> 01:13:12,186
We must constantly raise the
level of our execution,

629
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:17,588
Or, I really do not know how
long they will bear us.

630
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,564
Will you help me?

631
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:26,096
It will?

632
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,810
I'm going to tell you the truth,

633
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,532
I really do not know how
long I can bear this.

634
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:40,188
I'm trying the best I can.

635
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:42,220
And I'll keep trying.

636
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:44,946
But sometimes I get the impression

637
01:13:44,947 --> 01:13:47,433
Of which parts of
me are collapsing.

638
01:13:47,434 --> 01:13:50,485
And believe me,

639
01:13:50,486 --> 01:13:53,935
I recognize that it is about
their strength, probably,

640
01:13:53,936 --> 01:13:56,333
That our lives depend on.

641
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,275
So why do they resent me?

642
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:02,836
I do not know.

643
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:06,790
I guess... maybe...
It is simply that

644
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:11,564
When a monster keeps
something in reserve,

645
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:15,962
We can not, we can not really
dedicate ourselves to please them.

646
01:14:15,963 --> 01:14:17,512
But he has to want
to please them,

647
01:14:17,513 --> 01:14:19,298
And with all his heart.

648
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:23,011
You are an artist who can only
propose to give the best of herself.

649
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:28,078
But when you look
through the window...

650
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,336
That's why I told you not
to look out the window.

651
01:14:31,371 --> 01:14:33,036
Fania was wrong,

652
01:14:33,037 --> 01:14:35,186
Seems to believe that I have stopped seeing.

653
01:14:36,187 --> 01:14:38,582
I refused to look.

654
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,172
Before they brought me here,

655
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:47,159
Had begun to love,

656
01:14:50,173 --> 01:14:51,216
To a young man,

657
01:14:52,217 --> 01:14:53,713
Come as me

658
01:14:58,015 --> 01:15:00,056
He is now a soldier in the Wehrmacht.

659
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:03,756
The three best months of my life...

660
01:15:12,974 --> 01:15:14,974
The three best months of my life.

661
01:15:17,676 --> 01:15:20,227
Oh. He wanted me, like a coat.

662
01:15:23,128 --> 01:15:25,144
Then I was arrested for being a Jewess.

663
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:30,048
It still surprises me.

664
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:33,944
Why is she also German?

665
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:38,412
Yes, I am, German.

666
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,836
In this place Fania,

667
01:15:45,837 --> 01:15:47,712
You will have to be an artist,

668
01:15:47,713 --> 01:15:50,497
And only artist.

669
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:55,144
You will have to concentrate
on one thing only,

670
01:15:55,802 --> 01:16:00,656
And it is the creation of all the
beauty that it is capable of creating.

671
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:10,890
Excuse me.

672
01:18:08,503 --> 01:18:09,503
Attention!

673
01:18:09,904 --> 01:18:10,941
Get Aligned!

674
01:18:19,656 --> 01:18:21,156
Jews on the left.

675
01:18:21,157 --> 01:18:22,339
Aririos on the right.

676
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:26,785
She and I are only half.

677
01:18:28,186 --> 01:18:30,002
Half what?

678
01:18:30,256 --> 01:18:31,829
Middle Jews.

679
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,196
Our mothers were Aryan,

680
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:37,839
Mestizos are not meant to
be gassed, Frau Schmidt.

681
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:38,915
I am completely sure.

682
01:18:38,916 --> 01:18:41,733
Why, if I may ask,
is this selection?

683
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:46,864
You belong to the Jews.

684
01:18:51,665 --> 01:18:53,614
Get ready to sing.

685
01:18:54,665 --> 01:18:56,732
Nobody wants to end
their lives this time.

686
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,628
Move!

687
01:19:01,873 --> 01:19:04,374
Half Jews, follow me.

688
01:19:12,596 --> 01:19:16,914
In that case they are allowed to
cut the top half of the star.

689
01:19:24,616 --> 01:19:26,617
Was that proposal correct?

690
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:29,236
It is disgusting to cut the
star of David in half.

691
01:19:29,237 --> 01:19:30,002
Why not?

692
01:19:30,003 --> 01:19:31,304
If we can avoid the gas.

693
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:35,870
Disgusting are you.
Jewish nationalists,

694
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,658
Since when they are custodians
of the principles...

695
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:42,655
Do not you dare get
into your traps.

696
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:45,325
Your discomfort does not impress me,

697
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,716
Because you accepted even
greater humiliation,

698
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:49,031
Without a gesture.

699
01:19:49,032 --> 01:19:50,466
We are just a convenience.

700
01:19:53,267 --> 01:19:56,857
The blood of innocent Jews
cries out for their betrayal.

701
01:19:57,358 --> 01:19:59,885
Why do not they just shut up?

702
01:20:00,286 --> 01:20:02,353
I'm sick of Jews and heathens,

703
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:03,944
The Westerners, the Orientals,

704
01:20:03,945 --> 01:20:06,187
The Germans, the non-Germans,

705
01:20:06,188 --> 01:20:07,810
The French, the non-French,

706
01:20:07,811 --> 01:20:11,618
I'm tired, I'm tired...
I'm sick

707
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,851
I am a woman, not a tribe.

708
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:17,685
And I have been humiliated,

709
01:20:17,686 --> 01:20:19,072
That's all I know.

710
01:20:22,173 --> 01:20:24,003
You're all just jealous,

711
01:20:24,004 --> 01:20:26,230
Anyway they also educated
us as Catholics,

712
01:20:26,631 --> 01:20:29,098
After all, our mothers
were Catholic.

713
01:20:44,995 --> 01:20:46,995
What are you doing that for?

714
01:20:50,097 --> 01:20:50,993
Fania...

715
01:20:51,928 --> 01:20:53,700
I do not know.

716
01:20:56,153 --> 01:20:58,168
I'm doing.

717
01:20:59,569 --> 01:21:02,059
That's right, I'm doing it.

718
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:20,575
Fania.

719
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:29,220
In front of you, up at the door.

720
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:34,800
Thank you.

721
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:40,496
Fania, they are gassing
12,000 every day now.

722
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,647
12,000 angels,

723
01:21:44,848 --> 01:21:46,873
Flying above.

724
01:21:48,574 --> 01:21:49,864
Every day.

725
01:21:51,465 --> 01:21:54,473
Why do you keep telling
me these things?

726
01:21:54,774 --> 01:21:56,196
What do you want from me?

727
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:57,580
Look over your eyes,

728
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,466
The air is full of angels.

729
01:22:09,176 --> 01:22:10,676
Two more cigarettes,

730
01:22:10,877 --> 01:22:12,888
You took more time this time.

731
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:15,780
I'm broken, I'll give
it to you next time.

732
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:28,049
At least share some of
what you get with others.

733
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:28,928
For your own good,

734
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:31,825
So that you do not end up
becoming a complete animal.

735
01:22:33,514 --> 01:22:34,531
Jealous?

736
01:24:22,338 --> 01:24:23,839
All present, Herr Captain.

737
01:24:26,222 --> 01:24:27,722
Do you know who Mala is?

738
01:24:29,223 --> 01:24:30,770
Bad, not very good,

739
01:24:30,771 --> 01:24:32,757
I have seen her, of course,
she has accompanied me with

740
01:24:32,758 --> 01:24:34,991
With the commander, Herr Captain,

741
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:35,997
As an interpreter.

742
01:24:42,735 --> 01:24:45,236
He has not had any contact
with his musicians.

743
01:24:45,237 --> 01:24:47,128
No, Herr Captain,

744
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:50,001
She has visited the
barracks for not recently.

745
01:25:31,345 --> 01:25:32,090
Attention!

746
01:25:41,909 --> 01:25:43,409
Mala escaped.

747
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:44,553
And he helped two.

748
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:47,239
They got SS uniforms,

749
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,805
Somehow and flew.

750
01:25:51,908 --> 01:25:53,408
What a romance!

751
01:25:54,572 --> 01:25:57,572
Imagine, the two together.

752
01:26:01,268 --> 01:26:04,233
I saw him once, he
is a good fighter,

753
01:26:04,234 --> 01:26:07,293
Blond with beautiful white teeth.

754
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:08,889
She is Belgian, like me.

755
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:12,783
What a Belgian, she is
Jewish like all of us.

756
01:26:12,784 --> 01:26:16,181
Eric is Polish, and they are going to
tell the world what is going on here.

757
01:26:16,182 --> 01:26:19,325
Imagine, they could have
exploded that chimney.

758
01:26:19,326 --> 01:26:22,810
Listen, listen, let's
play something for them.

759
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:23,587
Oh yeah.

760
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:45,099
Allies land France.

761
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,850
Silence now,

762
01:26:47,851 --> 01:26:49,881
I have corrections.

763
01:26:49,882 --> 01:26:53,772
Paulette, on page 5, letter B, you
will do it in D sharp instead of...

764
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:11,499
Etalin...

765
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,551
Those are not Jews, they are Poles.

766
01:27:13,552 --> 01:27:15,357
Hitler said he was going
to kill all the Poles

767
01:27:15,358 --> 01:27:17,192
To make room for
the Germans there.

768
01:27:17,193 --> 01:27:20,692
But there must be thousands, they
would never kill so many Aryans.

769
01:27:20,693 --> 01:27:22,555
What are they going to do with them?

770
01:27:22,556 --> 01:27:24,572
I think they're going to
put them in these stalls.

771
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,280
Ladislaus,

772
01:27:43,482 --> 01:27:44,322
Ladislaus...

773
01:28:03,625 --> 01:28:05,073
It's not beautiful?

774
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:12,983
What happens to them?

775
01:28:13,484 --> 01:28:14,946
Is nothing.

776
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:16,427
Frau Lagerfuhrerin.

777
01:28:16,428 --> 01:28:20,634
There is a rumor that these Polish Aryans
were going to put them in our barracks.

778
01:28:21,774 --> 01:28:23,797
No way, Madame.

779
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:29,698
In fact I can tell you that there will
be no more selections in our field.

780
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:35,191
Of course, there is no
room for newcomers,

781
01:28:38,092 --> 01:28:40,096
There will be other instances.

782
01:29:06,201 --> 01:29:07,612
Oh, look here.

783
01:29:09,313 --> 01:29:10,254
Check it out.

784
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:14,921
And now...

785
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:18,185
Let's get you a nice
new suit, some shoes

786
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,868
And a sweet little friend.
Come with me.

787
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:26,057
Work hard now.

788
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:37,140
So he's a human
being, after all.

789
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:39,834
Is she? But where is the mother?

790
01:29:39,835 --> 01:29:42,729
Even so, in a way,

791
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:45,609
I want to say that at least
he adores the child.

792
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:49,709
What is going on here?

793
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,440
Everything she said...

794
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:54,993
What was that he say?
And suddenly it is human.

795
01:29:56,995 --> 01:29:59,426
What is going on here?

796
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:04,214
From the beginning.

797
01:30:04,716 --> 01:30:05,608
Come on.

798
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:24,079
We are going to...

799
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:27,693
Attention!

800
01:34:30,994 --> 01:34:35,093
The officers have decided to keep the piano
in their club for the use of its members.

801
01:34:35,094 --> 01:34:36,717
Can you handle it without him?

802
01:34:36,718 --> 01:34:39,612
Yes, of course, Herr commander.

803
01:34:39,613 --> 01:34:42,694
It was just a little extra
sound, but it's not mandatory.

804
01:34:42,695 --> 01:34:45,065
What is Greta, the Dutch girl?

805
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:48,495
In front!

806
01:34:52,996 --> 01:34:54,463
Open your mouth.

807
01:34:55,664 --> 01:34:57,735
Do you have any illness?

808
01:34:57,736 --> 01:34:59,810
No, no, Herr Commander.

809
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:02,940
Dr. Mengele told me that he
is not a very good musician.

810
01:35:03,841 --> 01:35:07,356
No, not very good, but
not very bad either.

811
01:35:07,357 --> 01:35:08,948
But he works very hard...

812
01:35:08,949 --> 01:35:11,246
But could it be handled without it?

813
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:13,159
Why?

814
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,509
Yes, of course, Herr commander.

815
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:20,259
My wife needs someone to look
after our little daughters.

816
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:21,976
You are coming with me.

817
01:35:25,478 --> 01:35:28,742
He will play in the hospital for
the sick and the mental patients,

818
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:30,346
You will have ready to Beethoven.

819
01:35:30,347 --> 01:35:33,015
Yes, Herr Commander,

820
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:37,216
I must ask for your tolerance, if I may.

821
01:35:38,117 --> 01:35:40,140
Our cellist has typhus,

822
01:35:40,141 --> 01:35:45,250
And now without the piano too, we may sound
rather deficient in the bass records.

823
01:35:45,251 --> 01:35:47,772
I'll send one of the men's
orchestra cellists,

824
01:35:47,773 --> 01:35:50,060
Have several from the Berlin Philharmonic.

825
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:52,443
He can train one of his
violinists for Sunday.

826
01:35:54,645 --> 01:35:58,704
Well... of course Herr commander

827
01:35:58,705 --> 01:36:03,433
I'm sure she can teach one
of the girls for Sunday.

828
01:36:03,434 --> 01:36:04,171
Yes.

829
01:36:07,272 --> 01:36:10,649
It will be very interesting Madame, Dr.
Mengele.

830
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:13,540
Wants to observe the effect
of music on the insane.

831
01:36:13,575 --> 01:36:17,068
Ahh. We will really do our best.

832
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:32,643
And how have you been these days?

833
01:36:33,444 --> 01:36:35,464
I'm quite well.

834
01:36:37,365 --> 01:36:42,393
Of course, we, all of us
have been very hungry,

835
01:36:42,394 --> 01:36:43,578
most of the time.

836
01:36:43,579 --> 01:36:45,412
And that makes it very difficult.

837
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:49,413
I offered to send two additional rations, but

838
01:36:49,414 --> 01:36:51,874
Mme. Rosé believed that
you had to win them,

839
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:54,333
As a reward.

840
01:36:57,034 --> 01:36:58,574
Would not you agree?

841
01:37:06,844 --> 01:37:12,374
It's not me who has to agree or
not, without being the director.

842
01:37:15,976 --> 01:37:17,452
Close the door.

843
01:37:21,653 --> 01:37:23,750
How dare he make such a comment?

844
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:27,418
I do not understand, I just
told him we were hungry.

845
01:37:27,419 --> 01:37:29,012
When they can interpret a simple piece

846
01:37:29,013 --> 01:37:31,426
Without making a mistake, I will
recommend the extra ration,

847
01:37:31,427 --> 01:37:33,332
But I'll decide that,
you understand?

848
01:37:36,251 --> 01:37:38,308
There can not be two leaders.

849
01:37:39,009 --> 01:37:41,099
Do you agree or not?

850
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,444
Are you upset?

851
01:37:43,445 --> 01:37:47,502
We're hungry, that's
what I was saying.

852
01:37:47,503 --> 01:37:51,099
In this situation we
lose human feelings,

853
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,457
She asked and I told her.

854
01:37:53,259 --> 01:37:55,300
I think we understand
each other.

855
01:37:57,601 --> 01:37:59,088
That's all for now.

856
01:38:03,690 --> 01:38:05,109
Yes, whats up?

857
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:07,376
Nothing.

858
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:10,766
I'm really trying to
decide if I should leave.

859
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,681
Oh, come on, Fania, nobody lets
himself die if he can help it.

860
01:38:16,982 --> 01:38:19,498
You should try to be more
honest with yourself.

861
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:25,653
Go away.

862
01:38:49,078 --> 01:38:50,578
It's here.

863
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:52,850
The cellist of the male orchestra.

864
01:39:38,952 --> 01:39:40,881
Paulette! Paulette!

865
01:39:42,282 --> 01:39:43,653
Good to see you.

866
01:39:51,456 --> 01:39:53,245
Do you want to say something? What is it?

867
01:39:53,938 --> 01:39:58,361
You're going to play on Sunday...
- At the hospital.

868
01:40:00,289 --> 01:40:01,809
You do not look good...
- Silence.

869
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:06,904
They have planned...

870
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:12,283
Gassing... all patients,

871
01:40:12,284 --> 01:40:14,629
After the concert.

872
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:17,892
How did you know that?

873
01:40:19,393 --> 01:40:21,461
One of the women of the SS

874
01:40:21,462 --> 01:40:24,750
She warned me, I met her once.

875
01:40:25,444 --> 01:40:28,436
I used to be a
waitress in our house.

876
01:40:29,272 --> 01:40:31,309
So I left.

877
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:35,924
Paulette, welcome.

878
01:40:38,526 --> 01:40:40,619
We were desperate for you.

879
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,734
We do Beethoven's
fifth on Sunday.

880
01:40:42,735 --> 01:40:45,858
Mme. He could lie down for a while.

881
01:40:45,859 --> 01:40:47,028
Do not.

882
01:40:48,329 --> 01:40:49,212
Do not.

883
01:40:50,813 --> 01:40:52,815
I... I... I can.

884
01:40:58,417 --> 01:40:59,964
Let's start.

885
01:41:04,165 --> 01:41:05,675
From the beginning.

886
01:41:57,946 --> 01:41:58,746
I believe...

887
01:42:02,947 --> 01:42:04,191
that I...

888
01:42:05,278 --> 01:42:07,475
I saw my mother yesterday

889
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:14,343
My three sisters and my father.

890
01:42:16,044 --> 01:42:19,514
What? Where?
What are you talking about?

891
01:42:21,816 --> 01:42:22,739
Yesterday...

892
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,560
The last convoy of Bucharest...

893
01:42:30,461 --> 01:42:33,511
The mirror, when we played outside,

894
01:42:33,912 --> 01:42:35,362
A train arrived,

895
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:38,184
Look...

896
01:42:40,185 --> 01:42:42,762
And... I was not...

897
01:42:44,563 --> 01:42:46,984
I was not sure.

898
01:42:53,486 --> 01:42:55,557
But what could you do?

899
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:15,204
Does it bother you to wash?

900
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:31,949
Thank you,

901
01:43:33,201 --> 01:43:36,072
Fania, I am tormented,

902
01:43:36,107 --> 01:43:39,501
About whether I should have
warned the other patients

903
01:43:39,502 --> 01:43:41,712
About what was going to happen to them.

904
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,011
What you think?

905
01:43:46,212 --> 01:43:49,291
Except that he would
let them know.

906
01:43:49,992 --> 01:43:52,483
I no longer have any anxiety Paulette,

907
01:43:52,484 --> 01:43:53,994
I live from minute to minute,

908
01:43:53,995 --> 01:43:55,689
My heart beats, so I'm alive,

909
01:43:55,690 --> 01:43:57,942
But I'm filling up with dust.

910
01:44:01,313 --> 01:44:02,234
Go to sleep.

911
01:44:57,854 --> 01:44:58,654
American people.

912
01:45:05,856 --> 01:45:07,924
Hope for you Fania.

913
01:45:11,126 --> 01:45:14,145
Maybe it's too late for the
whole human race, Varya.

914
01:45:53,566 --> 01:45:56,239
So after all it will end.

915
01:46:03,969 --> 01:46:07,011
Everyone comes to tell you
their problems, does not it?

916
01:46:12,413 --> 01:46:14,429
I do not know why they tell me.

917
01:46:18,015 --> 01:46:20,089
You're someone to trust, Fania.

918
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:24,018
Maybe it's because you
have no ideology,

919
01:46:24,619 --> 01:46:26,661
And you are satisfied with being a person.

920
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:31,330
There is so much feeling in you.

921
01:46:33,332 --> 01:46:34,850
It was that way, yes.

922
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:38,485
But you can not cross my
hands with my fingernails,

923
01:46:38,486 --> 01:46:39,879
To be able to face me with
such strong material.

924
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,394
That's the truth.

925
01:46:43,595 --> 01:46:45,666
I'm dying to pieces.

926
01:46:45,667 --> 01:46:50,167
I know. Very well, I seem
to be, too, too, too...

927
01:46:52,768 --> 01:46:55,858
It's making it harder
for me to eat anything.

928
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:07,524
I am one of the most successful
actresses in Poland,

929
01:47:08,782 --> 01:47:10,739
My father was an earl,

930
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,761
I was born in a castle.

931
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:17,814
I have a husband and...

932
01:47:17,815 --> 01:47:21,440
Narok, my son is 9 years old.

933
01:47:22,693 --> 01:47:26,711
I do not know what will happen to us,
Fania, you know, before the end.

934
01:47:29,412 --> 01:47:32,335
I just want a Jewish
woman to understand...

935
01:47:34,851 --> 01:47:35,815
When they first brought me here,

936
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:38,697
I was sure that the Pope
and the Christian leaders

937
01:47:38,698 --> 01:47:39,725
Who did not know.

938
01:47:39,726 --> 01:47:42,695
When they found out they were
going to send planes to bomb

939
01:47:42,696 --> 01:47:46,839
The incinerators and the trains
that bring them here every day.

940
01:47:47,741 --> 01:47:52,173
But the trains kept coming and
the incinerators burning.

941
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:54,965
Do you understand?

942
01:47:56,066 --> 01:47:57,555
Do you understand?

943
01:48:00,156 --> 01:48:02,617
Perhaps there is something more important to them.

944
01:48:02,618 --> 01:48:04,604
So that we are here, in any way,

945
01:48:04,605 --> 01:48:06,497
A group of women who can
not even menstruate

946
01:48:06,498 --> 01:48:08,079
Innocent people who frighten men.

947
01:48:10,981 --> 01:48:14,041
Oh, Fania, please forgive me.

948
01:48:23,443 --> 01:48:24,259
Your...

949
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,568
Why?

950
01:48:30,169 --> 01:48:32,880
What did you do to me?

951
01:48:34,888 --> 01:48:37,530
Were you in the resistance?

952
01:48:37,839 --> 01:48:40,322
Did you try to fight
against this?

953
01:48:40,323 --> 01:48:42,281
Why do you have to feel guilty?

954
01:48:45,282 --> 01:48:47,706
Confide it, or it will destroy us.

955
01:48:48,107 --> 01:48:50,642
If you survive you feel that you are innocent.

956
01:48:54,844 --> 01:48:56,756
Everything is a joke,

957
01:48:58,128 --> 01:48:59,392
You do not see it.

958
01:49:02,394 --> 01:49:03,901
Has no sense.

959
01:49:07,202 --> 01:49:10,182
I'm afraid nothing you would have
done would have changed that.

960
01:49:24,317 --> 01:49:27,817
I almost feel more sorrow for
people like you than for us,

961
01:49:28,618 --> 01:49:30,651
And you, you will survive.

962
01:49:31,953 --> 01:49:34,524
All those around you
will be in sin,

963
01:49:36,525 --> 01:49:38,555
From one end to the other.

964
01:49:39,756 --> 01:49:43,845
And those with whom you
can never speak again.

965
01:49:51,247 --> 01:49:53,792
My memory falls to pieces,
- Did We Go?

966
01:49:53,827 --> 01:49:55,558
Were we Russian last night?
Did we go?

967
01:50:05,085 --> 01:50:07,182
You dropped the milk, Yakovska.

968
01:50:07,283 --> 01:50:08,820
Was mine.

969
01:50:09,421 --> 01:50:10,926
But still.

970
01:50:10,927 --> 01:50:13,484
Our farm is 10
kilometers from here.

971
01:50:13,485 --> 01:50:14,901
They bring it to me.

972
01:50:14,902 --> 01:50:16,064
My sister.

973
01:50:17,165 --> 01:50:19,222
But still.
To throw it that way...

974
01:50:19,223 --> 01:50:22,072
Are you saying it's not my milk?

975
01:50:30,174 --> 01:50:31,666
Do not worry.

976
01:50:35,367 --> 01:50:36,931
Do not worry.

977
01:50:37,532 --> 01:50:41,111
You read too many books.
They drive you crazy.

978
01:51:06,815 --> 01:51:07,683
Fania.

979
01:51:09,685 --> 01:51:11,709
I leave for "Baselhauser" on Sunday.

980
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:15,880
They send me on a tour
to play for the troops.

981
01:51:17,081 --> 01:51:19,498
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

982
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:26,017
I'm going to be released, Fania.
Can you imagine?

983
01:51:27,018 --> 01:51:30,106
I will touch what I like,
and how I like it.

984
01:51:32,007 --> 01:51:35,546
They say that a musician of my
talent should not be wasted here.

985
01:51:38,848 --> 01:51:42,349
What is the problem?
I thought he would be happy for me.

986
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:45,666
Well, yes, I am.
Of course.

987
01:51:45,667 --> 01:51:49,728
But, while he is playing, he will continue to
fight because he does not enslave us. It will?

988
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:51,796
But that's not the point.

989
01:51:51,797 --> 01:51:54,847
I'll be playing for soldiers, Fania.

990
01:51:54,848 --> 01:51:57,791
And what about us?
Will we continue? Will we?

991
01:51:57,792 --> 01:52:00,437
I intend to suggest
that you replace me.

992
01:52:03,138 --> 01:52:04,582
Oh well...

993
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:09,165
I hope that soon we will follow...
before ..

994
01:52:11,104 --> 01:52:13,676
Why are you trying to
ruin my happiness?

995
01:52:14,277 --> 01:52:16,345
I will be playing
for honorable men.

996
01:52:18,046 --> 01:52:20,629
Not for murderers
like these here.

997
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:22,281
Soldiers risk their lives.

998
01:52:22,282 --> 01:52:24,722
Why do you need my
approval if you are happy?

999
01:52:24,723 --> 01:52:25,723
Enjoy your happiness.

1000
01:52:25,724 --> 01:52:27,454
Not all Germans are Nazis.

1001
01:52:27,455 --> 01:52:29,224
You're just a racist
if you think so.

1002
01:52:33,626 --> 01:52:35,092
I agree.

1003
01:52:36,093 --> 01:52:37,607
It is an extraordinary honor,

1004
01:52:37,608 --> 01:52:42,202
The only Jew who will play the
violin for the Germans in the army,

1005
01:52:42,203 --> 01:52:44,631
my head is going to explode!

1006
01:52:46,232 --> 01:52:47,188
Frau Schmidt

1007
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,999
Only for...

1008
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:58,944
Just to extend my
congratulations.

1009
01:53:00,046 --> 01:53:02,056
I just heard the big news.

1010
01:53:04,557 --> 01:53:05,486
Thank you.

1011
01:53:05,887 --> 01:53:07,350
Thank you, Frau Schmidt.

1012
01:53:09,251 --> 01:53:12,330
It is very touching for
me, coming from you.

1013
01:53:14,132 --> 01:53:18,068
Well, I've never been known
to hide my feelings.

1014
01:53:21,169 --> 01:53:23,756
He'll join us for
dinner tonight.

1015
01:53:24,457 --> 01:53:26,918
It's a farewell
dinner in his honor.

1016
01:53:28,419 --> 01:53:31,466
I'm overwhelmed, Frau
Schmidt, of course.

1017
01:53:33,467 --> 01:53:36,995
In short, "in a shoe minister"

1018
01:53:45,031 --> 01:53:49,414
In my rooms, yes.
- I will be there. Thank you.

1019
01:53:49,615 --> 01:53:51,635
Thank you, Frau Schmidt.

1020
01:53:56,536 --> 01:53:58,687
Do not you realize?, really...

1021
01:53:58,688 --> 01:54:03,195
That woman, that woman...

1022
01:54:03,196 --> 01:54:06,869
He has tried everything to
be transferred from here.

1023
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:10,235
Yeah, she's desperate to get out of here.

1024
01:54:10,236 --> 01:54:16,116
And he has the kindness to come
to wish me well in my departure.

1025
01:54:18,517 --> 01:54:21,554
Well, that's certainly something I
would never have expected from her.

1026
01:54:23,055 --> 01:54:26,083
It is amazing what is
in the human heart.

1027
01:54:26,484 --> 01:54:28,016
You judge people, Fania,

1028
01:54:28,017 --> 01:54:30,336
You are terribly strict.

1029
01:54:31,237 --> 01:54:34,721
Beware of that charm, maybe
they are losing the war.

1030
01:54:34,722 --> 01:54:37,870
So... - Why does everything
have to have war inside?

1031
01:54:40,396 --> 01:54:43,146
Why can not you accept
the little hope in life?

1032
01:54:46,714 --> 01:54:48,259
I'm all confused.

1033
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:51,638
That Schmidt wants it to go
well is really inconceivable.

1034
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:54,901
Alma, she's getting rich
in the black market,

1035
01:54:54,936 --> 01:54:57,047
Has stolen every woman
who has come here.

1036
01:54:57,048 --> 01:54:59,237
His hand is in everything
that moves in this place.

1037
01:55:00,038 --> 01:55:01,494
I'm going there Fania.

1038
01:55:05,095 --> 01:55:08,176
If I do not have another chance, I
would like to thank you for your help.

1039
01:55:20,258 --> 01:55:23,291
It is totally wrong about
practically everything,

1040
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:29,839
I must say that you
probably saved our lives,

1041
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,514
So I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1042
01:55:34,415 --> 01:55:37,508
You can thank him that I
refused to despair, Fania.

1043
01:55:39,809 --> 01:55:41,877
That's true, is not it?

1044
01:59:52,489 --> 01:59:53,489
What happened?

1045
01:59:53,490 --> 01:59:56,325
Schmidt poisoned her, at dinner.

1046
01:59:57,326 --> 01:59:58,864
But you can not know?

1047
01:59:58,865 --> 02:00:00,223
She was shot this morning.

1048
02:00:02,424 --> 02:00:03,359
Schmidt?

1049
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,822
No one was going to leave here
unless she could, especially a Jew.

1050
02:00:06,823 --> 02:00:08,062
You mean I wanted her dead?

1051
02:00:08,063 --> 02:00:10,303
She wrote her epitaph, Why not?

1052
02:00:28,725 --> 02:00:31,054
No no no.
Order, order

1053
02:00:31,126 --> 02:00:33,705
Tanya, what are you rehearsing for?
Now, move.

1054
02:00:33,784 --> 02:00:36,086
No, I'm not leaving.
- Let me stop the rehearsal.

1055
02:00:36,685 --> 02:00:37,616
Come on.

1056
02:00:37,617 --> 02:00:38,432
Mariane,

1057
02:00:38,433 --> 02:00:40,638
Do not touch it like that.

1058
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:41,942
Now, listen to me.

1059
02:00:44,043 --> 02:00:47,067
Now I am the director and ordered
you to stop interfering.

1060
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:24,571
Fania, Fania...

1061
02:02:40,279 --> 02:02:42,279
With the executioner?

1062
02:02:54,603 --> 02:02:57,103
Did he kill Mala and Edic?

1063
02:02:57,304 --> 02:02:58,777
You know that?

1064
02:02:59,478 --> 02:03:03,267
Well, if he did not, someone else
would have, you can be sure of that.

1065
02:03:07,568 --> 02:03:09,626
I want to tell you that there is something...

1066
02:03:09,627 --> 02:03:13,190
On which side do you think they are?

1067
02:03:15,391 --> 02:03:20,582
Because if someone is not sure, they
are on the side of the executioners.

1068
02:03:21,383 --> 02:03:26,857
Come out, ask any
prisoners in this camp.

1069
02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:29,909
They will be happy to tell you.

1070
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:33,709
So you know where exactly
you can put your comments.

1071
02:03:41,045 --> 02:03:43,406
You should not have let
him do that, Fania.

1072
02:03:43,407 --> 02:03:46,058
I answered but nobody
heard what I said.

1073
02:03:48,059 --> 02:03:49,571
But he is right,

1074
02:03:49,572 --> 02:03:52,024
And I also think it's a serious thing.

1075
02:03:53,526 --> 02:03:55,533
I'm not on your side.

1076
02:03:55,534 --> 02:03:58,532
I'm just trying to
survive for Jerusalem.

1077
02:03:59,633 --> 02:04:00,470
All right.

1078
02:04:02,972 --> 02:04:05,505
What do you mean, Fania?

1079
02:04:05,906 --> 02:04:07,735
I mean, this is fine.

1080
02:04:07,736 --> 02:04:12,891
If you can get away from
what war is, so clean.

1081
02:04:12,892 --> 02:04:15,899
But we are not
responsible for this.

1082
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:19,035
No, of course not.
Nothing here is our fault.

1083
02:04:23,637 --> 02:04:26,858
What I mean is this,
maybe we are innocent,

1084
02:04:28,659 --> 02:04:30,167
But we have changed.

1085
02:04:31,469 --> 02:04:34,659
I want to say that we know something
more about the human race,

1086
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:36,541
Which we did not know before.

1087
02:04:37,442 --> 02:04:39,478
And not good news.

1088
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:42,645
How can you still call them humans?

1089
02:04:43,946 --> 02:04:45,983
And what are they?

1090
02:04:50,184 --> 02:04:53,723
I do not like the way you
connect such monsters with us.

1091
02:04:55,024 --> 02:04:55,889
Mengele.

1092
02:05:24,606 --> 02:05:28,106
Would Herr doctor like to
hear any particular music?

1093
02:06:23,524 --> 02:06:24,424
"Kapo"

1094
02:06:31,126 --> 02:06:32,058
Doctor.

1095
02:06:33,959 --> 02:06:39,912
These are the bracelet and the
posthumous flag of its director.

1096
02:06:40,313 --> 02:06:42,821
They must remain undisturbed.

1097
02:06:46,123 --> 02:06:47,205
In memoriam.

1098
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:12,706
If the Herr Doctor allows me to.

1099
02:07:15,652 --> 02:07:17,694
The orchestra is determined to

1100
02:07:17,695 --> 02:07:20,928
Interpret with our greater capacity

1101
02:07:21,038 --> 02:07:24,105
In the memory of our
beloved director.

1102
02:07:26,406 --> 02:07:29,914
I can assure you, Dr.
We are ready

1103
02:07:29,915 --> 02:07:32,623
To devote all the necessary time

1104
02:07:32,624 --> 02:07:34,422
To perfect the way we play.

1105
02:07:34,423 --> 02:07:38,954
We believe that our late leader
would have wanted us to continue.

1106
02:07:38,955 --> 02:07:43,162
Let us move forward,

1107
02:07:43,163 --> 02:07:45,949
She has inspired us.

1108
02:08:38,268 --> 02:08:41,268
... rehearse and rehearse and rehearse,

1109
02:08:41,269 --> 02:08:46,549
We must not touch until
we can do it right.

1110
02:08:53,251 --> 02:08:56,422
Yes, we should not
do that again...

1111
02:08:56,423 --> 02:08:58,352
You should not have...

1112
02:08:59,658 --> 02:09:01,684
I had never been... Fania...

1113
02:09:06,859 --> 02:09:08,252
Oh, Mandel.

1114
02:09:30,931 --> 02:09:33,512
You can play Mme Butterfly,

1115
02:09:35,914 --> 02:09:39,408
You and the others.

1116
02:10:24,744 --> 02:10:27,745
We are ready to begin,
Frau Lagerfuhrerin

1117
02:10:30,646 --> 02:10:32,686
We are ready to begin.

1118
02:10:36,688 --> 02:10:39,772
Is it something that
happened to the boy?

1119
02:10:51,871 --> 02:10:55,821
It has always been said that
the greatness of the people,

1120
02:10:55,822 --> 02:10:58,720
Depends on the sacrifices
they are willing to make.

1121
02:11:01,921 --> 02:11:04,016
I gave him back.

1122
02:11:13,343 --> 02:11:14,095
Let's go now,

1123
02:11:15,344 --> 02:11:16,907
Touch for me.

1124
02:11:22,209 --> 02:11:23,629
Play for me.

1125
02:14:28,572 --> 02:14:31,572
Musicians, we'll start the rehearsal.

1126
02:14:34,174 --> 02:14:36,187
I order you to rehearse.

1127
02:14:37,188 --> 02:14:38,896
It is the Russian artillery,

1128
02:14:38,897 --> 02:14:42,369
I am in charge, and I have not given
permission to suspend trials.

1129
02:14:42,370 --> 02:14:45,443
Stupid, it's all over.
You do not get it!

1130
02:14:45,944 --> 02:14:47,957
It's the Russians
out there, Olga.

1131
02:14:47,958 --> 02:14:51,859
And we probably "gas"
Before they can get here.

1132
02:14:51,860 --> 02:14:54,656
Relax, we can not
rehearse in the dark.

1133
02:14:54,657 --> 02:14:56,825
She can in any case
carry the baton.

1134
02:14:56,826 --> 02:14:58,374
Stop grilling potatoes,

1135
02:14:58,375 --> 02:14:59,836
What are you thinking?

1136
02:14:59,837 --> 02:15:01,367
I order you to come with me.

1137
02:15:02,569 --> 02:15:03,511
Stop.

1138
02:15:04,112 --> 02:15:04,995
Sit down.

1139
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:06,518
The Germans leave tonight.

1140
02:15:06,519 --> 02:15:07,649
I do not see why.

1141
02:15:07,650 --> 02:15:11,411
We'll be released, silly.
We survived.

1142
02:15:12,612 --> 02:15:16,138
He's trying to get an
orchestra to direct,

1143
02:15:16,139 --> 02:15:17,371
But the war must end.

1144
02:16:00,656 --> 02:16:02,657
I was supposed to be free, or something.

1145
02:16:30,757 --> 02:16:31,558
I believe that...

1146
02:16:32,659 --> 02:16:33,685
I should applaud...

1147
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:36,205
he...

1148
02:16:41,507 --> 02:16:42,968
I believe that...

1149
02:16:44,269 --> 02:16:45,775
Have you seen him?

1150
02:16:51,077 --> 02:16:51,916
Do not.

1151
02:17:24,917 --> 02:17:26,906
I want you to have this,

1152
02:17:27,207 --> 02:17:28,627
It's my diary.

1153
02:17:30,328 --> 02:17:34,692
I can not do this.
I know you'll live, Fania, I know.

1154
02:17:34,693 --> 02:17:36,457
I assure you that I want to live,

1155
02:17:36,458 --> 02:17:38,653
I feel something
terrible is happening.

1156
02:18:52,213 --> 02:18:53,714
Where are we going?

1157
02:18:54,815 --> 02:18:56,339
Where are they taking us?

1158
02:19:17,454 --> 02:19:18,354
Sonya!

1159
02:19:19,455 --> 02:19:21,460
Fania, I can not go on.

1160
02:19:27,362 --> 02:19:29,385
How is every soldier doing?

1161
02:19:31,587 --> 02:19:34,320
Can you tell me
where they lead us?

1162
02:19:36,465 --> 02:19:38,514
Because wherever it is

1163
02:19:38,515 --> 02:19:41,556
It's like making a guy
forget his problems.

1164
02:19:42,885 --> 02:19:44,934
Where do we go?

1165
02:19:44,935 --> 02:19:46,686
Who knows?
- Truly?

1166
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,983
I think it's so they do not fall
into the hands of the Russians.

1167
02:19:49,984 --> 02:19:53,103
They would tell them what they did to them.

1168
02:19:56,004 --> 02:19:57,497
Are they going to kill us?

1169
02:19:57,498 --> 02:19:58,775
Do not ask me.

1170
02:20:03,877 --> 02:20:06,409
I make you "Kappo", keep them together,

1171
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:08,056
Follow that path and take care of the bombs,

1172
02:20:08,057 --> 02:20:09,904
The commanders will
be in charge later.

1173
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Fania!

1174
02:20:23,001 --> 02:20:23,743
Where are you?

1175
02:21:27,752 --> 02:21:28,572
Fania...

1176
02:21:30,573 --> 02:21:34,663
Try to keep your eyes

1177
02:21:35,764 --> 02:21:38,724
Open if you can.

1178
02:23:11,177 --> 02:23:12,759
You have to live Fania.

1179
02:25:13,225 --> 02:25:17,225
Could it be possible for you
to say something to the press?

1180
02:25:20,327 --> 02:25:22,411
It is very important to me.

1181
02:26:06,726 --> 02:26:08,726
<i>Let us march, children of the country,</i>

1182
02:26:14,376 --> 02:26:16,376
<i>That the day of glory has arrived</i>

1183
02:26:19,378 --> 02:26:22,439
We have faced tyranny,

1184
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,573
Our bloody flag

1185
02:26:26,574 --> 02:26:28,100
Es ized.

1186
02:26:33,202 --> 02:26:36,781
Do you understand me comrades?

1187
02:26:40,583 --> 02:26:44,471
When you reach men be soldiers

1188
02:26:45,682 --> 02:26:48,188
They will fall into our arms,

1189
02:26:49,589 --> 02:26:54,069
To kill, to kill completely!

1190
02:26:55,571 --> 02:26:58,034
To arms, comrades!

1191
02:26:58,035 --> 02:27:00,373
Form brigades!

1192
02:27:03,075 --> 02:27:06,263
On the go, on the go,

1193
02:27:08,139 --> 02:27:10,208
Do not be afraid.

1194
02:27:14,010 --> 02:27:15,936
For a much higher ideal.
