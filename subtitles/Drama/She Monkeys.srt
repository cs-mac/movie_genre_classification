Come on.

171
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,161
This is incredible.

172
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:24,797
We actually altered the future.

173
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,599
This is a different 2044.

174
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,267
Yes.

175
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:30,536
But we still remember the old one.

176
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:32,371
It's the injections that we have taken.

177
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,774
They render our bodies and consciousness

178
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,475
impervious to the changes of time.

179
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:40,313
Time shifted around us,
and altered our reality.

180
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,881
Look.

181
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:45,051
The plague now
started in 2018, not in 2016.

182
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,119
And because of you,

183
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,855
the CDC knew and were
better prepared for the outbreak.

184
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,490
Lives were saved.

185
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,360
Not all of them, but some.

186
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:55,995
Perhaps hundreds of thousands.

187
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,297
But it's strange.

188
00:11:58,365 --> 00:12:01,701
With more time and more lives saved,

189
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,036
the potential for change is exponential.

190
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,839
Yet here we are, on the same course.

191
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,308
The people here
have no idea what we did.

192
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,877
No, for them nothing changed.

193
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,679
This is their reality.

194
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,147
Not ours.

195
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,482
We are late arrivals.

196
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,551
I had to investigate
our own investigation.

197
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,687
And as far as I can tell,
only you, Mr. Ramse, and I

198
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,456
are aware that anything is different.

199
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,324
And presumably Mr. Cole,

200
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:27,093
but we'll know once we retrieve him.

201
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,562
Cole has abandoned the mission.

202
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,432
He's emotionally compromised.

203
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,435
Ramse, now Jennifer.

204
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,904
Are you sure?

205
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:40,673
I'm sure.

206
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:43,909
We should move on without him.

207
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:48,047
So we stopped the
virus, but it still happened.

208
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:51,183
Well, it is possible that

209
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:52,451
when the Messengers used our machine

210
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,153
to go back in time,

211
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,855
that somehow they ensured

212
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,456
the eventual release of the plague.

213
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,058
We need to get

214
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,127
Mr. Ramse to talk.

215
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:03,062
[chair screeching]

216
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,830
It is so good to see you, my friend.

217
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:09,969
Jonesy and Cass, they got
a real nasty beef with you.

218
00:13:10,037 --> 00:13:12,938
Worse than our little
piece of unfinished business.

219
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:15,207
They sent me in here to crack you.

220
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,309
They keep going on and
on about Messengers this,

221
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,445
12 Monkeys that.

222
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:21,080
They think you know something.

223
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:24,617
Like where they went... when they went.

224
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,285
What they want with our machine.

225
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:27,753
Your machine?

226
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:28,954
I know, I know.

227
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:31,624
You tell Jones...

228
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,627
I don't know
anything about the Messengers.

229
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,563
I can't help her.

230
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,166
Oh...

231
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:44,103
[chuckling] Oh, boy, oh, boy.

232
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,971
Yeah, I was hoping that
you would say that

233
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:48,774
because I gotta get
something out of you.

234
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:52,144
<i>Cole: We need to find a place,</i>

235
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,913
<i>get off the road,</i>

236
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,682
find a phone, get a message to 2044.

237
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,604
You know that's not how call
forwarding works, right?

238
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,120
Ramse had a tracker in him.

239
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,348
What about you, you have one?

240
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,622
I don't know.

241
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,990
I get poked and prodded a lot.

242
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:07,359
<i>[whispers in Jennifer's head]</i>

243
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,761
<i>607.</i>

244
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:10,029
Stop!

245
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:11,630
[brakes screeching]

246
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:13,132
The Emerson Hotel.

247
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,634
- Jennifer!
- This is it!

248
00:14:17,571 --> 00:14:20,139
They got phones, come on!

249
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,375
Yes, this is good.

250
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:24,777
Yes. You've been here before.

251
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:25,945
No, I haven't.

252
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,014
Yes, you have. Yes, you have.

253
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:30,149
They better let me use the phone.

254
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,484
Yes, you have.

255
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:32,551
You have!

256
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:34,019
Do me a favor.

257
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,154
Stop talking.

258
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,957
But you have.

259
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:40,793
Need to use the phone.

260
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,496
Amenities for customers only.

261
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:45,297
Then I need a room.

262
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:51,704
For how long?

263
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,672
I don't know. Does it have a phone?

264
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,074
You got a credit card or ID?

265
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,642
No.

266
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,744
No ID rate is $300.

267
00:14:58,812 --> 00:14:59,879
I need a name.

268
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,747
Morris.

269
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,716
- Last name?
- Morrison.

270
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,185
Morris Morrison.

271
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,186
[muttering] Mr. Morris Morrison.

272
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:08,654
Mr. Morris Morrison,

273
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:10,189
check out time is by 10:00 a.m.

274
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,324
No smoke or fires of any kind.

275
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,493
You break it, you buy it.

276
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:16,695
So if you break it, you have to buy it.

277
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:18,123
That's basically what he's saying.

278
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:20,099
Your key. Room 210.

279
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,001
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

280
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,003
No good. No, prime. No.
He needs a prime number.

281
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,271
- Something like 607.
- No, really, that's fine.

282
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,906
Don't need a prime number.

283
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,133
- It's okay.
- Yes... no, we do.

284
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,009
Room 607 is a private residence.

285
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,277
- It's not available.
- We don't need 607.

286
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,878
- 210 is what I got.
- 210's fine.

287
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,906
Okay, no, well maybe
we'll speak to the manager...

288
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,048
- 210's fine, thank you.
- 'cause we need a prime number.

289
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,082
210 is fine.

290
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,918
Elevator's over there.

291
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,086
I'd double bag it with that one!

292
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:44,256
This is wrong. This isn't... what?

293
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,892
What room did you give them?

294
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,427
210.

295
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,100
Come on.

296
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:56,268
No.

297
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,304
This isn't right.

298
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,045
Ask for the manager.

299
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:07,079
<i>Hello?</i>

300
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,747

<i>James Cole?</i>

302
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,483
I thought we agreed that you were not

00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:12,871
to contact me again in this time.

304
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:15,554
We did, we did, but things have changed.

305
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:16,956
<i>An event altering your timeline?</i>

306
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:18,057
Yeah.

307
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:18,757
<i>Why?</i>

308
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:19,905
Because it got complicated.

309
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,126
Cole, things are changing.

310
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:23,963
Stop it. Go sit down.

311
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,766
<i>Olivia: You have a purpose, Jennifer.</i>

312
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,973
You have a purpose, Jennifer.

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,077
<i>There is nothing more
important than this.</i>

314
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,280
I need you to write a
note in your journal.

315
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:44,516
August 2044, come back and get me.

316
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:47,086
Send Railly with another injection.

317
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:48,787
Our agreement was made

318
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,923
to protect the
integrity of our timeline.

319
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,993
You... the future you... and Cassie,

320
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,828
you're gonna make a mistake.

321
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:56,862
You're gonna hurt someone.

322
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,130
<i>A friend.</i>

323
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,531
I cannot know these things.

324
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,841
It's the Emerson Hotel.

325
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,835
Remember to come back and get me.

326
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:03,535
Very well, you told me.

327
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,004
<i>So you are still there?</i>

328
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:05,771
Yeah.

329
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,632
<i>Well, then that's either</i>

330
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:09,341
because I'm unable to bring you back

331
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,776
or I'm choosing not to.

332
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:11,944
<i>Either way, if my understanding</i>

333

<i>of causality is correct,</i>

334
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:15,981

00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,108
Wait, wait, wait. Don't...
don't hang up.

337
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,429
<i>This is your purpose, Jennifer.</i>

338
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,903
Purpose. You have no purpose.

339
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:24,390
- Without me, you have nothing.
- Not anymore.

340
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,825
<i>Stop the voices.</i>

341
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:28,027
[glass shatters]

342
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:29,028
[Jennifer yelling]

343
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,729
Jennifer!

344
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:31,997
[yelling]

345
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,033
Jennifer!

346
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:37,903
Why didn't you let her kill me?

347
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:41,106
[grunting]

348
00:17:41,174 --> 00:17:43,776
You robbed me of my purpose!

349
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:46,245
If I can't have one, neither can you!

350
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:49,415
No, I'm sure of it. It
looks just like him.

351
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,016
James Cole.

352
00:17:59,055 --> 00:18:00,723
I'm so glad

353
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,058
that we have this time.

354
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,494
Do you remember

355
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:09,031
when we would go out and
raid survivor camps?

356
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:11,967
And you would get all judge-y? Right?

357
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:14,970
And you would call
me "thief" and "tyrant"

358
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:17,973
and "killer."

359
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,843
And then you team up with them

360
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,412
to create the plague

361
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,382
that destroys the world.

362
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:29,818
Help me understand.

363
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:33,422
My son...

364
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,991
He lives here.

365
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,094
I didn't want to erase this world

366
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:42,298
with him in it.

367
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,933
Aww.

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,405
Father... of... the... year.

369
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:54,543
You know a little
something about that, right?

370
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,612
Fathers?

371
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,785
You ever hear of a place

372
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:06,422
called New Rochelle, New York?

373
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,757
Wilmont Road?

374
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:16,899
A little blue house,

375
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,902
and it had white trim.

376
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,138
I was parked out front

377
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,975
back in, uh, 2013.

378
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,080
Heard a man and woman fighting inside

379
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:33,649
in the house.

380
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:36,485
He chases her out,

381
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:41,023
and, uh, grabs her hair.

382
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:45,094
Starts beating her up.

383
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:47,062
Two little boys run out,

384
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,100
you know, chasing after her.

385
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,002
And the oldest was crying,

386
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:55,104
and he... he kept on crying

387
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:57,006
even when the cops came

388
00:19:57,073 --> 00:20:00,075
and took his Daddy away.

389
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:08,851
Theodore William Deacon.

390
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,455
That was you.

391
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,094
I came to see you.

392
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:23,966
I wanted to see how
you became what you are.

393
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:28,437
You know, I think your daddy,

394
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:31,306
he would've gone all the way.

395
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:35,277
He would've killed your mom right there

396
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,846
if the cops hadn't come.

397
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:43,452
You should thank me

398
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,055
for calling them.

399
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,159
Are you mad, Deac,

400
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,362
that I saw you that day?

401
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,164
You cried.

402
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:58,133
Sad little boy.

403
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:07,376
You know what, Teddy?

404
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:09,978
All the talking...

405
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:15,184
Got me a little thirsty.

406
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,553
Move!

407
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:24,159
[yelling]

408
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:27,096
[gurgling]

409
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:30,999
Deacon! Deacon, stop, stop!

410
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,935
Stop it!

411
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:36,205
Temper, temper!

412
00:21:36,272 --> 00:21:38,707
Deac... Deacon.

413
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,209
You need to calm down.

414
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:42,010
Hey, shh.

415
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:44,179
Calm down.

416
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,115
[Deacon whimpers]

417
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:47,916
Breathe.

418
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:50,252
Look at me, look at me.

419
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,588
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:54,256
He knows about my father.

421
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:55,791
Hey.

422
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,259
He saw.

423
00:21:57,327 --> 00:21:59,762
He is just trying
to get under your skin.

424
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:03,932
[scoffs] Well, it worked.

425
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,035
He's not gonna talk.

426
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:09,104
We are gonna have to kill him.

427
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:11,039
No, no, no.

428
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,142
There's another way.

429
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:16,078
So you're saying you
changed our reality?

430
00:22:16,146 --> 00:22:17,045
No.

431
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:20,282
My timeline changed into this one.

432
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:21,416
The virus occurred earlier?

433
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:22,818
Right.

434
00:22:22,886 --> 00:22:25,554
And much worse than we remembered it?

435
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:26,789
Precisely.

436
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,791
But there were other changes as well,

437
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,292
at least from my perspective.

438
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,827
Spearhead, for example.

439
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:36,665
In my reality, we
invaded, confiscated their core,

440
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,173
and used it to continue our mission.

441
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:39,434
That happened.

442
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:42,971
And Dr. Lasky was killed.

443
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,973
Uh...

444
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:46,275
What?

445
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:47,843
I was killed?

446
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:49,912
Shot to death during the attempt

447
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,280
to commandeer Spearhead.

448
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:55,284
Well, then...

449
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,319
I prefer this reality.

450
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:00,322
So do I, Dr. Lasky.

451
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,125
I will need your help,

452
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:05,928
all of you, to fully understand
this timeline.

453
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:08,096
This will be all for
now. You're dismissed.

454
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,205
I need to have a word with you.

455
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:20,509
Is there anything you
wish to discuss, Dr. Eckland?

456
00:23:20,577 --> 00:23:23,445
You really don't remember me?

457
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,614
I read through some part of my journal,

458
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,349
and it looks like your expertise

459
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:31,386
in molecular biology was quite valuable.

460
00:23:31,454 --> 00:23:33,488
I apologize, Dr. Eckland,

461
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:36,325
but you were not part
of my original reality.

462
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:39,194
Well...

463
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:42,331
Well, that's going to make
it awkward tonight...

464
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:44,366
when you come to bed.

465
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,470
Whoa.

466
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,405
Déjà vu.

467
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:11,475
Happy Anniversary!

468
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,176
[laughing]

469
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,778
What are you doing?

470
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:18,415
I don't know anymore.

471
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:21,351
That's the problem!

472
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,819
I had a purpose.

473
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,588
You have a purpose, Jennifer.

474
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:28,291
Better living through mass extinction.

475
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,192
Kill the voices.

476
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,660
This plague will stop the voices.

477
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:32,262
You took it from me.

478
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,664
Who told you killing was your purpose?

479
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,301
Mothers to daughters.

480
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:40,370
Beautiful daughter.

481
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,306
They fill baths with water,

482
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:45,475
and they... soap and bubbles.

483
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:48,545
And they tell them that they're special.

484
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,013
You're special.

485
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,381
They say, "You have a purpose."

486
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,609
You have a purpose, Jennifer.

487
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,484
"You have a purpose."

488
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:57,487
It's not the killing.

489
00:24:57,555 --> 00:25:01,057
The killing part is sad,
and it's gross, but after...

490
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,293
No more voices. No more variables.

491
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:07,063
Jennifer, ending the world

492
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,401
is not gonna stop the
voices in your head.

493
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,036
Stop... Stop the voices.

494
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:16,072
Oh, no, that's not what Olivia said.

495
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,475
Trust me, Jennifer.

496
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:20,410
Kill the world,

497
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,246
and then it's silence.

498
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:27,517
Olivia...

499
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:30,320
That's the woman behind the 12 Monkeys.

500
00:25:30,388 --> 00:25:32,155
She said I was primary.

501
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:33,690
<i>You are primary.</i>

502
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:36,593
<i>- I'm important.
- You're special.</i>

503
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,729
You can see the changes
made in time, can't you?

504
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:43,400
The things I see.

505
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:45,669
<i>- I am time.
