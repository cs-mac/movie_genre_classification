1
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:27,214
All passengers of LOT flight
from Warsaw to London

2
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:34,721
are requested immediately
for to go to passport control

3
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,849
and custom clearance.

4
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,452
Before we left, customs
checked all our luggage.

5
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:02,833
That bag contained hammers
drills and an axe.

6
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:07,004
Today is the fifth
of December, 1981.

7
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:10,257
Warsaw black market exchanges
one pound sterling

8
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,595
for well over 1,000 zloty,
the average weekly wage.

9
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:20,851
I landed in London with 1,200
pounds in my pocket.

10
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:25,981
A sum that would have taken
me 25 years to earn.

11
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,108
The purpose of our visit
to London is to buy

12
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:31,570
a second-hand car with
our joint savings.

13
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,197
The purpose of our visit
to London is to buy

14
00:02:34,406 --> 00:02:37,868
a second-hand car with
our joint savings.

15
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:44,166
It was very difficult
to disguise the weight

16
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,793
of our hand luggage.

17
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,005
As my men didn't know
a single word of English,

18
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,757
I would have to speak
for them all.

19
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,508
Number four.

20
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,096
The purpose of our visit
to London is to buy

21
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:00,891
a second-hand car with
our joint savings.

22
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,143
How many are there
of you?

23
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:04,728
We are...

24
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:08,482
We are four...people.

25
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,985
I have the passports.

26
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,112
How much money have
you brought with you?

27
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,114
Twelve hundred pounds.

28
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,664
And where will you
be staying?

29
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:28,001
We are staying in a flat
in Onslow Gardens, number 5.

30
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:32,506
It is a friend
of my wife.

31
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,471
You must make absolutely sure
that your friends understand

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,517
exactly what this
is about.

33
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,686
"Leave to remain in
the United Kingdom

34
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,480
on condition that the holder
does not engage in employment

35
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,274
paid or unpaid, and does
not engage in any

36
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:55,862
business or profession is
hereby given for one month."

37
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,409
Now do you understand
that, Mr. Nowak?

38
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,243
Nov-ak.

39
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:05,038
Yes, I understand.

40
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:06,331
Thank you.

41
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,252
Mr. Wolski.

42
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,428
Mr. Bana-zak?

43
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:21,221
Banaszak.

44
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:33,066
Mr. Kudaj?

45
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,860
Ku-day.

46
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:49,624
Are you a member
of Solidarity?

47
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,376
No.

48
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,090
That was the only true
answer I gave him.

49
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,583
Where did you get
those trolleys, please?

50
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:35,253
Where did you get
the trolley?

51
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:36,046
Take this.

52
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,047
Oh!

53
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:37,714
This is for you.

54
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,925
Thank you, bless you.

55
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:47,766
Idiot Banaszak!

56
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:56,483
Your attention please,
will Mr. David Ellis

57
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,985
please contact
airport information.

58
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:02,864
Mr. David Ellis, please
contact airport information.

59
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:30,183
Today's Times page five:

60
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:33,103
"At her concert in Warsaw's
ice hockey stadium last night

61
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:36,731
American pop star Tina Turner
was determined that politics

62
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,776
be left alone despite
the current climate of freedom

63
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:43,738
so that Poles could concentrate
on her athletic charms

64
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,366
and gold lamay
nickel skirt.

65
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:49,369
However, the audience began
to warm up when they realized

66
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:53,540
that her song titles could
conceal political meaning.

67
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,459
'What do you want?'
she asked suggestively.

68
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,503
'Food!' shouted
the audience.

69
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:01,840
'What do you need?' she
repeated equally provocatively.

70
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,592
'Dollars!'"

71
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,930
We were there only
last night.

72
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,726
The boss took us
and our wives as a treat.

73
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:17,898
Anna was sitting between
the boss and me.

74
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,428
And that's another two
quid for the baggage!

75
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:02,609
Good morning,
can I help you?

76
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,527
Yes, I have...

77
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,488
Oh, yeah.

78
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,578
Yes, well that's fine,
I'll just get the keys.

79
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,420
There you are.

80
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,090
Two keys.

81
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:26,216
Two keys for
the one door?

82
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,802
Yeah, I'm sure
you'll manage.

83
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,763
Thank you.

84
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,099
It's nice to see you.

85
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:37,185
It's my very pleasure
to meet you.

86
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,528
I made it clear,
no smoking.

87
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:31,406
I hate the smell
of cigarette smoke.

88
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,699
Oh, f---!

89
00:10:51,486 --> 00:10:55,949
Ladies, don't settle for
anything but the real thing.

90
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:59,327
Spaghetti Rigatoni in the
traditional blue paper pack

91
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,037
at our delicatessen.

92
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:05,416
Don't hesitate,
only 38p.

93
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,394
Ladies, does your husband
come home tired and irritable?

94
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:29,149
A can of Party Four will keep
him sweet at home all evening!

95
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:33,653
Party Four 2 pounds 40
in our office.

96
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:09,689
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,858
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

98
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,111
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,488
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,828
Coca Cola!

101
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,038
Coca Cola!

102
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:34,047
Nowak, here mini Cola!

103
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,998
Rita, how much is the
Kitty Cat turkey flavor?

104
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,042
Twenty-six pence,
I think.

105
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,463
You are intending to pay
for the goods concealed

106
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,298
in your handbag, madam?

107
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:18,925
Oh, I didn't really
mean to take...

108
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,262
It's our policy
to prosecute shop lifters.

109
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,222
I think we should go
to the manager's office.

110
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,224
Please, just put it
back on the shelf.

111
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:30,937
I really didn't mean
to take it.

112
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,855
It happens
all the time.

113
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,947
This way, this way
officer!

114
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:49,140
Nowak, come get!

115
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,805
Banaszak...

116
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,646
You just wait!

117
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,702
Thank you.

118
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,064
Hello?

119
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:13,701
Moment.

120
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,245
It was as simple
as the boss said.

121
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,874
The line for Warsaw
was better than in Warsaw.

122
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,795
If our conversation was taped,
it must be a good recording.

123
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,256
I confirmed that everything
was okay,

124
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,467
still the boss insisted
that every detail

125
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,594
should go into his
black notebook.

126
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,221
'Just for the record,'
he said.

127
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,733
Stop, stop.

128
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,043
Okay.

129
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,546
As instructed by the boss,
knocking the walls down

130
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:11,592
until 8pm selecting
usable materials until 11pm.

131
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:14,220
To bed at midnight.

132
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,767
The men are not to know
what I know,

133
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,395
but by sending work men
over from Poland

134
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,981
and paying our wages
in zlotys,

135
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,233
our boss can have
his London house down

136
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,318
for a quarter of what
he would have to pay

137
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,154
a British builder.

138
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:35,116
Don't they ever wonder why
the bosses prepare to pay

139
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:38,077
for one months hard labor
what it would take us

140
00:18:38,286 --> 00:18:40,997
a year to earn
in Warsaw?

141
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:44,875
And the bonus are 20 pounds
each when the job is done.

142
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:48,963
The magic of hard currency,
our boss is one of the few

143
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,716
in Poland who has dollars.

144
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,301
Sleep well Anna.

145
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,896
Sunday mass at
the Polish church.

146
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:49,857
Bus fare 20 pence each...

147
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:53,444
to come out of
the entertainment money.

148
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:55,780
A television.

149
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:13,065
Twenty pounds
for entertainment,

150
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:16,235
nearly one pound
gone already.

151
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:19,905
An evening out when
the rest were easily got.

152
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:22,324
I had a better idea.

153
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,453
We took a vote on it,
Kudaj was against.

154
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,876
Can I help you?

155
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:36,005
Nice set, sir,
only 50 pounds, very cheap.

156
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,758
Forty pounds is all
I have, no more.

157
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,886
Forty pounds fully
guaranteed 26 inch

158
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,512
color television set?

159
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:45,765
Sir, I can see you have
a nice sense of humor

160
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,058
but please, let us
be serious.

161
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,193
Forty pounds without
the guarantee.

162
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,739
Cash?

163
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:12,792
Forty pounds,
no guarantee, no aerial.

164
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,046
Forty pounds,
without the guarantee,

165
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,424
and with the aerial.

166
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:24,178
Forty pounds without
guarantee with aerial.

167
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:29,099
And no plug!

168
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,605
To buy it I added
my 20 pound bonus

169
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:36,816
to the entertainment fund.

170
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:40,152
Anna has been asking
me for a color TV.

171
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:05,052
Liverpool's still got the upper
hand in this half.

172
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,309
Oh, and my god what
a terrible mistake!

173
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:20,818
Out to Robertson.

174
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:30,494
Inside Hugh McDonald
and...

175
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,264
Anderson brings it down
takes it down to Wing.

176
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,079
Beaten down by Walden!

177
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,324
I repair the TV
in Warsaw.

178
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,118
All the better, no time
will be wasted.

179
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,326
I can see you believe
in working hard

180
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,744
Sunday or no Sunday.

181
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,162
Oh it's perfectly
all right with me,

182
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,748
Just carry on,
if you must.

183
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,835
I only hope the other
residents won't complain.

184
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:43,627
You don't mind?

185
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,212
Oh no, no I don't mind.

186
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:54,596
It was very like
my boss in Warsaw

187
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,140
even dresses like that.

188
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:57,641
Ah yes,
him over there.

189
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,810
He always comes
around on Sunday.

190
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,395
When the cat's away,
you know?

191
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:34,303
People like a bit
of peace and quiet!

192
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:47,775
There...that's better.

193
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:50,277
Almost acceptable.

194
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,657
I can speak their language,
this is why the boss

195
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,077
choose me for the job.

196
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,913
But I don't know
what they really mean.

197
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,605
Sign that.

198
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,504
Damn you!

199
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,090
Come on, boy,
come on.

200
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:19,700
So, this isn't the only
house full of rubbish

201
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,243
'round here.

202
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,425
Good morning.

203
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,760
Oh, good morning.

204
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,596
I see some English
work harder at night

205
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,473
then Poles onto Sunday.

206
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,934
Yes, quite.

207
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,593
Couple parts will
be in tomorrow.

208
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,928
When?

209
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,679
Tomorrow.

210
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,849
Trade?

211
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:27,559
Master electrician.

212
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,565
Trade or private?

213
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,194
I almost forgot
the business card

214
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,946
the boss had printed
in order to obtain

215
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,989
professional discount.

216
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,377
Eagle Builders.

217
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:29,329
Anna's face could look at me
from every shop window.

218
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,417
wherever they sell
those clothes.

219
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,463
Maybe I could involve
that girl.

220
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:46,013
I have to go that way
for copper pipe anyway.

221
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,684
The girl seemed
to be nice,

222
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,937
girls are always attracted
to men who have pretty women.

223
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,865
Oh, damnit.

224
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,825
The photograph.

225
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,586
Can I help you, sir?

226
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,088
I'm just looking
around.

227
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:21,465
Okay.

228
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,094
Thank you very
much, good bye.

229
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,976
Excuse me.

230
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:36,897
I was--I was looking
at you through

231
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,190
the window yesterday.

232
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:41,693
Can I help you?

233
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,029
I have a great
publicity idea

234
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,199
for Wrangler.

235
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:50,035
Look, you see this
poster here, it's good.

236
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,787
It's too small.

237
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,589
It's a good poster,
but what about sweatshirts?

238
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:03,882
Well, I've got lots
of sweatshirts here.

239
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:08,637
Would you like--

240
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:09,805
Huh?

241
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,807
Whenever I show this photo
to my friends in Poland

242
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:15,227
they say, "Where did
you get the sweatshirt?"

243
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,770
Well, wouldn't it
make a great

244
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,855
Wrangler poster?

245
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,857
Hmm, it's very nice.

246
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,068
You want a sweatshirt
for her?

247
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,826
So much for daydreams.

248
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,325
You're wasting time.

249
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,369
Aw, come on.

250
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:16,496
Look, just come on!

251
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:20,959
I was sure it was
only five to three,

252
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,420
but Kudaj's watch
says ten past.

253
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,213
Did somebody telephone?

254
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,965
Yes indeed,
I just did.

255
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,008
It is working.

256
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,426
No, whatever,
I mean from Warsaw.

257
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:30,844
It's ringing.

258
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,387
Excuse me.

259
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:56,203
Banaszak.

260
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,498
Barbara!

261
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,876
"I'm well," he says.

262
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,378
"It's going well here.

263
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,048
I hope you and the kids
are keeping well.

264
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,760
I think about you
all the time."

265
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:13,345
I wish I could
be like him.

266
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,639
By the way I do think
about Anna all the time.

267
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,641
I never stop!

268
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:27,692
Nowak.

269
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:28,902
Anna?

270
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,671
Three glasses of vodka she's
had with the boss already.

271
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,965
How many more
will they have?

272
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,425
Why did he really
choose me?

273
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:04,229
They have agreed
to miss church today.

274
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:06,731
We'll fall behind
otherwise.

275
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:22,080
I must talk to Anna,
I can't wait until Saturday.

276
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:48,648
Which country?

277
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:49,899
Warsaw, Poland.

278
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,611
All the lines
have been suspended.

279
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:53,862
Suspended, why?

280
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,988
There was a military coup.

281
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,239
A coup?

282
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:59,451
That's right, didn't
you hear the news?

283
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,592
Yes, I know.

284
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,678
I want to make an
airline reservation

285
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:01,554
for tomorrow's flight
to Warsaw.

286
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:03,807
I'm afraid, sir,
all air traffic to Poland

287
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,600
has been stopped.

288
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,810
Till when?

289
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:08,269
I have no idea, sir,
I'm afraid we're

290
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,647
just as much in the dark
about what's happening there

291
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:11,564
as everybody else.

292
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:12,649
Sorry, sir.

293
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,071
Well...

294
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:22,742
How will you take
the news, Banaszak?

295
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,663
No more phone calls
from Barbara.

296
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,291
No flights home until
God knows when.

297
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,420
No boss, only me.

298
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,983
I'm not afraid,
I'm quite calm.

299
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,901
Thing is, I've not had
a clear thought in my head

300
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,278
since yesterday.

301
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,724
A government proclamation
banned a wide-range

302
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:29,309
of civil liberties.

303
00:38:29,517 --> 00:38:32,020
A 10pm to 6am curfew
was introduced.

304
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,189
Polish soldiers patrol
the streets of Warsaw

305
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,357
in battle gear,
telephone and telex lines

306
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:39,068
for outside world
were all cut yesterday.

307
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:49,204
They sleep soundly,
they don't know.

308
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:50,914
Let them sleep.

309
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,926
Oh, two for Banaszak,
he likes his coffee strong.

310
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:12,727
Wake up!

311
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,779
Wake up!

312
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:26,991
Wake up!

313
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,802
Hey, I say...

314
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:52,183
Have you seen the news
in the paper?

315
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,935
Must be extremely
upsetting to you

316
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,061
what's happening
in Poland.

317
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,939
Yes, it is ver--
it is very upsetting.

318
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:18,251
Why are you doing that?

319
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,878
Why?
There's too much
on there, pal,

320
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:21,254
get some of it off.

321
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,339
It's not--it's not
my rubbish.

322
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,300
You pay 40 pound
for one load,

323
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:26,301
not for six loads.

324
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,552
Get some of it off!

325
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,847
But it was the people,
it was the neighbors here.

326
00:40:31,055 --> 00:40:32,307
I'm the geezer driving
the wagon,

327
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:34,100
I'll go up the road,
I'll get nicked!

328
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,435
Get it off!

329
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:36,936
We've had enough
of you people.

330
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,230
Because the people,
it was--I was shaving

331
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,566
I looked out of the window
and it was here!

332
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:43,484
It's not my rubbish!

333
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:42,502
Oi!

334
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,587
Get your own skiff!

335
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,839
Get your own skiff!

336
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:52,470
You lazy scruffy
rat-faced, rat-eared,

337
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,430
cobble-eyed maggot!

338
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,766
Just because you
come over here

339
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,310
Raffie knows
you're a Commie,

340
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,231
it don't mean you wipe
your ass on our flag.

341
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,091
Those are told by
the authorities

342
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:33,344
that the west is reacting
calmly to the weekend crackdown.

343
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:35,471
"Those who diluted themselves
of the introduction

344
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,390
of Marshall Law in Poland
would bring about

345
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,559
a political earthquake
all over the globe

346
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:42,979
have been disappointed," said
a Warsaw television reporter.

347
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:45,690
The broadcast said that
on the whole, western statesmen

348
00:42:45,898 --> 00:42:48,192
and influential propaganda
centers have adopted

349
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:51,571
at least a restrainer
during two events in Poland.

350
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:22,620
I'm sure the boss
would take care of Anna.

351
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,210
Unless he's been
locked up.

352
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:50,189
'Scuse me, sir,
that's not your paper.

353
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:52,733
This is yours, sorry.

354
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,703
The first initial bloodshed
by the Polish authorities

355
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:06,080
since the military takeover
was reported last night

356
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:07,498
that seven workers
had been killed

357
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:10,418
and 39 injured in a clash
south of the country.

358
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:13,045
Polish television news
reporter wearing an army uniform

359
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:15,131
said that the soldiers
had no choice.

360
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,925
They were under attack
and forced to shoot.

361
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:27,935
I must concentrate
on work.

362
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:30,563
I must drive them harder.

363
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:35,818
Stabilizers should've
been sprayed on yesterday.

364
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:38,196
We must start
the plumbing tomorrow.

365
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:42,575
Three days without water,
it won't be easy.

366
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,536
I must allow them
time for a bath.

367
00:47:28,723 --> 00:47:30,433
I'll tell them now.

368
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:01,672
--Concrete cells,
no furniture,

369
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:05,551
food, water,
toilets or heat.

370
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:16,270
All I could say
was, "Who smoked?"

371
00:50:20,811 --> 00:50:21,604
Top, top,
on top!

372
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:22,646
Top, top, top,
top, top, top!

373
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:24,231
Banaszak.

374
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,527
Kudaj.

375
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:53,469
Nowak!

376
00:50:53,677 --> 00:50:54,595
Nowak!

377
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:10,361
Nowak, Nowak!

378
00:51:14,949 --> 00:51:17,868
Nowak!

379
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:54,947
It should have been
a great day for us.

380
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,032
All the new joints leaked.

381
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,867
And neither
I nor Banaszak

382
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:00,744
have any idea what
has gone wrong.

383
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:02,121
It has set us
days behind,

384
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:05,416
and I don't know
how many pounds short.

385
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,876
That made them forget
the weekend phone call.

386
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:13,632
I'll have to wait
until Monday

387
00:52:13,841 --> 00:52:15,926
to find out what went
wrong with the joints.

388
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,073
I said that everything
at home was alright,

389
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:39,491
their wives send
their love,

390
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,536
Banaszak's lady wants
some Beyer aspirin.

391
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:46,582
They'll all ring again
next Saturday.

392
00:52:49,209 --> 00:52:50,961
I think they
believe me.

393
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,652
It's not true I never
finish a job!

394
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,820
That I always fail!

395
00:53:17,029 --> 00:53:18,822
Not this time!

396
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:20,366
I'll show them.

397
00:53:20,574 --> 00:53:22,284
Anna, the boss.

398
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,535
Seventy-two pound
for new joints.

399
00:54:46,744 --> 00:54:49,246
He said we must've
overheated them.

400
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:02,760
There's no way I can
find 72 pounds.

401
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:05,721
No more beer but I can't
cut down on food.

402
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,347
Pack those too.

403
00:55:07,556 --> 00:55:09,141
Have you paid
for them madam?

404
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,101
That's the second time
I've been asked that.

405
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,269
I certainly have.

406
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:14,354
See your receipt then
please, madam.

407
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,861
Go on,
it's okay.

408
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,450
So that's it.

409
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:28,160
With a receipt
you're okay.

410
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:44,426
Sir, 1.56 please.

411
00:55:44,635 --> 00:55:46,512
One pound fifty-six.

412
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,722
May I have a carrier bag?

413
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,125
This is Radio Moscow,
broadcasting

414
00:57:40,334 --> 00:57:42,461
for Great Britain
and Ireland.

415
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:55,265
Okay,

416
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,797
Banaszak.

417
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:55,242
We'll have to work
18 hours a day now

418
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,369
to finish the job.

419
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,913
I'll pay them with food
they can take home.

420
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,336
They've slept
three hours

421
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:08,922
after working
all night.

422
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,924
To make them
feel better

423
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:13,093
I'll tell them
it was five.

424
00:59:21,852 --> 00:59:25,022
The only watch that
works now is mine.

425
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:30,402
Wake up!

426
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,252
It is Christmas Eve,

427
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,463
and I have not slept
for three nights.

428
00:59:56,595 --> 00:59:59,389
I can't make
a mistake now.

429
00:59:59,598 --> 01:00:01,183
Or Christmas
will be ruined.

430
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:13,653
That's 52 pence change.

431
01:00:13,862 --> 01:00:15,614
Excuse me, I bought
this turkey here

432
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:18,075
this morning, my friends
also have a turkey.

433
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:20,619
Is it possible you could
take it back for me.

434
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:21,495
I'll have to ask
a manager,

435
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:23,038
if you can wait
a minute.

436
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:29,461
Kid over there's free
if you want to go over.

437
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,057
Yes, Rita,
what's the problem?

438
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,225
It's this gentleman, sir.

439
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:44,684
Can I help you, sir?

440
01:00:44,893 --> 01:00:46,061
I'm sorry.

441
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:48,647
I bought this here
some time ago,

442
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:50,440
it's a turkey.

443
01:00:50,649 --> 01:00:51,775
My friends also
bought one,

444
01:00:51,983 --> 01:00:52,651
we have two,
I wonder,

445
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:53,652
may I return this?

446
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,612
May I have a word
with you, Mr. Rogers?

447
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:03,703
Not for a moment,
Mrs. Rostrom.

448
01:01:03,912 --> 01:01:06,998
Did your friends buy
the other turkey here?

449
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:08,583
No.

450
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:11,962
Well why don't they
return theirs?

451
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,923
Theirs is fresh,
this is frozen.

452
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:16,591
Well actually, sir,
it isn't our policy

453
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,635
to make refunds.

454
01:01:18,844 --> 01:01:20,762
I, I--

455
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:23,181
Oh, let me see
the receipt, sir.

456
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,987
Well...they tell me
that it's Christmas.

457
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:41,283
Rita, would you give
this gentlemen

458
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:42,909
seven pound,
fifty back please?

459
01:01:46,037 --> 01:01:48,373
Actually you'd have been
having a late lunch, sir.

460
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:52,127
These things take
24 hours to defrost.

461
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:54,087
Well, merry Christmas
to you.

462
01:01:56,631 --> 01:01:57,465
Sir?

463
01:01:57,674 --> 01:01:58,091
Yes?

464
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,134
Merry Christmas.

465
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:04,097
Merry Christmas.

466
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:20,739
The Quiet Life.

467
01:02:20,947 --> 01:02:26,494
Or Sleep Complete.

468
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:28,622
Which is the cheaper?

469
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,165
Quiet Life.

470
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:39,633
Did I leave
the door open?

471
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:53,104
Kudaj?

472
01:02:53,313 --> 01:02:54,814
Banaszak?

473
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:56,358
Wolski?

474
01:07:37,764 --> 01:07:40,475
We all worked right
through Christmas.

475
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:43,102
And Saturday the 26th
we took turns waiting

476
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:45,355
for the telephone call
from Warsaw,

477
01:07:45,563 --> 01:07:47,815
which I knew
would never come.

478
01:08:11,506 --> 01:08:12,924
Nowak!

479
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:14,759
Nowak!

480
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:16,553
Nowak!

481
01:08:26,854 --> 01:08:29,148
Banaszak?

482
01:09:25,163 --> 01:09:26,456
That damn Kudaj
still waiting

483
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,374
to talk to
his wife.

484
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:31,377
Enough time has
been wasted.

485
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:38,551
Poland, no!

486
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,637
Warsaw no telephone!

487
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,014
B-b-b-b-b-b-boom!

488
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:45,767
Thank you.

489
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:48,311
Poland no exist.

490
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:51,522
Solidarity caput!

491
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:54,942
Oh.

492
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:57,362
It is quite clear
to me.

493
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,738
From now on,
this is the only

494
01:09:58,946 --> 01:10:00,823
safe place
for them.

495
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:12,502
Excuse me, sir.

496
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,754
Did you just get
those goods here?

497
01:10:14,962 --> 01:10:15,713
Yes.

498
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:16,839
Have you paid
for them?

499
01:10:17,048 --> 01:10:17,715
Of course.

500
01:10:17,924 --> 01:10:19,592
May I see
the receipt?

501
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:28,643
I left my gloves
on the refrigerator,

502
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:29,936
I had to come back
for them.

503
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:31,229
I see.

504
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:33,815
I'll just check
the goods anyway.

505
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:18,568
Only two loads
this time.

506
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:19,986
One I paid for.

507
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:20,903
And I better not
come back

508
01:11:21,112 --> 01:11:22,530
for a couple
of days.

509
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:25,867
Hey!

510
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:42,008
From Poland,
Kudaj.

511
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:52,185
From his wife.

512
01:11:56,147 --> 01:11:57,440
Censored.

513
01:12:03,863 --> 01:12:08,618
Spaghetti, thermal underwear,
sweatshirts.

514
01:12:42,819 --> 01:12:45,196
Save on carpet
delivery.

515
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,281
Start on thermal
underwear.

516
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:34,704
Time for your spaghetti,
Mrs. Kudaj.

517
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:43,087
Excuse me, sir!

518
01:13:43,296 --> 01:13:43,629
Excuse me!

519
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:45,131
Your glove!

520
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:55,892
The manager would
like to see you.

521
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,268
This way please.

522
01:14:12,742 --> 01:14:15,578
Well you are
a regular customer, sir.

523
01:14:15,786 --> 01:14:18,706
My supervisor's noted
you quite often.

524
01:14:18,915 --> 01:14:19,874
You don't spend
a great deal,

525
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,419
but you do come
in a lot.

526
01:14:23,628 --> 01:14:25,546
Live nearby don't you?

527
01:14:25,755 --> 01:14:26,964
Yes.

528
01:14:27,173 --> 01:14:28,341
Yet you always
use your bike

529
01:14:28,549 --> 01:14:29,759
when you come in.

530
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:39,101
What did you want
to ask me?

531
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,939
Just how you enjoyed
your friend's turkey, sir.

532
01:14:51,322 --> 01:14:53,449
It was okay.

533
01:14:53,658 --> 01:14:55,242
It's Mrs. Rostrom.

534
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:57,161
He's in conference.

535
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:01,666
Good, good.

536
01:15:01,874 --> 01:15:04,085
When my supervisor told me
about you the other day,

537
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:07,129
I put two
and two together.

538
01:15:07,338 --> 01:15:10,174
The man who always
leaves his gloves.

539
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:17,974
Do you mind if I see you
to your bicycle, sir?

540
01:15:53,426 --> 01:15:55,344
Is this your bike, sir?

541
01:15:55,553 --> 01:15:58,723
Yes.

542
01:15:58,931 --> 01:16:01,517
Very nice.

543
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:03,019
It's very nice.

544
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:08,691
So this is it,
Mrs. Rostrom.

545
01:16:46,353 --> 01:16:48,230
Mr. Nowak?

546
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:49,231
Yes.

547
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,192
Took your bloody
time didn't ya?

548
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,152
Three hundred and fifty
yards pine flooring.

549
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,362
Cash on delivery.

550
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:57,865
Cash on delivery.

551
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:00,785
Two hundred
and two pounds.

552
01:17:00,993 --> 01:17:02,912
I'm left with
70 pound now.

553
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,365
Remember me?

554
01:17:39,573 --> 01:17:41,867
Yes.

555
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:43,244
Yes, you were the--

556
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:46,705
I brought these sweatshirts
some time ago.

557
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:48,874
Yes, and is there
anything wrong with them?

558
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,960
The size.

559
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:52,336
I need bigger.

560
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:06,725
Happy New Year.

561
01:18:11,522 --> 01:18:13,149
Same to you.

562
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:00,905
I don't want
to confess.

563
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:04,116
I no longer
believe in God.

564
01:19:04,325 --> 01:19:09,705
I'm here to find
my...self-respect.

565
01:19:09,914 --> 01:19:12,166
I chose those men
because they were stupid,

566
01:19:12,374 --> 01:19:14,251
I thought I could
control them.

567
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,087
But I can't.

568
01:19:17,338 --> 01:19:19,965
I'm weaker than
they are.

569
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:47,034
Banaszak!

570
01:20:45,509 --> 01:20:47,386
I forgot it's
new year.

571
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:50,055
They should go to
the Polish church.

572
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:52,182
But the risk's
too great.

573
01:21:45,861 --> 01:21:47,321
Huh?

574
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:10,803
I should have seen
this coming.

575
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:13,097
They've had
about enough.

576
01:22:13,305 --> 01:22:15,724
I have to get
them back to work!

577
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:20,104
Whatever the priest says.

578
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,240
They've accepted
the deal,

579
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:32,282
but they want
their bonus

580
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:34,159
to go shopping
tomorrow.

581
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,120
Twenty pounds each.

582
01:22:36,328 --> 01:22:38,080
I still need that
money for a deposit

583
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:40,207
to hire the sander.

584
01:22:59,601 --> 01:23:02,479
There are flights
to Warsaw now.

585
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:08,152
We are booked
on Tuesday morning.

586
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,487
It's our last
Saturday.

587
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:15,242
What if the telephone
rings now?

588
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:21,039
We can't wait about
much longer.

589
01:23:21,248 --> 01:23:22,124
They want to buy

590
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:26,712
their bloody watches
this afternoon.

591
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,006
But what if the phone
rings now?

592
01:23:35,387 --> 01:23:37,389
Airline tickets
to Poland?

593
01:23:37,598 --> 01:23:39,099
You must be joking.

594
01:23:39,308 --> 01:23:41,435
No deposit,
no sander.

595
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:43,604
Yeah, I'm just gettin'
through it now.

596
01:23:49,902 --> 01:23:52,279
We could deposit
our passports.

597
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:58,368
Look, we can't go anywhere
without them.

598
01:23:58,577 --> 01:24:00,204
We have to go home
on Tuesday.

599
01:24:00,412 --> 01:24:02,331
You want to go back Tuesday
that's your lookout.

600
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:04,833
No deposit,
no sander.

601
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,172
How much was it
exactly?

602
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:13,634
Sixty quid deposit,
8.60 a day, plus VAT.

603
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:15,886
That's 69 pounds 89.

604
01:24:59,763 --> 01:25:02,558
Call me thief.

605
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,768
They'll have to let me
in sooner or later.

606
01:25:04,977 --> 01:25:07,771
When they realize that
unless the sander's returned,

607
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,274
they'll never get
their money back.

608
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:12,985
They can't manage
without me.

609
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:14,736
They need me.

610
01:25:24,621 --> 01:25:26,206
Anna.

611
01:26:39,404 --> 01:26:43,075
They told me I'm free
to do as I like.

612
01:26:43,283 --> 01:26:48,246
They don't want to be told
what to do anymore.

613
01:26:48,455 --> 01:26:49,956
Let them try.

614
01:26:54,753 --> 01:26:55,837
Hey you lot!

615
01:26:56,046 --> 01:26:58,590
Switch that damn
thing off!

616
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:01,968
Banaszak,!

617
01:27:12,312 --> 01:27:15,190
Switch it off!

618
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:17,693
You can do what you like
in your own country!

619
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,028
But if you don't stop
that noise this minute,

620
01:27:20,237 --> 01:27:23,365
I'll...I'll call
the police!

621
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:25,200
Go back to Poland!

622
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:29,246
You, you, you Commies!

623
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:53,145
Morning.

624
01:27:53,353 --> 01:27:53,812
Morning.

625
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,063
We have the machine.

626
01:27:55,272 --> 01:27:59,401
Ah, yeah, I'm not
the man you want.

627
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,403
Who's the bloody army?

628
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,947
Didn't think you were
going back till tomorrow.

629
01:28:04,156 --> 01:28:06,074
Can I take my bleeding
coat off?

630
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,455
Sixty quid deposit, right.

631
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,832
There you are.

632
01:28:24,468 --> 01:28:25,886
Bye!

633
01:28:37,105 --> 01:28:37,981
They've just
discovered

634
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,192
their new toys
make no sound.

635
01:28:42,235 --> 01:28:44,112
They have no more
use for me.

636
01:28:44,321 --> 01:28:46,239
They want to finish
the job on their own.

637
01:28:47,699 --> 01:28:49,242
The boss will have
his London refuge

638
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:52,954
if he ever
gets out.

639
01:28:53,163 --> 01:28:54,080
What am I
doing here

640
01:28:54,289 --> 01:28:57,292
with five pence
in my pocket...

641
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:59,377
and no present
for Anna?

642
01:29:13,767 --> 01:29:16,394
Forty-eight pounds.

643
01:29:16,603 --> 01:29:19,272
She'd like that.

644
01:29:19,481 --> 01:29:22,609
Cashmere, silk scarves,
shirts, gloves, ties,

645
01:29:22,818 --> 01:29:26,238
belts and other
gentlemen's accessories.

646
01:29:47,342 --> 01:29:50,136
He's probably worked
here for years.

647
01:29:54,975 --> 01:29:57,477
He must know
all the tricks.

648
01:30:01,523 --> 01:30:03,859
I don't stand
a chance.

649
01:30:05,944 --> 01:30:07,362
Ground floor.

650
01:30:07,571 --> 01:30:10,949
Cashmere, silk scarves,
shirts, gloves, ties,

651
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:14,327
belts and other
gentlemen's accessories.

652
01:30:14,536 --> 01:30:15,829
Well done.

653
01:30:16,037 --> 01:30:20,417
You didn't even take
the price tag off.

654
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:23,211
What am I so
worried about?

655
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:44,190
Ground floor.

656
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:48,361
Cashmere, silk scarves,
shirts, gloves, ties,

657
01:30:48,570 --> 01:30:50,906
belts and other
gentlemen's accessories.

658
01:30:53,366 --> 01:30:55,327
Excuse me, sir.

659
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,329
The scarf.

660
01:30:57,537 --> 01:30:58,330
Yes?

661
01:30:58,538 --> 01:31:00,624
The scarf you took
from there.

662
01:31:00,832 --> 01:31:02,000
Yes, my scarf I took
from there,

663
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,877
I left it on
the counter.

664
01:34:07,519 --> 01:34:14,234
Two AM, Tuesday,
5th of January, 1982.

665
01:34:14,442 --> 01:34:17,612
All we have left now
is my five pence

666
01:34:17,821 --> 01:34:21,533
and a six hour walk
to Heathrow Airport.

667
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:38,049
Now I cannot delay it
any longer.

668
01:34:38,258 --> 01:34:40,426
I must tell them
the truth.

669
01:34:40,635 --> 01:34:44,347
What has happened
in our country.

670
01:34:44,556 --> 01:34:45,682
God help me.
