1
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,320
Here...

2
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,690
we are...

3
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,330
still...

4
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,030
alone.

5
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,270
It is all...

6
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,340
so slow...

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,580
so heavy...

8
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,520
so sad...

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,700
Soon...

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,660
I...

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,900
will be...

12
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,070
old...

13
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,520
and...

14
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,780
it will...

15
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,590
at last...

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,150
be over...

17
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,230
I came to say I'm leaving you

18
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,300
Your tears won't change my mind

19
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,580
You remember happy days gone by

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,030
Hello, Henri.

21
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,830
Don't say that.

22
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,000
You told me to clear out,
so I did.

23
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,770
I have Pimpernel with me.

24
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,870
We're driving to the mountains.

25
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,950
Don't say that.

26
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,920
Don't!

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,460
Hello, Henri.

28
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,830
It's Maité.

29
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,130
You told me to clear out,
so I did.

30
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,940
I took Pimpernel and the car.

31
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,840
We're going to the mountains.
One more thing:

32
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,870
I've got all your poems
and crappy paintings.

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,580
You know where
I'm going to dump them all?

34
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,550
In the water, Henri.
In the river.

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't hang up.
Listen to this.

36
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,030
Look, Pimpernel!
All the lights went out.

37
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,420
What's the date?

38
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,370
May 24, 1983.

39
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
It's 10:20.

40
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,290
Thomas!

41
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,290
Hi.

42
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,390
Terrible heat.

43
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,220
I like it here.

44
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,290
The river, the highway...

45
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,890
Right.

46
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,310
She's a great girl.

47
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,950
Yes.

48
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,420
Of course,
you know how it happened.

49
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,930
You know the story.

50
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,920
She's deaf in one ear...
the left one.

51
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,330
She was sleeping
on her good ear.

52
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,800
I said to her, "You're a love."

53
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Startled, she turned to me...

54
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,900
and asked me how I knew.

55
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,170
I played along...

56
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,180
That's how I found out.

57
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,080
I would have anyway.

58
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,080
Florence is a lousy liar.
She thought I'd said...

59
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,450
"You've got a lover."

60
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,480
I figured it out fast.

61
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,960
I was relieved that I knew him.

62
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,190
Even if he was my best
and only friend.

63
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,720
And now she's gone.

64
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,900
Shit, I never thought
it'd get to that.

65
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,410
It's not like me at all.

66
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,160
That's crazy.

67
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,040
Florence's favorite colors.

68
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,070
She took everything, the bitch.

69
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,760
Where are you going?

70
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,490
Out.

71
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,730
Why won't you talk to me?

72
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,490
Mireille...

73
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,300
Sorry, but I can't talk
about it here and now.

74
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,910
So go talk about it elsewhere.

75
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,750
I forgot my keys. Leave them
in the box if you go out.

76
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm not going out.

77
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,640
You don't love me anymore.

78
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,640
What did you say?

79
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,680
You heard me, Bernard.

80
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,180
Yes.
But don't say that, Mireille.

81
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,350
Why do you say that?
I know it's not easy.

82
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm indifferent to you, but
that's not indifferent to me.

83
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,080
I love loving you,
but my head's a mess.

84
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,790
It took us a while
to love each other equally.

85
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:54,960
I watched your love catch up
with mine. And when it did...

86
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,200
a tune started going round
in my head.

87
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,670
You know I love it when we kiss.

88
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,300
But then the tune went...

89
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,970
"What's she doing here?
Who's that monster?

90
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,070
"How dare she touch me
with her mouth?

91
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,380
"She must think I like it!

92
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,220
"Her breath stinks."
I know you smell good...

93
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,750
but I've convinced myself
that you stink.

94
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,940
When I look at you,
it's not your beauty I see...

95
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,140
but the space you take up:
standing, sitting, lying down.

96
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,020
As I watch you, the tune goes...

97
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,140
"I don't want
this girl anymore."

98
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,820
I don't want anyone else
to have you...

99
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,150
yet I don't want to be loved.

100
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,590
The few times we talk now,
I don't take you seriously.

101
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,560
I talk and listen,
but I'm watching you.

102
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,000
I see your shell and insult you
silently, to hurt myself.

103
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,270
Then I feel pity for you...

104
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,860
and myself.

105
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,380
So I hate us.

106
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,010
Lonelier together than apart,
who could ever love us?

107
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,850
We're gluey together.

108
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,580
I want it to be like before...

109
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,980
To stop all the spying...

110
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,830
to stop all the sabotage...

111
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,460
Bye, angel.
I won't be home late.

112
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,020
My name is Bouriana.

113
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,350
The problem with loners
is that they're never alone.

114
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,750
What'll it be?

115
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,260
A small lemonade.

116
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,190
No small drinks after 10 p.m.

117
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,090
How about a large?

118
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,760
Well?

119
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,940
A glass of milk.

120
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,710
Bouriana...Yes, I'll hold on.

121
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,880
Give me a beer.

122
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,990
How much?

123
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,830
That'll be seven francs.

124
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,770
I'm holding on.

125
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,740
Excuse me.

126
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,380
Can I buy you a coffee?

127
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,090
Thank you.

128
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,720
That's right. I'm Bouriana.

129
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,470
This gentleman's paying
for my coffee.

130
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,120
Bouriana.
"B" as in Bouriana...

131
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,020
"O" as in Ouriana,
"U" as in Uriana...

132
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,920
"R" as in Riana,
"l" as in lana...

133
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,790
"A" as in Ana, "N" as in Na...

134
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,060
and "A" as in Alfred.
Alfred Bouriana!

135
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,210
We're having a real heat wave...

136
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,120
Your emotional blackmail...

137
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,190
it's like making love
in the shit house...

138
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,320
You can't fool me!
It's too late for your love!

139
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,920
I won't fall for that!

140
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,060
1970-1976: High school.

141
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,660
F cheats on me. 3/26/83.

142
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,730
1st shoplifting: 1968.

143
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,670
1st lie to F: 3/13/81.

144
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,810
My bank.

145
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,350
Luxembourg Park - Readings:
1977-1979.

146
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,530
Born: Cochin Hospital - 1960.

147
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,090
1st night with F:
7, rue Pascal, 1/2/81.

148
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,730
Hospital - April '80 - Hernia.

149
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,930
1st kiss F - 12/22/80.

150
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,070
I meet F: 6/2/80.

151
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,880
1st murder attempt: 5/25/83.

152
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,090
The air is so still.

153
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,060
Let's put on a fresh shirt!

154
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,850
Now you're mad!

155
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,950
How can you want to make love...

156
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,790
when the world's such a mess?!

157
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,820
Are you blind?

158
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,970
You act so cute...

159
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,130
but you're just an animal!

160
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,080
You feed on rotten meat...

161
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,980
laced with tenderness.

162
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,980
You like it?

163
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,380
Not me.

164
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,320
Can't you smell it?

165
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,450
You must have a cold!

166
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,430
Or else you'd puke!

167
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,130
You ask me
what's come between us?

168
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,200
Life, that's what!

169
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,610
Isn't that enough for you?

170
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,880
I'm gonna hit!

171
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,750
Watch out! Here it comes!

172
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,630
You gotta hit! Hit!

173
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm gonna hit!

174
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm hitting!

175
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,190
You can't leave, Anna.
We live together.

176
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,220
One, two, three, and four.

177
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,430
Alex? It's your father.

178
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,270
Hi. How are you?

179
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,440
Fine.

180
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,170
What time is it?

181
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,080
6:39.

182
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,710
The telephone startled me...

183
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,620
It was a sort of déjà vu...

184
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,150
like a memory of the present...

185
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,890
That's why...l'm in a daze.

186
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,120
-Tomorrow, I'm...
-I know. That's why...

187
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,070
-Let's drop it.
-All right.

188
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,730
-You heard about Aunt V.?
-No.

189
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,900
She didn't die.

190
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,030
Why should she?

191
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,010
They're keeping her alive
on a drip-feeder.

192
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,340
A plumber's nightmare!

193
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,870
It's dreadful!

194
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,210
That's not new.

195
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,650
I'm counting on you.

196
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,180
If I get senile - Bang!

197
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,090
Who wants to be
a bedridden vegetable?!

198
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,120
Remember our contract:

199
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,960
You put a bullet in my brain!
Promise!

200
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,330
I'm not kidding, Alex!
Swear it!

201
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,930
I already did.

202
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,910
Unless I die first, of course.

203
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,970
Cut that out, you asshole! Shit!

204
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,620
Bernard dear...

205
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,130
I'm giving a party
at my place Friday...

206
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,260
to celebrate the tenth
anniversary of Stan's death.

207
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,760
Bring Mireille with you.

208
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,570
Faster!

209
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,740
Faster!

210
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,070
Your turn now.

211
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,180
Your turn.
Play with me a little.

212
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,850
Then we'll turn over and begin.

213
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,220
Then what?

214
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,820
What is it?

215
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,890
I'm lost.

216
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,830
Wasn't it good?

217
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,730
Not really. Something's wrong...

218
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,430
What?

219
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,100
I don't know.

220
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,110
What's wrong?

221
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,110
I don't like it so wet.

222
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,840
You salivate too much.
I feel like...

223
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,750
You're like Alex. You like it
dry so it almost hurts.

224
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,520
It doesn't hurt.

225
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,120
I prefer touching
when it's not so wet.

226
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,600
It's nicer with saliva.

227
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,890
For you.

228
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:10,160
Don't disappoint me yet...
So soon...

229
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,570
I thought you liked it that way.

230
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,770
But I was wrong.

231
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,250
Tell me when you don't like what
I do so I don't waste my time.

232
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,940
What don't I like?

233
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,880
When I take you in my mouth
and salivate.

234
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,250
I meant when I do it to you.

235
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,350
But I like it when it's wet.

236
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,390
I assumed you'd like
what I like. I was wrong.

237
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,560
No...

238
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,260
Like putting a finger in...

239
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,230
I didn't like that
with Alex at first...

240
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,230
Now I do. But you clench up
before I can get it in.

241
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,400
So we get nowhere.

242
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,910
You know why.

243
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,470
I know. You only let me put
my finger in when I suck you.

244
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,880
But I come too fast that way.

245
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,950
Then you complain.

246
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,650
No. When I want
to give you pleasure...

247
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,600
I don't mind that.

248
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,460
So you say.

249
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,160
I love to hear you moan...

250
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,430
even softly.

251
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,240
And if you weren't so passive...

252
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,640
like Alex...
I'd do it more often.

253
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,180
Be right back.

254
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,150
Cheater!

255
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,190
Me, I'm a sneaky opportunist,
the child of sacrifices...

256
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,370
Me and my shitty asshole, my
blisters, my insatiable shoes...

257
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,740
They judge us by our shoes.

258
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,430
His feet were often sore...

259
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,000
he'd put ice cubes in his shoes.
I tried it once.

260
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,100
It helped at first,
but then it hurt even more.

261
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,700
My feet were growing...

262
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,600
So was my soul...I was becoming
sublime in every way!

263
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,240
I'm Bernard's friend.

264
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,880
He just left.

265
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,020
The poor boy had a stomachache.

266
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,690
Mireille is still here. Come in.

267
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,830
You know Mireille,
his girlfriend?

268
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,080
Do you work nights
at the post office with Bernard?

269
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,250
No. I'm an...oceanographer.

270
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,030
We've got some very special
people here tonight.

271
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,410
That little boy...

272
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:40,320
has the highest IQ for his age
in all of Europe.

273
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,360
That little man there
is the human time-signal.

274
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,740
It's his voice you hear
when you dial 463.84.00.

275
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,180
But it's been downhill
for him ever since.

276
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:10,600
That's Henri Bestouches,
artist and poet.

277
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,350
He's very ill. He has a bullet
lodged in his brain.

278
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,450
There's Mireille over there
with Elizabeth.

279
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,160
The lady in the white sweater,
Josette Lemercier...

280
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,040
was Miss Universe
in the late '50s.

281
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,980
The handsome guy
near the window...

282
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,240
is Jerry Bridgeman.

283
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,220
A U.S. astronaut
who walked on the moon.

284
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,810
Who are you?

285
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,020
I'll be off, Alex.

286
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,640
First came words.
No, emotions...

287
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,020
Sorry. I don't understand.

288
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,130
He says,
"Young people are too silent."

289
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,130
"You've forgotten how to talk."

290
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,370
"Maybe you think
people aren't worth talking to."

291
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,940
That's not it.

292
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,260
"You're wrong.
Maybe you're afraid."

293
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,530
He wants to know
if you like movies.

294
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,800
"I was a grip when movies
were as silent as I am."

295
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,980
"I pushed the first dollies."

296
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,790
"I remember that matinee idol,
Jonas."

297
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,770
"He made the whole crew laugh.

298
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,710
"Whenever they shot
a love scene...

299
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:30,700
"the director
told the actors..."

300
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,720
"to say tender words
to each other before kissing.

301
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,220
"Anything, so one could see
their lips moving.

302
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:47,060
"So in the middle
of a love scene, Jonas...

303
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:53,060
"would make daring comments
on his partner's breasts...

304
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,940
"or proposition her
during a take."

305
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,070
"Jonas,
who was a gentle person...

306
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,210
"and shy with women
in real life...

307
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:13,320
"became a lion
in front of the camera."

308
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,540
He says...

309
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,900
"When the films were shown..."

310
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,640
"during the love scenes...

311
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,740
"one or two people
in the theater would laugh.

312
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,980
"They were deaf people...

313
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,960
"who could lip-read
Jonas' obscenities.

314
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,150
"Silent films were better
because...because..."

315
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,020
Slow down, Sylvain.

316
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,590
Excuse me.

317
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,820
Miss, I watched you all night.

318
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,390
I composed this for you.

319
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,830
I'll play it for you.

320
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,860
We're too old to change
our habits.

321
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,760
Shit!

322
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,670
They say that broken glass...

323
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,050
We should pick it up.

324
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,800
What did he say?

325
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,600
He said, "C'est la vie."

326
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,010
That's what life's about.

327
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:08,940
I was nine when you walked
your first steps.

328
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:13,190
For years,
I lived only for outer space.

329
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:18,220
But don't you think
it's hopelessly screwed up now?

330
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,310
How old are you, Jenny?

331
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,920
18. And you?

332
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,360
I turned 53...recently.

333
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,400
I'll be 28 on August 22nd.

334
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,470
You know what distresses me?

335
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,440
That I've accomplished
so little in my life.

336
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,710
It's my 37th birthday today.

337
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,770
37 goddamn years!

338
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,840
Makes you stop and think.

339
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:25,690
When Mozart was my age,
he had been dead for two years!

340
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,170
How depressing!

341
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,530
But there's a way out:

342
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,400
blowing my brains out!

343
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:36,340
-May I make a call?
-Come with me.

344
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,100
Axel.

345
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,510
Thomas? It's me.

346
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,140
Recovered from your swim?

347
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,520
Is that Florence I hear?

348
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,960
There's a letter for both of you
under the door.

349
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,430
The records in the bag
are for Florence.

350
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,260
That's all. Ciao.

351
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,140
Good night, Nicolas.

352
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,240
Good night, Pimpernel.

353
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,780
You know our names, Mr. Bear?

354
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,420
Of course.

355
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,590
Will you come play
with us tomorrow, Mr. Bear?

356
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:13,890
Only if you go to bed right now!

357
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,260
Good night,
Nicolas and Pimpernel.

358
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,740
Good night
to all our little friends.

359
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,270
Time for beddy-bye.

360
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,370
Kiss your parents good night...

361
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,650
and we'll be back
tomorrow night.

362
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,310
Good night.

363
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:37,550
See you tomorrow.

364
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,900
You're just like Bernard
at a party:

365
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,380
always in the kitchen, alone.

366
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,780
I'll get you a glass.

367
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,780
All the glasses
are in the living room.

368
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,290
This cup is all that's left.

369
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,500
My private cup.

370
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:57,780
I'm the only one
who's ever drunk from it.

371
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:04,810
Even my brother Stan
would never have used it.

372
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:09,380
He bought it for me in ltaly.

373
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:13,330
Stan traveled everywhere.

374
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:20,060
Whenever we were apart,
even as children...

375
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:24,300
we would meet through
telepathy at night.

376
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,370
At exactly 10 p.m...

377
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:30,640
I'd think very hard of Stan...

378
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,780
and he'd think very hard of me.

379
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:42,390
Three years ago, I forgot
my telepathic date with him.

380
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:49,660
He was in Germany,
on a business trip.

381
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,370
I never saw him again.

382
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:00,710
He died on a German freeway...

383
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,410
In his car...

384
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,010
Totally dead!

385
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:16,420
Be very careful with my cup...

386
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,790
Alexander.

387
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,040
Mireille?

388
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,940
Your hair...

389
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,680
Next time you do something
like that...

390
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,320
please don't do it in my home.

391
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,550
You did it behind
Bernard's back.

392
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:57,080
He'll be furious.

393
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,290
Bernard won't mind,
I assure you.

394
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:04,530
Don't worry.

395
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,450
You, too!

396
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:31,760
Isn't it nice
to drink through the chink?

397
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,680
I'm going to wind up a loser.

398
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,550
Yet I stood a chance.

399
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:11,210
I wanted to be someone
outstanding:

400
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,420
flyer, traveler, musician...

401
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,430
Can't I be reborn?

402
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:26,800
I'm going to wind up a loser.
Yet I stood a chance.

403
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,770
I wanted to be
someone outstanding:

404
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:32,110
flyer, traveler, musician...

405
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,740
Can't I be reborn?

406
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,470
It's our first meeting.

407
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:07,970
Only first times matter to me.

408
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:11,210
Then you won't last long.

409
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,180
If I had a kid,
I'd ignore him once he talked.

410
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,350
For years,
I longed to make love.

411
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,510
Then I actually did it.
I mean...

412
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,320
No, it's the opposite.

413
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:26,130
I never tried to fulfill my best
dreams. Only to re-dream them.

414
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,930
Want some tea?

415
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:30,090
Sure.

416
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,230
There's only one cup.

417
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,540
The label's been cut off.

418
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:44,880
It could be anything.

419
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,400
I saw you in the bathroom
earlier.

420
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,400
Quite a scene.

421
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,270
So you're the spy.

422
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,180
I've tried it more often
since I came to Paris.

423
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,040
Haven't you ever?

424
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,240
I'm too happy for that.

425
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,480
Too happy?

426
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,350
Yes. I mean, too scared.

427
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,050
Where are you from?

428
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,820
Blois. In the Loire Valley.

429
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:35,030
I came here a year ago to live
with my friend, a Parisian.

430
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:38,830
I wanted to act in commercials,
but I got nowhere.

431
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:42,530
I almost got hired
by a chocolate firm...

432
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,540
but then they saw my tooth...

433
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,640
Next, it was a cosmetics firm...

434
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,340
but with my wrinkles...

435
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,810
What wrinkles?

436
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:53,370
On my forehead.

437
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:54,650
I see.

438
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:59,620
Five of them.
I've had them since childhood.

439
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:02,290
I make films.

440
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,620
Films or video?

441
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:08,160
For now,
what I do is dream up titles...

442
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,860
for the films I plan to make.

443
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,390
If I were you...

444
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,670
I have to go into the army
tomorrow.

445
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:19,640
If I were you, I wouldn't go!

446
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,140
Right. Why go,
when we're already veterans?

447
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,170
It's menopause time.

448
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,150
And I'm in a rush.

449
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:30,810
Yet I'm all for conquerors.

450
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:35,160
I had a great line worked out
for the army psychiatrists.

451
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:37,390
I told them
I was unfit for service...

452
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:41,730
because I couldn't sleep
in a room with other guys.

453
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:43,760
It didn't work.

454
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,200
They said the army wasn't for
sleeping. So I'm off tomorrow.

455
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:52,830
Do you fall...

456
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,740
Do you fall in love often?

457
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,840
Yes, easily.

458
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,480
I thought so.

459
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,180
But a real lover sticks around.

460
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:06,020
I feel closer
to people once I've left.

461
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,360
Love is as old as the hills...

462
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,290
Lovers are worn out.

463
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:12,450
Desire isn't easy to come by...

464
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,020
and it doesn't come cheap
nowadays.

465
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,060
There's plenty of passion,
but it gets wasted on details.

466
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,660
And it doesn't travel.
Me, neither.

467
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:25,940
Mireille...

468
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,980
I'm going now.

469
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:31,500
OK.

470
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,730
Who are you in love with
these days?

471
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,230
I'm on to a new heartbreak.

472
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't want to lose it.

473
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,500
My heart's proud of its pain.

474
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,300
Her name is Florence.

475
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,910
I met her two years ago, but I
toyed with her before that.

476
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:07,650
Now she's left me
for my best friend, Thomas.

477
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:09,620
Same old story.

478
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,420
I've never cheated on anyone.

479
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,450
Never got the chance.

480
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:16,890
She's gone.

481
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,160
She left me a note
in our toothglass:

482
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,630
"I'm leaving to forget you."

483
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:25,360
In her deadly prose.

484
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:28,740
We lived in my room.

485
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,640
We slept in my single bed.

486
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,080
And lived on her unemployment.

487
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,240
Yet she still loved me
on Sunday...

488
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:38,750
Even Monday...and Tuesday...

489
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,490
She told me all about her youth.
She had lots of love affairs.

490
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,320
One when she was very young
with a boy who died.

491
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,290
His death nearly destroyed her.

492
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:53,060
I never got along with her...

493
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,660
Last summer,
we were on an Aeolian island.

494
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,690
I gave her my first slap.

495
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:01,030
I could've held back,
but I decided not to.

496
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:03,630
I don't try to change.
She didn't get it...

497
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,580
that I kept tabs on my
cowardice, on my weaknesses.

498
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:12,170
I like to spy on myself
as if I were a foreigner...

499
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,710
a foreign body,
as scientists say.

500
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,020
If I changed,
I'd distort the experiment.

501
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,120
I can see the kind of movies
you'll make.

502
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,250
It's easy to get self-obsessed
when you're alone.

503
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,430
I've got lots of projects,
enough for two lives.

504
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:32,630
I like to view my life
as a biography.

505
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:38,070
Born in Paris 1960. Died
in Paris 2040. I won't leave.

506
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:40,080
Last week I had a dream.

507
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:43,410
In my dream, I was asleep,
then I was awake...

508
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,750
and found a book between
the sheet and the blanket...

509
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,680
a book I'd never seen before.

510
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,450
I leafed through it.
It was my autobiography.

511
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:56,150
But it was unfinished.
I'd died while writing it.

512
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,680
-Want some?
-I don't drink.

513
01:16:30,330 --> 01:16:34,560
Florence was madly
in love with me.

514
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,930
More than I with her.

515
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,660
So now she's down, and I'm out!

516
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,730
When she left three days ago,
we had a...

517
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,500
She took all her things.

518
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:51,510
She wanted to take the letters
I wrote her.

519
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,210
I said they were mine.

520
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:56,280
I wrote them. They're mine.

521
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,950
In the end, I gave in.

522
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:02,930
She doesn't know
I've Xeroxed them.

523
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:11,790
This scarf
is all I have left of her.

524
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,270
But...it's her all over.

525
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,680
You really think so, Mireille?

526
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,540
You know my name?

527
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:32,350
In the army, they should
assign you to espionage.

528
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,040
-Want one?
-I don't smoke.

529
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:02,150
I'm going out for a walk.

530
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:06,850
I'll come with you.

531
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,950
I like walking alone.

532
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,150
So do I.

533
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,860
Then we can go together.

534
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,420
In fact, I don't go out much.

535
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:17,370
I'm scared of getting
pushed under the subway...

536
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:22,240
or being blown up
or finding out I've got cancer.

537
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,170
At 15, I wasn't scared.

538
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:28,700
Now I'm old enough
to be tortured in a war.

539
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,940
I had a nightmare.

540
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,810
Midnight?

541
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,310
Know this one?

542
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,880
"Here's how many nights
and a day

543
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,890
"Here's how long
you've been away

544
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,390
"It was to be
our last time apart

545
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:47,050
"The last strain
on my shipwrecked heart

546
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,820
"You said you'd be back
in spring

547
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,560
"A time for sweetness
and whispering

548
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,360
"You said we'd meet
in a budding grove

549
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,860
"And through Paris streets
we'd rove"

550
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:05,810
"I love you and love you still,
I love you alone and always will

551
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,280
"But if you choose
to go your way

552
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,470
"I'll remember our love
as a happy day

553
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,010
"I'll hit the road,
a smile on my face

554
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,450
"I'll go bask in the sun
some other place

555
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,010
"Sorrows won't make me
give up my life

556
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:21,420
"I'm not as patient
as a sailor's wife"

557
01:20:41,650 --> 01:20:45,450
He got home very late.

558
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,250
I was asleep.

559
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:53,550
For a long time,
he sat on the bed, in the dark.

560
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,220
The sound of the key
had woken me...

561
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,130
but I pretended to be asleep.

562
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,430
I felt his eyes on me.
It was a drag.

563
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,670
It wasn't the first time.

564
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,200
Then...

565
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,440
he got into bed...

566
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:18,070
and made love to me trying to be
gentle so as not to wake me.

567
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,020
He likes to do it that way.

568
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,250
Sometimes he says to me...

569
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,410
"Let go. Play dead."

570
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,510
When I met him...

571
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,430
at first, right after
my father's death...

572
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,330
he felt at ease with me.

573
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:38,860
Now he criticizes me for things.

574
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,270
Things I don't understand.

575
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,200
For him, it all matters:

576
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,370
my past, my future,
my present, and my death...

577
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,210
I often wonder what my father
would've thought of him...

578
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:01,050
and of me today.

579
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:06,620
I am...l'm what I am.

580
01:22:49,010 --> 01:22:50,870
It's very late.

581
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:01,250
It's today I'm leaving.

582
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,920
Everyone's going.
We're the last.

583
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,860
I'm leaving.

584
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,900
It's like a dream for me,
being with you.

585
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,240
Like an unusually deep dream.

586
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,710
Only deep sleep
makes you dream like that.

587
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,790
Sitting beside you this way...

588
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,020
is like eternity.

589
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,960
The moment I saw you...

590
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,560
I knew I was destined
to love you.

591
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,900
I'll say it once and for all:

592
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:53,900
I love you, Mireille,
more than anything.

593
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,730
We must fall in love!

594
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:00,900
Unaware of it, wordlessly...
It's too late!

595
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,640
Pretend you didn't hear that...

596
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,080
Time to shut up. I will.

597
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,640
After 20 years of battling,
silence.

598
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,810
To think that your body
will age...

599
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,480
Shriveled breasts
and more wrinkles, Mireille...

600
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,320
On your belly, under your ass.

601
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,590
It's all my fault...

602
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,720
You see, Mireille, love...

603
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,430
Iove without regrets...

604
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:24,760
Iove without
nasty afterthoughts...

605
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,460
Say come, I'll come,
say smile, I'll smile...

606
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,200
We'll sleep together
for as long as you want...

607
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:34,300
I want to work with you,
form an unbeatable team...

608
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:37,470
Whatever our signs,
Libra or Leo, I'll sign up!

609
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:42,110
Maybe Florence, seeing
our strength, will join us...

610
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:45,750
You and Florence and me...
I'll be the go-between lover...

611
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:47,780
It should be so moving.

612
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,550
Back and forth I go!

613
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:52,930
Alone, you couldn't jolt me out
of my shell...

614
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,930
Together,
we'll change our habits...

615
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:58,300
We'll leave Paris,
maybe even France.

616
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:00,240
And out of love for me, Alex...

617
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:02,430
you'll stop
destroying yourself...

618
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,030
You'll respect the warmth
of your blood...

619
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,470
your serene presence...

620
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:09,210
your clear perception,
your gentle feelings...

621
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,650
Under your impulse,
our melancholy will fade away.

622
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,980
If I could only escape
monologues, Mireille.

623
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:16,850
Mental diarrhea!

624
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:19,520
Not set my sufferings to music!

625
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,680
Not bury my lover with words!

626
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:24,090
But if I shut up,
she'll kill herself!

627
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:26,790
Kisses won't seal our lips...

628
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,490
Help me take wing, Mireille...
I weigh a ton!

629
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:32,730
Don't look, I'm a truck!

630
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:36,260
I'll never live again,
Mireille. Never!

631
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:15,870
Sorry, I'm going to the can.

632
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,210
Hold it, young man.

633
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:26,480
You can't relieve yourself
until we're moving.

634
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:47,810
Taken!

635
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,210
Got any change?

636
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:29,120
I'll have one last game.

637
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,750
It's not two francs.

638
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:33,260
It's three.

639
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:37,020
The cost of living goes up.

640
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,790
Life doesn't.

641
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,020
Try again, Earthling!

642
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:48,080
How about this for an answer!

643
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:55,760
I've had it, never again!

644
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:02,200
They'll never screw me again!
It's over.

645
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,970
He's not even tired.

646
01:30:09,010 --> 01:30:13,310
But he's going home
to his mistress.

647
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:16,840
He played badly.
He lost everything.

648
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,580
But he'll play tomorrow.

649
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:22,350
He's going to sleep
in her bed...in her arms.

650
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:24,190
Good night.

651
01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,840
Try again...

652
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,340
Earthling!

653
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,490
Mireille...

654
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:42,290
It's Alex, I missed my train.

655
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:56,080
Can I speak to Mireille?

656
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,660
I'm not here, Bernard.

657
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:33,540
I'm not here at all.

658
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:25,780
Mireille, it's Alex.

659
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,720
Alex, help me...

660
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:06,250
to get out of this...

661
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,040
Bernard!

662
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,750
Bernard...
I turn my back to you.
