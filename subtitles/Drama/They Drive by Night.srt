1
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,519
-How's it going, Joe?
-Okay. Fill her up.

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,795
-What are you hauling?
-Apples.

3
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,678
-How's your brother, Paul?
-Asleep.

4
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,878
Every time you come here,
he's asleep and you're driving.

5
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,917
-What is he, a growing boy?
-He drives as much as l do.

6
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,639
You run your station,
we'll take care of our rig.

7
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,993
l was just wondering.

8
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,787
This is the nearest l've had
to a bath in two weeks.

9
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,277
Yeah, l noticed.

10
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:10,795
Seventy gallons of gas, three quarts
of oil in your crankcase--

11
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:14,029
-l'll have to get you on the way back.
-Five quarts in your spare--

12
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:15,471
What did you say?

13
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,389
l can't pay till l drop off this load.

14
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:20,434
-Why didn't you say that?
-You wouldn't have given me the gas.

15
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,906
l'll say. l got a notion to
siphon it out of there.

16
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,272
You know l ain't selling gas on time.

17
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,427
Relax. l wouldn't gyp you. l'm honest.

18
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,906
l know you are. All you truckers
are honest, but you're always broke.

19
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:34,785
The finance company comes, you're out
of business, and l never see dough.

20
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:37,668
Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first.

21
00:02:37,835 --> 00:02:42,272
That won't be tough, you ain't driving
any speedway special. Sign it.

22
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:45,984
-Twelve dollars and 90 cents.
-Don't overflow your tank.

23
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:48,145
On the cuff. How do you like that?

24
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,431
-You'll get it on the trip back.
-You didn't pay for this pop.

25
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:52,913
Put it on the bill.

26
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:05,583
-Where are we?
-Not far from Lansdale.

27
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,510
-You should have woke me up.
-lt's okay.

28
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:13,824
We'll grab a cup of coffee at Barney's.
Then you can wheel it into Los Angeles.

29
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:18,144
How's about laying over at my house
for a couple of days? l'm knocked out.

30
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:21,623
l'd like to stay in bed for a week,
not even get up to eat.

31
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,383
So would l.

32
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:25,223
But that ain't the way
we get ahead.

33
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,985
l gotta think of Pearl.
l ain't been home for two weeks.

34
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,790
She might as well be
married to an explorer.

35
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,904
Look out, Joe!

36
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,623
You dirty son of a road hog!

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,468
-You should've smacked into him.
-What is that gonna get us?

38
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,618
What do we do now?

39
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:52,906
You watch the load, l'm gonna hop
up to Barney's and phone Williams.

40
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,628
And see if he'll send some
of the dough he owes us.

41
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:03,946
Thanks.

42
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:08,547
Hi, Harry.

43
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,302
Hello, Joe. Where's your rig?

44
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:14,539
-Down the road. Busted wheel.
-Oh, tough going. Can l help?

45
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:17,267
l'm gonna phone Williams to send
the dough he owes me.

46
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:20,020
l hope you get it.
l quit hauling for that crook.

47
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,017
Ran me ragged and l
hardly ever got paid.

48
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:25,263
He'll pay me now, or he won't
get his apples in L.A. on time.

49
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:28,417
You got him over a barrel,
that's different. Maybe you'll get it.

50
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,577
-Come on. We go.
-Yeah, he's right.

51
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:34,134
Can't make no dough drinking coffee.

52
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:35,295
Good luck, guy.

53
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:36,944
-Same to you.
-Thanks.

54
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:40,097
Oh, Harry! Write your wife.
l hear she's worried.

55
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:41,983
Okay, l will. Thanks.

56
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,422
-Hello, Joe.
-Hello, Jake. How's it going?

57
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,099
-Give me a Frisco phone book, will you?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,300
Be sure you bring back
all the pages too.

59
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,783
So l'm telling you, see. . .

60
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:54,662
. . .here l am with these two
beautiful dames. What equipment.

61
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:57,776
They're hanging around my neck,
begging me not to go.

62
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,218
l tell them, ''Look, sisters,
l got a job to do. ''

63
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,782
So l push them away and leave.

64
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,298
After all, a guy like me with
hundreds of dames. . . .

65
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:08,058
l'm getting out of here.
Come on, Shorty. lt's too deep for me.

66
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,851
l'm losing my touch.
Give me some nickels, Barney.

67
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,057
Joe! Where you been, guy?
Been getting any good hauls?

68
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,938
Some. How they been for you, lrish?

69
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,692
l still get my check
every Saturday.

70
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,657
But you get ordered around
every other day. Ain't for me.

71
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,616
Hey, Red, this steak's tough.

72
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,616
You can't send it back now.
You bent it.

73
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,617
-l'll be back this way tonight, Red.
-Thanks for the warning.

74
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,814
Give me the phone, will you?

75
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:53,967
-What, you keep it in a vault?
-Don't call New York.

76
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,016
Another cup of java.

77
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,208
-You must like our coffee.
-lt stinks.

78
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,891
You're drinking your seventh cup.

79
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:04,255
l like your sugar. Why don't you
and your brother quit wildcat trucking?

80
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,573
With a legitimate company,
this is a swell job.

81
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:09,297
Why don't you get smart like me
and work for Ed Carlsen?

82
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,413
-Give me long distance.
-Hey!

83
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:14,329
Relax, l'm reversing the charges.

84
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,610
There's only one guy l'd sooner
work for than Carlsen.

85
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:18,765
-Who?
-Me.

86
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:22,247
You ain't working for you,
you're working for the finance company.

87
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,930
Soon as your truck's paid for,
you'll need another one.

88
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:30,294
Hello? l wanna talk to Mike Williams.
Standard 7-2961 , San Francisco.

89
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,970
Reverse the charges.
Joe Fabrini calling.

90
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:35,454
Don't worry about me.

91
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:39,129
Someday you road-skinners will say,
''Joe Fabrini's a good guy to work for. ''

92
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:42,127
-And l will be.
-No doubt about that, kid, but me. . .

93
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,603
. . .l'll take the salary and let
someone else worry.

94
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,285
That's the easy way.
Give me a cup of coffee.

95
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:51,014
-Anything else?
-What else you got that ain't poisonous?

96
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,607
l don't know. l never eat here.

97
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:56,089
-How about taking my order, Red?
-How about taking your time?

98
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,483
Nice new fixture, Barney.

99
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,644
Yeah. She'll do.

100
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,640
Not a bad thing to know.
Nice chassis, huh, Joe?

101
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:05,967
Classy chassis.

102
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:09,329
Yes, and it's all mine too.
l don't owe any payments on it.

103
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,089
l'd be glad to finance it, baby.

104
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,169
Who are you kidding?
You couldn't even pay for the headlights.

105
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,846
What? He won't accept the call?

106
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:19,889
Wait a minute. Hey, lrish.

107
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,282
Lend me a buck,
l wanna pay for the call.

108
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,249
Get a load of the big trucking operator.

109
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,924
l still vote for a salary.

110
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,127
Okay. l'll pay for it at this end.

111
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,721
This is 221 2.

112
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:36,397
Anything else?

113
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,002
Yeah, but it ain't on the menu.

114
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,967
And it ain't gonna be.
You better settle for a hamburger.

115
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,689
Okay. With onions.

116
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:45,921
Hello, Mike Williams?

117
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,080
What's the idea of ducking
my phone call?

118
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,597
l never take collect calls.
Where are you?

119
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:59,805
Barney's Café, north of Lansdale, 99.

120
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,324
You got a busted wheel?

121
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,877
Look, Fabrini, those apples have gotta
be delivered to the market tonight.

122
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:09,278
-That ain't wood you're hauling.
-Okay, l'll get the apples in. . .

123
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,962
. . .but send me some of that 300 bucks
you owe me so l can get a new wheel.

124
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,957
Yeah, wire it to me, right here.

125
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:19,240
Well, l ain't got much
cash right now, Joe.

126
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:23,120
All right, all right, don't get excited.
l'll see what l can do.

127
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:25,920
Who do those Fabrini guys
think they are, anyhow?

128
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:29,282
l've thrown more business their way
than any freight agent in town. . .

129
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,197
-. . .and l ain't sending money.
-The apples won't get to L.A.

130
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:35,721
They will if somebody else hauls them.
Who's up there near Lansdale?

131
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,797
Hank Dawson. He's due there
and we don't owe him much money.

132
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:42,400
You get him on the phone
and tell him to pick up Fabrini's load.

133
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:45,273
Those Fabrinis are tough babies.

134
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:47,877
They only think they're tough.

135
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,761
Say, is Farnsworth still outside?

136
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,160
-He was a minute ago.
-Tell that loan shark l wanna see him.

137
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:58,395
But you fellas don't understand.
Everything l do is within the law.

138
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,632
All l can say is,
we need a lot of new laws.

139
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:02,395
Hey, the boss wants to talk to you.

140
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:03,551
Excuse me, gentlemen.

141
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:06,190
Bye-bye, buzzard.
What's the matter with the man?

142
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:09,679
Tell me, Farnsworth, do the Fabrinis
owe you any dough on that truck?

143
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,480
l've been trying to catch them.

144
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:13,996
They're behind three payments,
plus my interest.

145
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,631
l know all about your interest.
Would you like to repossess the truck?

146
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,553
-Yeah, certainly.
-Here's your chance.

147
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:22,473
They're stuck with a busted wheel
near Barney's Café on 99.

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,030
-Get a tow car and haul in the rig.
-Thanks. l'll do you a favor sometime.

149
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,431
Just don't lend me any money.
That's all l ask of you.

150
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,989
You know what happened?
The guy had an iron. . . .

151
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,237
-What are you doing here?
-l got blisters waiting. . .

152
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,959
. . .so l hitched to Lansdale
and got a secondhand wheel.

153
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,551
Told the guy l'd get the dough.

154
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,754
-What about the load?
-Got a kid watching it.

155
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:50,706
-How'd you make out with Williams?
-l'm still waiting for the dough.

156
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,555
Why do we stay in this racket?

157
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,676
We aren't gonna make enough
to buy ourselves decent coffins.

158
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,749
Stop crabbing. l got enough worries.

159
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,908
Get that into you.
We gotta start rolling.

160
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:05,509
All right, that's enough
of the x-ray treatment.

161
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:07,190
Don't get me wrong, sister.

162
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,349
All you make me think about is how
much l'd like to be with my wife.

163
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,194
First time l've ever heard that one.

164
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:16,745
-l ain't got a wife.
-That's not hard to understand.

165
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,996
lf any of you guys owe on your trucks,
you better fade.

166
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,106
Farnsworth's coming.

167
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,742
-Where's Fabrini?
-With Byrd, at the South Pole.

168
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,142
Fishing with the president.

169
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,509
l heard he was playing left end
for Notre Dame.

170
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:41,745
lt ain't nothing personal.
He bought a truck and he's gotta pay.

171
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:42,902
Why?

172
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:45,462
Everything on that pile
makes noise except the horn.

173
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,467
l'm standing on my legal rights!
l gotta make a living too.

174
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,544
-Why?
-Because it says in the law--

175
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:54,467
l ain't gonna argue with you fellas.
Miss, did you see Joe Fabrini around?

176
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:55,952
l know he's been here.

177
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,627
-He pulled out more than an hour ago.
-Yeah? Whose wheel is that outside?

178
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,271
lt's mine.

179
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,662
-Wanna make anything out of it?
-Now, no offense.

180
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:06,903
Listen, runt, we don't
like you around here.

181
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,745
-Throw him out, boy!
-l'm warning you!

182
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:14,067
There he goes!

183
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,381
Yeah! He's over for a touchdown!

184
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,542
Thanks, honey.
l'll do you a favor sometime.

185
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,749
That's all right, l don't like them either.
They got a coat of mine once.

186
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,549
-How much do we owe for the chow?
-Thirty-six.

187
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,224
-Here you are. Keep the change.
-Thanks.

188
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,539
lt's all right. He's on his way.

189
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,507
-Thanks, fellas. l'll be seeing you.
-So long, Joe.

190
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,705
-Take it easy, Joe.
-Come on, kid.

191
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,666
-Where's the wheel?
-Right over there.

192
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,778
lf we're lucky, maybe we can get a ride.

193
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,620
Who's this?

194
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,503
Hi, Dawson.

195
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:54,306
-Hello. How are you, Joe?
-Hello. Will you give us a lift?

196
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,298
-We had some trouble.
-Williams told me.

197
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:57,856
-Williams?
-Yeah.

198
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:00,177
He sent me here to
pick up your load.

199
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:01,382
That dirty muzzler.

200
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:04,060
We carry the load all this way
and we don't get a dime.

201
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,019
-Suppose we don't give it to you.
-You can suit yourself. . .

202
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:10,098
. . .but if you miss market, you'll take
a rap for the whole load.

203
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,536
-Yeah, just let him try to collect.
-Shut up.

204
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:15,778
Of course he'll collect,
out of the dough he owes us.

205
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:17,459
You're a nice guy, Dawson.

206
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:20,697
-Why do you pull stuff like this?
-lt ain't my fault, Joe.

207
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,379
l got a wife and a kid
and another one on the way.

208
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:26,059
l gotta do what Williams says,
or l don't get no hauls.

209
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:29,574
-Don't get sore at me.
-l'd like to kick that chiseler's teeth out.

210
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,941
That ain't gonna get you nothing,
and besides, Hank ain't interested.

211
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:34,378
Come on. Let's hop in.

212
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,933
-Give us a hand, will you?
-Yeah, sure.

213
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,294
-Ready?
-Yeah.

214
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,655
That's it.

215
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,734
Our rig's about two miles
down the road.

216
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,302
And where do we go from there?

217
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,976
We better go back to Frisco
and see Williams.

218
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:55,454
By the time l get home to my wife
l'll be too tired to turn out the light.

219
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:05,580
Come on, Williams ought to be
in his office by now.

220
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,777
What if he don't see it?

221
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,533
What do you think?

222
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,934
Hello, Joe.

223
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,739
How they rolling?
How's that broken-down tub of yours?

224
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,174
No loads yet. Hang around.

225
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,772
What do you think
we been doing?

226
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,731
Tell Williams we want to see him.

227
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,414
You guys again?
You heard me say there ain't any loads.

228
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,174
Who said we wanted any?
We don't get paid for them anyway.

229
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,573
Oh, hello, boys.
How'd you get back?

230
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,893
What's the difference?

231
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,650
We should wrap a crank around you.

232
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:45,252
We got a hunch it was you
put Farnsworth on our tail.

233
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:48,693
What did l want to see you boys
lose your truck for?

234
00:13:48,937 --> 00:13:51,849
l got some beer hauls in mind for you,
something coming up soon.

235
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:55,692
Beer's out, you bring back the empties.
Three hauls a week, how'd you like that?

236
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:58,974
-We'd like it fine if we got paid.
-You been horsing around enough.

237
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,446
We ought to break your neck
for leaving us stuck. . .

238
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:02,970
. . .then lifting our load.

239
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,087
What, you want me to dig
into my pocket. . .

240
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:07,372
. . .every time you fold a wheel
or blow a tire?

241
00:14:07,576 --> 00:14:09,885
-l'm just as broke as you are.
-What is this, tin?

242
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:12,489
Here, here, here.
Where's your manners, anyhow?

243
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:13,974
Going into a man's papers.

244
00:14:14,135 --> 00:14:16,410
You owe us 300 bucks
and you're gonna pay us now!

245
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,770
-lf you don't--!
-All right! Don't get hot.

246
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,847
-l'll give you a check.
-What'll we do, use it for a tire patch?

247
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:24,370
We'll take it out of here. Cash.

248
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:26,844
Let go of him, Paul,
and write out a receipt.

249
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:29,448
You know, there's a law
against taking people's money.

250
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:32,048
That was so, you'd have been
in the clink years ago.

251
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,170
l knew you'd see it our way.

252
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,608
You mark my words,
you guys are gonna regret this.

253
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,367
We're tired of taking chances
and leaving you the dough.

254
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,048
That's the worst of you road slobs!
Always getting too big for your britches!

255
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:47,046
But l don't mind telling you one thing:
this is the last load you'll ever get here.

256
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:50,125
ln that case, we haven't got
anything to lose, have we?

257
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,048
There's your receipt.

258
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,081
There's a bad curve
sitting out front.

259
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,640
lt's got mud on it. Be careful.

260
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:09,085
Go to sleep, will you?
l'm driving now.

261
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,366
l was just reminding you.

262
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,285
lf we go over a cliff, wake me up.

263
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,809
Pour on the brakes.

264
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,044
lf we stop and pick up everybody
we see on the road. . .

265
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,041
. . .we ain't gonna get in till next week.

266
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,677
lt's a dame. lt won't hurt to
get her out of the rain.

267
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:31,445
lt's too bad one of them hotshot
passenger cars couldn't give her a lift.

268
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:37,479
Come on, hop in.

269
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:45,039
Thanks. l was beginning to
wonder if l'd ever get a ride.

270
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:47,279
Well, you got one now, so relax.

271
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:49,836
You're the dame that was
slinging hash at Barney's.

272
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,645
-That's me.
-Well, what happened?

273
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,401
Barney had about 1 2 hands,
and l didn't like any of them.

274
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,556
Barney's all right.

275
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,717
You didn't have to pass him
1 00 times a day.

276
00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:00,525
-lt was like tangling with an octopus.
-How far you going?

277
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,722
-How far are you going?
-We're going to L.A.

278
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:03,875
That's okay by me.

279
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,037
l'd just as soon be out of a job
one place as another.

280
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:09,244
Wait a minute. l better. . .

281
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:11,203
. . .wrap you up.

282
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:14,279
-What's your name, Red?
-Cassie Hartley.

283
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,322
You know anyone in L.A.?

284
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:19,238
-Well, what are you gonna do?
-Get a room, look for work.

285
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,560
Jobs ain't growing
on bushes these days.

286
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:24,875
-How much dough you got?
-Enough to get by.

287
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:28,673
You're gonna lose your teeth chattering
if we don't get something hot into you.

288
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,482
Pull into Mandel's, Paul.
We've been rolling pretty good.

289
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,201
Pearl's waiting up for me.

290
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,082
l was going to spend
an hour with her.

291
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,916
So you'll spend a half-hour
with her. Oh, look.

292
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,801
lt's clearing up. We'll be all right.

293
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:41,078
Don't stop on my account.

294
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,279
We gotta stop,
it might as well be Mandel's.

295
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:44,956
That ain't home.

296
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:47,716
Pearl can't cook a steak
like Billy Mandel.

297
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,112
l ain't interested in steaks.

298
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:05,596
How come you're here?
Ain't you behind schedule?

299
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,116
l've been having tough luck.
l won 48 free games.

300
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:11,795
l tried to shoot them, but l kept winning.
Only three games and then l roll.

301
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,509
And l'll have to push my foot through
the floorboard to make up my schedule.

302
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,599
What will it be, boys?

303
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,148
A T-bone, rare,
and make it good this time.

304
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,958
The last one l had could've
been used for a manhole cover.

305
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,997
This one will be so tender,
it'll throw its arms around you.

306
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,478
-Same for you?
-Yeah.

307
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:28,958
l'll just have some coffee.

308
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,077
-Bring her a steak.
-Fattening her up, huh?

309
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:36,072
-Something else for you, honey?
-Yes. Cool off your imagination.

310
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:38,274
Hey, McNamara.
Where are you going?

311
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,827
-What's it to you?
-Come on. We go.

312
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:43,033
What's the matter?
Don't you know me?

313
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,673
-Hello, Joe.
-Come on. Sit down, Harry.

314
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:50,588
-What are you guys doing here?
-What do you suppose we're doing?

315
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,667
-Have a cup of coffee?
-l had five.

316
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,549
Don't do any good.
l'm still sleepy.

317
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:57,754
-Come on. We go.
-Yeah, he's right.

318
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,430
l haven't seen my wife for so long.

319
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:04,475
As soon as l deliver this load,
l'm hot-tailing it home empty.

320
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:07,388
Bet when l walk in the kids will say,
''Who's that man?''

321
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:10,991
You should have wrote, Harry.
l know how worried Pearl gets.

322
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,594
No use writing now.

323
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:14,824
l'll be home tomorrow
night and surprise her.

324
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,871
l hear you've been
doing pretty good.

325
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:20,550
Yeah. l got the truck all paid for.
Don't owe a cent.

326
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,029
Come on. Let's go.

327
00:18:23,194 --> 00:18:25,264
When you guys are hitting
the road tomorrow. . .

328
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:27,948
. . .think of me in that
nice white bed.

329
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:29,991
So long, guys.

330
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:32,225
So long, Harry.

331
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:35,430
Well, you gotta have your brains
knocked out to be a truck driver.

332
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,948
You don't have to, but it helps.

333
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:41,669
Here she goes, boys, the last game.
Then l can hit the road.

334
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,788
l don't know why l mess
with them machines.

335
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:46,147
They almost cost me my job three times.

336
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,540
lrish, you remember Cassie.

337
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:49,907
Sure. Hi, Cassie.
Quit working for Barney?

338
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,381
Yeah. He was always trying
to tie my apron strings.

339
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:55,987
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-There is if you're not wearing an apron.

340
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,665
Fifty-eight free games!
l'll never get away from here.

341
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:31,819
-What's that for?
-Gonna pass.

342
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,297
lf it's clear ahead,
he'll wink back at me.

343
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,784
That's funny.
lt looks clear to me. Hey, Paul.

344
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:46,221
Yeah? What is it?

345
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:48,184
Ain't that McNamara's
truck ahead of us?

346
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,815
What do l care
whose truck it is?

347
00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:53,417
Yeah, it looks like it.

348
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,224
lt is.

349
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:01,413
What's the matter with him?
He's all over the road.

350
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,860
-He must be asleep.
-Blow your horn.

351
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:05,219
Not unless l have to.

352
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:07,820
He might come to and run
his rig off the road.

353
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:17,857
-We gotta try to head him off.
-Watch out he don't cut into us.

354
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:26,453
Get over close. l'll try to hit his hood
with this and wake him up.

355
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,779
Pull over closer and l'll
try to hop aboard!

356
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:36,901
Watch out!

357
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:53,691
Grab the extinguisher!

358
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,890
-How many in there?
-There were two.

359
00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:07,725
Oh, Paul, you're late.

360
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,365
How's about coming in
for some coffee, Joe?

361
00:22:12,574 --> 00:22:15,134
Oh, this is Cassie Hartley.

362
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:16,727
This is Pearl, Paul's wife.

363
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,252
-Hello.
-Pleased to know you.

364
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:19,687
Come on, it's cold out here.

365
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:21,890
Can't stop. l'll about make
the market now.

366
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:24,090
-What's wrong with Paul?
-He'll be all right.

367
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:25,846
He just needs a good night's sleep.

368
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,732
Tell him l'll wire him from L.A.
what time l'll pick him up.

369
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:30,008
Bye. Goodbye.

370
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:31,572
Bye.

371
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,211
l can't figure you out.

372
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:42,160
lf you took care of your truck like
yourselves, it'd fall apart in two weeks.

373
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,720
We're tougher than any truck
off any assembly line.

374
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:47,401
l bet your friend Harry McNamara
thought that too.

375
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:49,403
Forget about Harry, will you?

376
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:53,041
He probably was so tired,
he thought the whole thing was a dream.

377
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,361
How much money you got?

378
00:22:55,611 --> 00:22:57,363
Come on, how much?

379
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:00,648
-A dollar and 1 2 cents.
-Just what l thought.

380
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,243
Not even enough to rent a room.

381
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,923
-l'll get by.
-How?

382
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,560
l get rid of this load,
l'll get you a room.

383
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,845
You needn't do that.
l'm grateful for the ride.

384
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:10,078
You've been nice.

385
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:13,287
lf l let you go, l'll be worrying,
wondering what happened to you.

386
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,838
And l got enough worries
the way it is.

387
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:18,604
l guess l'd be pretty dumb
not to say yes.

388
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:20,805
Maybe l'm dumb anyway.

389
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:23,163
You can figure that out later.

390
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:30,362
l ain't used to taking in roomers
at 4:30 in the morning.

391
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:33,439
lt's never too late to start.
The best people check in at 4:30.

392
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:37,520
l don't know about that.
l never see any of them.

393
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,724
Well, anyway, you got
a bed for a week.

394
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:46,800
Yeah. That'll give me time
to find something to do.

395
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,083
-l'll pay you back.
-l'm real worried about that.

396
00:23:50,246 --> 00:23:53,044
l got it all doped out
with the cops if you don't.

397
00:23:57,845 --> 00:23:59,676
What are you crying for?

398
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:02,359
l don't know. Just crying.

399
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:04,960
lf you got a load of
your face, you'd stop.

400
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:08,363
You look like you walked
through a sprinkling system.

401
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:10,840
Oh, you dames are sure screwy.

402
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:12,722
Paul's wife pulls
the same stuff too.

403
00:24:12,924 --> 00:24:13,913
What stuff?

404
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,803
One minute she's all right,
the next minute, she's bawling.

405
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:18,636
She never knows why.

406
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,234
The trouble with her is,
she wants a kid.

407
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:23,917
Paul says no-go. They can't afford it.

408
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,722
Don't get me wrong.
That's not why l'm crying.

409
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,793
l get a kick out of you.

410
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:33,035
l've picked up lots of girls on the road,
but none of them ever was like you.

411
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:35,275
Come here.

412
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:38,790
Come on, l ain't gonna bite you.

413
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,871
l wasn't afraid of that.

414
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:46,277
l always have liked redheads.

415
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:49,194
You shouldn't. Red means stop.

416
00:24:49,361 --> 00:24:51,431
l'm colorblind.

417
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,795
l think l'd better unpack.

418
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,510
Joe, don't you think you'd
better get on your horse?

419
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,240
What's the rush? We got a
lot of things to talk about.

420
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,158
We can talk some other time.

421
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,833
Now is a nice time.

422
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,911
When l'm relaxed
my thoughts are clear.

423
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:11,475
Yes, l can even read
them from here.

424
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:17,630
You know something, Red?
l like you.

425
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:21,077
l like the way you
fill out your clothes.

426
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,314
l like everything about you.

427
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,672
Are you glad you ran onto me?

428
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:28,798
Yes. You're a nice guy.

429
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:33,394
But you've got to remember that
nice guys leave when ladies ask them to.

430
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:35,833
That nice, l ain't.

431
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:38,227
Mister, you worry me.

432
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:42,787
Oh, Cassie?

433
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:45,915
You're plenty beautiful.

434
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:49,029
Joe, you need sleep and so do l.

435
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:51,709
Will you do me a favor and get going?

436
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:55,068
Joe?

437
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:03,068
Joe.

438
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,185
l'm sorry l woke you up,
l was trying to shut out the kid noise.

439
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:10,066
That's all right.

440
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:15,025
l gotta get going.

441
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:16,383
You sure slept.

442
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:20,143
That's the first time l've been
in a bed in weeks. lt felt good.

443
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:23,104
-Where did you sleep?
-Chair.

444
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:26,384
Oh, l'm sorry, kid. l didn't mean to
gyp you out of your bed.

445
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:29,784
You didn't mean anything.
You went out like you were slugged.

446
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,824
You ought to get yourself a regular job.

447
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:33,977
What do you see
in the trucking business?

448
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:35,465
l'm on my own, anyway.

449
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:39,301
lf a guy can get two or three big rigs,
there's a fortune in this business.

450
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:41,139
You really believe that, don't you?

451
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:44,019
Sure, l believe it.
lf l didn't, l'd be on Paul's side.

452
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:46,575
l'd quit right now,
let Farnsworth take the truck. . .

453
00:27:46,746 --> 00:27:48,384
. . .and go grab a job
digging ditches.

454
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,583
After what l saw last night,
digging ditches looks good to me.

455
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:53,622
No future in it.

456
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:57,580
A shave wouldn't go bad,
but l ain't got time now.

457
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:59,655
l gotta get to market
and hustle up a load.

458
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,861
-When will you be back?
-That depends. Maybe a couple of days.

459
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,538
-Good. l'll have a job by then.
-That's the talking.

460
00:28:05,704 --> 00:28:07,376
ln the meantime, you gotta eat.

461
00:28:07,544 --> 00:28:09,614
This won't take you
into the Cocoanut Grove. . .

462
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:11,820
. . .but you'll get enough till l get back.

463
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:14,577
You must be out of your mind.
You may never see me again.

464
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,621
Don't worry about that.
l'll see you.

465
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,421
Joe.

466
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:27,493
-Don't go to sleep on the road.
-l won't. Not after a pepper-up like that.

467
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:30,017
And don't practice that on anyone else.

468
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:32,012
Save it for me.

469
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,291
-Hiya, fatso.
-How are you, Joe?

470
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:47,411
Oh, l been eating.
Where you going?

471
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,053
Gonna pick up some watermelons.

472
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,812
-Who gave you the load?
-Me.

473
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,335
A guy would get blisters
waiting for a load. . .

474
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,775
. . .so l'm going down to lmperial
and buy some of them babies myself.

475
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:58,497
When market opens, l'll clean up.

476
00:28:58,819 --> 00:29:01,254
You know, they ain't hardly
got a watermelon in town.

477
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,853
That's one way to do it.
Well, good luck, guy.

478
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,651
Thanks. Same to you.

479
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,177
What do you think you're doing
with that broken-down tub?

480
00:29:19,338 --> 00:29:20,326
Parking it. Why?

481
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:24,126
Get it out of there, or l'll park one
on your chin. l was here first.

482
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,016
Don't look that way to me.

483
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:45,972
Smack him on the chin, boy.
Shoot for his button. Go on! Go on!

484
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:47,124
What's going on?

485
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,093
Well, it ain't the guy selling bananas,
it's a fight! Look!

486
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,972
Get in there, now!
Go ahead, go ahead!

487
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:56,208
Ed, stop yelling out the window.
You're not a truck driver anymore.

488
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,764
Can l help it if l get a little excited?

489
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:01,363
When we got married,
you promised to be a gentleman.

490
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:05,846
lt's disgusting to see the head of a big
company being noisier than his drivers.

491
00:30:07,734 --> 00:30:09,803
One of those guys
looks like Joe Fabrini.

492
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:11,567
lt is Joe!

493
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,204
You remember Joe, don't you?

494
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:15,528
Yeah.

495
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:19,044
And Joe shouldn't be fighting
in the street like that too.

496
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,764
You'll need the other eye for the road.

497
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,571
And this ain't making
either one of us any money.

498
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,051
Look out, Joe.

499
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:33,844
Hey, Joe Fabrini!
Champ!

500
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,281
Hey, Joe!
Joe Fabrini!

501
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,051
Come on up here and see
what you can do with a good man.

502
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,121
l used to could hit like that.
And get hit too.

503
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,805
-Oh, boy.
-ls he coming up?

504
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,404
Yeah, and a great guy he is too.

505
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,525
Say, Lana, what are you doing
with all the dough?

506
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,327
This is 200 bucks this week.

507
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,798
Would you like me to give you
an itemized account?

508
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:01,084
Penny by penny?

509
00:31:01,249 --> 00:31:03,365
Oh, no, sug.
You use all of it you want.

510
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,725
lf you're gonna look like a million,
you got to spend a million, huh?

511
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:10,767
l just got my makeup on. You need to
get romantic around noontime?

512
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,123
Where you're concerned,
l don't watch the clock.

513
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,801
l wish you would.

514
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:17,641
You're having a visitor,
you may as well put your coat on.

515
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:21,004
lf you can't sound like an executive,
you might try looking like one.

516
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:23,158
You're gonna make a gentleman
out of me yet.

517
00:31:23,327 --> 00:31:24,919
l doubt it.

518
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,565
What is it?
What is it?

519
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:32,002
Yes? What--?
Oh, l wish they'd stop inventing things.

520
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:33,999
Joe Fabrini to see you.

521
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:37,322
What?
Oh, well, shoot him right in.

522
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,725
Hello, Joe.
What do you know?

523
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:45,195
Who do you think you are,
Jack Dempsey?

524
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,442
What is that, a gag?

525
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,924
lt's Lana.
She thinks it makes me look dignified.

526
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:53,280
-What was the beef out there?
-Oh, nothing much.

527
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:55,679
-Hello, Mrs. Carlsen.
-Hello.

528
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:59,041
Where have you been hiding? lt's
a wonder you wouldn't come see a guy.

529
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:01,842
-l've been pretty busy.
-The mice must have got into this.

530
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,198
That was no mice, that was a rat.

531
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:07,112
Very funny.
Very funny, babe!

532
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:10,554
That's just like Lana.
Right on the trigger every time.

533
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:13,591
Well, you and l will strike a blow
for liberty.

534
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,436
-You know l never touch it.
-That's all right.

535
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,672
l'll strike the blow for both of us.

536
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,434
Well--

537
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:23,710
Your liver must look like
a bomb hit it.

538
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:29,158
Well, you know what l say,
live and let liver.

539
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:32,951
Or, or, liver,
stay away from my door.

540
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:34,839
lt's a cinch to think of fast ones. . .

541
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:38,471
. . .when you've been married
to a smart girl for seven years.

542
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:41,470
Now, Joe, park it there.

543
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,111
Oh, thanks.
Say, Joe. . .

544
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,515
. . .why don't you cut out trying to beat
this wildcat game and work for me?

545
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,351
-You beat it, didn't you?
-Well, yes.

546
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,754
You're leading with your chin.
Working for me. . .

547
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,434
. . .or any other real trucking outfit,
you can only drive 8 hours at a clip. . .

548
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,908
. . .and you're sure of both your sleep
and your pay.

549
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,996
-You know what l'm gonna do, Ed?
-No.

550
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,275
Paul and me are starting
to buy our own loads.

551
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:09,515
After this, we're gonna make the profits
instead of 1 6 other guys.

552
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:11,868
l'm just getting five
brand-new diesels.

553
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:14,268
l'd sure like to see you and Paul
on one of them.

554
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,076
Thanks, Ed,
but l'd still like to be my own boss.

555
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:19,791
You should listen to Ed.
He's talking sense for once.

556
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,993
Oh, don't get me wrong,
Mrs. Carlsen. . .

557
00:33:22,157 --> 00:33:24,909
. . .l probably sound like l don't appreciate
Ed's offer.

558
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:26,709
l do.

559
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:28,947
But l'd still like to try it my way.

560
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:32,313
Just a few breaks,
and maybe l'll be higher than Ed.

561
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,709
Yeah, and Ed'll be hauling for you.
What do you think of that?

562
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:39,788
-Know where you can buy any loads?
-No, l ain't looked into it yet.

563
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,985
l know just the guy. He knows all
the angles. And since l'm gonna be. . .

564
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,749
. . .working for you someday, l might as
well start getting on your good side.

565
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,711
And you better be nice to him too.

566
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:53,584
-l'm always nice to your friends.
-You see that one? She kills me!

567
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,551
l'll be right back.

568
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:11,471
-Where were you last Thursday?
-On the road, l guess.

569
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,465
You're lying. You were here in town.
One of the boys saw you.

570
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:15,985
So l was in town.

571
00:34:16,152 --> 00:34:19,542
l waited so long in front of that
restaurant, they thought l was a picket.

572
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:21,031
Don't you ever keep a date?

573
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,830
l didn't make a date.

574
00:34:22,992 --> 00:34:24,391
You did.

575
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:26,668
l told you then l wouldn't be there.

576
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,423
And l'm telling you now. . .

577
00:34:28,591 --> 00:34:31,549
-. . .l'll never be there.
-What's the matter with me?

578
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,343
Nothing. . .

579
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:35,905
. . .except you got a husband,
Mrs. Carlsen.

580
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,665
And it happens that he's a good friend
of mine. Understand?

581
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,942
Oh, you've been listening
to some narrow-minded people.

582
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,828
There. What would they say
about that?

583
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,024
You know what's gonna happen
to you?

584
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:54,466
One of these days,
Ed is gonna catch you.

585
00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:58,662
And when he does,
he's gonna slap your ears off.

586
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:01,827
l wonder what l see in you, anyway.

587
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:05,338
You're crude.
You're uneducated.

588
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:08,664
You've never had a pair of pants
with a crease in them.

589
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,057
And yet, l couldn't say no to you.

590
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,298
Don't worry about it.

591
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:15,379
l'm not asking you.

592
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,499
You better get two cases.

593
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,259
Bourbon!

594
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:21,860
-Joe.
-Yes.

595
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:24,142
Go here.
That's the United Warehouse in Pomona.

596
00:35:24,306 --> 00:35:27,901
Ask for Oscar Drake. He's got a load
of lemons he's dying to get rid of.

597
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:31,581
That ain't bad. There's a flu epidemic up
north and they're hot for lemons.

598
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:36,375
The guy's had the fruit laying around for
some time, so you got him over a barrel.

599
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:39,219
-Got any money?
-Enough for a load.

600
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:43,022
-Thanks, Ed. l won't forget this.
-l know.

601
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,413
Goodbye, Mrs. Carlsen.

602
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:48,216
Goodbye.
lt was nice seeing you again, Joe.

603
00:35:48,385 --> 00:35:50,773
Don't forget,
keep your eye on that white line.

604
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:54,621
You betcha.
And l'll watch all the curves too.

605
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,734
Now, there's a great fellow.

606
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:03,453
There's anybody in the world
could beat that wildcat racket, it's him.

607
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:06,183
-Funny how the dames fell for him.
-Can't understand it.

608
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:08,698
Neither can l.
Course, l mean waitresses and such.

609
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:12,617
None of them were high-class broads--
l mean, gals, like yourself.

610
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:16,335
Oh, please, Ed.
Suppose someone should come in?

611
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:20,290
Then we'd have to get married
all over again, wouldn't we?

612
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,538
Yes, thank you.

613
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,418
-Who was it?
-lt was a wire from Joe.

614
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:36,618
He'll be by for you
in about a half an hour.

615
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,853
Paul.

616
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,853
l think you'd better let Joe go on again.
You didn't sleep.

617
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,692
Well, how could l?

618
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,135
Every time l closed my eyes,
l could see those two guys burning.

619
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:49,688
Well, l'm thankful it wasn't you.

620
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:54,613
Every minute, l expect someone to knock
on the door and tell me l'm a widow.

621
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:58,250
-Please stay tonight and get some sleep.
-l can't.

622
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:02,457
l was enough of a heel last night,
walking out on Joe the way l did.

623
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:07,089
l guess l'd try anything
to keep you home one more day.

624
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:09,806
l'm alone so much,
it's got me talking to myself.

625
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,609
Paul.

626
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:13,813
Why can't l have a baby?

627
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:17,208
Maybe then l wouldn't be so. . .so lonely.

628
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:21,611
There you go,
singing the same old song.

629
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:25,611
-You know we can't afford a kid.
-lt's the same old song from you.

630
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,165
How long do you think
l'm gonna stay young enough?

631
00:37:28,336 --> 00:37:31,055
The girls l went to school with
have two or three kids now.

632
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:35,288
The girls you went to school with
were smart to marry guys with real jobs.

633
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:40,530
Paul, l'm not blaming you.
l'm complaining for both of us.

634
00:37:40,695 --> 00:37:43,811
We've got a right to a better life
than this. You could get a job. . .

635
00:37:43,974 --> 00:37:48,445
. . .and though there wasn't much money,
you'd get it every week, be home nights.

636
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:52,129
-Yeah, try and tell that to Joe.
-Who are you married to, Joe or me?

637
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:56,646
l can't leave him out on a limb as long
as he thinks we got a chance in this.

638
00:37:57,134 --> 00:38:00,648
And there he is now. He must have
burned the rubber off that rig.

639
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:06,327
Well, l'll see you in a couple of days.

640
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,483
-Paul, be careful.
-Don't worry, honey.

641
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:10,449
Everything's gonna be all right.

642
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:13,922
Listen, we'll have so many kids,
we'll run out of names.

643
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,805
Hiya, Fabrini.

644
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,646
-Oh, hiya.
-Your truck around?

645
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,166
Yeah. l got it parked
under the kitchen sink.

646
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,367
There's no use getting smart.
l'm acting within my legal rights.

647
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,205
You're three installments behind.
Either you pay or l take the truck!

648
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,644
-You and who else?
-Me.

649
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:43,768
And don't try to get tough about it,
buddy. Where's the truck?

650
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,086
-l don't know.
-lt'll be along.

651
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:50,446
-He and his brother ride together.
-l ain't riding with him anymore.

652
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:52,679
He may not be by here
for a couple of weeks.

653
00:38:52,889 --> 00:38:55,846
That's all right.
We'll wait.

654
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,803
lf you get thirsty,
come on in and l'll give you a mickey.

655
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:06,481
l'm going out the back
and head Joe off at the highway.

656
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:09,366
lf you didn't do anything,
we'd be out of the business.

657
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:12,166
You'd get that job with regular pay,
and be home nights.

658
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:16,206
-lt's what we both want.
-Yeah, that's what l want, all right.

659
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,642
But l don't want to get it
by double-crossing Joe.

660
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:21,195
lf l can save the rig, l gotta save it.

661
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,360
Keep rolling!
Farnsworth's at the house with the law.

662
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,236
Well, he ain't got us this time.

663
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:56,871
What's the difference?
He'll get us the next.

664
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,635
-What are we hauling?
-Lemons.

665
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:01,032
-Who for?
-Ourselves.

666
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,351
What do you mean?

667
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:05,037
l bought the load with the money
we got from Williams.

668
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,955
-All of it?
-All of it.

669
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:09,238
Except 2 bucks for rolling dough.

670
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:11,916
-l bought the stuff for 80 cents a box.
-Are you nuts?

671
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:15,791
Relax, will you? When we sell the load,
we'll have twice what we started with.

672
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,031
You mean, if we sell the load.

673
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:20,920
Hey, don't l rate in this outfit?
What am l, just a stooge?

674
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,151
Half of that dough was mine.
Mine and Pearl's.

675
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,197
Don't l even get asked
about anything?

676
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,272
A guy's gotta be around
before you ask him.

677
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,475
Yeah, l'm sorry about that.
l shouldn't have walked out on you, Joe.

678
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,551
That's all right.

679
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,474
l almost threw in the towel myself.

680
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,713
Well, did you see
any of your old girlfriends in L.A.?

681
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,995
Nope.
Didn't have time.

682
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,751
What do you mean?

683
00:40:45,919 --> 00:40:48,990
Joe Fabrini didn't have time
to see even one dame?

684
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,149
You heard me.

685
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:57,106
lt's just like l've been saying.
This business is really tearing us down.

686
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:06,314
-Hiya, boys. What do you got?
-A load of lemons. Wanna see them?

687
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:09,867
l really don't want no lemons,
but l guess it won't hurt if l take a look.

688
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:11,789
You can have a look.

689
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:16,272
-How's the market?
-Oh, only fair.

690
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,109
Drop it right down there.

691
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:21,227
-Hear you got married.
-Oh, forget that.

692
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:25,867
-Nice stuff, eh?
-This ain't no lemon, this is a lemonette.

693
00:41:26,036 --> 00:41:27,071
Don't try to kid us.

694
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:31,785
-We know good stuff when we see it.
-l hate lemons, even if they're good.

695
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:33,991
Quit stalling, George.
How do you like them?

696
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:36,191
lt all depends
upon what you're asking, boys.

697
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:40,552
-Well, we'll leave that up to you.
-Since you come to see me first. . .

698
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,989
-. . .l'll give you $3.50 a box.
-Oh, no. No deal.

699
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:45,030
Come on, give me a hand, Paul.

700
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,427
Wait a minute, boys.

701
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:50,983
l'll treat you right, you know that.
Name your own price.

702
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:54,589
Well, we hauled this stuff a long way
and we paid a good price for them.

703
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:59,827
-We figure they're worth 5 bucks a box.
-You got me mixed up with Santa Claus.

704
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,550
Okay.
No hard feelings.

705
00:42:02,712 --> 00:42:07,866
Come on, Paul. We'll take them down to
Riley's. We might even get 6 from him.

706
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:10,906
l tell you what l'll do, guys.

707
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,988
l'll give you $4 a box,
but l want you to throw in some fill-ins.

708
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:19,110
We bought 1 45 boxes,
and that's what we're selling.

709
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:23,503
Okay, robber.
1 45 boxes. . .

710
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:28,506
. . .at $4 a box is 580 simoleons.
That's all you'll get.

711
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,066
l don't know, George, l. . . .

712
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,819
All right, it's a deal.

713
00:42:40,629 --> 00:42:43,745
Hey, Junior, Harvey!
Dump that load.

714
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:47,345
-l'll get you your money.
-All right, George.

715
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,657
Here, you always liked apples.

716
00:42:54,228 --> 00:42:56,788
l hope l never have another 5 minutes
like that again.

717
00:42:56,948 --> 00:43:00,860
We made 500 profit on the deal. We
should have a lot of 5 minutes like that.

718
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:04,224
-Well, we're finally rolling.
-lt looks that way. What next?

719
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:07,219
We'll buy another load.
Then we'll buy some more loads.

720
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:10,059
Then we'll buy another truck.
Then buy some more trucks.

721
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:13,105
Whoa, wait a minute.
Maybe we better pay for this one first.

722
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:15,541
Don't worry.
We'll send Farnsworth dough tomorrow.

723
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,458
One, two, three, four, five. . .

724
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:19,617
. . .twenty, forty, sixty, eighty.

725
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:21,538
-580.
-Thanks.

726
00:43:21,706 --> 00:43:24,981
lf you guys got any more good loads,
don't forget l treated you right.

727
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,215
We'll come straight to you.

728
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:29,576
Come on, l wanna use the phone.

729
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:34,262
-Give me a flock of change, Leo.
-Say, who you calling?

730
00:43:34,424 --> 00:43:36,301
-Cassie.
-Cassie? Who's that?

731
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:38,217
That gal we picked up on the road.

732
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:40,102
l just wanna find out
how she's doing.

733
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:42,255
l thought nothing happened
with that dame.

734
00:43:42,424 --> 00:43:44,380
Nothing did.

735
00:43:44,824 --> 00:43:47,383
But l ain't saying nothing won't.

736
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,619
Give me long distance.

737
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:59,135
Hello. Hello, Joe? Did something happen
to you? You weren't in a. . .?

738
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:02,294
No, nothing happened.
Nothing bad, anyway.

739
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:05,022
l was scared when she told me
San Francisco was calling.

740
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:08,060
-l knew it was you or about you.
-How did you know?

741
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:10,611
Oh, l just knew.
ls everything all right?

742
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:15,093
Everything's great. We got more dough
than we ever seen before.

743
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,853
Say. . .

744
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,659
. . .this is a funny time
to call up a girl, ain't it?

745
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,130
Oh, l don't mind. l'm glad you called.
l was worried about you.

746
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,092
Oh, Cassie. . .

747
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,331
. . .do you believe in
love at first sight?

748
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:30,814
Well, it saves a lot of time.

749
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:34,052
-When are you coming back?
-l think l wanna get back and see you. . .

750
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,098
-. . .as fast as we can buy another load.
-Be careful and don't drive too fast.

751
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,648
l want to see you quick,
but all in one piece.

752
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:44,168
<i>Your three minutes are up. Deposit
50 cents for an additional minute.</i>

753
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:45,857
Don't spend any more.

754
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:49,055
When you get back we can talk
all you want, and it won't cost a--

755
00:44:49,218 --> 00:44:50,776
Hello?

756
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,655
Hello?

757
00:44:55,457 --> 00:44:57,926
Give me a cup of coffee, Leo.

758
00:45:00,257 --> 00:45:01,929
That was great talk.

759
00:45:02,097 --> 00:45:05,806
Pearl and me used to have them same
conversations before we got married.

760
00:45:05,977 --> 00:45:07,773
Who said anything
about getting married?

761
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:11,212
Nobody, but you can't horse me.
l know that rash when l see it.

762
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,606
lt all depends on how smart
the dame is.

763
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:16,448
Oh, your brakes are dragging. l--

764
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,251
Our rig's moving!

765
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,974
-Hey, where do you think you're going?
-Out of the truck!

766
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:29,126
-But. . . .
-You, out the other side!

767
00:45:29,335 --> 00:45:31,565
Now, fellas,
l'm strictly within my legal rights.

768
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:34,567
You'd look pretty silly with a monkey
wrench out of your head.

769
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:37,771
-l'll call a policeman!
-lf l touch you, you'll call an ambulance.

770
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:40,242
-How much do we owe you?
-$300 plus $50 interest.

771
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:43,132
-Sure you ain't gypping yourself?
-Where's that loan paper?

772
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:45,966
-Right here.
-Mark on it ''paid in full'' in big letters. . .

773
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:48,521
. . .because that's
what you're getting, cash.

774
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:53,164
One, two, three, twenty, forty, sixty.
Here. Give me a 1 0.

775
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,403
You understand,
there's nothing personal.

776
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:58,882
Yeah, we understand. We love you too.
Now get out of here.

777
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:03,170
-You don't have to be nasty about it.
-We don't have to be, but it's more fun.

778
00:46:03,332 --> 00:46:06,528
What do you say
we throw this monkey over the truck?

779
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:13,003
Well, baby, you're all ours.

780
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,486
-l never thought l'd live to see this day.
-And you're gonna live to see better.

781
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,722
Come on. We just got enough dough left
to buy another load.

782
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:40,359
Hiya, Fabrini.
Got that dough you owe me?

783
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:43,565
-Yeah. l'm gonna pay you in full.
-l congratulate myself.

784
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:45,241
-What are you hauling?
-Pears.

785
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:47,638
Oh, fill it up with gas.

786
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:52,285
Well, l see Paul's asleep again,
as usual.

787
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:55,245
What is it about my brother sleeping
that annoys you so much?

788
00:46:55,407 --> 00:46:58,240
You've always got your nose
in everybody else's business.

789
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:00,796
-Come on, fill her up.
-Okay.

790
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:02,115
lf it was me. . .

791
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:06,074
. . .l'd get a little sleep once in a while
myself and let him do some driving.

792
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:08,678
Paul?

793
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:11,036
-Paul!
-Yeah.

794
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:13,003
Yeah, what, what's the matter?

795
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,164
Nothing, but you'd better take the wheel
for a while.

796
00:47:16,326 --> 00:47:17,917
l'm knocked out.

797
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,155
Where are we, Haig's?

798
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:24,557
What do you say you and l stop over
and grab a couple hours of shuteye?

799
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:27,841
For the first time in our lives,
we get ahead of this racket. . .

800
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:30,598
-. . .and he wants to stop and sleep.
-Sure, l wanna sleep.

801
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,880
Everyone sleeps
once in a while, remember?

802
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:35,841
You'd think l wanted
to do something peculiar.

803
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,148
-You all right?
-Yeah.

804
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,910
l'm all right.

805
00:48:40,078 --> 00:48:41,716
But my brother's in the truck!

806
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:43,948
Shoot your lights down there.

807
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:55,555
Come on. Come on.
Hold it.

808
00:49:09,436 --> 00:49:10,664
Paul!

809
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:12,951
-Paul!
-l'll go and get help.

810
00:49:13,115 --> 00:49:14,707
Paul!

811
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,472
Joe, how is he?

812
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:25,512
Busted up, but he's gonna be okay.

813
00:49:25,675 --> 00:49:28,393
At first they thought his skull
was fractured, but it ain't.

814
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:30,510
-Where is he?
-Down here.

815
00:49:31,154 --> 00:49:33,509
lt was all my fault.
He wanted to stop and sleep. . .

816
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:36,062
-. . .and l made him drive.
-Don't blame yourself, Joe.

817
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,827
lt was bound to happen.
l'm grateful he's alive.

818
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:41,063
-The truck's gone, l suppose.
-Complete wreck.

819
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:45,430
Load smashed, not a cent of insurance.
And we were just starting to do good.

820
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:47,025
lt's always that way, isn't it?

821
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,660
You and Paul will get another truck
and be back on the road.

822
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:53,507
-Wait, Pearl. Before you go in.
-Yes?

823
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:56,470
Looks like Paul's gonna be out of work
for some time.

824
00:49:56,632 --> 00:49:58,224
And l don't want you to worry, see.

825
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:02,261
While he's getting well,
l'll take care of everything.

826
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,820
What are you trying to do, Joe,
soften the blow?

827
00:50:04,991 --> 00:50:06,868
-How bad is he?
-Oh, he's all right.

828
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:10,818
A couple of cuts here and there.
All except his right arm.

829
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,708
They thought. . . .

830
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,065
Well, they had to do it.

831
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:20,268
l'm gonna surprise you.
l'm gonna surprise you a lot.

832
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,185
l'm almost glad it happened!

833
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,342
-You're what?
-You heard me, l'm almost glad.

834
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:29,899
Now he can't drive a truck anymore.
Now he'll be home nights.

835
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,502
Now l won't always
be alone, worrying.

836
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:35,137
Maybe it's worth a right arm, Joe.

837
00:50:35,308 --> 00:50:37,299
Maybe it's worth it.

838
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,603
-Hello, sug.
-Don't you ever knock?

839
00:50:52,764 --> 00:50:55,358
Oh, it's all right. We're married.
Don't you remember?

840
00:50:55,524 --> 00:50:57,718
Yeah, how can l forget?

841
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,321
Well, what are you gonna do,
open up a shop?

842
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:04,273
Where's the pole
that goes with this?

843
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,911
Oh, to show you how things break
in this business. . .

844
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:10,310
. . .you know what happened?

845
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:13,633
Last night, the Fabrini brothers
smacked up, truck and all.

846
00:51:13,802 --> 00:51:17,238
-Was Joe hurt?
-No. He got scratched up a little.

847
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:19,313
His brother lost a wing.

848
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,880
-What are they gonna do?
-Joe's gonna wheel a truck for me.

849
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,197
He's a good man
and l hate to get him that way.

850
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:28,954
lf he's a good man,
why are you wasting him on the road?

851
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,872
Where else am l gonna put him?

852
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,395
Anyone with a big back
can drive a truck.

853
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,312
Why don't you put him
in the garage?

854
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,357
ln the garage?
What would he do there?

855
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,715
l don't know.
There must be a lot of things.

856
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,235
You're always complaining
how tired you are.

857
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,152
Maybe if you had someone
to help you. . .

858
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,514
. . .you wouldn't always fall asleep
after dinner.

859
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:49,113
You know, sug,
that ain't a bad idea of yours.

860
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:52,073
-Always thinking of the old man, huh?
-Sure l am, Ed.

861
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,706
But you never give me any credit
for it.

862
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,756
-Brakes? Hand brake?
-Check. Check.

863
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,385
-Tires? Spare tires?
-Check. Check.

864
00:52:10,557 --> 00:52:11,592
-Everything set?
-Fine.

865
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:14,954
-Okay, Sweeney, let her roll.
-All right, Joe.

866
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:21,708
Joe!

867
00:52:23,356 --> 00:52:25,312
-ls Ed ready?
-l don't know, Mrs. Carlsen.

868
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:29,263
-l'll go and see.
-Never mind. He'll be down.

869
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:31,267
Got a match?

870
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,631
No lighter in this car?

871
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:38,672
lt doesn't work.

872
00:52:38,995 --> 00:52:42,031
Did Ed tell you about our anniversary
party tomorrow night?

873
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:45,584
-l'm sorry, l can't make it.
-But Ed's counting on having you!

874
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:47,233
-Weren't you, Ed?
-Sure.

875
00:52:47,394 --> 00:52:50,783
-What is it, and how much does it cost?
-Joe says he can't make our party.

876
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:53,467
Sure you can. lt's our new house.
l want you to see it.

877
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:56,670
l gave it to Lana as a surprise,
after she picked it out.

878
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:58,903
l had something planned
with Paul tomorrow.

879
00:52:59,073 --> 00:53:01,507
Look here, l'm boss.
This is a royal command.

880
00:53:01,673 --> 00:53:05,950
You show up at my new dump tomorrow
night. Paul don't pay your salary, l do.

881
00:53:06,112 --> 00:53:08,546
Okay, l'll show up,
but l've gotta leave early.

882
00:53:08,712 --> 00:53:12,182
l knew Ed could bring you around.
He must have more appeal than l have.

883
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:13,989
She's terrific.

884
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:16,711
lf you open your mouth,
she puts her foot in it.

885
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,387
Here comes work.
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.

886
00:53:20,551 --> 00:53:22,381
See you tomorrow, Ed.

887
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:29,268
Right on the nose, lrish. They must've
taken out the pinball machines.

888
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:32,502
They're getting tougher. They got
a new one, if you hit a winner. . .

889
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,707
. . .it mixes you a drink, tucks you
into bed, but nobody ever wins.

890
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,906
-Hi, lrish!
-Hello, Ed.

891
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:43,222
Funny. She almost never used to call
for Ed nights until you started here.

892
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:46,664
-Or am l talking out of turn?
-Come on, get washed up.

893
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,739
-We're going to Paul's for dinner.
-Again?

894
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:50,706
lt's sure nice
since he moved into town.

895
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:54,464
-Yeah. Pearl's cooking a steak.
-Swell! Ain't had a steak since breakfast.

896
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:59,501
Oh, boy, l'm hungry!

897
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:03,906
-l wonder what they'll have for dessert.
-For you, probably stewed pinballs.

898
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,335
-Hello, baby.
-Hello, Joe.

899
00:54:09,027 --> 00:54:11,586
-That's nice.
-How'd you get here so early?

900
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:13,577
l got a lift from one of the girls.

901
00:54:13,746 --> 00:54:15,702
-How are you, lrish?
-Hungry.

902
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:17,141
-Hiya, fellas.
-Hello, Paul.

903
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:19,297
Hello, Paul.
Any luck today?

904
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,424
Yeah, but all bad. All the old men
get the watchman's jobs. . .

905
00:54:22,586 --> 00:54:25,225
. . .and that's about the only thing
a one-armed guy can do.

906
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:29,344
There are a lot of jobs you can handle.
Hey, Pearl, medium-rare on my steak. . .

907
00:54:29,505 --> 00:54:31,257
. . .and not much butter
on my potatoes.

908
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:33,381
Any special design you want
on the plate?

909
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:36,775
-Come on, everybody, sit down.
-You don't have to call me twice.

910
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:40,857
When l was riding that truck, l used to
think l'd never get enough staying home.

911
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:44,494
-l got enough, all right.
-Relax, you'll find something to do.

912
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:48,418
Sure. l can always learn to knit,
and Ripley'll print my picture.

913
00:54:48,584 --> 00:54:50,495
Have some steak, Cassie,
and pass it on.

914
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:53,496
-How's things going at the store?
-Fine, except l get tired. . .

915
00:54:53,663 --> 00:54:56,382
-. . .of being on my feet all day.
-l got the same trouble.

916
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,932
The only difference is,
l drive all day.

917
00:55:00,302 --> 00:55:01,735
-Beer, lrish?
-That's me, kid.

918
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:04,177
l'm the best two-fisted beer drinker
in America.

919
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,776
Sometimes l get so thirsty,
l wish l had three hands.

920
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:11,136
-Cut it.
-That's okay. He didn't mean no harm.

921
00:55:11,302 --> 00:55:14,578
He's right. Three hands
are better than two, ain't they?

922
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:18,700
-Just like two hands are better than one.
-Take it easy, fella.

923
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:20,615
Easy?

924
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:23,977
Yeah, that's a nice word. Maybe
you think it's easy being helpless. . .

925
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,256
. . .waiting for Pearl to dress me
and feed me. . .

926
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,936
. . .sitting around all day, wondering what
a guy with no right arm is good for.

927
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,896
Why'd you ever cut me
out of that wreck?

928
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,175
This way, she don't even get
no life insurance.

929
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:39,049
-lt don't help to get excited.
-lt's all well for you, you're in one piece.

930
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,009
You don't have to take nobody's charity
like l gotta take yours.

931
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:49,733
l guess he's been moping
around the house too much.

932
00:55:49,898 --> 00:55:52,571
After we eat, we'll go out
and have some nightlife.

933
00:55:52,738 --> 00:55:55,206
Maybe that'll cheer him up
a little, huh?

934
00:56:02,457 --> 00:56:05,529
-l ain't danced in a long time.
-Me neither, and l used to love it.

935
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:07,972
lt's the most fun you can have
without laughing.

936
00:56:08,137 --> 00:56:09,775
Take a lot to get me laughing.

937
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:12,609
Say, what do you say
we get married?

938
00:56:12,776 --> 00:56:16,052
l'd like that fine, but you've got enough
responsibilities right now. . .

939
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:18,491
. . .with the hospital bills
and Paul out of work.

940
00:56:18,656 --> 00:56:20,486
Yeah, l wish l could
find him something.

941
00:56:20,655 --> 00:56:22,771
Why don't you change your mind
and ask Ed?

942
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,891
l'd like to, but l can't.

943
00:56:25,055 --> 00:56:27,888
Paul ain't able to do a hard day's work
at the garage yet.

944
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,010
Ed's been too swell as it is.

945
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:34,373
-Guess we gotta just keep on hoping.
-Joe, do me a favor, will you?

946
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:37,367
Take me dancing again tomorrow night
when we both feel better.

947
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,126
Okay.

948
00:56:39,694 --> 00:56:44,324
Oh, l can't. l gotta go
to the boss's house to a party.

949
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:48,007
Don't say ''oh'' like you think
l'm walking out on you.

950
00:56:48,173 --> 00:56:50,482
-l don't wanna go.
-l didn't say you did.

951
00:56:50,693 --> 00:56:53,809
Let's sit down.
lf we stay here, we'll be fighting.

952
00:56:53,972 --> 00:56:57,966
l'm sorry, kid.
l guess l got the jitters tonight.

953
00:56:58,453 --> 00:57:00,921
-Where's lrish?
-He's wandering around all over.

954
00:57:01,092 --> 00:57:03,401
Yeah, he's doing a little hunting.

955
00:57:03,572 --> 00:57:05,722
Looks like
he bagged something special.

956
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,762
Hello, folks.
This is. . . .

957
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:11,161
-Say, what's your name?
-Miss Sue Carter.

958
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:15,244
-Sue Carter.
-Any friend of his is a friend of mine.

959
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:18,406
-What's your name?
-What's the difference?

960
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,283
Sit down and have a drink.
Drinking makes you beautiful.

961
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,965
-l haven't been drinking.
-l know, but l have.

962
00:57:24,171 --> 00:57:26,240
Leave it to lrish to find romance.

963
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,680
Don't she look like a million bucks?

964
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,479
And just as hard to get.

965
00:57:43,648 --> 00:57:46,367
-Wanna come up for a while?
-l don't think so, not tonight.

966
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:49,520
-l'll make you some coffee.
-l don't want any. lt keeps me awake.

967
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,480
Still worried about Paul?

968
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:52,797
Yeah.

969
00:57:52,968 --> 00:57:55,243
Are you too worried to kiss me?

970
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:57,285
Not that bad.

971
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:05,718
-What's the matter, you stop loving me?
-No, darling, but l still have to breathe.

972
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:09,720
Cassie, you're the only girl in this world
l've ever been crazy about.

973
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:14,322
You're the only fella in the world who
could make me believe a lie like that.

974
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:16,441
Come on.
Come up and have some coffee.

975
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:18,881
No, no coffee.

976
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:23,082
Yes, sir!
That's what l always tell my drivers.

977
00:58:23,245 --> 00:58:26,681
No phone pole ever hit a truck
unless it was in self-defense.

978
00:58:28,165 --> 00:58:31,122
l think the guy that wired this
must have baled hay.

979
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,442
There.

980
00:58:34,604 --> 00:58:36,435
Now, get a load--
Wait a minute, now.

981
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:39,122
Ed.

982
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:40,955
We have servants to open the wine.

983
00:58:41,123 --> 00:58:44,480
What's the fun of having champagne
if you can't pop the cork yourself?

984
00:58:44,644 --> 00:58:48,238
Here now, lrish, that ain't beer,
so don't start guzzling it.

985
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:51,122
And you and your truck driver friends
stop drinking so much.

986
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:53,956
This is the only eighth anniversary
we're ever gonna have.

987
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:56,192
Come on, we gotta celebrate.

988
00:58:57,842 --> 00:58:59,560
-Evening, Mrs. Carlsen.
-You're late.

989
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:01,838
-Oh, l got stuck at the office.
-l'm sorry. . .

990
00:59:02,002 --> 00:59:05,994
-. . .l forgot to tell you we were dressing.
-Well, l'm not up in that bracket yet.

991
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:07,719
-Hello, Joe!
-Hello, Ed.

992
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,473
-A glass of champagne?
-No, thanks.

993
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:11,632
-You know Joe never takes a drink.
-l know.

994
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:14,713
He's like me. l don't either,
unless l got a glass in each hand.

995
00:59:14,881 --> 00:59:16,633
Don't have any bad habits,
do you, Joe?

996
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:18,995
None that l can't handle,
Mrs. Carlsen.

997
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,991
Joe, how do you like the dump?

998
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,594
-l think it's swell.
-You wanna know something?

999
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,672
Lana decorated it
all by her itty-bitty self.

1000
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:29,307
Early American bargain-basement.

1001
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,947
You ain't saw it.
You ain't seen it too, lrish.

1002
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:33,188
-Come on, l'll--
-Ed.

1003
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,235
Don't you think
Joe ought to meet guests?

1004
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:37,549
What's the use?
He'll only forget their names.

1005
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,789
-Culpepper, l sure thirsty.
-Yes, sir.

1006
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:42,154
Charles, bring Mr. Carlsen
some water, will you?

1007
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,467
Yes, ma'am.

1008
00:59:43,638 --> 00:59:45,390
l said thirsty, didn't l?
Not dirty.

1009
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:48,356
lf you fall on your face,
don't expect me to drag you to bed.

1010
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,112
Don't worry about me.
lf l fall, l'll fall upstairs.

1011
00:59:51,277 --> 00:59:53,108
Come on, Joe.

1012
00:59:55,597 --> 00:59:57,792
See, Joe,
we had all the screens removed. . .

1013
00:59:57,957 --> 01:00:00,754
. . .because they were fixed
so the flies can't get out at all.

1014
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:04,353
-Hey, this leaves me speechless.
-Good. Stay that way.

1015
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,588
Well, there you are.
Swimming puddle and everything.

1016
01:00:07,756 --> 01:00:10,668
Hot, cold running water.
Guess l'll have to learn how to swim.

1017
01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:13,555
-Well, right this way.
-You sure got a nice layout here, Ed.

1018
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:17,390
Someday you'll have one just like it,
and a swell wife like Lana to go with it.

1019
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:20,706
-Yeah, that would be nice.
-Yes, sir--

1020
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,831
And here we have a badminton court.

1021
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:26,225
Great game. A couple of guys
chase a feather with fly swatters. . .

1022
01:00:26,394 --> 01:00:29,625
. . .and the one that don't drop dead
wins the game!

1023
01:00:29,795 --> 01:00:30,944
Come here.

1024
01:00:32,234 --> 01:00:35,465
And, Joe, there's something else
l sure want you to get a gander at.

1025
01:00:35,634 --> 01:00:39,752
Around a place like this, there's always a
lot of confusion about bushes and trees.

1026
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:42,382
Avocados, male and female.

1027
01:00:42,593 --> 01:00:45,585
-How can you tell?
-Oh, that's easy.

1028
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:48,061
The bashful one's the girl.

1029
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:53,501
And now for the topper.

1030
01:00:54,992 --> 01:00:58,348
You know how you drive up, and you've
got to get out and open the doors?

1031
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:01,663
That ain't for me. Get a load of this.

1032
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:10,062
-Say, l'm speechless.
-That's where we came in.

1033
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,979
Now you see, all you've got to do
is drive or walk between the posts. . .

1034
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:18,428
. . .break the ray, and the doors start
swinging. Want to see me close them?

1035
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:27,345
Say, what will they think
of inventing next?

1036
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,943
l understand some guy's
working on a sundial.

1037
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:34,148
Oh, lrish, don't talk silly.
Who'd want to dial the sun?

1038
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:40,697
-Good night, Ed. l had a swell time.
-You're going so soon?

1039
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,587
l've got to be at the office at 6:30.
Good night, everybody.

1040
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:45,544
-Good night.
-See you in the morning.

1041
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:47,026
-Good night, Joe.
-Good night.

1042
01:01:47,187 --> 01:01:49,941
-Good night.
-l certainly am.

1043
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,977
-Joe, you're not going.
-Yes, l told you l had to leave early.

1044
01:01:55,147 --> 01:01:58,344
Well, l'll walk out with you.
l need some air.

1045
01:02:02,026 --> 01:02:04,256
lt's chilly. Don't you think
you'd better go in?

1046
01:02:04,426 --> 01:02:06,621
No, it feels good.

1047
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:13,024
-l had a nice time, Mrs. Carlsen.
-Do you have to call me Mrs. Carlsen?

1048
01:02:13,185 --> 01:02:14,698
You know, l have a first name.

1049
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:17,459
When l call you Mrs. Carlsen,
that keeps me in my place.

1050
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:20,458
Wouldn't be trying to get over
it also keeps me in my place?

1051
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:23,298
-That ain't what l said.
-l can read between the lines.

1052
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:27,783
-Joe, what is it? What's wrong?
-Nothing wrong that l know of.

1053
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,855
Then why do you keep acting like this?

1054
01:02:30,024 --> 01:02:32,458
Why do you keep pretending
you don't even notice me?

1055
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,659
Now look, who do you
think you're fooling?

1056
01:02:34,863 --> 01:02:38,253
l'm not fooling anybody,
and that includes you and me both.

1057
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:40,414
Listen, Joe, please.

1058
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:44,622
lf l told you once, l told you 50 times,
l'm doing good at the office. . .

1059
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,217
. . .and l'm not playing around
with the boss's wife.

1060
01:02:47,383 --> 01:02:52,137
Ed's been always all right with me,
and l'm never gonna be wrong with him.

1061
01:02:54,782 --> 01:02:56,340
How touching.

1062
01:02:56,502 --> 01:02:59,937
The faithful employee.
The devoted friend.

1063
01:03:00,101 --> 01:03:01,978
That's me.

1064
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:04,770
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen.

1065
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,612
Mrs. Carlsen.

1066
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,700
Mrs.

1067
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,056
Mrs.

1068
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,898
Listen. Listen, now. Listen.
l'm gonna drink you all a little toast.

1069
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,573
-Just a little toast.
-A toast.

1070
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:29,974
Early to rise and early to bed
makes a man healthy, but socially dead.

1071
01:03:31,258 --> 01:03:33,647
Now l'm gonna take you all
to the Tango Club.

1072
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,572
Tango Club! Tango Club.

1073
01:03:36,739 --> 01:03:41,175
Oh, sugar, listen, will you rush out
and leap into that ermine gunnysack?

1074
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:44,648
-We're gonna sneak up on a rumba.
-What's the matter, not enough liquor?

1075
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:48,332
Maybe you'd like to put
a still in the basement.

1076
01:03:48,497 --> 01:03:49,976
Never at a loss for a comeback.

1077
01:03:50,137 --> 01:03:54,607
We're married eight years,
and she still tickles me pink.

1078
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:56,846
Shut up, Ed.

1079
01:03:57,016 --> 01:03:59,325
You don't want to dance?
She don't care to dance.

1080
01:03:59,496 --> 01:04:01,612
l always get a partner.

1081
01:04:01,776 --> 01:04:04,051
Oh, well, then you'll do.

1082
01:04:20,854 --> 01:04:23,732
-Ed, pay the check.
-No, that's one thing l'm not gonna do.

1083
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26,328
The liquor is no good.
You can't get drunk on it.

1084
01:04:26,494 --> 01:04:29,645
Then someone must have hit you
over the head with a mallet.

1085
01:04:31,374 --> 01:04:33,126
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, madam.

1086
01:04:33,294 --> 01:04:36,330
Someone help me get him
out of here. l'll drive him home.

1087
01:04:36,493 --> 01:04:39,724
-You're lucky l stayed sober.
-lt certainly does.

1088
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:41,565
Come on. Come on.

1089
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:44,166
-l don't want to dance now.
-Very well.

1090
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:48,245
-Come on, Ed. The air will do you good.
-Oh, l don't know. What's the trouble?

1091
01:04:48,412 --> 01:04:50,687
Who's--? What's going on here?

1092
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:56,882
Oh, it's a shame, a fine fellow
like the boss disgracing himself in public.

1093
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:58,849
Yeah.

1094
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:18,122
Come on. Sit up, you drunken pig.

1095
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,484
Let's go in the office
and take a little snooze.

1096
01:05:20,969 --> 01:05:23,881
Come on, get up and walk,
or do l have to carry you?

1097
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:27,883
No, l'm just gonna catch a little snooze.

1098
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,993
Needless to say, Mrs. Carlsen, l regret
having to go through this formality.

1099
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,072
He was so drunk.

1100
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:21,871
l always told him something awful would
happen if he kept drinking that way.

1101
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:26,077
Naturally, l couldn't lift
such a heavy man out of the car.

1102
01:07:26,238 --> 01:07:28,354
He'd stayed in the garage before. . .

1103
01:07:28,518 --> 01:07:31,590
. . .but he always came in the house
when he sobered up.

1104
01:07:31,758 --> 01:07:34,988
-This time, he--
-Don't distress yourself, Mrs. Carlsen.

1105
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:36,386
Just take your time.

1106
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:41,872
This time, he must have awakened
still drunk and started the car.

1107
01:07:42,037 --> 01:07:46,588
Oh, it's awful.
He wanted so much to live.

1108
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:50,749
-He had everything to live for.
-Thank you, Mrs. Carlsen.

1109
01:07:50,916 --> 01:07:54,431
l regret that l've been forced to
question you. l won't bother you further.

1110
01:07:54,596 --> 01:07:57,553
-You're very kind.
-Please accept my sincerest sympathy.

1111
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:59,546
Thank you.

1112
01:08:00,475 --> 01:08:03,309
The cause of death was accidental,
carbon monoxide poisoning.

1113
01:08:03,476 --> 01:08:05,353
Close the case.

1114
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:26,548
-Stop creeping around the house.
-l wasn't creeping. Honest, l wasn't.

1115
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:29,592
-l don't want you snooping around.
-l wasn't doing no snooping.

1116
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:31,471
l come in to see
if you wanted coffee.

1117
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:34,067
l've had four cups. l don't want any
more, you hear?

1118
01:08:34,233 --> 01:08:35,461
-Well, do you hear?!
-Yes.

1119
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:37,908
Now get out of my sight,
and stop sneaking around!

1120
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,540
l don't want you spying on me!

1121
01:08:51,871 --> 01:08:54,543
You were supposed
to be here at 1 0:00.

1122
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,906
One of our drivers crashed
into a load of pipe--

1123
01:08:57,071 --> 01:09:01,542
-l don't care about that.
-The driver don't, either. He's dead.

1124
01:09:01,711 --> 01:09:06,738
Oh, l'm sorry, Joe. Being alone
in this big house gives me the willies.

1125
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,821
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thanks.

1126
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:11,139
Oh, that's right. l forgot.

1127
01:09:11,309 --> 01:09:13,379
Sit down, Joe.

1128
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:17,420
What was this business
you wanted to talk to me about?

1129
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:22,497
Look, Joe, l don't know anything
about the company.

1130
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:26,179
l've tried to understand, and the
lawyers have explained things to me.

1131
01:09:26,349 --> 01:09:29,977
The more they talk, the less l know.
l can't run a trucking business by myself.

1132
01:09:30,148 --> 01:09:32,264
l've got to have someone to help me.

1133
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:35,976
-Does that mean me?
-Yes. Ed had such confidence in you.

1134
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:40,459
He said you had great ideas.
l know he'd want you to be my partner.

1135
01:09:40,627 --> 01:09:43,504
-Partner?
-Yes, partner. 50-50.

1136
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:47,022
l've got the papers all drawn up,
and all you have to do is. . . .

1137
01:09:48,026 --> 01:09:52,577
What's wrong? Don't you want to own
half of the big trucking business?

1138
01:09:52,746 --> 01:09:57,342
With anyone else, l'd think it
was a swell deal, but you. . . .

1139
01:09:58,226 --> 01:10:01,501
-l don't know.
-Why not, Joe?

1140
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:04,896
lt's good for me because if l don't
get help, l'll lose the business.

1141
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:07,862
lt's good for you because
you'll never get this chance again.

1142
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:11,255
-No interference?
-None. l promise you, Joe.

1143
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,461
l don't know anything about trucks.
How could l interfere?

1144
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:18,299
-l wasn't talking about trucks.
-Oh, you've got to help me, Joe.

1145
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,820
l haven't anyone else
in the world to turn to.

1146
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,655
Well, what's it gonna be?

1147
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:26,621
lf it's gonna be like you say,
you can count me in.

1148
01:10:26,783 --> 01:10:29,855
Oh, l'm so glad, Joe.
Neither of us will regret it.

1149
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:32,855
Now, how about that drink
to celebrate, just this once?

1150
01:10:33,022 --> 01:10:36,458
-Okay. l'll take a short one.
-lt's gonna work out fine, Joe.

1151
01:10:36,622 --> 01:10:39,852
l know it will. And it's what Ed
would have wanted.

1152
01:10:40,021 --> 01:10:41,977
Maybe you're right.

1153
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:46,460
Well. . .

1154
01:10:46,662 --> 01:10:50,131
. . .here's to our partnership.
May it be a long and happy one.

1155
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:53,213
lt could work out pretty good.

1156
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:00,455
l'll tell you what we'll do. We'll
figure out new lines, buy new trucks.

1157
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,692
We'll get business we never even
thought about. We'll go a long way.

1158
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,611
Yes, we will.

1159
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,608
-Hey, Joe, who sneaked those rigs in?
-New refrigerator jobs.

1160
01:11:15,779 --> 01:11:17,929
Opens up a lot of dairy
business for us.

1161
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:20,737
l don't know where l'm gonna get
20 drivers to wheel them.

1162
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:24,334
-ls Bill McGowan a good driver?
-l don't want to say anything bad. . .

1163
01:11:24,498 --> 01:11:28,206
. . .but when the road turns the same time
he does, it's just a coincidence.

1164
01:11:28,377 --> 01:11:29,776
Yeah, that's what l thought.

1165
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:32,651
-What's the trouble?
-Got to clean and adjust the points.

1166
01:11:32,817 --> 01:11:35,890
-How long will it take?
-About 1 5 minutes.

1167
01:11:36,857 --> 01:11:38,848
Hello, Joe.

1168
01:11:40,257 --> 01:11:42,088
How are you?

1169
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:46,613
-These the new trucks?
-Yeah. l see you got a new buggy.

1170
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:49,768
-Blowing all the profits?
-We're making a lot of profits to blow.

1171
01:11:49,936 --> 01:11:51,449
Why not?

1172
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:54,527
Say, that's a snappy outfit.

1173
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:57,693
You like it?
l didn't think you'd notice.

1174
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,369
lt isn't too soon for me to stop
wearing black, is it?

1175
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:02,930
-No, l don't think so.
-That's the way l felt.

1176
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:07,725
Take a good look. You're not gonna see
me in the same outfit twice for months.

1177
01:12:08,295 --> 01:12:10,205
Pardon me.

1178
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,410
Hello, Cassie.

1179
01:12:15,774 --> 01:12:18,571
Come on, l want you
to meet Mrs. Carlsen.

1180
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:25,085
-Mrs. Carlsen, this is Cassie Hartley.
-l'm glad to know you.

1181
01:12:25,812 --> 01:12:28,406
-lf you're talking business, l'll wait.
-Oh, no.

1182
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:32,362
-Cassie and l were going to get dinner.
-Would you care to come along?

1183
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,803
No.

1184
01:12:34,972 --> 01:12:36,246
-No, thank you.
-Joe.

1185
01:12:36,412 --> 01:12:38,368
What's the matter?

1186
01:12:38,732 --> 01:12:40,848
Get some water.

1187
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:50,406
-We'll take her to a doctor.
-Take me home.

1188
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:52,640
-Don't you think it--?
-l said, take me home!

1189
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,966
Hop in, Cassie.

1190
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,327
-l'll run it in the garage for you.
-No, stop. Stop it, do you hear?

1191
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:07,086
-What's the matter with you?
-Please, let me out. Please, let me out!

1192
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:11,322
-Would you like me to come in?
-Leave me alone.

1193
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:19,004
Hi, boss.

1194
01:13:22,848 --> 01:13:25,521
Here are those federal gas papers.
They look all right.

1195
01:13:25,688 --> 01:13:27,326
Fine, George. l'll go over them.

1196
01:13:27,488 --> 01:13:29,955
Mrs. Carlsen's been here
while you were out to dinner.

1197
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:32,880
l don't know,
she may be here yet.

1198
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:35,438
Okay.

1199
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:51,519
-Hello, Joe.
-Oh, hello.

1200
01:13:52,006 --> 01:13:54,394
We may knock over
that federal gas contract.

1201
01:13:54,565 --> 01:13:55,680
That's swell.

1202
01:13:55,845 --> 01:13:58,439
-How do you feel tonight?
-Oh, much better.

1203
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:00,482
Oh, that's good.

1204
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,319
Sorry about yesterday, Joe.
l guess my nerves just gave out.

1205
01:14:04,964 --> 01:14:07,159
You ought to go away for a while,
get a change.

1206
01:14:07,364 --> 01:14:09,480
You've been hanging around
that house too much.

1207
01:14:09,644 --> 01:14:11,679
Maybe l will.

1208
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:18,119
Your friend Miss Hartley,
she's very nice.

1209
01:14:18,883 --> 01:14:21,397
-Known her long?
-Quite a while.

1210
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,472
Did you have a nice time
after you left me?

1211
01:14:24,643 --> 01:14:26,633
lt was all right.

1212
01:14:26,802 --> 01:14:28,838
You must apologize
to Miss Hartley for me.

1213
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:31,556
Oh, she didn't think anything of it.

1214
01:14:38,001 --> 01:14:40,674
-How about some dinner, Joe?
-l've had mine.

1215
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:44,436
You could sit with me and have a drink.
Maybe we could dance.

1216
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:48,230
l'd like to, but l've got to get some
estimates. Figures on the new trucks.

1217
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,868
l know, but you can do
all that tomorrow morning.

1218
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,476
l've got a lot of other things to do
in the morning, and this is important.

1219
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,154
lt's the only time l have to do it.

1220
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,350
l'm sorry, Joe.

1221
01:15:00,519 --> 01:15:04,307
l guess l'm a fine partner,
trying to pull you away from your work.

1222
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:07,311
The Frank Conners
are throwing a party Friday night.

1223
01:15:07,478 --> 01:15:10,039
They asked me to bring you along.

1224
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:12,555
Sorry, l can't make it.

1225
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,473
''Can't make it. Can't make it. ''
That's all l ever hear from you.

1226
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,948
lt used to be because my husband
was your friend. Well, he's dead.

1227
01:15:21,118 --> 01:15:24,666
He's been dead for six months.
What's wrong with me now?

1228
01:15:24,837 --> 01:15:26,748
Why can't you make it?

1229
01:15:26,917 --> 01:15:30,114
l'm getting married Friday.
ls that a good enough reason?

1230
01:15:33,756 --> 01:15:37,716
Married? To that redhead?

1231
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:39,356
To that redhead.

1232
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,667
What made you think
you had to marry her?

1233
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:46,028
l just thought it was a good idea.
Any objections?

1234
01:15:46,196 --> 01:15:50,473
Yeah, l got objections. What makes you
think you can make a sucker out of me?

1235
01:15:50,635 --> 01:15:55,390
-You better relax.
-Don't tell me to relax, you road slob.

1236
01:15:55,555 --> 01:15:58,546
lf it weren't for me, you'd still be
kicking trucks up the coast.

1237
01:15:58,714 --> 01:16:01,069
l get Ed to take you off the road.

1238
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:03,669
l put that clean collar
around your dirty neck.

1239
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:07,543
l put those creases in your pants.
l put that money in your pocket.

1240
01:16:07,714 --> 01:16:09,909
What makes you think
you can walk out on me?

1241
01:16:10,074 --> 01:16:13,782
l came in here on a business deal,
and l've done all right for you.

1242
01:16:13,953 --> 01:16:16,148
Don't talk like a fool.

1243
01:16:16,313 --> 01:16:19,350
l walked you right into a company
that was set and established.

1244
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:22,106
l gave you Ed's insurance money
to buy new trucks.

1245
01:16:22,272 --> 01:16:25,708
l could have picked anyone off the street
and they'd have done as well.

1246
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,146
Anytime you don't like the setup,
l can check out.

1247
01:16:28,312 --> 01:16:29,506
You're not getting out.

1248
01:16:29,712 --> 01:16:31,623
You belong with me,
and you're gonna stay.

1249
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:33,589
lf you don't like it, you'll learn to.

1250
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:36,351
Only you're not going off
marrying that cheap redhead.

1251
01:16:36,511 --> 01:16:39,423
l'm marrying Cassie, and l'm not asking
anybody what they think.

1252
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:41,821
That includes you.

1253
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:47,306
She hasn't any right to you.
You're mine, and l'm hanging on to you.

1254
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,984
l committed murder to get you.

1255
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,102
Understand? Murder.

1256
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:57,786
-You what?
-Sure. l killed Ed.

1257
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:00,907
l killed him to get you because
you always threw him in my face.

1258
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:03,947
''Yes, Mrs. Carlsen. No, Mrs. Carlsen.

1259
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:07,067
No, Mrs. Carlsen.
Good night, Mrs. Carlsen. ''

1260
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:09,947
You made me do it.
You, understand?

1261
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:15,865
l didn't want to kill anyone, but you
made me murder Ed, your friend.

1262
01:17:18,787 --> 01:17:21,939
Joe! Joe, where are you going?

1263
01:17:22,108 --> 01:17:24,224
l'm getting out of here,
and stay away from me.

1264
01:17:24,388 --> 01:17:27,663
Oh, Joe, don't go. Forget what l said.
l didn't mean what l said.

1265
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:29,897
l didn't know
what l was talking about.

1266
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:33,695
-l didn't kill Ed. lt was just an accident.
-Save that record for someone else.

1267
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:37,256
-You may need it.
-Oh, listen, Joe. l'll be a good sport.

1268
01:17:37,426 --> 01:17:41,384
Marry her, and l hope you're happy
with her, only please don't leave me.

1269
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:44,218
Please come back.

1270
01:17:47,105 --> 01:17:52,463
l didn't want to kill anyone. l didn't.

1271
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:07,735
l didn't want to kill anyone.

1272
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:11,976
He made me do it.

1273
01:18:13,582 --> 01:18:15,619
Yes.

1274
01:18:16,143 --> 01:18:18,782
He made me kill him.

1275
01:18:18,943 --> 01:18:21,979
He made me kill him.
He said he'd kill me if l didn't.

1276
01:18:22,142 --> 01:18:24,610
l didn't want to do it,
but l was afraid of him.

1277
01:18:24,782 --> 01:18:27,740
l had to. Joe wanted
the insurance money.

1278
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:30,290
He wanted everything for himself.
He made me do it.

1279
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:32,417
Just a moment.

1280
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:37,735
Have Joe Fabrini of Carlsen Trucking
picked up, and you come in here.

1281
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,130
ln other words,
when you were in this office. . .

1282
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:43,418
. . .the morning after your husband's
death, your statement was a lie.

1283
01:18:43,581 --> 01:18:47,016
Yes, but l didn't want to lie.
l was afraid to tell the truth then.

1284
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,489
-Now l'm not afraid anymore.
-l see.

1285
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,050
The truth is that you were coerced
into murdering your husband by Fabrini.

1286
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,938
Yes, yes, that's it.

1287
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:58,010
That's it.

1288
01:18:58,179 --> 01:19:01,649
-He made me kill him.
-Sit down.

1289
01:19:01,819 --> 01:19:05,527
l'm going to dictate for your signature
the confession you've just made to me.

1290
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:09,294
Correct me if l'm wrong.
''l, Lana Carlsen. . . . ''

1291
01:19:18,657 --> 01:19:20,534
She never thought l'd see her.

1292
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:23,131
l'll bet she was surprised
when they told her l would.

1293
01:19:23,297 --> 01:19:25,857
l'll see her, all right.
l've got things to tell her.

1294
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:31,010
-All right, tell her, not me.
-Just wait till l see her. Just wait.

1295
01:19:39,176 --> 01:19:43,088
-What's the matter with you?
-That door. . .

1296
01:19:43,255 --> 01:19:46,247
-. . .it opened.
-Of course it did. We broke the ray.

1297
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,645
lt's an electric eye door. Come on.

1298
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:52,773
No, l won't go through it.
l won't go through it, l tell you.

1299
01:19:52,974 --> 01:19:54,373
-l won't, l tell you.
-Stop it.

1300
01:19:54,534 --> 01:19:59,049
No, l won't. No, please.
Please don't make me.

1301
01:20:04,774 --> 01:20:06,924
l thought you'd show up.

1302
01:20:07,093 --> 01:20:08,924
Now that you're here,
what do you want?

1303
01:20:09,093 --> 01:20:11,482
l want you to tell the truth.

1304
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:13,166
What do you think the truth is?

1305
01:20:13,373 --> 01:20:17,001
Joe had nothing to do with killing your
husband, and nothing to do with you.

1306
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,770
ls that so?

1307
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:22,447
What do you think he was doing those
nights he was working in the garage?

1308
01:20:22,612 --> 01:20:24,761
Do you think he was
in the garage at all?

1309
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,001
Why do you think l took him
into the business?

1310
01:20:27,171 --> 01:20:30,323
Why did l give him my husband's
insurance money to play with?

1311
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,163
Because he had an honest face?

1312
01:20:32,571 --> 01:20:35,290
You could talk from now on,
but you'd never make me believe. . .

1313
01:20:35,451 --> 01:20:37,919
. . .that Joe ever laid a hand
on anyone like you.

1314
01:20:38,091 --> 01:20:42,322
-What makes you so sure of that?
-l love him. l know.

1315
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,526
You love him.

1316
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:48,398
You don't know what
it is to love a man, but l do.

1317
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:51,959
And l'll take him with me
wherever l'm going.

1318
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:54,766
You're worse than l thought
anyone could be.

1319
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:56,965
Why don't you tell them
what really happened?

1320
01:20:57,129 --> 01:20:59,040
Joe wouldn't have
anything to do with you.

1321
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:02,042
You killed your husband
because you thought he was in the way.

1322
01:21:02,209 --> 01:21:04,881
You threw yourself at Joe,
but he wouldn't look at you. . .

1323
01:21:05,048 --> 01:21:07,278
. . .because he had you pegged
from the beginning.

1324
01:21:07,448 --> 01:21:09,757
Tell them you found out
he was going to marry me. . .

1325
01:21:09,928 --> 01:21:14,796
. . .and you decided to stop it,
even if it meant double-crossing yourself.

1326
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:17,527
You've got it all worked out,
haven't you?

1327
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:21,156
But you've got it worked out
wrong, all wrong.

1328
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:23,761
Because l'm the one who--

1329
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,483
Stop that door.

1330
01:21:33,246 --> 01:21:36,476
Stop it, l tell you.
Stop that door!

1331
01:21:36,885 --> 01:21:39,683
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Come on. Come on, your time's up.

1332
01:21:39,845 --> 01:21:42,882
No, l won't go through that door!
l won't! You can't make me!

1333
01:21:43,045 --> 01:21:46,832
-Come on, come on.
-l won't! No, l won't! l won't, l tell you!

1334
01:21:47,004 --> 01:21:50,475
l won't! l won't! l won't!

1335
01:21:52,085 --> 01:21:55,838
-What's the dame hitting high C for?
-Maybe she don't like the service here.

1336
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:58,837
l don't know why these things
always got to bust at lunchtime.

1337
01:21:59,004 --> 01:22:02,154
This one's all right. Close her up.

1338
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:09,640
So, Your Honor, and ladies
and gentlemen of the jury. . .

1339
01:22:09,802 --> 01:22:13,078
. . .the prosecution will prove
that Joe Fabrini. . .

1340
01:22:13,282 --> 01:22:15,797
. . .by means of duress and threats,
employed the wife. . .

1341
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:18,430
. . .of the murdered man
as ruthlessly as ever a man. . .

1342
01:22:18,602 --> 01:22:20,797
. . .employed a dagger or gun,
to commit for profit. . .

1343
01:22:20,962 --> 01:22:24,716
. . .a cold-blooded, brutal,
preconceived murder.

1344
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:31,070
With your permission, l will call
the first witness, Miss Sue Carter.

1345
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:33,954
ls it true you attended
a party at the Carlsen home. . .

1346
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,758
. . .the night of Mr. Carlsen's death?

1347
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,114
Yes, Your Honor.

1348
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,748
The judge is the only person
in this courtroom. . .

1349
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,195
. . .to be addressed as ''Your Honor. ''

1350
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,035
-How do you do?
-Now, at this party during the evening. . .

1351
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:50,636
. . .did you see Mr. Fabrini
and Mrs. Carlsen in private conversation?

1352
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:55,711
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Miss Carter, l am asking the questions.

1353
01:22:55,879 --> 01:22:58,676
Now, where did this
conversation take place?

1354
01:22:58,838 --> 01:23:01,511
Well, l just happened to be
in the powder room. . .

1355
01:23:01,678 --> 01:23:04,750
. . .powdering my nose, of course,
and l looked out the window. . .

1356
01:23:04,918 --> 01:23:09,196
. . .and l saw Mr. Fabrini and Mrs. Carlsen
standing by the side of his car arguing.

1357
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:12,907
-Did you hear what they were saying?
-Well, l didn't exactly hear.

1358
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:16,672
You understand, l didn't try,
but it seemed to me that one of them. . .

1359
01:23:16,837 --> 01:23:18,748
. . .wanted the other one
to do something. . .

1360
01:23:18,917 --> 01:23:23,671
. . .but l couldn't tell who wanted who
to do what to which.

1361
01:23:24,156 --> 01:23:27,546
When your brother became head
of the Carlsen Trucking service. . .

1362
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:30,309
. . .did you get a job as traffic manager
with the company?

1363
01:23:30,475 --> 01:23:32,830
-Yeah, but--
-Objection. The question is leading.

1364
01:23:32,995 --> 01:23:36,147
-Objection sustained.
-That's all.

1365
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:38,545
Miss Hartley, you say
that you and Mr. Fabrini. . .

1366
01:23:38,715 --> 01:23:40,945
. . .have been in love,
plan to be married.

1367
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:43,345
-That's right.
-Can you tell me why. . .

1368
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:45,312
. . .you didn't get married
some time ago?

1369
01:23:45,475 --> 01:23:49,262
-We couldn't afford it.
-Did Fabrini work evenings quite a bit?

1370
01:23:49,434 --> 01:23:51,470
-Yes.
-Could you swear that Mr. Fabrini. . .

1371
01:23:51,634 --> 01:23:54,431
. . .was actually in his office
working on those evenings?

1372
01:23:54,593 --> 01:23:56,902
-No, but l--
-lsn't it possible that Mr. Fabrini. . .

1373
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:59,746
. . .didn't marry because
he found marriage inconvenient. . .

1374
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:02,347
-. . .in his relations with Mrs. Carlsen?
-Objection.

1375
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:03,992
Objection sustained.

1376
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:06,303
The witness will not have
to answer that.

1377
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:09,192
lsn't it true that Mr. Fabrini
kept you two ladies apart. . .

1378
01:24:09,353 --> 01:24:11,946
. . .until one evening, when he got
his dates crossed. . .

1379
01:24:12,112 --> 01:24:13,704
. . .he found you both face to face?

1380
01:24:13,872 --> 01:24:15,464
-Well, Joe never did--
-l object!

1381
01:24:15,632 --> 01:24:17,748
-Overruled.
-lsn't it true that Mrs. Carlsen. . .

1382
01:24:17,912 --> 01:24:19,742
. . .was so unnerved that she fainted?

1383
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:23,062
-She was ill.
-Certainly, she was ill. lll of shock.

1384
01:24:23,231 --> 01:24:25,142
Shocked at finding the man
for whom. . .

1385
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:27,745
. . .she murdered her own husband
with another woman.

1386
01:24:27,951 --> 01:24:30,146
That's not right.
Joe didn't help in any murder.

1387
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:32,745
He didn't have anything
to do with it. lf he thought--

1388
01:24:32,911 --> 01:24:34,423
That's all.

1389
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:37,741
Did you say anything to Mr. Fabrini
about Mrs. Carlsen?

1390
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:39,662
l don't remember.

1391
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,946
Did you ever notice that after Fabrini
came to work at Carlsen's. . .

1392
01:24:43,109 --> 01:24:47,341
. . .that Mrs. Carlsen frequented the
garage more than she had previously?

1393
01:24:48,349 --> 01:24:50,942
-l don't remember.
-Don't you remember anything?

1394
01:24:51,108 --> 01:24:55,182
-Why don't you remember?
-Maybe it's because l got a bad memory.

1395
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:01,906
Now, Your Honor and ladies
and gentlemen of the jury. . .

1396
01:25:02,068 --> 01:25:05,185
. . .l call to the stand Mrs. Lana Carlsen.

1397
01:25:23,226 --> 01:25:25,342
Stand up, please.

1398
01:25:25,506 --> 01:25:28,782
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

1399
01:25:28,946 --> 01:25:30,618
l do.

1400
01:25:30,786 --> 01:25:32,901
Take the chair.

1401
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,496
State your name.

1402
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:40,815
-Lana Carlsen.
-You will speak up, please.

1403
01:25:40,984 --> 01:25:43,862
You were, at the time of his death,
the wife of Edward Carlsen?

1404
01:25:44,024 --> 01:25:45,059
Yes.

1405
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:49,342
How long before the death of Carlsen
were you acquainted with Joe Fabrini?

1406
01:25:49,504 --> 01:25:50,732
Two years.

1407
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:53,213
Where did you first meet him?

1408
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:57,652
Mrs. Carlsen, l asked you
where you first met Fabrini.

1409
01:25:57,823 --> 01:25:59,939
You will answer
the question, please.

1410
01:26:08,382 --> 01:26:11,101
He was laughing.

1411
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:14,971
Yes, he-- He was laughing.

1412
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:19,140
He kissed me when he was drunk.

1413
01:26:19,422 --> 01:26:23,130
Yes, he kissed me
when he was drunk.

1414
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:27,298
So l got a new car.

1415
01:26:27,581 --> 01:26:30,890
Yes, l got a new car.

1416
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,770
And l bought some new clothes.

1417
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:39,049
Yes, they were pretty.

1418
01:26:39,939 --> 01:26:44,013
And he used to tell terrible jokes.

1419
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:47,168
And he'd laugh at them.

1420
01:26:47,499 --> 01:26:50,377
He was always laughing.

1421
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:55,811
And then l saw him lying there. . .

1422
01:26:56,098 --> 01:26:58,248
. . .drunk.

1423
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,975
l heard the motor running.

1424
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:07,010
And l saw the doors.

1425
01:27:07,378 --> 01:27:09,766
l heard the motor.

1426
01:27:10,177 --> 01:27:12,247
l saw the doors.

1427
01:27:13,377 --> 01:27:15,413
The doors made me do it.

1428
01:27:16,017 --> 01:27:17,608
Yes.

1429
01:27:17,776 --> 01:27:20,574
The doors made me do it.

1430
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:23,614
The doors made me do it.

1431
01:27:27,735 --> 01:27:29,612
The doors made me do it!

1432
01:27:29,815 --> 01:27:32,204
-Matron, remove the witness.
-They made me do it!

1433
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:34,770
They made me do it!

1434
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:39,844
The doors!
They made me do it!

1435
01:27:41,054 --> 01:27:44,444
The doors! The doors
made me do it!

1436
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:48,004
Your Honor! Your Honor,
l move that this case be dismissed. . .

1437
01:27:48,174 --> 01:27:52,405
. . .on the ground that the sole witness
to the alleged crime is obviously insane.

1438
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:56,452
Court is adjourned while the state's
alienist examine Mrs. Carlsen.

1439
01:27:56,613 --> 01:27:58,842
Everybody rise.

1440
01:28:07,092 --> 01:28:09,811
-City desk and hurry.
-Give me the desk.

1441
01:28:09,972 --> 01:28:12,566
Hello, Ed. Here it is.
The doctors all say she's daffy.

1442
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:15,291
Yeah, nuts. They had
to take her away in a straitjacket.

1443
01:28:15,451 --> 01:28:19,649
Yeah, that's right. Case thrown
out of court. Fabrini goes free.

1444
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:24,083
Sounds funny, l suppose, but l can't
help feeling sorry for that dame.

1445
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:26,919
Me too, in a way.

1446
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:30,969
-What about the business, Joe?
-What about it? lt's like l told you.

1447
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:32,882
l'm giving my share to the boys.

1448
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:35,645
After what's happened,
l need a change of scenery.

1449
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,879
What about us?

1450
01:28:38,049 --> 01:28:39,960
We're getting married
just like we figured.

1451
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:42,438
l'll dig up a new truck
and hit the road again.

1452
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:45,402
Why, l'll be on top in no time.
l can't miss with--

1453
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:48,640
Say, you're not gonna tell me
l'm not right, are you?

1454
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:51,601
No, Joe. Of course, l hate
to see you go back to the road. . .

1455
01:28:51,768 --> 01:28:55,044
. . .but if that's the way you want it
l'm with you around every curve.

1456
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:57,603
Well, my mind's made up.

1457
01:28:59,248 --> 01:29:03,126
Gee, l promised to phone the store.
Do you mind stopping while l call?

1458
01:29:03,287 --> 01:29:05,198
All right.

1459
01:29:07,407 --> 01:29:09,682
l'll only be a minute.

1460
01:29:11,086 --> 01:29:15,364
-Hello, lrish. This is Cassie.
-Hello, Cassie. What's on your mind?

1461
01:29:15,566 --> 01:29:18,204
Joe's on his way to tell you
he's giving up the business.

1462
01:29:18,365 --> 01:29:20,516
Have the guys shout him down,
l'll do the rest.

1463
01:29:20,806 --> 01:29:22,876
Okay, kid. Leave it to me.

1464
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:27,555
My mind's made up too.

1465
01:29:27,725 --> 01:29:29,556
So it's like l tell you, fellas.

1466
01:29:29,725 --> 01:29:31,955
l don't feel l got the right
to stay on here. . .

1467
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:34,513
. . .so l'm giving you my share,
and l'm bowing out.

1468
01:29:34,684 --> 01:29:36,640
No!

1469
01:29:37,244 --> 01:29:39,917
-Slow down, will you?
-You're on a dead-end street, Joe.

1470
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:43,280
That's right, Joe. These boys
want no part of an executive business.

1471
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:45,638
Paul here can handle things
as good as anybody.

1472
01:29:45,803 --> 01:29:48,443
Oh, no, not me.
l got too many other problems.

1473
01:29:48,604 --> 01:29:53,597
-We're gonna have a baby.
-Congratulations. Say, does Pearl know?

1474
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:58,436
-Say, that's good news, Paul.
-You can give us some good news.

1475
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:01,753
Say you're staying on
as the head guy.

1476
01:30:02,962 --> 01:30:06,477
Fellas, l'm sure glad
you feel this way, but l--

1477
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:08,837
Well, l--

1478
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:12,118
-What do you think, Cassie?
-Your mind's made up, Joe.

1479
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:13,795
But there's a lot of angles here.

1480
01:30:13,962 --> 01:30:16,111
Somebody's got to take care
of those accounts.

1481
01:30:16,281 --> 01:30:19,273
-l may get that gas contract.
-l wouldn't try to influence you. . .

1482
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:23,035
. . .any more than l would the boys, Joe,
but the way you're talking. . .

1483
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,555
. . .maybe you'd better stay.

1484
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,595
Okay, fellas, l'm sticking with you.
