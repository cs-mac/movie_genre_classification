00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:24,017
- Sunhi!
- Hi! How've you been?

12
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:28,221
Hi! It's been so long
since we met.

13
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,484
It has.

14
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,626
I came to meet
Professor Choi Dong-hyun.

15
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:39,332
- Have you seen him?
- No, I haven't.

16
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,535
He must've stepped out.
His phone's off, too.

17
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,940
Oh! He went on
a business trip abroad.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,399
- I see.
- A few days ago.

19
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,445
When's he coming back?

20
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:57,007
I'm not sure.
Probably soon.

21
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,987
Let's go. I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

22
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,388
No, thanks. I'll just go.

23
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,192
I want to ask you something.
Have some coffee, then go.

24
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,295
Ask me what?
I'd better go.

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,755
- Don't leave like that.
- I have somewhere to go.

26
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,697
Professor!

27
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,936
- What brings you here?
- Didn't you go abroad?

28
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,539
Me? Why would I?

29
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,742
Sangwoo said you went
on a trip abroad.

30
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,143
- He did?
- Yes.

31
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,340
Why would he?
He was just with me.

32
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,346
Have a seat.

33
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,490
- Anyway, it's good we met.
- I guess.

34
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,256
So, what brings you
out to school?

35
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,760
I was just passing by.

36
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,063
Have you been well?

37
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,007
They said you
went into hiding.

38
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,710
- Who?
- That's what the students say.

39
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,312
Why would I go into hiding?

40
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,680
Because you don't keep
in touch with anyone.

41
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,878
Let's see... 2 years? 1 year?

42
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,923
Has it been a year
since we met?

43
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:48,628
I did many things.
I've been diligent.

44
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,595
I see.

45
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,392
Actually, I have
a favor to ask.

46
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,931
Could you write me
a reference letter?

47
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,979
- Planning to study abroad?
- Yes, I'm looking into it.

48
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,243
- Where?
- The States.

49
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,687
It'll take at least 3 years
to study abroad.

50
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,452
- You want to go to grad school?
- Yes.

51
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,561
When you come back,
you'll be 31 or 32.

52
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,864
- You want to make films, right?
- Yes, I will eventually.

53
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,562
But now I want to stay
in school more.

54
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,372
I want to study.

55
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:39,369
Isn't it better to learn from
actually making films?

56
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,784
Though it's hard...

57
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:51,024
I think you should try
to go all the way.

58
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,427
You think you'll buy time

59
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,329
by going to school and such.

60
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:02,168
Then, you can make self excuses

61
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,271
not to go all the way.

62
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:11,377
You find it hard working

63
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,780
with others in productions.

64
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,882
So without results,

65
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,443
you're bound to get weary.

66
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:26,092
But you can't make films without
working with people, right?

67
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,296
You should keep trying
to work with others.

68
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,199
Come out and
mix with others.

69
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,262
And learn to live along
with them, though it's hard.

70
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,963
Right?

71
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,074
Well, I guess.

72
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,375
But Professor...

73
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,217
It took me long
to decide this

74
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,820
and I've taken
measures already.

75
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,085
It's too late to give up now.

76
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,219
- Really?
- Yes.

77
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,865
Okay. When do
you need it by?

78
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,968
The sooner the better.
Aren't you busy?

79
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:13,530
No, I'm not busy.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

80
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,578
- Come by tomorrow.
- Okay! I can come.

81
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,882
1 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
How about 1 o'clock?

82
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,585
Great. Thank you.

83
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:29,689
No problem.
But I can't lie.

84
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:34,093
If you don't like my reference,
you don't have to use it.

85
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,959
I'll just write what I know.

86
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,764
Okay. Thank you very much.

87
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:54,113
- Hi, Sunhi.
- Why did you lie?

88
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,316
- What?
- Professor Choi went abroad?

89
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,253
Oh, that. Did you meet him?

90
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,355
Why'd you say
he wasn't here?

91
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,357
You're so weird!

92
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,361
I was just joking.
It was for fun.

93
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,662
Why're you yelling?

94
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,465
You think that's funny?
You're weird!

95
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,968
How can you
call that a joke!

96
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,371
I just wanted to
play a joke on you.

97
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,073
I wanted you to laugh.
It's nothing!

98
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,675
How is that nothing!

99
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,178
I was just kidding. Really.

100
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:30,583
Sunhi, you're so innocent.
I shouldn't joke with you.

101
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,586
I'm not innocent! Stop joking.

102
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,788
No, you are innocent.

103
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,491
The most innocent girl
I've ever seen.

104
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,393
You really are weird.

105
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,296
Just say, you're sorry.
Don't make excuses.

106
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,255
Be honest.
Just apologize to me now!

107
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:55,164
Fine. I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,146
May I take your order?

109
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,086
- Just A bottle of beer, please.
- What would You like?

110
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,646
- Anything would be fine.
- Okay.

111
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,504
But we only serve
beer with chicken.

112
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,767
Really?

113
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:12,912
I'm so full. Can't I
just have the beer?

114
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,075
I'm sorry. You'll have
to order chicken.

115
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,079
Okay, then.

116
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,953
- Taking the subway?
- Yes.

117
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,655
I'm taking the bus.

118
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,957
- Aren't You late for the train?
- Not yet.

119
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,493
- When will You return from Busan?
- Tomorrow night.

120
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,994
Really?

121
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,797
Should I call
even if it's late?

122
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,400
Sure. Let's have
dinner together.

123
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,204
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- No, I'm the thankful one.

124
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,007
- Have A safe trip.
- Bye.

125
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,908
- Take care.
- Bye.

126
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:16,773
Bye.

127
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,781
Kim Munsu!

128
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,984
Kim Munsu!

129
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,683
Kim Munsu!

130
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,185
Look! Over here!

131
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,891
Sunhi! What are
you doing there?

132
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,298
Come here!

133
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,901
Come up!

134
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,505
Okay. Sure.

135
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,050
What are you doing?

136
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,852
I got mad over some
crazy guy, so I'm drinking.

137
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,960
It's been so long.

138
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,504
Why'd you come
by the school?

139
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,168
I was Just passing by.

140
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:29,370
- I saw your film.
- You did?

141
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,184
You shouldn't have.

142
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,381
Didn't you use our
story a bit much?

143
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,491
Is it our story?

144
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,631
- Would You like to order?
- A bottle of Soju.

145
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,190
I'll be right back.

146
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,799
What's with her?

147
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,005
She was really rude
to me before.

148
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,905
What a crazy bitch.

149
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,650
She goes to our school.

150
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,445
Are you drunk?

151
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,245
You didn't drink much.

152
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,853
Are you still in grad school?

153
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,855
Stop studying.
Why're you still there?

154
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:22,101
I have 1 semester left.
I hate it, too. It seems useless.

155
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,364
You're a director now.

156
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,471
So, why go to school?

157
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:33,070
Oh, right. With that degree,
you can become a professor.

158
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,578
Maybe.

159
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:40,575
That's a big maybe.

160
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,889
Why'd you change so much?

161
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,531
Acting so serious after
becoming a director?

162
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,335
Seeing you coming in,
you looked so haughty.

163
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,895
Stop it. It's gross.

164
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,530
No, I'm not.

165
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,239
I looked like that?

166
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,544
It's not the beer talking?

167
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,385
I've never seen a decent man
who changes with little success.

168
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,688
Be yourself.

169
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,955
Don't act so big. Relax.

170
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,496
I didn't become anything.

171
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:29,662
I made that film with
my money. I spent $10,000.

172
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,163
And hardly anyone
saw my film.

173
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,768
I know.

174
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,268
So, don't change.

175
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,415
People try to
change too much.

176
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,079
What change? When you
don't even know yourself?

177
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:57,285
So, I want to go somewhere
else after I finish school.

178
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:03,826
People in film aren't normal.
They're all crazy.

179
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,374
Stop making excuses
and focus on one thing.

180
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,876
Going to school or running away,

181
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,379
they're all excuses.

182
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,180
Keep at it all the way.

183
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,844
Then, you'll know your limits
and find out who you are.

184
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,147
Here you are.

185
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,662
Let's drink together.

186
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,172
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.

187
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,081
When I see you,
I always drink.

188
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,388
You make me want to drink.

189
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:57,887
I do?

190
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,754
I really missed you.

191
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,655
- We drank too much.
- I really missed you.

192
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,863
You're lucky to see me.

193
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,869
- You saw my film, right?
- Yes. It was okay.

194
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,275
You...

195
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,173
You're the topic of my life.

196
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:08,020
If I... make films till I die,
they'll all be about you.

197
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:14,630
All my films are
about you. You know?

198
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,930
Why am I a topic?

199
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,678
Why did we break up?

200
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,137
Tell me. Why did
we break up then?

201
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,351
- Later. I'll tell you later.
- Later? Again?

202
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,550
Why?

203
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,461
You know how hard it's been?

204
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:47,357
What are you waiting for?

205
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,264
It's hard for me, too.

206
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,167
I'll tell you later
when the time comes.

207
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,065
Sunhi.

208
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,272
Look at me.

209
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,605
I really like you.

210
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,023
Do you know that?

211
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,419
Do you?

212
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,031
Why don't you know that?

213
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,238
Why?

214
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,755
I can't explain my feelings.

215
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,461
- I'm weird, right?
- No.

216
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,064
You're so pretty.

217
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:05,300
In all my life... you're
the one I like the most.

218
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,608
Really!

219
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,911
I'd better go.

220
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,922
Don't go.

221
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,664
Sorry, I have to go.

222
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,825
Where?

223
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:33,233
I have to go somewhere.

224
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,543
Don't leave like that!

225
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:45,043
<i>Oh, the old days of playing
merrily in my hometown</i>

226
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:54,152
<i>How we whispered love
under the tranquil moonlight</i>

227
00:20:54,152 --> 00:21:03,195
Where have you gone?
Were you only a dream?

228
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:31,116
<i>In my old hometown,
only the grass has grown green</i>

229
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:44,336
<i>In</i> the beloved hometown,
you and <i>I</i> were innocent and young

230
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:53,645
<i>We held hands and promised
to never change</i>

231
00:21:53,645 --> 00:22:02,587
Where have you gone leaving
me unforgettable memories?

232
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:11,553
In the beloved hometown,
now only the moonlight shines on me

233
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,089
Jaehak!

234
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,991
Jaehak!

235
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,241
Jaehak!

236
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,586
Jaehak!

237
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,330
- What are You doing there?
- Hi!

238
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,742
I just came to see you.

239
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,739
What are you doing?

240
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,842
Just something.

241
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:17,289
I wanted to see you.
Should I come up?

242
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,657
But I was in the
middle of something.

243
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,496
- You Have to do something?
- Yes.

244
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,363
What? Will it take long?

245
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,468
I'm not sure.

246
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,005
You really came to see me?

247
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,964
Yes, I have something
to ask you.

248
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,015
Can you come out
for a second?

249
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,518
You're noisy.
There are people.

250
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,679
What?

251
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,482
Then...

252
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:58,486
Wait around. It'll take
me an hour or two.

253
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,823
- You know, 'Arirang'?
- Yes.

254
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,428
- Wait for me there?
- Okay, then.

255
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,636
I'll wait for you!

256
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,562
Annoying fool.

257
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,184
Why's he bothering me! Damn!

258
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:16,335
<i>CAFE ARIRANG</i>

259
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,243
- Here. Have some.
- Thanks.

260
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,588
What's taking him so long?

261
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,455
- His phone's turned off, too.
- I don't know.

262
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,696
Are you hungry? I know
a great chicken place.

263
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,999
- Really?
- It's very good.

264
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,303
Well, if you want,
you can order it.

265
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,504
- Should I?
- Yes.

266
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,472
- Then, I'll order.
- Sure.

267
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,160
- Hi!
- Waited long?

268
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,529
It's okay. I just wanted
to have a few drinks.

269
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,726
You drank a lot.
Something wrong?

270
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,228
Jaehak!

271
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,641
I really, really missed you!

272
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,546
You know I really
like you, right?

273
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,748
Thanks.

274
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,448
You really know?

275
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,950
Sure you're okay?

276
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,361
Things are hard these days.

277
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,259
What's so hard?

278
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:56,268
I just have a lot on
my mind these days.

279
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,110
- You came?
- Hi.

280
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,102
- What'll it be? Soju?
- Just A cup.

281
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,849
- We ordered chicken.
- Good idea.

282
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,408
- Wasn't it?
- Yes.

283
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,355
The chicken must
be really good.

284
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,121
It's very fresh.
And very crispy.

285
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,729
And it's less oily.

286
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:26,934
Are you sick these days?
You don't look well.

287
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,340
Well, sort of. But I
just don't feel right.

288
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,144
I saw Sunhi.

289
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,754
She came to me.

290
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,659
So, I drank today.

291
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,261
Oh, really?

292
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:56,601
I heard she disappeared
and couldn't be reached.

293
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,966
She came to see you?

294
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,307
She came to the school.

295
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:10,313
She's still as pretty as ever.

296
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,252
Really?

297
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:26,064
To me... she is really,
really pretty.

298
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,931
I can't help it.

299
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,236
Here you are.

300
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,230
Soju?

301
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,950
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

302
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,557
- Munsu.
- Yes?

303
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,568
Women shouldn't
be held back.

304
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,369
You think I held her back?

305
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:12,911
No, I didn't.
I just liked her.

306
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,714
Women are more
realistic than men.

307
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,876
We should respect
their judgment.

308
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,622
Men just fall for anyone.

309
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,625
And too emotional.
But women are different.

310
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:32,931
Women are far better than men.
Don't try to hold her back.

311
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,298
If she wants to go,
then let her.

312
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,102
That's good for
both of you.

313
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,005
But Sunhi came to me.

314
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:54,352
That means she is still
thinking about us.

315
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,656
So, just go with
what she decides.

316
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:03,856
Don't try so hard.
Don't ever overdo it.

317
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,257
But I should try
hard to know!

318
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,667
If I don't do anything, I won't
know what's really good!

319
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,272
I guess.

320
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:26,674
I have to dig all the way...

321
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,123
I have to dig all the
way to get there.

322
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:37,528
I have to dig all the way and go
to find out about myself.

323
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,087
- Right?
- Look.

324
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:44,398
Digging all the
way and going...

325
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:51,943
- Digging and going...
- I get it.

326
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,544
- No!
- Okay, I get it.

327
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,147
- Listen to me!
- I get it!

328
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,249
- Just listen to me!
- I get it!

329
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,886
You have to dig all
the way to know.

330
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:07,992
Then, I can go and
know what's important.

331
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,395
I'll realize what's good.

332
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:17,101
Fine. Digging all the way is good,
but you won't find what you want.

333
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:23,268
You'll just learn what you can't do.
You'll know your limits.

334
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,470
Then, you'll know
who you are.

335
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,674
Really?

336
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,520
There are a million things
you want. Right?

337
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,682
And it changes every day?

338
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,391
Anyone can imagine
what they can be.

339
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:56,299
Knowing what You can't do...
that's how you know who you are.

340
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,544
Do you really think that?

341
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,740
Of course I do...

342
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:10,044
Didn't I tell you this before?

343
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,848
I thought I did.

344
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,758
Didn't I?

345
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,663
I told you this before.

346
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,168
What are you talking about?

347
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,374
Trying to put me down?

348
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,382
No, I'm not. I'm just saying.

349
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,684
Forget it, then.
Don't stare at me.

350
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:57,335
Yes, don't stare like that.
Don't get angry.

351
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,071
He's trying to give
you advice. Right?

352
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,539
Right.

353
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,441
Be happy drinking.

354
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,949
Are you avoiding
me these days?

355
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,750
No.

356
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:29,058
Well, you never answer
my calls these days.

357
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,864
And come out late like this.

358
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,071
Before, you used to...

359
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,915
call me often.

360
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,874
But you never call me now!

361
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,678
Why?

362
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,791
I didn't?

363
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,090
You could've felt that way.

364
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,630
I'll tell you later.

365
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,536
See? Even now!

366
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:23,345
You're saying crazy things
to me, now! To me!

367
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,955
I'll think it over.
Then, I'll tell you later.

368
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:39,604
Tell me what!

369
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,163
You're making me curious.

370
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,365
It's something important.

371
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,174
I'll think it over more,
then tell you.

372
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,075
Man, I'm so curious.

373
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,879
Really...

374
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,159
What are you
thinking about me?

375
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,820
Later!

376
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,635
I'll tell you.

377
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,545
- How about some music?
- Sure.

378
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,648
I waited 3 hours.

379
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,538
Hey.

380
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:33,246
I heard this song.
Just before.

381
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,250
Okay, pal.

382
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,259
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

383
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,511
- Hello.
- Hi, Sunhi.

384
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,517
- Sit down.
- Okay.

385
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,725
- I printed 3 reference letters.
- Thank you.

386
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:22,566
See if it's okay. If you
don't like it, don't use it.

387
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,432
No, I'll use it. Thank you.

388
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,738
- You even signed it?
- Of course.

389
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:34,240
- You can read English, right?
- Yes.

390
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,748
This is wine.

391
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:46,151
You didn't have to.
I'll enjoy it.

392
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:58,961
- I'll try my best.
- That's good. Good luck.

393
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,410
One copy is mine.

394
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,973
Wui Sunhi was a film
student in my courses.

395
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:41,779
She is reserved and rarely
expresses herself.

396
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:44,181
So, she had difficulty
getting others

397
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:48,986
to cooperate in her works.

398
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,991
She seems ambitious, but
lacks courage to take action.

399
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:58,095
She is smart and has
a great grasp on films.

400
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,597
She has artistic sense.

401
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,300
With chance,
she'll get stronger

402
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,104
and may show
her hidden talents.

403
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:11,909
I suspect she has some talent,
but I couldn't verify it.

404
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:18,115
I hope her experience at your
school will be that chance.

405
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:23,120
She tries to be honest and
has an ideally innocent side.

406
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,088
Thank you for reading this.

407
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,601
Hello?

408
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,805
It's Sunhi.
Are you okay to talk?

409
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,414
Sure. It's fine.

410
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,510
I read your reference letter.

411
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,410
Is it okay to write it like this?

412
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:01,655
Why? What's wrong?
You don't like it?

413
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:11,358
It says things like
I'm reserved. Is that okay?

414
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:17,908
That's better, silly. It seems
more honest and good.

415
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,111
They regard it more
highly like that abroad.

416
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,375
I've written many references.

417
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:29,720
But it makes me seem
like a weak person.

418
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,624
It doesn't say
what I want to do.

419
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,286
I wrote what I
felt about you.

420
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,694
What do you
want me to do?

421
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:47,838
Can you spare me a moment?
Can we discuss this in person?

422
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,704
I'd like to ask you
something, too.

423
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,707
Really?

424
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,610
Fine, then.
Come to my room.

425
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,888
I'd like to treat
you to lunch.

426
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:07,051
How about your
favorite place? 'The Sun'?

427
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:13,497
Okay, I'll be right there.

428
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,261
Thank you.

429
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,873
<i>KOREAN CUISINE</i>

430
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:35,585
Professor.

431
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,523
Am I really that reserved?

432
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:45,329
Yes, You are. But sometimes you
seem odd, and sometimes brave.

433
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:49,633
- I'm brave?
- Yes, because You are honest.

434
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,936
Then, why'd you say
I can't express myself?

435
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,098
What? Did I?

436
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,310
I told you I wrote
it in 30 minutes.

437
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:04,882
You said, I lack courage,
but now you say I'm brave!

438
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,852
You remember
everything I wrote?

439
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:16,049
And... I seem too ambitious?

440
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,560
You have hidden ambitions.

441
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,198
Doesn't everybody?

442
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,862
That's true, but
aren't you different?

443
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:30,363
I'm not different!
I'm just the same.

444
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,613
Right. But I said
some good things.

445
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,774
I guess.

446
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,680
You said, I was good.

447
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,585
I have artistic sense.

448
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,522
And I'm idealistic.

449
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:49,584
You do have artistic
sense and you're good.

450
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,488
I'm not good.

451
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,398
Really?

452
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:02,272
You want me to give
it more thought, right?

453
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,676
Yes. Just 30 minutes
more, please?

454
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,278
Fine. I'll think 1 more hour.

455
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:14,547
But will that bring
out anything else?

456
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,049
I don't know.

457
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,951
Right. You don't.

458
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,960
You used to like me.

459
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,558
So, I came to you.
But why're you so cold?

460
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:37,566
Right. You're my
favorite student.

461
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,674
- That's right.
- But you were cold.

462
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,879
Though I liked you,
you never called me.

463
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,581
You never call, do you?

464
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:57,828
Remember when
you held my hand?

465
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:58,886
No.

466
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:05,734
In the winter, we met
outside the library.

467
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,275
You pretended to give me a High 5,
then grabbed my hand.

468
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,538
You don't remember?

469
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,740
You squeezed it
hard like this.

470
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:25,755
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, right. I did.

471
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,353
Because I liked you.

472
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,865
Did you do that
to the other girls?

473
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,563
No. Just you.

474
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:41,562
Why?

475
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,477
Because I wanted
to be with you.

476
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,177
Really?

477
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:05,726
Because I wanted to be
on your side forever.

478
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,028
What a comment.

479
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,033
Want me to be on
your side for life?

480
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,439
Should I?

481
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:25,648
Yes.

482
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,351
I'd like that.

483
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,749
Thanks.

484
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:40,259
I'm the thankful one.
Have a drink.

485
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,950
When do you need
the reference letter?

486
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,612
The sooner the better.

487
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,517
Thank you.

488
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,808
Jaehak!

489
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,214
Jaehak!

490
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,460
What are you doing here?

491
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,124
Just passing by.
Are you busy?

492
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:21,765
Not really.

493
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:26,270
Really? Then,
should I come up?

494
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,635
No.

495
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:35,479
Wait for me at Cafe Gondry
down the street?

496
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:39,383
- Cafe Gondry?
- Yes.

497
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,545
Okay, then.

498
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,345
Why didn't you
call beforehand?

499
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:14,651
Aren't you moving back in?
How long will you live there?

500
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:20,157
I don't know. They raised the rent,
so I might move to West Village.

501
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,059
- West Village?
- Yes.

502
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,062
That place was really nice.

503
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,965
Isn't the sunrise
beautiful from up there?

504
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:33,028
Yes, but they want $200 more
from when you lived there.

505
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:41,233
Why aren't you going home?
Doesn't your wife say anything?

506
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:48,585
I feel bad, but...
I went there last month.

507
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,950
You did?

508
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,896
I'm sorry to keep asking.
But why'd you leave home?

509
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:03,100
Let's not talk about that.

510
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:08,205
I'm curious. Why'd you leave
your lovely wife to live out alone?

511
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:13,666
Let's just drop it. That's
my business to handle.

512
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,472
Your wife is amazing.

513
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,984
I feel sorry...

514
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,485
But I can't help it.

515
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,485
Still, sometimes I envy you.

516
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,996
You?

517
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,035
- Why would You envy me?
- You live so freely.

518
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,902
I like how you live true
to your feelings.

519
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,843
It's weird to hear you
say that to me.

520
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,312
I'd love to live like you.

521
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:53,450
Really? You think that?

522
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,753
Of course! I'm a man, too.

523
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,915
I'd love to live freely.

524
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,893
I see.

525
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,095
There's a famous quote...

526
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:10,500
'Sooner strangle
an infant in its cradle

527
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,366
than nurse unacted love'.

528
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:21,977
I think it's great how you
live true to your emotions.

529
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,181
You're great.

530
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,883
What's with you today?

531
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,989
I've never heard you
say things like that.

532
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,898
Hey.

533
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:45,192
Did something happen?

534
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,604
Yes.

535
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:59,207
I met up with a girl again.
I can't take my mind off her.

536
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,444
Really? Who?

537
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,547
WOW!

538
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,659
This is really amusing.

539
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,958
I don't want to say who it is.

540
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,165
Who is she?

541
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,706
Ordinary and a bit young.

542
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,809
- How young?
- She's Just A lot younger.

543
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:30,013
This is so shocking!

544
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,917
I can't believe I'm
hearing this from you!

545
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,020
You like seeing me like this?

546
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:43,187
It's amusing! It's great.
If you like her, it's great.

547
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,689
I'm not dating her yet.

548
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:53,195
She's just a young
woman I cherish.

549
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:57,102
- Something like that.
- Really?

550
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:05,682
Even now, she makes
my heart throb.

551
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:10,487
As I thought of her this morning,
my heart started pounding.

552
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,253
But I loved that feeling.

553
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:23,057
I almost forgot how that felt.
It's been so long.

554
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,703
It's a good thing.

555
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,367
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

556
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,775
Tell me more about her.

557
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:41,818
She's good. She's reserved,
has artistic sense, and is smart.

558
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:46,380
Sometimes she seems odd.
But she's great.

559
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,187
Great.

560
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,133
- You like someone like that?
- Yes.

561
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,436
I've met a lot of people.

562
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,973
I'm sick of girls who act
innocent and quiet.

563
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,341
But she's brave.

564
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,046
Do you want to get a beer?

565
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,344
I do, but I have to meet
some professors.

566
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,290
I'd love to drink.
Let's have some next time.

567
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,351
Okay. But I need
a beer now.

568
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,558
Hello?

569
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,871
Hello?

570
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,578
Director!

571
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:57,983
- Sir!
- Sunhi!

572
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,431
What are you doing there?

573
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,079
- Hello.
- It's been A long time.

574
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,181
Yes, it has.

575
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:22,686
I stopped for some
good coffee here.

576
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,287
But here you are.

577
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,655
- Well, I live Here.
- Right.

578
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:32,157
- You've lost weight.
- No, I'm the same.

579
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:37,264
- You look skinnier.
- I'm the same, too.

580
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,203
- Drinking coffee?
- Yes.

581
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,864
I'll order one, too.

582
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,910
Did you eat?

583
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:51,514
Yes, I ate. Will You
buy me drinks?

584
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:58,421
Really? Then, let's go now.
We don't need coffee.

585
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,911
Okay.

586
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,820
You lost so much weight.

587
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,328
- Did You pay for the coffee?
- Yes.

588
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:20,877
<i>CAFE ARIRANG</i>

589
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,436
Cheers.

590
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,595
Do you like chicken?
I know a good chicken place.

591
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:41,698
- Want to try it?
- Sure. Thank you.

592
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:47,262
Sunhi, you're so pretty.
You have a beautiful face.

593
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,409
You look great, too.

594
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,173
- Really?
- Yes.

595
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,873
- I'll order the chicken.
- Okay.

596
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:06,156
- We're ordering chicken.
- Great! Order it.

597
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,716
- Then, I'll go order.
- Order it.

598
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,165
She loves anything
with chicken in it.

599
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,066
Really?

600
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:21,435
When I met Munsu here
before, we had chicken, too.

601
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:27,877
- You met Munsu?
- Yes, he said he met you.

602
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:32,337
Really? We met by chance.

603
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:37,787
Really? He said
you came to him.

604
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:44,853
Crazy fool. That's nonsense.
We met by chance.

605
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,857
Okay, then.

606
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:54,804
Anyway, it looks like he
is still in love with you.

607
00:57:54,804 --> 00:58:00,299
He said his feelings for you
didn't change at all.

608
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,705
Well, so what?

609
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:13,617
He's a good guy.
He's manly. And nice.

610
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,122
I'm not going to
date men anymore.

611
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,126
- Really?
- Yes.

612
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:31,138
I just want to study.
Or else...

613
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:40,183
I'll give up everything and
just move to the country.

614
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,685
- To your mother?
- Yes.

615
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,347
Then, what?

616
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,559
I just want to be alone.

617
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,357
Should I try farming?

618
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,159
You? Farming?

619
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,005
That's funny.

620
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,416
You can't farm.

621
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:18,813
Then, what?
What should I do?

622
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:25,717
Look. I think
they're all excuses.

623
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:31,832
Studying? That's
all an excuse.

624
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,772
- Really?
- Yes.

625
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:39,576
- An excuse?
- That's what I think.

626
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:45,538
Just do what you like doing.

627
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:51,650
You want to make
films, right?

628
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,360
So, you wrote
scripts and such.

629
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,798
Then, just keep doing
what you like to do.

630
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,700
Dig deep while you can.

631
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,903
Before you get older.
When you have strength.

632
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,271
Keep at it all the way.
To the end.

633
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:14,573
Dig all the way
to see your limits.

634
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:20,216
Then, it's comforting.

635
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,880
And you'll find out who
you are. That's the best.

636
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,689
I've heard that before.

637
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,791
You have?

638
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:38,591
Yes, I have. But I have no
luck when I really need it.

639
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,139
You really know
what I'm saying?

640
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,198
I know.

641
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:50,246
I used to take in
every word you said.

642
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:55,514
Now, it goes in one ear
and out the other.

643
01:00:58,354 --> 01:01:02,257
It's no use at all.

644
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,062
People need luck.

645
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,501
- Luck is the best.
- Right.

646
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,969
But you're wrong.

647
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,665
Don't say things like that.

648
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,571
Why' re you so cold to me?

649
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,880
Because I met Munsu?

650
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,989
Why would I be?

651
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,288
You like me seeing Munsu?

652
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,298
No.

653
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,398
I'd rather you don't
meet him. But...

654
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,946
I have no right to
say that. Right?

655
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:09,048
I don't have to date men.

656
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,760
I don't need them.

657
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,100
The only thing
that's important...

658
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,469
What's really important
is knowing who I am.

659
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,492
You're good.

660
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,997
You're a little reserved.

661
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,192
But you're smart.

662
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,197
You have great artistic sense.

663
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,740
You're a little odd.

664
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:09,250
But that also means
you're brave. Right?

665
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,450
I'm brave?

666
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:15,157
Yes.

667
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:23,460
And you're the prettiest
girl I've ever met.

668
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,459
Really?

669
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,163
Yes.

670
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,068
Believe me.

671
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,175
I want to believe.

672
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,185
You're lovely.

673
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,889
It's good to see you again.

674
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,692
Me, too.

675
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,331
You scare me.
Sometimes you really do.

676
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:19,945
Though it gets hard...

677
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:30,855
just don't do anything
to stand in shame.

678
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,970
You're so lovely.

679
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,276
Sometimes you're very lovely.

680
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,791
Lovely.

681
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,290
I feel the same.

682
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,861
So lovely.

683
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:48,711
<i>Oh, the old days of playing
merrily in my hometown</i>

684
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:57,820
<i>How we whispered love
under the tranquil moonlight</i>

685
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:06,862
Where have you gone?
Were you only a dream?

686
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:15,737
<i>In my old hometown,
only the grass has grown green</i>

687
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,863
Chicken delivery.

688
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,272
Hello. Here you are.

689
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,852
- Thank you. Bye.
- Enjoy.

690
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,219
Thanks. The chicken is here!

691
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,738
Have some.
It looks so good.

692
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,936
It looks delicious!

693
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,300
You want to do it?

694
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,210
Yes.

695
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,858
I'm not really drunk.

696
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:53,062
Go in.

697
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,356
You sure?

698
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,240
I'll see you go, then leave.

699
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:08,905
- No, I'll see you off.
- No.

700
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,404
You go in.

701
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:19,119
Then, take this with you.

702
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:26,426
I'm going in.

703
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,933
We still have lots of time.

704
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,336
Right.

705
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:37,093
<i>CHANGGYEONG PALACE</i>

706
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:41,136
Wui Sunhi's works
in my workshops...

707
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:46,442
were strong, experimental pieces
far from existing narratives.

708
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:51,247
They were beautiful pieces
that overcame...

709
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,950
The typical trap of

710
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,353
self-absorbed expressions.

711
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:01,190
Free from the constraints
of certainty...

712
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:06,295
there were poetic messages
effectively expressed within.

713
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:11,200
Seeing her amazing achievements
at a young age...

714
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,605
she made me realize the joy
of teaching as her professor.

715
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,908
She has a calm personality
and a meticulous mind.

716
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:24,313
She is persistent yet not
fallen to self-assertion.

717
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:28,217
Although a quiet way
of communicating...

718
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:33,422
I've witnessed her success
in sharing opinions.

719
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:37,726
She has innocence and
honesty of the ideal person.

720
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:42,731
It's hard to imagine
a person of

721
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:47,636
such integrity and
talents will fail.

722
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,039
I hope the school's
excellent programs

723
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,304
will have great effects on her.

724
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,744
- Hi.
- Busy?

725
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,451
I'm just at a palace.

726
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:09,751
- Which one?
- No need to know.

727
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:16,061
- Are you with someone?
- Yes, someone.

728
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,867
Are you at Changgyeong Palace?

729
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,705
How did you know?

730
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:26,369
Well, I just thought
you'd go there.

731
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,369
Really? Why?

732
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,380
You don't like crowded places.

733
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,481
You're good.

734
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,079
Can we meet?

735
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,823
Sorry, I'm busy.

736
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:43,087
There's something
I have to tell you.

737
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:45,385
Tell me now.

738
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:48,492
Let's have drinks.
I'll tell you then.

739
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,590
I already drank too much.

740
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,699
Really?

741
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:59,206
- It's because of you.
- Me? Why?

742
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,342
Anyway, I'm not
drinking anymore.

743
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,546
Let's just meet up.

744
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:10,445
I'll call you in the
evening if I can.

745
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,552
Let's come to our senses.

746
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:19,152
- Will you help me?
- Of course.

747
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,956
Let's really do it.

748
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,963
I just need to see you.
I don't need anything else.

749
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:32,564
- Okay. I'd better go.
- Sunhi! I really want to see you.

750
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,470
- Okay. I'm hanging up.
- Call me.

751
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:59,968
- Jaehak?
- How've you been?

752
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,734
Good. Why did you call?

753
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,832
What are you doing?

754
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,742
Enjoying a taste of autumn.

755
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,284
- Really? Where are you?
- Changgyeong Palace.

756
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,050
Really? What brings you
to a place like that?

757
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,853
I wanted to feel autumn's breeze
before the seasons change.

758
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:29,598
- Is it nice there?
- Yes. it's quiet and nice.

759
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,066
Really?

760
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,862
Should I go, too?

761
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:41,368
Ah, no. I'm with
someone right now.

762
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,970
Really? Who?

763
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:48,674
I'd rather not say.

764
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:53,184
You really are with someone?

765
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,284
- Is it the girl?
- What?

766
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,362
No need to know.

767
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:04,466
You're really up to
trouble, aren't you?

768
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:08,070
I'm not up to any trouble.
What are You up to?

769
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:14,737
Nothing. We promised to have
drinks. I feel like drinking today.

770
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:21,647
Really? So early in the day?
Did something bad happen?

771
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:27,489
Just a little down today.
Let's have drinks.

772
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:32,757
I'm sorry. I can't
today. I'm sorry.

773
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:38,000
You really are up to
trouble! Lucky you!

774
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,463
- I'm not up to trouble.
- Must be nice.

775
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:50,512
Okay, then. Have fun.
I'd better go drink.

776
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:56,679
Have a drink. I'll call
you later if I can.

777
01:15:57,419 --> 01:16:01,515
- Okay. Call me.
- Okay.

778
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,873
- I feel like drinking.
- Really?

779
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,575
How about a drink?

780
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:23,679
- I need to pass.
- Really? Not feeling well?

781
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,047
- I overdrank.
- Okay, then.

782
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:32,788
I read the reference letter.
You wrote about me so well.

783
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:36,992
You complimented me so
much, I'm embarrassed.

784
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,154
Don't use it if you
don't want to.

785
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:42,197
I'm sorry you wrote it twice.

786
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,801
No need. I wrote
that in 30 minutes.

787
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:49,669
I could express you
better by rewriting it.

788
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:53,208
I rushed the first one.

789
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:58,413
So, is this similar
to who I really am?

790
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,849
This is the real you.

791
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:04,453
The more you think,
the more you see.

792
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,012
Right.

793
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,117
I wish I can be
like this forever.

794
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,621
Like what you wrote here.

795
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:15,826
This is you.

796
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,024
Okay.

797
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:24,373
I'll believe you, take
courage, and study hard.

798
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,341
Good. Do your best.

799
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:31,480
If I get to go abroad,
I'm going to dig deep.

800
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,083
Great. Dig deep till
you see the end.

801
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,485
I will.

802
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:40,389
If I dig deeper,
I'll find out who I am.

803
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:44,849
Then, I'll feel better no
matter what I find out.

804
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:50,456
Good. I told you
before to dig deep.

805
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,401
Did you?

806
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:55,962
Of course, I did.
I said to dig deep.

807
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:04,746
- Well, maybe you did.
- Silly. I said that to you.

808
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,510
Right. You did.

809
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:14,156
I know you'll do well.
I believe it.

810
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,217
- I want to believe it.
- Good.

811
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,639
Wow! Do it again.

812
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,946
It bounced back.

813
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,148
Let me try.

814
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:58,700
- This isn't easy.
- Let me try again.

815
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,190
No, I'll try again.

816
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,303
You try. How can
you throw so well?

817
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,412
One more time.

818
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:42,878
- I need to use the restroom.
- Really? It's over there.

819
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,437
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

820
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:01,960
Hi.

821
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,168
What?

822
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,905
Why'd you come here?

823
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:14,309
I came because
you said it's nice.

824
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,812
I haven't been
here in a while.

825
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:20,215
Why didn't you call
before you come?

826
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:22,183
Are you alone? Why?

827
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:29,024
You silly fool. You should've
called me before.

828
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:34,930
I came for sightseeing. I'll go.

829
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:40,096
- What are You so scared of?
- Why would I be scared?

830
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,737
Jaehak!

831
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:44,539
- Professor?
- Hi.

832
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,442
- Hi, Munsu.
- What brings You here?

833
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:50,645
What are you
two doing here?

834
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,848
Why'd you come here?

835
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,818
I just came to see Sunhi.

836
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:00,750
- Sunhi?
- Yes. Sunhi said she's here.

837
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,656
Sunhi's here? Really?

838
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:10,461
- You came to see Sunhi?
- Yes. Did you see her by chance?

839
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:12,958
We didn't see her.

840
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:19,007
What are you doing
here, Professor?

841
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:24,571
- You came for the autumn leaves?
- Yes. it seems so.

842
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:29,072
It's really nice here. I haven't
been here in a while.

843
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,278
- It's nice.
- Yes, it's really nice.

844
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,824
I'm going to the bathroom.
You two stay here.

845
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,627
- I need to go, too.
- I was going to go, too.

846
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,186
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

847
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,196
- Professor? Let's go.
- Sure.

848
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,525
Jaehak and Munsu came.

849
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,586
You go ahead first.
I'll call you later.

850
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,145
- Let's go This way.
- Okay.

851
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:40,975
I don't see Sunhi around.

852
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:46,977
- Have you dated Sunhi long?
- Yes.

853
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:51,285
But she's making
things hard.

854
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,686
Why?

855
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:59,397
She is kind of reserved,
so she doesn't open up.

856
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:04,527
We've been together long, but
I don't know how she feels.

857
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:08,977
- I see.
- Yes.

858
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:11,446
Why date her
when it's so hard?

859
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,450
But she's also really smart.

860
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,686
I know. She is smart.

861
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,348
She's smart and
has artistic sense.

862
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:27,351
- You know, too?
- I know her. She's my junior.

863
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:34,167
Right. She's cute
and a little odd.

864
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,170
She's honest
and really brave.

865
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:41,777
Right. I think so, too.

866
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,975
I guess people see
things the same.

867
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,483
Right.

868
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,084
But I don't know
what she is thinking.

869
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,288
Really?

870
01:24:58,126 --> 01:24:59,924
Where'd she go?

871
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,363
Try calling her.

872
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,128
I just did, but
her phone is off.

873
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,170
I hope she won't hide again.

874
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,973
- She Just got back.
- Really?

875
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:15,432
She tends to disappear.

876
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:19,681
Sometimes she can't
be reached for years.

877
01:25:19,681 --> 01:25:23,345
- She can't do it again.
- I see.

878
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,788
People live the
way they please.

879
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:31,493
Right. There's nothing
much others can do.

880
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:32,654
Right.
