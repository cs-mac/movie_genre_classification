1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,590
JULIUS CAESAR

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,070
Citizens of Rome Gather round.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,230
Welcome to Gordias. Now Gordias
was famous for his knot.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,077
The oracles predicted that who
could untie the knot...

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,393
would conquer the whole world.´

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,439
Many came from far and wide but
none succeeded,

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,235
until one day the mighty Alexander
arrived

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,958
Alexander, Decended from the mighty
God Apollo.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,951
Advance !

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,154
Apollo enlightened Alexander

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,149
and showed
him how to untie the knot.

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,599
Sylla has returned to Rome to
establish order.

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,878
He declares that the innocents
have no reason to fear.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,029
But that those guilty of crimes against
him shall be most severly punished.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,435
The men whose names are written on
these lists are declared outlaws.

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,433
They have no rights as citizens

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,711
enseforth they may be killed on sight

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,631
Anyone who takes it upon himself to
kill any of these men...

19
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,270
will be considered a friend of the state..

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,112
and shall be rewarded with the properties
and posessions these outlaws leave behind.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,234
The biggest crime under Roman law.

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,512
Mother?
- Cornelia?

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,632
Mother?

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,956
Where is my wife?
- at her fathers.

25
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,233
Grandmother The soldiers are comming
- Julia stay with her.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,230
Sulla has taken the city with his army

27
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,034
He has made lists hundreds of people are on them

28
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,039
Are you?
- No my wife's father is.

29
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,476
Julia stay in the house.

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,713
Don't go.
- Father where are you going?

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,190
To get your mother.

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,112
Is he not on the list?

33
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,988
He's the one you want overthere.
- Right.

34
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,548
Have you heard?
- Yes we have to hurry.

35
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,832
What's the point running away
might as well die right here.

36
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,829
Please go.
- - She's right Cinna We must leave now.

37
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,359
Cinna hurry.

38
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,590
Go.
- Please, father.

39
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,559
Go Hurry!

40
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,990
Go.!

41
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,230
Please Cornelia, run !

42
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,471
He has helped Cinna to escape

43
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,589
Give me your name.

44
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,638
It's Caesar, from the house of Julia.

45
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,832
Arrest him.

46
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,236
No please no !

47
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,875
Are you Julius Caesar?
-Yes.

48
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,435
This way....

49
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,755
This way.

50
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,515
That is not negotiable.

51
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,839
Who is he ?

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,598
Julius Caesar.

53
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,472
Nephew to Marius...

54
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,678
You have unfortunate ancestery.

55
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,470
If you think it's unfortunate
to be descendent from the Gods.

56
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,311
Which God is that?
- The Julia descendent from Aeneas,

57
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,479
Who was...
- The son of Vénus, yes yes.

58
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,194
I recall Marius making such claims.

59
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,592
There are many people these days who
claim to be descendents from the Gods.

60
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,270
We have a crest which proves it..

61
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,798
I believe you can have them
fashioned in the market place...

62
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,590
...for a couple of dinars.

63
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,155
Why did you ask to see me ?

64
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,830
Your mother...
She came to see me.

65
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,830
Did she ask you to spare my life ?
And what you agreed ?

66
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,389
Well I promised that I would consider it.

67
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,559
And I'm supposed to be grateful to you ?
- No.

68
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,959
To you we are old friends.
- You killed a lot of old friends...

69
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,310
True, true true.

70
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,871
Old friends of the day become
fresh enemies at night.

71
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,033
What do you want in
exchange for my life ?

72
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,593
Why do you think I want anything in Exchange ?

73
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,270
And like you don't give things
away for free.

74
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,792
I'm not a man without compassion.
I will help you if I can.

75
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,637
First you must understand the
gravity of the crime.

76
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,549
Cinna was my greatest enemy.
And you helped him to escape.

77
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,189
Did he?

78
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,788
Of course not.

79
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,400
He escaped my soldiers only to be
killed by one of his servants.

80
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,715
My wife ?
- She's well.

81
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,756
I leave women to their health.

82
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,238
And since you are only the son of
Cinna by marriage,

83
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,476
I intend to leave you to yours.

84
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,995
If... ?

85
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,357
If you divorce your wife.

86
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,439
Well ?

87
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,796
No I refuse.
- You refuse to devorce your wife

88
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,798
Even though it may cost you your life ?

89
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,230
My wife is my teacher.

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,392
She's more clever than I am She's
more honest than I am,

91
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,831
She's a more compelling argument
than I am or you are.

92
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,912
Or your office is.

93
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,311
I won't devorce her.

94
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,837
That Is my answer.
- Ah, Pompée...

95
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,314
What can we do with men such as this ?

96
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,195
I don't know wether to embrace
him or strangle him.

97
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,154
I think we should let hin go.
- What ?

98
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,119
His uncle Marius
was my greatest enemy.

99
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,915
He got ten Marius inside him.
Look at his eyes.

100
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,999
You want to let him go ?

101
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,558
It's the ones who smile and flatter
you should worry about.

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,990
He speaks plainly.

103
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,316
You speak plainly don't you ?

104
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,318
Always.

105
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,238
Tell me...

106
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,712
Would you kill me if you could ?

107
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,273
In an instant.

108
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,999
You can go.

109
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,673
I said you are free to go.

110
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,277
What a big heart that boy has.

111
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,708
Bring it to me in the morning.

112
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,757
Was this Sylla's plan to slaughter me outside
so I wouldnt foul the carpet with my blood ?

113
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,508
I came to warn you.
- Why?

114
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,514
Because if you don't leave Rome
I'll have to do as he asks.

115
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,830
And ?

116
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,196
And I don't want to see men like
you die young..

117
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,671
What do you know about me ?
- You refuse  Sylla.

118
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,515
I'll tell you more some day
when there is time.

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,836
But now you must leave Rome.

120
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,232
Your family will be safe,
here take this.

121
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,231
Go east to Bythinie. Show this ring to
Nicomède, it will keep you safe in his service.

122
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,430
How do I know I can trust you ?
- You don't.

123
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,755
I'll not hand my fate over to that man.

124
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,632
So you'd let him kill you ?

125
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,235
He can try if he wants,
I'm not leaving Rome.

126
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,192
Why must you be so stubborn !

127
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,318
Pompée himself offers you help.
Why don't you accept it?

128
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,319
He's Sylla's man,
it could be a trick.

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,350
Don't you trust anybody at all ?
- yes.

130
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,632
I trust you.
- Then listen to me.

131
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,870
You're not the heaven and earth.
You're just a man.

132
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,233
And some things are bigger
than you are.

133
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,510
When you were in jail...

134
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,156
...I thought you were dead.

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,600
I started to grieve your death.

136
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,959
I'm asking you to spare me that, Caésar.

137
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,953
How can I live with myself if I knew
I had one chance to save your life.

138
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,673
And I failed

139
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,750
Is this pig for sale ?
- How much will you give me for it ?

140
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,958
Ten dinars.
- That's good money for a swine.

141
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,237
He requires carving.

142
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,593
Jules César.

143
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,518
We will feed it to my dogs.

144
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,070
That's the coast of Crête.

145
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,831
The ruler there used to make up laws

146
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
and hang them so high
that people couldn't read them.

147
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,110
And if they broke the law he'd
show then no mercy.

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,154
Today the shores are infected
by pirates pirates.

149
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,071
We need to anchore for the night.

150
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,792
Where has father gone ?

151
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,957
The other side of the water.

152
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,113
How long does it take to cross the water ?

153
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,238
It depends on the wind.

154
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,276
Sometimes you can cross it in days.

155
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,679
Sometimes if the air is still
you may not move at all.

156
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,512
Easy on the ropes,
we could use nails.

157
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,037
Its the Roman way isn't it ?

158
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,398
What kind of ransom do you get
for a Roman these days?

159
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,918
Two talents.

160
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,998
But I'll pay three to watch a roman drowned.

161
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
You'd get fifty from me alive.

162
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,715
And who would collect it ?

163
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,037
They would.

164
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,474
If your men...

165
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,793
...don't return before dawn,

166
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,998
you die.

167
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,231
Your time is up, Roman.

168
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,430
I'll fight one of you for another day.

169
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,233
That's another day.

170
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,992
Nobody is comming back for this Roman.

171
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,312
Throw him in the sea.

172
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,958
Ship !

173
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,352
Fifty talents.

174
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,673
And the money just happened to
find it's way into your purse ?

175
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,757
Sir I never stole a coin from you.

176
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,350
And I suppose it was the goldsmiths
who just happened to rob me again.

177
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,234
Sir they've been convicted for it.
_I know how these things work.

178
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,078
You share the profits with
these men.

179
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,319
You pay me well I would never risk
my life for a gold coin.

180
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,160
This is the magistrate's testiment
the goldsmiths have confessed.

181
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,112
Flavius had nothing to do with it.

182
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,670
Are you trying to tell me that a
man who handles so much gold.

183
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,474
never put a piece into his pocket ?

184
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,070
He's been proven innocent.
This needs your signature.

185
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,580
Strangle him.
- Wait !

186
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,589
He's been proven innocent.

187
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,549
Well I,
just disaprove of the verdict.

188
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,759
Sylla...

189
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,673
He's a good man,
and he's here on my introduction.

190
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,594
Allow me to vouch for him
and protect him.

191
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,599
You can vouch for him all you like.

192
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,474
But protect him you can't.

193
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,911
the penalty protests strangulation.

194
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,749
Strangle him.
- There seems to be an error of jugement.

195
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,078
My jugement ?

196
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,793
Pompée...

197
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,638
You're becomming very critical.

198
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,999
You want to rise above me.
Just waiting for your chance.

199
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,149
Those men worship the rising sun
and not the setting sun.

200
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,553
That's how the saying goes isn't it ?

201
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
But I am not the setting sun not
yet but in the meantime...

202
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,359
...I expect you to subordinate yourself
to my wishes wether you understand them...

203
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,989
...or not.

204
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,831
Strangle him !

205
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,468
No...

206
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,798
You...

207
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,392
You strangle him.

208
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,515
No.

209
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,430
Taije did you hear him say no ?

210
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,668
Ah, my dear general.

211
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,193
I asked you to strangle Flavius
and strangle Flavius you will.

212
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,597
And you will do it with your own bare hands.

213
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,077
You will strangle Flavius
or you yourself will be strangled.

214
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,635
Strangle him !

215
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,871
Strangle him now !

216
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,108
I will not have my orders disobeyed !

217
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,794
I swear to...

218
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,592
Father...

219
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,995
Who are your friends ?

220
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,790
Portia and Marcus.
Don't you remember them ?

221
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,311
Of course Cato's children.
Just don't grow them so much.

222
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,477
Thats our cousin.

223
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,073
Brutus...

224
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,431
What you reading ?
- ´Ethics.

225
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,399
Aristotle ?
- My uncle Cato gave it to me.

226
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,035
How is he ?
- He's as grumpy as ever.

227
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,715
Hasn't chamged a bit.
- Mother.

228
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,919
Caesar !

229
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,959
Don't get up.
- I'm not ill.

230
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,032
Let me get dressed.

231
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,274
I'm well,
I just got up too fast.

232
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,198
You don't have to get dressed.
Lets lie down together.

233
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,198
No wait.

234
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,474
Just...

235
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,908
Cornelia...

236
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,754
I never stopped waiting for you.

237
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,233
I never stopped missing you.

238
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,234
and now...

239
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,319
Here...

240
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,192
This is not supposed to happen.

241
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,474
I'm back now,  my love.

242
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,629
Two years is just too long.

243
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,237
There are those of you who work with Sylla.

244
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,552
and those of you who worked...

245
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,871
...against him.

246
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,430
But not all that worked with
him agreed with his laws.

247
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,316
I therefor propose that the rights
of the tribunes be restored

248
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,434
So that once again the people
can be fairly represented.

249
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,988
I propose a thorough reform of the courts.

250
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,154
And an unqualified reenstatement
of the senate

251
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,152
As the principal body of gevernment.

252
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,434
Caesar !

253
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,152
Its good to se you fresh
from another victory.

254
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,512
Oh he let me win.
It makes me feel old.

255
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,996
I'm Glad to see you made it back safely.

256
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,153
I hear you met with a number
of obstacles.

257
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,116
Yes. Fortunqtely your friend
Nicomede proved to be a valuable ally.

258
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,154
I never had a chance to thank you...

259
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,759
...for saving my life.

260
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,838
You defied Sylla.

261
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,150
He told you to devorce your wife and you
said no even though it meant sudden death.

262
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,513
That impressed me.

263
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,350
And it ...
reminded me of something.

264
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,753
You see my friend,

265
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,831
Sylla once told me
to devorce my wife.

266
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,668
And unlike you I obeyed him.

267
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,835
I left the one woman I loved.

268
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,115
Life is full of lessons .

269
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,676
So we tought each other
a thing of two.

270
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,513
Tell me how to get where
you are now.

271
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,400
Don't tell me I was wrong
to hope you were spared.

272
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,599
I have something to give to Rome.

273
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,157
But I have no voice.

274
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,114
If you want a voice in Rome,

275
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,514
Win the people,
Speak from your heart...

276
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,871
And when you make apromise,
Keep it.

277
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,030
Pompée...

278
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,879
Ipromise you
if you ever need my help...

279
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,835
...just give me a sign,
I'll come to your aid.

280
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,111
My name is Julius Caesar.

281
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,431
I'm here to honor
my wife, Cornelia...

282
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,275
...publicly
and for the last time.

283
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,999
She was a good woman.

284
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,872
She gave no thought to her own wellbeing.

285
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,550
Only to the wellbeing of others.

286
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,759
Rome was her first and greatest love.

287
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,870
We shared that love.

288
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,479
We dreamt of a Rome
without dictators.

289
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
Where sons never raise their
hands against their fathers.

290
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,317
Where brothers never raise
their swords against brothers.

291
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,275
Where Romans lived at peace
with fellow Romans by their side.

292
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,034
I ask you now to join with me,

293
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,318
In honoring not only the
memory of my good wife,

294
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,838
But in memory of all the good men and
women who have died fighting for a better Rome.

295
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,670
People of Rome, I, Julius Caesar,

296
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,788
make you this promise on the
body of my beloved wife...

297
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,751
...I will not rest until the Rome
she dreamed of is the Rome we live in.

298
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,799
Join me.

299
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,473
By not only the nephew
to our beloved Marius,

300
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,799
Who fought against the evils of Sylla
who took his life from him.

301
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,033
But I'm also a son of the Julia,

302
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,273
Who are descendents of the goddess Venus herself.

303
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,152
I offer you my hand.

304
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,199
A power supreme amongst mortal men,

305
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,793
Granted by the gods
superior to kings.

306
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,910
Let us work together comrades,

307
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,193
in our quest for an empire,
that is boundless,

308
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,432
united ...and free.

309
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,155
We shall have to watch him.

310
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,351
Or use him.

311
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,474
Good morning to you, Caesar...

312
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,239
Hail Caesar.

313
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,557
Greetings, Caesar.
Julia, I have something for you.

314
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,872
Now then... Ah here it is.

315
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,551
And I hope it will make you smile.

316
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,715
That's the first I seen
you smile in weeks.

317
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,312
Stop it all of you !

318
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,195
There is nothing he can do about it.

319
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,119
What happened ?
- The price of bread has tripled.

320
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,910
There is no grain in Rome.
--Why ?

321
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,471
Because the grain supply from Egypt
was cut off by pirates.

322
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,069
Half of Rome is without bread.

323
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,919
The city is close to panic.

324
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,350
Only the very rich can afford bread.

325
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,588
We must fight the pirates now or
Rome will be crippled forever.

326
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,914
So I propose that Pompee be given leigons
to attack this problem once and for all.

327
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,152
It's not a question of wether or
not we fight pirates,

328
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,555
It's a matter of how.

329
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,154
I propose we equip ten small armies to fight
the pirates at different parts of the coast.

330
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,556
So the pirates can destroy Rome
one two by the time ?

331
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,513
The pirates are a bunch of
uneducated hoodlems.

332
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,395
I hardly think they could stand
against a Roman assualt of any size.

333
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,194
Lets talk about things are gentlemen.

334
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,357
Not the way we would like then to be.

335
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,316
I can attest to the threat posed by these scavengers.
I was a victem of one of their assults myself.

336
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,036
Then perhaps you will regale us
with your sea stories Gaius Julius

337
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,557
In the tavern after the work
of the senate is done.

338
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,437
The work of the senate
is rarely done.

339
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,236
You see there are not thousands of pirates
in our waters. But hundreds of thousands.

340
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,398
Enough for all the rogue bands
preying on single vessles.

341
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,472
There are pirate admirals seeking,

342
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,639
With thousands of ships and troops
more skilled in naval combat even than our own.

343
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,913
Pretty speaches like this won't
even cook our lunch.

344
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,111
No speeches do as little
work as the senate.

345
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,075
How dare this arogent newcomer
insult this Auguste body ?

346
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,193
Auguste and plump, Bibulus,
like your own body.

347
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,518
Apparent from ardent chatter and inactivity.

348
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,031
Enough,...enough,...enough!

349
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,788
We have a man in our company who can
resolve this conflict with the pirates.

350
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,590
But do we honor him with that duty ?
No.

351
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,997
I'm with Caesar,
we have no bread.

352
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,592
Now are we a great empire or
are we going to be ruled by outlaws ?

353
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,352
To perform this commission,

354
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,996
Pompée will have to be given
an army twice the size

355
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,352
of the one Sylla used to take Rome

356
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,116
Have we learned nothing from the past ?

357
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,953
I see Rome should go hungary because Cato
can't find a single man he can trust.

358
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,519
Not any man with an army would take the state.

359
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,752
Not every man is a Sylla.

360
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,160
some men are ruled by circunstances but men
of character bend circumstances to their will.

361
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,833
They make nature behave in such a way that
their will is carried out on this earth.

362
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,712
They defy the elements.

363
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,958
And sometimes defy their own base of nature.

364
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,358
In order to see their ideals come
alive before their eyes.

365
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,316
Pompée is such a man.

366
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,358
Those of you who have lived know one
thing to keep the nation small.

367
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,711
Civil strife.

368
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,517
Tribes fighting tribes rather than
banding together in one arm of power.

369
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,473
As long as we fight in this room

370
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,355
seeking personal victories,
enacting petty revenges,

371
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,757
Rome will stay small !

372
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,708
I propose we put our opinions aside
and let one feeling rule us for a time

373
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,348
The love of Rome.

374
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,357
I propose we put our strengths
together and become a force

375
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,108
The world has never seen.

376
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,477
I propose you let a man...

377
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,753
...a single man,
lead us out of the dark.

378
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,993
I propose Pompée.

379
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,874
All those in favor.

380
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,839
Marcus...
- Julia.

381
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,110
Julia... look at you.

382
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,718
Brutus, wake up and tell Julia
how beautiful she looks.
.

383
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,956
Beautiful.
- You like it ?

384
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,231
All dressed for Pompée's triumph...

385
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,598
Who's going with me ?

386
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,036
None of you wants to join
the counsel of Rome ?

387
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,989
No offense, father, but do you really think we're
going to trail around with your lecters around.

388
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,670
Rome's greatest general has returned.
And we want to be free to run and follow him...

389
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,552
Run yes,...run...run

390
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,952
Go and enjoy yourselfs.

391
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,758
Come on.
- Thank you pompus.

392
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,553
Brutus ? Arent you going with them?

393
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,633
I want to return this to Apollonius.
- What is this ?

394
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,356
´Ah yes the Plato's law... Did you read it ?
- Yes.

395
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,834
And ?

396
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,993
Plato thinks that democracy is doomed to faliure.

397
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,438
He thinks that a state should
be run by a dictator.

398
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,999
A dictator who's become
enlightened through experience and learning.

399
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,159
I don't think plato would get
along with your uncle Cato.

400
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,477
Brutus ! Hurry up !
- Come on !

401
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,556
Hurry and catch up with your friends
or you'll have to come along with me.

402
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,558
See you at the ceremony.

403
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,518
Goodbye, father.

404
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,033
See, See...

405
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,398
Do you know what i want ?

406
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,312
Thank you for your kindness.

407
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,959
Let me take care of my son now..

408
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,919
Mother...
- Shh... rest.

409
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,837
Something happened to me there.

410
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,634
It's a affliction no more no less.

411
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,952
Your grandfather suffered the same
spells and lived into old age.

412
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,434
Name something else.

413
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,553
What happen I was watching Pompée.

414
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,518
He's been a friend to me.

415
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,395
We speak together easily like brothers.

416
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,997
Yet we couldn't be more different.

417
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,151
He's a great army leader.

418
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,473
His province has made him the richest
and most powerful man in Rome.

419
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,869
Your father wanted you to be a statesman
and now you are a counsel of Rome.

420
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,158
Happened to be beyond his dreams.

421
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,512
I need an army.

422
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,870
To turn yourself into a Pompée ?

423
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,310
How would you pay and feed such an army ?

424
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,989
Your counselship already costs a fortune.

425
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,033
Yes, I am counsel and I am broke.

426
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,671
Your attack today was stronger than usual.

427
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,949
There was something else mother, this
attack was different in other ways.

428
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,952
How ?

429
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,870
I saw something.

430
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,070
I saw something at that moment.

431
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,951
Not just about myself.

432
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,548
But about the whole humankind.

433
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,876
How we keep ourselves small.

434
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,594
Then  I realized I had not been inspired.

435
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,672
And as I watched pompee I saw
that he was not inspired.

436
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,952
And he would never be inspired.

437
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,959
And I realized the difference
between Pompee and me.

438
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,038
Pompée has merely done something.

439
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,550
But I, am for something.

440
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,156
I need légions.

441
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,038
Pompée has them.

442
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,077
He will lend them to me.

443
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,194
Why would pompee do that
diminishing his own power.

444
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,232
What could you offer him in return
to equal the value of an army ?

445
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,677
We trust in the wisdom of our fathers

446
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,759
And in their laws. and I, Cato,
trust in him.

447
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,758
Hail Pompée !

448
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,678
Cato, you flatter me.

449
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,788
But let us give credit to another man.

450
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,958
For I could not have fought
a war across the sea

451
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,313
Without knoledge that Rome was
in safe hands here at home.

452
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,633
For that we owe a debt of gratitude
to my friend and fellow council,

453
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,912
Gaius Julius Caesar !

454
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,231
Hail Caesar !

455
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,879
This is my daughter, Julia.
- Yes I know we've met.

456
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,998
It would honor my house if you
would give us a recitation.

457
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,431
Not in front of so many people ?
- You've done it in larger groups than this.

458
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,513
Father I assure you that I'm
not prepared for it.

459
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,158
Come...

460
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,319
The daughter of Caesar will recite for us.

461
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,233
Tonight,

462
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,114
Stands beside me and prays with me

463
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,234
A man dear to me and dear to the gods.

464
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,274
Mightier in victory than
the kings of Mycènes

465
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,869
With their golden haired horses.

466
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,590
And stronger more than the battle ghosts

467
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,996
That ride the shores of  Troy.

468
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,393
Hear me,

469
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,520
Sons of gold headed men.

470
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,758
Hear me sing the victory

471
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,794
Of a man dear to me and to the Goda.

472
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,390
Its really nothing.
- No, Its not your fault.

473
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,873
I'm not sure who's fault it is but I assure you I
will find out and he will be punished severly.

474
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,555
Thank you, counciler.

475
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,670
What is your name ?
- Calpurnia.

476
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,470
From who's house ?
- Lucius Piso.

477
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,436
I'm sorry for staring,
I thought perhaps...

478
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,708
...we met somewhere before.

479
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,876
Would you like to eat together ?
- I'd be delighted.

480
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,593
What hour do you call this ?

481
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,274
I think it's known as the fifth hour.
- Yes, The sun is comming up.

482
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,512
You're right, I was out with him.

483
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,958
We drank and ate and had entertainment.

484
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,919
He cares for me.
- Ah yes, he's twice your age.

485
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,229
And your friend remember.

486
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,592
Yes, he is my friend.

487
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,028
I just want to know if he
treats you with respect.

488
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,513
I like him... I do.

489
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,275
I don't love him not yet but ,

490
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,392
..that may come

491
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,674
Why are you behaving in such a manner ?

492
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,838
He is council.

493
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,236
He's the first man in Rome.

494
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,113
He has légions.

495
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,480
The price is high.

496
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,556
What price ?  It's customary for
the father to offer a dowery.

497
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,639
You know I have nothing to give you.

498
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,232
I accept.

499
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,074
I want a commission.

500
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,560
Gaul.
- Gaul ? It's taken.

501
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,117
By Cassius.
- I need a victory in battle.

502
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,071
Your not experinced enough in
warfare and you need legions.

503
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,518
Your légions...

504
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,355
She's all I got,
...I want 50 thousand for her.

505
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,913
50 000 talents ?

506
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,315
Soldiers.

507
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,553
How could you do it ?

508
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,150
How could you take my commission away ?

509
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,954
Because I think Caesar's
the right man for Gaul.

510
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,354
But I've put my staff to considerable
expense preparing my men.

511
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,790
And you'll be re-embursed.
- What ?

512
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,275
And I'll propose that you will
look after the garrison.

513
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,518
The garrison ?
- This won't do, Pompée.

514
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,669
We should put this before the senate...
- Lets not talk business...

515
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,356
...At my wedding.

516
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:11,069
It may tempt bad luck.

517
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,436
I have a confession to make.

518
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,074
What's that ?

519
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,235
We did meet before.
or rather...

520
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,356
...I met you
but you didn't meet me.

521
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,799
It was at the Pompée triumph.

522
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,314
You fell.

523
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,678
Nobody saw it but me.

524
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,437
I held you  to make sure you wouldn't hurt yourself.
- Thank you.

525
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,838
It shames me.

526
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,435
I never know when its
going to happen.

527
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,032
Many believe those who
have the condition

528
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,396
are holy...

529
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,150
...Blessed by God.

530
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,753
Perhaps.

531
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,438
What do you suppose a child of both our
faces blended together would look like ?

532
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,152
I think that it would look  rather beautiful.

533
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,632
Do you ?

534
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,959
Is it something you'd like to find out ?
- Yes.

535
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,756
Are you sure ?

536
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,989
I am less sure about my own name
than I am about this.

537
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,355
I am terible to have to ask.
- We have servants.

538
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,790
And if I want to go to bed early?

539
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,036
I'll follow you.

540
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,349
Ceasar...

541
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,075
You must make me a promise.
- Anything you like.

542
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,590
Come back from this war alive.

543
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,912
I promise you.

544
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,193
And hurry.
- That's two promises.

545
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,193
And win it.
- That's three promises.

546
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,715
Now it is your turn to promise me one thing.

547
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,078
Will you marry me before I leave.

548
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,752
How many dead ?
- In the region of 23 000 Celtes.

549
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,871
And Romans ?
- 1 12.

550
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,874
I'll have to prepare the burial back in Rome.

551
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,391
We're not returning to Rome.
We're going farther north.

552
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,871
There's a lot more of Rome out there.

553
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,396
Just has'nt called Rome yet.

554
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,396
The Romans !

555
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,715
We must tell Ceasar to retreat.

556
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,589
What I gave to Ceasar,
I will not revoke.

557
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,554
Wait !
Put down your blades.

558
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,758
Why have you come here ?

559
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,231
This land is ours,
you have no right to be here .

560
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,712
What is your name ?

561
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,753
Vercingétorix.

562
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,189
You stayed to fight alone ?
- This is my house.

563
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,632
I built it with my own hands.
And you'll burn it down.

564
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,909
You're free to go.

565
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,995
Give me a horse.

566
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,716
You heard him.

567
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,792
Give him a horse.

568
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,230
My dear Ceasar,

569
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,993
The people speak of you with admiration.

570
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,109
Some call you the great as
they called Pompée.

571
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,678
In the market people sometimes
bow to me as they pass.

572
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,718
You will also be delighted to know

573
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,352
The mariage that began as an advantage,
has blossomed into romance.

574
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,517
Watching Julia and Pompée together
delights me and saddens me.

575
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,109
That you're not here.

576
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,790
No one could be prouder to be
your wife, Ceasar.

577
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,196
But after so long without you,

578
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,438
I fear
I'm getting used to my solitude.

579
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,075
Come home soon my darling.

580
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,273
Until then I will be waiting.

581
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,553
Ceasar has killed 300 000 Celtes.

582
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,391
He attacked peaceful villages,
villages who pay taxes to the  Roman state.

583
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,829
Its beyond tolleration !

584
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,237
This is how you thank a great Roman general ?

585
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,715
Ceasar sent
100 000 slaves back to Rome.

586
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,956
Are you saying you havent taken any of them?

587
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,471
Then if any come from him I would have
got them from somewhere else.

588
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,391
Pompée, you have to be warry.

589
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,478
He's been away three years
fighting with your légions.

590
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,751
He's doubled their salary.

591
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,430
They are totally devoted  to him.

592
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,712
My lords,
As Cicero has put it so well:

593
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,277
Strain every nerve for the
preservation of the state.

594
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,472
Look in every corner for the storms.

595
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,515
They will burst upon you if
you do not see them in time.

596
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,998
I just remembered who he is !

597
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,390
What are you talking about ?
- That man.

598
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,193
Marc Antoine ?

599
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,474
Running from his debtors in Rome
to find wealth in the provinces.

600
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,352
Like all of us.
- not me !

601
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,075
I still fight for the glory of Rome.

602
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,440
My calvery has been attacked.
- By who ?

603
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,315
Gaél tribesmen. 14 000 dead.
- 14 000 ?

604
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,359
And many more wounded.
They acted under one leader.

605
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,911
His name is Vercingétorix.

606
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,955
Where could we find him ?
- In Alésia.

607
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,311
How long is the march ?
- Eight days.

608
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,356
Vercingétorix is in there
With 18 000 of his men.

609
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,438
Its the most invincible
stronghold in Gaul.

610
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,314
We'll never break it.
- We won't have to break it.

611
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,036
We'll build a wall around their city.

612
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,880
We'll trap them inside and starve them.

613
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,829
Noboby has ever built a
fortification of that length.

614
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,431
Then we will be the first.

615
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,435
Let's not waste time.

616
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,997
What do you want ?

617
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,995
I'm here to see Pompée.
- Come here.

618
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,954
Cato...
- Pompée.

619
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,633
Julia...

620
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,155
What brings you to Pisa ?

621
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,797
I've come to speak with you.

622
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,075
Your absence in Rome has been..
criticized.

623
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,356
As you can see,
my wife needs me here.

624
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,236
Can we speak privately ?

625
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,032
What's the matter, Cato ? Did your conversation
depend on speaking ill of my father ?

626
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,078
Sit, sit , Cato.

627
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,795
Thank you.

628
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,913
Ceasar is about to take the
last stronghold in gaul.

629
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,320
Vercingétorix has called for every tribe
from the mountains to the sea.

630
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,956
They are on the move toward Alésia.

631
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,073
How many men ?

632
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,632
Two hundred and fifty thousand.

633
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,949
And my husband ?
- Forty thousand.

634
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:10,836
He'll survive.
He has survived these many years.

635
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,675
He's never been up against so much.

636
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,357
Is this true ?
Will my husband lose this time ?

637
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,308
I don't know noone knows
the outcome of war.

638
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,239
You are consul, Pompée.
Do something.

639
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,872
If ceasar wins this battle...
- He will become the next Sylla.

640
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,958
Thats what you were going to say
was'nt it ?

641
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,471
That if he wins he will
become the next Sylla...

642
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,911
Why are you worried, Cato ?

643
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,473
You said he didn't stand a
chance against the Gauls.

644
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,359
Why call him back ?

645
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,635
Why not leave him there to fight
this battle to his own death ?

646
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:56,113
If you leave him there your next
Sylla will extinguish himself.

647
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,830
Your waiting for my husband to fail,
Aren't you ?

648
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,636
And so are you.

649
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,276
To arms !

650
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,439
This is it.

651
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,119
Soldiers at the gate !

652
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,470
He's trying to fool us into
gathering our troups here.

653
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,229
How do you know what he'll do ?

654
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,273
Because that's what I would do

655
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,718
I will wait here for
Vercingétorix to make his move.

656
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,310
His men are to weak to
attack our main camp.

657
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,717
He will move his calvery here and
try to break through the main wall

658
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,798
While his allies attack from the outside.

659
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,197
We cannot let these two
forces join together.

660
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,599
If they do,
We will not survive.

661
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,189
We must hold out !

662
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,272
Retreat !

663
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,630
Ceasar your men are asking for you.

664
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,592
It is with great sadness that
I write this letter to you my dear husband.

665
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,514
Your Julia gave birth early and
she suffered some pain in doing so.

666
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,314
The doctors were there
and did what they could to ease her suffering.

667
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,676
The child wasa boy but frail
their efforts could not save him.

668
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,989
He looked like you Caesar,
there was nobility in his face.

669
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,392
Your daughter struggled to
sustain this tragic birth.

670
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,712
But in the end she could not.

671
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,916
Pompée has kept himself from the senate,
prefering instead to pass time in no company.

672
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,876
He walks around the graveyard again and again,

673
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,476
Keeping fresh garlands on her tomb.

674
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,078
We take Alésia in the morning
.

675
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,029
Open the gate.

676
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,631
I know your only enemy is one man
and he is standing before you now..

677
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,836
I'm giving myself to you, Ceasar.

678
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,320
Our women died for us.

679
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,678
I give you my own life
so that you may let my men live.

680
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,030
If my men die there will be
nothing left of the Gauls,

681
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,073
and noone left to worship our gods.

682
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,113
I beg you.

683
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,390
Enslave my people if you need to.

684
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,716
But let them live.

685
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,193
Your men will live.

686
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,231
My dear wife,

687
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,798
You'll have to wait a bit more
before we're together again.

688
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,755
You see there are those in Rome
who would have me branded an outlaw.

689
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,316
So I have sent Mark Antony to
talk to the senate on my behalf.

690
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,433
Since there has never been a
soldier with an army such as mine

691
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,632
who would return to Rome
without taking her by force,

692
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:36,913
I too must be planning
such an assault,..but my crime is worse

693
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,749
Because I return
not in dishonor, but in triumph.

694
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,110
And this the senate cannot tolerate.

695
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,710
How long ago did Sylla ride
into town with his army,

696
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,993
Breaking the sacred Roman law stating
no man!

697
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,317
Must bring armed men past the
Rubicon into Rome.

698
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,754
How fresh in your memories does
bloodshed have to be ? for you to show caution.

699
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,192
Ceasar has done more for Rome than
any other general in its history. How do you respond...

700
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,598
You strip him of his councilship
in his absence without explanation.

701
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,429
He 's more than doubled the size of Rome
in the last eight years and what do you ask him to do.

702
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,837
Lay down his arms.

703
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,270
It's not  Ceasar, who is the criminal.

704
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,598
It is this senate !

705
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,869
This senate represents the
people of Rome.

706
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:29,948
This senate,
represents its own interests.

707
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,039
Sylla said the very same thing.
.

708
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,596
If he said it, he was right.

709
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,278
But the difference between
Sylla and Ceasaris

710
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,792
The people feared Sylla, Ceasar they love..

711
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,552
You know nothing...

712
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,638
...of peoples feelings.

713
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,229
Your right I don't.

714
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,358
Let me ask them.

715
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:14,949
People of Rome, I come to you
with questions from  Ceasar.

716
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,115
He wants to know what you want
so he can better serve your need.

717
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,550
The senate says they
represents the people.

718
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,396
But the senate wants Ceasar to lay
down his arms, and return to Rome as a man,

719
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:32,356
Not as a soldier.
And when he arrives, The senate

720
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,996
Will find him guilty of
crimes against the state.

721
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:41,195
Ceasar's crime is spending eight
years in battle, outside of Rome,

722
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,190
With none of the comforts we take for
granted with a daily treat to his life. Why ?

723
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,392
So he can bring wealth to the Roman people.

724
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,358
Temples, libraries, holidays and games...

725
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,838
Are all funded by Cesars levies in Gaul.
Yet what do they think in the senate ?

726
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,991
They think he's doing this for personal gains...
I ask you

727
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,195
If he's doing this for private gain,
Why does he stay in  Gaul ?

728
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,793
Why does he live in a tent ?

729
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,109
I, know why he does it.

730
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:21,150
He does it so we, Romans,
can live well.

731
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,879
What are you going to do about this ?

732
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,071
Whatever these men may think,

733
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,512
some of whom have never been
up on a horse's back,

734
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,828
I have never known a man
tougher on the enemies of Rome

735
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,680
nor gentler to his friends.

736
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,713
When I call myself a Roman,

737
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,834
The thing that makes me most proud,

738
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,714
Is to share that title with one other man.

739
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,549
A man who it has been my
privilage to fight beside.

740
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,195
A man
that has shown time and again

741
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,916
That he loves his own life
less than he loves yours.

742
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,317
His name is Caius Julius Caesar !

743
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,029
We must do something, Pompée.

744
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,392
Caesar could march on Rome
any time.

745
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:43,390
I'm not going to wait for him to come to us,
I'll gather our troups.

746
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:47,036
And attack him before he
sets foot in Rome.

747
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,711
I'm going to wipe him and his
legions off the face of the earth.

748
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,308
Men,
we have two choices.

749
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:12,635
We can be slaughtered by the army
Pompee is massing against us.

750
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,111
Or we can fight for our lives,

751
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,393
Just as we have done every
day for eight years.

752
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,670
I've made my decision.

753
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,788
I'm going to Rome.

754
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,954
I'm going to cross the Rubicon.

755
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,190
Will anyone be comming with me ?

756
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,750
To Rome !
Let the dice fly.

757
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,830
my legions from Spain
should bear up to Austria from the west.

758
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:59,434
The Thracerons will come to us from the north.
and from the east the Macédoniens.

759
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,314
Caesar is on his way to Rome.

760
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,393
How far is he ?
- Four days from here.

761
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,877
That's impossible !
- I heard it from Bibulus himself.

762
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,879
Caesar has passed the Rubicon.

763
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:20,196
We must leave Rome.
We cannot defend it without troups.

764
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,274
We'll go to Greese.

765
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:28,156
We'll amass what strength we can,
And then we'll take him in Rome itself.

766
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,000
I only hope
we don't arrive too late

767
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:35,068
And find the bodies of our
friends on the senate steps.

768
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,920
It has been decreed by the new senate

769
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:07,718
That the title of dictator is
bestowed on Caius Julius Caesar.

770
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,988
It is decreed

771
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,272
There will be fifty days of
thanksgiving in his honor.

772
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:20,071
He is given the courts and
elected counsol for life.

773
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,197
Hail Caesar !

774
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,877
You treat me as a king.

775
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,238
Though I assure that is one
role I shall never adopt.

776
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,959
I am Caesar, and only Caesar.

777
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,789
It is for this crown alone
I conqured Gaul.

778
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,995
Caesar...

779
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,478
Caesar !

780
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,630
Beware the ides of march.

781
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,478
The ides of march.

782
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,872
Beware.

783
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:10,309
The men and women of Rome
are crying out for your head.

784
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,552
For a moment ,
I saw them as you do.

785
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,513
You don't know how I see them.

786
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,109
I was disgusted with them.

787
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,910
How do you keep your purpose
clear in your mind ?

788
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,512
When i met you in your village, I could
see you had your purpose clear in your mind.

789
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,233
And it was pure.

790
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,156
I can see that it hasen't changed.

791
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,670
What could you do to preserve it?

792
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,914
You want to know ?

793
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:49,790
Yes.

794
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,915
I only fight my enemies.

795
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,748
You think
we are similar, Don't you ?

796
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:06,315
Thats why it pains you to see me die.

797
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,034
We are very different, you and me.

798
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,237
I know when its over.

799
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:16,069
And what's left isn't worth having.

800
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:25,636
Give me the honor of dying alone
By my own hand.

801
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:30,831
Instead of in a public spectacle
of your Roman mob.

802
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,671
I have to do what the people want,
I have no choice.

803
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,911
I thought power gave you more
choice, not less.

804
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,915
Listen to them. Do you hear that ?

805
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,078
For pity sake, give me a sword.

806
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,916
Have him dead within an hour.

807
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,353
Hail Caesar.

808
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,598
The ranks here are depleted.

809
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,553
My men will be joining you.

810
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,280
How shall we explain to the people

811
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,869
That these men have become senators ?

812
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,796
They haven't been selected by
the provisional leaders
.

813
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,071
The law is changed.

814
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,116
And keep in mind the
people trust my jugement.

815
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,469
You will be joined by my finest men.

816
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,513
I've spent eight years
with them in Gaul.

817
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:12,550
I must leave for Greece
to fight Pompée.

818
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,833
I'm leaving Rome in Mark Antony's capable charge.
- Do we have no say in this ?

819
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,953
I don't want to distract
you with bureaucracy.

820
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:27,030
I'd rather leave you free to
argue matters of the state.

821
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,518
You think there will be black lists...

822
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,070
There won't be any lists.

823
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,069
Sylla killed his enemies,
I forgive mine.

824
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:44,750
Good day to you, gentlemen.

825
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,750
They left in a hurry.

826
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,074
Attention Caesar !

827
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,355
I did not cross the Rubicon to kill old friends.

828
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,152
I did it to protect myself
against my enemies.

829
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,596
I hope we can secure ourselfs
through mercy and not vengefulness.

830
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:33,309
Your all free to go.
- We owe, all our lives to Caesar.

831
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,718
Did you say something,my old friend ?

832
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,715
I thought I heard you speak.

833
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,715
I'm grateful for your clemency.

834
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,709
Brutus, Come dine with me.

835
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,392
Caesar...
make peace with Pompée.

836
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,912
For years,
His only hope was that one day,

837
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:11,636
You would rule Rome,
together again...

838
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,875
With what ?

839
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,239
With Julia,
uniting you both.

840
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,874
He tolerated me,
Because he loved Julia so much.

841
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:27,438
Caesar he loved Julia because
he saw you in her.

842
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:32,472
He told me that Julia's death
made life unbearable.

843
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,511
And add to that the end of your friendship.
He counted his life as finished.

844
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,669
I'll make peace with him
if peace is what you want.

845
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:46,279
I want to establish some sanity in Rome.

846
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:50,392
The people had enough of fighting.

847
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,950
Will you help me ?
- How can I help you ?

848
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,755
I want you to go back to Rome
and be my préteur.

849
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,709
If peace is what you want,

850
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,108
Then it will be my honor to serve you.

851
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,789
Pompée has gone to Egypt.

852
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,636
The king died, leaving trone to be squabbled over
by a twelve year old boy and eighteen year old girl.

853
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,273
Ptolémée and Cleopatra ?

854
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:26,028
I don't know which one I trust less.

855
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:31,314
Help me ready the ships.
I'll follow him in the morning.

856
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,553
You don't need to take troups with you.

857
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,956
Pompée has gon to egypt alone.
the troups went to Utica.

858
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,959
With youruncle Cato ?
- yes.

859
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:57,036
Trust me, Brutus.

860
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,116
Whoever wants peace, will have it.

861
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:20,439
He was most cruely murdered on
the palace steps by his own men.

862
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:24,272
It's rumored that they were
bribed by Pothinus.

863
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,278
By Caesar.

864
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:32,676
There's only one enemy left.

865
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:03,039
I am Pothinus,
chief of the ruling counsul.

866
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:07,836
In the name of king Ptolémée,
I welcome you , Caesar.

867
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,111
Your king is very generous,

868
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:14,632
But as you can see, we haven't brought any horses.

869
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,639
This grain is for your men sir.

870
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,434
My men will eat indoors, Pothinus.

871
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:24,156
I'm sure you will put us up very
comfortably, in your palace.

872
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:27,233
I'll tell you the truth, Caesar.

873
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,308
Ptolémée fears for his life.

874
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,194
There's been a great deal of
discord in Egypt.

875
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,040
So he has forbidden all visitors.

876
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,189
You, of course, are very welcome in the palace.

877
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,273
And my men.

878
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,554
And your men.

879
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:53,877
Pothinus, you wouldn't have anything to do
with helping the king make his decisions ?

880
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,675
Would you ?
- The king is a boy sir.

881
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,155
Forgive him, and forgive me.

882
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,839
We are your allies and your
servants great  Caesar.

883
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,873
We only have the interests
of Rome in our hearts.

884
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,469
Bring out the gift.

885
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,390
This is Pompée's ring...

886
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,510
Where is he ?

887
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,916
We thought you'd be pleased.

888
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,393
Excuse me, Caesar.

889
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,275
There is aservant with an urgent
message from Cleopatra.

890
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,232
Bring her.

891
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,994
If you want to hear the message
you'll have to dismiss your guard.

892
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:15,032
What word from Cleopatra is
of such importance ?

893
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:18,719
Cleopatra asks for your protection.

894
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,194
Protection, why ?

895
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,510
Pothinus plans to kill her,
as he did Pompée.

896
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,349
Is that why you are disguised
as your own servant...

897
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:37,198
...Cleopatra ?

898
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,516
I came to you, Caesar,

899
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:53,156
Because you are the only
man I can trust.

900
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,038
Why does Pothinus want to kill you ?

901
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:02,440
My father wanted me to rule Egypt,
he wrote it in his will .

902
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,435
But Pothinus banished me with
a price on my head.

903
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,629
Now any servant can kill me
and be rewarded for it.

904
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,271
Caesar...

905
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,157
You and I, are alike.

906
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:29,198
You are the son of Vénus,
and I, am the daughter of Isis.

907
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:36,272
You and I, live by the same
devine heart beat.

908
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,473
That's why we must help each other.
- Are you trying to seduce me ?

909
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,118
I don't try.

910
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:46,796
I seduce...

911
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,676
...or I don't.

912
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:54,352
I do not have to seduce with my body.

913
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,477
I have something much better than that.

914
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,119
My country...

915
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,992
...It is the richest land in the world.

916
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,749
Egypt and Rome are different.

917
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,519
Rome is masculine.

918
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,910
Egypt is feminine.

919
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:22,557
Rome, is sunlight, Egypt is twilight.

920
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,673
But its not part of Rome not yet.

921
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,709
Make me queen, and the east
and west will be united.

922
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:38,153
We will be god and godess
ruling the world.

923
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,230
You kiss me with the tongue of a serpent.

924
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,909
I must test you to see if you are poison.

925
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:23,714
And am I ?
- No, but I can taste Gaul.

926
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,674
Will you stay in Egypt with me Caesar ?
- What does Egypt have to offer

927
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:33,953
That Rome does not ?
- Have you heard of the fertile cressant ?

928
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:37,238
Is it the region down bellow ?
- It is it is !

929
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,999
What grows there ?

930
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:42,033
I believe the region fertile
enough to haunt a king.

931
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,756
If you doubt it try planting
something there !

932
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,316
Only promise me one thing.

933
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:52,832
When you return to Rome,
you must be fateful to me.

934
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,998
But I'm married , I'm,
already being unfateful.

935
01:45:56,280 --> 01:46:00,191
With you ! - What does married
compared to state and politics.

936
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,195
Demand you give  yourself to a woman.

937
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,189
In politics you lie you're unfaithful.

938
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,789
- We'll bury him with honors.
I'll bury him myself

939
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:45,438
.Let the state celebrate his life.
- Which state ? Rome ?

940
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:48,556
The Rome of Caesar ?

941
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:52,078
To accept your honors
would defile my name.

942
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:54,999
And on behalf of my
father and my family,

943
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,157
I decline.

944
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,597
Now I'm asking you to leave this room.

945
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:30,119
There is no peace in the
world like in my house.

946
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,077
Calpurnia...

947
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,155
Would you greet your husband
with a kiss ?

948
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,793
Dismiss them.

949
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:06,918
Can't a man return to his home and
expect a warmer mood from his wife ?

950
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,797
How could you bring her to Rome ?

951
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,194
It was for the good of the state.

952
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,991
Cleopatra rules a large part of africa.

953
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,555
And all of you.

954
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,269
Noone rules me Calpurnia.

955
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,756
Not Cleopatra, not even you.

956
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,037
But what I want is the love that you
promised me when we married.

957
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:40,757
You can't have it. You can have my
obediance, you can have my loyalty.

958
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,510
But I can't love those
who dishonor me.

959
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:47,873
No one can dishonored you.
- You're right I dishonored myself

960
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:52,073
When I gave my vows to you in mariage.
- You made a good mariage you're Ceasar's wife!

961
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:56,273
I should have married a man other than Ceasar,
That would have been a good mariage.

962
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,553
So I wouldn't have to watch my
husband perform for Egypt every night.,

963
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,957
in order to keep the riches of
that land flowing into Rome.

964
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,870
Between you and Cleopatra,
I don't know who is a concubine !

965
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:12,114
Retain your dignity ther's a limit
to what I'll hear from you.

966
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,069
I have no dignity left.

967
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,274
Perhaps I ought to buy some.

968
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:26,638
Maybe I should learn like you have,
that you can be bought and sold.

969
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:30,037
What's the price? What's the
price of consulship these days ?

970
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:33,039
What's the price of being king ?

971
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,358
When did your hope leave
and vision for the people

972
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:42,553
become this lust
for power itself ?

973
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,956
Was it when Julia died ?

974
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:06,476
I have nowhere else to go
so I'll stay here.

975
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:11,315
But I'll live apart from you,
not as man and wife.

976
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,149
May the gods forgive me for
breaking my mariage vows.

977
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:22,274
But I pray they forgive you for breaking yours.

978
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,120
You're an early riser, Brutus.

979
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,468
So are you.

980
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,354
Lately I am.

981
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:51,239
I couldn't sleep last night worrying
about the honor of your name.

982
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,834
You know something about these ?

983
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,039
I know the writting, but
don't ask me who wrote them.

984
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,959
Minds change quickly in
these troubled times.

985
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:07,471
And I take you to whoever doubt these men.

986
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,719
Oh Brutus i did my best to persuade
them that you are a man of honor,

987
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,719
Though you wouldn't pledge to
keep Ceasar from becoming king.

988
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,709
I gave you my pledge that I'd
oppose him in the senate.

989
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:23,236
But some of us feel that to oppose
a man like Ceasar with words

990
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,476
Is the same thing as handing him the crown.

991
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,718
I try to use words before the sword,
Cassius.

992
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,672
Just as I try to use reason before passion.

993
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,635
People say, calling on reason before
passion can lead to idleness.

994
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:39,630
And sometimes action is required. But
I know that you're a decent man

995
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:43,708
And that your meek and gentle nature
is how you feel you best serve the good.

996
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,560
I'm not gentle in defending my beliefs.

997
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:51,197
But you have given me no proof
that Ceasar will demand the crown.

998
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,040
Do you plan to be at the senate
at the calendes of March ?

999
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,833
No, I will be here.

1000
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:00,193
They say that on that day ceasar
will move that he be made king.

1001
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,072
I will come if I am sent for.
- Hu HU  This is what they mean.

1002
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:12,509
People say that this is weakness to come
when you are summoned and at no other time.

1003
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,315
To accept the favors of a
tyrant like Ceasar.

1004
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:18,353
He spared my life.
- But he took the life of Cato,

1005
01:54:18,640 --> 01:54:22,599
Your wife's father,
who treated you as a son.

1006
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,114
Has she ceased her mourning ?

1007
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,749
No, and neither have I.

1008
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:37,356
So you're greiving over Cato's death...
- Cassius, yes I'm greiving .

1009
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:41,792
But private affection and public
duty are not the same thing.

1010
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,436
And yet they say that in your grief,
you just weep and say prayers

1011
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:49,838
and fill your wife's drinking
cup and go to bed.

1012
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:54,190
And when Ceasar comes to you tonight you'll
be like his boy and fill his cup as well...

1013
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,436
Who is saying this ? Who ?

1014
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:59,234
I don't act for Ceasar.

1015
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,634
I act for  Rome,  ...Always for Rome.

1016
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:09,193
Brutus I've done everything to convince
them you're a man of action that you love Rome.

1017
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:13,798
I've spoken in your behalf many times singing
your praise, condeming those who speak against you.

1018
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:17,595
But...
some men have ideas.

1019
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:21,509
They think highly of those who gave
their lives to expell the kings from Rome.

1020
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:27,158
Your ancestors ! And they were
only men, not gods.

1021
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,229
Please don't stay.
- I am staying.

1022
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,513
Why do you want to torment yourself ?
- I won't be tormented.

1023
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,153
Will he ?

1024
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,070
Isn't that what you wanted to do ?

1025
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,749
It will be the best thing for all.

1026
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:06,798
I don't trust that you or any other
man knows what's best for Rome.

1027
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,798
I will take my seat.

1028
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:12,277
A woman has a right to see
varity, doesn't she  ?

1029
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,516
Calpurnia...

1030
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,869
Portia...

1031
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,669
Romans we're here to celebrate
the return of caesar !

1032
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:37,719
His return, not only with her majesty Cleopatra,
But with Egypt itself.

1033
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:43,274
Where he has transformed the richest land
in all the world. It is now not only Egypt,.

1034
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,468
It is egypt... and it is  Rome !

1035
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:16,076
I said before

1036
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,070
and I will say again...

1037
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,629
I will not be king of Rome.

1038
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,952
I an only Caesar.

1039
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,239
I need no crown...

1040
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,391
...to act on your behalf.

1041
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,552
Do you still believe that
ours is not just cause ?

1042
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,032
I'm with you.

1043
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,110
We have to act soon.

1044
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:15,630
We will wait when caesar brings the senate to order.

1045
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:18,753
Lépide will call for the elections.

1046
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,919
Casca, you will ask Caesar
to consider the petitions.

1047
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,949
You, Cassius,
Will step behind  Caesar.

1048
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:32,035
No man should go for his blade

1049
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:35,039
until we're all in reach of Caesar.

1050
02:02:35,320 --> 02:02:40,952
Every knife must enter Caesar's
body at least once.

1051
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:45,472
And if,.. we fail,

1052
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,919
our plot is discovered before we even begin,

1053
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,229
we turn our knives on ourselves,

1054
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,229
Without hesitation.
We all agreed ?

1055
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:01,508
For the senate. I will meet
with Caesar at Cleopatra's house.

1056
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,313
Go.

1057
02:03:41,360 --> 02:03:42,998
Brutus...

1058
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:47,390
Why are you pacing like that ?
- I'm concerned we will be late.

1059
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:49,352
Caesar !

1060
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,711
Calpurnia, What are you doing here ?

1061
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,995
I had a dream last night.
Please don't go out today.

1062
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:01,398
I'll come to you later,
at our home.

1063
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:04,797
I saw you slaughtered,
in your own blood.

1064
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:08,230
It was horrible.

1065
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:12,149
Well I cannot let dreams or flights
of birds direct my actions.

1066
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:16,479
I can't let you go.
I swallow my pride today to come to you,

1067
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:19,797
Because your life is more important
to me than my pride. Now you listen to me...

1068
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,230
The senate is conviened for the consul.

1069
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:27,479
They can't conduct one day of
business without their Caesar ?

1070
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:32,952
There are matters on the agenda which
can only be delt with by you Caesar.

1071
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,471
They can wait a day.
- And what should I tell the senate ?

1072
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:40,799
That their consul is at home,
Because his wife had a bad dream...

1073
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:47,438
As your friend Caesar,
I have to advise you on this.

1074
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:51,718
You called the senate together.

1075
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,198
Show them you're a man of intention.
Meet with your senate.

1076
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,669
They  are waiting for your guidance.

1077
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,990
I'll be with him ledi.

1078
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:08,840
I'll never leave his side.

1079
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,832
I'll come to you later.

1080
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,953
Hail Caesar !

1081
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,831
Portia...

1082
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:31,908
I'm not fit to be alone today.

1083
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:35,472
Sit down.

1084
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,799
Bring us some wine.
- Yes, let's have some wine.

1085
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,468
What business do we have today ?

1086
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:47,990
Two legal breifings,
And election for a questeur,

1087
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:50,953
and the petitions from the senate.

1088
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:54,869
Let's get the election out of the way.
_ The election

1089
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:04,318
I move we take the petitions, first.

1090
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:06,598
I called for the election the
election will commence.

1091
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:09,278
But a...

1092
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,958
Marcus Octavius, who is running for
the office, is not yet here.

1093
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:17,312
Petitioners, Then. Approach.

1094
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:25,796
I'm glad Caesar is with Brutus today.

1095
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:27,750
Why ?

1096
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:30,952
Last night I dreamth,
He was stabbed to death.

1097
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,070
Brutus...

1098
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:20,358
Caesar, I ask mercy for my exiled brother.

1099
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:24,435
Why are you petitioning what so
recently has been denied ?

1100
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,436
Who is the next petitioner?

1101
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:41,033
I want to ask mercy for my father
who has been put in jail.

1102
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:44,477
I ruled your father be in
prison and my word is law.

1103
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,473
Old man...

1104
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:51,752
You said something foretell
the ides of march.

1105
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:54,349
nothing has happened yet,
The ides have come.

1106
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:58,952
They have come,
but they've not yet gone.

1107
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:09,393
I want to ask for your pardon,
my great Caesar.

1108
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:13,229
And I pray for your soul.

1109
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,476
Stop it !

1110
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,673
Caesar !

1111
02:09:53,160 --> 02:09:54,798
Caesar is assinated !

1112
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:21,954
Brutus...
