1
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:31,187
- Come on, come on. It's all right.

2
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,384
Yes, yes, it's all right.

3
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:43,023
Wake up, Will.

4
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:51,694
Starboard bow ahoy!

5
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,139
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

6
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,216
Sounded like a bell.

7
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,784
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

8
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:12,698
Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.

9
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:31,016
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom!

10
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:47,773
- Sand and broken shell.
- Sand and broken shell.

11
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,536
What is it?

12
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,452
Um...

13
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,055
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

14
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,097
What was it? A sail?

15
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:07,492
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

16
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,657
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

17
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,617
Hollom, you must make a decision.

18
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,294
We shall beat to quarters!

19
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,455
Rouse up! Rouse up!
Sleepers awake!

20
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:36,529
Move! Move along! Move along!

21
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:39,610
Jump to it, boys! Jump to it!

22
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:42,848
Light along there!

23
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,294
Sighting in heavy fog.

24
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,765
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

25
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,364
- Where away?
- Uh...

26
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:24,005
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

27
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,647
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

28
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,964
Man-of-war?

29
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,690
I don't know, sir.

30
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:40,448
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

31
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:46,403
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

32
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:52,883
Well, you did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

33
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,566
The deck's yours, Tom.

34
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,050
Sir.

35
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:04,080
Clear away! And launch boats!

36
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,449
- Quit your dawdling!
- You heard the man!

37
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,885
Lower away!

38
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,723
Haul both your yard tackles!

39
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,441
Strike the bell!

40
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,842
Down! All hands down!

41
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:13,598
Hands to your stations!
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

42
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:26,039
18-pounders. We'll have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

43
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:29,753
Mr Allen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

44
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,833
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

45
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,391
Sergeant! Take your section
into the main top.

46
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:43,316
We stand tall on the quarterdeck, son.
All of us.

47
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:47,236
- Mr Boyle, run up the colours.
- Aye, sir.

48
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,830
Note for the log, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells. "

49
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:02,675
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

50
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,070
Bill!

51
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,914
Leave the swords!
Get the captain's silver below.

52
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,880
She's not in range yet!
Stand fast till she's close enough!

53
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:15,635
- Close with him amidships!
- Midships it is, sir!

54
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,510
For God's sake, don't drop anything!

55
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,749
Steady!

56
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,229
- Hold your positions!
- Hold your position! Courage, now!

57
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,471
- Hold steady, boys!
- Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet!

58
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,756
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

59
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,430
Aye, sir.

60
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:41,952
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

61
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,677
Clear the forward pin rails!

62
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,395
More sand on the floor!

63
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,908
On the up-roll... fire!

64
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:09,988
Down!

65
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:22,952
Relieving-tackles on the tiller!
You men, collect these wounded!

66
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:29,869
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell!

67
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,147
Sir! To the taffrail!

68
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,389
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer, sir.

69
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,666
We're fish in a barrel.

70
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,860
Why are we not firing?

71
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,583
Let me through.

72
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,059
Here, Joe! Here!

73
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,141
Hold it in there!

74
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:37,219
- He's on the larboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms!

75
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:42,577
Prepare to repel boarders.

76
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,705
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

77
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,938
Your orders, sir?

78
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:55,065
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

79
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,615
Put us in that fog, Tom.

80
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,580
Pull together, men!

81
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,702
Pull for the fog bank!

82
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,460
Run 'em out! Run 'em out!

83
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,257
Fire!

84
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:27,384
She's opened up a seam!
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

85
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:30,104
Joe, a mallet and some irons!

86
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,900
She's gaining on us.

87
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:48,497
- We're nearly there, boys!
- Pull! Pull!

88
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,655
- Reach for it, men!
- We're home inside that fog!

89
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,496
Fire!

90
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,820
Pull for Lucky Jack!

91
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:03,972
We've done it!

92
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:08,940
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

93
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:21,452
They'll not find us in here!

94
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,010
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

95
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,974
Avast rowing.

96
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,086
Well done, lads.

97
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:25,332
Two feet six inches, sir... and holding.

98
00:14:28,815 --> 00:14:31,454
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

99
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:43,644
So, what's the butcher's bill?

100
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,202
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

101
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,492
Joe Plaice.

102
00:14:56,573 --> 00:15:01,726
He has a severely depressed fracture of
the skull. I don't think he'll see out the night.

103
00:15:01,772 --> 00:15:04,445
Lord Blakeney.

104
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,927
Just a broken arm, sir.

105
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,005
Well, you're in very good hands.

106
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:20,967
I’m doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

107
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:25,249
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however...

108
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,686
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

109
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,567
What?

110
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,087
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

111
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:43,084
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

112
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,319
Damn fine gunnery.

113
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:50,719
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

114
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:55,359
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

115
00:15:56,368 --> 00:16:01,965
I have no idea what it is you're talking about,
but he did seem to come off rather well.

116
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:07,921
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

117
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:10,123
Hm.

118
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:14,200
Well, the French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

119
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,603
Indeed.

120
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:23,602
If he knew we were looking for him, he could
have stood to sea and passed well clear.

121
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,723
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

122
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,277
If she was a frigate, then I am a Dutchman!

123
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:57,196
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonour in it.

124
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,433
She was more like a ship of the line.

125
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:02,720
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

126
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:05,316
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

127
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,997
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

128
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:11,550
What is the weather gauge?

129
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:15,032
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth!

130
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:21,000
It means she had the wind in her favour,
therefore control of the engagement.

131
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,278
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

132
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:27,876
The simple fact is we were soundly beaten.

133
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,115
- Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific...
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favour.

134
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,509
By comparison, the Surprise
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

135
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,675
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

136
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,956
The Surprise is not old.
No one would call her old.

137
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,954
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.
She's a fine sea boat, weatherly, stiff and fast.

138
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:01,269
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

139
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,394
No, she's not old.

140
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,594
She's in her prime.

141
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:11,068
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

142
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,070
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

143
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:17,876
We're not going home.

144
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:30,429
But to refit we need a port,
and the Acheron may be still looking for us.

145
00:18:30,516 --> 00:18:34,667
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

146
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:40,386
As you said, Mr Allen, she is taking the war to
the South Seas. We are supposed to stop her.

147
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:47,425
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

148
00:18:48,314 --> 00:18:51,863
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

149
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:55,469
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

150
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,189
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?

151
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:18,263
What do you mean?

152
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:24,425
Joe said when you die, they stitch you in your
hammock with the last stitch in your nose,

153
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,543
just to make sure you're not asleep.

154
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:34,340
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

155
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:33,018
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.

156
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,896
I've never seen a braver patient.

157
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:16,421
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

158
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,379
I want good work now.

159
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:22,774
I'll need two men into the starboard
fore channels. Roberts, Chadwick.

160
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:24,853
That's nice work there.

161
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:28,092
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

162
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,738
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

163
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:42,211
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

164
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,097
He's known this ship man and boy.

165
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,174
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

166
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,332
I do understand your point, Mr Allen.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

167
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:58,618
However, a week in the Brazilian rainforest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

168
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,849
The Acheron will be halfway to China.

169
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:06,456
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best. Which
is all I can hope to expect from any man.

170
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,813
Is them his brains?

171
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:44,570
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

172
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,932
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

173
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:56,051
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

174
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:03,213
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.

175
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,364
And he knows his birds and beasts.

176
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:08,684
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

177
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:12,163
Back to work, you loafers!
Eckhart, use your pipe.

178
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:14,562
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

179
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:18,281
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here!

180
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,080
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

181
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,169
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

182
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,242
Much better, thank you, sir.

183
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,322
Well, good. Good.

184
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:45,089
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I...

185
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,446
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

186
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,360
Thank you, sir.

187
00:23:57,529 --> 00:23:59,997
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

188
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:03,638
I had the honour of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

189
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:09,564
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I’m not mistaken.

190
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,725
Yes.

191
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:22,116
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

192
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,158
You should read the book.

193
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,715
I will, sir. Thank you.

194
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:53,480
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

195
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:57,319
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

196
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:08,556
How about this?

197
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:12,921
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

198
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,347
Salute.

199
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:27,268
Hats off.

200
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,427
What's all this about?

201
00:26:34,077 --> 00:26:37,273
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

202
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:40,985
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the Acheron, sir.

203
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:43,874
You see, Will here, he seen her being built.

204
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:48,905
In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

205
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:52,749
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

206
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:54,985
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

207
00:26:55,075 --> 00:27:00,103
Sir, I saw there was something right strange
about her, so I asked Joe...

208
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:03,345
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

209
00:27:03,434 --> 00:27:07,985
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

210
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:10,542
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.

211
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:13,751
Killick, an extra ration of rum for these men.

212
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,142
Thank you very much, sir.

213
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:19,111
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'll drink wine.

214
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:21,229
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day...

215
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:23,907
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

216
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:29,151
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

217
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,746
Heavier, but fast despite it.

218
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:37,906
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.

219
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:41,660
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

220
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:46,506
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

221
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:50,348
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

222
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,263
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

223
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:59,141
Even if we did catch up with her...
I mean, to take her...

224
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,189
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

225
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:08,987
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.

226
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:25,060
Hello, darling! How much for a kiss?

227
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,744
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?

228
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:30,899
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

229
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:34,138
Give us arrows. I give axe. Quick, mate.

230
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,377
Thank you, mate.

231
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,464
Gangway for the mail, please.

232
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:51,822
- Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.
- Era um navio francês.

233
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:55,056
- What's he saying?
- Estava indo pela costa?

234
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:58,421
Sim, estava. Indo pela costa ao sul.

235
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:02,180
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

236
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:04,654
- Muito grande.
- Obrigado, senhor.

237
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,456
Somewhere here.

238
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:12,012
A full three weeks ahead.

239
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:13,901
Damn.

240
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:17,457
All right, Tom, let's get all this squared away.

241
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:21,297
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar!
Let us complete our business here.

242
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:24,022
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor!

243
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:32,819
Put that woman down, Slade! This is a ship
of His Majesty's Navy, not a floating bordello!

244
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:39,336
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

245
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:52,979
Well done.

246
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:55,052
Gentlemen...

247
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,810
- To wives and to sweethearts.
- To wives and sweethearts.

248
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,131
May they never meet.

249
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,974
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

250
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,769
Sir?

251
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,970
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

252
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:20,769
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

253
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:24,294
And Mr Pullings... Mr Pullings
was a snivelling midshipman,

254
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:26,653
still yearning for hearth and home.

255
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:29,775
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?

256
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:32,850
I have had the honour
of dining with him twice.

257
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:35,690
He spoke to me on both occasions.

258
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:38,814
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

259
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:43,925
He always said in battle... "Never mind
the manoeuvres, just go straight at 'em. "

260
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:48,009
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

261
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,008
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

262
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:54,327
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

263
00:30:57,176 --> 00:31:00,133
The first time that he spoke to me...

264
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:05,209
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

265
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:08,890
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,

266
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:13,445
and he said "Aubrey...
may I trouble you for the salt?"

267
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:20,363
I’ve always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

268
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:31,087
The second time...
The second time he told me a story...

269
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,563
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

270
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:39,328
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

271
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:43,883
His zeal for king and country kept him warm.

272
00:31:43,972 --> 00:31:47,760
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

273
00:31:47,852 --> 00:31:53,005
you'd cry out "Oh, what pitiful stuff'
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

274
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:55,082
But with Nelson...

275
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:59,610
you felt your heart glow.

276
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,445
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

277
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:17,198
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

278
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:20,486
- To Lord Nelson.
- To Lord Nelson.

279
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:22,719
To Lord Nelson.

280
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,319
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

281
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:28,887
I do.

282
00:32:28,968 --> 00:32:31,198
Which would you choose?

283
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:37,839
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

284
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:40,236
If you had to choose.

285
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:43,637
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other...

286
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:47,197
Well then, if you're going to push me...

287
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:52,284
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

288
00:32:52,366 --> 00:32:55,961
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.

289
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:59,243
There, I have you!
You're completely dished.

290
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:05,002
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?

291
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:14,681
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

292
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:18,274
Really! Weevils!

293
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:23,438
- To the lesser of two weevils.
- To the lesser of two weevils!

294
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:36,516
Yay, Joe!

295
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:40,953
Go on, Joe!

296
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,036
The Lord taketh...

297
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,998
and the Lord giveth away.

298
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,833
You hear that? He said something!

299
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,673
Doctor! He spoke, Doctor!

300
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,591
Well done indeed, Stephen.

301
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,558
Adieu to you Spanish ladies

302
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,598
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain

303
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,389
For we've received orders
to sail for old England

304
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:30,394
We hope in a short time
to see you again

305
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:35,231
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

306
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:37,752
Indeed.

307
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:41,432
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

308
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,906
A warning take by me

309
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:48,309
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

310
00:34:59,676 --> 00:35:02,668
On deck there! Sail ho!

311
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:05,712
Looks like a frigate!

312
00:35:10,115 --> 00:35:12,151
How did it get there?

313
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,750
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

314
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:18,986
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

315
00:35:22,794 --> 00:35:26,184
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

316
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:28,185
Run like smoke and oakum.

317
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:32,027
- We'll have to bend every sail.
- We'll put up our handkerchiefs if we have to!

318
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:35,901
We must survive this day.
Let's get about it. Mr Allen, gentlemen.

319
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,949
All hands, make sail!

320
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:42,743
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

321
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:03,509
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

322
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,900
You better hold fast.

323
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,980
What is it with this man?

324
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:19,622
Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?
His boy, God forbid?

325
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,665
He fights like you, Jack.

326
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:42,306
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

327
00:36:42,388 --> 00:36:46,426
When its lower limb is touching the horizon...
Williamson, look to your sextant!

328
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:50,216
When the orb is no longer rising...

329
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:53,743
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

330
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,102
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

331
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:58,303
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

332
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,775
Call noon. It's your class.

333
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:06,217
- Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

334
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:08,536
Six hours?

335
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,776
Five at most.

336
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:14,653
Just keep us out of her reach until nightfall.

337
00:37:22,465 --> 00:37:27,174
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

338
00:37:27,264 --> 00:37:30,574
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

339
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:36,499
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

340
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,458
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

341
00:37:44,543 --> 00:37:47,341
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

342
00:37:47,423 --> 00:37:49,617
Fend her off, fend her off.

343
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:52,091
Lower away on the main.

344
00:37:58,782 --> 00:38:01,818
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

345
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:17,773
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

346
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,978
Lively now.
We've not ten minutes before he's up with us.

347
00:38:27,899 --> 00:38:31,574
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

348
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:55,166
Now.

349
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:03,414
Killick there! Douse your light.

350
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,134
Mr Allen, make ready.

351
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:52,961
Hello. We caught a fish.

352
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:56,283
Take the helm, Bonden.

353
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:59,921
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,206
Hard a’ larboard!

355
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,241
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I’ll take this watch.

356
00:40:36,329 --> 00:40:37,887
Aye, sir.

357
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:42,360
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

358
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:44,404
Well done, sir.

359
00:40:46,168 --> 00:40:50,559
She's a right phantom, she is. The way
she come up again, right behind us like that.

360
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:55,801
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

361
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:58,236
With our shot bouncin' off her.

362
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:01,160
Captain's not called Lucky Jack for no reason.

363
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:05,160
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

364
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:08,044
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

365
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:12,883
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

366
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:17,323
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

367
00:41:17,406 --> 00:41:20,078
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

368
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:22,759
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

369
00:41:22,805 --> 00:41:26,320
They go after rich merchantmen and the like.

370
00:41:26,405 --> 00:41:30,000
Hey, but think on our share
of the prize money.

371
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:34,874
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

372
00:41:34,964 --> 00:41:38,320
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

373
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:40,634
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

374
00:41:40,724 --> 00:41:44,512
And I’ve never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.

375
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:51,713
Sitting up all night, catching your death
of cold. That's the last of the coffee, too.

376
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,794
Thank you, Killick.

377
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,918
Bonden.

378
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:03,039
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'- sou'west.

379
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:06,956
Aye, sir. Sou'- sou'west.

380
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:13,196
Sail!

381
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,353
Two points off starboard bow!

382
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:19,236
Three cheers for Lucky Jack!

383
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:23,996
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

384
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,395
She's ours, boys!

385
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:40,752
- Foul! You got away before me.

386
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:47,591
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

387
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:50,067
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

388
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:52,035
I’ve never seen the like.

389
00:42:52,118 --> 00:42:55,906
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

390
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:59,990
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

391
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,274
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.

392
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:06,713
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favours us this time.

393
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:09,948
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

394
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:14,746
Still, if we can close this gap
and get up behind her, she may well be ours.

395
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:17,111
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

396
00:43:17,716 --> 00:43:21,026
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

397
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:37,632
Turn!

398
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:41,389
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up!

399
00:43:41,474 --> 00:43:43,510
Hold!

400
00:43:44,274 --> 00:43:47,710
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

401
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:52,264
I want more. Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

402
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:55,504
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

403
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,630
All hands on starboard rail!

404
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:03,503
Come up the larboard topsail sheets!

405
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:24,709
- We're crackin' on!
- We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it!

406
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:29,227
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

407
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,227
- Arh!
- Mr Hollar!

408
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,461
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft!

409
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,187
No lounging, boy!

410
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:44,741
Lifelines, fore and aft!
Double-grape that launch!

411
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:49,178
Cape Horn, Doctor.

412
00:45:04,347 --> 00:45:07,225
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.

413
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:09,104
Thank you for that, Davies.

414
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:13,863
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

415
00:45:13,947 --> 00:45:16,301
I reckon he'd follow him to the gates of hell.

416
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:20,743
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

417
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:26,739
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

418
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:29,658
I’ll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

419
00:45:29,745 --> 00:45:32,657
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.

420
00:45:32,745 --> 00:45:38,741
Sail trimmers to their stations!
Get the sails off her, lads. She's over-pressed.

421
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:40,895
Give 'em a pull and belay!

422
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:59,099
We're closing on her, Tom.
I’ll not give up now.

423
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:02,300
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

424
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:04,897
Sou'west by west, sir.

425
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:07,660
Mr Calamy.

426
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:10,336
Idlers and waisters below.

427
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:16,655
We're for the Horn, boys!

428
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:22,338
Close reef topsails!

429
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,972
Lively, lads!

430
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,695
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom!

431
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,571
Johansson, Truelove! To the mizzen!

432
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:00,769
All secure.

433
00:47:00,858 --> 00:47:02,735
Down ye go, lads.

434
00:47:08,937 --> 00:47:13,453
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

435
00:47:16,777 --> 00:47:20,008
- I’ll need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

436
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:31,565
Mr Hollom, sir! Help me!

437
00:47:38,095 --> 00:47:41,610
Tudor, Ellers! To Mr Allen!

438
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:46,484
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along!

439
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,085
Help!

440
00:47:59,013 --> 00:48:00,969
Help me!

441
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:09,252
Man overboard!

442
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:14,684
Mizzen's gone! Hands to the taffrail!

443
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:28,084
He's over there, sir!

444
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,686
Swim for the wreckage, man!
Swim, man!

445
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,089
Over here!

446
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:39,244
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

447
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:43,289
She's broaching! We're losing her!

448
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,567
Sir, the wreckage is acting as a sea anchor!

449
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,039
We must cut it loose!
It's going to sink us!

450
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:53,804
Sir, he's going to make it! He can do it!

451
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,768
- Come on, Will!
- Come on! Hand over hand!

452
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:02,797
For God's sake, Will, swim!
Swim for the wreckage, Will!

453
00:49:11,088 --> 00:49:12,918
You can do it, Will!

454
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:17,000
- Swim! Come on!
- Come on, Will! Swim!

455
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:43,791
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

456
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,548
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

457
00:51:56,554 --> 00:52:00,832
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

458
00:52:01,514 --> 00:52:08,271
For my own part, those who die under my
knife, or from some subsequent infection...

459
00:52:08,353 --> 00:52:14,030
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

460
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:18,627
That young man was a casualty of war.

461
00:52:21,232 --> 00:52:25,305
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

462
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,383
Weevils.

463
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:34,903
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

464
00:52:34,991 --> 00:52:38,904
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

465
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,782
Jack, before answering,
I’m compelled to ask,

466
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,829
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

467
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,339
To the captain I’d say
there's little I detest more than an informer.

468
00:52:57,429 --> 00:53:00,546
- Now you're talking like an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

469
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:02,585
Well, as a friend, then.

470
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:08,266
As a friend, I would say that I have never once
doubted your abilities as a captain.

471
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:10,179
Speak plainly, Stephen.

472
00:53:11,908 --> 00:53:16,424
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

473
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:20,217
The men... of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

474
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:22,457
rightfully confident of victory.

475
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:27,940
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

476
00:53:29,427 --> 00:53:35,376
And chasing this larger, faster ship with
its long guns is beginning to smack of pride.

477
00:53:35,466 --> 00:53:38,742
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

478
00:53:38,826 --> 00:53:41,181
Duty. Yes, I’ve heard it well spoken of.

479
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:45,703
Be as satiric as you like. Viewing the world
through a microscope is your prerogative.

480
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:50,142
This is a ship of war. I will grind whatever
grist the mill requires to fulfil my duty.

481
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:52,500
Whatever the cost?

482
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:54,735
Whatever the cost.

483
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:57,498
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

484
00:53:57,585 --> 00:54:01,702
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

485
00:54:01,784 --> 00:54:04,173
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

486
00:54:04,264 --> 00:54:10,294
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

487
00:54:12,423 --> 00:54:14,414
Got it.

488
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:20,701
The wind's backing, sir.

489
00:54:20,783 --> 00:54:24,661
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.

490
00:54:25,222 --> 00:54:31,013
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

491
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,980
How far south, sir?

492
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,451
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

493
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,896
- Aye, sir.
- Lively!

494
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:44,934
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

495
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:50,417
Heave! Steady!

496
00:55:18,338 --> 00:55:19,657
Ahh...

497
00:55:20,218 --> 00:55:22,812
Hurray!

498
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:28,409
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.

499
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:32,809
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

500
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,888
- To the sun.
- To the sun!

501
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,886
Oh, and by way of anticipation of this event,

502
00:55:40,976 --> 00:55:46,369
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

503
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:50,573
- Killick! Killick there...
- I’m already here, ain't I?

504
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:57,014
Gentlemen, I give you...

505
00:55:57,775 --> 00:55:59,970
our destination.

506
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:09,609
- It's the Galápagos Islands!
- The Galápagos Islands!

507
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:14,289
Our whaling fleet is there.

508
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:19,606
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

509
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:25,165
That's where the Acheron will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

510
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,846
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me...

511
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:30,770
a slice of Albemarle.

512
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:35,162
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

513
00:56:35,252 --> 00:56:36,526
Perfect.

514
00:56:36,612 --> 00:56:39,251
And the Acheron... for me.

515
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:55,045
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

516
00:56:55,130 --> 00:57:01,126
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

517
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:06,363
Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!

518
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:11,608
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

519
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:17,127
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission

520
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:23,317
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

521
00:57:23,408 --> 00:57:30,358
Don't forget your old shipmates
Folly-rolly-rolly-rolly-rye-o!

522
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,763
Las Encantadas.

523
00:58:12,844 --> 00:58:19,397
The Enchanted Isles. They're said
to be full of strange and wonderful beasts.

524
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:23,161
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.

525
00:58:23,243 --> 00:58:27,031
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -

526
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:31,355
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

527
00:58:31,443 --> 00:58:35,754
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I’ll wager.

528
00:58:35,842 --> 00:58:39,073
Well, I would like that of all things.

529
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:45,678
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

530
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:52,071
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.

531
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:55,116
Yes, that's the whole point.

532
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,988
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

533
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,311
See, there's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

534
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:14,396
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

535
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,955
Did God make them change?

536
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:21,270
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

537
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,668
But do they also change themselves?

538
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:27,431
Now that is a question, isn't it?

539
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:32,032
Sir! Sir, we've raised the Galápagos!

540
00:59:32,078 --> 00:59:34,069
I’m coming!

541
01:00:07,515 --> 01:00:11,144
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Oh, yes, I see.

542
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:14,749
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

543
01:00:14,834 --> 01:00:20,067
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting! It's got warts all over it.

544
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:22,987
Ugly devils, aren't they?

545
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:26,507
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.

546
01:00:26,553 --> 01:00:29,351
What, no women? It ain't natural.

547
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:32,430
How extraordinary.

548
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:34,265
What is, sir?

549
01:00:34,353 --> 01:00:38,231
Those birds. They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

550
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,906
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

551
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:44,388
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

552
01:00:44,472 --> 01:00:48,101
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

553
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:52,989
No. They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

554
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:56,029
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

555
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,183
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

556
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:02,819
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

557
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,060
These ones do.

558
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:15,785
Well, I’ll be damned.

559
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:21,865
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

560
01:01:44,307 --> 01:01:49,062
All hands about ship! Off tacks and sheets!
Prepare the mainsail to haul!

561
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:01,382
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the Albatross.

562
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:04,775
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

563
01:02:05,745 --> 01:02:08,578
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

564
01:02:08,665 --> 01:02:11,975
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms!

565
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:15,737
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.

566
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:21,057
Hid in that inlet yonder. Burnt our bloody
ship to the waterline. Fucking pirates!

567
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:23,339
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

568
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:27,383
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

569
01:02:27,464 --> 01:02:32,457
£12,000 sterling of the finest grade oil they
took. We been out more than two years, see.

570
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,374
And her course?

571
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:37,500
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

572
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:40,655
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

573
01:02:40,742 --> 01:02:43,814
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

574
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:46,052
All hands, make sail!

575
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:49,054
Sir, should we not take on fresh provisions?

576
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,134
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

577
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:11,495
- Jack, have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

578
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,652
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

579
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,049
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

580
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:22,018
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

581
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:25,091
As I understand it, this is a long, thin island.

582
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:28,569
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

583
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:32,412
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

584
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:36,286
I could walk briskly, pausing only
for important measurements.

585
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:40,371
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

586
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:44,370
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

587
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:47,529
They're not. I’m obliged to say no.

588
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:52,686
Oh, I see.
So after all this time in your service,

589
01:03:52,777 --> 01:03:57,452
I must simply content myself
to form part of this belligerent expedition,

590
01:03:57,536 --> 01:04:02,326
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power...

591
01:04:02,416 --> 01:04:05,852
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack, no.

592
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:10,053
You've forgotten yourself. For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

593
01:04:10,135 --> 01:04:14,287
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht!

594
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:18,334
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir!

595
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,487
All right. All right.

596
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:54,730
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

597
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,928
Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

598
01:04:58,011 --> 01:04:59,603
Mr Blakeney.

599
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:03,730
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

600
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:09,530
I think it's a Galápagos beetle.

601
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:12,202
I’m sure of it.

602
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:18,324
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

603
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,606
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

604
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:26,638
You can have it, sir.

605
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:44,836
Mr Blakeney.

606
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,885
- Thank you.
- Sir.

607
01:06:01,806 --> 01:06:03,717
Last gun fired, sir.

608
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:07,276
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

609
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:12,519
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

610
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:15,637
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- No!

611
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:18,797
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No!

612
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:21,524
- Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?
- No!

613
01:06:21,605 --> 01:06:24,676
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery!

614
01:06:27,644 --> 01:06:30,795
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

615
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,561
- Mark your targets!
- Come on, lads, faster now!

616
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,634
Come on, swab it!

617
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:52,271
Heave!

618
01:06:52,362 --> 01:06:55,434
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

619
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:58,275
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

620
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:32,875
One minute and ten seconds!

621
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:34,551
Huzzah!

622
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,233
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

623
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:39,314
Huzzah!

624
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:43,513
Gangway for the captain, lads.

625
01:07:43,598 --> 01:07:46,192
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

626
01:07:46,238 --> 01:07:48,229
Thank you, sir.

627
01:07:54,357 --> 01:07:59,556
Killick! Killick there!
What do you have for us tonight?

628
01:07:59,637 --> 01:08:02,071
- Which it's soused hog's face.
- Eh?

629
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:06,627
- Which it is soused hog's face!
- My favourite. My favourite.

630
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:13,030
And when they run,
the Surprise will blow her to kingdom come!

631
01:09:07,111 --> 01:09:10,342
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

632
01:09:10,431 --> 01:09:12,501
I can't make it rain.

633
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:17,701
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

634
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,258
I have never known such a run of bad luck.

635
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:41,706
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

636
01:09:45,388 --> 01:09:47,618
Where'd that come from?

637
01:09:48,508 --> 01:09:53,218
It's from the Bible, that. That is
from the Bible. The story of the Jonah.

638
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:57,016
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

639
01:09:57,107 --> 01:10:00,019
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

640
01:10:00,107 --> 01:10:05,500
Evil comes... from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

641
01:10:05,587 --> 01:10:10,102
- No, no. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

642
01:10:10,946 --> 01:10:14,461
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

643
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:30,904
It's like Killick says. Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

644
01:10:30,985 --> 01:10:35,421
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

645
01:10:35,504 --> 01:10:39,133
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

646
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:03,096
You there! Stand fast!

647
01:11:05,142 --> 01:11:09,135
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

648
01:11:09,222 --> 01:11:12,611
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

649
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,339
Aye, sir.

650
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:18,898
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

651
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,891
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

652
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,778
I intended to, sir, but the right words didn't...

653
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,854
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

654
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,897
I’ve tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

655
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:40,289
but they've taken a set against me.

656
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:45,569
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

657
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:48,456
I’ll set that to rights.
I’ll be much tougher on them.

658
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,928
You don't make friends
with the foremast jacks, lad.

659
01:11:52,018 --> 01:11:56,136
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

660
01:11:56,218 --> 01:11:59,767
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

661
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,052
I’m very sorry, sir.

662
01:12:02,137 --> 01:12:05,413
- You're, what? 26, 27?
- I’m 30 next Friday, sir.

663
01:12:05,497 --> 01:12:07,010
30?

664
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:10,214
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

665
01:12:10,297 --> 01:12:14,972
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

666
01:12:15,056 --> 01:12:18,526
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

667
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:23,292
Look, Hollom, it's leadership they want.

668
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:25,331
Strength.

669
01:12:25,415 --> 01:12:30,648
Now, you find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

670
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:35,611
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

671
01:12:36,655 --> 01:12:39,327
Yes, sir. Um...

672
01:12:39,414 --> 01:12:44,283
Strength, respect... and discipline, sir.

673
01:12:48,054 --> 01:12:51,841
Well... it's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

674
01:12:52,813 --> 01:12:55,532
Damned unfortunate.

675
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:59,006
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

676
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:04,965
- I am not a flogging captain.
- Hollom is a scapegoat

677
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:09,204
for all the bad luck,
real or imagined, on this voyage.

678
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:11,726
Mr Lamb? If you please.

679
01:13:11,812 --> 01:13:14,928
They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

680
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:17,764
You've pushed them too hard.

681
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:21,366
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

682
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:25,569
Not to criticise nor to comment
on my command.

683
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,963
Well, shall I leave you until
you're in a more harmonious frame of mind?

684
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:35,799
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

685
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:39,200
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

686
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:42,440
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

687
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:45,566
I’d rather have them three sheets to the wind
than face a mutiny.

688
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:47,844
I’m rather understanding of mutinies.

689
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:52,558
Men pressed from their homes, confined
for months aboard a wooden prison...

690
01:13:52,648 --> 01:13:59,167
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

691
01:14:00,528 --> 01:14:04,645
I hate it when you talk of the service
in this way. It makes me so very low.

692
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,399
You think I want to flog Nagle?

693
01:14:06,487 --> 01:14:09,923
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

694
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:12,760
Under my orders?

695
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:16,999
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work...

696
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:19,395
Jack, the man failed to salute.

697
01:14:19,486 --> 01:14:22,080
There's hierarchies even in nature.

698
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:27,194
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no...
- Men must be governed!

699
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:29,719
Often not wisely, but governed nonetheless.

700
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:33,923
That's the excuse of every tyrant in history,
from Nero to Bonaparte.

701
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:37,964
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

702
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:42,322
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

703
01:14:45,044 --> 01:14:46,796
Four.

704
01:14:48,204 --> 01:14:49,523
Five.

705
01:14:51,724 --> 01:14:53,316
Six.

706
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,241
Seven.

707
01:14:57,443 --> 01:14:58,922
Eight.

708
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:01,275
Nine.

709
01:15:03,563 --> 01:15:05,360
Ten.

710
01:15:06,403 --> 01:15:07,551
Eleven.

711
01:15:09,522 --> 01:15:11,399
Twelve.

712
01:15:14,282 --> 01:15:16,398
Cut him down.

713
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,635
Shh. Not so loud.

714
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:36,149
Oh, put that dirk down, Boyle.

715
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,983
- You OK, Mr Hollom?

716
01:16:41,075 --> 01:16:44,033
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up!

717
01:16:44,115 --> 01:16:47,072
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

718
01:16:47,154 --> 01:16:50,032
- Have some water.
- Oh, thank you.

719
01:16:54,074 --> 01:16:56,304
Sir. Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

720
01:17:03,153 --> 01:17:08,864
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

721
01:17:10,553 --> 01:17:14,101
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

722
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:17,710
My God. You believe it too.

723
01:17:19,312 --> 01:17:22,622
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

724
01:17:28,871 --> 01:17:30,702
It's him, innit?

725
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:36,068
The Jonah.

726
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,061
He's causing it.

727
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:43,587
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

728
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:48,141
Every time he's on watch, that ship appears.

729
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:54,063
You wait and see.

730
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:58,899
Any time tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

731
01:18:00,029 --> 01:18:04,624
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

732
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:26,696
Mr Hollom.

733
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:29,380
You gave me such a start.

734
01:18:31,746 --> 01:18:33,816
Are you feeling better now?

735
01:18:33,906 --> 01:18:37,296
Yes. Much better, thank you.

736
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:52,342
The captain thinks
we'll get our wind tomorrow.

737
01:18:52,424 --> 01:18:54,415
I’m sure of it.

738
01:19:22,182 --> 01:19:25,572
You've always been very kind to me.

739
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:34,690
Goodbye, Blakeney.

740
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:44,771
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

741
01:20:44,855 --> 01:20:47,688
But we are all God's creatures.

742
01:20:50,335 --> 01:20:54,487
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

743
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:57,968
or spoke ill of him,

744
01:20:59,614 --> 01:21:03,084
or failed him in respect of fellowship...

745
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:07,683
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

746
01:21:07,773 --> 01:21:09,843
And we ask for his.

747
01:21:24,972 --> 01:21:27,440
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

748
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:54,125
Avast there!

749
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:10,280
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

750
01:22:10,368 --> 01:22:17,046
Some sort of albatross. Either that, or
he's a prodigious great mew. There it goes.

751
01:22:23,127 --> 01:22:26,881
There he is. My bird, my bird. Damn!

752
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:30,357
- It's circling, lads!

753
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:38,195
Doctor?

754
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,516
My God! Doctor! Doctor!

755
01:22:41,886 --> 01:22:46,516
I’m so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

756
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:52,242
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I’m fine, Jack.

757
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:07,877
The bullet took in a piece of shirt with it.

758
01:23:07,964 --> 01:23:12,798
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

759
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:14,760
Are you equal to the task?

760
01:23:14,843 --> 01:23:20,679
Well, I’ll need to read up on the doctor's
books, like. Study some pictures he has.

761
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:22,594
Study some pictures?

762
01:23:22,683 --> 01:23:25,640
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

763
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:32,070
Well, it'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You know, you wouldn't have the...

764
01:23:32,162 --> 01:23:34,551
I’ll manage. You'll see.

765
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,548
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

766
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,832
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

767
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:10,510
Better get...

768
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:13,830
Goodbye, sir.

769
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:35,270
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

770
01:24:42,516 --> 01:24:45,553
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

771
01:25:22,393 --> 01:25:24,782
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

772
01:25:24,873 --> 01:25:29,787
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

773
01:25:31,432 --> 01:25:33,741
Gently there.

774
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:43,860
Briskly now. Secure this line.

775
01:25:43,951 --> 01:25:47,102
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

776
01:25:57,710 --> 01:26:00,178
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

777
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:02,579
No.

778
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:06,027
I do this with my own hand.

779
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:14,227
If everything is under control,
I’ll just be outside.

780
01:26:14,309 --> 01:26:17,267
A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

781
01:26:17,349 --> 01:26:22,627
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

782
01:26:22,988 --> 01:26:30,576
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

783
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:33,177
Well, good, then.

784
01:26:33,267 --> 01:26:35,701
Put your hand on my belly,

785
01:26:35,787 --> 01:26:38,142
pressing firmly when I give the word.

786
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:41,537
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

787
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:50,856
Padeen, please.

788
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:05,974
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

789
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,295
Swab.

790
01:27:18,944 --> 01:27:20,934
All right.

791
01:27:23,743 --> 01:27:26,860
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

792
01:27:29,543 --> 01:27:33,615
Take a good grip... with the square retractor.

793
01:27:36,942 --> 01:27:39,058
Right in.

794
01:27:39,142 --> 01:27:41,019
And lift up.

795
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:42,501
Lift up.

796
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,529
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

797
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,652
Are you all right?

798
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:16,210
I got it.

799
01:28:27,378 --> 01:28:29,573
A tad more pressure.

800
01:28:39,977 --> 01:28:42,571
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

801
01:28:43,257 --> 01:28:45,373
She'll patch up nicely.

802
01:28:45,457 --> 01:28:47,288
Thank God I got it.

803
01:29:31,213 --> 01:29:32,965
Oh, that's good.

804
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,010
Sir! Sir!

805
01:29:42,092 --> 01:29:45,767
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

806
01:29:45,852 --> 01:29:49,322
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

807
01:29:49,412 --> 01:29:51,766
Padeen, that one's got away.

808
01:29:51,851 --> 01:29:55,924
Sir, I’ve made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

809
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:15,168
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

810
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:21,848
Well, sir, perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of... fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

811
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:27,165
They don't combine too well, I find.

812
01:30:27,248 --> 01:30:28,237
Right.

813
01:30:28,328 --> 01:30:30,603
Should you really be getting up, sir?

814
01:30:30,688 --> 01:30:33,998
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

815
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:37,364
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

816
01:30:43,567 --> 01:30:47,799
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

817
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:51,961
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

818
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:55,925
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

819
01:30:56,006 --> 01:30:58,804
I’m not even sure
it was the Acheron we sighted.

820
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:03,721
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

821
01:31:03,806 --> 01:31:08,720
No, we shall head home. Before peace
breaks out with France, God forbid.

822
01:31:12,205 --> 01:31:15,481
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

823
01:31:15,565 --> 01:31:20,558
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

824
01:31:20,644 --> 01:31:25,115
A shrub? Nonsense.
I’ll name a great tortoise after you.

825
01:31:25,204 --> 01:31:27,877
Testudo aubreii.

826
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,037
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

827
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,192
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

828
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,558
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

829
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,517
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

830
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:23,430
Come on.

831
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:36,751
Seven inches in length.

832
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,674
Four inches wide.

833
01:32:39,758 --> 01:32:42,147
15-inches-long neck.

834
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:47,349
Width at the widest point... six inches.

835
01:32:53,157 --> 01:32:56,546
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

836
01:32:56,636 --> 01:32:58,786
Here's a good one.

837
01:33:00,476 --> 01:33:03,115
Pick them up carefully.

838
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:06,469
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

839
01:33:06,556 --> 01:33:11,834
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

840
01:33:11,915 --> 01:33:14,509
And should it indeed prove flightless,

841
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:18,230
you can join me at the Royal Society dinner
as co-discoverer.

842
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,027
Mr Blakeney.

843
01:34:54,547 --> 01:34:56,742
Sir, we must hurry.

844
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:04,338
Padeen, you must carry him. Put those down.
Leave them. Just put everything down.

845
01:35:07,706 --> 01:35:10,345
Open the cages.

846
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:28,860
- All hands, unmoor ship!
- Mr Allen, I’ll have her on a starboard tack.

847
01:35:28,944 --> 01:35:32,016
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

848
01:35:32,104 --> 01:35:36,017
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

849
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:41,254
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

850
01:35:41,343 --> 01:35:44,892
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.

851
01:35:44,983 --> 01:35:51,854
If we caught up with her, I mean, to take her...
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

852
01:35:53,022 --> 01:35:55,855
Brace the yards to starboard!

853
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:07,733
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

854
01:36:07,821 --> 01:36:11,655
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

855
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:15,174
No, my greatest discovery
was your phantom.

856
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:20,095
Indeed it was. I’m sorry you had to leave
the majority of your collection behind.

857
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:25,937
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one... very interesting find.

858
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,613
Is that right?

859
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:30,809
Let me guess. A stick?

860
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:39,650
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

861
01:36:39,739 --> 01:36:42,969
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

862
01:36:43,058 --> 01:36:49,293
It's an insect that disguises itself as a stick
in order to confuse its predators.

863
01:37:39,454 --> 01:37:41,604
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

864
01:37:41,694 --> 01:37:46,483
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

865
01:37:46,573 --> 01:37:50,725
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

866
01:37:50,813 --> 01:37:55,169
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

867
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:57,163
Oh, I see.

868
01:37:57,252 --> 01:38:00,244
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

869
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:01,765
- Jack?
- Yes.

870
01:38:01,852 --> 01:38:04,571
You're the predator.

871
01:38:05,772 --> 01:38:10,640
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

872
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:12,562
That's a frigate, all right.

873
01:38:12,651 --> 01:38:15,723
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

874
01:38:15,811 --> 01:38:19,769
- Mr Allen! More smoke.
- Aye, sir!

875
01:38:19,850 --> 01:38:22,364
That'll bring 'em about.

876
01:38:32,769 --> 01:38:37,365
That's it, lads. Clean 'em up
so they fly straight and true.

877
01:38:39,809 --> 01:38:42,767
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

878
01:38:51,528 --> 01:38:56,158
Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

879
01:39:00,487 --> 01:39:02,478
Drop the gun.

880
01:39:05,567 --> 01:39:09,037
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God!

881
01:39:09,127 --> 01:39:11,924
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

882
01:39:12,006 --> 01:39:16,522
Good. Right, from now on
no "sirs", no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

883
01:39:16,606 --> 01:39:18,198
Aye, sir.

884
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:21,755
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

885
01:39:22,645 --> 01:39:25,523
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the Acheron's hold.

886
01:39:25,605 --> 01:39:28,836
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

887
01:39:28,925 --> 01:39:32,634
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

888
01:39:32,725 --> 01:39:35,397
- He may well turn the tide.
- Indeed, sir.

889
01:39:45,564 --> 01:39:47,713
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

890
01:39:47,803 --> 01:39:51,682
Make a show of fleeing, panicky
and disorganised, like a whaler might.

891
01:39:51,763 --> 01:39:54,072
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

892
01:39:54,163 --> 01:39:55,960
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

893
01:39:56,043 --> 01:40:00,115
Eckhart, leave that. Just come up quick
and get some whaler's slops on.

894
01:40:12,761 --> 01:40:16,549
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

895
01:40:16,641 --> 01:40:21,157
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

896
01:40:21,241 --> 01:40:23,550
I’m sorry, Will.

897
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:30,673
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

898
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,273
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

899
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:38,398
Mr Calamy says I’m not
on the boarding party. I wanted to say...

900
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:42,392
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

901
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:46,677
You'll lead your gun crew, then when
we board, you'll take command of the ship.

902
01:40:46,759 --> 01:40:50,956
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship... Thank you, sir.

903
01:40:51,038 --> 01:40:53,472
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

904
01:40:56,518 --> 01:40:59,590
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe!

905
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:02,191
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

906
01:41:02,277 --> 01:41:05,872
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

907
01:41:05,957 --> 01:41:09,586
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

908
01:41:09,677 --> 01:41:12,145
Make way for the captain.

909
01:41:13,477 --> 01:41:15,467
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

910
01:41:15,556 --> 01:41:17,035
Right, lads.

911
01:41:17,116 --> 01:41:19,346
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

912
01:41:19,436 --> 01:41:23,065
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

913
01:41:23,156 --> 01:41:26,591
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

914
01:41:26,675 --> 01:41:28,586
That will test our nerve.

915
01:41:28,675 --> 01:41:32,588
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

916
01:41:32,675 --> 01:41:37,874
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

917
01:41:37,955 --> 01:41:41,071
And they will sell their lives dearly.

918
01:41:42,834 --> 01:41:46,907
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

919
01:41:46,994 --> 01:41:49,588
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

920
01:41:49,634 --> 01:41:52,909
This will bring us almost to a complete stop.

921
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:56,463
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

922
01:41:56,553 --> 01:42:01,627
With the rear wheels removed you've gained
elevation, but without recoil you can't reload.

923
01:42:01,713 --> 01:42:06,786
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

924
01:42:06,872 --> 01:42:11,468
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

925
01:42:11,552 --> 01:42:19,549
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

926
01:42:20,471 --> 01:42:22,427
Captain Howard and the marines

927
01:42:22,511 --> 01:42:26,629
will sweep their weather deck with swivel gun
and musket fire from the tops.

928
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:29,622
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

929
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:34,740
They mean to take us as a prize.

930
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:41,268
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed... will be their downfall.

931
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:45,748
England is under threat of invasion.

932
01:42:45,829 --> 01:42:49,822
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

933
01:42:51,389 --> 01:42:54,141
This ship is England.

934
01:42:57,148 --> 01:43:01,505
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

935
01:43:01,588 --> 01:43:04,819
After all, surprise is on our side.

936
01:43:06,387 --> 01:43:10,505
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

937
01:43:15,867 --> 01:43:18,664
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

938
01:43:18,746 --> 01:43:20,065
Jack.

939
01:43:20,146 --> 01:43:22,296
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

940
01:43:22,386 --> 01:43:24,854
If you please, Doctor.

941
01:43:26,226 --> 01:43:29,343
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

942
01:43:29,426 --> 01:43:33,896
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

943
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:28,810
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

944
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:33,930
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

945
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:38,410
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

946
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:44,216
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.

947
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:45,891
- Barret.
- Sir.

948
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:50,575
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

949
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:53,969
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

950
01:44:54,059 --> 01:44:57,335
English whaler, this is your last warning.

951
01:44:57,419 --> 01:45:01,536
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

952
01:45:01,618 --> 01:45:03,768
- Let fly!
- Let fly!

953
01:45:05,658 --> 01:45:09,287
- Haul your yards there!
- C'est un navire de guerre!

954
01:45:10,577 --> 01:45:12,647
Run out, boys!

955
01:45:12,737 --> 01:45:13,852
Fire!

956
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:16,735
Fire!

957
01:45:25,256 --> 01:45:27,850
For the mainmast, lads!

958
01:45:34,496 --> 01:45:36,850
- Let me through.
- Fire!

959
01:45:58,934 --> 01:46:01,572
Huzzah!

960
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:05,324
Hard a-larboard!

961
01:46:06,013 --> 01:46:08,447
Right the headsails! Set the topsails!

962
01:46:08,533 --> 01:46:09,761
Heave!

963
01:46:10,813 --> 01:46:13,565
Man the starboard battery!

964
01:46:19,452 --> 01:46:21,727
Fire as she bears!

965
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:44,203
Get to it! Get to it!

966
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:46,804
It's the fallen mast! We can't lay alongside.

967
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:49,801
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I’ll draw their fire.

968
01:46:49,889 --> 01:46:53,677
- My division to join Mr Pullings!
- Clew up topsails!

969
01:46:53,769 --> 01:46:56,647
- Huzzah for Lucky Jack!
- Huzzah!

970
01:46:56,729 --> 01:46:59,243
Grappling hooks away!

971
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:01,638
Run out the boarding planks!

972
01:47:03,688 --> 01:47:08,637
- My division, follow me!
- For England, for home, and for the prize!

973
01:47:09,248 --> 01:47:11,716
Here we go, lads!

974
01:47:15,727 --> 01:47:17,718
Pipe down. Silence.

975
01:47:39,565 --> 01:47:41,476
Looks like the job is done, sir.

976
01:47:41,565 --> 01:47:43,237
Acheron!

977
01:47:56,964 --> 01:47:58,113
Fire!

978
01:48:14,163 --> 01:48:16,437
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder!

979
01:48:16,522 --> 01:48:18,319
That's it!

980
01:48:18,402 --> 01:48:19,437
Fire!

981
01:48:20,682 --> 01:48:22,877
Keep moving, men! Keep moving!

982
01:49:09,998 --> 01:49:11,795
Joe!

983
01:49:17,438 --> 01:49:18,995
Grenades, ready!

984
01:49:28,757 --> 01:49:31,589
They're aiming for our hull!

985
01:49:31,676 --> 01:49:34,270
They could sink us! Depress the muzzle!

986
01:49:34,316 --> 01:49:36,272
Padeen, train it aft!

987
01:49:36,356 --> 01:49:37,948
Together now!

988
01:49:38,836 --> 01:49:40,872
Stand clear!

989
01:49:40,956 --> 01:49:42,674
Fire!

990
01:49:43,515 --> 01:49:45,824
Arm yourselves! We must board them!

991
01:49:47,155 --> 01:49:49,146
Follow me!

992
01:50:03,954 --> 01:50:05,626
Now!

993
01:50:10,113 --> 01:50:14,072
Whalers, follow me!
Mr Hogg, down below! Quickly now!

994
01:50:16,433 --> 01:50:20,062
Albatrosses! Albatrosses, do you hear me?

995
01:50:20,992 --> 01:50:22,948
To the guns! To the guns!

996
01:50:26,392 --> 01:50:28,622
Boyle, douse that gun's priming!

997
01:51:02,389 --> 01:51:05,267
Lively there! Come on! Move!

998
01:51:08,669 --> 01:51:11,262
Now do your worst!

999
01:51:26,107 --> 01:51:28,223
Non! Non! Non!

1000
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:43,183
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

1001
01:51:43,266 --> 01:51:45,780
- Have they struck their colours?
- I believe so.

1002
01:51:45,866 --> 01:51:49,380
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

1003
01:51:49,465 --> 01:51:51,262
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

1004
01:52:12,024 --> 01:52:15,254
- Le capitaine?
- L'infirmerie.

1005
01:52:32,302 --> 01:52:34,293
Docteur? Docteur?

1006
01:52:34,382 --> 01:52:36,373
Oui.

1007
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:53,009
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.

1008
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,773
I did what I could for him.

1009
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:04,618
Before the capitaine died...
he said I was to give you this.

1010
01:54:30,932 --> 01:54:33,765
No. I’ll do it.

1011
01:54:46,931 --> 01:54:49,240
Can you help me?

1012
01:55:12,129 --> 01:55:13,881
Our Father,

1013
01:55:13,969 --> 01:55:17,848
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1014
01:55:17,929 --> 01:55:21,637
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1015
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:24,003
on earth as it is in heaven.

1016
01:55:24,648 --> 01:55:27,287
Give us this day our daily bread,

1017
01:55:27,368 --> 01:55:32,077
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1018
01:55:32,167 --> 01:55:36,080
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1019
01:55:36,167 --> 01:55:38,044
For thine is the kingdom,

1020
01:55:38,127 --> 01:55:40,083
the power and the glory,

1021
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:42,158
forever and ever.

1022
01:55:42,247 --> 01:55:43,726
Amen.

1023
01:55:44,326 --> 01:55:47,636
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

1024
01:55:47,726 --> 01:55:51,401
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

1025
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:54,398
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

1026
01:55:55,566 --> 01:55:59,319
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

1027
01:56:00,525 --> 01:56:04,313
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

1028
01:56:05,765 --> 01:56:09,279
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

1029
01:56:10,844 --> 01:56:13,961
John Allen, sailing master.

1030
01:56:19,244 --> 01:56:21,155
Peter Miles Calamy...

1031
01:56:25,683 --> 01:56:27,833
lieutenant.

1032
01:56:30,163 --> 01:56:33,280
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

1033
01:56:33,363 --> 01:56:35,432
to be turned into corruption,

1034
01:56:35,522 --> 01:56:39,197
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

1035
01:56:39,282 --> 01:56:42,035
and the life of the world to come,

1036
01:56:42,122 --> 01:56:45,319
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1037
01:56:45,402 --> 01:56:47,392
Amen.

1038
01:57:15,079 --> 01:57:17,274
It's our old friend.

1039
01:58:09,435 --> 01:58:12,313
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1040
01:58:18,554 --> 01:58:22,547
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

1041
01:58:22,634 --> 01:58:24,192
Good, good.

1042
01:58:24,274 --> 01:58:26,946
I think I shall return to the Galápagos.

1043
01:58:27,033 --> 01:58:30,628
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1044
01:58:30,713 --> 01:58:31,862
Very good, sir.

1045
01:58:31,953 --> 01:58:35,263
You, however,
shall take the Acheron south to Valparaiso.

1046
01:58:35,353 --> 01:58:40,346
Parole the prisoners there, refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1047
01:58:40,432 --> 01:58:43,344
I believe Mr Hogg
would be a good choice for sailing master.

1048
01:58:43,432 --> 01:58:47,983
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

1049
01:58:52,711 --> 01:58:54,702
Your orders.

1050
01:58:58,351 --> 01:59:00,990
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

1051
01:59:01,071 --> 01:59:02,982
And to you, sir.

1052
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:10,387
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

1053
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:13,064
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

1054
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:16,465
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings!

1055
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:18,380
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1056
01:59:18,829 --> 01:59:20,626
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1057
01:59:20,989 --> 01:59:23,708
- Hip, hip...
- Huzzah!

1058
01:59:23,789 --> 01:59:27,384
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

1059
01:59:42,747 --> 01:59:44,578
Oh, here we go again.

1060
01:59:44,667 --> 01:59:47,022
Killick! Killick there!

1061
01:59:47,107 --> 01:59:49,780
Which it will be ready when it's ready!

1062
01:59:55,106 --> 01:59:57,904
I’ll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

1063
01:59:57,986 --> 02:00:03,060
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1064
02:00:03,146 --> 02:00:06,660
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

1065
02:00:06,745 --> 02:00:11,341
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

1066
02:00:11,425 --> 02:00:13,893
- De Vigny?
- Mm.

1067
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,142
Ah.

1068
02:00:24,944 --> 02:00:28,573
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1069
02:00:28,664 --> 02:00:31,575
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1070
02:00:32,503 --> 02:00:33,652
Sir.

1071
02:00:33,743 --> 02:00:36,655
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

1072
02:00:36,743 --> 02:00:40,099
We'll intercept the Acheron
and escort them into Valparaiso.

1073
02:00:40,183 --> 02:00:42,935
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

1074
02:00:43,942 --> 02:00:46,581
- And William...
- Sir?

1075
02:00:46,662 --> 02:00:49,301
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

1076
02:00:54,142 --> 02:00:57,451
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1077
02:01:01,021 --> 02:01:02,613
Ah.

1078
02:01:04,581 --> 02:01:07,777
Well, Stephen... the bird's flightless?

1079
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:08,895
Yes.

1080
02:01:09,940 --> 02:01:12,534
It's not going anywhere.

1081
02:11:10,012 --> 02:11:13,288
