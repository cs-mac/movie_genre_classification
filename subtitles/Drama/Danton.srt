1
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,764
Your papers.

2
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:49,181
What are you doing?
It's only wood.

3
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:52,432
All right.

4
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,349
It's nothing.

5
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:56,016
Just firewood from Paris.

6
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,808
Let's see anyway.

7
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,600
Leave my things alonel

8
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,267
What's in there?

9
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,642
Unload those books.
Go through everything.

10
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,768
Leave nothing to chance.

11
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:12,852
Spare no one.

12
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,770
Leave me alone!

13
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:40,272
Follow him! Hurry!

14
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:43,731
PARIS
SPRING 1 794

15
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,024
2ND YEAR OF
THE REPUBLIC

16
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:40,739
A good revolutionary must be tough.

17
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:43,240
Article One.

18
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,907
All men are born free
and equal under the law.

19
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:49,158
Social differences...

20
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,992
Must be based...

21
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,618
...on the public good.

22
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,201
The principle...
- The goal.

23
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,743
The goal of political parties

24
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,244
is the good of the nation.

25
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:13,870
Freedom is being able to do

26
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:17,120
whatever does not harm others.

27
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,620
Therefore... the...

28
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:24,422
Maxime.

29
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,799
No bread again?

30
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:49,133
They say it's the war.

31
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:54,425
The war doesn't explain everything.
The shortage of bread is a plot.

32
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:55,676
On whose part?

33
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,718
The enemies of the government.

34
00:05:59,052 --> 00:06:01,385
Starvation leads to revolt.

35
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,803
- Maybe the government's behind it.
- Why?

36
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,719
Power corrupts.
A story as old as...

37
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:09,552
Watch out.

38
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:22,804
You speak for Robespierre too?

39
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:31,222
They're starting early this morning.

40
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,556
Who's that?

41
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:35,015
A runaway.
They caught him at Vincennes.

42
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:38,015
He's so handsome.

43
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,933
Why do they go on foot?
Is that the new fashion?

44
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,433
Walking back will be harder, Count.

45
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,183
You'll have to carry your head.

46
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,815
Break down the door!

47
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,358
- Give me your card.
- Me? Why?

48
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:42,733
Your card!

49
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:45,942
What have I done?
I didn't do anything.

50
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,651
Will you cut my head off?

51
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:54,152
Look, it's himl

52
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:59,111
It's Danton!

53
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,698
Long live the Republic!

54
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,823
Long live Danton!

55
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,616
"Despotism is killing innocent people
so that the guilty don't escape.

56
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:47,785
The Committee thought the Republic
needed a period of despotism.

57
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,993
They agreed with Machiavelli

58
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,577
that the greater good
excuses minor evils.

59
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:59,328
They felt liberty is like growing up:
You have to suffer.

60
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:03,453
They are wrong.
To be free, men only need

61
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:06,412
to want to be free.

62
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,537
This has been their right
since Bastille Day.

63
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:12,454
What is the last defense
against despotism?

64
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,372
A free press.

65
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,539
If Moscow had one,
they'd be a republic tomorrow.

66
00:09:17,706 --> 00:09:20,123
Destroy it in France and ..."
- Be quiet.

67
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,998
Has it been distributed
throughout the city?

68
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,624
No, it's still at the printers.

69
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,916
What are you waiting for?

70
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,922
Citizen barber, you may enter.

71
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,839
Health and fraternity.

72
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:21,298
Fine day.

73
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,799
Spring at last.

74
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,757
You don't look well at all.

75
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:35,800
True, you've been ill for five weeks.

76
00:10:37,176 --> 00:10:39,509
We'll fix that. Comb.

77
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,467
Hairpins.

78
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,302
I'll trim it tomorrow.

79
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,138
You're crazy.
What are you doing?

80
00:11:10,347 --> 00:11:13,555
What's going on? Let me dress.

81
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,431
Have you gone crazy?

82
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:26,057
Heron, you have no right!

83
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,106
What are they doing to you?

84
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,606
It's Camille Desmoulins.
He's the one to arrest.

85
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,398
It's true. Arrest me.
He's innocent. He's only the printer.

86
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:21,149
Sorry, but we have no orders
to arrest you, Desmoulins.

87
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,901
I prefer not to look.

88
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,026
Come back tomorrow
at the usual time.

89
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,571
You're up.

90
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,739
Feeling better?

91
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,490
Wonderful.

92
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:16,531
Danton is back from the country.

93
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,532
He's plotting a coup.

94
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,700
Have you read this?
- Not yet.

95
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:30,576
Desmoulins urges the people
to fight the Committees.

96
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,201
For three days, Paris has spoken
of nothing but takeover and dictatorship.

97
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,535
By whom?

98
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,868
Nobody speaks the name,

99
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,244
but I think it's...

100
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,828
Danton.

101
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,830
Has he lost his mind?

102
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:07,414
We'd spare the Republic
a lot of trouble

103
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,290
if we sent Danton
to the guillotine right now.

104
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:18,249
No, they idolize him.

105
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,541
And he's not really
all that dangerous.

106
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,084
Damn it!

107
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,918
If it isn't him, it's Desmoulins.

108
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:46,545
Real bread, citizen?

109
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,420
Yes, but there's no sugar.

110
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:51,462
No matter.

111
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,882
- There's no sugar.
- Thank you. I haven't slept.

112
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,507
I'm very tired.

113
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,925
Danton's behind
Desmoulins' attacks on us.

114
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,425
He has Camille in his pocket.

115
00:15:22,717 --> 00:15:24,800
What's our real aim?

116
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,801
The Revolution's triumph.

117
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,385
Right. But not at any price.

118
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:32,093
Why all this carnage?

119
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,718
There are easier ways.
- Like what?

120
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:44,720
Desmoulins and Danton will be
beheaded without your permission.

121
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:52,637
Is it really so cold?

122
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,222
Please pass me my coat.

123
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,472
Is your fever back?

124
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,891
It'll pass.

125
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:29,143
I forbid you to ogle
citizen Robespierre like that.

126
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:00,231
COMMITTEES ARE DICTATORSHIP

127
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:15,242
Clear the hall.

128
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,035
That's enough!

129
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:43,038
Citizens,

130
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,746
attacks against
the government are increasing.

131
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:48,122
Desmoulins' paper calls

132
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,372
for war on the Committees.

133
00:18:50,498 --> 00:18:51,998
I charge Danton and his friends...

134
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,457
Sorry I'm late.

135
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,123
Just like school.

136
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,582
I charge Danton and his friends
with subversion.

137
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,165
What?

138
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,625
You'd deprive the Revolution
of its best servants?

139
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:08,167
Come, Billaud.
You can't be serious.

140
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:09,959
Go ahead.

141
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,375
- You surprise me, Robespierre.
- Danton loyal?

142
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,584
You're mad.

143
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:18,751
No, but I remember,
and you've forgotten.

144
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:22,044
You've forgotten everything
done by the man

145
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,377
you're now so eager to kill.

146
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:29,961
Remember that it was he
who set up our revolutionary club

147
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:35,087
in 1 790 and 1 791.
Never forget that.

148
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:37,630
Then don't you forget
the Champ de Mars massacre!

149
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:39,962
He led the people into it like sheep!

150
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:41,588
And then fled to the country.

151
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,296
Let's stop all this.

152
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:49,547
We recall Mirabeau's letter
denouncing Danton's plotting.

153
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:52,673
Why trust a traitor's word?

154
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,715
Lawyer's tricks!

155
00:19:56,924 --> 00:20:01,091
You can't base such a serious charge

156
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,216
on rumors alone.

157
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:06,300
I insist we call Citizen Amar

158
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:09,258
of the Security Committee.

159
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:14,467
On no pretext can I allow

160
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:17,302
Danton to go on trial.

161
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:20,094
Afraid, Robespierre?

162
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,594
I know it would be easier to kill him,

163
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:27,719
but I say his good faith
is beyond question.

164
00:20:29,054 --> 00:20:31,971
Killing this defenseless man
is senseless.

165
00:20:32,138 --> 00:20:33,971
Defenseless?

166
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:37,388
His only weapon was that paper.

167
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,930
Was?

168
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,597
Yes. I had the paper closed down.

169
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:49,265
Desmoulins will replace it
with another.

170
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,098
Then we'll...

171
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:52,931
Get rid of Desmoulins.

172
00:20:56,391 --> 00:21:00,141
No, we'll win him over.

173
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,684
He's a great propagandist.

174
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,101
Citizen Amar.

175
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:16,019
Good day, Amar.
Do you have evidence against Danton?

176
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,313
Go on.

177
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,064
Read it!

178
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:40,355
What?

179
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,064
Praying?

180
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:52,941
I want what I'm about to say
kept quiet.

181
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:58,482
Citizens, like you,
I doubt Danton's good faith.

182
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,108
Finally!

183
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,942
And yet

184
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:12,110
I categorically oppose
his execution.

185
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:18,778
Justice is divine
and thus beyond our reach.

186
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:23,945
The Revolutionary Tribunal
cannot be Justice.

187
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,988
It can only punish
the nation's enemies,

188
00:22:30,196 --> 00:22:33,571
not clamp down on criminals.

189
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:37,697
These men are guilty of crimes.

190
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,865
The ax will fall
on Fabre and his friends.

191
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,907
Danton's the guiltiest,
but we will not touch him.

192
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:52,616
If we do, the bourgeoisie
will join the counterrevolution.

193
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,658
Execute Danton, and the Convention
would rise against us.

194
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:02,992
We'd shake the people's faith
in the Revolution.

195
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,118
And then

196
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:09,202
we'd have to rule by terror.

197
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,535
You know what that is?

198
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:16,536
Terror is nothing but despair.

199
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,995
Yes, Billaud, I'm afraid.

200
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,454
So afraid of the terror

201
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:27,913
that I'm ready
for any compromise to avoid it.

202
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Any humiliation, any lie.

203
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:38,331
The traitor Danton must be granted
a favor he perhaps doesn't deserve:

204
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:41,831
amnesty.

205
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:45,540
For the country's good,
we must be ruthless.

206
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,249
We can't afford to be just.

207
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:20,087
About time you came.

208
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,129
- So you're back.
- Yes. I was bored.

209
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:33,297
- I've come for my orders.
- What orders?

210
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:45,299
Here's what I say:
First free the prisoners.

211
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,841
I'll summon our fighting men.

212
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:52,550
We'll raid the Convention
and kill the leaders.

213
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,092
Fine. I wish you luck.

214
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:58,468
Don't you understand?
Robespierre's on the move.

215
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,177
In an hour
the Committee will grab us,

216
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,093
and you're vulnerable too.

217
00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:05,844
Why? What have I done?

218
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:11,053
Suppose they talk of the Supreme Judge
and mention your name.

219
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,762
They'll say you want
to be a dictator.

220
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,179
One rumor, and you've had it.

221
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,596
Who would dare condemn me?

222
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,679
The Committee, of course.

223
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,846
Robespierre is back on his feet.

224
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:28,764
That absurd Committee?

225
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:31,306
You're so sure of yourself.

226
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,806
Use your head.

227
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:37,265
I am the man of August 1 0.
All of Paris is behind me.

228
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:42,473
It's now or never, believe me!

229
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:48,225
I'm surprised you're still free.

230
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:50,892
It's a miracle...
and a bit suspicious.

231
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,226
But I get it: You're my friend.
They can't arrest my friends.

232
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:58,310
I have something Robespierre lacks:
my newspaper.

233
00:25:58,435 --> 00:26:01,727
It gives me more influence
than that charlatan.

234
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,311
Does that reassure you?

235
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,604
Georges!

236
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:15,854
The paper's been closed
and the printer arrested.

237
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:19,979
Reassured indeed.
Now we're finished!

238
00:26:24,814 --> 00:26:26,689
You could at least say hello, Camille.

239
00:26:26,856 --> 00:26:28,814
How are you, Lucille?

240
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,648
Perhaps we've gone too far.

241
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:34,856
If you're scared, run to Robespierre.

242
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:37,357
Tell him I made you write it.

243
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:40,232
Stop it. I did my duty.

244
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,108
I showed people the terror must end.

245
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:47,733
Now you must act,
or what I did was pointless.

246
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:51,109
- We must act at once.
- Why?

247
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,317
- The printer was closed down.
- I know.

248
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:56,944
- Don't you want to save your skin?
- Sure. Why shouldn't I?

249
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,068
Don't you, Boucher?

250
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:00,027
We must strike.

251
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:04,111
This is politics, not butchery.
Use your heads.

252
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,362
Camille made Robespierre look bad.

253
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,528
Now he's trying
to salvage his prestige.

254
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:13,487
So he jails the printer
and seizes the paper.

255
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:16,988
He's provoking us
in hopes he'll force our hand.

256
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:18,738
So instead we do nothing.

257
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:21,155
We must stay calm.
Understand?

258
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,573
Philippeaux wants to speak to you.

259
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,157
Who is he? Liberal? Moderate?

260
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:36,491
A spotless record. He's ideal.

261
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,992
Danton's wrong.
How can I persuade him to act?

262
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,867
You want to attack
the Committee too?

263
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:47,617
Not yet.

264
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:49,325
I'm wondering myself.

265
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,618
I'd like to know what you want.

266
00:27:51,785 --> 00:27:52,826
Me too.

267
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,659
You'd end the terror?

268
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,202
You'd topple the regime?

269
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:59,911
I'd join you if I was convinced
your motives were pure.

270
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,328
Don't you believe me?

271
00:28:05,704 --> 00:28:06,662
Why?

272
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:10,954
It was you who created
the Revolutionary Tribunal.

273
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,954
You voted to kill the king.

274
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:14,121
So did you.

275
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,496
We'll get nowhere like this.

276
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:18,872
Did I ask for your help?

277
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:22,705
He wants to back you.
The center's with him.

278
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,956
Guarantee that you won't
abuse your power.

279
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:27,123
- I'm not after power.
- So you say now.

280
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,082
I don't want power.
I'm 35 and look 60.

281
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:35,374
I'm tired. I'd like to quit.

282
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,625
But first I must end the terror,

283
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,958
because I'm partly to blame for it.

284
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,083
That's fine, but we didn't
just meet yesterday.

285
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,042
So?

286
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:47,959
You don't need money
from politics, it's true.

287
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,168
Take it easy!

288
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:53,877
You asked to talk to me!

289
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,043
Georges, this isn't the time.

290
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:59,919
All right. Make it quick.
What do you want?

291
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:03,795
The Public Safety Committee
has exceeded its mandate.

292
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,253
Dismantle it without a fight.
Only you can do that.

293
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:11,338
Frankly, you disgust me,

294
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,838
but I'll back you.

295
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm flattered.
How will you do it?

296
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,590
With armed men, if need be.

297
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:22,672
Worried?

298
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,673
Yes. Like everyone.

299
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:31,007
You really want to act?

300
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:33,466
Strike, I tell you.

301
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:37,300
No one can control
an insurrection.

302
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,925
Robespierre has one weakness:

303
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,300
his secret police,
whom everyone hates.

304
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:45,135
So, Bourdon, in the Convention today,

305
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:47,468
attack a top secret agent.

306
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:48,343
Heron?

307
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,968
Yes, he'll do.
Talk about informers, searches.

308
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:54,344
The nation will support you.

309
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:58,844
It will say
we're its last hope for freedom.

310
00:29:59,012 --> 00:30:00,470
Will that be enough?

311
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:04,512
Yes, they'll calm down,
and so will Robespierre. Go on.

312
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,096
Georges is right.

313
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:11,097
You should always heed your wife.

314
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:14,305
It's the start of a new era.
Get going.

315
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:20,848
Then it's back
to our modest, quiet lives.

316
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:25,015
Yours will be quiet
and ours modest.

317
00:30:25,182 --> 00:30:29,974
If you see poverty
as a revolutionary virtue,

318
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,307
go and join Robespierre.

319
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,475
And you find a new printer.

320
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:50,978
What is more destructive,

321
00:30:51,353 --> 00:30:53,936
more anti-Republican,

322
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,645
than this invisible police

323
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,645
and its informers?

324
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:04,646
They infiltrate everywhere,
spreading lies

325
00:31:04,813 --> 00:31:07,313
and making threats.

326
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,939
They endanger individual liberty,

327
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:17,023
force fathers to mistrust their sons,

328
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:20,565
and think they're all-powerful.

329
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:30,358
This police is headed

330
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:34,775
by an ex-criminal named Heron,

331
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,317
who, under the cloak...

332
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:42,360
Who, under the cloak...

333
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,402
of public service,

334
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:48,152
settles private scores

335
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:53,028
and openly favors
the rogues he recruits.

336
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:03,154
Where's he rushing off to?

337
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,822
The Committee.
As soon as Heron was mentioned...

338
00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:11,656
I demand Heron's arrestl

339
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:26,783
The Convention voted
to arrest Heron.

340
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,450
Our best man?
Lose him and we lose control of Paris.

341
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:35,242
There's your defenseless Danton.

342
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,535
I want to see him today.

343
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,743
That traitor?

344
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,286
Barere, arrange the meeting.

345
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,203
This session is ended.

346
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:55,204
You'd lower yourself so far as
to ask Danton to receive you?

347
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:59,538
What does humiliation matter
if it's for the country's good?

348
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:02,580
For that I'd stoop to anything.

349
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,833
The Public Safety Committee's
done for!

350
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:36,459
Long live Danton!

351
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:50,545
I've come from the Committee.

352
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:54,629
Some accuse you of high treason.
- Only me?

353
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:57,713
The others too. All of them.

354
00:33:58,255 --> 00:34:00,588
And Robespierre agrees?

355
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:03,589
- Don't know yet. Anyway, I'm off.
- Afraid?

356
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:06,381
I'd rather not be seen
in your company.

357
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:29,842
...jailed for demanding liberty.

358
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:35,802
No, change those.

359
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:40,761
Use only blue flowers.
He only likes blue.

360
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,220
Turbot a la flunkey,
it's called now.

361
00:34:53,388 --> 00:34:55,054
What a creature.

362
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:59,555
We start with stuffed cucumber.
Then vol-au-vent.

363
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:04,681
With Convention sauce,

364
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:07,348
once known as caper sauce.

365
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:11,515
Refugee quails with onions.

366
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:12,890
That's it.

367
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:16,558
And fruit in Varennes sauce.

368
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,059
- Everything satisfactory?
- Perfectly, thank you.

369
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:32,851
You should have made him beg,
or arrived late and dressed in rags.

370
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,394
A gesture won't hurt.
It's now or never.

371
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:37,519
Leave me alone.
Go home, please.

372
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,853
I want to see him humiliated, please.

373
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,812
Go home. You too, Bourdon!

374
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:46,020
Certainly not.

375
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:50,938
I must know how to vote
in the Convention.

376
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,980
I said go home!

377
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:55,772
Everybody out.

378
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:00,314
Now, that's blue. Fine.

379
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:21,109
Bourdon, get rid of all these people.

380
00:36:21,276 --> 00:36:23,401
Quick. I need privacy.

381
00:36:23,568 --> 00:36:25,609
Right away.

382
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:32,194
You dare tell me that?

383
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:44,778
Clear out, all of you!

384
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:46,529
- Are you mad?
- Security.

385
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:19,159
Out!

386
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,790
Good evening.
I kept you waiting. Sorry.

387
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:07,916
No matter.
We're so rarely alone together,

388
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,791
you and I.

389
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,792
- Everything all right, citizen?
- Fine, thanks.

390
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:23,918
Look.

391
00:38:25,586 --> 00:38:27,586
Would you like some?

392
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,086
How about this?

393
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,670
It's magnificent.

394
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,879
A little quail?

395
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,880
It's not poisoned. Look.

396
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,379
Delicious.

397
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:51,256
Sit down.

398
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,218
You're really not hungry?

399
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:51,723
What do you want?

400
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,099
To be frank with you.

401
00:39:56,974 --> 00:39:59,224
Haven't you always been?

402
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,725
Why did you attack Heron?

403
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:09,184
Why did you arrest Dessenne
and ban the paper?

404
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:11,768
I must protect the government.
But you?

405
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:15,435
I don't understand.
They say you're hatching a plot.

406
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,602
It's not true, and you know it.

407
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:20,852
I'm pure as snow.

408
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,894
Your many enemies want your death.

409
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,103
Are you among them?

410
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:32,062
Stop attacking me,
and I give you my word you'll be safe.

411
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:35,104
Am I not safe now?

412
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,606
I thought you didn't drink.

413
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:01,733
To our understanding.

414
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,320
What do you want?

415
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,029
You're frank. I like that.

416
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:36,571
State publicly that you're joining us.

417
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:38,613
- Impossible.
- Why?

418
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:42,323
I don't approve of the government.
I have that right.

419
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:45,573
But not the right to proclaim it.
Especially not you.

420
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:48,573
You can't want me to grovel
before the government.

421
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:51,907
Do you think you're above it?

422
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:55,907
All exceptional people
are above the masses.

423
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:59,200
I despise the Committees
as much as you do, but I say so.

424
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,492
No one must divide us, you and I.

425
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,201
No committee, no government, no one.

426
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:07,451
Divided, we both fall.

427
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:11,951
I can't go along with your reign of terror,
and no one else will either.

428
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:16,577
The people, our strength,
will destroy the Revolution.

429
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:18,410
And who's to blame for that?

430
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,453
Not l, and certainly not you.

431
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:27,079
If we're not to blame,
then it's fate.

432
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,662
I've never believed in fate.

433
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:31,246
Nor have I.

434
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,747
Deep down
we share the same ideals.

435
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,789
No longer.

436
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,789
We fought a revolution

437
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,664
in the name of fairness and equality.

438
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,957
Now you chop off any head above the rest.
Was that what we fought for?

439
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:51,666
I'm the people's only defense.

440
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,416
Against whom?

441
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:59,792
Men who grow rich
from the Revolution. Am I right?

442
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:06,668
You want men to act like
the heroes of novels.

443
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,669
You forget we're made
of flesh and blood.

444
00:43:10,836 --> 00:43:14,419
You want to raise us to heights

445
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:16,252
where we can't breathe.

446
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,670
You end up isolating the Revolution.
You freeze it.

447
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:22,003
Even its most fervent
supporters back off.

448
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:24,462
What is your advice?

449
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:31,296
Come back to earth.
At once.

450
00:43:31,464 --> 00:43:36,298
Stop the revolutionary impetus
and you kill the revolution.

451
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:39,590
People just want
to eat and sleep in peace.

452
00:43:39,757 --> 00:43:41,965
Without bread, there's no law,
no freedom, no justice,

453
00:43:42,132 --> 00:43:44,257
no Republic.

454
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,258
To hell with the Committees.

455
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:51,258
But I admire you.

456
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:56,967
I'd love to follow you,
but not just anywhere.

457
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,176
I want to provide
normal living conditions

458
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:03,176
for 80% of the people.
That's all.

459
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:06,302
Please stop. I know you well.

460
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:08,802
No need for speeches here.
- What?

461
00:44:13,636 --> 00:44:15,928
That's not all you want.

462
00:44:19,012 --> 00:44:22,387
The same men mustn't stay
in power too long.

463
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:23,679
You aspire to power?

464
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:26,638
I don't need to aspire to power.
I have it.

465
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:30,805
The only real power:
from the man in the street.

466
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:33,973
Because I understand him
and he understands me.

467
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:36,431
Never forget that.
- I won't.

468
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:38,722
But likewise don't you forget

469
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,015
that I'll stop at nothing
to bring happiness to the people.

470
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:45,515
Bring happiness to the people?

471
00:44:47,558 --> 00:44:49,766
You know nothing of the people!

472
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,100
How could you know? Look at you.

473
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:55,559
You don't drink,
you in your powdered wigs!

474
00:44:55,726 --> 00:45:00,101
Swords make you faint,
and they say you've never had a woman.

475
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:04,602
Who do you speak for?

476
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,394
Make men happy?
You're not even a man yourself.

477
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,229
I'll show you the people.
Let's take a walk through the streets.

478
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:29,522
I'm sorry.

479
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:33,106
I've always been a clumsy brute.

480
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:40,190
I woke last night thinking that
for you and me to be feuding,

481
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:44,358
to be enemies,
makes no sense at all.

482
00:45:45,317 --> 00:45:48,775
We must stop it at once.

483
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:51,984
Then do what I ask.

484
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:53,442
How?

485
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:56,859
Do what I ask. Join us.

486
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:03,361
I went to the country
to think things over.

487
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:08,112
And I must tell you very frankly,

488
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,987
I'd rather be executed
than be an executioner.

489
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,153
What are you saying?
You're drunk.

490
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:17,821
If you insist,

491
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:20,529
you see this head?

492
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,280
See it?

493
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,739
Feel it?

494
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:29,656
You'll have to cut it off.

495
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:15,620
I'm sorry.
This was a mistake.

496
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:18,121
Good night.

497
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,372
Wait!

498
00:47:26,498 --> 00:47:28,998
My witnesses heard everything.

499
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:35,249
That's why I said nothing.
Good night.

500
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,627
- Where did he go?
- What happened?

501
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:00,378
Now I've got him.

502
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:06,254
I've got him.

503
00:48:54,802 --> 00:48:57,885
So I had it all wrong, huh?

504
00:48:58,053 --> 00:49:01,220
Now you see.
The Committees must end.

505
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:03,637
You were wrong about Robespierre.

506
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:07,053
Come quickly.
We must hurry to the meeting.

507
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:11,596
No point.
Your plan is childish.

508
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,222
It's now or never.

509
00:49:16,014 --> 00:49:18,972
No more blood!
That's what I'm fighting for!

510
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:20,889
What?

511
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:23,681
That's what I'm fighting for.

512
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:26,015
You're telling me?

513
00:49:27,016 --> 00:49:28,516
Yes, you.

514
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,848
You prefer your blood to flow,
or your friends'?

515
00:49:55,103 --> 00:49:56,644
Good to see you.

516
00:49:56,853 --> 00:49:58,019
How's your mother?

517
00:49:58,187 --> 00:49:59,853
Worse than ever.

518
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:03,604
This is Sophie, from Nantes.

519
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:05,312
Go to your meeting.

520
00:50:06,146 --> 00:50:10,521
I can't come tonight.
It was just to get rid of him.

521
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:14,647
You coming?

522
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:24,607
"A free press is the greatest terror
to ambitious despots."

523
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:47,901
What happened?

524
00:50:48,902 --> 00:50:50,527
Say something.

525
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,236
Tell me.

526
00:50:52,403 --> 00:50:56,361
It's war.
Danton forced the issue.

527
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,861
What?

528
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:00,487
Robespierre is due for a lesson.

529
00:51:01,029 --> 00:51:05,112
Tell me what happened,
everything they said.

530
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,530
I don't know.
I couldn't hear well.

531
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:15,906
This frightens me terribly.

532
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:20,282
For three months
I've had a foreboding.

533
00:51:52,578 --> 00:51:54,036
Is your husband in?

534
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:55,662
I'm glad you came.

535
00:51:55,829 --> 00:51:57,662
Why?

536
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:01,537
You've changed a lot.

537
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:04,913
You're like a stranger now.

538
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,497
I've aged, if that's what you mean.

539
00:52:08,664 --> 00:52:10,664
That's not it, but...

540
00:52:11,706 --> 00:52:14,206
Is he really in danger?

541
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:17,706
Yes, he is.

542
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:20,749
You're my only hope.

543
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:24,208
Tell me, why did you push him away?

544
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,083
The opposite happened. Truly.

545
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:32,167
Really? Then I misunderstood.

546
00:52:32,376 --> 00:52:36,376
How could you?
Camille was your friend.

547
00:52:36,543 --> 00:52:38,584
That's why I've come.

548
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:41,210
I said I was in for no one.

549
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:34,676
We must talk. It's serious.

550
00:53:34,843 --> 00:53:36,426
Why bother?

551
00:53:36,594 --> 00:53:41,178
You're in grave danger.
I came to warn you.

552
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,012
You don't realize
your life's at stake.

553
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:59,888
Your friend Danton is using you.

554
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:04,347
He's exploiting your talent.

555
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:10,182
He's only out for himself.
That's not friendship.

556
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:13,015
It's a suspicious alliance.

557
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:14,724
Stop!

558
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,557
You don't scare me.
A freedom fighter isn't afraid to die.

559
00:54:19,808 --> 00:54:21,516
Maybe that's the price he pays.

560
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:24,558
By advocating charity and tolerance,

561
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:29,893
you hoped to save our country.
Right?

562
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:33,018
But you're aiding subversion.

563
00:54:33,185 --> 00:54:35,810
That's Danton's goal.

564
00:54:42,186 --> 00:54:43,686
You must understand.

565
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:46,229
So what should I do?

566
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:54,354
Make a speech tomorrow
in the Convention.

567
00:54:55,897 --> 00:54:59,105
Take back all your attacks.

568
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:04,855
Then, in the next issue of your paper,

569
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:10,399
retract what you've said
in previous issues.

570
00:55:10,566 --> 00:55:13,191
You're like a common strumpet!

571
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:17,857
Danton threw you out,
so you crawl to me!

572
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:20,233
You're terrified!

573
00:55:22,526 --> 00:55:26,151
Maxime, remember:

574
00:55:27,318 --> 00:55:29,443
Burning a newspaper

575
00:55:29,568 --> 00:55:31,193
is no answer.

576
00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:38,277
It's your last chance.

577
00:55:38,445 --> 00:55:41,695
Listen to me, or you're through.

578
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:44,695
You must believe me.

579
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:47,946
I swear it's true.

580
00:55:51,322 --> 00:55:53,155
Get out.

581
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:46,120
What happened?
You must tell me!

582
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,205
Why did the two of them meet?

583
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:55,872
If Danton and Robespierre
have disagreed for so long,

584
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:57,831
it would seem a bit late now.

585
00:57:00,457 --> 00:57:03,415
He's not here yet? Good.

586
00:57:03,582 --> 00:57:09,041
No, but you're
1 0 minutes late, Saint-Just.

587
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:13,458
What joy.
You remind me of my youth.

588
00:57:24,835 --> 00:57:26,626
Forgive my lateness.

589
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:30,836
Spoken like a king to his ministers.

590
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,920
Then how should I speak?

591
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:46,588
In one hour, at 3:30,

592
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,755
the police must arrest Danton.

593
00:57:49,922 --> 00:57:51,713
Tonight? So soon?

594
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,797
It's madness!

595
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:56,381
Out of the question.

596
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,048
Danton and his accomplices.

597
00:57:59,215 --> 00:58:01,173
Without preparing the people?

598
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:04,257
It's political suicide.

599
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:06,924
We'll face certain defeat.

600
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:11,675
The Committee must prepare
public opinion.

601
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:15,468
Let me have my say.

602
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,092
Robespierre,

603
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,218
Danton has the bankers' support.
You told us that.

604
00:58:21,427 --> 00:58:26,302
It will be the Committee's death
and Danton's triumph.

605
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,927
You're right.
Danton has support everywhere.

606
00:58:30,095 --> 00:58:32,053
It won't work.

607
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:35,553
I wish to speak.

608
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,262
Not about that!

609
00:58:40,096 --> 00:58:42,262
We must strike like lightning.

610
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:46,013
Give him three days
and he'll get gold from the bankers.

611
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,097
He'll raise an army
and spread leaflets all over Paris.

612
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:54,306
He'll address the Convention.

613
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:59,015
Everyone here knows
he's a great orator.

614
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:04,015
We must do it tonight...
or never.

615
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:08,058
You're right.

616
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:12,434
If it causes panic
in the Convention, I'll step in.

617
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:15,059
We need an indictment.

618
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:17,351
Who will write it?

619
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:21,269
It's already written.

620
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,269
Read it.

621
00:59:26,103 --> 00:59:29,103
Allow me first to read it once more.

622
00:59:30,312 --> 00:59:34,354
We need the approval
of the Public Safety Committee.

623
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:36,229
Out of the question.

624
00:59:36,396 --> 00:59:38,146
Call them in.

625
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:41,396
Are they still here?

626
00:59:41,605 --> 00:59:43,605
The session's just ending.

627
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:45,813
Ask them to come in.

628
00:59:50,065 --> 00:59:52,273
What changed your mind?

629
00:59:56,649 --> 00:59:58,440
Who else besides Danton?

630
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:03,733
Here's my list:
Lacroix, Philippeaux...

631
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Entirely innocent.

632
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:09,609
Their intentions may be,
but we judge facts!

633
01:00:09,776 --> 01:00:12,193
Legendre, Bourdon.

634
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:18,443
Innocent puppets.
Let's avoid a bloodbath, please.

635
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:21,403
The first humane words of the night.

636
01:00:21,569 --> 01:00:25,236
All right. We'll spare them.

637
01:00:25,653 --> 01:00:26,986
Desmoulins?

638
01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:34,112
Desmoulins is my friend.

639
01:00:34,946 --> 01:00:37,779
But I'll abide by your decision.

640
01:00:37,947 --> 01:00:42,989
But perhaps it would be wise
to give him an extra day

641
01:00:43,156 --> 01:00:45,281
to think it over.

642
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,532
Impossible.

643
01:00:55,116 --> 01:00:58,491
Very well. Those three
accompany Danton to prison.

644
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:10,326
We just ordered
Westermann's arrest.

645
01:01:10,493 --> 01:01:12,910
He was recruiting fighting men.

646
01:01:13,077 --> 01:01:16,119
Good. The Public Safety
Committee just decided

647
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,369
to arrest Danton
and three of his accomplices.

648
01:01:18,536 --> 01:01:20,077
Who?

649
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:21,661
Georges Danton.

650
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,828
You want to arrest him? When?

651
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:26,078
Tonight.

652
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:27,745
You're mad!

653
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:29,578
We're in a hurry.
We need your approval.

654
01:01:29,746 --> 01:01:30,912
And if we refuse?

655
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,621
You're the secret police.

656
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:34,746
You can arrest deputies
as a preventive measure.

657
01:01:34,913 --> 01:01:36,913
That's our privilege, not yours!

658
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,913
You can delegate it to us.

659
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:40,622
That's illegal.

660
01:01:40,789 --> 01:01:44,289
Not if you agree to it.

661
01:01:44,456 --> 01:01:45,581
Calm down, Vadier.

662
01:01:45,748 --> 01:01:49,540
Are you certain
you know what you're doing?

663
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,665
It's a heavy responsibility to bear.

664
01:01:51,832 --> 01:01:56,374
And one we are entirely willing
to assume!

665
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,708
- Write.
- Very well.

666
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:02,834
"We of the Public Safety Committee

667
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:06,334
and of the Security Committee

668
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:12,126
have this night agreed that Danton..."

669
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:14,044
Who else?

670
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,419
Lacroix.

671
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:17,252
Philippeaux.

672
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,170
Desmoulins.

673
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:28,046
"...all of them members
of the Convention,

674
01:02:28,213 --> 01:02:30,713
shall be arrested

675
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,338
and imprisoned in..."

676
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:35,463
Luxembourg jail.

677
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:39,755
Your signature.

678
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,256
Your signatures, please.

679
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:08,643
Lindet, you didn't sign.

680
01:04:09,436 --> 01:04:13,644
I was elected to this committee
to support our revolutionaries,

681
01:04:13,978 --> 01:04:16,395
not to kill them.

682
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,104
Gentlemen, this session is ended.

683
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,567
I said you were great
and that I'd die for you.

684
01:04:52,734 --> 01:04:57,109
I take it all back. All of it!

685
01:04:57,276 --> 01:05:00,984
I was blind as a bat.
Now my eyes have been opened.

686
01:05:01,152 --> 01:05:03,444
What are you talking about?

687
01:05:03,652 --> 01:05:06,402
What are you trying to tell me?

688
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:13,861
Robespierre came to see you?

689
01:05:15,404 --> 01:05:17,696
How do you know?

690
01:05:18,029 --> 01:05:20,862
Besides, I forbid you to speak of him.
You have no right.

691
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:22,738
I hope you heeded his advice.

692
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:25,113
No, I refused.

693
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,655
You find out we're doomed
yet reject your salvation.

694
01:05:29,823 --> 01:05:31,323
Why doomed?

695
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:34,365
If Robespierre came to see you,
the decree's been signed.

696
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:36,740
- What decree?
- For our arrest!

697
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:44,199
You're the only man alive
that monster still holds dear.

698
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:46,908
He tried to save you,
but you sent him away. It's over.

699
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,077
What are they afraid of?

700
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:05,910
They didn't mind your insults.

701
01:06:06,078 --> 01:06:09,495
But you express your disapproval
in writing. That's unpardonable.

702
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:11,203
What did you do?

703
01:06:13,412 --> 01:06:16,370
I refused to shake hands.
I pronounced my own death sentence.

704
01:06:16,538 --> 01:06:19,038
You don't mean that.

705
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:20,538
Yes, I do.

706
01:06:20,705 --> 01:06:22,955
Why did you refuse?

707
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,872
His hands are too bloody.

708
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:32,664
You could fight back.
The people are behind you.

709
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,546
Can we complete the list?

710
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,421
Renaudin,

711
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:17,921
Royer Collard,

712
01:07:18,088 --> 01:07:19,463
Segur.

713
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:21,130
Cross him off.

714
01:07:21,339 --> 01:07:22,922
Sourboul.

715
01:07:23,422 --> 01:07:25,338
Can we depend on him?

716
01:07:25,506 --> 01:07:27,047
Cross him off.

717
01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:28,340
Vinot.

718
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:30,881
Not Vinot.

719
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,090
Is that all?

720
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,799
No one else you're sure of?

721
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:37,883
That's enough.

722
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:41,008
No, we only have seven jurors.

723
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:42,758
So?

724
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,675
By law we need 1 2.

725
01:07:44,842 --> 01:07:46,258
Haven't you got 1 2?

726
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:47,551
Only seven.

727
01:07:47,718 --> 01:07:50,301
If you don't have 1 2,
then seven will do.

728
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:06,136
Add some hoodlums to the indicted,

729
01:08:06,345 --> 01:08:09,262
like Chabot, Fabre and Basire.

730
01:08:09,429 --> 01:08:11,137
The charge?

731
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:13,971
Antipatriotic activities.

732
01:08:19,181 --> 01:08:20,764
Know them?

733
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:24,431
Fabre, Chabot, Basire,
Delaunay, Guzman,

734
01:08:24,598 --> 01:08:28,598
the Frey brothers and Dedricksen.

735
01:08:30,391 --> 01:08:32,307
Round them up at once.

736
01:09:06,854 --> 01:09:08,437
Fabre?

737
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,396
Get up.

738
01:09:11,938 --> 01:09:15,938
He's sick.
Don't take him away.

739
01:10:02,237 --> 01:10:03,737
That's all.

740
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:29,199
The Public Safety Committee just met.

741
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:31,366
Lindet sent me to warn you.

742
01:10:38,409 --> 01:10:39,992
Save yourself.

743
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:50,786
Come on!

744
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,175
What do you want?

745
01:12:38,675 --> 01:12:41,341
There's money in the cache.

746
01:12:44,383 --> 01:12:45,799
Take it.

747
01:12:46,216 --> 01:12:51,216
But watch out...
our dear Republic may grab it.

748
01:13:15,716 --> 01:13:17,257
Coming!

749
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:37,549
Citizen Danton, you're under arrest.

750
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:39,757
Here's the warrant.

751
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:44,341
"By order of the Security Council,

752
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:48,341
you are to arrest the below named
and remove to ..."

753
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:50,716
I know, I know!

754
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:52,758
"Citizen Danton."

755
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:56,924
Is it still raining?

756
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:59,424
Then I won't need a coat.

757
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:03,675
Let's go!

758
01:14:16,716 --> 01:14:18,341
Citizens!

759
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:27,174
Danton has been arrested!

760
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:34,674
Danton was arrested last night.

761
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,341
The terror never ends.

762
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:39,925
We must act.

763
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,674
We too could be arrested any minute.

764
01:15:10,216 --> 01:15:12,341
Make way!

765
01:15:46,383 --> 01:15:48,299
Bourdon, go to the podium.

766
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:50,799
I can't.
I wouldn't know what to say.

767
01:15:50,966 --> 01:15:52,507
It's now or never.

768
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:55,007
Scared? Look, he's shaking.

769
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:56,257
You go!

770
01:15:56,425 --> 01:15:59,216
I'm a lousy speaker.

771
01:15:59,383 --> 01:16:00,883
Legendre, you go.

772
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:05,799
All right, I'll put down my name.

773
01:16:08,716 --> 01:16:11,257
I wish to speak.

774
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,757
Citizens, the session is open.

775
01:16:14,925 --> 01:16:16,966
Speak up.

776
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:20,133
We just learned

777
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,758
with amazement

778
01:16:22,925 --> 01:16:28,466
that four deputies of the Convention
were arrested last night,

779
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:30,424
including Danton!

780
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:34,132
Long live Danton!
The man of August 1 0!

781
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,591
I demand

782
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:40,591
that they be heard in this House

783
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:43,841
so you may decide

784
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:47,508
if personal enmity

785
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:52,132
or jealousy aren't behind

786
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,591
this monstrous decision!

787
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:21,966
Put down Citizen Robespierre's name.

788
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,924
Get down! Clear the podium!

789
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:47,466
It's not his turn!

790
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:50,633
- Whose turn is it?
- Yours.

791
01:17:52,216 --> 01:17:53,424
You have no right!

792
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:55,257
Get down!

793
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:58,175
Down with the dictator!

794
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,799
Back me up!

795
01:18:01,633 --> 01:18:04,758
It's been ages since our debates

796
01:18:04,925 --> 01:18:07,841
were fired with such passion.

797
01:18:09,716 --> 01:18:12,007
True, the question's important.

798
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:14,466
In short, it means

799
01:18:14,633 --> 01:18:19,508
are we going to put some people
above the Republic?

800
01:18:19,716 --> 01:18:21,632
Down with the Terror!

801
01:18:29,675 --> 01:18:31,675
Legendre demands

802
01:18:31,883 --> 01:18:34,466
that the accused come to the podium.

803
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:38,508
We all do!
Let's hear Danton!

804
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:44,299
You are willing to grant this man

805
01:18:45,008 --> 01:18:47,841
what you've refused to others.

806
01:18:48,508 --> 01:18:50,383
On what grounds?

807
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:57,008
Does Legendre mean

808
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:01,841
that Danton should be above the law?

809
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,383
The man of August 1 0
deserves some consideration.

810
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:08,175
We all agree!
Let's hear Danton!

811
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:14,632
The Republic

812
01:19:15,466 --> 01:19:18,882
was built by all the people.

813
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:24,508
Which of us dares to say,

814
01:19:24,716 --> 01:19:29,007
"The king's arrest on August 1 0
was my doing alone"?

815
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:33,216
No merit gives the right
to claim privilege.

816
01:19:33,383 --> 01:19:36,924
This much is certain:
For us, no one is privileged.

817
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:42,133
Hearing the accused is no privilege!
It's only justice!

818
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:45,091
Justice?

819
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:48,799
Don't you trust
the Revolutionary Tribunal?

820
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:52,632
The Tribunal is irreproachable.
We all trust it.

821
01:19:54,008 --> 01:19:56,258
We'll see

822
01:19:56,425 --> 01:20:01,591
if the Convention's firm enough
to bring Danton to justice,

823
01:20:01,758 --> 01:20:05,299
or if it contests Saint-Just's report.

824
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:09,466
We must challenge the indictment.

825
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:10,716
No, you're right.

826
01:20:10,883 --> 01:20:14,674
Never fear: France is with you!

827
01:20:14,883 --> 01:20:18,008
So Danton's partisans

828
01:20:18,175 --> 01:20:21,800
think he deserves special treatment?

829
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:28,341
If so, abolish
the Public Safety Committee

830
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:29,716
and try us!

831
01:20:29,883 --> 01:20:31,383
We're for the Committees!

832
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,175
Long live the Committees!

833
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:39,299
The eyes of the world
are upon us every day.

834
01:20:40,425 --> 01:20:44,466
We must show no weakness,
no moral cowardice.

835
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:48,591
What would become of France

836
01:20:48,758 --> 01:20:51,841
if we lost the trust of the French?

837
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,924
I want men beside me

838
01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:02,008
who are upright and fair.

839
01:21:02,216 --> 01:21:04,757
Innocence, that prime virtue,

840
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:11,716
cannot and must not
fear public scrutiny.

841
01:21:11,883 --> 01:21:13,674
Right! Bravo, Robespierre!

842
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:19,008
I propose that
Legendre's motion be rejected.

843
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:23,383
Then Saint-Just will read
the indictment.

844
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,175
Who is for Robespierre's motion?

845
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:30,841
- Who is opposed?
- Me. I'm opposed.

846
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:34,550
Have you gone mad?
If Danton falls, we're all finished.

847
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:36,966
Idiots! You'll be massacred!

848
01:21:37,133 --> 01:21:40,383
Such statements make you
guilty in my eyes.

849
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,716
What's that?

850
01:21:41,883 --> 01:21:47,383
The Convention has confirmed
its faith in the Committees.

851
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,008
Only the guilty tremble.

852
01:21:52,466 --> 01:21:56,132
This will destroy you, Robespierre!

853
01:21:56,883 --> 01:21:58,049
Ah, yes.

854
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:02,758
Now we have the standard argument.

855
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,466
But even if,

856
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:14,925
by the most obscure laws
of Providence,

857
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:22,382
a criminal's fall must bring me
down with him, what of it?

858
01:22:24,883 --> 01:22:27,883
For revolutionaries,

859
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:32,091
danger must never outweigh duty.

860
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:35,008
I never said I put Danton
above the law.

861
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,341
I never suspected you
in the least.

862
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:53,633
I wish to speak.
Silence.

863
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:07,550
For a long time,
I was fooled by Danton.

864
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,300
Today

865
01:23:11,508 --> 01:23:13,508
at last I see my mistake.

866
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:44,716
We should prove our trust
in the Committees!

867
01:23:44,883 --> 01:23:48,508
We should approve the indictment

868
01:23:48,716 --> 01:23:52,007
without hearing Saint-Just's report!

869
01:25:09,383 --> 01:25:13,008
Stop sniveling
or I'll ask for another cell.

870
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:16,008
Don't leave me alone.
I'd go mad.

871
01:25:16,383 --> 01:25:17,966
Shame on you.

872
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:20,924
I've gone to pieces.

873
01:25:21,091 --> 01:25:23,591
You are to die in five days.

874
01:25:24,508 --> 01:25:28,258
Admit it and give up all hope.

875
01:25:28,716 --> 01:25:33,674
When death is sure,
suffering comes to a quick end.

876
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:35,716
We can win the case.

877
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:38,299
No. This is a political trial.

878
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:42,257
It has nothing to do with justice.

879
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:57,174
I don't want to die.
I have a right to live.

880
01:25:59,216 --> 01:26:02,341
A man has only
those rights he can defend.

881
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:19,716
It's Georges!

882
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:10,966
I was afraid you weren't here.

883
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:12,758
Hey, there!

884
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,091
Wine for the people's delegates,
and quick!

885
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,925
Camille, you're crying.

886
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:24,841
That means you don't understand.

887
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,133
Understand what?

888
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,591
That we had
to let ourselves be jailed.

889
01:27:32,133 --> 01:27:33,008
Why?

890
01:27:33,175 --> 01:27:35,508
To open the people's eyes

891
01:27:35,758 --> 01:27:38,216
and show them what the Committees
are capable of.

892
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:45,675
There's no other way.
That's why I let it happen.

893
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:48,799
What about glasses?
We're not going to drink from the bottle!

894
01:27:50,216 --> 01:27:52,674
We don't even get glasses.

895
01:27:58,133 --> 01:27:59,633
Not bad.

896
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:03,175
The Convention approved the charges.

897
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:04,633
The cowards.

898
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,675
We're to go to the main jail.

899
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:08,049
We're finished!

900
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:11,174
Why? We still have our heads,

901
01:28:11,341 --> 01:28:13,882
our fists, teeth, claws to fight with.

902
01:28:15,675 --> 01:28:19,341
A political trial is a duel.

903
01:28:23,133 --> 01:28:25,841
If the government accuses us,
we'll accuse them,

904
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:27,966
and let the people judge.

905
01:28:30,008 --> 01:28:32,633
If we can sow doubt
in the people's minds...

906
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,633
We'll be executed anyway.

907
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
No! You forget
the power of my voice!

908
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:03,924
Now I will speak up.
The public follows me when I speak.

909
01:29:04,091 --> 01:29:05,632
But it's often fickle.

910
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:09,341
If they won't allow witnesses,
we won't talk.

911
01:29:09,508 --> 01:29:11,258
With them, we can win.

912
01:29:17,175 --> 01:29:18,133
Desmoulins.

913
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:22,674
You have a visitor.

914
01:29:22,841 --> 01:29:25,174
Who? My wife?

915
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:27,549
What is it?

916
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:29,507
Follow me.

917
01:29:38,133 --> 01:29:40,841
It's Robespierre.

918
01:29:42,216 --> 01:29:44,091
Go ahead. He'll save you.

919
01:29:44,258 --> 01:29:47,258
What are you waiting for?
- No one's stopping you.

920
01:29:47,425 --> 01:29:48,341
Go on.

921
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:51,966
We will die,
but you needn't die with us.

922
01:29:53,591 --> 01:29:54,757
What should I do?

923
01:29:54,925 --> 01:29:56,758
Go on. He's come for you.

924
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:59,341
Go, I tell you.

925
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:03,632
Please inform the gentleman
I don't wish to see him.

926
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:09,175
I can't tell him that.

927
01:30:09,383 --> 01:30:14,216
Then say, "Camille is not at home."

928
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:15,674
People of France!
Why are these swine here?

929
01:31:15,841 --> 01:31:17,466
Who dares to try me with thieves?

930
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:22,633
We, the spearhead of the
Revolution, tried as criminals!

931
01:31:22,841 --> 01:31:24,507
What's the meaning of this?

932
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:28,925
You don't have the floor yet.

933
01:31:40,383 --> 01:31:42,341
Make way!

934
01:31:44,675 --> 01:31:46,383
Wait here.

935
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:50,758
They won't shut the doors.

936
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:56,133
Keep him out.
He mustn't take notes.

937
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:58,758
Quiet, please.

938
01:32:00,841 --> 01:32:05,382
Why can't I take notes?
Has the Committee gone mad?

939
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:07,508
I'm a journalist from Rheims.

940
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:13,299
Down with the Committees!

941
01:32:15,966 --> 01:32:18,674
Chabot, Delaunay, Basire, Fabre.

942
01:32:20,216 --> 01:32:22,299
You are accused of conspiring

943
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:24,716
to bribe elected delegates

944
01:32:24,883 --> 01:32:28,133
and foster a revolt of the nobility

945
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:33,258
with gold stolen
from the East India Company

946
01:32:33,425 --> 01:32:36,966
through your crooked
financial schemes.

947
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:42,216
Desmoulins, Philippeaux and Danton

948
01:32:43,341 --> 01:32:45,799
are just as guilty

949
01:32:46,008 --> 01:32:49,508
as those whose crimes
I have just described.

950
01:32:49,675 --> 01:32:54,300
You call this tissue of lies
an indictment!

951
01:32:54,508 --> 01:32:57,216
Give it to them, Georges!

952
01:32:57,383 --> 01:32:59,633
Shall I dirty my mouth by replying?

953
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,050
We're with you!

954
01:33:02,216 --> 01:33:04,591
The accused won't reply?
No matter.

955
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,716
Let us talk!

956
01:33:09,925 --> 01:33:11,841
Nothing to add to the defense?

957
01:33:12,008 --> 01:33:15,466
What do you mean, add?
We haven't spoken yet.

958
01:33:15,675 --> 01:33:17,341
So?

959
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:21,091
Has the jury heard enough?

960
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:24,841
Why the hurry, Fouquier?

961
01:33:26,008 --> 01:33:27,841
Did I say I'd finished?

962
01:33:29,675 --> 01:33:32,508
If you hope to address the public,

963
01:33:32,675 --> 01:33:35,008
you should know:
It's against the law.

964
01:33:35,216 --> 01:33:39,591
I founded the tribunal!
I ought to know the rules.

965
01:33:40,841 --> 01:33:42,341
Very well.

966
01:33:43,841 --> 01:33:45,257
You may speak.

967
01:33:46,175 --> 01:33:47,633
For the last time.

968
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,550
Yes, the last time.

969
01:33:51,716 --> 01:33:53,507
France!

970
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:56,050
You are not allowed
to address the public.

971
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,925
For five years, I've been
your leader and your companion.

972
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:02,508
Every page of your history
bears my name. Is that not true?

973
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:05,716
Long live Danton!

974
01:34:05,883 --> 01:34:08,508
You're accused of selling out.

975
01:34:08,758 --> 01:34:10,591
Selling out?

976
01:34:11,133 --> 01:34:13,633
A man like me is beyond price.

977
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:17,382
I will clear this hall.

978
01:34:17,633 --> 01:34:20,341
Don't expect me to be cool.
I'll take all day if I have to.

979
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:23,299
My voice will be heard!

980
01:34:24,841 --> 01:34:29,174
The law bars addressing the public.
Back to your seat.

981
01:34:29,425 --> 01:34:32,216
This trial is just starting, not ending.

982
01:34:32,383 --> 01:34:37,091
The braver the man,
the harder they try to destroy him.

983
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:39,299
Go on, Danton.

984
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:41,716
Listen.

985
01:34:41,925 --> 01:34:45,008
When they decide to destroy a man,
they throw the book at him.

986
01:34:45,175 --> 01:34:48,633
An old trick, but one I see
they've brought to new refinement.

987
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,800
You dismiss the law
while claiming to serve it.

988
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:55,049
It makes those in power think

989
01:34:55,216 --> 01:34:56,924
that they have nothing to fear.

990
01:34:58,383 --> 01:35:01,174
The just have always
been an obstacle to politicians,

991
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:03,716
and today more than ever!

992
01:35:04,925 --> 01:35:08,050
Why must I be killed?
Only I can answer that.

993
01:35:09,175 --> 01:35:13,300
They must kill me because I'm honest.
Because I tell the truth.

994
01:35:13,466 --> 01:35:15,507
Because I frighten them.

995
01:35:15,675 --> 01:35:19,300
Three reasons
to murder a decent man!

996
01:35:19,466 --> 01:35:22,007
Guards! That journalist!

997
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,841
Taking notes is forbidden!

998
01:35:26,675 --> 01:35:29,300
Down with the Tribunal!

999
01:35:41,675 --> 01:35:45,216
I was among those
who established the people's justice.

1000
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,258
Do you think you can pervert it
without my noticing?

1001
01:35:52,133 --> 01:35:55,049
This is another of your tricks.

1002
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:59,216
Mixing us with hoodlums
so the people think we're thieves.

1003
01:35:59,383 --> 01:36:02,133
Congratulations! Great idea!

1004
01:36:02,383 --> 01:36:04,341
Too bad I noticed it.

1005
01:36:06,008 --> 01:36:08,508
What a parody of justice!

1006
01:36:08,675 --> 01:36:12,133
Where are the witnesses
we are entitled to?

1007
01:36:14,008 --> 01:36:16,758
People of France,
you are the Tribunal.

1008
01:36:22,508 --> 01:36:25,841
Bring in our accusers.
The Committees.

1009
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:28,299
No Committees.
You don't have the right.

1010
01:36:28,466 --> 01:36:31,841
Let it all be public,
and you decide.

1011
01:36:32,008 --> 01:36:33,674
Quiet!

1012
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:41,382
Panis, run to the Convention.

1013
01:36:42,258 --> 01:36:43,883
We want the Committees.

1014
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:46,841
Say we're being muzzled. Run!

1015
01:36:47,008 --> 01:36:48,424
Count on me!

1016
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:58,425
I'm on my way!

1017
01:37:06,633 --> 01:37:09,049
Oust the Committees!

1018
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:14,383
You call this justice?
It's a massacre!

1019
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:28,674
Why are you here?

1020
01:37:28,841 --> 01:37:33,174
You let him go on and on.
Shut him up.

1021
01:37:33,341 --> 01:37:36,216
You think it's so easy.

1022
01:37:38,133 --> 01:37:40,758
We want more energy from you.

1023
01:37:40,925 --> 01:37:43,258
Energy?

1024
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:45,216
Yes, energy.

1025
01:37:46,966 --> 01:37:52,382
Come into the court and you'll see.

1026
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:55,425
Never mind that.
We know what's happening.

1027
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:58,966
- We know what you're saying.
- And not saying!

1028
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:03,633
Spying on me? Bravo!

1029
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:06,257
Your hesitation
hardly inspires confidence.

1030
01:38:06,425 --> 01:38:08,383
What are you talking about, Billaud?

1031
01:38:12,341 --> 01:38:14,674
You don't understand!

1032
01:38:16,341 --> 01:38:19,799
They want witnesses?
Very well. They'll have them.

1033
01:38:20,008 --> 01:38:21,841
Because we can't refuse.

1034
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:23,341
No! No witnesses!

1035
01:38:24,216 --> 01:38:25,924
Fine.

1036
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:28,925
Then I guarantee nothing.
You do as you wish.

1037
01:38:29,091 --> 01:38:34,007
We really can't bar their witnesses?

1038
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:37,050
No. Not right away.

1039
01:38:37,216 --> 01:38:39,841
But you're running this trial.

1040
01:38:41,091 --> 01:38:43,632
I'm running it?

1041
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:47,008
Very well. Then get out.

1042
01:38:47,175 --> 01:38:50,133
Get the hell out!

1043
01:38:56,675 --> 01:38:59,008
Let me run it.

1044
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:34,299
Is the Danton affair
going very badly?

1045
01:39:35,841 --> 01:39:37,382
Why do you ask?

1046
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:39,258
I've never seen you like this.

1047
01:39:40,216 --> 01:39:41,674
Leave me alone.

1048
01:39:42,758 --> 01:39:45,799
Not until you've told me everything.

1049
01:39:47,508 --> 01:39:50,216
The Danton affair is a dilemma.

1050
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:54,924
If we lose the trial,
the Revolution is sunk.

1051
01:39:55,091 --> 01:39:57,591
If we win, it's the same.

1052
01:40:00,008 --> 01:40:02,341
I shouldn't say that.

1053
01:40:07,508 --> 01:40:09,883
Are they out to hurt you?

1054
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:14,133
At least not openly.

1055
01:40:17,216 --> 01:40:19,674
Please don't leave without eating.

1056
01:41:18,675 --> 01:41:21,050
- No, that's no good.
- Just sheaves?

1057
01:41:21,216 --> 01:41:25,716
There'll be lots of fruit
and carts of olives from Avignon.

1058
01:41:29,175 --> 01:41:31,216
We must evoke peace and joy.

1059
01:41:31,383 --> 01:41:33,841
Serenity.

1060
01:41:34,008 --> 01:41:36,091
A celebration of the Supreme Being.

1061
01:41:38,716 --> 01:41:40,341
Try this staff.

1062
01:41:40,675 --> 01:41:42,216
Very simple and rustic.

1063
01:41:59,591 --> 01:42:02,507
No, it's like a martyr's palm.

1064
01:42:13,216 --> 01:42:14,882
We're in trouble.

1065
01:42:15,133 --> 01:42:17,716
The trial's going badly.

1066
01:42:47,716 --> 01:42:49,299
Danton's panicking the gallery.

1067
01:42:49,466 --> 01:42:52,507
He's so sure of himself
that he's attacking us.

1068
01:42:53,758 --> 01:42:55,841
We want Danton's death.

1069
01:42:56,008 --> 01:42:59,008
Your job is to justify the verdict.

1070
01:42:59,175 --> 01:43:01,925
Silence him any way you can.

1071
01:43:03,675 --> 01:43:06,341
The public will lynch us.

1072
01:43:06,508 --> 01:43:08,133
What's more,

1073
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,841
the accused
are demanding witnesses.

1074
01:43:11,008 --> 01:43:13,049
We sent a letter yesterday...

1075
01:43:13,216 --> 01:43:14,841
I know.

1076
01:43:15,258 --> 01:43:16,841
Where is it?

1077
01:43:17,341 --> 01:43:20,174
Did you send it or not?

1078
01:43:20,841 --> 01:43:23,049
The Convention will answer it

1079
01:43:23,216 --> 01:43:25,257
after I tell them what I think of it.

1080
01:43:25,425 --> 01:43:26,925
We can't wait.

1081
01:43:28,466 --> 01:43:30,882
They'll say no in any case.

1082
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:37,549
Barere, you approve of this?

1083
01:43:44,008 --> 01:43:45,716
You can't do this.

1084
01:43:46,550 --> 01:43:50,841
Fouquier, if we back off,
we're all sunk.

1085
01:43:51,008 --> 01:43:52,841
I'm a judge.

1086
01:43:53,466 --> 01:43:56,841
I'm not your private executioner.

1087
01:43:58,341 --> 01:44:00,716
You are an executioner!

1088
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:03,841
Not mine... the people's!

1089
01:44:04,008 --> 01:44:06,508
You serve justice!

1090
01:44:06,675 --> 01:44:10,133
We send you the Republic's enemies!

1091
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:14,008
Your duty is not to judge them
but to destroy them!

1092
01:44:17,633 --> 01:44:19,258
You no longer have law on your side.

1093
01:44:20,383 --> 01:44:22,258
When the Republic is at stake,

1094
01:44:22,425 --> 01:44:24,758
we have every right.
Never forget that.

1095
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:29,258
Say another word
and you'll be arrested.

1096
01:44:29,425 --> 01:44:31,800
We'll speak of this later.

1097
01:44:32,383 --> 01:44:33,508
Later.

1098
01:44:58,508 --> 01:45:00,133
David.

1099
01:45:00,508 --> 01:45:03,716
When will you finish "The Oath"?

1100
01:45:03,883 --> 01:45:04,883
Fabre wasn't there.

1101
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,633
Come now, Maxime.

1102
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,550
I'm certain he was on the list.

1103
01:45:08,716 --> 01:45:10,716
He wasn't there, I tell you.

1104
01:45:10,883 --> 01:45:14,049
He's a traitor, besides.
Remove him.

1105
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:27,757
Are you a close friend of Danton's?

1106
01:45:27,883 --> 01:45:31,049
I demand to be identified first,
as provided by law.

1107
01:45:32,883 --> 01:45:34,424
A mere formality.

1108
01:45:35,758 --> 01:45:37,883
Like this whole trial.

1109
01:45:40,675 --> 01:45:43,216
You've already testified.
Be quiet.

1110
01:45:43,383 --> 01:45:45,466
I've barely begun.

1111
01:45:45,675 --> 01:45:48,758
This trial won't be over
until I've finished.

1112
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:52,966
People of France,
I appeal to you!

1113
01:45:53,133 --> 01:45:55,549
You and you alone may judge me.

1114
01:45:55,925 --> 01:45:58,341
Where are our witnesses?

1115
01:45:58,508 --> 01:46:00,966
I want them. Here!

1116
01:46:01,175 --> 01:46:06,341
The two Committees
must be tried by public opinion.

1117
01:46:07,008 --> 01:46:09,758
After both sides have had their say,

1118
01:46:09,925 --> 01:46:11,841
you, the people,

1119
01:46:12,008 --> 01:46:13,716
will decide who's guilty:

1120
01:46:13,883 --> 01:46:16,633
me or the omnipotent Committee!

1121
01:46:18,591 --> 01:46:22,507
Stop addressing the audience
or you will be silenced!

1122
01:46:22,675 --> 01:46:26,633
I'm accused of conspiracy.

1123
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:30,507
Very well. I confess.

1124
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:33,216
I am guilty of conspiracy.

1125
01:46:33,383 --> 01:46:37,216
In my own heart, in my own company,
I have conspired.

1126
01:46:38,675 --> 01:46:42,133
Conspired for peace, amnesty,

1127
01:46:42,383 --> 01:46:45,091
respect for the law, public order.

1128
01:46:45,258 --> 01:46:48,591
Conspired for happiness and justice.

1129
01:46:50,925 --> 01:46:52,216
These faults...

1130
01:46:52,383 --> 01:46:55,758
because apparently
that's what they are...

1131
01:46:55,925 --> 01:46:58,425
I admit to with pride.

1132
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:01,924
But I admit only to them.

1133
01:47:04,341 --> 01:47:07,799
Another fault:
being popular and strong,

1134
01:47:08,008 --> 01:47:11,133
when only anonymity and cunning

1135
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,675
guarantee one a long life.

1136
01:47:13,841 --> 01:47:17,299
If you desire a long life,
you must not be loved.

1137
01:47:17,508 --> 01:47:20,674
That's one of our new laws,

1138
01:47:20,841 --> 01:47:24,216
all the more powerful

1139
01:47:24,383 --> 01:47:26,508
for being unwritten.

1140
01:47:27,966 --> 01:47:31,049
Woe to strong men
loved by the people!

1141
01:47:31,716 --> 01:47:33,716
Long live mediocre,

1142
01:47:33,966 --> 01:47:35,466
taciturn,

1143
01:47:36,008 --> 01:47:39,341
bitter men,
huddled in their offices.

1144
01:47:40,925 --> 01:47:43,300
The Revolution is like Saturn:

1145
01:47:43,466 --> 01:47:46,591
It devours its own children.

1146
01:47:47,216 --> 01:47:49,632
Why must we...

1147
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,008
What fate propels us
to condemn rather than forgive?

1148
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:55,841
Destroy rather than save?

1149
01:47:56,008 --> 01:47:58,466
Why all this bloodshed?

1150
01:47:58,675 --> 01:48:03,091
When, if ever, will it stop?

1151
01:48:05,966 --> 01:48:09,174
I thought I could put a brake
to this storm of Revolution.

1152
01:48:09,383 --> 01:48:13,341
I thought it advisable,
and I still do.

1153
01:48:17,175 --> 01:48:19,758
But in your cold eyes,

1154
01:48:19,925 --> 01:48:21,966
I have already read my death.

1155
01:48:22,133 --> 01:48:25,508
You decided that
before entering this room.

1156
01:48:25,675 --> 01:48:29,383
I wonder: Was I wrong?

1157
01:48:32,633 --> 01:48:35,299
Other men disagree with me.

1158
01:48:35,466 --> 01:48:39,132
Their idealism knows no bounds.

1159
01:48:47,008 --> 01:48:51,258
They no longer see men around them
but only speculators,

1160
01:48:51,425 --> 01:48:53,758
villains and traitors.

1161
01:48:53,925 --> 01:48:56,175
In the name
of revolutionary principles,

1162
01:48:56,341 --> 01:49:00,091
they have forgotten the Revolution!

1163
01:49:02,258 --> 01:49:06,174
They've established
a new dictatorship worse than the old.

1164
01:49:06,341 --> 01:49:10,507
Fearing the return of tyrants,
they've become tyrants themselves!

1165
01:49:11,883 --> 01:49:15,549
Fouquier, you said
the people wanted blood.

1166
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:18,008
Lies!

1167
01:49:18,883 --> 01:49:21,841
It's not the people
who want blood. It's you!

1168
01:49:22,008 --> 01:49:25,049
The people want only
to live in peace.

1169
01:49:25,216 --> 01:49:28,799
You have no right to saddle them
with your thirst for blood.

1170
01:49:31,425 --> 01:49:35,425
Danton, you have betrayed yourself!

1171
01:49:37,133 --> 01:49:38,716
Only a conspirator,

1172
01:49:38,883 --> 01:49:40,841
an enemy of the government,

1173
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:42,674
could thus insult

1174
01:49:42,841 --> 01:49:44,966
the People's Tribunal.

1175
01:49:45,133 --> 01:49:48,591
The people have only
one dangerous enemy:

1176
01:49:48,758 --> 01:49:50,633
the government!

1177
01:49:53,883 --> 01:49:57,966
Stop the trial! Free Danton!

1178
01:50:04,008 --> 01:50:05,508
Call the guards.

1179
01:50:13,258 --> 01:50:15,174
Soldiers,

1180
01:50:15,425 --> 01:50:18,633
seven times I've been wounded,
each time in the chest!

1181
01:50:19,341 --> 01:50:21,174
Now shoot me in the back!

1182
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:24,299
People of France,
do not abandon your defenders!

1183
01:50:27,508 --> 01:50:29,424
Let me through.

1184
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:49,716
They kill freedom before your very eyes,
and you do nothing.

1185
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:06,341
Come here.

1186
01:52:06,675 --> 01:52:09,300
They've arrested you too.

1187
01:52:10,675 --> 01:52:12,508
So there is justice!

1188
01:52:12,675 --> 01:52:14,800
The creator of the Tribunals
is himself to die!

1189
01:52:15,008 --> 01:52:17,966
I will die, but so will you!

1190
01:52:18,091 --> 01:52:20,424
Spit on him!

1191
01:52:33,966 --> 01:52:38,299
How can you pack
living people in like this?

1192
01:52:43,675 --> 01:52:45,175
Danton.

1193
01:52:46,216 --> 01:52:47,716
Desmoulins.

1194
01:52:48,841 --> 01:52:50,466
Philippeaux.

1195
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:53,133
Lacroix.

1196
01:52:53,925 --> 01:52:55,508
Heron.

1197
01:52:56,258 --> 01:52:57,758
Fabre.

1198
01:52:58,383 --> 01:52:59,966
Chabot.

1199
01:53:00,425 --> 01:53:02,008
Basire.

1200
01:54:02,175 --> 01:54:03,300
Where is he?

1201
01:54:04,758 --> 01:54:06,133
Here.

1202
01:54:18,633 --> 01:54:20,508
Did he confess?

1203
01:54:24,675 --> 01:54:27,216
I never said what's written there.

1204
01:54:28,175 --> 01:54:33,050
I only did it to avoid a catastrophe.

1205
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:36,466
What catastrophe?

1206
01:54:36,675 --> 01:54:38,008
Sign the statement.

1207
01:54:39,175 --> 01:54:40,300
Sign it!

1208
01:54:40,508 --> 01:54:41,966
It wasn't a plot.

1209
01:54:42,133 --> 01:54:44,008
Then what was it?

1210
01:54:46,425 --> 01:54:48,425
Just this:

1211
01:54:48,591 --> 01:54:52,132
Lucie Desmoulins wanted

1212
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:56,925
to gather Danton's friends.

1213
01:54:57,091 --> 01:55:00,007
Such a list amounts to a plot.

1214
01:55:00,175 --> 01:55:02,466
It wasn't a plot.

1215
01:55:02,925 --> 01:55:06,341
You must sign your deposition

1216
01:55:06,508 --> 01:55:08,966
if you don't want to die.

1217
01:55:40,341 --> 01:55:45,132
We've discovered a plot.
All Paris is in on it.

1218
01:55:45,341 --> 01:55:46,424
What plot?

1219
01:55:46,675 --> 01:55:49,091
Organized by Desmoulins' wife
and Danton's friends.

1220
01:55:49,258 --> 01:55:50,841
They had the support of many.

1221
01:55:51,008 --> 01:55:53,424
Tomorrow they planned

1222
01:55:53,591 --> 01:55:55,716
to surround the court.

1223
01:55:55,883 --> 01:55:57,383
We're finished now.

1224
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:58,758
Well, Robespierre?

1225
01:55:58,925 --> 01:56:01,675
This trial was your mad idea.

1226
01:56:01,841 --> 01:56:04,841
What now, Maximilien Robespierre?

1227
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:09,425
What do you want?

1228
01:56:10,008 --> 01:56:12,674
What do you want?
- You ask us that?

1229
01:56:16,425 --> 01:56:18,550
We've won against Danton.

1230
01:56:18,716 --> 01:56:20,466
What do you mean?

1231
01:56:20,633 --> 01:56:22,174
Open your eyes.

1232
01:56:22,341 --> 01:56:25,341
You've all saved your heads.

1233
01:56:25,508 --> 01:56:26,841
You've escaped.

1234
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:29,424
- Escaped? How?
- Listen.

1235
01:56:29,591 --> 01:56:31,424
Any plot

1236
01:56:31,591 --> 01:56:34,174
is the Convention's worry.

1237
01:56:34,341 --> 01:56:37,674
If it's threatened,
it will have to obey the Committee.

1238
01:56:37,841 --> 01:56:41,716
We must move quickly
to get this decree.

1239
01:56:41,883 --> 01:56:43,383
What decree?

1240
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:48,341
Danton must be barred
from speaking at the trial.

1241
01:56:48,508 --> 01:56:52,299
Tell the Convention of this plot.

1242
01:56:53,175 --> 01:56:55,675
I can't. I'm exhausted.

1243
01:56:55,841 --> 01:56:58,841
I'll go, and I'll get the decree.

1244
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:03,758
Danton wants to call witnesses,

1245
01:57:03,925 --> 01:57:06,216
but that's out of the question.
- Very well.

1246
01:57:14,175 --> 01:57:16,091
You know we're innocent.

1247
01:57:16,258 --> 01:57:18,674
But you don't care,

1248
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:21,174
because you're following
your orders.

1249
01:57:21,341 --> 01:57:24,257
And Fouquier knows
which orders I speak of.

1250
01:57:24,425 --> 01:57:27,633
What are they? Confess!

1251
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:30,216
So I too am to taste

1252
01:57:30,383 --> 01:57:32,008
the kiss of steel.

1253
01:57:32,175 --> 01:57:34,675
But mark my words:

1254
01:57:34,883 --> 01:57:36,424
You can have my head,

1255
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:38,216
but he who gave the order

1256
01:57:38,383 --> 01:57:40,633
will soon rot beside me.

1257
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,425
He knows that if he kills me,
it will be his death as well.

1258
01:57:44,591 --> 01:57:47,632
You want to murder me
without a trace.

1259
01:57:47,841 --> 01:57:50,841
You forbid journalists to take notes.

1260
01:57:51,008 --> 01:57:55,008
The clerks sit idly by.

1261
01:57:55,258 --> 01:57:57,591
They too have been told

1262
01:57:57,758 --> 01:57:59,674
to write nothing.

1263
01:57:59,841 --> 01:58:01,841
It must all disappear.

1264
01:58:02,008 --> 01:58:03,716
Am I to vanish too?

1265
01:58:03,883 --> 01:58:05,966
No! I won't!

1266
01:58:06,133 --> 01:58:09,591
I will go on speaking to the end,

1267
01:58:09,758 --> 01:58:11,383
because I'm immortal.

1268
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:14,675
For I am the people.

1269
01:58:14,841 --> 01:58:16,882
The people are with me.

1270
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:18,508
You murderers

1271
01:58:18,675 --> 01:58:21,758
will be judged by the people.

1272
01:58:23,383 --> 01:58:26,549
I speak, and I'll go on speaking.

1273
01:58:26,716 --> 01:58:29,341
Perhaps the air
in this very hall will preserve

1274
01:58:29,508 --> 01:58:32,174
the echo of my silenced voice.

1275
01:58:34,341 --> 01:58:36,132
Delegates of the Nation!

1276
01:58:50,466 --> 01:58:53,341
I have here
the Convention's latest decree.

1277
01:58:58,383 --> 01:59:01,424
The Convention has approved
the following decree:

1278
01:59:03,383 --> 01:59:08,383
"The Tribunal is to conduct
the trial without interruption.

1279
01:59:09,591 --> 01:59:13,174
Any defendant opposing it

1280
01:59:13,341 --> 01:59:15,674
will leave the courtroom at once."

1281
01:59:18,841 --> 01:59:21,382
We have unearthed a sinister plot

1282
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:26,133
to free the accused
and end the Republic.

1283
01:59:26,341 --> 01:59:29,632
The Desmoulins woman
has spent considerable sums

1284
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,508
to buy up the people.

1285
01:59:31,675 --> 01:59:33,300
Beware, all of you:

1286
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:37,007
Agents of subversion are in this room.

1287
01:59:37,175 --> 01:59:38,800
That's a lie!

1288
01:59:38,966 --> 01:59:41,132
They want to kill Lucille.

1289
01:59:41,341 --> 01:59:45,341
If you oppose this court,
I'll have you thrown out.

1290
01:59:45,508 --> 01:59:49,174
You are all my witnesses.
Have we opposed the court?

1291
01:59:49,341 --> 01:59:51,507
Have we insulted it?
- No, never!

1292
01:59:51,675 --> 01:59:53,008
On occasion.

1293
01:59:53,175 --> 01:59:54,216
Bravo, Georges!

1294
01:59:54,383 --> 01:59:55,716
Thank God it's over.

1295
01:59:55,883 --> 01:59:59,591
Glorious Tribunal, nest of thieves,

1296
02:00:00,341 --> 02:00:02,716
blackmailers and pimps,

1297
02:00:04,341 --> 02:00:06,674
I have just one thing to say to you:

1298
02:00:07,175 --> 02:00:09,175
You're not fit to spit at.

1299
02:00:11,341 --> 02:00:13,674
In obedience to the decree,

1300
02:00:15,008 --> 02:00:18,299
I order defendant Danton
removed from the court.

1301
02:00:19,383 --> 02:00:20,508
Take him away.

1302
02:00:20,675 --> 02:00:22,300
Murderers!

1303
02:00:24,091 --> 02:00:26,382
You won't silence us!

1304
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:29,300
Remove defendant Lacroix
from the court.

1305
02:00:30,008 --> 02:00:33,216
I'll leave of my own accord.

1306
02:00:33,383 --> 02:00:36,758
Me too.
We should have started this way.

1307
02:00:38,383 --> 02:00:40,674
To hell with all of you!

1308
02:01:21,175 --> 02:01:23,550
Having been convicted of plotting

1309
02:01:23,716 --> 02:01:28,257
with Fabre and the others,

1310
02:01:28,425 --> 02:01:32,466
are they also guilty
of selling their votes

1311
02:01:32,675 --> 02:01:35,175
in a plot to slander

1312
02:01:35,341 --> 02:01:37,466
the nation's representatives

1313
02:01:37,675 --> 02:01:40,883
and destroy the government?

1314
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,091
Yes.

1315
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:49,674
We will now read the sentence.

1316
02:01:50,883 --> 02:01:55,049
"Lacroix, Danton, Heron,
Philippeaux, Westermann,

1317
02:01:55,216 --> 02:02:00,091
Desmoulins and the rest
are condemned to death.

1318
02:02:00,258 --> 02:02:05,591
Their goods are to be confiscated.

1319
02:02:05,758 --> 02:02:10,008
Execution is to take place
within 24 hours.

1320
02:02:10,175 --> 02:02:12,800
Notice is to be posted
throughout the Republic."

1321
02:02:42,091 --> 02:02:44,174
It will all collapse without me.

1322
02:02:44,341 --> 02:02:46,716
There'll be nothing but terror.

1323
02:02:46,883 --> 02:02:49,299
The Revolution is shamed!

1324
02:02:49,466 --> 02:02:50,424
Hiding your fear?

1325
02:02:50,591 --> 02:02:52,466
No! I'm hiding nothing.

1326
02:02:52,633 --> 02:02:53,966
I'm scared too.

1327
02:02:54,133 --> 02:02:58,008
I thought I could look death
in the eye, but I can't.

1328
02:02:58,175 --> 02:03:02,508
It will all collapse
in three months at the most!

1329
02:03:02,925 --> 02:03:04,716
Three months at the most.

1330
02:03:07,966 --> 02:03:09,466
No, wait.

1331
02:03:11,425 --> 02:03:12,841
I don't feel well.

1332
02:03:14,258 --> 02:03:17,383
Just when you're about
to go down in history?

1333
02:03:18,258 --> 02:03:20,008
Let him be.

1334
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:36,924
Careful, or I'll cut you.

1335
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:42,508
I remember what
old Guillotin said:

1336
02:03:43,466 --> 02:03:47,257
You feel nothing
when the blade drops.

1337
02:03:47,425 --> 02:03:50,383
Just a pleasantly cool sensation.

1338
02:04:10,091 --> 02:04:12,674
I'm a fraud. For years I shouted,

1339
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:16,091
"Long live virtue."
Then I got caught.

1340
02:04:17,258 --> 02:04:19,508
We each do what we can.

1341
02:04:31,383 --> 02:04:33,924
I was had by the civilians.

1342
02:04:35,341 --> 02:04:37,466
Hurry up.

1343
02:04:37,925 --> 02:04:40,175
I had a short but happy life.

1344
02:04:41,008 --> 02:04:42,924
I have no regrets.

1345
02:05:26,716 --> 02:05:28,299
- All set?
- Yes.

1346
02:07:26,341 --> 02:07:30,091
You'll follow me soon.
You'll be forgotten by all.

1347
02:07:30,258 --> 02:07:33,091
Your house will be razed
and the ground sown with salt.

1348
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:47,299
Show the people my head.
It's worth it.

1349
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:36,300
It's over, Maxime.
Our victory is complete.

1350
02:09:36,425 --> 02:09:39,216
The people took it calmly.

1351
02:09:41,175 --> 02:09:45,508
You must agree
to become dictator now.

1352
02:09:54,508 --> 02:09:56,091
I feel

1353
02:09:57,008 --> 02:09:59,924
that everything I've lived for

1354
02:10:00,841 --> 02:10:03,257
has collapsed forever.

1355
02:10:03,633 --> 02:10:05,299
I don't understand.

1356
02:10:05,883 --> 02:10:07,591
The Revolution...

1357
02:10:09,633 --> 02:10:11,008
has taken a wrong turn.

1358
02:10:11,341 --> 02:10:12,966
How can you say that?

1359
02:10:13,175 --> 02:10:15,008
I no longer know what I'm saying.

1360
02:10:17,966 --> 02:10:22,341
You admit a dictatorship is needed.

1361
02:10:22,508 --> 02:10:26,049
That means the nation
is unable to govern itself,

1362
02:10:26,216 --> 02:10:29,924
and democracy is only an illusion.

1363
02:10:34,216 --> 02:10:35,466
I'm crazy!

1364
02:10:35,675 --> 02:10:38,675
No, just desperate.

1365
02:10:40,133 --> 02:10:42,466
So blow your brains out.

1366
02:10:42,633 --> 02:10:44,591
Good idea.

1367
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:51,549
That would end my troubles.

1368
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,841
I just want to sleep.

1369
02:11:01,300 --> 02:11:03,675
Leave quietly when you go.

1370
02:11:42,258 --> 02:11:45,716
My brother has learned
something for you.

1371
02:11:52,175 --> 02:11:54,383
"Article One:

1372
02:11:54,508 --> 02:11:59,841
All men are born
free and equal under the law.

1373
02:12:00,008 --> 02:12:04,924
Social differences must be based
on the public good.

1374
02:12:05,091 --> 02:12:06,549
Article Two:

1375
02:12:08,425 --> 02:12:12,841
The goal of political parties

1376
02:12:13,008 --> 02:12:15,883
is to safeguard

1377
02:12:16,050 --> 02:12:18,883
man's inalienable rights.

1378
02:12:19,050 --> 02:12:20,883
Article Three:

1379
02:12:21,466 --> 02:12:26,299
Sovereignty resides in the people.

1380
02:12:27,341 --> 02:12:31,091
No group or individual may rule

1381
02:12:31,258 --> 02:12:34,258
without the express consent
of the people.

1382
02:12:34,425 --> 02:12:36,633
Article Four:

1383
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:42,591
Freedom is the right to do
anything not harmful to others.

1384
02:12:42,758 --> 02:12:46,383
Man's natural rights are limited

1385
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:49,883
only by what assures
to others in society

1386
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:52,633
the exercise of those rights.

1387
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:57,633
Only the law can set such limits."
