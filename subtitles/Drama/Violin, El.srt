1
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,947


2
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,159
Very good.

3
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,923
Exquisitely worked.
You've created a jewel, my boy.

4
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:23,231
Perfect for a courtesan or priest
to pluck after supper,

5
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,966
or polish Sundays after mass.

6
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,174
In other words...

7
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,438
this violin will never bear my name.

8
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,648
Put your anger into your work, my boy.

9
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,055
Stay with me and learn.

10
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,897
1 million. 1,600,000.

11
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,541
$1,600,000.

12
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,168
Bids to all now,
at 1,600,000--

13
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,013
1,650,000.

14
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:11,345
1,650,000.
1,675,000.

15
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,648
Is that a bid, sir?
Don't be shy.

16
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,417
All right then, I'll take it.
1,700,000.

17
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,756
1,725,000.
1,725,000.

18
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,562
1,750,000.
Thank you.

19
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,430
The bid is $1,750,000.

20
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,363
- 1,775,000 on my left.
- Mr. Morritz.

21
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,564
Please don't let me forget this.

22
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,198
1,775,000 on my left.

23
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,675
Against the telephone now.

24
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,108
Against you, sir.
1,775,000.

25
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,205
1,810,000?
1,810,000.

26
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:46,708
1,850,000.
1,875,000 on my left.

27
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,221
In the room--

28
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,482
1,900,000?

29
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,225
1,920,000 in the room.

30
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,453
Yes, I got you, sir.
1,940,000.

31
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,658
Not yours, ma'am.
Neither of yours.

32
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,327
$1,940,000.

33
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:03,670
I'll take 10.

34
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,864
Do you want back in, sir?
Is that a yes? No?

35
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:11,673
The Stradivarius now at $1,940,000.

36
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,711
1,950,000 on my left.

37
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,781
Down to you two.

38
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,816
1,950,000.
Not yours, sir?

39
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,287
Not yours?
1,950,000.

40
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,090
All done then?

41
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,558
Fair warning.

42
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,094
I'm selling now at $1,950,000.

43
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:33,292
And sold to the lady on my left.

44
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,927


45
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,536
The last sale of the evening,
lot number 72,

46
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,577
on the turntable there.

47
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,481
The star of the night--

48
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,083
and-- where is she?

49
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,485
The last violin of Niccolò Bussotti, 1 681.

50
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,989
A masterpiece of the Golden Age.

51
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,358
And, if she will give us the pleasure.

52
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,957
And here she is now,
lot 72,

53
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:10,196
the so-called Red Violin.

54
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,704
At this time the last order bid

55
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,207
is at $250,000.

56
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,037
A lot of interest here,
of course.

57
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,646
So, now let's open the floor
and who will start us off?

58
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,715
260,000.
Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky.

59
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,082
270,000--

60
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,679


61
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,575
Madame?

62
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,812
Cesca, can you still see the future?

63
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,080
Are you all right?

64
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,354
Sit down.

65
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,389
Did you call me?
I was in the garden.

66
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,325
- I can come here, can't I?
- Of course.

67
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,797
- This is part of my house.
- Of course, madame.

68
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,901
I have...

69
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:19,870
some new amulets and bones for you.

70
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:25,509
If your husband spits on them,
it will help.

71
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,814
Are you hungry?

72
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,906
Don't eat that, it's fish.

73
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,517
So?

74
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,350
Your child will be slow to learn.

75
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,986
I also have some stones for you...

76
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,486
and a key to wear around your neck.

77
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,701
My husband's tired of spitting.

78
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,224
Spitting's what men are good for.

79
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,535
A father's saliva-- the best thing he can give.

80
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,676
Cesca...

81
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,007
tell me my child's future.

82
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,881
I can't do that.

83
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,245
Don't worry about my husband.

84
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,775
It's not your husband.

85
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,256
I'm simply not able to do it.

86
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,960
I see.

87
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,995
Until the baby is born...

88
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,362
your humors are one.

89
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,493
However...

90
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,262
I can read your future.

91
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,069
No, I told you, I'm scared.

92
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,508
Come on, madame.

93
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,236
Five cards.

94
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,480
It's only the future.

95
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,985
What if it's bad?

96
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,415
I'll pretend not to see it.

97
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,947
Tell me everything.

98
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,091
The moon.

99
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,196
You'll live...

100
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:28,598
a long life, full and rich.

101
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,761
There's--

102
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,830
there's travel ahead.

103
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,543
I see...

104
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:40,237
a long journey.

105
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,452
Niccolò?

106
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,890
Leave us.

107
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,122
Close the door.

108
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,435
What is it?

109
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,437
Why do you come here in your condition?

110
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,373
- I know I'll find you here.
- What is it?

111
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,070
- I talked to Cesca.
- And?

112
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,713
She read my future.

113
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,981
Cesca! Dear God!

114
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:20,280
And the birth, she said, will be
very difficult, and painful.

115
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,854
They always are.

116
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,891
- This is no prediction!
- We're talking about me!

117
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,052
Why do you listen to Cesca?
She is our servant.

118
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,031
I have an excellent midwife,
an astrologer, a doctor.

119
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,966
They'll all be there.
It will be perfect.

120
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,438
- I know.
- How do you know?

121
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,472
I know.

122
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,212
I'm too old to be having a baby.

123
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,941
This is a violin.

124
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:28,119
- It's different.
- I still have to varnish it.

125
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,255
But there's something--

126
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,758
It's perfect.

127
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,327
Everything else here is junk...

128
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,864
worthy of a peddler,
or the trash heap.

129
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,662
But this is my masterpiece.

130
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,532
I made it for our son, Anna.

131
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,541
Our son will be a musician.

132
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,839
He'll live for music.

133
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:56,644
He'll bring us pride,
and beauty to the world.

134
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,886
I wanted to surprise you,
but you see...

135
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,788
I can also make predictions.

136
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,918
It's too big for a baby.

137
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,689
He'll grow.

138
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,408
My child will come when the moon is full.

139
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,946
Come to bed.

140
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,015
You're jealous of our relationship.

141
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,751
Me and the moon.

142
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,445
No, I'm not jealous.

143
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,047
I know you'll come back.

144
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,000


145
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,195
Master, a boy is asking for you.

146
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,630
Tell him to go away.

147
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,166
He won't, sir.
The doctor sent him.

148
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
I think you'd better come.

149
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,232
Your wife, sir-- the doctor--

150
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,297
- What is it?
- She's not well.

151
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,775
Having the baby.

152
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,270
Get out.

153
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,933
Get out! Leave me alone,
for God's sake!

154
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,238
1,650,000.

155
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,767
1,675,000.

156
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,248
Is that a bid, sir?
Don't be shy. I'll take it.

157
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,183
- 1,700,000--
- Excuse me, Mr. Ruselsky.

158
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,585
1,725,000.

159
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,449
The Stradivarius now at 1,725,000.

160
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,513
Paul at 1,750,000.

161
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,820
1,775,000 on the left.

162
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,194
Against the telephone now.
Against you, sir.

163
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,762
1,775,000.
1,810,000.

164
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,357
1,810,000.
1,850,000.

165
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,596
1,850,000.
1,875,000.

166
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,572
- 1,900,000--
- Son of a bitch.

167
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,008
- He knows nothing.
- Who? Who?

168
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:05,978
Morritz.

169
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,546
$1,940,000.

170
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,640
1,950,000 on the left.

171
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,651
All done then?

172
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,847
I'm selling now at $1,950,000.

173
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,689
And sold to the lady on my left.

174
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,168
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the last sale of the evening,

175
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,704
Iot number 72,
the star of the night--

176
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:33,872
where is she?

177
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:38,272
The last violin of Niccolò Bussotti, 1 681.

178
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,676
A masterpiece of the Golden Age.

179
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,714
If she will give us the pleasure.

180
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:47,410
And there she is now,
lot number 72,

181
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,818
the so-called Red Violin.

182
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,756
The last order bid is at $250,000.

183
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,089
Who will start us off?
260,000.

184
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,254
Good evening,
Mr. Ruselsky.

185
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,403
You must clean the violin every day.

186
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,551
Care for it well.

187
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,884
This is your violin for as long
as you're at the orphanage.

188
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,195
A curse hangs over you, madame.

189
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,863
Danger to those who come under your thrall.

190
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,567
And there will be many...

191
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,409
many.

192
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:29,003
It is a powerful card,
the Hanged Man.

193
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,813
I see-- I see danger...

194
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,116
infirmity and disease.

195
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,323
I'm sorry, but what kind I can't say.

196
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,360
There are many kinds of sickness.

197
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,484
These roads,
Brother Christophe!

198
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:15,221
You've no idea what I've endured.
And why such haste?

199
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,527
What is so urgent it couldn't
wait until my next visit?

200
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,134
We have a boy, sir.

201
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,935
You have many boys!

202
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,970
This boy is a miracle.
You'll see.

203
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,974
Vienna swarms with miracles.

204
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,009
Not like him.

205
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,567
We felt you should see him at once.

206
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,515
Does he speak French?

207
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,383
No, sir. Unfortunately.

208
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,249
All your students should learn French.

209
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,551
It's the language of music.

210
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,753
It hones the ear and elevates the mind!

211
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,377
Monsieur Poussin...

212
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,275
this is Kaspar Weiss.

213
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,218
What violin is this?

214
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,982
I haven't seen it before.

215
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,684
We've had it for 100 years.

216
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,593
Far too big for him.

217
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,495
Look at his hands.

218
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,655
He should play on a child's violin.

219
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,333
Even Mozart...

220
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,036
God rest his soul,
played in Versailles...

221
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,195
on a child's violin.

222
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,570
No shame in that.

223
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,940
Wouldn't you like a smaller instrument?

224
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,309
He seems to manage.

225
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,673
Let him try.

226
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,551
Play, my boy.

227
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,854
Play.

228
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,548
I see.

229
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,413
Monsieur Poussin?

230
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:37,394
We're prepared to offer a small sum

231
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,489
to help him in his study.

232
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:04,755
They say you're a good boy,
well-mannered and clean.

233
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,358
Glad to hear it.

234
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,790
But you don't like vegetables.

235
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,262
Is that so?

236
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,796
Yes, sir.

237
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,365
What don't you like?

238
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,865
Carrots, sir...

239
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,494
and beans and cabbage--

240
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,536
These monks can't cook.

241
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,442
They also write you've a weak heart.

242
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,478
Is that so?

243
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,378
You must have a strong heart
to play the violin.

244
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,986
Believe me.

245
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,919
And stronger still to live in Vienna.

246
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:41,892
You shall see.
Vienna is an infuriating city...

247
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,453
infuriating, but magnificent.

248
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,554
Magnificent...

249
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,922
this city!

250
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,495
Antoinette!

251
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,398
May I present to you...

252
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,270
Kaspar Weiss.

253
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,305
One of the most gifted children on earth.

254
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,570
But, Georges, we can't--

255
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,904
My wife, Antoinette Poussin.

256
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,715
Good afternoon, Kaspar.

257
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,682
How nice to meet you.

258
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,950
Go on in, I'll show you your room in a minute.

259
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,356
Georges, please.
We can't afford to keep him!

260
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,392
We can't afford not to.

261
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,768
There's something about
your playing that eludes me.

262
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,795
I've decided to analyze it systematically...

263
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,708
with a scientific method.

264
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,543
First...

265
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,111
your bowing...

266
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,372
and your left hand phrasing.

267
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,179
Your détaché, ornamentation and your taste.

268
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,519
And theory!

269
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,712
Theory, too, is important.

270
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:55,618
You need a lot more than
inspiration to play the violin.

271
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,754
You need method.
You must think...

272
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,399
and work.

273
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,763
Won't you eat?

274
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,003
You must eat!

275
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,671
Did you want something else?

276
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,706
Try this cheese.
I think you'll like it.

277
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,741
It's French!

278
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,605
- Try some.
- Taste it.

279
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:23,480
You'll see, a little different
from the monks' crumbly cheese!

280
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,521
Go on!

281
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,458
Kaspar...

282
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,426
if you play well,
you'll enjoy the finest fare.

283
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,123
We can't afford coal,
let alone food!

284
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,066
Sell your jewelry!
Sell your David!

285
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,269
Besides he voted
to behead the king, the monster!

286
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,462
My boy...

287
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,032
play well,
and there will be cheese.

288
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,873
Violin... cheese.

289
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,146
May I go to my room now?

290
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,241
Go ahead.
And sleep well.

291
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,082
Madame will assist you in your prayers.

292
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,593
Why speak French?

293
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,151
- He doesn't understand.
- So he'll learn!

294
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,265
I want them to know who taught him!

295
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,449
Good morning, Poussin.

296
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,922
I pride myself on visiting the Taufer Orphanage

297
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,924
three times a year to offer
my services as a teacher,

298
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:39,293
as a gesture of support
for those good men of the cloth.

299
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,458
This year, they called early.

300
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,469
I was skeptical, but...

301
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,336
when this child raised his bow...

302
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:53,174
when he played his first note,
well, Baron von Spielmann...

303
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,873
I knew my prayers had been answered.

304
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,906
You've unearthed another Wunderkind.

305
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,182
I've no money for you, Poussin.

306
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,953
I have no concerts to offer you.

307
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,323
It isn't the money.

308
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,195
I suggest you find another patron.

309
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,232
Must I beg?

310
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,632
Isn't that what you're doing?

311
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,671
Yes...

312
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,906
I am.

313
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,871
In three weeks...

314
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:31,177
I'm holding a private audition at my salon.

315
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,582
Prince Mannsfeld is leaving...

316
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,787
for Prussia...

317
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,879
and seeks a prodigy to accompany him.

318
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,923
He must hear this boy.

319
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,791
Three weeks.
Can you be ready? Truthfully?

320
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,698
I could be ready tomorrow.

321
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,198
Be very certain, Poussin.

322
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,428
If you embarrass me again--

323
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:56,065
I've charmed the crowned heads of France.

324
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,667
Where are those heads now?

325
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,720
Rolling in the gutters of the new Republic!

326
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,229
No, no, no, no!

327
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,063
The first phrase,
the entire section,

328
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,803
must be played staccato.

329
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:30,602
A modern style, well and good,
but let's not be crude.

330
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,809
You liked it, didn't you?

331
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,207
- Yes.
- I'm delighted.

332
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:37,908
You're going to play it
again and again and again.

333
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,714


334
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:52,021
See this? It's a clockwork
chronometer, of my invention.

335
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,964
It's called the Poussin-meter.

336
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:00,002
You will heed it with
the same deference you would me.

337
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,604
What you just played corresponds to a tempo...

338
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,643
like this.

339
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,917
Each day, as we progress

340
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,717
we shall push down this little ball one notch.

341
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:22,317
Until finally, in three weeks,
you'll be playing like this.

342
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,664
The world will be yours.

343
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,581
Antoinette, there's something
I still don't understand.

344
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,035
His violin has a wonderful sound,

345
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,410
and a lovely form.

346
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,637
Of course, it's Italian.

347
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,045
Is it very valuable?

348
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,642
Why do you ask?

349
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,121
Well, we could pay the rent,
if ever--

350
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,386
He will play divinely, my dear.

351
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,094
Can't you trust me?

352
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,628
Yes, of course I can.

353
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,497
But must he sleep with it?
He could roll over on it.

354
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,202
What?

355
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,302
He sleeps with it?

356
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,906
Straight, proud.
Lift your chin. There.

357
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:12,100
Perfect, your bow.
You're clutching.

358
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,941
Your body's stiff,
your elbow's locked.

359
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,583
I knew something was holding you back.

360
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:22,673
Something, but I didn't know what.
Now it's totally clear.

361
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:28,125
You're oppressed by your violin.
It has you completely enslaved.

362
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,390
Look at you.
There, very good.

363
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:37,794
If you want to advance,
Kaspar Weiss, you must let go.

364
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,167
What do you mean, sir?
I don't understand.

365
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,475
Antoinette tells me you sleep with your violin.

366
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,707
Tonight you'll sleep by yourself.

367
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,774
Without the violin.

368
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,818
Without your violin.

369
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,599
Thank you for coming so quickly.

370
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,636
Thank you so much, Doctor.
Good night.

371
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,315
Feeling better?

372
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,950
Yes, thank you.

373
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,817
The doctor says that your heart
must have stopped for a minute.

374
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,190
I'm sorry.

375
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,192
It's all right, but we don't
want it to happen again.

376
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:40,094
Were you worried?

377
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,897
Were you nervous about the audition?

378
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,096
It will be just fine.

379
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,799
- You know that, don't you?
- Georges!

380
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,209
I know, I know.

381
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,439
Kaspar, we want to tell you,

382
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,915
you don't have to do it if you don't want to.

383
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,111
You don't have to play.

384
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,854
I don't?

385
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,889
We can cancel the audition.

386
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,118
We'll manage, somehow.

387
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,663
It's better than making you sick, do you see?

388
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,231
You don't have to be famous.

389
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,734
No?

390
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,834
Yes.

391
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,571
Oui.

392
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,671
I'm sick.

393
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,073
I want to be famous.

394
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,602
Sir, I really do.

395
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,138
That's my boy.

396
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,378
I'm very proud of you.

397
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,579
I want you to rest, relax.

398
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,748
Madame Poussin will bring

399
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,053
a visitor you like very much.

400
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,397
Thank you, madame.

401
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,645
Good!

402
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,606
There you go!

403
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,601
We better sleep now.

404
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,477
Tomorrow's going to be a busy day.

405
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,883
Perfect.

406
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,884
And now, backwards.
Are you ready?

407
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,120
Rejected! The shame!

408
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,302
Kaspar Weiss.

409
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,599
Kaspar Weiss, violin!

410
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
Play the best you can.

411
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,676
Play your best.

412
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,867


413
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:55,170
Master Poussin and his protégé, Kaspar Weiss.

414
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,093
Closer.

415
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,193
Come closer.

416
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:18,565
So you're the wild child I've heard all about.

417
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,901
An orphan raised by monks.

418
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,599
If you prefer,
we can call in the next.

419
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,710
There's the son of--

420
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,810
No, no.

421
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,648
How charming to think

422
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:34,445
a monastery has actually produced something--

423
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,485
something worthwhile.

424
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,409
That's a lovely instrument you have.

425
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,159
May I see it?

426
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,387
May I see it, my boy?

427
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,342
Is it for sale?

428
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,308
I'd give you a good price for it.

429
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,052
He's very attached to his instrument.

430
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,152
So I see.

431
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,886
Perhaps after he's played--

432
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:17,792
Of course, let him play.
I might take him, too.

433
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,160
Come, play for me.

434
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,932
Won't you play something for me?
Please.

435
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,637
Poussin!

436
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,038
Just play for him, son.

437
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Play.

438
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,221


439
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,323


440
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,705


441
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,789
Monsieur Poussin?

442
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:32,721
On behalf of the brothers I thank you

443
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,857
for the generosity you showed Kaspar.

444
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,596
He takes with him the many gifts you gave him.

445
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,763
I did what I could.

446
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,571
Would you honor us
by sharing our modest supper?

447
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,373
It's very kind of you,

448
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,212
but my wife awaits me,
all of Vienna awaits me.

449
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:56,514
Of course, we understand.

450
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,390
I do have one question.

451
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,325
Yes?

452
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,260
The violin.

453
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
Yes?

454
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,561
What will become of it?

455
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:13,334
I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

456
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,737
Naturally you were foremost in our thoughts.

457
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,232
After all the time and energy you invested

458
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,438
it would be wrong

459
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,414
to give it to another child.

460
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,051
Yes, of course.

461
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,984
So we buried it with the boy.

462
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,488
He can play it in heaven.

463
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,861
Yes, quite right.

464
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:59,341
And then I see a time of life,

465
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,815
a time of lust and energy,

466
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:08,052
Ioosed across mountains and oceans and time.

467
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,454
Confusing, madame, I know.

468
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,658
But I see it.

469
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,699
I'm certain.

470
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,765
Yours is a Lazarus soul.

471
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,996
Yes, I see.

472
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,767
Put her through,
will you?

473
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,674
We're on hold.

474
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:44,477
You should tell her our story.
Explain its past.

475
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,151
Brother, please, she doesn't care.
She's doing her job.

476
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,515
But if you convince her--

477
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:51,722
Father Victor.

478
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,790
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

479
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,025
This is Suzanne.

480
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,127
They're just closing on lot 71.

481
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,663
Can you hear the auctioneer?

482
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,756
Sold to the lady on the left.

483
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
Yes, I can hear him.

484
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,499
Suzanne, how do I tell you when I want to bid?

485
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,498
Leave it to me, sir. Just tell
me when you want to stop.

486
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,113
A masterpiece of the Golden Age.

487
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,315
And, if she will give us the pleasure.

488
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,775
I feel helpless.
Isn't there something we can do?

489
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,954
Yes.

490
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,856
We can pray.

491
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,057
Auctioneer:...interest here, of course.

492
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,318
Last order bid at $250,000.

493
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,729
So, now let's open the floor
and who will start us off?

494
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,923
260,000.
Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky.

495
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,696
270,000.
Suzanne on the telephone.

496
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,568
280,000.
Back to you, sir.

497
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:45,245
300,000. I see you, Suzanne.
Against your caller now.

498
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,512
And then...

499
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,310
a man comes into your life--

500
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,445
a handsome man--

501
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,785
and intelligent.

502
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,553
He'll seduce you with his talent

503
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,587
and worse.

504
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,629
In short...

505
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,798
he's the Devil.

506
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,824
What a marvelous violin.

507
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,736
What do you want?

508
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,939
I was lured by the music.
It drew me across the heath.

509
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,307
Oh, yes?

510
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,309
Maybe you can go back the same way.

511
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,606
I'm your host.
This is my land.

512
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,609
Now I see, my mistake.

513
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,753
We will not be a trouble.

514
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,321
We'll be leaving here by nightfall.

515
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,355
That won't be necessary.

516
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:10,260
I'm sure we can come to some arrangement.

517
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,767
Excuse me, sir?

518
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,233
I must ask you to leave.

519
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,829
We have an invitation.

520
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,773
You can read?

521
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,276
Personal invitation.

522
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,563
- Evening, Percy.
- Good evening, ma'am.

523
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,565
He's in the dressing room,
warming up.

524
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,665
Not without me, I hope.

525
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,366
Victoria.

526
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,714
I need you.

527
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,419
I feel a composition coming on.

528
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,461
So do I.

529
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,268


530
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,377
Ladies and gentlemen,

531
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,677
if I can have your attention.

532
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,548
Mr. Pope has asked me to announce

533
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,321
that he will be performing this afternoon

534
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,480
on an antique instrument

535
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,923
of the Italian school,

536
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:53,055
which has revitalized
his affections for the violin.

537
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,789


538
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,372
I...

539
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:06,238
hope that whets your appetite

540
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,577
somewhat.

541
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,677


542
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,923
Mr. Pope, sir,
whenever you're--

543
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,860
- Oh, darling.
- ready.

544
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,825
I'd like to play for you a new composition,

545
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,850
which came to me recently

546
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,859
in a moment of...

547
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,657
inspiration.

548
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,891
'How did it come to this?

549
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:45,893
Saints in heaven,
how did it happen to him?

550
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,831
An artist who could not be denied.

551
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,594
A poet in fact.
But a murderer.

552
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,634
No.

553
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,774
Yet the looking-glass image was hard to refute.

554
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,443
His fingers and cuffs
were still ruddy with gore.

555
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:04,377
And as he watched,
in horror...

556
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,586
the speckles of blood seemed
to multiply before his eyes

557
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:13,986
like maggots on a fetid corpse.

558
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,959
And what would become of him now?

559
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:19,517
Where would he run to and where would he hide?

560
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,965
The options just then were depressingly few.

561
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,523
Indeed his mind was already racing east

562
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,871
- across the frozen continent--'
- Darling.

563
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,006
'and over the frozen steppes--'

564
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,241
Darling.

565
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,377
'back to the refuge of his childhood estate.'

566
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,413
I have a theme I want to work out.

567
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,048
''To Russia,' he heard the Cossack call.'

568
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,148
It needs to be addressed.

569
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,494
Can't you see I'm trying to work?

570
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,225
You're so selfish.

571
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,694
It was mutual inspiration I had in mind.

572
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,063
Can't you see I don't need any?
I was writing here like--

573
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,999
My love, don't be angry.

574
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,466
- Oh, please.
- You've only yourself to blame.

575
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,302
It's your beauty that summons the music.

576
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,110
And when it comes...

577
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,442
I must play.

578
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,684
Damn you.

579
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,484
Is this what you wanted?

580
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,496
Is this what you wanted?

581
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:52,976
'East-- east across the frozen continent

582
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:55,143
and over the frozen steppes,

583
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,813
back to the refuge of his childhood estate.

584
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,356
'To Russia--

585
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:04,290
to Russia,' he heard the Cossack call.'

586
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,922
- Frederick.
- My darling.

587
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:11,024
My one inspiration.

588
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,136
I have something terrible to tell you.

589
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,761
Terrible?

590
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,373
The worst.

591
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:20,243
It must be most terrible for you to tell me now

592
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,210
and ruin this perfect moment.

593
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,115
Jack has killed the minister.

594
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,418
It was an accident.

595
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:32,453
I see.

596
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,158
He's now fled to Russia.

597
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,192
Self-imposed exile.

598
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,429
I see.

599
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,465
You're leaving me.

600
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,202
I've never been there

601
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:50,173
and I don't know what to write

602
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,376
- I have to follow him.
- I can't go, I've concerts.

603
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:55,476
I know, darling.

604
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,780
Are you very angry?

605
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,817
Why should I be?

606
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,818
'Dearest Frederick,
I've just passed the church

607
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,987
near Charrington,
where Jeffrey was baptized

608
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,456
and I'm quickly approaching
the Rutherford bridge.

609
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:41,624
In other words,

610
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:42,959
darling,

611
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,994
we have parted for under 1 0 minutes

612
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,688
and already I'm lost.

613
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,730
I return to my writing

614
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,701
in the hope that these few honest words

615
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,538
- might rejoin our lips...'
- 'Darling Victoria,'

616
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:58,608
'...bring back your hands
to my shivering skin.'

617
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,576
'You trust in words
in the comfort of letters

618
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,445
in a way that I simply do not.

619
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,682
And no matter the language,
no words can convince me

620
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,884
- that you are not gone--'
- 'Frederick, my love,

621
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,919
it's Moscow at last and my very first night

622
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,044
was unspeakably dreary.

623
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:15,080
Can any one nation be quite so abysmal--'

624
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,393
- 'What is this nonsense? '
- 'Or is it just simply

625
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,429
- that you are not here? '
- 'Do not expect me

626
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,264
to sigh for your woes.

627
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,567
If everything truly is as it is
more than you say,

628
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,869
- then heed my simple remedy.'
- 'Frederick--'

629
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,971
- 'Return at once--'
- 'darling,

630
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,130
I long for your touch.

631
01:03:31,174 --> 01:03:33,109
I still seek your scent on my clothes.'

632
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,803
'Come to me now.
I will free you.

633
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:37,780
I should have pinned you to the mattress

634
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,084
when last I had the chance.
Like you were the butterfly,

635
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:43,184
I was the pin.'

636
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,322
'...embroidered together,
heart against heart.'

637
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,422
'Victoria, listen,

638
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:50,693
our moment is dying...
What is this nonsense...?

639
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,762
The music has come...
Like you were the butterfly...

640
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,696
Everything precious is passing, my love...

641
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,758
For everything I said to you

642
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,904
and everything I might ever say
could be contained

643
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,667
in these two words--

644
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,142
come back, Victoria.

645
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,236
Come back.'

646
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:13,737
Do not write to me anymore, love.

647
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,270
Ladies and gentlemen,

648
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,870
thank you for your patience and understanding.

649
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,748
Unfortunately,

650
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,112
I have just received notice

651
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,711
that Mr. Pope has been...

652
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,245
afflicted by an illness,

653
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,058
and unfortunately,

654
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,892
cannot be with us today.

655
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,627
Of course, we will refund those who desire,

656
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,158
but for those who do stay,

657
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,539
we are pleased to play my arrangement

658
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:13,405
of favorite English madrigals.

659
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,218
'Darling Frederick,
I have seen the truth at last.

660
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,833
Eternity has passed since we were parted.

661
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,868
One full week without your letters

662
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,571
and I am shriveling here
like a flower in the desert.

663
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,139
I will not suffer more.

664
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,275
I'm not reading, as well as not writing

665
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,678
and you'll miss this crucial report.

666
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,778
I'm coming back, my love,

667
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,950
by any means I can,
tomorrow morning if I'm able.

668
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,019
And then, will you forgive me, my love?

669
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:00,284
The wasted time,
my selfish folly.

670
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,425
Will you take me in your arms again?

671
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,525
And with one kiss eradicate

672
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,324
each hour apart from your embrace.

673
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,399
I long for you, love.

674
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:17,338
I long for your touch and constant heart.

675
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,373
Victoria.'

676
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:22,204
Savage!

677
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,499
Extreme, rude, cruel.

678
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,634
- Oh, not to trust.
- Victoria.

679
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:29,478
- You sluttish muse.
- Who is she?

680
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,414
- Quiet!
- Victoria, please.

681
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,573
Don't try to explain.

682
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,675
It's not your fault.

683
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,718
Or yours.

684
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,322
Victoria.
Listen.

685
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,967
'Do not despair, Victoria.

686
01:07:57,006 --> 01:08:00,305
This is the last page of our correspondence.

687
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,879
I'm only writing to let you know
of my plans for suicide,

688
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:07,676
by poison or drowning,
I have yet to decide.

689
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,412
All my estate I'm leaving to you.

690
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,189
I have some personal debts
that I intend to honor

691
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,992
but everything else
will be yours to dispose of.

692
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,322
Do with it what you will.

693
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,360
It matters little to me.

694
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,356
Regretfully yours,

695
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,800
Frederick.'

696
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
I'm dying.

697
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,438
I'm dying.

698
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,440
Do you know anything about music?

699
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,442
Have you heard of Frederick Pope?
Lord Frederick Pope,

700
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,177
composer, genius.

701
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,980
The only goddamn virtuoso
that the nation of England

702
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,815
ever came up with.

703
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:43,078
In a few minutes,
his violin is gonna be sold

704
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,087
and if I don't get there
because of your driving

705
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,187
or this goddamn traffic,

706
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,158
I'm going to lose my precious testicles.

707
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,625
Do you understand?
I'm going to be castrated.

708
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:55,459
Please hurry.

709
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,523
It's there, Duval's.

710
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,367
That's it?

711
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,565
Why didn't you tell me?

712
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,606
I need a receipt.

713
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,409
Hello.
Nicholas Olsberg.

714
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,913
- I'm late.
- Yes, you are.

715
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,187
Please don't let me forget this.

716
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,441
Olsberg, Nicholas.

717
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,182
I registered by telephone.

718
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:22,918
Check again under Pope Foundation.

719
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,958
Pope.

720
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,097
The last violin of Niccolò Bussotti--

721
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,647
Here we are.
Please sign.

722
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,172
There you are.

723
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,900
Here she is now,
lot number 72,

724
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:42,206
the so-called Red Violin.

725
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,407
The last order bid is at $250,000.

726
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,939
So we'll open the floor
and who will start us off?

727
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:51,320
260,000.
Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky.

728
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,355
270,000.
Suzanne here on the telephone.

729
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,990
280,000.
Back to you, sir.

730
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,526
300,000 at the back of the room,
thank you.

731
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,958
320,000.
Suzanne, I see you.

732
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:03,522
400,000 at the back of the hall.
400,000--

733
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,478
Darling, come here.

734
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,125
Do you like it?

735
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,768
Justice...

736
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,206
There will be a trial.

737
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,607
A great trial...

738
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,613
before a powerful magistrate.

739
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,774
And you-- you will be guilty.

740
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,086
Beware!

741
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,186
Beware the heat of the fire!

742
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,715


743
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,782
Comrade Chan Gong has come from Beijing.

744
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,693
Welcome her, please.

745
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,109
Comrades, students,

746
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:52,103
revolutionary companions-in-arms...

747
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:56,880
I give you my proletarian salute.

748
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:05,786
I congratulate you on today's grand festival

749
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,625
for which you have worked so hard.

750
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:12,225
Your cultural unit has done exceptional work.

751
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:22,704
I would also commend you
on the children's presentation.

752
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,907
It made my heart rejoice.

753
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,317
The story of 'The Three Heroic Girls'

754
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,510
was a vivid lesson.

755
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:35,353
It galvanized our historic crusade!

756
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,759
But unfortunately, some efforts

757
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,286
are less successful.

758
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:47,564
Sometimes the teacher must learn

759
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,764
from his students.

760
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,508
Give it to me.

761
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:06,910
Capitalist exploitation survived for centuries

762
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,583
yet its 'classics' are pitiful.

763
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:14,392
Foreign music is meaningless and empty.

764
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:17,065
What do they mean by 'symphony,' 'concerto,'

765
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,861
'No 1,' 'No 2,' 'No 3'?

766
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:23,639
This is empty formalism.
It speaks nothing to the people.

767
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,936
What good is making music

768
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:31,412
except to teach and inspire the people?

769
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,505
Long live Chairman Mao!

770
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,907
Overthrow the cultural establishment!

771
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:42,758
Chou Yuan?

772
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:43,825
Present.

773
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,587
Why do you teach this instrument?

774
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,195
Comrade Chan Gong,
what you say is true--

775
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,235
Louder, please.

776
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:00,865
Comrade Chan Gong,
you are right.

777
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,139
Much of Western music

778
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,178
is unrefined, worthless.

779
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,671
This is a fact.

780
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:12,153
Everything you said is true,
but the music I teach--

781
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,889
Go on!

782
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:17,049
The music I teach is revolutionary music--

783
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,287
Beethoven, Prokofiev--

784
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:21,327
Do you think so?

785
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,229
In his speech,
Comrade Li said--

786
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:27,463
Comrade Li was purged and humiliated.

787
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:29,502
Do you wish to quote him?

788
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:34,399
I didn't know.

789
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,968
I have taught for many years.

790
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,714
That is apparent.

791
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,783
We believe in the rule of many voices.

792
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,685
What should we do here?

793
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,083
Throw away that old junk!

794
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,715
Chou Yuan you must admit your guilt.

795
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:51,487
Let's challenge degenerate Western art!

796
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,821
Comrade, may I say a few words?

797
01:18:57,432 --> 01:18:59,432
Of course.

798
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:05,006
Students, comrades,
revolutionary Red Guards...

799
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,204
I'm not an authority on foreign music.

800
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,814
I have not studied like Comrade Chan Gong.

801
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,178
But in my opinion

802
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:18,927
there's nothing as beautiful
as our traditional music.

803
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:22,071
Chou Yuan also teaches the hu chin.

804
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,891
Could he not focus on that?

805
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,798
Comrade Xiang has shown her wisdom.

806
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:47,678
Put this down with the other 'great olds'!

807
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,723
To every problem there is a solution!

808
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,559
I'm sure you can discover the problems.

809
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,464
And I'm sure that you can solve them.

810
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,386


811
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240


812
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,509
Who's there?

813
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:05,711
Who is it?

814
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,875
Who's there?

815
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:13,087
Ming!

816
01:23:13,187 --> 01:23:15,451
You scared me.
I didn't hear you.

817
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:27,334
It's a mess.
I was tidying up.

818
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,529
What's that?

819
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,173
This is a violin--

820
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,475
a musical instrument from Europe.

821
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,913
- From Europe?
- Yes.

822
01:23:39,013 --> 01:23:40,248
Is it a bad thing?

823
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:44,978
No. A violin itself is a good thing.

824
01:23:45,019 --> 01:23:47,681
Here. Take a look.

825
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,329
We have to study foreign music
so we can move on

826
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,454
as Chairman Mao said.

827
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,590
Dad asked if you're coming.

828
01:23:58,633 --> 01:24:00,168
He's waiting.

829
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:03,567
Yes. Tell him I'll come to see him right away.

830
01:24:03,604 --> 01:24:05,774
As soon as I finish my... work.

831
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,371
- Ming?
- Yes?

832
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:18,983
What you see here-- don't tell anyone.

833
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:27,059
I want you to listen.

834
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,729
This will be our secret,
all right?

835
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,756
Go.

836
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,817
Ming!

837
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:02,288
- Was she home?
- Yes.

838
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:06,454
- Is she coming?
- No. She said she'd meet you.

839
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,587
What? Is she coming or not?

840
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:11,223
- I can't say why.
- Why what?

841
01:26:11,265 --> 01:26:13,401
I promised her to keep it secret.

842
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,503
What are you saying?
I'm your father.

843
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:18,333
You must tell me everything.

844
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,115
- Xiang Pei!
- Papa, don't!

845
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:30,309
Open up. It's me.

846
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,581
Where's the key?

847
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,620
Go!

848
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,831
Quiet!

849
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,642
Where is she?

850
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,549
Water! Water!

851
01:27:16,797 --> 01:27:18,797
She's gone!

852
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,536
Is this her?

853
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:07,538
Look at the date: 1937.
It must be her mother.

854
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:31,003
Chou Yuan!

855
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:33,238
Chou Yuan!

856
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,542
Chou Yuan!

857
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:46,721
- What do you want?
- Please let me in.

858
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,589
I've done nothing.

859
01:28:48,689 --> 01:28:50,689
Let me inside.

860
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:07,497
- This is for you.
- I don't want it.

861
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,979
It's for you. Take it.

862
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:23,889
It's a violin.

863
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:27,792
- A violin.
- I remember.

864
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:32,631
Do you want it or not?

865
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,936
I'm an old man,
but I'm not a fool.

866
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:38,028
Where are your comrades?

867
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,336
Are they waiting outside?

868
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:41,976
This isn't a trap.

869
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,177
I've changed.

870
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:46,337
I don't need it now.
I speak from my heart.

871
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,380
Enough!

872
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,384
And I don't need this.

873
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:57,255
It's from another time.

874
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,556
If you want it,
you can have it

875
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:03,324
or else no one will.

876
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:07,697
Do you want it or not?

877
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:12,504
I've no time!

878
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,701
No more arguments.

879
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:20,609
Take it!

880
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:27,078
I am a cadre in the Party.
Do you understand?

881
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:29,817
I can't keep it.

882
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:33,987
I love the people.
Do you understand?

883
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,210
Xiang Pei!

884
01:30:54,381 --> 01:30:56,440
I will keep it safe.

885
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:08,184
Let's go eat.
I'm starving.

886
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:12,825
Go ahead. I'll wait here.
I'm sure she'll be back.

887
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:14,867


888
01:31:34,054 --> 01:31:36,682
Auctioneer:...$1,950,000.

889
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:40,626
And sold to the lady on my left.

890
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:44,028
The last sale of the evening,
lot number 72,

891
01:31:44,064 --> 01:31:47,134
on the turntable there.
The star of the night--

892
01:31:47,234 --> 01:31:48,569
where is she?

893
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:53,038
The last violin of Niccolò Bussotti, 1 681.

894
01:31:53,073 --> 01:31:55,342
- A masterpiece of the--
- Do you see it?

895
01:31:55,442 --> 01:31:56,644
No, not yet.

896
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:59,054
If she will give us the pleasure.

897
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:03,214
And here she is now,
lot number 72,

898
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:06,185
the so-called Red Violin.

899
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,316
- And the last order bid--
- Not at all how I remember it.

900
01:32:10,357 --> 01:32:12,993
They've cleaned it up
and fixed it. It's better.

901
01:32:13,093 --> 01:32:16,187
260,000.
Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky.

902
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:18,032
270,000.
Suzanne on the telephones.

903
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:21,202
- Maybe if I heard it again.
- 280,000. Back to you, sir.

904
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:22,970
300,000 at the back of the hall.

905
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,939
320,000.
Suzanne, I see you.

906
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,674
340,000.
I have you here.

907
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:29,994
- 380,000. Mr. Ruselsky.
- The last card.

908
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,445
The last card.

909
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:44,453
- Oh, my God!
- Courage, madame.

910
01:32:44,491 --> 01:32:46,360
Upside down.

911
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:49,122
At this point in the spread

912
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:51,654
it might be good news.

913
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:56,468
I feel--

914
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:00,600
I feel the fast air sweeping around you...

915
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:03,201
carrying you--

916
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,008
furious wind--

917
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:08,046
and then stopping.

918
01:33:15,489 --> 01:33:20,290
Your journey will end.
No question. I see it.

919
01:33:20,327 --> 01:33:24,696
One way or another,
your travels are over.

920
01:33:27,434 --> 01:33:31,131
And there is trouble in this--

921
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:33,171
like always.

922
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,278
But you--

923
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,642
you are strong by now--

924
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:43,172
strong like a tree in the forest.

925
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,549
Where is he?

926
01:33:45,586 --> 01:33:47,586
Upstairs.

927
01:33:54,361 --> 01:33:56,096
You are not alone.

928
01:33:56,196 --> 01:34:00,758
A crowd of faces,
friends and family,

929
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,770
enemies, lovers.

930
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:07,467
You will attract many admirers

931
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:09,874
fighting to win your hand.

932
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,813
And money--

933
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:15,040
Iots of money.

934
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:16,951
No, madame.

935
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,747
Don't be afraid.

936
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:22,654
In this card I see...

937
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,784
I see...

938
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:28,659
a rebirth.

939
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:32,933
- And how was your flight?
- Very good. On time.

940
01:34:33,033 --> 01:34:34,969
Sorry to cut your holiday short.

941
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:37,004
It's quite all right.
I'm excited actually.

942
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,039
- Like Christmas.
- It won't take too long.

943
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:41,275
We already divided them up and assessed them.

944
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,977
- Right. Ballpark.
- And all that they want

945
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:44,979
- is for you to confirm it.
- I got it.

946
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,013
A second opinion.

947
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:48,048
I've done this sort of thing before.

948
01:34:48,148 --> 01:34:50,248
Can't wait to see it,
actually.

949
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,386
This is Mr. Morritz.
You know--

950
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:58,525
So, you're the expert?

951
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:01,059
From New York.

952
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:03,495
Do you know what you're doing?

953
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,199
Yes, New York.

954
01:35:05,299 --> 01:35:06,700
Do you know what you're doing?

955
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,701
Oh.

956
01:35:07,801 --> 01:35:10,292
Why yes.
I certainly hope so.

957
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:12,606
These people from Duval's
have given us some figures

958
01:35:12,706 --> 01:35:16,540
and we have figures from
the government of China.

959
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:18,577
What we need now is--

960
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:20,579
Professional opinion.

961
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,614
No, a signed affidavit.

962
01:35:22,649 --> 01:35:24,649
That's what I'm here for.

963
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:26,744
Show me to the Strad.

964
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:29,623
- They all look the same to me.
- But they're not.

965
01:35:29,723 --> 01:35:31,592
Please don't let me forget this.

966
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,717
Over there.

967
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:42,935
Here she is.

968
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:44,970
It's a beautiful specimen.

969
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:50,676
I'd say about...

970
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:53,976
1683.

971
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:55,549
Reminds me of the Cobet.

972
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,785
These are the best quality pieces we found.

973
01:35:57,885 --> 01:35:59,053
And here--

974
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,755
over here, if you'd like to take a look,

975
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:03,390
are the less promising entries.

976
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:05,490
Some of them are pretty bad.

977
01:36:07,995 --> 01:36:10,486
So I see.

978
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:12,166
I guess I'll leave it to you.

979
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:16,532
I've taken care of the luggage.
I have a driver waiting.

980
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:18,570
I shouldn't be long.

981
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,707
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, Mr. Morritz.

982
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:56,010
Everything is ready as you asked for, I hope.

983
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:58,278
- Same room as always?
- We have the same room

984
01:36:58,378 --> 01:37:00,047
but one story down.

985
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,082
If it's not the same floor,
it's not the same room, is it?

986
01:37:02,182 --> 01:37:04,518
No, sir. But it's the same as the other one.

987
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:07,485
Oh, sir,
I have a message from your wife.

988
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,521
Merci.

989
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:22,462
Room 2703.

990
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:24,562
New York City, please.

991
01:37:25,672 --> 01:37:28,368
316-2799.

992
01:37:31,945 --> 01:37:34,311
Carrie, Charles Morritz here.

993
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:37,451
I have a little gumshoe work
I need you to get onto.

994
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:39,746
Cremona. Bussotti.

995
01:37:39,786 --> 01:37:41,786
Get a pen.

996
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:50,204
Made a cast of this after we set the table.

997
01:37:51,598 --> 01:37:53,333
The Swiss--

998
01:37:53,433 --> 01:37:54,501
so here we are.

999
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,831
Here's the before picture.

1000
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,072
Take a look at the corners.

1001
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:00,441
Not too bad. I don't think
we have to touch them.

1002
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,907
Some really nice purfling here.

1003
01:38:04,878 --> 01:38:06,713
A lot of work to get it this far.

1004
01:38:06,813 --> 01:38:09,049
Turn-of-the-century hack job
with some horse glue

1005
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:11,285
and a patch,
so I had to reset the neck.

1006
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:14,718
That was the big job.
Sound post, tailpiece,

1007
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:16,924
new bridge, of course.
But the body itself

1008
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:19,893
is remarkably good.
I'm just gonna clean it up,

1009
01:38:19,993 --> 01:38:23,053
- strip back some varnish--
- No, no. No.

1010
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:24,064
No what?

1011
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:27,725
I told you before,
don't touch the varnish.

1012
01:38:27,768 --> 01:38:30,604
- That's not gonna be easy.
- If there's a problem,

1013
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:32,704
I'll do it myself.

1014
01:38:34,308 --> 01:38:36,776
Look, the auction's in two weeks.

1015
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:38,812
I have 1 6 other instruments.
Leroux's all over my ass.

1016
01:38:38,912 --> 01:38:40,948
I still have a Steiner I haven't even touched.

1017
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:43,250
I want complete LIGs,
a resonance test,

1018
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,153
mass specs and let's get some varnish samples

1019
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,687
all to the lab, okay?

1020
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:53,020
This instrument is not a priority.

1021
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:55,255
Every minute of my day is full.

1022
01:38:55,295 --> 01:38:56,797
That's fine.

1023
01:38:56,897 --> 01:38:59,417
We'll do this after hours,
all right?

1024
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,205
- These are the estimates?
- No, the reserves.

1025
01:39:10,244 --> 01:39:12,012
That we propose to the Chinese?

1026
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:16,071
- Right.
- And what about these?

1027
01:39:16,116 --> 01:39:18,051
Those are some contentious items

1028
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:20,087
you might not want to put on the block.

1029
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:23,407
They're badly preserved and hard to attribute.

1030
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,020
What about that red one?

1031
01:39:26,059 --> 01:39:27,327
The red one?

1032
01:39:27,427 --> 01:39:30,647
Leroux seemed to think it might be a Bussotti.

1033
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:34,394
Yes.

1034
01:39:34,434 --> 01:39:35,936
It might be.

1035
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:39,006
But the label's obscure and the varnish is odd.

1036
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:40,841
It's slightly opaque.

1037
01:39:40,941 --> 01:39:44,604
And I'm afraid as it stands
with no documentation--

1038
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:46,645
And that's all you expect?

1039
01:40:04,731 --> 01:40:09,065
'With all my heart.'

1040
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,635
You ever heard of the Red Violin?

1041
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:19,737
Sure, sure-- what--

1042
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,816
the Frederick Pope Bussotti?
Sure, I heard stories.

1043
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:24,751
How about copies?

1044
01:40:24,851 --> 01:40:26,853
There's one in London,
the only one I know of--

1045
01:40:26,953 --> 01:40:30,047
supposed to be copy commissioned by Pope.

1046
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:33,787
- You know who has it?
- Some private collection.

1047
01:40:34,961 --> 01:40:39,864
You think I could...
buy it without tipping them off?

1048
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:42,664
Tipping them off to what?

1049
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,638
We know for sure we have a Bussotti.

1050
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:46,073
I can date it within the year.

1051
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,076
We still have this varnish
that doesn't configure

1052
01:40:49,176 --> 01:40:51,111
but we run some comparison tests

1053
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:54,305
and see if this is the source of the copy.

1054
01:40:57,084 --> 01:41:00,576
You know I should probably tell my employer?

1055
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,823
If what you're saying is any way true

1056
01:41:02,923 --> 01:41:06,188
people could get a little...
excited.

1057
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:08,428
You know I could lose my job over this?

1058
01:41:08,528 --> 01:41:11,520
Yes, I know.

1059
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,863
You can go if you want to.

1060
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:15,900
I can finish this myself.

1061
01:41:40,193 --> 01:41:44,393
Madame Leroux says that she has
to have catalog proofs today.

1062
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,467
Are you finished?

1063
01:41:47,567 --> 01:41:50,195
Yes, they're back at my hotel.

1064
01:41:50,237 --> 01:41:52,237
I've been working at night.

1065
01:41:54,941 --> 01:41:56,941
Is there something else?

1066
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:58,977
Oh.

1067
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:02,946
Your wife called again.

1068
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:05,042
Close the door, please.

1069
01:42:14,961 --> 01:42:17,987
Yes, is this the University of Montreal?

1070
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:21,181
May I have the archeology department, please?

1071
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:28,104
Hi, this is Charles Morritz over at Duval's.

1072
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:31,151
I sent you some varnish samples on Tuesday.

1073
01:42:32,712 --> 01:42:36,142
Yeah, I wanted you
to isolate an organic compound.

1074
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:03,007


1075
01:43:06,546 --> 01:43:08,546


1076
01:43:12,052 --> 01:43:14,052


1077
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:16,821
Excuse me.

1078
01:43:21,595 --> 01:43:24,223
May I have the manager, please?

1079
01:43:24,264 --> 01:43:26,391
Yes, the manager.

1080
01:43:26,433 --> 01:43:28,433
Well fine, put him on.

1081
01:43:30,504 --> 01:43:34,270
Yes, this is Mr. Morritz in 2703.

1082
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:36,977
Listen, I want to make something
absolutely clear.

1083
01:43:37,077 --> 01:43:39,413
I don't want anyone coming to my room.

1084
01:43:39,513 --> 01:43:40,447
You understand?

1085
01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:43,448
Not the maid.
Not to check the minibar.

1086
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:45,483
No chocolates on the pillow.

1087
01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:48,755
I'm giving your staff
sort of a break, understand?

1088
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:51,119
No one is to come in my room

1089
01:43:51,157 --> 01:43:53,157
unless I request it.

1090
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:56,261
Thank you.

1091
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:13,511


1092
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:19,145
- Yes.
- I got it.

1093
01:44:19,185 --> 01:44:21,915
It's coming.
I just talked to London.

1094
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:23,890
Well, you know,
a little bit of smooth talk

1095
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:26,720
and a little bit more money.
Your money.

1096
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:30,341
You better make those phone calls.

1097
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:34,962
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
me too.

1098
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:37,367
Well, actually--

1099
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:53,051
- Wonderful.
- Yes.

1100
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:55,145
I have the recording.

1101
01:44:55,188 --> 01:44:57,123
Pretty good Strad,
don't you think?

1102
01:44:57,223 --> 01:44:59,392
I feel a little bit tight on the top.

1103
01:44:59,492 --> 01:45:02,427
A little bit stronger over the break.

1104
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:05,920
To me it's very clean,
precise.

1105
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:09,697
Of course, it would
have to be played by a master.

1106
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:11,304
What do you guess?

1107
01:45:11,404 --> 01:45:15,101
- 1.7, 1.8 million.
- Not bad.

1108
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:17,744
- Trust me on this.
- What else do you have?

1109
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:20,380
That's about it.
But thanks for coming.

1110
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,549
I hope you don't have an orchestra waiting.

1111
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,914
They can wait.
They can wait, no problem.

1112
01:45:28,188 --> 01:45:30,850
What about this here?

1113
01:45:30,890 --> 01:45:34,087
No, not that one.

1114
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:38,086
- Nice little piece.
- But not for you.

1115
01:45:39,432 --> 01:45:42,560
- I will try it.
- No, no, no. Don't play it.

1116
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:44,729
- Why not?
- Yes, why not?

1117
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:47,641
I've just repaired it.
It's still fragile.

1118
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:49,576
I don't even know why it's here.

1119
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,611
I'll be very gentle.
Don't worry.

1120
01:46:45,765 --> 01:46:48,495
Yes. I see what you mean.

1121
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:50,535
Nothing special.

1122
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:01,279
How's it going?

1123
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:06,953
What do you want me to do
with that one, the Pope copy?

1124
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:10,079
I'll take it back to the hotel.

1125
01:47:10,123 --> 01:47:13,763
You got your money's worth.
That is a very good copy.

1126
01:47:13,793 --> 01:47:15,852
Nice violin,

1127
01:47:15,895 --> 01:47:18,728
but nothing like this one.

1128
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:20,166
This...

1129
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:23,758
is the single most perfect acoustic machine

1130
01:47:23,803 --> 01:47:26,135
I have ever seen.

1131
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:30,575
Amazing.

1132
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:42,687
Guess I never thought I'd find it.

1133
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:50,426
The ultimate...
thing as I see it.

1134
01:47:52,499 --> 01:47:55,093
The perfect marriage

1135
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,135
of science

1136
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:59,170
and beauty.

1137
01:47:59,906 --> 01:48:01,906
Impossible.

1138
01:48:04,577 --> 01:48:06,577
Now what?

1139
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:12,277
What do you do when the thing
you most wanted so...

1140
01:48:12,318 --> 01:48:14,154
perfect...

1141
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:16,381
just comes?

1142
01:48:22,962 --> 01:48:24,798
Do you have children?

1143
01:48:24,898 --> 01:48:26,332
Huh?

1144
01:48:26,432 --> 01:48:28,662
Children.
You have any?

1145
01:48:28,701 --> 01:48:30,704
No, no, I don't,
but I know what you mean.

1146
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:34,433
I would love to have this baby for myself.

1147
01:48:34,474 --> 01:48:35,875
Really?

1148
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:38,773
What would you do?

1149
01:48:38,812 --> 01:48:42,441
Take it apart.
Find out how it works.

1150
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:45,585
Take some igonmode readings
on the individual plates.

1151
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:49,746
- I don't think you get it.
- Oh, yes, yes I do.

1152
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:52,257
Take a look at this.

1153
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:56,228
This is mode one,
.06 kHz.

1154
01:48:56,262 --> 01:48:58,662
Watch the response curve here.

1155
01:49:02,802 --> 01:49:05,168
I'll ease it up slowly for you.

1156
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:13,237
Mode two.

1157
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:20,145
Stop it.

1158
01:49:24,791 --> 01:49:27,225
- Bonjour, Mr. Morritz.
- Bonjour.

1159
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:31,040
I have an envelope for you
from University of Montreal.

1160
01:49:32,532 --> 01:49:35,502
This says this arrived at 7:00,
I was in my room.

1161
01:49:35,602 --> 01:49:37,203
Yes, sir.

1162
01:49:37,303 --> 01:49:39,303
Why wasn't I notified?

1163
01:49:39,305 --> 01:49:40,640
You told us not to disturb you.

1164
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,443
- Not for a courier.
- I didn't know, sir.

1165
01:49:43,543 --> 01:49:47,213
If a courier comes, you call me.
If a fax comes, you call me.

1166
01:49:47,313 --> 01:49:49,349
- Yes.
- It's important, do you get it?

1167
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:52,051
You knock on my door and you put it in my hand.

1168
01:49:52,151 --> 01:49:54,210
Comprende?

1169
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,089
I need you to acknowledge.

1170
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:58,189
Yes.

1171
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:03,628
This is my business!

1172
01:53:47,086 --> 01:53:48,187


1173
01:53:48,287 --> 01:53:50,881
Mr. Morritz, I'm sorry.

1174
01:53:50,923 --> 01:53:54,160
You'd better come up.
I'm-- they're waiting for you.

1175
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,260
All right.

1176
01:54:00,266 --> 01:54:03,167
So nice of you to join us.

1177
01:54:03,202 --> 01:54:05,138
I hope you don't mind us starting without you,

1178
01:54:05,238 --> 01:54:07,206
but there was the question
of some unusual expenses,

1179
01:54:07,306 --> 01:54:10,298
both here in the office

1180
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:12,343
and at the hotel.

1181
01:54:12,378 --> 01:54:15,581
- Did you check my minibar too?
- It is our card. We are paying.

1182
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,617
You made me wonder what was going on down here,

1183
01:54:17,717 --> 01:54:19,852
so we decided to come down and have a look,

1184
01:54:19,952 --> 01:54:22,147
and my, you have been busy,

1185
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:24,486
amidst the courier bills

1186
01:54:24,524 --> 01:54:26,125
and DNA tests.

1187
01:54:26,225 --> 01:54:28,225
Very curious procedures.

1188
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:30,525
Leroux has a theory.

1189
01:54:30,563 --> 01:54:32,656
Tell me if she's wrong.

1190
01:54:38,437 --> 01:54:42,874
Is our little red violin,
'The Red Violin'?

1191
01:54:49,849 --> 01:54:50,950
Yes.

1192
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:53,075
I just wanted to be sure

1193
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:54,420
before I told you.

1194
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:57,683
This is very good news.

1195
01:54:57,723 --> 01:55:00,248
I'll set up a press release.

1196
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:06,160
Good work.

1197
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:08,034
Thank you.

1198
01:55:08,134 --> 01:55:10,636
Why don't you take these last few days off?

1199
01:55:10,736 --> 01:55:13,170
Before you go home.

1200
01:55:18,477 --> 01:55:20,146
No.

1201
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:22,646
No, I won't forget.

1202
01:55:23,816 --> 01:55:25,017
He lied.

1203
01:55:25,117 --> 01:55:29,451
He lied to me. And I knew it
as soon as I saw it.

1204
01:55:29,488 --> 01:55:31,615
And I said it.

1205
01:55:32,658 --> 01:55:36,059
This instrument should be mine.

1206
01:55:37,997 --> 01:55:39,997
Son of a bitch.

1207
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:37,823
Ladies and gentlemen,

1208
01:56:37,923 --> 01:56:40,391
Duval's would like to welcome you

1209
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:42,261
to this eagerly awaited event.

1210
01:56:42,361 --> 01:56:45,853
Our thanks to the government of China

1211
01:56:45,898 --> 01:56:49,800
for entrusting us
with this marvelous collection.

1212
01:56:49,835 --> 01:56:52,463
Thanks too to Madame Leroux,

1213
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:56,134
who organized and made possible this auction.

1214
01:56:56,175 --> 01:56:59,576
Let me remind you that the conditions of sale

1215
01:56:59,612 --> 01:57:01,612
are listed in the catalog.

1216
01:57:01,614 --> 01:57:03,549
Before we begin, it is my duty to direct you

1217
01:57:03,649 --> 01:57:05,649
to the conditions of sale

1218
01:57:05,651 --> 01:57:07,587
that you'll find at the front of the catalog.

1219
01:57:07,687 --> 01:57:09,622
I will not read them out loud at this point

1220
01:57:09,722 --> 01:57:12,213
but consider yourselves warned.

1221
01:57:13,259 --> 01:57:15,461
Now ladies and gentlemen,
we'll begin with lot number one.

1222
01:57:15,561 --> 01:57:17,430
Showing on the turntable on my right,

1223
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:19,623
a fine French cello.

1224
01:57:19,665 --> 01:57:22,828
I'm gonna start with $1 0,000.

1225
01:57:22,868 --> 01:57:25,132
$1 0,000.

1226
01:57:54,133 --> 01:57:56,601
- Anything else?
- No.

1227
01:57:56,635 --> 01:57:59,035
- Which airport, sir?
- Dorval.

1228
01:58:04,677 --> 01:58:07,271
There is one stop we have to make.

1229
01:58:10,449 --> 01:58:11,784
$400,000 at the back of the room.

1230
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:14,216
The Stradivarius now at 400,000.

1231
01:58:14,253 --> 01:58:17,381
Against the telephone, 420,000.
450,000.

1232
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,653
Against you, sir.

1233
01:58:19,692 --> 01:58:23,355
500,000 back to the front.
500,000.500,000.

1234
01:58:23,396 --> 01:58:24,864
Wait here,
I'll just be a minute.

1235
01:58:24,964 --> 01:58:26,899
I might have to go around the block.

1236
01:58:26,999 --> 01:58:29,160
All right, if you have to.

1237
01:58:36,108 --> 01:58:39,202
1,100,000.
1,100,000.

1238
01:58:39,245 --> 01:58:40,546
1,200,000.

1239
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:42,348
Is that a bid, sir?
Don't be shy.

1240
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:44,717
All right then, I'll take it.
1,300,000.

1241
01:58:44,817 --> 01:58:46,552

1242
01:58:46,652 --> 01:58:48,962
1,500,000.
Yes, sir, I've got you.

1243
01:58:48,988 --> 01:58:51,684
$1,600,000.
1,600,000.

1244
01:58:51,724 --> 01:58:54,488
Not you, sir?
1,650,000.

1245
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:56,128
1,675,000.

1246
01:58:56,228 --> 01:58:58,364
- Not yours, ma'am.

1247
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:01,058
Please don't let me forget this.

1248
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:03,969
Against the telephone now.
Against you, sir.

Thank you.

1257
01:59:21,754 --> 01:59:24,746
Not yours, ma'am.

1259
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:30,262
Son of a bitch.

1260
01:59:30,362 --> 01:59:31,797
I'll take 10,000,000.

1261
01:59:31,897 --> 01:59:34,161
You want back in, sir?

1262
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,327
Is that a yes?
No.

1263
01:59:36,368 --> 01:59:39,565
The Stradivarius now at $1,940,000.

1264
01:59:39,605 --> 01:59:41,766

Against you all in the room.

01:59:47,179 --> 01:59:48,948
Is that all then?

1268
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:51,107
Fair warning.

1269
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:52,451
1,950,000 on my left.

1270
01:59:52,551 --> 01:59:56,681
Down to you two now.
1,950,000.

1271
01:59:56,722 --> 01:59:58,986
Not yours, sir?
Not yours, Paul?

1272
01:59:59,024 --> 02:00:01,024
The bid is 1,950,000.

1273
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:03,262
- Did you clean this?
- Against you all in the room.

1274
02:00:03,362 --> 02:00:04,864
- Who's responsible for--
- The Stradivarius now

1275
02:00:04,964 --> 02:00:06,499
at 1,950,000.

1276
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:08,667
- I have to get the last lot.
- All done then.

1277
02:00:08,767 --> 02:00:10,069
- I come to fix--
- Excuse me--

1278
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:12,104
- --I asked the client--
- What's going on?

1279
02:00:12,204 --> 02:00:15,196
- We're gonna have to--

1282
02:00:26,619 --> 02:00:27,920
on the turntable there.

1283
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:31,456

1284
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:32,758

02:00:32,858 --> 02:00:35,691
of Niccolò Bussotti, 1 681.
A master--

1286
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:37,992
I put the tag on myself!

1287
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:40,430
If she will give us the pleasure.

1288
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:42,466
Too late.

1289
02:00:43,135 --> 02:00:45,399
Here she is now,

So, we'll open the floor
and who will start us off?

1294
02:00:55,881 --> 02:00:58,349
260,000.
Good evening, Mr. Ruselsky.

1295
02:00:58,384 --> 02:01:00,252
270,000.
Suzanne on the telephone.

1296

1303
02:01:17,169 --> 02:01:18,938
- stop it.

1321
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:07,150
Mr. Morritz!

02:02:08,687 --> 02:02:10,556
Excuse me.

1323
02:02:10,656 --> 02:02:12,591
Is this what you're looking for?

1324
02:02:12,691 --> 02:02:16,422
- Down to you two. 2,200,000.

Merci.

$2,400,000.

1331
02:02:33,846 --> 02:02:35,846
Is that all then?

1332
02:02:37,716 --> 02:02:40,549
2,400,000.

1333
02:02:47,292 --> 02:02:50,159
- Let him have it.
- All done then.

1334
02:02:50,195 --> 02:02:52,598
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes. Take me home.

1335
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:55,929
Right away.

1336
02:02:55,968 --> 02:02:57,136
Fair warning.

1337
02:02:57,236 --> 02:03:01,502
I'm selling now at $2,400,000--

1338
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:05,476
and sold to Mr. Ruselsky.

1339
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:08,173
Congratulations.

1340
02:03:32,204 --> 02:03:34,866
Hey, baby, it's me.

1341
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:39,410
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

1342
02:03:39,445 --> 02:03:41,445
Yes.

1343
02:03:42,147 --> 02:03:44,147
Yes.

1344
02:03:44,183 --> 02:03:47,152
Yes, I wanted to.
Every day but--

1345
02:03:47,186 --> 02:03:49,780
Well, something came up

1346
02:03:49,822 --> 02:03:53,280
but it's over now and I'm coming home.

1347
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:58,022
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, may I speak to her?

1348
02:04:00,666 --> 02:04:03,157
Hi, honey.
It's Daddy.

1349
02:04:03,202 --> 02:04:05,432
How are you?

1350
02:04:05,471 --> 02:04:09,032
Oh, I miss you too.

1351
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:11,167
I'm coming home.

1352
02:04:11,210 --> 02:04:12,611
And, honey,

1353
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:15,511
I'm bringing you something very special.

1354
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:23,054
Madame?

1355
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:24,890
Are you all right?

1356
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,990
Is everything all right?

1357
02:04:30,662 --> 02:04:32,662
Yes. I'm sorry.

1358
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:37,592
You have the visions.

1359
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:42,639
No. I'd better go now.

1360
02:04:42,674 --> 02:04:44,674
My husband.

1361
02:04:45,911 --> 02:04:48,505
Of course.
Go to your husband.

1362
02:04:54,186 --> 02:04:56,186
Thanks, Cesca.
