1
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,388
Hit me.

2
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,820
I'm serious.
I can't feel anything.

3
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,949
Hit me.

4
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:36,461
Again!
Do it harder!

5
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:38,464
Oww!

6
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,125
I can't feel anything!

7
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,202
This is so awesome!

8
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,939
I hear this little "wah-wah-wah"
inside my head.

9
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:50,942
That's your brain cells popping.

10
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,306
- Do it.
- You want me to do it?

11
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,555
No, no, no.

12
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,350
Hit me!

13
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,049
Harder! Punch me!

14
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,626
- Ohh!

15
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,628
Oww.

16
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,805
Hit me really hard.
Really.

17
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,465
- Okay. I'm gonna plunk you.
- Okay! Go!

18
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:23,509
- Aah!
- Oh, shit!

19
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,738
Oh! Oh, fuck!

20
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,077
Yeah!

21
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,861
Come on, Hampton.

22
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,932
Come on.

23
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,342
- Come on, baby!

24
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,346
]

25
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,007
Mom! Come on, it's 7:45.
Let's go, let's go.

26
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,019
I'm ready. Hey, Noel.

27
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,020
- Mason, come on!
- Come on, Mason!

28
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:11,024
- Where's the new backpack?
- It's already in the back seat.

29
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:14,857
Hey, wait. Let me fix this before
somebody gives you the wedgie from hell.

30
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,863
- Thank you.
- Mason!

31
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:18,932
What's up, guys? Hey, Noel.

32
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:30,977
- Bitch.
- What the hell?

33
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,977
- Annette!

34
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,981
Annette,you know
you're not allowed to wear that.

35
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,984
The teachers look mean here.

36
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,986
I promised myself I wouldn't get
anything lower than an "A." Careful.

37
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,148
- Puta.
- God!

38
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,918
How you doin', man?

39
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,959
Mason, guess what just happened.

40
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,655
- Ooh! Look at that shit! Damn!

41
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,630
- That shit is tight!
- Mason.

42
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,463
Hey. Um, guys,
this is my little sister.

43
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,502
Hi.

44
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,732
Look over there.
Man, there's Evie Zamora.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,070
- Looks like she grew up this summer.
- No shit.

46
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,145
-  What's up, girl?

47
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,237
- Let's go say hi.
- Hey, be cool, dude.

48
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:10,750
What's up, Evie?
Come over here! We wanna talk to you!

49
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,478
- What's poppin'with you, girl?

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,455
- Damn!

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,791
Shit!

52
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,796
Now look up at me.

53
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,799
Oh, looks great.
Yeah.

54
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,666
Next time we'll do orange.
Hair gel, baby.

55
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:45,082
It's okay, Mom.

56
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,710
You can borrow mine... again.

57
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,656
Thank you.

58
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,659
Ooh, Rodney, I love your blue.

59
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,660
Hey, go like this.

60
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:58,664
-You guys hungry? I did Italian tonight.

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,363
Hey, what's happenin'?

62
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,665
Hey, where'd you put the cheese?

63
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,601
- Bye!
- Don't burn your tongue!

64
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,611
- Bye, Mel.
- Oh, thanks. So long.

65
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,409
Jesus. A two-dollar tip.

66
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,417
They ate half the lasagna.

67
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,486
Mom, you're way too generous.

68
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,023
- Did Dad send you the check this month?
- Lay offhim, Tracy.

69
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,820
He just started the new job.

70
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,191
- We're fine. I worked all week.
- What?

71
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:30,696
Oh, you'd look great...

72
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:34,358
with some honey-blond
entertainment streaks...

73
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,368
right here.

74
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,166
It's not fair. I can't be mad at you
when you do that.

75
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:46,412
- Here, Mom, listen to this.
- Mmm.

76
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,880
"He was crippled,
but only his body was cracked."

77
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,882
- Yoo-hoo!
- Tracy!

78
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,418
- Hey!
- Hey, Kayla.

79
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,421
Hi. The bus never came,
and then it did.

80
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,356
I have to pee,
and she hasn't eaten anything.

81
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:03,362
Well, that's okay.
There's some stuff on the stove.

82
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:04,955
Oh, great. Okay.
Then we'll go?

83
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:07,967
Tracy, I'm sorry. I just haven't
been to a meeting all week.

84
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,968
You know I need to go.

85
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,471
- I really want to hear your poem.
- No.

86
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:15,736
- Please start over.
- It's okay, Mom.

87
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,310
No, please, I really wanna hear it.

88
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,544
He was crippled,
but only his body was cracked.

89
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,382
It's not simple, nor is it
an easy matter to explain.

90
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,617
Let's just leave it at that,
she says...

91
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,626
and closes the holy book of lies.

92
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,686
She covers her eyes, denying to herself
what she thought happened.

93
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,270
Mmm.

94
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,773
Wow.

95
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,843
That's really heavy.

96
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,945
And it scares me a little bit.

97
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,949
It's beautiful.

98
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,450
We gotta talk about it
when I get back. Okay?

99
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,657
Hey, can we
have some of this cake?

100
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,454
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Shit.

101
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,621
That's Mario's cake!
He's 1 2 years sober!

102
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,199
- Tracy, I want a piggyback ride.
- Hang on.

103
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,633
Uh, Mom.
Mom, Mom, Mom.

104
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,762
I told you I can't baby-sit.
I have an I-Search project due tomorrow.

105
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,774
Baby, cut me a break.
You know I need to go.

106
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,777
- Keep coming back.
- It works if you work it.

107
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,279
- Right, baby?

108
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:30,282
- Bye, Mommy!
- Be good!

109
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,546
- Thanks again!

110
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,490
Evie Zamora. Hey, girl!

111
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:42,027
Evie Zamora
has really pretty skin.

112
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:46,156
She's got a scar from when she tried
to save her baby brother from a fire.

113
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:48,826
You guys,
she's not Wonder Woman.

114
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,837
- Hey,you guys! I'm wearing lip gloss.

115
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,032
I'll see you guys later.

116
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,341
He's so smart.

117
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,345
He knows German.

118
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,346
Nice socks!

119
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,418
- It's that girl Tracy from chem class.

120
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,977
Who let her out
of the cabbage patch?

121
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,247
Thank God
you're cleaning up your room.

122
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,251
You hungry, baby?

123
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,752
Mom, I'm not your baby.

124
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,018
Okay.

125
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,960
- Hey, what's wrong with those socks?
- Nothing.

126
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,968
Then what are they doing
in the trash?

127
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,473
I'm not gonna wear them anymore.
I need new clothes.

128
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:04,237
- How come?
- Because I look stupid! Hello!

129
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,848
Sylvia!

130
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,349
Sylvia! Stop!

131
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,352
Please!

132
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:16,115
Emergency!

133
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,454
Mom, this one's okay.

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,460
- This is good.
- Yes. Yes.

135
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,461
Mother scores.

136
00:09:22,564 --> 00:09:24,793
Oh--

137
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,334
Now, I know I have another dollar
in quarters here somewhere.

138
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,829
Hey! Is this enough?
I could rinse these off.

139
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,239
Right on.

140
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:40,244
Okay, for the project
I'm doing J-Lo. What about you?

141
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:44,579
- I'm doing Usher.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

142
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,917
So, anyway,
I'm gonna try to, like--

143
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,757
Cute shirt.

144
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,829
Thanks. Cute belt.

145
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,343
Call me after school.
We can go shopping on Melrose.

146
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,049
Okay. Um--

147
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,119
Write your number on this.

148
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,933
Oh, my God!

149
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:49,749
- You get it?
- Oh! Yeah, wait. I have heard that one.

150
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,750
Yep, that one's good.

151
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,753
Oh, damn.
I have gymnastics today.

152
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,753
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

153
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,257
- All right. I'll see you.
- Give me a call, okay?

154
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,588
- See ya.
- Bye. Love ya.

155
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,594
I don't know.
I just wish she liked me.

156
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:05,598
- I've been there.
- Hey, Tracy!

157
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,667
- Mom wants you to clean your room.
- Okay.

158
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,243
The number you have
reached is not in service at this time.

159
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:46,493
The number you have
reached is not in service at this time.

160
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,388
What happened over here,
cockroachio?

161
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,891
Nothing, lifeguard boy.

this shit up, Trace.
