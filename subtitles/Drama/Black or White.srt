00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,804
Dr. Patterson,
line 3422, please.

2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,691
Dr. Patterson, line 3422.

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,646
<i> There's a heart</i>

4
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,929
<i> On the line</i>

5
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,323
<i> And it rests</i>

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,882
<i> With your eyes</i>

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,208
<i> Please don't fade</i>

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,806
<i> And please don't cry</i>

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,167
<i> 'Cause it's all white lies</i>

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,480
<i> Take a chance</i>

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,883
<i> Watch it fall</i>

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,725
<i> Grab too much</i>

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,690
<i> And lose it all</i>

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,770
<i> Now I've lost</i>

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,809
<i> My disguise</i>

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,684
<i> It was all white lies</i>

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,167
Elliott.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,890
Hey.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>You've reached Dave Anderson.
Leave a message.</i>

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,567
David, it's Elliott.

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,848
I'm gonna go home.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,721
They'll be taking her body
to Richter Memorial.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,602
I'll come back in the morning,
meet them, go with her,

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,286
see what's the next step.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,965
I'll talk to you in the morning.

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,850
My brother.

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,682
- She's gone?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,525
Well, what'd the doctor say?

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,644
That they, um...

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,642
That they did what they could.

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,009
Oh, my God, Elliott... I'm so sorry.

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,650
I can't believe it.

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,090
What are you gonna do now?

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,925
I don't know. Probably just go home.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,409
Well, you want some company?

36
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,244
'Cause I can come by and just hang,
you know?

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,328
You know, drink, not drink.
Talk, not talk. Listen, not listen.

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,927
Maybe tell some stories,
go for a walk, or uh...

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
You know, I'm kinda hoping
you're gonna say no here

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,480
- so I can stop doing this, all right?
- No. Thanks, though.

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,321
- I feel so shitty.
- I know, man. I know. I'm sorry.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,483
<i> Stay here</i>

43
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,166
<i> Lie with me here</i>

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,006
<i> Oh lo-fi</i>

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,891
<i> Lonely sighs</i>

46
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,647
<i> I will roam</i>

47
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,650
<i> Lost but never alone</i>

48
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,164
<i> Hide with me</i>

49
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,570
<i> Hide with me</i>

50
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,007
<i> Now you move</i>

51
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
<i> With the tide</i>

52
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,162
<i> And I've heard you've found</i>

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,688
<i> Peace of mind</i>

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,360
<i> I now know</i>

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,046
<i> That life's design</i>

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,726
<i> Moves around white lies</i>

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,806
<i> White lies</i>

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,764
<i> White lies </i>

59
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,689
Grandma? Papa?

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,965
Grandma? Papa?

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,011
Honey, hold on. Hold on, hon.

62
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,805
OK, come in.

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,801
Hey.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,490
Where's Grandma?

65
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,770
She's not here. Come give Papa a kiss.

66
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
How's my puppy?

67
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,371
Mm.

68
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,726
Is Grandma gonna take me to school?

69
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,125
I don't know. I think, um...

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,964
I think I'm gonna take you to school.

71
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,561
Can you finish getting ready?

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,290
- Yes.
- OK.

73
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,851
What's going on?

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,241
You need to comb out my hair.

75
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,050
- Really? You... You can't do that yet?
- Nope.

76
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,606
Not from the top down,
from the bottom up.

77
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,685
<i>OK.</i>

78
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,086
Wow.

79
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,166
- This is every day?
- Yup.

80
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,241
- Eloise! We can't be late, honey.
- OK.

81
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,841
Wait, wait, wait. Shut the door.

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,724
- Here. Put this in my hair, please.
- Your hair?

83
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,970
<i>OK.</i>

84
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,445
Rosita, can you help me
find my sunglasses, please?

85
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,329
- All right.
- There you go.

86
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,290
You tied it like a tennis shoe.
It needs a bow.

87
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,124
- Like Grammie does it.
- All right.

88
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,486
Come redo it.

89
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,570
Let me try again.

90
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,050
All right, there's your bow.

91
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,087
Now what?

92
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,651
You're supposed to make me
brush my teeth.

93
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,451
- I am?
- Yes. Grammie makes me every day.

94
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,530
- Forces me.
- All right, well then, you...

95
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,484
You get up there and you brush
your teeth, young lady. Right now.

96
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,244
Say it like you mean it.

97
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,887
Well, I mean it, all right?
I mean business. Right now!

98
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,769
Good job.

99
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,201
- Are you lost?
- No, I um...

100
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,727
I thought it was on this street.
I'm just...

101
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,769
I'm on the wrong street.

102
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,326
Thought it was somewhere else.

103
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,164
Isn't that called being lost?

104
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,765
Yes, normally.

105
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,642
I mean, it could be, but it isn't now,
right? I'm... not lost.

106
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,641
How come you don't know?
You come to school every day.

107
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
You don't know how to get here?

108
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,208
I'm not driving.
I'm sitting in the back.

109
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,484
If you're lost, you can tell me.
I don't care, Papa.

110
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,564
Yes, I'm lost.

111
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,322
We've gotta hurry up.
They're all inside already.

112
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,484
I know, Puppy, I know.
OK, we're right here. See?

113
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,208
I'm gonna be late!
They're all already in there.

114
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,850
It's OK.
Just tell them your grandfather got...

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,607
- Got lost?
- Yes, you can tell them I got lost.

116
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,207
- Does that make you happy?
- It does.

117
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,606
Go on.

118
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,202
<i>I didn't have
the strength to tell her.</i>

119
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,523
<i>Now I'm terrified that one of the kids
in her class will say something to her.</i>

120
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,251
I need to be there
when she gets out of school.

121
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,448
I need to tell her.

122
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,727
It's OK. You'll tell her.

123
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,929
Uh, meantime, we have some
good food here for you both to eat.

124
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,847
Yeah, I was calling about
a memorial service and a burial.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,527
Um... I had spoken to Father Mackley.

126
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,762
He suggested I give you a call.

127
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,001
I'm gonna make some dishes for you,
Elliott, some pre-cooked things

128
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,406
for you two to nibble on.

129
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,245
OK.

130
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,008
Uh, do you need to call her grandmother?
Reggie's mother?

131
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,321
What does she call her, "Wee Wee"?

132
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,970
- Grandma Wee Wee?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,690
Why would I call her, Rick?

134
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,882
I mean, really,
why would I call any of them?

135
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,202
We're not related. All right?

136
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,727
Carol wasn't related to them.

137
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,322
Guess if I was gonna... call anybody,
it'd be that piece of shit son of hers

138
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,444
that nobody's seen or heard from
in three years.

139
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,921
Believe me, the last person I need
swarming around me right now

140
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,082
is Grandma Wee Wee.

141
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,602
Bad enough I have... you two.

142
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,366
Sorry.

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,810
You didn't have to do this, you know.
I could've...

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,321
- I could've come on my own.
- Oh, come on.

145
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,006
- We want to be with you right now.
- What a pretty school.

146
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,323
I heard it's like one of the best ever.

147
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,730
- Tell me your name again?
- Fay.

148
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,450
That's right.

149
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,483
You're right, Fay.

150
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,687
Hey, there she is.

151
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,524
Hey, are you sure you're up for this?

152
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,808
Why don't I just grab her,
we'll take her back to the house,

153
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,486
- tell her later when you're...
- I'm fine. Relax, Rick.

154
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,922
Fay?

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,321
That ain't gonna help.

156
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,363
Papa, Andi Jacobson wants me to come
over and scrapbook at her house today.

157
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,885
You want to do that?

158
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,126
Go scrapbook over at
Andi Jack... ogym... Johnson's house?

159
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,329
No. But I told her I'd ask you.

160
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,766
Well, you did. You asked and I said no.

161
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,081
Thank you.

162
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,086
Let's go over here for a minute, Eloise.

163
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,649
Talk with you about something.

164
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,211
We had a bad night last night,
Eloise, you and I.

165
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,083
Grandma Carol was killed in a accident.

166
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,126
A car accident.

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,809
A man hit her and...

168
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,209
and she and he and several others,

169
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,169
they're all gone.

170
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,531
Have you been drinking?

171
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,002
I... I have, yes. That's why, um...

172
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,049
That's why Rick and his girlfriend Fudge
are out there in the car,

173
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,846
'cause I've had a few drinks.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,322
I don't like it when you drink.

175
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,766
I know.

176
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,524
Her name isn't Fudge.

177
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,729
- Rick's girlfriend, it isn't Fudge.
- Who said it was Fudge?

178
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,809
- It couldn't be. You did.
- No.

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,604
You said Rick and his girlfriend, Fudge.

180
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,041
No, I said it was, um...

181
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,761
it was...

182
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,242
- I actually don't remember her name.
- Her name, it isn't Fudge.

183
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,846
- I just know that.
- No, no. No, no, of course not.

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,002
It couldn't be Fudge.

185
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,649
I'm so sorry about your grandma, Eloise.

186
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,647
I know you loved her a lot.

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,044
And she loved you so very much.

188
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,490
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,403
- Are you OK, Pup?
- No. I'm super sad.

190
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,643
So am I, sweetheart.

191
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,845
It's the worst day of my life.

192
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,801
<i> Put a candle in the window</i>

193
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,524
<i> 'Cause I feel I've got to move</i>

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,844
<i> Though I'm gone, gone</i>

195
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,288
<i> I'll be coming home soon</i>

196
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,805
<i> Long as I can see the light</i>

197
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,725
<i> Pack my bags
and let's get moving</i>

198
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,564
<i> 'Cause I'm bound
to drift awhile</i>

199
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,365
<i> Though I'm gone</i>

200
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,127
<i> You don't have to worry</i>

201
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,487
<i> Long as I can see the light</i>

202
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,647
<i> Long as I can see the light</i>

203
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,084
<i> Guess I've got that old
traveling bone</i>

204
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,804
<i> 'Cause this feeling
won't leave me alone</i>

205
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,686
<i> But I won't</i>

206
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,970
<i> Won't be losing my way, no</i>

207
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,162
<i> Long as I can see the light </i>

208
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,449
on... Mm.

209
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,129
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Give me some love. That's right.

210
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,964
<i>Uh...</i>

211
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,601
<i>Uh...</i>

212
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,327
Elliott, Elliott, Elliott.

213
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,327
<i>Uh.</i>

214
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,486
Every time I come out here,

215
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,008
I tell myself, "One day, Rowena,

216
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,926
you're gonna get Elliott
to invite us all out for a swim."

217
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,641
You got a plan for Eloise
in light of all this?

218
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,406
Not sure, not yet.

219
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,767
Probably just love her.
That's the plan for now.

220
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,524
Mm.

221
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,645
She's got a whole lot of family
down with me. Mm-hm.

222
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,850
I got my Kristen, and her cute little
gay family across the street.

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,810
And her darlin'
little music teacher wife.

224
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,203
Got two of my brother's girls
and my sister's boy.

225
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,530
- All on my dime.
- Go figure.

226
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,690
Well, you can always come visit,
come for a swim. How's that?

227
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,611
I know you don't like my boy.

228
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,081
I know you're still angry,
but this isn't about Reggie.

229
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,041
He's not in the picture.
This is about Eloise.

230
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,844
OK, got it.

231
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,765
Got it. Jeez...

232
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,367
Have a sandwich, Rowena.
Maybe a drink. All right?

233
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,646
Enjoy yourself.

234
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,043
I'd go somewhere and play some poker
if I was looking to enjoy myself.

235
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,725
Maybe a Lakers game.

236
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,723
Not here for a good time.

237
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,566
- It's a wake, remember?
- Fine.

238
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,971
Point taken.

239
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,046
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
in your mouth, now.

240
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,724
- What?
- Madder.

241
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,321
You gotta be madder at me
like you mean it.

242
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,604
Let me, uh...

243
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,564
Want me to just go out and start again?

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,966
Yeah.

245
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,082
Eloise, you brush those teeth!
I mean it.

246
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,686
Don't make me come in there
and have to say it twice.

247
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,330
Nice.

248
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,326
Aren't you going
to drive me to school?

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,321
Yes.

250
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,050
<i>OK.</i>

251
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,925
Morning.

252
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,810
You're in the third grade
and you're dealing...

253
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,442
You're in the third grade and you're
dealing with this level math?

254
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,571
I didn't deal with
this stuff until... ever.

255
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,161
Does that mean
you're not going to help me?

256
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,006
Of course not.

257
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,525
Not at all. Let's take a...

258
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,329
Let's take a shot at this.

259
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,364
I'm not very good at math, though,
all right? I'm a lawyer.

260
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,006
- You know what we're good at, right?
- What?

261
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,361
Nothing.

262
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,125
That was...

263
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,611
That was a joke.

264
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,044
Hi. I'm Duvan. Are you Elliott?

265
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,521
Yes, yes. Uh...

266
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,210
- Nice to meet you. Come on in.
- Thank you.

267
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,486
Come on in.

268
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,808
My resume.

269
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,209
A list of my study courses.

270
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,281
A paper that I wrote
for the National Math Board

271
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,410
on systemic dysfunction
in proper Algebraic education.

272
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,281
That's good. This is good.

273
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,845
- You want a drink?
- I would... like a drink, yes.

274
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,368
OK, good.
What do you like? I got the works.

275
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,524
Oh, no, just a water, please.

276
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,730
And... another paper that I wrote.

277
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,644
In the flyer, my piano lessons.

278
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,521
I have a fall special that I'm currently
running that offers the piano lessons

279
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,206
half off when purchased with tutoring
in either math, science

280
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,966
or any of the 8 languages
that I have listed there.

281
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,527
You sure you don't want a cocktail?

282
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,842
You're very, very qualified, Duvan.
That's good.

283
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,611
Because Eloise, she's special.

284
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,800
She lost her grandmother... my wife,
about 3 weeks ago in a car crash.

285
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,201
I don't want her to fall behind
in her studies.

286
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,362
- What about her mother?
- My daughter?

287
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,969
She died during childbirth.
She had congenital heart problems.

288
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,600
My wife and I weren't with her
at the hospital when she was born.

289
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,450
Weren't invited. Or included.

290
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,331
We, uh... We weren't called,
let's just put it that way.

291
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,768
The doctors weren't aware
of her medical history.

292
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,326
I lost my father, my grandfather
and two of my brothers.

293
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,963
Killed by murderers,
along with 300 others from my village.

294
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,641
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,844
A paper I wrote on literature's
effect on grief

296
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,130
for the library of the National
Endowment for Children's Literature.

297
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,683
I have also written a paper
on channeling our emotions

298
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,448
in a positive direction using meditation
and alternative grief counseling.

299
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,807
That's good, but there's gonna
be something else, all right?

300
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,167
It's not gonna be just Eloise.

301
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,771
It's gonna be me as well.

302
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,403
I'm gonna need a little tutoring
in math myself.

303
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,562
Is that gonna be a problem?

304
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,610
No, that will not be a problem at all.

305
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,207
I do, however, charge by the student.

306
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,045
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

307
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
<i>Elliott, it's Rowena.</i>

308
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,568
Now I need you to pick up that phone
and call me, baby.

309
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,240
I know you're in pain.
Your pain is my pain.

310
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,209
That little girl is my little girl. OK?

311
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,410
<i>Pick up the phone. Call Wee Wee.
Call Wee Wee.</i>

312
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,046
Kyle had 32 shells.

313
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,601
He gave 8 to his friend.

314
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,526
- How many shells does Kyle have now?
- 8 to his friend?

315
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,728
8 to his friend.
This might be a bit easier for you.

316
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,247
But write it down, please, both of you.

317
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,883
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

318
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,451
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

319
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,922
So what's the deal with, uh,
Jonny Quest's sidekick?

320
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,570
- Where'd you find him?
- Craigslist.

321
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,331
- Oh, yeah?
- He's very good.

322
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,165
So what's going on?
What's so important you had to see me?

323
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,847
It's Reggie's mother.

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,684
You know who her baby brother is, right?

325
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,207
He's a senior partner
at that new firm over there on Flower.

326
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,601
She's got him threatening
to file a family court hearing

327
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,087
on custody of Eloise
unless you deal with her.

328
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,045
- Threatening or filing?
- Threatening, at this point.

329
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,765
Well, that's hilarious.

330
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,890
They don't know jack about family law.
They sue corporations, Rick.

331
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,924
They make billionaires beg.
They don't...

332
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,690
They don't do custody hearings.

333
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,605
Well, guess what, Elliott,
neither do we.

334
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,410
Have you thought about that?

335
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,571
Listen...

336
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,687
Do you really plan on raising this girl?
Full time?

337
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,764
I'm not being a dick. I'm just asking.
Are you sure you're up for this?

338
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,651
You know... raising a little
black girl all by yourself?

339
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,804
Little black... What the hell
does that mean? She's not black!

340
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,883
- All right? She's half black.
- All right.

341
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,690
She's also half white.

342
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,842
Which, by the way, what does that
have to do with anything?

343
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,651
That's the stupidest thing
you ever said to me. I expect that...

344
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,529
I expect that from Wee Wee, not you.

345
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,923
OK, well, technically,
she has just as many rights as you do.

346
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,282
Just enough to have it
brought up in a hearing.

347
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,683
So I suggest you go and talk it out with
her before she gets the state involved.

348
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,446
I'm telling you, Rowena's brother is
not somebody you wanna mess around with.

349
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,887
The guy has like 6 different degrees.

350
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,090
Well, you know how many degrees your
rectal thermometer has at home, Rick?

351
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,847
You know where
you put that thing? Shit.

352
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,371
These are the study papers
for the next time that we meet.

353
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,689
Can I go watch TV now,
since I worked on my homework?

354
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,128
Of course you can, but first,
say good-bye to Duvan.

355
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,443
- Bye, Duvan.
- Bye.

356
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,050
- Thank you, Elliott.
- Hey, Duvie, can I ask you something?

357
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,847
I know you offer a lot of services,
teach a lot of languages.

358
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,049
- Different skills, you know, shit.
- Yeah, I do.

359
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,440
Can you drive?

360
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,641
I mean, for some good money.
I'm not, um...

361
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
capable of driving... right now.

362
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,730
Could you drive me around town
a little today?

363
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,285
Of course, I can do that.

364
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,211
Good. Good. Uh...

365
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,365
Don't tell me you've written a paper
on driving, though. Don't tell me that.

366
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,445
<i> All the waiters
in your grand cafe</i>

367
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,606
You do drive well, Duvan.

368
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,240
- Thank you.
- <i>Um...</i>

369
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,209
Where are we going?

370
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,204
South of downtown. South Central.

371
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,725
Have you been there?

372
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,202
No. No, I have not.

373
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,089
Probably seen it on television, though.

374
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,210
- CSI or something?
- I don't watch much television.

375
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,361
No, of course not.

376
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,081
I'm afraid, for me, it is not
a nourishing form of entertainment.

377
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,287
Maybe you should consider

378
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,321
curtailing the amount of hours
Eloise watches television.

379
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,924
OK. Got it. Good tip.

380
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,845
Let's get off at this exit here.
Right here.

381
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,766
<i> Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances</i>

382
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,288
<i> Don't ask me why</i>

383
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:11,290
<i> Mm, you can say the human heart
is only make-believe</i>

384
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,284
<i> I am only fighting fire with fire</i>

385
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,286
<i> But you are still a victim
of the accidents you leave</i>

386
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,966
<i> As sure as
I'm a victim of desire </i>

387
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,043
Right up here by this tree.

388
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,805
- Margaret.
- Elliott.

389
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,406
What's up, Elliott, man?

390
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,961
Give me some love, man.

391
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,969
I'm sorry again about Carol.

392
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,771
Thanks, thanks. Where's your aunt?

393
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,803
She in the garage.

394
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,445
Who's this?

395
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,161
<i>Uh... This is Duvan. He's, uh...</i>

396
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,244
- He's my bodyguard.
- No shit.

397
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,882
- You got you a bodyguard?
- Wow.

398
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,647
Is it just me or has the whole world
gotten real gullible?

399
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,440
Hey, Uncle Victor.

400
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,449
- Hey there, Elliott. How's it going?
- Good.

401
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,046
I would get up,
but this back's been killing me.

402
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,362
No worries. I know the feeling.

403
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,561
- Look who's here.
- Hey, Elliott.

404
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,451
- Hey, Elliott.
- Hey, come here. Give me some love.

405
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,001
- Come here. How are you?
- I'm real good, thanks.

406
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,484
- All right.
- This is, uh... Duv... Duv-something.

407
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,928
Um... Elliott got him a bodyguard.

408
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,846
Ooh! Really? You're a bodyguard?

409
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,527
No, that is just some humor
that Elliott had implied earlier.

410
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,167
Come here. Give me some love anyway,
Mr. Bodyguard. Come here.

411
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,164
Oh, wow, I feel safer already.

412
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,962
You OK, Mr. Bodyguard?

413
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,841
Oh, hey, uh... when we come back in,
maybe you can speak to them as a group

414
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,042
about watching too much television.

415
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,729
Well, well, look who came to visit.

416
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,285
This is quite a setup, Rowena.

417
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,001
Quite a setup.

418
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,445
Always impressive.

419
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,762
We aim to impress.

420
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,490
Do our best.

421
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,929
You're welcome to have one.

422
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,521
I just bought out the men's department
of a Sears going down.

423
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,206
Got some beautiful suits
for some lucky men in the neighborhood.

424
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,681
Can only help, right?

425
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,444
- Who do we have here?
- Oh, this is Duvan, our math tutor.

426
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,887
That's good. Math is good.

427
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,442
Math is my middle name, babe.

428
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,565
Rowena, you're not gonna really
take me to court, are you?

429
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,404
Eloise is happy where she is.

430
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,605
Eloise needs more love than just
what her grandfather can give her.

431
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,724
Now Carol... God rest her soul...

432
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,609
Carol was a mom.

433
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,762
She and I, we had us a bond.

434
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,651
Therefore, I had no reason
to worry about my grandbaby.

435
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,801
And now you do?

436
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,089
Well, there are certain things a man
can do, certain things a woman can do.

437
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,447
I don't wanna have to be the one
to spell that out to you, Elliott.

438
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,329
Especially a man your age.

439
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,323
I already told her that
you're all welcome to come visit.

440
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,643
I'm thinking with things
the way they are,

441
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,845
life dealing us all the hands
we've been dealt, she's been dealt,

442
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,321
we need to start talking
about a shared custody.

443
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,720
Not gonna happen.

444
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,291
- No?
- No.

445
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,200
Like I say, you're all welcome
to come visit.

446
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,004
But you don't want her down here,
do you, Elliott?

447
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,004
- Down here with the black folks.
- Don't... Don't start with that.

448
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,842
Got her a little black math tutor.
Is that gonna do it? Hm?

449
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,365
Take care of that whole half
of her soul?

450
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,443
What is it with you?
Why do you always have to go there?

451
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,600
What is it with you that you don't wanna
admit that there's a "there" there?

452
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,571
And you. You're a math tutor.
Is that it?

453
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,525
He gets $25 an hour?

454
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,209
Damn, that's a good business.

455
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,362
- Is this Elliott's ride here?
- Yup.

456
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,648
He's in the garage with your mom
and his bodyguard.

457
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,450
Elliott has a bodyguard?

458
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,847
He got himself some
fancy foreign bodyguard.

459
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,650
The goofiest thing you've ever seen.

460
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,609
Come on, Rowena, don't be stubborn.

461
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,967
She's in one of the best schools
in the entire country.

462
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,407
One of the safest neighborhoods
in Los Angeles.

463
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,131
You and I know a different version
of the word "safe."

464
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,971
That girl belongs down here
with her family, Elliott.

465
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,400
You just want her away from me.

466
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,210
You just want her...
That's all you want.

467
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,125
You just want her away from us.
The black people.

468
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,801
Now why... Why do you always
have to checkmate me with that shit?

469
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,447
You always do this.
You always say something like that.

470
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,604
How am I supposed to respond?

471
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,768
After all your son put us through?

472
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,811
The hell he unleashed on Carol
and my daughter, I think you'd...

473
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,724
l think you'd have
the common sense to understand

474
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,201
he can never be anywhere near her.

475
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,044
Don't be coming down here lecturing me,

476
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,601
all liquored up,
about common sense, Elliott.

477
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,401
I'm this girl's grandmother
whether you like it or not, OK?

478
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,449
- I'm just looking out for my babies.
- Yeah.

479
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,683
My baby boy and my baby granddaughter.

480
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,644
Ahh...

481
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,247
- Bye, Elliott.
- See ya, Elliott.

482
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,324
- Send Eloise our love, hear?
- Oh, no.

483
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,562
No!

484
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,761
Elliott, no.

485
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,366
Elliott, that's not your car!

486
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,961
- That's not your hooptie!
- Elliott.

487
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,805
That way!

488
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,961
Look at that.

489
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,641
Yay! Bravo! Bravo!

490
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,608
Make it home safe!

491
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,641
I'd like to introduce you all
to my sister, Rowena.

492
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,009
As you've all been briefed,
my sister has retained us...

493
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,607
for a family custody matter.

494
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,242
In front of you, you all have iPads
full of all the filing information

495
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,926
we will have access to
in processing this case.

496
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,962
Now this is, to us, obviously much more
than just a child custody hearing.

497
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,122
It's much bigger than that.

498
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,889
This will be argued as a breach
of a minor's rights to her family.

499
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,485
To her people.

500
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,166
Taken away by a man who,
for some reason,

501
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,364
don't too much care for black folks.

502
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,124
Wait a minute, Jeremiah.

503
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,647
I didn't exactly say that.
I'm sorry.

504
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,043
I mean, he lost his wife,
he lost his daughter,

505
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,362
and he isn't sure he feels safe
with her down with us.

506
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,524
Oh, he's got a problem
with black people.

507
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,444
If he didn't,
we wouldn't be here, right?

508
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,888
You'd be at home making
some kind of dinner for the child,

509
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,610
helping her with her homework.

510
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,123
Let's just say there was a nice
little white family, just like yours,

511
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,569
but white, living in
a nice little white neighborhood,

512
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,009
willing to pick up the responsibilities,
take care of the child.

513
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,447
You mean to tell me that little girl
wouldn't have come to that funeral

514
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,001
with her suitcases packed,
ready to go home with them?

515
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,370
Now I give him credit for what he's
doing, taking care of the child and all,

516
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,569
but he's only doing it because
he feels like he has no other option.

517
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,450
- Do you want what's best for the child?
- Yes.

518
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,922
Then he has a problem with black people.

519
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,769
Now it's our job to make sure

520
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,562
that he and the court
understand that very clearly.

521
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,089
Elliott. So good to see you.

522
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,890
It's good to see you too, Rita.

523
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,491
I hope this means you'll be back.

524
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,122
I'll be back. Not...
Not sure when just yet.

525
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,567
The intel we have says
they're gonna come guns blazing.

526
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,808
We think they even had something to do
with the seating of the judge,

527
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,086
but that's just speculation.

528
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,811
Either way, it's Cummins.
Judge Cummins.

529
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,804
They got themselves a black lady judge.

530
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,850
In family court,
you might as well close up shop now.

531
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,162
A lady judge is always
gonna go with the mother.

532
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,971
If there's no mother,
the state or the grandmother.

533
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,964
And a black lady judge
is never gonna give a little black girl

534
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,485
to a white grandfather.

535
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,804
All right, let's talk about Rowena.

536
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,531
She was born and raised in LA.
One of 6.

537
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,729
Never went to college.
She's a self-made woman.

538
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,530
She has a real estate license.

539
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,401
Owns about 6 businesses, 3 homes.

540
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,530
She's raising 3 nephews, a niece.

541
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,241
She has a daughter who lives across
the street, a gay woman and her wife.

542
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,289
And then she's got the son,
Reggie Jr.

543
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,284
He's been convicted three times
on felony drug charges.

544
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,249
Pretty much is the bad apple
of the family.

545
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,970
Oh, we'll find her weak spots.

546
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,488
Get a couple of private investigators
shaking her tree for a week and a half

547
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,167
and believe me, a lot more bad apples
are gonna fall out, no doubt about it.

548
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,524
The point is,
are you OK getting ugly, Elliott?

549
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,241
We can get a lot uglier than they can.

550
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,562
Remember that, Elliott.

551
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,722
You wanna keep your
little granddaughter,

552
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,089
damn well bet
you're gonna do just that.

553
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,969
Just give us the go-ahead.

554
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,882
Something else I wanted
to talk to you about before you go.

555
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,368
It's your drinking.

556
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,166
This is my brother-in-law,
my sister's husband.

557
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,209
He's in Alcoholics Anonymous.

558
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,684
I don't have a drinking problem, Rick,
all right?

559
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,365
I enjoy drinking.

560
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,602
If it were a problem, I'd stop.

561
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,444
Yeah, what do I know, right?

562
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,682
I'm just the guy you brought along,
dragged up through the ranks,

563
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,241
- I couldn't possibly know anything.
- I hope that's not the case.

564
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,890
I picked you to represent me, right?

565
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,889
You're about ready to get
dragged into a street fight here,

566
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,600
with both hands tied behind your back,

567
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,883
and the booze is gonna do its best
to make sure you lose Eloise.

568
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,405
All right?

569
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,930
Just call my brother-in-law.

570
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,287
All right.

571
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,611
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna make you pancakes.

572
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,206
You're not the only one
who can make pancakes.

573
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,600
Set the table, please.

574
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,885
Puppy, do you ever...

575
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,883
you ever think about
living somewhere else?

576
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,041
Where?

577
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,965
I don't know, maybe...
over there with Grandma Wee Wee?

578
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,446
- With your cousins?
- Would you want that?

579
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,971
For us to go live there?

580
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,724
No, it wouldn't be me,
it'd just be you.

581
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,644
I'd visit, you'd come back here, visit.

582
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,201
But... you'd live with them.

583
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,246
- Would that maybe be better?
- No.

584
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,329
I don't like that.

585
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,881
I like it here.

586
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,530
With you.

587
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,843
- With Rosita and my friends.
- I know, but maybe I'm like a...

588
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,126
you know, I'm...

589
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,681
You know, I'm just like an old guy, El.

590
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,811
Don't you think a seven-year-old
should be hanging out with other kids?

591
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,971
I'm with other kids all day long.
You're talking silly, Papa.

592
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,962
Set the table, please.

593
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,209
"'Who are you?' I ask,
and aim my watch light at the voices.

594
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,840
The light reveals a mermaid.

595
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,370
No, 5 mermaids, all with green
and orange swishing tails.

596
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,411
The tops they're wearing look familiar,
but I can't figure out from where."

597
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,810
- What?
- I love you, Papa.

598
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,841
"'We're Lana's sisters, '
the one in the middle says.

599
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,011
'She has short, butter-colored hair
and she's wearing a white..."

600
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,767
Are you OK, Papa?

601
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,203
I'm good.

602
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,964
It's just a really sad story.

603
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,921
It's not sad. It's about a mermaid
that takes her family on a vacation.

604
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,165
No, I... I know.

605
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,048
It just reminds me of another story.
A sad one.

606
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,929
I just got sad.

607
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,842
It's fine.

608
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,409
"'We've been spying on her but we can't
get too close to the shore. ls..."'

609
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,650
"'ls Lana OK?'

610
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,721
'Not exactly, ' I say,
before explaining the whole story."

611
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,131
<i> Oh</i>

612
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,285
<i> It's been such a long</i>

613
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,485
<i> Long time</i>

614
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,244
<i> Look like I'd get you
off of my mind</i>

615
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,488
<i> But I can't</i>

616
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,164
<i> Just the thought of you</i>

617
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,802
<i> Turns my whole world misty blue </i>

618
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,770
Papa! Come brush my hair!

619
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,923
Papa, are you sure you're OK?

620
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,809
You seem like something's
wrong with you.

621
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,249
No, baby, I'm fine.
Papa... Papa just had a rough night.

622
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,966
<i>OK.</i>

623
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,880
<i>OK.</i>

624
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,691
<i>OK.</i>

625
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,329
<i>OK.</i>

626
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,766
Let's go.

627
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,083
Where are you going?
You seem like something's wrong.

628
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,561
Where are you going?
Why is Duvie all dressed up like that?

629
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,929
I have a business thing this morning.
He's coming with me, OK?

630
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,287
It's fine, honey, all right? It's fine.

631
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,364
You've been drinking.
That's why Duvie has to drive.

632
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,127
I told you.
I told you that I had a hard night.

633
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,802
- What?
- Where are you going today?

634
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,611
Just a business meeting, Puppy,
now get inside. Go on.

635
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,603
Go on in the school.

636
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,563
- What's she doing here?
- Who, Fay?

637
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,160
Oh, she's never been in a courtroom.

638
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,521
You really are a piece of work.

639
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,489
This is their brief.

640
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,890
You need to derail all this for me,
Rick.

641
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,371
I don't know where Reggie is, OK?

642
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,010
But when he comes back,
he's gonna want to take her.

643
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,447
And I can't let that happen.

644
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,526
- You've been drinking again?
- What makes you say that?

645
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,445
Well, Hadji drove here,
your breath smells like Binaca,

646
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,761
and you look like you spent the night

647
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,964
getting dragged through
cobblestone streets by angry villagers.

648
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,520
Other than that, I'm just guessing.

649
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,565
- Hey.
- Fay, my name is Fay.

650
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,204
I said, "Hey." As in hello.

651
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,691
Hey.

652
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,605
You gonna be all right in there?

653
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,965
You go in there, all right?
And you get this done.

654
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,485
You understand?

655
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,968
- What's his problem?
- Ah, he's under a cloud of crap.

656
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,009
- Hey, you excited?
- Yeah.

657
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,771
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

658
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,922
Who is the lead counsel
for the Jeffers family?

659
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,250
- I am, Your Honor.
- And who is the lead for Mr. Anderson?

660
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,401
I am, Your Honor.

661
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,404
Rick... Rick Reynolds with Stacy,
Vertell, Anderson and Beighan,

662
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,403
- on behalf of Elliott Anderson.
- OK.

663
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,404
And I assume this is
Ms. Jeffers, your sister?

664
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,847
Yes, Your Honor.
Pleased to meet you.

665
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,963
OK. Um, I have your brief for parental
custody on behalf of Ms. Jeffers

666
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,647
and I want you to know up front,
I think it's a bit of an overreach.

667
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,131
Why aren't you asking
for shared custody?

668
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,965
Well, Your Honor,
we feel that the child's environment

669
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,329
is not conducive to her growing up
with a strong sense of self-esteem.

670
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,644
We feel that she is in need of much more
support, community and history

671
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,121
than she's currently getting
living with her grandfather.

672
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,489
Well, unless you're gonna be making
some pretty serious claims

673
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,007
about her grandfather,
who she's lived with her whole life,

674
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,680
that you don't seem to be making here,

675
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,127
I don't think we have enough
to warrant a hearing on full custody.

676
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,931
I mean, not when we're talking
one grandparent to another, right?

677
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,000
Uh... OK, anything else, Mr. Reynolds?

678
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,003
Anything other than your briefs?

679
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,240
Yes, only Your Honor, if I can quickly
tell you that Mr. Anderson and his wife

680
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,006
went through a life-altering tragedy
when their 17-year-old daughter,

681
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,605
completely unbeknownst to them,

682
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,161
became pregnant
by Mr. Reginald Davis, Jr.,

683
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,169
who at the time was 23 years old.

684
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,044
The pregnancy was hidden
from them by their daughter

685
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,242
for the first several months,
and then she was gone from them

686
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,721
for the last several weeks,
hiding away at a friend's in shame.

687
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,724
When she had the child,
the Andersons were not informed,

688
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,680
and as such, were not at the hospital
when their daughter died,

689
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,450
in a case of indirect maternal death

690
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,286
that they felt would've been preventable
had they been present during the labor.

691
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,044
Your Honor,
as horrible as this may be,

692
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,520
it has no bearing on the custody
of the child at this time.

693
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,880
Actually, it does, Your Honor,

694
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,402
because it speaks loudly to the roots
of Mr. Davis' track record as a father,

695
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,840
starting from the night she was born.

696
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,163
Your Honor, our petition
has nothing to do with Reggie Davis.

697
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,891
It's on behalf of his family.
His mother.

698
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,769
His mother has nothing to do with him?

699
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,321
Not at this time, Your Honor, no.

700
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,280
My boy is in pain, Your Honor.
He's a good boy.

701
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,727
He's lost. He's trying.
But he isn't the issue.

702
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,885
The issue is this man doesn't want
our family in our baby girl's life,

703
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,730
and we just need to be.

704
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,043
Now she has to be living with us.
That's all there is to it.

705
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,931
Also, Your Honor, sad to have to say,

706
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,651
he's got himself a drinking problem
that needs to be looked into.

707
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,241
Just as a side note, your people
got some work on their hands

708
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,482
looking into that, if you ask me.

709
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,886
The man can drink.

710
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,125
Mr. Jeffers,
if we do go ahead and move to hearing,

711
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,330
that... that's not gonna happen again,
am I right?

712
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,921
- 'Cause I won't put up with that.
- You are correct, Your Honor.

713
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,809
It... It won't happen again.

714
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,601
OK, the clerk will schedule
a family custody hearing

715
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,644
and I'm gonna order psychiatric
evaluations of young Miss Anderson.

716
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,845
And please beware, all of you,
that when we go down this road,

717
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,324
the state has custody options
other than the Jeffers and Mr. Anderson,

718
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,888
so we will all be very courteous
and respectful.

719
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,565
All right?

720
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,404
All rise.

721
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,327
Seemed like that did not go so well.

722
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,481
Yeah.

723
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,166
Have you thought about
learning a new language?

724
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,006
When I am low, or in a place in my life
where I cannot make things happen

725
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,003
the way I want them to happen,

726
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,846
sometimes to busy myself,
I teach myself a new language.

727
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,844
It really seems to help me
feel more at ease.

728
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,765
Even if truly I am just distracted.

729
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,526
Duvan, tell me the truth.

730
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,688
What planet are you really from?

731
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,526
OK? I'm not gonna report you,
I just would like to know.

732
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,882
Eloise, are you sure you're OK?

733
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,044
You want to talk at all about
what you talk with the lady about?

734
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,244
No. I'm OK.

735
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,642
What do you talk about, honey?

736
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,762
Uh, I don't know.
We talk about my daddy, I guess.

737
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,360
If I have dreams of him.

738
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,844
- Do you?
- Yes. Sometimes. Are you mad?

739
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,964
No. Not at all.

740
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,169
The lady said me wanting
to see my daddy would make you angry.

741
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,084
The therapist said that to you?

742
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,368
Actually, she asked me
if it would make you angry

743
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,249
if I dreamed of seeing my daddy.

744
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,324
- What did you say?
- I said I didn't know.

745
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,282
I just dropped Eloise back at school.

746
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,286
She had another one of those...
therapy sessions that the judge ordered.

747
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,920
They're starting to get to her.

748
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,282
She's changing, Rick.

749
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,727
These people are getting in her head
and I don't like it.

750
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,690
<i>OK, I'll get into it. Why don't
I swing by the house in like an hour?</i>

751
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,286
We need to petition a judge on this,
all right?

752
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,602
And I don't want these damn therapists
messing with her head.

753
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,246
- We need to limit this.
- <i>All right. I'm on it, I'm on it.</i>

754
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,370
Eloise.

755
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,127
Eloise, this is the paper
you were supposed to turn in, right?

756
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,523
- Didn't we work on this with Duvan?
- I don't remember.

757
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,803
You have to finish this homework, honey,
all right? Isn't it due tomorrow?

758
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,407
- I think it is.
- Well then, turn that thing off there.

759
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,846
Turn it off,
and get to work on this now.

760
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,285
Papa, you need to stop being so mad
all the time. It's not healthy.

761
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,923
Very good, very good.

762
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,682
You're back.

763
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,411
You're back. I'm so glad.

764
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,206
I have so much
I need to talk to you about.

765
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,521
Rowena wants to take Eloise.

766
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,686
Of course I... said no.

767
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,202
That's what you'd do, right?

768
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,362
I miss you so much.

769
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,447
Don't go away again.

770
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,965
<i>Please...</i>

771
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,922
What did we say, hm?

772
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,925
What did we say about watching cartoons?

773
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,730
- I forget.
- No, you don't.

774
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,804
We said no cartoons until
the homework's done. It's not done.

775
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,088
Now, turn it off.

776
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,767
Eloise, turn that thing off. All right?

777
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,446
I'm being serious here, honey.
This is my serious voice.

778
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,126
You're about to make Papa very angry.
Now turn it off!

779
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,610
I'm gonna count to three.
I'm being serious. One... two...

780
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,606
You listen to me when I'm speaking
to you, young lady, do you hear me, huh?

781
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,285
Do you hear me?

782
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,249
I don't know who you think
you're dealing with here,

783
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,607
but I'm not gonna put up with it!

784
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,566
- Eloise, come here.
- I don't want to live with you.

785
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,161
I want my daddy.

786
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,120
<i>Elliott, you gotta get down here</i>

787
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,525
- <i>as fast as possible.</i>
<i>- What's up?</i>

788
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,364
- <i>It's Reggie.</i>
- <i>What about him?</i>

789
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,090
- He's here.
- Where?

790
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,571
Here, in our office.

791
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,563
He just showed up,
said it was important,

792
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,371
<i>said he needs to see you.
You need to get down here.</i>

793
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,167
Hey, Elliott.

794
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,691
What's up?

795
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,723
Follow me.

796
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,685
Rita, I think this one's
gonna need some strong coffee.

797
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,686
What do you want?

798
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,640
Just, uh... wanted to say hey.

799
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,531
Hey? Good.

800
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,011
Now what do you want?

801
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,811
Elliott, don't be all that way, man.

802
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,042
I need you not to be
all harsh and shit, please.

803
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,965
You came here, Reggie.
Now what is it that you want?

804
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,926
I wanted to talk to you about the girl.

805
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,963
- My daughter.
- Eloise.

806
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,162
- Mm-hm.
- What about her?

807
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,244
Well, I know from Rex and them
that my moms and Jeremiah and them,

808
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,801
they wanna...
they wanna take her from you.

809
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,969
There's gonna be a hearing and, um...

810
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,369
I could just go ahead and say that
you should have custody of her, but...

811
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,608
l just, I need some help now,
Elliott.

812
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,647
I meant me.

813
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,525
The coffee's for me.

814
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,931
- I need some money, Elliott.
- Why am I not shocked?

815
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,203
Why don't you get it from
your Uncle Jeremiah. He's a big shot.

816
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,804
He don't think a whole lot of me.

817
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,207
Mm-hm. What makes you think I do?

818
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,843
What about your mother? I know you don't
have a problem taking money from her.

819
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,520
Well, she's not gonna give me anything

820
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,285
unless I come home
and do things her way.

821
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,602
Why would I give you anything?

822
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,966
Well, I thought...

823
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,367
l thought that I could
make things easy on you.

824
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,324
You know, just not
be around during all this.

825
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,125
So you, um...

826
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,485
you think by your staying here,

827
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,642
it makes it easier for them
to take Eloise from me.

828
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,928
Let me tell you something.
The girl, your daughter, Eloise,

829
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,884
she's the only decent thing
you have going.

830
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,730
- Yeah, I know, Elliott. I know that.
- No, you don't.

831
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,160
You don't know shit, all right?

832
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,730
You don't know your head
from your ballsack.

833
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,320
I've half a mind to snap your neck
right now, you understand?

834
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,447
I am clean, Elliott.

835
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,648
I've been up in Seattle,
trying to get it together,

836
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,887
- trying to stay clean.
- Bullshit.

837
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,762
No, it's not bullshit.
I'm on a new path. And you got me wrong.

838
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,845
I just...

839
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,846
I'm just hurting with some debts, man,
and I could use a little help.

840
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,923
And I'll go away, man,
for good this time.

841
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,527
You aren't going anywhere.

842
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,251
You be out at my house tonight
at 7:00 for dinner,

843
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,689
with flowers, a gift,
and a strong line of bullshit.

844
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,444
You come say hello to Eloise, OK?
Eloise. That's her name.

845
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,568
She needs to see you.

846
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,491
She wants to see me? Really?

847
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,769
She's in a lot of pain.

848
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,886
<i>OK.</i>

849
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,889
OK, 7:00. I'll be there.

850
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,207
Then we can talk some more, you and me?
About that... about the money?

851
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,930
Get out.

852
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,969
Now. Just get out!

853
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,168
- Think I got everything.
- Yes.

854
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,451
- I'm gonna shower.
- No rush.

855
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,163
Wow. You look very, very pretty, Puppy.

856
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,607
Did he say where he's been?

857
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,569
Yes, he's been away on business.

858
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,281
Did he say why he hasn't called?
All this time?

859
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,444
There was a problem, um...
with the phones where he's been.

860
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,681
He feels badly.

861
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,804
But he's coming right now.
That's all that matters.

862
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,969
- Right?
- Yes. That's all that matters.

863
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,923
Why don't you go help Rosita
in the kitchen.

864
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,368
What you making for me,
my daddy and Papa?

865
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,887
Potatoes and chicken.

866
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,970
Rosita?

867
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,771
Fix yourself a plate to eat,
bring it in here, sweetheart.

868
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,402
I'm sorry, Puppy. He, uh...
He must've gotten held up or something.

869
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,921
Can I be excused, please?

870
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,287
Of course you can.

871
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,244
You don't have to hide this, OK?

872
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,246
This is all I drink, you know that.
This is all I drink.

873
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,882
OK? You don't have to hide it.
It doesn't do me any good.

874
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:54,802
I know you think it helps...
but it doesn't.

875
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,406
You understand?

876
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,531
<i>Oh...</i>

877
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,210
Jesus.

878
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,648
- Who is it?
- It's Wee Wee, Elliott. Open up.

879
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,885
Oh, Lord.

880
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,368
Please, God, give me a break.

881
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,249
You said we were welcome any time
to come swimming, right?

882
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,885
Rowena, are you kidding me?

883
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,805
We came over to have a good time today,
Elliott. What do you say?

884
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,450
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

885
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,449
Hey, baby.

886
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,243
Eloise, your grandmother's
brought over a pool party.

887
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,365
Are you in the...
Are you in the mood to go swimming?

888
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,409
Yes! Can we? Please, Papa!
Please, Papa!

889
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,404
- Please, Papa?
- Please?

890
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,564
Of course.

891
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,166
- Come on in, everyone.
- Yay!

892
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,765
- Hey, good morning.
- Thank you.

893
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,164
Welcome. Welcome.

894
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,288
Yeah!

895
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,004
Hey, Dondi, y'all get that table set up.
I'll be right back.

896
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,770
Whoo!

897
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,846
<i>Uh...</i>

898
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,846
Elliott, I need to tell you something.

899
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,088
Reggie's outside in the car.

900
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,687
Reggie's here now?

901
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,080
- Don't get upset.
- He's out...

902
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,326
- Don't get upset.
- He's out front?

903
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,289
He told me about last night.

904
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,125
Now, Elliott, you need
to let the past be the past.

905
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,523
He's off all the drugs. He's cleaned up,
he's changing his whole life.

906
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,051
- Oh, please.
- It's true.

907
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,727
Look past that sour hangover attitude
you got wrapped around your face

908
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,882
and listen up for once.

909
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,362
Elliott, he's afraid
you're gonna get all up in his face

910
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,846
and embarrass him in front of Eloise.

911
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,571
You know, you wouldn't know the truth
when it comes to this guy

912
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,167
if it came up behind you,
slapped you on your fanny.

913
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,528
Hey! What happened to you last night?

914
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,480
- Huh? Where were you?
- Man, I wanted to come.

915
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,766
- I just couldn't...
- You know what?

916
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,167
Actually, I don't give a shit.
Just get your ass in the house, Reggie.

917
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,084
Go on, Reggie.
You don't have to be afraid of me.

918
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,924
I wouldn't dream of embarrassing you

919
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,320
to make you look bad
in front of your daughter.

920
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,211
Listen, Elliott.
I wanted to be here last night.

921
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,045
I did. You need to know that.

922
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,601
All I need to know
is you broke her heart again.

923
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,207
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I am ashamed of myself, man.

924
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,527
All right, but you don't
make it easy, Elliott.

925
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:05,080
Every time I come around,
you just rain down hate on me, man.

926
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,600
- It makes it hard to come around.
- I'm sorry it's hard on you, Reggie.

927
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,603
You want to blame it all on me now?

928
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,843
That's a load of shit.
That's like a mile-high load of shit.

929
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,606
Man, I screwed up, OK?
I screwed up last night.

930
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,331
I couldn't come here and I couldn't
face up. All right? But I'm here now.

931
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,404
But you're not here, Reggie.
All right? You're not here.

932
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,766
You're not in the house.

933
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,248
You're out here in the street,
sitting on your car, doing what?

934
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,167
Huh? What, catching some rays?
Shaking off last night's buzz?

935
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,368
You can go to hell, Elliott.
I'm not going in there.

936
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,126
Is that it?
You just gonna walk away now?

937
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,767
I do you the favor,
let you make up with your daughter

938
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,251
and you're just gonna walk?

939
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,640
Is that what you do? You're gonna...

940
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,040
What, are you gonna sulk?

941
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,248
You gonna sulk
all the way back to Compton?

942
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,364
You're unbelievable. You know?

943
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,488
You not only broke
your little girl's heart,

944
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,961
but you're killing your mother.

945
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,481
You can't do any worse than that,
Reggie.

946
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,324
You know what? You need...

947
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,290
You need to quit acting like you're
some kind of little street nigger.

948
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,244
'Cause you're not.

949
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,641
You come from a good family.

950
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,528
- Morning, Elliott.
- Morning, Andrew, Bill.

951
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,008
My granddaughter's father.

952
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,449
Goddamn crackhead,
inconsiderate asshole!

953
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,931
Yeah!

954
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,369
- Hey, Uncle Vic.
- Hey, buddy.

955
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,561
<i> When you look in my direction</i>

956
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,647
<i> I can tell you feel it too</i>

957
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,368
<i> You could make a soul connection</i>

958
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,282
- Do you know who that is, Eloise?
- Is it my daddy?

959
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,171
Why don't you get out of the pool
and go say hello, baby?

960
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,562
<i> You got something I need to see</i>

961
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,644
<i> Oh, show me the honey... </i>

962
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,880
<i> It's not fun
unless I have you by my side</i>

963
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:00,568
<i> 'Cause you're beautiful </i>

964
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,202
<i> Babe I like your walk</i>

965
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,604
<i> Now see that girl
like a 747 coming in to land</i>

966
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,290
<i> Watch that baby maneuver</i>

967
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,525
- Uncle Vic, you seen Reggie?
- No, I sure haven't.

968
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,964
- How's the game?
- Oh, it's not good for the bookies.

969
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,044
Oh, my.

970
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,964
This is major.

971
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,849
You drew this?

972
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,923
You swear to me?

973
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:37,165
'Cause I think your grandfather must've
gone out and bought this somewhere.

974
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,684
- No. He didn't. It was me.
- You're a true talent.

975
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,171
That's good.

976
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,166
This skinny one right here,
is that supposed to be me?

977
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,891
- No.
- Mm.

978
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,162
That's not my favorite.

979
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,645
But it's good.

980
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,407
It's good.

981
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:03,007
- Dondi, have you seen Reggie?
- No, I haven't.

982
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,682
25 grand. OK?

983
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,683
25 grand to go away,

984
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,763
until you can get yourself
cleaned up for real.

985
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,009
Get off the drugs, pay back
whoever it is you need to pay.

986
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,525
Is that gonna do it?

987
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,923
Yeah. Yeah, that'll do it.

988
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:45,649
You either clean yourself up...
or you stay away from Eloise.

989
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,691
I am clean, Elliott.

990
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,161
This is just to pay some debts,
some trouble that I got myself into.

991
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:56,369
Just stop, please, all right? Just stop.
I can't take anymore.

992
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,965
Really, I can't take the bullshit.

993
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,885
You couldn't even be bothered
to stay awake out there.

994
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:05,170
All right? You need to get honest
with yourself, Reggie. All right?

995
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,129
You need...

996
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,567
You need to get your act together.

997
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,050
<i> Turbo powered automobile</i>

998
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,761
<i> I'd really like to have a look
what's under that hood</i>

999
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,402
<i> Black, red, white or yellow
It doesn't matter what's its shade</i>

1000
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,921
<i> I just like the way mama
how you work that thing </i>

1001
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,401
All right, Reggie,
give it to me straight.

1002
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,401
Because the judge
is gonna look you in the eye

1003
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,091
and ask you for it even straighter.

1004
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,084
How long you been clean?

1005
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,611
A while now.

1006
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,283
I... I been doing good, man.

1007
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:48,805
I been up in Seattle.

1008
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,486
Made a good group of friends,
like I was telling you, Mama.

1009
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,165
How you been taking care of yourself?

1010
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,290
Ah, man, just doing odd jobs, you know?

1011
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,408
Construction, shit like that.

1012
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,211
I don't think it's a good idea
to bring him into the mix.

1013
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,967
The judge will only see him
as a two-bit drug addict, not much more.

1014
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,885
Jeremiah, I'm clean, man.
I'm telling you, I'm clean now.

1015
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,122
I don't believe you.

1016
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,363
And if I don't believe you, the judge
sure as hell won't believe you.

1017
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,971
Jeremiah, you need to listen to me.

1018
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,088
This isn't about him doing drugs.

1019
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,651
He'll admit that he did 'em.

1020
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,646
Hell, he'll take a damn drug test.
He's already said that.

1021
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,246
He's changed.
And he just wants to be with his baby.

1022
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,927
He doesn't want to be with his daughter,
Rowena. That's the problem.

1023
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,771
- You do, he doesn't.
- That ain't completely true, Uncle J.

1024
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,161
Yes, it is!

1025
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,049
You're a goddamn cliche.

1026
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,931
You're a perfect stereotype.

1027
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,209
You don't even realize
the damage you do.

1028
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,442
Beyond the damage
you've done to that little girl.

1029
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,321
You corroborate everything
the white community thinks.

1030
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,451
You're a walking validation stamp
on all their bullshit.

1031
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,689
You are a father. Goddamn you, Reggie!

1032
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,842
You're a little girl's father!

1033
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,844
And there's some broken chromosome
in that thick head of yours

1034
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,601
that won't allow you to connect to that!

1035
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,290
- I ain't like you, man, OK?
- Right!

1036
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,680
- I'm not you!
- You're right!

1037
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,161
- I'm not you! All right?
- Reg...

1038
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,447
- Reggie, wait! Don't go.
- I'm done!

1039
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,011
- Don't go!
- Jeremiah.

1040
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,646
Now look,
if you wanna win custody from Elliott,

1041
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,280
it won't help bringing him into this.

1042
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,207
Now I say we go with my original brief,
you petition for custody.

1043
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,800
- He is the father.
- He doesn't want the job!

1044
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,371
Will you please tell her, Andrea?

1045
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,443
Auntie, you need to listen to him.

1046
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,329
- Mm-mm! Mm-mm!
- He's right.

1047
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,281
- Don't give me that look.
- I'm not giving you a look.

1048
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,567
I don't care how many law degrees
you went and got,

1049
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:38,600
doesn't give you the right
to give me that look.

1050
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,569
There it is again. I mean it.

1051
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,451
Now I'll get Daddy on the phone
and he'll tell you what's what.

1052
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,965
Giving me a look.

1053
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,729
Oh, is that what you want?

1054
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,882
You want a call coming in
from your dad? You know what?

1055
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,405
Let me just get him on the phone.

1056
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,800
You know what, Rowena?

1057
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,566
You're damn hard to take.
Always have been.

1058
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,203
And I have to say this,
you're not getting any goddamn easier.

1059
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,562
I was going to the water well
one day for my mother.

1060
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,927
It's a everyday activity.

1061
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,163
So I was walking back to my village
and I could hear something in the bushes

1062
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,926
and I turn around and a gazelle
was headed in my direction.

1063
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,242
- I gotta take this.
- Of course, of course.

1064
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,164
I started to...

1065
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,368
Well, of course,
I started to run very, very fast.

1066
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,561
What's up?

1067
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,085
<i>They've refiled
under a different chain.</i>

1068
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,971
- What?
- It's Reggie's complaint now.

1069
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,282
Filing for full parental custody.

1070
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,647
- No, how can that be?
- <i>Gets</i> worse.

1071
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,441
They submitted to the court a copy
of a check Reggie cashed for $25,000

1072
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,647
made out from you.

1073
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,926
<i>It's gonna play really badly</i>

1074
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,327
<i>if you were trying to bribe him
to walk away from his daughter.</i>

1075
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,720
<i>I think you better come in tomorrow.</i>

1076
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,247
We need to discuss this as a group.

1077
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,164
It's about to go real bad, real fast.

1078
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:45,970
All right, thanks.

1079
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,528
So I'm running very, very fast

1080
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,246
with having these three gazelles
chasing me down.

1081
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,641
- Did not know what to do.
- Are you OK, Papa?

1082
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,325
Yes, I am.

1083
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,364
Duvan, I was thinking maybe...
you could teach me a language.

1084
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,887
Sure. Which language?

1085
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,088
I don't know. You just pick.

1086
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,487
Papa, are you being silly?

1087
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,123
No. I think he is being very serious.

1088
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,731
I think he needs to learn a new trick.

1089
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,128
It wasn't a goddamn bribe, all right?
He asked for the money.

1090
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,921
I gave it to him in the hopes
that he'd get his act together.

1091
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,801
- Whatever it was, it was a bad move.
- Mm-hm.

1092
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,122
Yeah, puts us in a tough situation.

1093
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,521
We need to think about
how this is gonna play in court.

1094
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,364
Play in court?

1095
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,560
You got a young black kid
who's cleaned up his act,

1096
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,968
he's got a sweet little mother
and her little niece,

1097
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,010
and all the little cousins,
and here comes Mr. Big...

1098
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,010
Big ol' white guy with a checkbook,
bossing everybody around.

1099
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,931
That's the story
they're gonna tell right there.

1100
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,168
This isn't about black and white,
all right?

1101
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,086
This is about right and wrong,
all right? He's a drug addict.

1102
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,481
Look, we know that, Elliott.

1103
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,324
And she's gonna know it
before we're done.

1104
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,051
You just, you gotta keep your cool.

1105
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,248
This isn't gonna be one of those times

1106
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,041
where you can just bulldoze
through everything, Elliott.

1107
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,729
- What did you just say to me?
- Hey, Elliott, hang on.

1108
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,211
We're all on the same team here, guys.

1109
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,727
He destroyed my daughter, Eldridge.
He destroyed my little girl.

1110
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:29,646
I'm not gonna let him
do the same to my granddaughter.

1111
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,045
We're gonna go in there and we're gonna
remind this judge who Reggie Davis is.

1112
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,049
We're gonna use his criminal record.

1113
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,890
You're gonna need to bring it up
every third sentence.

1114
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,084
We're gonna make this guy
wear it like a badge!

1115
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,725
You start attacking this kid

1116
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,161
- and the game is already over.
- Oh, for the love of God.

1117
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,004
- He's not a kid.
- Look, Elliott...

1118
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,401
He's 30 years old.

1119
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,565
Nobody is arguing with you here.
It's just the world we're living in.

1120
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,207
We're just not gonna get away with
making it about him.

1121
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,925
If it isn't about him,
then it's gonna be about me.

1122
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,090
- Eloise!
- Mr. Elliot, I am here.

1123
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,602
Mr. Elliott, her father came.

1124
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,082
He took her and he say
he will bring her back by dinner.

1125
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:39,447
But I didn't know what to do.

1126
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,405
It's OK.

1127
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,166
Hey!

1128
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,051
What the hell are you doing?

1129
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,121
Don't you ever come into my house again
without my permission. You hear me?

1130
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,441
And don't you come anywhere
near that girl again anywhere,

1131
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,523
unless I have plenty of warning
about it, you understand?

1132
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,648
- She's my daughter, man.
- Did you hear what I just said?

1133
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,086
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

1134
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,361
Good.

1135
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,284
- What the hell was that about?
- I got no idea.

1136
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,851
All right?
I was up there having some laughs

1137
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,809
and the dude came out of nowhere
and attacked me. All right?

1138
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,803
I told you,
he's a special kind of crazy.

1139
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,246
You told me you had permission
to go get her.

1140
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,681
- I got permission from the maid.
- The maid?

1141
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,851
Mama, I just...

1142
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,600
l just wanted to be with her.

1143
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,160
What the hell were you doing up there
with them if you wanted to be with her?

1144
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,921
Why aren't you over there with her,
baby?

1145
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,405
I don't know.

1146
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,321
So sweet of him to bring Eloise over
for a crack-smoking field trip.

1147
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,847
But she has to get home now
and do her homework.

1148
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,968
There's no crack-smoking going on,
Elliott.

1149
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,726
Just beautiful music. Don't come here
talking to me about crack-smoking.

1150
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,882
Your son had no right to come in
and take her from my house.

1151
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,440
He told me you gave him permission.

1152
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,166
Well, your little angel lied, all right?

1153
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,806
I'm gonna file a motion
with the court tomorrow

1154
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,121
and get a restraining order against him.
He's a junkie.

1155
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,851
- My son is not a junkie.
- He's a crack junkie, Rowena.

1156
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,685
- He never got over his daddy dying.
- Oh, please.

1157
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,808
He's overcome that now, but...

1158
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,525
He's gonna shine, Elliott.
Just wait and see.

1159
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,125
He's gonna shine.
He's gonna make us all proud.

1160
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,045
Well, you must've been pretty proud
when he paid you all back then, right?

1161
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,601
What are you talking about, Elliott?

1162
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,770
The $25,000 check
that you're all worked up about.

1163
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,129
You know, the bribe?
That was for debts, Rowena.

1164
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,650
How much of that did you see?
How much did any of you see?

1165
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,246
You live in a blind spot
when it comes to your son.

1166
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,366
Yeah? Why don't you just run on home
and have yourself a drink?

1167
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,727
Good idea. You know, I think I will.

1168
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,531
My son is not a junkie!
And you're a drunk!

1169
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,808
- OK, thank you!
- Just run on home,

1170
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,406
fill your bathtub with whiskey
and just soak in it.

1171
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,767
Have yourself an old drunk man's
bubble bath!

1172
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,928
- Got it!
- Good!

1173
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,722
- Papa!
- What?

1174
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,609
A mus!

1175
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,521
Wow! An A plus. Look at that!

1176
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,529
Someone's been doing their homework.

1177
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,730
Someone's been doing their homework!

1178
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,286
Too fast.

1179
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,810
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.-</i>

1180
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,691
I was out walking by, saw the light on.
What are you doing?

1181
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,287
- Um... Learning French.
- Why?

1182
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,647
Well, it's either that or get drunk,
I guess.

1183
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,290
That's the most insane thing
I've ever heard.

1184
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,602
- Yeah.
- Going to AA isn't easier than trying

1185
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,603
- to learn that shit? Gotta be kidding.
- OK, all right.

1186
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,843
Let me put some pants on, all right?
Come on in.

1187
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,567
Kristen! Where's your brother?

1188
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,404
I told him
I wanted to get to court early.

1189
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,483
Give that judge a pretty picture
to look at.

1190
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,006
Here.

1191
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,281
Reggie!

1192
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,609
All right, brother.

1193
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,483
Just having a cigarette,
trying to get my head together.

1194
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,445
You know, the truth is, Mama, I don't
think I can handle this, all right?

1195
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,682
Jeremiah just need
to get it put off or something.

1196
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,649
What are you talking about?

1197
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,007
It's too much, all right?

1198
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,527
I can't sit up there
in front of a judge and a jury.

1199
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,605
There's no goddamn jury, boy. Wake up!

1200
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,760
You got to go in there
and fight for your daughter.

1201
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,050
Look, I can't do it! All right?
I can't do it.

1202
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,726
Now she need to just
stay up there where she is.

1203
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,884
Look, I wanna do it, Mama. I do.

1204
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,646
I keep trying, but I can't.

1205
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,365
All right? Jeremiah said it himself.

1206
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,171
I'm not right that way.
There's something missing.

1207
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,163
Shut your mouth!

1208
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,407
Today is not the day
for you to lose sight of what's real.

1209
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,769
This is a little girl's life
we're talking about.

1210
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,400
She has a family.

1211
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,881
She has a father.

1212
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:02,325
And unless you let her know right now
that she's worth fighting for,

1213
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,882
she'll never feel in her little heart
that she's worth a damn.

1214
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,207
You understand?

1215
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,329
All of you.

1216
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,245
You're all precious and perfect,

1217
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,644
and every one of you would be worth
whatever the fight was to keep close.

1218
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,931
We don't want anything else
out of this cranky-ass old man,

1219
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,924
not one cent, not one concession,
you hear me?

1220
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,801
We just want our blood close.
Your blood, Reggie.

1221
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,127
Now she needs to be good with you.

1222
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,051
She needs to be in your life, baby,
making you whole.

1223
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,526
That's why you're so sick.

1224
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:43,127
That's why you're so broken.

1225
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,603
I love you. OK?

1226
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,122
Now pull yourself together.

1227
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,284
Pull yourself together!
You got a job to do.

1228
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,761
Probably should've been doing that
a lot more while you were growing up.

1229
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,365
We wouldn't be in this situation.

1230
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,206
Mr. Davis, when was the last time
you saw your daughter?

1231
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,931
About a month or two ago.

1232
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,889
How did she seem to you at that time?

1233
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,849
She seemed good.

1234
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,727
A little lonely.

1235
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,601
Kinda lost, maybe like she wanted
to say more, but thought she couldn't.

1236
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,603
Say more about what?

1237
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,523
I guess about living
with her granddaddy or something.

1238
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,444
Uh, Your Honor? Your Honor, if I may?

1239
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,161
Eloise has had 9 sessions
with the state's child therapist

1240
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,004
and the Jeffers' stipulated
psychiatrist.

1241
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,441
Not one of those reports came back
that Eloise was a child

1242
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,962
who didn't feel safe enough to
say what was on her mind on any subject.

1243
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,281
Move along, Counselor.

1244
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,169
Thank you.

1245
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,005
Mr. Davis,
just so the court has it straight,

1246
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,209
you do have a criminal record,
is that correct?

1247
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,840
Yes, sir, I do.

1248
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,530
Robbery, drug possession, assault,

1249
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,366
drug possession with intent to sell.
Did I leave anything out?

1250
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,524
No, sir. That's... that's about it.

1251
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,651
Mr. Davis, at one point,
you were smoking crack every day.

1252
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,043
- Is that correct?
- Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

1253
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,362
And why do you think that was?

1254
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,683
What do you think led you
to taking all these drugs?

1255
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,560
<i>I think I...</i>

1256
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,964
I guess I just...

1257
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,649
I don't know, man. I don't know.

1258
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,165
Emotional pain. Emotional...

1259
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,970
He was in pain, Your Honor.

1260
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,884
He let his family down, he lost his way.

1261
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,761
The drugs were a way for the boy
to hide the pain of losing his daddy

1262
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,008
and letting his family down.

1263
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,607
Ms. Jeffers?

1264
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:46,411
You open your mouth like that again,
you'll leave this room.

1265
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,403
You may even have handcuffs on.

1266
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,801
Counselor, I'm not kidding, not one bit.

1267
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,485
As impossible as the task may be,

1268
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:57,043
you're gonna have to figure out
a way to control her, OK? Go on.

1269
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,568
How long have you been
clean from drug use, Reggie?

1270
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,324
About 2 years.

1271
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,563
I've been up in Seattle,
rebuilding my life.

1272
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,923
Building a path back to my girl,
to my family.

1273
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,684
And you have a job now, is that correct?

1274
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,729
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I work with my mother now.

1275
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,565
She, uh, she has a real estate business.

1276
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,246
She does some ad sales.
Plus, she got a website business.

1277
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,329
Actually, she's got like 6 businesses.

1278
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,565
So, Reggie, at this time, do you feel
that you are able to take over

1279
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:27,087
the care and guidance of your daughter?

1280
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,361
No.

1281
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,286
I mean...
I mean, not yet, Your Honor.

1282
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,284
I think if she lived with my mother,
and I get some help from my sister

1283
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,126
and her wife across the street
while I continue my rehabilitation,

1284
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,601
I can slowly grow into a relationship,

1285
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,804
be the daddy and all that,
that I need to be.

1286
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,444
Thank you, Reggie.

1287
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,284
That's all for now, Your Honor.

1288
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,363
Little man, come here.

1289
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,289
One second, Your Honor, please?

1290
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,084
Call for a lunch break.

1291
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,084
He looks... like he needs some air.
He looks a little fidgety.

1292
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,720
We can't do that now. It's too early.

1293
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,081
If we call for lunch,
it'll just underline to the judge

1294
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,931
- how hard all this is on him.
- He needs a break.

1295
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,129
- We can't do that.
- Call for a break.

1296
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,687
Rowena, you are damn hard to take.

1297
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,325
Your Honor, we were wondering
if we could break early for lunch now

1298
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,006
before counsel takes
its testimony from Mr. Davis?

1299
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,600
Mr. Reynolds, any problem with that?

1300
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,325
We want to cross now.

1301
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,324
All right, I'm worried the judge is
gonna see that as you being belligerent.

1302
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:32,721
Now is not the time
to go light on this guy.

1303
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,247
I have a question I want him to answer.

1304
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,970
He wants to go with this.

1305
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,929
No, Elliott, no.

1306
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,970
No, not after lunch.
Now. I want to ask him now.

1307
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,966
Uh, Your Honor, seeing as how thorough
Mr. Davis' lawyer has been,

1308
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,650
we only have a couple of questions.

1309
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,401
So if we can just
move ahead of schedule,

1310
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,840
we feel we can get to Mr. Anderson's
testimony after lunch.

1311
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,365
That's fine. Go ahead.

1312
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,127
Mr. Davis, you have a tenth grade
high school education.

1313
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,881
You can read pretty good, is that right?

1314
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:10,051
Yeah. Yeah, I read fine. I just...
I don't have time and all, but...

1315
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,202
And how is your spelling?

1316
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,249
I'm OK with my spelling.

1317
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,042
OK, so, how would you
spell the name... Eloise?

1318
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,486
Your Honor, please, this has
nothing to do with why we're here.

1319
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,206
I want to hear him spell it.

1320
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,530
Go ahead, Mr. Davis,
spell your daughter's name.

1321
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,681
<i>OK.</i>

1322
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,807
Um...

1323
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,885
<i>L...</i> Right?

1324
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,771
L-O-E-Z-E.

1325
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,085
Eloise.

1326
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,770
- OK, Mr. Reynolds, anything else?
- No, Your Honor. Thank you.

1327
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,763
That's lunch.

1328
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,410
All rise.

1329
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,966
- How old are you, Mr. Araga?
- I am 19.

1330
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,088
And you are Miss Anderson's tutor?

1331
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,567
Yes, I tutor Eloise.

1332
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:18,284
Basic mathematics, division, Algebra,
introductory grammar skills.

1333
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,283
And I understand you speak languages.

1334
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,965
How many languages
do you speak, Duvan?

1335
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:27,160
Currently, uh, there are nine languages
that I would call myself fluent in.

1336
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,971
I have four others
that I struggle through.

1337
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,248
Your Honor, I have written a paper

1338
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,926
on language learning
as a system of tension release

1339
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,447
for the North American
Board of Mental Health Physicians.

1340
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,290
<i>OK.</i>

1341
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,805
Thank you.

1342
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,000
So, Mr. Araga, when you tutor Eloise,
where's her grandfather?

1343
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:50,006
- Is he in the other room?
- Oh, no. He is with us.

1344
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,480
- He is being tutored as well.
- He's right there with you.

1345
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,246
Yes, I have a combination package
on tutoring two people at once

1346
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,562
that I have worked out
with Mr. Anderson.

1347
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,291
So would you say that he is very
involved in Eloise's studying?

1348
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,329
Extremely involved.

1349
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,084
Would you say more or less
than the other parents

1350
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,049
- whose children you work with?
- Oh...

1351
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,646
I would say much, much more.

1352
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,401
Thank you.
That's all, Your Honor.

1353
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,890
Mr. Araga, what other services
do you provide for Mr. Anderson?

1354
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,922
I tutor Eloise, piano lessons,
and I am also sometimes his driver.

1355
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,651
Oh. Why does he need a driver?

1356
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:31,250
Sometimes, he will call me
to come and drive for him and I do.

1357
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,647
It is not on any of the lists
that I have given you,

1358
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,929
because it is not
a standard service that I offer.

1359
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:41,802
What condition is he in
when you are required to drive for him?

1360
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,410
I suppose maybe he is tired or...
has a lot on his mind?

1361
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,847
Does Mr. Anderson
have a drinking problem?

1362
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,245
I am not an expert on alcohol
or substance abuse detection

1363
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,767
or even addiction control issues.

1364
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,129
It is not something that I have
gotten into as a field of study

1365
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,691
for either work or recreation.

1366
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,571
Obviously not.
You haven't written a paper on it.

1367
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:14,491
Mr. Araga, have you ever
seen Mr. Anderson intoxicated?

1368
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,809
Mr. Araga?

1369
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,041
Yes, I have.

1370
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,286
Have you ever seen him intoxicated
in front of his granddaughter?

1371
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,403
He is currently learning French
as an alternative activity...

1372
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,360
Mr. Araga, have you ever
seen Mr. Anderson intoxicated

1373
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:43,091
in front of Eloise?

1374
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,287
Yes or no?

1375
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,850
- Yes.
- More than once?

1376
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,769
- Yes.
- Thank you, Mr. Araga.

1377
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,809
Your Honor, no further questions.

1378
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,160
All right, now Jeremiah's
gonna come after you.

1379
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,608
He's gonna do his best to try
to pick you apart, piece by piece, so...

1380
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,761
Really?

1381
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,564
Just, please, when you're on the stand,

1382
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,525
your number one job
is just to not lose your cool.

1383
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,849
Just stop, all right? Don't talk to me
like I'm a 2-year-old, OK?

1384
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,441
You know...

1385
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,963
l talked to my brother-in-law
about your drinking.

1386
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,124
He asked me how long
you've been drinking like this.

1387
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,642
I was like,
"I don't know, last couple years or so."

1388
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:42,001
You know, kind of since
your daughter, uh...

1389
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,931
And you know, how it got more serious
once Carol passed.

1390
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,521
- And you know what he said to me?
- No, what'd he say?

1391
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,644
He said,
"Maybe this guy's not an alcoholic.

1392
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:56,283
This guy, maybe he's just
one seriously angry motherfucker.

1393
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,602
Maybe he's just hopped up on anger."

1394
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,690
Well, if you are? if that is your drug
of choice, Elliott, I'm telling you,

1395
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,003
today is not the day
to go off on a bender.

1396
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,731
OK?

1397
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,491
And when was the first time
you met Reginald Davis Jr.?

1398
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,120
A couple of years
after Eloise was born.

1399
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,126
After we lost Jill, he came over
one day, wanted to talk to me alone.

1400
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,571
- What did he want?
- He wanted some money.

1401
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,245
That's what it usually is with Reggie.

1402
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,448
And for what purpose did he think
you were going to give him the money?

1403
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:36,286
I assume he wanted it in exchange
for not contesting custody of the baby.

1404
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,364
- Your Honor, that's wildly speculative.
- I agree.

1405
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,241
- Did he meet Eloise that day?
- No, I wouldn't let him in.

1406
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,449
He was a mess. I told him to come back
after he'd cleaned himself up.

1407
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:50,087
- Did he come back?
- A few weeks later, yeah.

1408
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,730
And had he cleaned up?

1409
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,204
More or less. He showed up...
He showed up with Rowena.

1410
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,880
- His mother.
- Yes.

1411
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,408
She basically dragged him there with
his ear in between 2 of her fingers.

1412
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,441
And how much time did they spend
with Eloise that day?

1413
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,126
Hour or so.

1414
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,408
Just long enough for Reggie
to steal a watch.

1415
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,690
How do you know he stole a watch?
Isn't that "wildly speculative"?

1416
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,087
No, his mother brought him back
with it the next day.

1417
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,561
Made him return it to me.

1418
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,001
When was the next time
you saw him?

1419
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,529
6 months or so later, he came over
in the middle of the night.

1420
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,042
About 3 a.m., wanted to take
the baby, said she was his.

1421
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,725
Wanted her right then and there.

1422
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,609
How would you describe
his condition that night?

1423
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,286
He was agitated.

1424
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,130
High. Stoned on something.

1425
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,004
And of course, you wouldn't
give him your granddaughter.

1426
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,083
- No, of course not.
- How did he handle that?

1427
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,442
He attacked me.

1428
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,761
Pulled a knife on me.

1429
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,604
How did that end up?

1430
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:54,482
I managed to cool him down.
Carol called the police. He ran.

1431
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,324
She called the police.
So there's a police report?

1432
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,244
Yes.

1433
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,971
- Did you press charges?
- No.

1434
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,521
Were there any more instances
like that again?

1435
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,681
Yeah, a couple.

1436
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,568
He has a tendency to get violent
for no reason when he's on drugs.

1437
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,171
How often did you see his mother?

1438
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,607
We'd see her a bit.

1439
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,764
She and Carol worked out
some form of a relationship.

1440
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:17,921
We were fine with her.

1441
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,448
Why is it you didn't meet Mr. Davis
until the baby was 2 years old,

1442
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,329
if your daughter had been dating him?

1443
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,801
I don't think he actually dated her.

1444
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,521
The term I'd use is.. abused.

1445
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,968
Mr. Anderson, don't confuse
your answer with an opinion. It's not...

1446
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,289
She was only 17 years old, Your Honor.
He was 23.

1447
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,602
We could very easily be using
a whole different term

1448
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,526
to describe that relationship, but we
didn't press charges there either.

1449
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,049
She was a goddamn baby.

1450
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,566
Mr. Anderson, how often have you been
to work since your wife passed away?

1451
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,242
Not a lot.

1452
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,885
I'm taking some time off.

1453
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,691
You've taken an emotional leave?

1454
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,849
Needed time to heal?

1455
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,729
If you did, that would make sense.

1456
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,167
The reason I haven't
been working is Eloise.

1457
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,209
So you think
it's better for you to be at home,

1458
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,771
help her with her studies.

1459
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,446
I do.

1460
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,280
And luckily,
you're in a financial position

1461
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,490
to be able to maintain the lifestyle
that you and Eloise enjoy?

1462
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:26,641
Yes.

1463
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,650
You're also in a financial position
that if need be,

1464
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,808
you can do this permanently?

1465
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,124
No?

1466
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,284
So eventually,
you'll be back to work full-time.

1467
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:40,641
Yeah.

1468
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,720
Your Honor, will you please instruct
the witness to answer these questions

1469
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,730
with yes's and no's?
We do have a transcript.

1470
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,486
Is that a yes or a no, Mr. Anderson?

1471
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,405
Yes, eventually,
I will have to go back to work. Yes.

1472
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:57,407
So all of this, all of the tutoring,
all of the full-time parenting,

1473
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,530
as good as it is, someday soon...

1474
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:04,086
things will be a lot different
for Eloise, right?

1475
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,483
You won't be able to devote to her
the energy that you have been,

1476
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,244
is that right?

1477
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,768
Please answer the question,
Mr. Anderson.

1478
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,730
I'd love to, Your Honor, but if he's
gonna continue to do it for me,

1479
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,928
- I might as well just sit down.
- OK, OK, OK. OK.

1480
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,162
This does not need to be that difficult.

1481
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,766
Counsel, you may want
to rephrase the question,

1482
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:27,482
and Mr. Anderson, you need to try not
to be so sensitive. All right?

1483
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:31,761
- Can he go on?
- Yes, he can go on.

1484
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,684
<i>OK.</i>

1485
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,810
Mr. Anderson, I'd like to submit
to you and the court

1486
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:41,010
that Reggie isn't gonna win the
Father of the Year Award anytime soon.

1487
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,603
- I don't think so, either.
- But he is Eloise's father.

1488
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:50,129
I've read the reports from her sessions
she had, and I know you did as well.

1489
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,001
This is a girl who hungers
for a relationship with her father.

1490
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:57,323
- Do you agree?
- I do. Especially now,

1491
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,131
since she's lost her grandmother.

1492
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,530
One of her grandmothers.

1493
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,442
Yes. One of her grandmothers.

1494
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,571
Mr. Anderson, how different would
you feel about Reggie's failings...

1495
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:16,365
if he were white?

1496
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,967
OK, here we go.

1497
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,369
Not one damn bit.

1498
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,205
All right? This isn't about
anything even close to that.

1499
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,249
I think you'd know better.

1500
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:34,248
Elliott, did you refer to Reggie...
as a "street nigger"?

1501
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:52,528
Yes, I did, once.
I was heated, but... yes, I did.

1502
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,889
It was a mistake.
I wish I hadn't done that, said that.

1503
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,008
You were heated,
but you did use the term.

1504
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,565
I just said I did.

1505
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,200
It's an ugly word,
and I'm ashamed that I used it.

1506
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,840
I know it's hurtful
and I shouldn't have, but...

1507
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,529
it's the word he used.

1508
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,451
It's how he referred to himself in all
his texts on her phone that I found,

1509
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,601
my daughter's phone.

1510
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,531
"Your street nigger's here, baby.
Come on out."

1511
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,691
"Your street nigger,"
that kind of thing, Your Honor.

1512
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,444
I know it doesn't make it right,

1513
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:26,201
but it was just in there,
lodged up here and it came out.

1514
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,250
In reality, though,
isn't that how you see him?

1515
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,406
A little drugged-out street nigger?

1516
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,928
Isn't that exactly to a tee
how you see Reggie?

1517
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,446
Mr. Anderson...

1518
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,447
do you dislike black people?

1519
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:56,483
Not all of them.

1520
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:00,842
Do you have a problem
with racial prejudice?

1521
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,245
Is that what you want to
make this about, Jeremiah? Really?

1522
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,607
Well, let's do it then.

1523
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,888
You've wanted to ever since
Rowena first dragged you into this.

1524
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:16,171
So yes, we're different, you and I.
You want to submit that? Submit it.

1525
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,646
We have different skin color.

1526
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,600
Is that the first thing I notice when I
see a black man, the color of his skin?

1527
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,924
Yes. Submit away.

1528
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,851
Because I can go ahead and submit
that it's the first thing you see

1529
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,361
when you see a white guy.
Now I don't know why that is

1530
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,444
any more than I know why
when I see a good-looking woman,

1531
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,763
the first thing I notice
are her breasts. Because I do.

1532
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,049
But if I move onto
my next thought quick enough,

1533
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:44,409
I'm not a pervert, all right?
I'm not a... I'm not a bad guy.

1534
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:47,809
I'm just... I'm just mildly flawed.

1535
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,084
It's the same thing with race.
It's not my first thought that counts,

1536
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,129
it's my second,
third and fourth thought.

1537
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:57,204
And each and every case I'm in,
it comes down to the same thing:

1538
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,323
the action and interaction I'm having

1539
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:01,642
with the person
that I'm interacting with.

1540
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,929
The interaction I've had with Reggie,
in case you haven't noticed,

1541
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,202
hasn't been all that great.

1542
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,170
And I don't need a math tutor to know
that it doesn't make me a racist

1543
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:13,005
just because he's a crack addict.

1544
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,009
That column doesn't add up.
It just simply totals him out as a...

1545
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,646
a drug-addled criminal,
a liar and a...

1546
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,600
a thief with no moral compass.

1547
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,004
He may be able to play you,
fool his mother,

1548
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,766
may be even able to
get one over here on Judge Cummins.

1549
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,447
But he can't fool me, because I see him
for exactly what he is.

1550
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:41,401
And to this day, he's never once
apologized or shown one bit of remorse

1551
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,882
to me or my wife
for the death of our daughter.

1552
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,122
All right?

1553
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,123
His mother wants to
mollycoddle him, fine.

1554
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,361
The whole world wants to treat him

1555
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,682
like a wounded, put-upon child,
then do it.

1556
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,444
I don't really care.

1557
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,002
I just don't want him infecting Eloise.

1558
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,931
So, no, Jeremiah,
I'm not racially prejudiced,

1559
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,368
I just don't happen to want your
little nephew's broken-down black ass

1560
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,286
anywhere near my granddaughter.
What's your next question?

1561
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,210
I don't think I have one.

1562
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:40,405
I don't think that went
as bad as you think it did.

1563
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,770
She'll make a ruling in a few days.
Who knows, she may even surprise us.

1564
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,241
I couldn't have been
a worse witness if I tried.

1565
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:52,085
No way in hell she's not gonna
take Eloise away from me.

1566
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,645
Not a shot in hell.

1567
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,768
Ah, come on, you were great.

1568
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,924
Not a lot of the other Klan members
could be that articulate.

1569
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,009
Time to turn
the lights out, Puppy.

1570
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:18,686
Want to see my new drawing?

1571
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:26,647
That's you, me and Daddy.

1572
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,450
You're very talented.

1573
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,091
Now lay down.

1574
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,643
- Did we do good in court today?
- We did OK.

1575
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,646
Did you tell the lady judge
that I only want to live with you?

1576
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,485
That I love Wee Wee and them,
but this is where I am?

1577
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,564
- Yes, I told her.
- Did she hear you?

1578
01:43:56,440 --> 01:44:00,206
- I think she did.
- Good.

1579
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:07,123
Son of a bitch.

1580
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:12,245
You better get your ass out of here
right now, Reggie.

1581
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,210
Give me money. A lot of money. 50.

1582
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,408
You make it 50 and
I'll go away for good this time.

1583
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,085
You need to leave right now.

1584
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:20,685
You give me the money
and I'll just go away.

1585
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:24,447
- You hear me? You need to leave now!
- Give me the money!

1586
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,444
- Or I'll take my daughter right now.
- Hell you will.

1587
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,206
Get out of here!

1588
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,088
You don't ever come over here
like this again! You hear me?

1589
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,969
Never, ever!

1590
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,288
All you're ever gonna do is hate on me.

1591
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,725
I know that.

1592
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:27,330
I ain't gonna never be nothing
but a street nigger to you. Never.

1593
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:17,681
<i>Oh...</i>

1594
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,727
Elliott! Elliott!

1595
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:58,565
Elliott!

1596
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,522
I'm so sorry, Elliott.

1597
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:40,124
I'm sorry about
you losing your little girl.

1598
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,926
God, I'm so sorry.

1599
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,561
I'm so sorry.

1600
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,644
I'm so sorry.

1601
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,809
OK, so, as you know, I was ready
to issue a custody ruling in this case,

1602
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:35,089
but I understand that both sides
would like to address the court

1603
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:38,961
with some additional information.
So, uh, let's first hear from Mr. Davis.

1604
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,249
Your Honor,
I just want to say that, um,

1605
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:47,086
the things that Mr. Anderson
said about me last week,

1606
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:50,642
they were hard to hear,
but they were true.

1607
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,610
I ain't fit just yet to be a father.

1608
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,286
I ain't no good to be around my girl.

1609
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:01,964
I need to go away, or something.
Get some air. Learn how to breathe.

1610
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:04,645
Figure out how to just...

1611
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,685
how to live like somebody
worth having a little girl lives like.

1612
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,808
I don't want the custody.

1613
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,771
That's the real truth.

1614
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:24,286
Well... that is an interesting turn.

1615
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,171
So, um, Mr. Anderson,

1616
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:29,766
I understand that you have something
I need to know as well,

1617
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:32,321
something about an incident
at your house?

1618
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,087
No, Your Honor,
there's nothing I need to...

1619
01:52:38,360 --> 01:52:40,249
nothing I need to say
at this point.

1620
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:45,491
OK, so, Counselor,
are you now back to asking me

1621
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:47,921
to give custody to your sister,
is that where we're going?

1622
01:52:48,040 --> 01:52:50,566
Yes, Your Honor, we'd like to revert
back to our original brief,

1623
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:54,167
asking that Rowena Jeffers
be given full custody of the child.

1624
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,130
- OK. Now...
- No.

1625
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,569
Your Honor, that's not what we want.

1626
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,321
I know I'm not supposed to just
stand up and blurt things out in here

1627
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,370
and I really don't want
to go to jail today, but...

1628
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:14,331
l need to say that I was wrong
about Eloise's grandfather.

1629
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:16,482
I need to say that right now.

1630
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:19,126
I believe he has
her best interest at heart.

1631
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,521
- You do?
- I mean, he's got himself a cranky side

1632
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:24,160
and he drinks too much,
which he needs to work on that, pronto.

1633
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,885
But I do trust him
with my granddaughter.

1634
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,520
I'm not going to jail
for saying any of this, am I?

1635
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,924
Not today. So you want to sit?
Yeah. There you go. Thank you.

1636
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,889
OK, now this is all very interesting.

1637
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:39,169
So Mr. Davis, are you sure
that this is what you want?

1638
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,049
To give sole custody to Mr. Anderson?

1639
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,931
Because this will not be easy
to rescind once it's...

1640
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,765
That's fine, Your Honor, that's fine.
We trust Elliott.

1641
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,166
You won't have to rescind anything.

1642
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,766
Reggie understands that, don't you,
Reggie? I mean, it's all good.

1643
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:53,491
- It's all good.
- OK. Thank you.

1644
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,365
I would... like him to stop
with the drinking, though.

1645
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:59,763
OK, you know what, Your Honor?
I do need to quit drinking.

1646
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,524
All right? I got it. But it's...

1647
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:04,809
And it's not easy,
so please tell her to...

1648
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,602
Tell her to mind her own business.
Please?

1649
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:12,525
Y'all done?

1650
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:15,244
I am.

1651
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:18,529
I'm ready to sit back down, Your Honor.

1652
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,806
Jesus.

1653
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,130
All right, Mr. Anderson, you now
have full custody of your granddaughter,

1654
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:35,571
Eloise Anderson, in accordance with
California Family Code, Section 3040,

1655
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,321
paragraph three.
And for your granddaughter's sake...

1656
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,927
Hey, Eloise!

1657
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:17,403
- Just for a while. You promised. Right?
- Yes.

1658
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,449
A couple of weeks.

1659
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:22,962
I just need to get some air, Puppy.
It won't be long.

1660
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,925
Papa just...

1661
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:29,730
Papa just needs to relearn
how to breathe.

1662
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:32,042
Work on some things.

1663
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,771
- You understand that, right?
- Yes.

1664
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:37,764
Duvan is gonna come and
take you to school every day, OK?

1665
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,482
He's gonna help you keep up
with your studies. All right? Good.

1666
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:46,565
That's a pretty good-looking bow
you have up there. Wonder who tied it.

1667
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:47,721
You did.

1668
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,804
That's right.

1669
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,123
Hey, you. Come here. Mm-mm.

1670
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,090
Wee Wee's got some love for you.

1671
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,561
Come on, come on.

1672
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:43,201
You about done?

1673
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:46,011
Uh, yes. Yes, I'm done.

1674
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:23,563
<i> You've got the best
of both worlds</i>

1675
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,205
<i> You're the kind of girl</i>

1676
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,762
<i> Who can take down a man</i>

1677
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:31,764
<i> And lift him back up again</i>

1678
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,083
<i> You are strong
but you're needy</i>

1679
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:37,846
<i> Humble but you're greedy</i>

1680
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,606
<i> And based on your body language</i>

1681
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:43,764
<i> And shoddy cursive
I've been reading</i>

1682
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,764
<i> Your style is quite selective</i>

1683
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:50,003
<i> Though your mind
is rather reckless</i>

1684
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:52,367
<i> Well I guess it just suggests</i>

1685
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:56,844
<i> That this is
just what happiness is</i>

1686
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,964
<i> And what a beautiful mess</i>

1687
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:06,444
<i> This is</i>

1688
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:14,047
<i> It's like picking up trash</i>

1689
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:19,240
<i> In dresses</i>

1690
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:22,603
<i> Well it kind of hurts</i>

1691
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:26,321
<i> When the kind of words you say</i>

1692
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,801
<i> Kind of turn</i>

1693
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,089
<i> Themselves into blades</i>

1694
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,164
<i> And "kind and courteous"</i>

1695
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:37,527
<i> ls a life I've heard</i>

1696
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:40,570
<i> But it's nice to say</i>

1697
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:43,451
<i> That we played in the dirt</i>

1698
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:46,365
<i> Oh dear</i>

1699
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:51,970
<i> 'Cause here we are</i>

1700
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:56,728
<i> Here we are</i>

1701
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:01,681
<i> Here we are Here we are</i>

1702
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:04,241
<i> Here we are</i>

1703
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:11,248
<i> Here we are</i>

1704
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:16,521
<i> Here we are</i>

1705
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:21,083
<i> We're still here</i>

1706
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:24,521
<i> What a beautiful mess</i>

1707
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:25,292
<i> This is</i>

1708
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,083
<i> It's like</i>

1709
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:36,810
<i> Taking a guess</i>

1710
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,921
<i> When the only answer is yes</i>

1711
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,687
<i> And through timeless words</i>

1712
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,810
<i> And priceless pictures</i>

1713
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:51,884
<i> We'll fly like birds</i>

1714
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,686
<i> Not of this earth</i>

1715
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,571
<i> And tides they turn</i>

1716
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:00,200
<i> And hearts disfigure</i>

1717
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,125
<i> But that's no concern</i>

1718
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,886
<i> When we're wounded together</i>

1719
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:09,123
<i> And we tore our dresses</i>

1720
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,931
<i> And stained our shirts</i>

1721
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:16,369
<i> But it's nice today</i>

1722
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,050
<i> Oh, the wait</i>

1723
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:25,081
<i> Was so worth it </i>
