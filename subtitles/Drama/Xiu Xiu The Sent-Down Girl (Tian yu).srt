<i>[Episode 44]</i>

00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,167
<i>Convey my decree.</i>

00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,739
<i>Behead Li Wei Young for the murder
of Princess An Le in three days.</i>

6
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:49,500
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

7
00:02:50,657 --> 00:02:51,823
Open the door.

8
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:52,823
- Yes.
- Yes.

9
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,248
You are all dismissed.

10
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:01,248
Yes.

11
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,502
What brings you here?

12
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,906
What exactly happened?

13
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,091
Why would you be accused
of Princess An Le's murder?

14
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,632
I've reminded you so many times
to act cautiously.

15
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:31,503
Why would you get involved
with Princess An Le?

16
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,856
How does that concern Your Highness?

17
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:37,097
The envoy of Rouran is using this matter
to cause a fuss.

18
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,989
He kept pressing Grandfather
for a verdict.

19
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:44,573
Grandfather is furious about it
and will vent his frustration on you.

20
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:45,832
So?

21
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:48,111
It is but a life that he takes.

22
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,685
Moreover, wouldn't you be pleased
that I get killed for it?

23
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,504
You can get rid of your impediment now.

24
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:58,949
You can live happily ever after
with Li Chang Le.

25
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:01,056
Wei Young, what nonsense is that?

26
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,634
Have I said anything false?

27
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,814
To you, I'm the murderer
who killed your mother.

28
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:08,187
I'm a despicable and heinous villain.

29
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,860
Li Chang Le is beautiful,
gentle, and virtuous!

30
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,669
What are you doing here
instead of with her?

31
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,944
Are you here to bade me farewell?

32
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,680
- Wei Young, listen to me...
- Don't!

33
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,894
I don't want to hear a word!

34
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,024
Wei Young.

35
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,869
Have you no trust in me anymore?

36
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:35,937
Am I that unbearable to you?

37
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,730
Have you trusted me?

38
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:42,783
I kept telling myself again and again

39
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,399
that you have every reason
not to trust me.

40
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:48,089
I can't blame you. I shouldn't hate you.

41
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:52,572
But I wanted so much for you to trust me.

42
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,535
Trust in who I am.

43
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:58,466
There's no need for witnesses
or evidence. Just believe me.

44
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,442
Just believe in what I am!

45
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,178
Believe every word I say!

46
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,021
But you didn't! You didn't at all!

47
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,168
You still married Li Chang Le.

48
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:15,005
Wei Young... I'm sorry.

49
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:17,115
I truly never wanted to hurt you.

50
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,007
Please believe me.

51
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,428
I'm really here to help you.

52
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:23,007
How could you
when you don't believe me at all?

53
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:26,632
I don't wish to place my hopes
on a man who doesn't trust me!

54
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:30,314
You may leave now, Your Highness.

55
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,141
I never want to see you again.

56
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:36,553
We'll just pretend that nothing
ever happened between us.

57
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,767
You...

58
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,509
Are you never ever going to see me again?

59
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,300
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

60
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,326
No matter what you say,
I won't leave you.

61
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,271
- Let go of me.
- I already did that once.

62
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,266
I don't ever want to
go through that agony again.

63
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,255
Li Wei Young, listen.
I will never let you go again.

64
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,713
Do you know what you're saying?

65
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,089
Listen to me, Li Wei Young!

66
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,346
You have me wrong.

67
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,663
You're the most precious person to me.

68
00:06:14,663 --> 00:06:16,565
How could I not believe you?

69
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,545
I know that you're innocent.
I knew it all along.

70
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,091
I never stopped loving you.

71
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:29,797
I know that... you didn't kill my mother.

72
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:35,216
And I was forced into
marrying Li Chang Le.

73
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,244
This is the truth.

74
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:49,951
I used Li Chang Le to lure out Tuoba Yu.

75
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,879
They are the real culprits
who had my mother killed.

76
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,137
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

77
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:03,464
Tuoba Yu is one shrewd man.

78
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,694
He is very powerful.

79
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,449
Once he senses anything suspicious

80
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,778
he might do anything to take me down
just to get the throne.

81
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:17,648
If so, hundreds of people in
my household would be in peril.

82
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:22,598
As for you, it's likely that
you'd be in danger again.

83
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:27,261
Hence, I opted to act powerless
and slowly built up my power

84
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:30,432
away from the limelight so as
to pounce at the right time.

85
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:33,052
However, I have no other choice
but to tell you the truth now.

86
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,240
I can only save you
if you believe me.

87
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,672
You actually believed me all this time.

88
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,658
But in the beginning...

89
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,291
My mother's death dealt
a huge blow to my heart.

90
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:51,021
But then when I went over the case,
I spotted many questionable factors.

91
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,718
Grandfather wanted you dead.

92
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,661
I really had no other choice
but to make a pact with Tuoba Yu

93
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:59,088
and ended up marrying Li Chang Le.

94
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,702
Wei Young, do you know how upset I was
when I saw you at the wedding?

95
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:12,199
When I had to hurt you
in order to win Li Chang Le's trust

96
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,053
I was in such agony.

97
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,218
But what pained me the most
was that I was so helpless.

98
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,819
I could only watch you suffer
without doing anything to help you.

99
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,857
Before I'm capable of protecting you

100
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:27,684
distancing myself from you was
the best protection I could offer.

101
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:32,610
It really was you who has been
protecting me in secret.

102
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:37,677
I was framed for poisoning the empress

103
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:40,014
and I was really puzzled
about how swiftly

104
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,267
Ninth Princess discovered the evidence
to prove Madam Lin framed me.

105
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,929
And the other time when
I was nearly killed near the well

106
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,123
you didn't happen to just pass by.

107
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:51,913
You came over especially to rescue me.

108
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:55,500
I guessed that Prince of Dongping
would try to kill you.

109
00:08:56,591 --> 00:09:00,778
But I still didn't make it in time
to save Bai Zhi.

110
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:08,226
After Bai Zhi was killed, I heard someone
playing the zither for me all night.

111
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,394
It really was you.

112
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:18,803
I should have stayed by your side
to comfort you when you were upset.

113
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,037
But that was all I could do then.

114
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:22,836
I'm sorry, Wei Young.

115
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:25,094
I made you suffer so badly.

116
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,044
Will you forgive me?

117
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:30,097
You have thought of me so much.

118
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,354
How could I possibly blame you?

119
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,874
I was the one who kept
holding a grudge.

120
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:37,422
I hated you.

121
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,626
I even said such hurtful words to you.

122
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,330
Do you blame me?

123
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,840
Silly woman.

124
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,212
Only when there is love
could there be hate.

125
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:53,418
Doesn't that mean you still love me?

126
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:10,914
In this lifetime, how could I
love anyone else but you?

127
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,176
What about Li Chang Le?

128
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:28,408
Despite everything,
she is already your wife.

129
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,653
I've never loved Li Chang Le.

130
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,850
Nothing ever happened between us.

131
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,392
Since I discovered that
she was behind my mother's death

132
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:41,625
how could I still treat her as my wife?

133
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,706
Once I have the evidence

134
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:48,304
I will report to Grandfather
to punish her as she deserves.

135
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,500
What matters the most now
is proving your innocence.

136
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,196
I believe that you would never
kill Princess An Le.

137
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:00,063
Wei Young, we've pulled through
so many obstacles together.

138
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:04,144
I'm sure that we will
get through this safely too.

139
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,059
Try to recall some details from
the time you met Li Chang Ru.

140
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,364
Perhaps we might find some evidence.

141
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:33,192
Young Mistress!

142
00:11:34,938 --> 00:11:36,053
What's the matter?

143
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:37,596
I'm fine.

144
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,116
It was just a prick.

145
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:43,479
Young Mistress,
after Li Wei Young is killed

146
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:46,057
will Prince of Nan-An really
bury you alive with her?

147
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:53,889
Prince of Nan-An is a man
of great ambitions.

148
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:56,750
Li Wei Young just bewitched him.

149
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,217
Once she is dead,
he will come to his senses.

150
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:05,596
He will then know
whom he should truly care about.

151
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,292
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.

152
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:12,282
Prince of Nan-An is a cold-blooded man.
He's not the right spouse for you.

153
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:15,360
Young Mistress, shouldn't you
plan a way out of this?

154
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,947
Once I've made my choice,
how is there any way out of it?

155
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,464
The prime of my youth...

156
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:27,903
All of my affection...

157
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:30,092
Every effort I made...

158
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,900
They were all devoted to this man.

159
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,344
How is there any way out for me?

160
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:48,649
I'd like to see how Li Wei Young
could make it out of this alive.

161
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,081
If you hadn't testified for me

162
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:54,268
it wouldn't have gone so well.

163
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,804
You're right.

164
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:58,663
Li Wei Young is our mutual enemy.

165
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:03,215
I felt such joy in seeing
my enemy defeated.

166
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:07,918
What is it? You don't seem well.

167
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,542
Li Wei Young will soon be executed.

168
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,076
Aren't you happy about it?

169
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:16,267
Since the outcome is as expected,
it's no pleasant surprise.

170
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:19,682
You're getting better every time.

171
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:21,904
I'm just curious.

172
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:26,583
How did you kill Princess An Le?

173
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,326
I didn't kill her.

174
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,753
Why would you lie to me?

175
00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:36,341
How could it not be you?

176
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:41,865
Everything is closely connected
and you're even her alibi.

177
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,042
As long as you're pleased
with the outcome

178
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,417
why would the process
be any concern of yours?

179
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,563
<i>[Imperial Dungeon]</i>

180
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:08,000
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

181
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:22,595
Wei Young.

182
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,019
Don't worry.

183
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,246
Listen to me.

184
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,875
You'll be executed in two days.

185
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:31,565
I couldn't think of any way to save you.

186
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,490
You're going to save me?

187
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,005
Of course.

188
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:39,566
If you die, I...

189
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,019
Whom am I to marry?

190
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:45,022
I'm already in this predicament.

191
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,629
I'm in no mood for your jokes.

192
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,614
All right.

193
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,015
I'll cut to the chase.

194
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:55,038
The only way to save you is
to get you a substitute.

195
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:56,953
You're going to swap prisoners?

196
00:14:58,052 --> 00:14:59,390
This is no trivial matter.

197
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:03,309
Compared to your life,
nothing else matters as much.

198
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,541
I have already chosen
the suitable prisoner.

199
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,235
She will be sent in tomorrow.
By then, it will all be arranged.

200
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:10,607
Don't tell anyone.

201
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:11,969
Just follow my orders.

202
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,109
Your Highness need not worry.

203
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:17,234
I will be fine.

204
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,576
You're in the Imperial Dungeon.

205
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,634
You're still so confident?

206
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:23,774
Yes.

207
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:28,615
I still have much left to do.

208
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:31,489
Interesting.

209
00:15:39,383 --> 00:15:41,868
Once we take out Li Wei Young

210
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:44,297
it's about time to tackle Li Chang Ru.

211
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,480
Unfortunately, that woman
is as cunning as a fox.

212
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:52,349
She refused to tell me the details
of Princess An Le's murder.

213
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:56,693
Otherwise, I would then
have something on her.

214
00:15:56,693 --> 00:16:00,606
Isn't Miss Chang Ru on your side?

215
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,519
She will marry Prince of Nan-An.

216
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,173
If I still collaborate with her

217
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:11,022
am I to assist her
in going against my own husband

218
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,846
to help Prince of Nan-An
seize the throne?

219
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,346
That won't do.

220
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:17,182
His Majesty thinks highly
of His Highness.

221
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:20,557
The throne should surely be
passed down to His Highness.

222
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:24,937
Your Highness, that will make you
the empress, mother of the nation.

223
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,953
Madam Chiyun had your destiny foretold
as the future empress.

224
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,357
It's now coming true.

225
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:34,041
However, Li Chang Ru
is no ordinary woman.

226
00:16:34,748 --> 00:16:36,375
If we are to tackle Prince of Nan-An...

227
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,990
we will have to get rid of her first.

228
00:16:58,793 --> 00:16:59,793
Li Wei Young.

229
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,351
His Majesty wishes to see you.

230
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,828
Greetings to Your Majesty.

231
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,596
This woman is to be executed tomorrow.

232
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:26,510
Why is she summoned to the palace today?

233
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,998
Don't be so anxious.

234
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,090
I shall clear your doubts soon.

235
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:37,152
Li Chang Ru, do you still
adhere to your testimony?

236
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,277
At noon on the day of the murder

237
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,506
you didn't see Li Wei Young.

238
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,576
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:49,193
At that time, you were out
with Princess Consort of Gaoyang?

240
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:50,926
Yes.

241
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,140
Your Majesty, what are you trying to say?

242
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,171
Nothing.

243
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:59,913
It's just that I've found a witness
to prove Li Wei Young innocent.

244
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:01,595
A witness?

245
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:02,595
Where is that witness?

246
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,669
Summon the witness!

247
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:22,594
Greetings to Your Majesty.

248
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:23,924
Princess!

249
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,892
You... You're not dead?

250
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,346
Prince Yuan Lie.

251
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,980
Tell him what exactly happened.

252
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,103
Here's the story, Your Majesty.

253
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,599
I'm ashamed of it.

254
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,161
My sister wanted to sneak out
of the palace

255
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,277
but she was discovered by my guards.

256
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,603
Then she was brought to me.

257
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,311
Princess, what happened?

258
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,083
Did someone try to harm you?

259
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:48,906
Princess An Le.

260
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,854
If you still won't tell us the truth

261
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:54,700
I'll send a letter to
your father right away.

262
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,654
Let's see how he will punish you.

263
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:58,755
Please don't, Your Majesty.

264
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,988
I'll just be honest with you!

265
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,714
I never wanted to be a part
of this marital treaty.

266
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:06,624
Before I came to Great Wei,
I already had a sweetheart.

267
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:09,813
We made a plan to escape
when I got out of the palace.

268
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:14,596
I caused trouble quite a few times
in order to break the treaty.

269
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:16,949
Your Highness! How could you do so?

270
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,205
What about that corpse in the well?

271
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:23,169
I found the corpse of
a maid who had recently passed away.

272
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,634
I put her in my clothes
and dumped her in the well.

273
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:27,880
Then I had my maid announce
my disappearance.

274
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:32,205
I changed into the maid's outfit
that I prepared in the morning.

275
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,086
I fled to Cold Palace
(where concubines are banished).

276
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,944
I pretended to be ill
and avoided the search.

277
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:39,559
I heard that a batch of maids
were to be released today.

278
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,124
I had wanted to blend in with them
and sneak out.

279
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,626
Who knew that I would still get caught?

280
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,071
Security is airtight in the palace.

281
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,388
How is it just some place
you could come and go at will?

282
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:49,952
Your Majesty, please have mercy
on me and let me out of here!

283
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:51,728
I don't wish to be married off to Wei.

284
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:55,453
I believe that your princess doesn't
want to be married off to Rouran either.

285
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:58,003
There are many ways to establish
bonds between nations.

286
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:01,526
Why must women's happiness
always be sacrificed for it?

287
00:20:01,526 --> 00:20:03,054
Please have mercy on me!

288
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,031
Your Highness, how could you say that?

289
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,166
Envoy.

290
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,871
You should now know
what really happened.

291
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:11,778
The people of Wei
didn't murder your princess.

292
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:16,390
Your princess caused this
huge disturbance because of her escape.

293
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,269
She nearly caused
an innocent person to be killed.

294
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:25,003
But all sorts of evidence pointed
to Li Wei Young as the murderer.

295
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,226
Li Wei Young murdered me?

296
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,816
Of course not!

297
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,531
At that time, I saw Li Wei Young...

298
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,539
She was with her!

299
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,154
They were talking by East Corridor.

300
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,281
I saw them when I passed it.

301
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:41,781
Your Majesty, I...

302
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:42,978
Envoy.

303
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:45,228
In order to prevent Princess An Le
from escaping again

304
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:48,076
she will be under
our surveillance for now.

305
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,828
As for the marital treaty,
we shall leave it until later.

306
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:55,376
Yes, Your Majesty.

307
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,757
After all, we are to be blamed
for this accident.

308
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,688
I apologize to Your Majesty
on behalf of Rouran.

309
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:05,317
Your Majesty is very forgiving.
Please don't hold it against An Le.

310
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,442
Anyone there?

311
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:11,392
Take Princess An Le away
and attend to her.

312
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,979
Yes, Your Majesty.

313
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:21,163
I will take my leave now.

314
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,523
I will take my leave.

315
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:33,934
Li Chang Ru.

316
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,696
How dare you!

317
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,266
You dared to deceive the emperor?

318
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:39,296
It isn't so, Your Majesty!

319
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:40,829
It isn't so!

320
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:42,700
Summon Princess Consort of Gaoyang!

321
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:05,967
Greetings to Your Majesty.

322
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,871
Princess Consort of Gaoyang.

323
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,366
Answer me.

324
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,156
When Princess An Le went missing

325
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:14,421
when did you meet with Li Chang Ru?

326
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,693
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

327
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:21,684
Although I did chat with my cousin
in the Imperial Garden that day

328
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:24,823
I couldn't be certain
that it was noon.

329
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,951
But you sounded so positive.

330
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:30,518
You confirmed that
you met Li Chang Ru at noon.

331
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:34,038
It was because
I asked my cousin for the time.

332
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:37,448
Her maid misled me
by saying that it was noon.

333
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:43,383
Now that I think about it, my cousin
must have wanted to use me.

334
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,719
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

335
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:50,284
I was too quick to believe others.

336
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:53,190
I nearly got Wei Young killed.
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

337
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:54,952
All right.

338
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:56,180
You may leave.

339
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,567
No...

340
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,729
Li Chang Ru.

341
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:07,355
We were at least cousins once.

342
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,981
Why did you have to frame me?

343
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,093
Your Majesty!

344
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,266
This is a misunderstanding!

345
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,470
Your Majesty!

346
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,721
I wouldn't dare deceive Your Majesty!

347
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,335
A misunderstanding?

348
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,368
Do you take me for a fool?

349
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:22,295
Can you toy with me as you wish?

350
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:23,412
I...

351
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:26,218
Anyone there? Drag her out!

352
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,152
Please spare my life, Your Majesty!

353
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:35,034
For the sake of the Li family's
loyalty to Your Majesty

354
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:37,031
- please spare me!
- Drag her out!

355
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,902
Please spare me! Your Majesty!

356
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,510
- Go!
- Please spare me, Your Majesty!

357
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,848
Your Majesty!

358
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:46,096
You can't kill me because I'm carrying
Prince of Nan-An's child!

359
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,117
Your Majesty, Miss Li is indeed pregnant.

360
00:24:19,393 --> 00:24:21,316
- Step out.
- Yes.

361
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,108
Prince of Nan-An...
Is Li Chang Ru telling the truth?

362
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:30,298
Is it really your child that she carries?

363
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:37,730
Father, the child Li Chang Ru carries...

364
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:41,618
It's truly mine.

365
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,095
It was a moment's folly.

366
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:46,035
Please forgive me, Father.

367
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:52,991
Li Chang Ru, since you're carrying
the offspring of the imperial family

368
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,310
I will spare your life.

369
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,942
However, I would never accept
a daughter-in-law of such misconduct.

370
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:04,265
I shall decide on my verdict
after you have given birth to the child.

371
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,700
Thank you for sparing my life,
Your Majesty.

372
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:08,826
Anyone there?

373
00:25:08,826 --> 00:25:11,174
Take her away to be
settled in the palace.

374
00:25:11,174 --> 00:25:12,897
Attend to her carefully.

375
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:14,362
Thank you, Your Majesty!

376
00:25:28,422 --> 00:25:29,422
Li Wei Young.

377
00:25:30,338 --> 00:25:32,740
You have been greatly wronged.

378
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:36,571
Don't worry. I will seek revenge for you.

379
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,832
Now that Rouran has made
such a huge error

380
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:44,434
I have to use
this opportunity to punish them.

381
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:48,471
Otherwise, how could I face
the ancestors of Great Wei?

382
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,123
You mustn't, Your Majesty!

383
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,115
Why not?

384
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,077
Should this incident
be made known to the people

385
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:57,502
they will surely mock
Rouran and Princess An Le.

386
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,781
But then after all the jesting,
people would think that

387
00:26:01,781 --> 00:26:06,061
the mighty emperor was actually fooled
by a young princess of Rouran.

388
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,603
Grandfather, we mustn't let
Great Wei become a laughingstock.

389
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,357
That is for certain.

390
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:16,431
Why don't we just act
as if nothing has happened

391
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:19,415
and then whoever was marrying
will proceed as planned?

392
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:20,526
No!

393
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:26,357
Father... I already learned that
Princess An Le has a sweetheart.

394
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,952
She would even feign her death
to elope with him.

395
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:31,281
How could I marry someone like her?

396
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,917
Are we not to uphold the dignity
of Great Wei anymore?

397
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:35,977
Exactly.

398
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,179
We mustn't be humiliated by them.

399
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:39,901
<i>Father!</i>

400
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:41,785
Father!

401
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:46,945
Will Father really send me away
to suffer in that place?

402
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,550
Princess An Le was right.

403
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,159
Why must peace between nations
be attained by

404
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,156
the sacrifice of a woman's happiness?

405
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:56,952
Father, please!

406
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:58,720
Don't marry me off to that place!

407
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
Father!

408
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,558
Please reconsider carefully, Grandfather.

409
00:27:04,113 --> 00:27:05,888
Such a marriage alliance is meaningless.

410
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:07,683
Rouran isn't strong enough
to invade us now

411
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:09,617
but what happens
when their army is powerful?

412
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:11,864
Would they still care about
this marriage alliance?

413
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:16,366
Grandfather, please don't sacrifice
Aunt Di's happiness for nothing.

414
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,257
I don't want to be married off.

415
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,259
Father.

416
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,262
Your Majesty.

417
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,471
Since neither of the princesses
consent to this marital treaty

418
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:25,806
why doesn't Your Highness
just allow Ninth Princess

419
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,465
to stay with you
and keep you company?

420
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:28,996
Father.

421
00:27:30,703 --> 00:27:31,911
I don't want to be married.

422
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,128
Father.

423
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:39,640
Father.

424
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:42,828
Thank you, Father!

425
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,856
All right now, stop crying.

426
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:52,371
His Majesty isn't watching anymore.

427
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,561
I'm really sad!

428
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:57,685
My good nephew!

429
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,971
What you just said is fantastic!

430
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:01,702
I haven't doted on you in vain.

431
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,429
I'm lucky enough not
to have been scared to death

432
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:05,155
by participating in your daring plan!

433
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,153
I am grateful to
Sister Wei Young for saving me.

434
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,601
If it hadn't been for you

435
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,738
I'd surely have fallen for
Li Chang Ru's tricks!

436
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:39,558
Do you think that I don't understand
why you're deliberately acting up?

437
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:41,273
If you dare
hurt Wei Young again

438
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:43,137
don't blame me for
disregarding our kinship!

439
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,027
I just want to be with the man I love!

440
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,531
What wrong have I done?

441
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,595
Min De?

442
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,169
Wei Young!

443
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:58,893
Wei Young.

444
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:00,335
Here, slowly.

445
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,951
Take a seat first.

446
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,013
Slowly...

447
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,650
What brings you here?

448
00:29:15,108 --> 00:29:18,685
I came over here to tell you

449
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:22,824
that I suspect Li Chang Ru of
plotting against Princess An Le.

450
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,326
What nonsense are you talking about?

451
00:29:26,326 --> 00:29:27,863
An Le, shut up!

452
00:29:27,863 --> 00:29:29,394
Hear Wei Young out first.

453
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,710
Min De, how is
the favor I asked of you going?

454
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,523
I've looked up the entry and exit records

455
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:39,516
for the day of Bai Zhi's death
as you requested.

456
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,404
Li Chang Ru was indeed in the palace.

457
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,141
Judging from her entry and exit hours

458
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:46,627
there's indeed a possibility
that she murdered Bai Zhi.

459
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:50,733
That timid and gentle Li Chang Ru?

460
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:54,762
How could she be Bai Zhi's murderer?

461
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:56,763
How I wish it wasn't so.

462
00:29:57,676 --> 00:30:00,318
I've always treated her like a sister.

463
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:04,511
However, during this period of time,
so much evidence has been laid before me

464
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,244
that I have no choice but to believe it.

465
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:13,083
Also, I've noticed eunuchs
spying on Princess An Le.

466
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:18,291
Therefore, I'm worried that
Li Chang Ru's next target is you.

467
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,825
But... There's no animosity
between me and her.

468
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:24,962
It isn't exactly so.

469
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:27,737
I heard that before the marriage alliance

470
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:30,531
Li Chang Ru was also a candidate
for Prince of Nan-An's consort.

471
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,420
Hence, I suspect that
Li Chang Ru spread rumors

472
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,307
to make Your Highness misunderstand me.

473
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:41,358
Do you mean that she's using me
to get rid of you?

474
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:46,019
It was no secret that we had an argument.

475
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:48,512
If you now meet with a mishap

476
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:51,851
I will surely be the prime suspect.

477
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,766
By then, Princess An Le will be dead
and you'll be executed for murder.

478
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,838
Kill two birds with one stone.

479
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:01,222
It's going to be easy for her to become

480
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,606
Princess Consort of Nan-An
with her craftiness.

481
00:31:03,606 --> 00:31:07,307
Isn't she simply too scary?

482
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:12,156
Now that I'm already on my guard,
we will have to react cautiously.

483
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:18,433
It's just that Chang Ru was once
my closest sibling in Li Manor.

484
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:24,170
I wish that it all turns out
to be nothing more than my imagination.

485
00:31:27,997 --> 00:31:29,528
<i>Judging by Li Chang Ru's personality</i>

486
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:31,773
<i>she will surely make the next move.</i>

487
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:38,132
<i>Therefore, Min De, you must be sure
to protect Princess An Le in secret</i>

488
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:39,583
<i>to prevent her from being harmed.</i>

489
00:31:44,582 --> 00:31:45,663
Let's go.

490
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:48,727
Quickly!

491
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,723
Fortunately, it was nothing
more than a scare this time.

492
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,172
You are all way too daring.

493
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:19,005
If anything went wrong,
Princess An Le would be dead.

494
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,799
As long as the marital treaty could be
annulled, I'm willing to take the risk.

495
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,237
Wei Young.

496
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:30,448
Don't attempt anything risky
with them again.

497
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,489
I still have work to attend to.

498
00:32:32,489 --> 00:32:35,415
You've been tired these days as well,
so go and get some rest.

499
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,583
Aunt Di.

500
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,673
Princess An Le.

501
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:43,088
I will take my leave now.

502
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:49,627
Yuan Lie, can I go sightseeing?

503
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:51,633
Go on!

504
00:32:52,415 --> 00:32:53,567
I'll take my leave now.

505
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,190
Be careful.

506
00:32:56,005 --> 00:32:58,041
I've been meaning to ask you.

507
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,477
What now? Have you made up?

508
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,028
You don't blame him anymore?

509
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,976
I've misunderstood him all this time.

510
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,269
He has been secretly protecting me.

511
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:08,299
He has his own reasons.

512
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,135
I knew it.

513
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,839
How could he possibly
be so ruthless to you?

514
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,453
So it was indeed a misunderstanding.

515
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:17,300
Anyway, it makes me happy to
see both of you reconciled.

516
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,317
As of now, so much has changed.

517
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:22,445
We still have a long way to go.

518
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:25,545
Wei Young, thank you for
what you did this time.

519
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,180
We are family.

520
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,883
Why are you so polite?

521
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,952
If anyone is to be grateful

522
00:33:30,952 --> 00:33:32,433
it should be me.

523
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,186
If you hadn't been around to help me

524
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,968
I would never have been able
to expose Li Chang Ru.

525
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,078
I thought that she could
get a taste of her own medicine

526
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,354
but who knew

527
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,886
she and my brother are actually...

528
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,483
That even saved her life.

529
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,914
I'm so annoyed about it.

530
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:50,303
I've always trusted her so deeply.

531
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:55,005
Who knew that my trust in her
would get Bai Zhi killed?

532
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,540
So many other people were also harmed.

533
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,606
Wei Young, don't be too upset.

534
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:03,948
Moreover, I don't think that
she will just call it quits.

535
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:06,192
His Majesty might have
punished her

536
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:08,313
but no one can say for sure
what the future holds.

537
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:11,695
Besides, she is also one crafty woman.

538
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:14,302
Wei Young, you must be careful
from now on.

539
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,452
I already see her for who she really is.

540
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:20,112
Therefore, I won't allow her a chance
to hurt anyone else again.

541
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,163
Wei Young, are you all right?

542
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,965
I'm fine.

543
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,780
I seem to have been stung by something.

544
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,309
Stop right there!

545
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,163
What did you do to Wei Young?

546
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:40,945
Your Highness seems to have forgotten
about the promise you made to our Khan.

547
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,527
If you can't attain Wei's
"Chart of Six Elements in Army Defense"

548
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:46,458
you won't be able to
save Li Wei Young's life.

549
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,563
- Just now...
- Fret not, Your Highness.

550
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:51,969
Li Wei Young was but slightly stung.

551
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:54,268
If you put off the mission any longer

552
00:34:54,268 --> 00:35:00,626
I will carry out our Khan's orders
to use fatal hidden weapons on her.

553
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,128
Don't act recklessly!

554
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:07,206
"Chart of Six Elements in Army Defense"
is a confidential document.

555
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,005
How could I attain it easily?

556
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:11,396
I need some time.

557
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,764
It isn't that you don't have
enough time to do it.

558
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:19,833
You've wasted all your time
on Li Wei Young.

559
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:21,375
You...

560
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:24,789
If I didn't take your feelings
into consideration

561
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,797
why would I work with you to
put on an act before the emperor?

562
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:33,394
In my opinion,
you never intended to steal

563
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:36,626
"Chart of Six Elements in Army Defense"
for Rouran.

564
00:35:37,663 --> 00:35:38,663
You're right.

565
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:40,827
I don't.

566
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:44,273
The six elements are the key
to defending Great Wei against Rouran.

567
00:35:44,273 --> 00:35:46,092
Once the strategy is deciphered

568
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:48,280
Rouran would come barging right in!

569
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,822
By then, it would be a catastrophe
for the people of Great Wei!

570
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,688
You are of Rouran descent, not Wei!

571
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,416
You dumped me here!

572
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,304
You allowed me to be raised in Wei!

573
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,847
Yet now you're telling me that
I don't belong to Wei?

574
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,347
Why did you come looking for me?

575
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:08,315
Why would you force me to harm
those who raised me?

576
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,527
Our Khan had made plans!

577
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:13,387
He wanted you to take his throne!

578
00:36:13,387 --> 00:36:15,699
Once you attain "Chart of
Six Elements in Army Defense"

579
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:18,610
you can win over the support
of the officials with it!

580
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,320
My prince, why can't you understand
the great pains our Khan took?

581
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,081
I never wanted the throne!

582
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,715
Rouran is a foreign land to me.

583
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:36,992
Those brothers who are always
wary of me don't see me as their kin!

584
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:42,534
If I could, I'd stay
in Great Wei forever!

585
00:36:43,193 --> 00:36:45,199
I wish to stay with those
who truly care about me.

586
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:49,822
All in all, it's still because of
that Li Wei Young!

587
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:52,880
If you truly wish the best for her

588
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,605
you should obey our Khan.

589
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:56,708
Attain "Chart of Six Elements
in Army Defense."

590
00:36:57,438 --> 00:36:58,686
Or else

591
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:03,072
it will be Li Wei Young's corpse
that awaits you.

592
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,688
Are you going against me?

593
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:09,842
I'm willing to risk my life for you.

594
00:37:12,132 --> 00:37:17,115
However, I must also carry out
our Khan's strict orders!

595
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:21,186
You can tell Li Wei Young
to be wary of us

596
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:24,626
but how long could she keep
watching out for herself?

597
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:28,702
You could also report this
to the emperor.

598
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:34,472
Give the army of Wei an excuse to
trample the meadows of Rouran

599
00:37:34,472 --> 00:37:36,367
and massacre our people!

600
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,117
Your Highness!

601
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:26,130
Master, the room is ready.

602
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,478
<i>[Snow Yard]</i>

603
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:33,099
By His Majesty's oral decree

604
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:35,820
you are to stay in this place
until the child is delivered.

605
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,565
You can enter and leave
the premises as you please.

606
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,001
But you're not to leave the palace.

607
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,932
Should you cause any trouble again

608
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:43,918
His Majesty surely wouldn't
let you off easily.

609
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,981
I hope that you can
conduct yourself well.

610
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:48,117
Thank His Majesty for his graciousness.

611
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,012
I will leave you to get some rest.

612
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:58,010
Young Mistress, what should we do now?

613
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,436
Judging by His Majesty's orders,
he won't give you any title.

614
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:04,277
The efforts you made
all these years are in vain.

615
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:10,396
Where there is a will, there is a way.

616
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:16,362
Now that I'm pregnant,
I can still slowly plan for the future.

617
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:39,889
It's already so late.
Why aren't you in bed yet?

618
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:44,833
You're already sewing clothes
for the baby now?

619
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:51,123
I might be carrying a child, but others
just see it as a bit of added flesh.

620
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:58,793
I want them, particularly
Prince of Nan-An, to see these clothes.

621
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,945
I want them to feel
the existence of this child.

622
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:03,195
Young Mistress.

623
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,179
He hasn't even visited me once.

624
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,827
Should this go on any longer,
he will forget me.

625
00:40:09,547 --> 00:40:11,043
He will also forget this child.

626
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,083
Young Mistress, don't think too much.

627
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,222
Prince of Nan-An might just
be too busy with work.

628
00:40:18,324 --> 00:40:21,382
Could he be so busy that he can't even
write a letter or send a message?

629
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,063
Rong Er, run an errand for me.

630
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:30,094
Give these clothes to
Prince of Nan-An.

631
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,148
He will know what I mean
when he sees them.

632
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:41,561
<i>[Snow Yard]</i>

633
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,030
You didn't get to see him?

634
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:02,536
I did.

635
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:03,882
What did he say?

636
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:06,068
He didn't say a word.

637
00:41:06,637 --> 00:41:08,193
He didn't say a word?

638
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:10,251
How did he react?

639
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,166
Was he happy or angry?

640
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,239
Neither.

641
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,442
He glanced at it and left.

642
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:19,550
It seems that he really
has forgotten about me.

643
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:24,807
Where is His Highness?

644
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:28,925
He isn't here?

645
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:30,371
His Highness won't be coming.

646
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,724
His Highness told me to tell Miss Li

647
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,065
to nourish the child
and give birth smoothly.

648
00:41:35,065 --> 00:41:36,409
If so, you can both be safe.

649
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,016
Should you cause any more trouble

650
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:39,817
His Highness will forego
all past sentiments.

651
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,387
He can disregard our past relationship

652
00:41:43,387 --> 00:41:45,614
but would he also ignore his own child?

653
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,380
Miss Li, you're on your own now.

654
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Hold on!

655
00:41:52,722 --> 00:41:54,117
Please tell Prince of Nan-An.

656
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:59,164
I'm carrying his flesh and blood.

657
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:03,275
If he could abandon his own child

658
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:07,717
I and his child
would never live in humiliation.

659
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:28,101
You are dismissed.

660
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:29,797
Yes, Young Mistress.

661
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:37,090
Li Wei Young?

662
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:38,487
What are you doing here?

663
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:39,873
What are you up to?

664
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:49,221
