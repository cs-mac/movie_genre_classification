1
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,724
It looks good on you.

2
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,435
But isn't it hot?

3
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,334
A little bit.

4
00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:22,364
(Episode 40)

5
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,035
You had no choice because
it's from your girlfriend.

6
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,105
Yes. Kind of.

7
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,445
You look great together.

8
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,315
My sister doesn't know.
Please don't tell her.

9
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,254
Don't worry.
I can't even if I want to.

10
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:41,124
How is she?

11
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:44,224
She only stays at home.

12
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:46,864
We broke up.

13
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:49,264
Yes.

14
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,004
I won't tell anyone
about your relationship,

15
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,374
so don't tell Young Ha...

16
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,275
that you met me here today.

17
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:02,074
She thinks I'm traveling
overseas right now.

18
00:01:02,915 --> 00:01:05,874
But if she finds out that
we met today,

19
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:12,355
I'd look ugly. Right?

20
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:15,055
You just don't want
to her to worry, do you?

21
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:19,895
Bye.

22
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,195
Here.

23
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:24,934
It's my gift.

24
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,094
No, Gwang Jae.

25
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,105
Help me keep my last pride.

26
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:31,234
Here.

27
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,374
Practice hard...

28
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,314
so that you can play good music
to her.

29
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,385
I was going to play one
for Young Ha too.

30
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:46,824
Bye for real now.
Enjoy playing the guitar.

31
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:00,534
What?

32
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,904
What is this?

33
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:05,234
I parked here just now
and they got me a ticket?

34
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,505
Gosh. How much is this?

35
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,814
That could buy me
several cup noodles.

36
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:19,654
Who is this?
I don't recognize that number.

37
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,795
- Who is this?
- Lee Gwang Jae? It's me, So Ra.

38
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,094
- So Ra?
- Yes. So Ra.

39
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:35,134
Although we were pretending,
I was still your girlfriend.

40
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,835
Oh, that So Ra.

41
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,235
Why did you call?

42
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:45,974
Long time no see.

43
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,184
Yes. Long time no see.

44
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:57,194
Things got pretty tough for me,
but it looks worse for you.

45
00:02:57,194 --> 00:02:59,624
You probably heard about me
from your ex boyfriends.

46
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,224
I did.

47
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,564
But there's a saying that
rich still lasts...

48
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,265
for 3 or 5 years even after
they're ruined.

49
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:09,434
That depends on the person.

50
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,705
I couldn't believe the rumor
you're selling everything valuable,

51
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,775
but I guess it was true.

52
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,414
Yes. You should take a look.

53
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,374
There are things you'd like.

54
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,245
Actually there's something
I have sell.

55
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:26,154
Can you sell it for me
while selling yours?

56
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:30,194
That's a new arrival.

57
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:33,224
I knew you'd recognize it at once.

58
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,265
Can you sell this for me?

59
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,564
I'll give you enough fees.

60
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:38,934
Why don't you sell it yourself?

61
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,805
I lost the guarantee card.

62
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,075
You're the guarantee card yourself.

63
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:45,534
Will you do it for me?

64
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:48,474
Are you trying to fool me
with a replica?

65
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:51,615
You'll find out right away in the
used store. Do you think I'm crazy?

66
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:54,344
Sure. I'll sell it for you.

67
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,284
There's an extra fee. 10 percent.

68
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,784
Okay. Thank you.

69
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,295
What's wrong?
Do you have a girlfriend?

70
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,594
Of course.

71
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,825
That part-timer?

72
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:11,934
She used to cause so much trouble
when you were rich,

73
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,104
but now she's your girlfriend?

74
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,504
She's rather loyal.

75
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:16,974
Aren't you leaving?

76
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,944
Tell me when it gets sold.

77
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,775
And tell her I said hi.

78
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,885
- I'm going.
- Bye.

79
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:35,724
I miss Young Ha.

80
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,924
There are so many people
who ride...

81
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:11,395
expensive foreign cars nowadays.

82
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:15,294
Maybe...

83
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:25,604
I'm here.

84
00:05:32,914 --> 00:05:34,015
Mother.

85
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:37,255
was anyone here just now?

86
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,724
Who is there to come?

87
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,025
I think I might have seen
Gwang Jae out here.

88
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,325
Gwang Jae?

89
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:48,765
It must have been a similar car.

90
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:52,065
If he happens...

91
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:54,965
to come to your house,

92
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,734
don't treat him the same way.

93
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,205
- Why not?
- They broke up.

94
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,275
It's a small village.
If strange rumors go around,

95
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:06,815
it won't be good for Young Ha.

96
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:20,965
Are you...

97
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:25,594
making Kyung Ha get married early
because of the rumors?

98
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,164
Sorry?

99
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,404
Are you hurrying this up
because she might not get...

100
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:33,775
married to a lawyer if word gets out
she dated Yong once?

101
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,474
Did you know?

102
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:41,315
You shouldn't do that
as you get older.

103
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,854
You're so obsessed with money.

104
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:47,625
Why do you look past...

105
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,224
Yong and Gwang Jae
and look at their money?

106
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:56,994
It's because my daughters' lives
depend on that.

107
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,205
All right. Let's say I understand
what you feel about Yong.

108
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:06,445
How about Gwang Jae?
You wanted Young Ha to marry him.

109
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,844
Didn't you?

110
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,414
You can't do that as a parent.

111
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,154
Even his stepmom left him.

112
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,854
He's alone in this world.

113
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:22,484
And you still want to
get rid of him.

114
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:27,294
If you care about your child,
you should care about others' too.

115
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,864
Why...

116
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:32,135
are you trying to set up
Young Ha with Gwang Jae?

117
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,705
He's poor and in debt.

118
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:39,435
Do you want Young Ha to
date someone like that?

119
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,875
She went through so much trouble
paying her debt to her dad.

120
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,484
Do you want her to start
paying off her boyfriends' debts...

121
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:48,914
now? Do you?

122
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,354
Gwang Jae is in a bad situation.

123
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:57,895
If he is, you can help him.

124
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:00,424
I heard you have a lot of money.

125
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,695
We're not going to get that money.

126
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,794
You'll give it all to Jong Yong.

127
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,604
Gosh, you're so weird.

128
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,104
Anyhow,

129
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,005
I'll take care of my daughters'
marriages myself.

130
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,914
Won Yong.

131
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,275
Oh, my.

132
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:21,344
What's this?

133
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,654
- What's going on?
- What?

134
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:28,054
It's nothing. Nothing.

135
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:29,895
What's going on?

136
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:41,104
Why is everyone making me
a villain?

137
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,134
So your love for the children
is true,

138
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,774
and mine isn't?

139
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,305
I'm sick of living...

140
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:50,945
with people who are poor.

141
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:53,114
I don't want my daughters...

142
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:57,055
- to go through the same thing!
- What did you have to go through?

143
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,285
Have I spent my money
without your consent?

144
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,925
Did I ever gamble?
Did I do anything weird?

145
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,494
You didn't go through any trouble.
I was the one who did.

146
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06,864
You didn't gamble?
You didn't do anything weird?

147
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:10,465
What... What did I do?

148
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:11,764
If you compare me to...

149
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:14,305
Yes, you did earn your salaries.

150
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:16,335
Your precious salaries.

151
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:19,675
The salary that disappears
within a week...

152
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,705
as if it were a snowman.

153
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:26,144
After we pay off the credits,
the suit fees,

154
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,685
pay off your drinks,

155
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,384
pay for your brother
and our children's tuition fees,

156
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,655
and give presents...

157
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:36,925
like dried corvinas, meats,
and fruits...

158
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,994
to the managers, directors,

159
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,894
and the chairmen.

160
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:45,364
You wanted to start
your own business,

161
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:49,604
so I borrowed money
from my friends from high school.

162
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,675
The ones who got lower scores
on the exams,

163
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,405
the ones whom I had ignored
back then.

164
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:57,114
Have you tried that?

165
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:59,045
Have you borrowed money like that?

166
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:04,285
Have you ever felt that
feeling of embarrassment...

167
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:05,685
that creeps up to your face?

168
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,884
I'm sorry. I was wrong.
I should be the one to die. Stop.

169
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,425
You didn't do anything weird?

170
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,624
You went to Wolmido Island
with Ms. Park.

171
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,835
And my cousin caught you there.
What was that?

172
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,894
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my.

173
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:23,374
Gosh.

174
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,335
Gosh, my skin is falling off.

175
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:28,474
Your skin won't get off like that.
You need to do this...

176
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,075
Gosh.

177
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:32,374
What are you doing?

178
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:36,815
Hyun Sook, you don't know this,

179
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:39,354
but there was more than Ms. Park
to him.

180
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:44,094
- Mom.
- When you were pregnant and sick,

181
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:46,364
you went to your own house
for a while.

182
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,825
Mom!

183
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:51,665
There was a chubby woman
called Ms. Yoon...

184
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,134
or Ms. Yoo then.

185
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:55,435
He took her to Dobong mountain
many times.

186
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:58,035
- Gosh, you scum!
- No, no, no!

187
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:01,474
- Gosh!
- This was a misunderstanding!

188
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:03,114
It was a misunderstanding!

189
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:05,815
I met with Ms. Yoon to get her...

190
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,815
on a date with Mr. Song.

191
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,614
That's how they got married.

192
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,655
- Gosh.
- Now that I think about it,

193
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,185
you've gone through a lot.

194
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,594
Gosh.

195
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,065
You don't mean that.

196
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,234
People don't always mean
everything they say.

197
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,705
All right. Today,

198
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:29,264
if we put ourselves on the scale,

199
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:31,575
we'd weigh about the same.

200
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:36,205
So let's just forget the past.

201
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,445
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,715
I'm no better.

203
00:11:43,384 --> 00:11:44,655
I'm sorry too.

204
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,425
You know that
teeth bites can hurt too, right?

205
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:51,594
If it gets worse,
he'll suffer in the summer.

206
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,524
Even if you hate him, put on
some medications for him,

207
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:55,994
that playboy.

208
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:58,094
Playboy?

209
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,075
Gosh, the blood...

210
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:17,754
Where's Yong?

211
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:20,024
He went to see a movie
with his date.

212
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,955
Then we don't need to go
anywhere else.

213
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:36,675
You made your brother's worth
3,000 dollars.

214
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:38,205
Are you happy now?

215
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,075
- Kyung Ha.
- Seo Hee.

216
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,075
There's something you don't know.

217
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,344
I...

218
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,055
really loved Yong.

219
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,524
What we had...

220
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,254
was a real love.

221
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:03,835
Thank you for ruining that for me.

222
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:20,859
[Kocowa Ver] MBC E40 Rich Family's Son
-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-

223
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:34,394
Don't cry.

224
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:36,935
Yong.

225
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:39,234
I swear...

226
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:43,604
I'll make them
kneel in front of you.

227
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,905
I'll make sure of that!

228
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:47,344
I...

229
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,315
really liked her.

230
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:54,185
We were just innocent then.

231
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:57,085
So...

232
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:59,155
don't do it.

233
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:02,254
Yong. Yong.

234
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,425
I'm going to pray for...

235
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:08,624
Kyung Ha's happiness.

236
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:11,764
So, Seo Hee.

237
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:14,234
Don't do that.

238
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,634
Yong.

239
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:32,614
(Yong's Equipment)

240
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,614
Kyung Ha. I'm sorry.

241
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:42,085
I think I'll have to stay up
all night for the trial tomorrow.

242
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,394
Okay. I'll see you later.

243
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,234
Why is he coming all of a sudden?

244
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:02,004
Honey. What if Lawyer Park
brings ham?

245
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:04,945
Right. Is he?

246
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:08,514
Why would he call to visit us
politely?

247
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,585
I know.

248
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,815
Lawyer Park can't come.

249
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,624
He's not prepared for the trial.

250
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:18,825
The whole team has to stay up
all night.

251
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,024
Okay.

252
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:26,035
It's about his work.
We should understand.

253
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:28,405
Why is Young Ha late?

254
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:34,805
These sales don't
match the supplies.

255
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,344
There was a reason
I was watching these stores.

256
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,884
Yes. You were right about them.

257
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,155
You were sharp to find it out.

258
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,354
Good job today until this late.

259
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,655
I'm glad I could be helpful.

260
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,994
Do you like to have dinner together
since it's late?

261
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,764
I'll have dinner at home.

262
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,134
Then how about some beer?

263
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,835
I'm going to stop drinking.

264
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,234
Okay.

265
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:07,974
Did you hear from Gwang Jae
by chance?

266
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,715
No. He's probably
wandering in the desert.

267
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,824
If he calls you,

268
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:22,024
tell him to stop wandering
and come straight to me.

269
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,595
There are things that can't
be done without him.

270
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:25,855
Some of them are urgent.

271
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,294
He probably wouldn’t call me.

272
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:32,095
Let's go now.

273
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:33,635
Okay.

274
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,484
Don't tell Young Ha that
you met Gwang Jae.

275
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,254
Why not? Isn't this when
he needs her the most?

276
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,024
I already said you don't.

277
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,435
It was so hard for her to break up
with him. Why disturb her now?

278
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:08,435
Honestly, I think it was wrong to
break up with him in that situation.

279
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:12,004
Honestly, this is cruel.

280
00:18:12,004 --> 00:18:14,175
You think it's not cruel
to hold onto her life...

281
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:17,244
in the name of love
when he has nothing?

282
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:22,715
Kim Myung Ha.
I'm telling you right now.

283
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:25,284
If you don't have what you need,
don't even think about marriage.

284
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,655
Don't worry.

285
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:31,794
I'd never date any woman like you.

286
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,734
Sure.

287
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,345
Don't date a woman like me.

288
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,115
Please.

289
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,695
You're late.

290
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,024
Are you going home?

291
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,024
Yes. I was about to go to
food stall. Do you want to join?

292
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,264
No.

293
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:18,974
(Yong's Equipment)

294
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,175
If you broke up, let it go.

295
00:19:24,115 --> 00:19:28,215
I know, but I'm worried about him.

296
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,484
Yong.

297
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,284
He really has no idea
how the world works.

298
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:35,224
That's how he gets to learn.

299
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:40,465
Young Ha. Just stick to your path.

300
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:42,395
Don't look back.

301
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,034
That will also help him.

302
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:55,945
Should I go to the food stall
with you?

303
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,645
Just go home.

304
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:00,945
Okay.

305
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:06,355
Myung Ha's here.

306
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,324
How's your Chinese friend doing?

307
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,734
Yes. Let's talk later.

308
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,465
Sure.

309
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,004
Let's go.

310
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:26,405
Bye.

311
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:36,415
What are you doing? What?

312
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,215
Sit down for a sec.

313
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:47,665
I met Gwang Jae today.

314
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:51,965
Gwang Jae? Where?

315
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:53,705
At my school.

316
00:20:54,635 --> 00:20:56,034
What was he doing there?

317
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,375
He was selling used clothes
to my friend.

318
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:03,744
What?

319
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,984
He asked me not to tell you.

320
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:09,314
He seemed struggling.

321
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:11,685
But...

322
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,185
did you really break up with him?

323
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:18,754
I know Kyung Ha would do that,

324
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,524
but I didn't know about you.

325
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:24,994
That's what Gwang Jae wanted.

326
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:26,665
You really think he meant it?

327
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,935
He meant it.

328
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:31,435
But why is he selling clothes?

329
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:33,574
He told me he was going abroad.

330
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,014
It's...

331
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:49,084
Gwang Jae's bike jacket.

332
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:52,224
There are probably things
he couldn't tell you.

333
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:53,425
You should find out.

334
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,845
I lost the guarantee card.

335
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:11,215
You're the guarantee card yourself.

336
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:12,814
Will you do it for me?

337
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:25,895
It's for quick sale.

338
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:27,925
The owner asked me to sell it quick.

339
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:30,794
2 million is a very cheap price.

340
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,665
The site itself is huge.

341
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,234
- Ma'am.
- My goodness.

342
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,935
Hello.

343
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,334
- Is this house on sale?
- I guess so.

344
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,445
My goodness, Gwang Jae.

345
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:45,375
Tell him to take
the rest of his belongings.

346
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,145
He's abroad.

347
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,945
He stopped by a few days ago.

348
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:50,415
A few days ago...

349
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:51,955
What?

350
00:22:52,655 --> 00:22:55,284
- Uncle Hyo Dong!
- Gwang Jae!

351
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,355
Gwang Jae! Gwang Jae!

352
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:01,465
- Uncle Hyo Dong!
- Gwang Jae!

353
00:23:03,695 --> 00:23:06,705
I'm so glad to see you.
How have you been?

354
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,665
I thought you went abroad.

355
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:11,774
What are you talking about?

356
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,105
Where did you stay?

357
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:16,715
- By riverside.
- My goodness.

358
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:19,175
The house is on the market?

359
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:20,984
My house?

360
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:23,054
It's for quick sale.

361
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:27,054
It looks like they're going to sell
everything and take off.

362
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,465
Gwang Jae.

363
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,564
Actually...

364
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:39,804
there's something I have confess.

365
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:45,504
I...

366
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:50,615
was deceived by CEO Nam.

367
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:58,655
I deserve to die.

368
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,284
I deserve to die.

369
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:03,395
What are you talking about?
Be clear.

370
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:05,095
Stop crying.

371
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:08,595
I was deceived. I was deceived.

372
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,895
I was deceived twice.

373
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:14,064
At first, I didn't know
that he fooled me.

374
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:16,165
And the second time,
I had no choice.

375
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,945
I was deceived by CEO Nam twice.

376
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:24,115
I'm such an idiot.

377
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,814
I made Gye Dong die.

378
00:24:33,484 --> 00:24:36,754
I'm sorry, Gwang Jae. I'm sorry.

379
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,895
Because of gambling debts,

380
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:43,435
I ended up laying my hands on
the company fund.

381
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,064
What?

382
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,705
I needed money as the debt grew.

383
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:54,105
CEO Nam and Tae Il knew
and put a bait.

384
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:58,314
I handed over
Gye Dong's recipe book...

385
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,415
to private moneylenders
instead of money.

386
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:07,024
I thought I'd get it back soon.

387
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:12,355
Then the recipe plagiarism incident
broke out.

388
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:17,135
The recipe book in the main office
disappeared too.

389
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:22,605
Actually the manager said
CEO Nam did something...

390
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:24,474
suspicious in the kitchen that day.

391
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,004
I think CEO Nam and Tae Il are...

392
00:25:28,244 --> 00:25:29,845
behind this.

393
00:25:30,814 --> 00:25:33,484
I'm certain,
but there's no evidence.

394
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:37,385
That's not all, Gwang Jae.

395
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,355
Hello?

396
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:15,685
It's me, Lee Gwang Jae.

397
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,324
The man dating Young Ha
in the night market.

398
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:23,965
The jerk one.

399
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:27,334
Oh, Gwang Jae. Yes.

400
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:30,705
Can you meet me for a second?

401
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,274
Come up.

402
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:46,925
Long time no see.

403
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,794
Yes. Long time no see.

404
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:56,024
You look different than before.

405
00:26:57,764 --> 00:26:59,494
I'm still the same guy inside.

406
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,405
- Would you like some tea?
- No thanks.

407
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,234
I brought my own.

408
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:14,115
I'm here to ask you
for legal advice.

409
00:27:15,145 --> 00:27:17,554
I'll give you this
instead of the fee.

410
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:24,955
What is it?

411
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:30,135
I want to get back my dad's fortune
that is stolen by a fake divorce.

412
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:34,935
It's a house and one store.

413
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:38,004
The current value is
about 5 million dollars.

414
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:39,645
I want to get them back,

415
00:27:41,504 --> 00:27:43,215
and pay off my dad's debt.

416
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,355
My heart is about to burst
due to resentment.

417
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:52,984
I'm going to...

418
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,385
get my house back.

419
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,824
I'm going to get all that back.

420
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:00,294
I'm not trying to keep it.

421
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:06,504
I want to get it back,
so that I can pay off...

422
00:28:06,504 --> 00:28:08,004
to those who suffered
because of my dad.

423
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:13,274
Please help me.

424
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:01,324
(The Rich Son)

425
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,125
We're not family anymore.
You're not my brother anymore.

426
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,395
Don't be a coward, Director Nam!

427
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:08,595
Don't make me go down to the bottom.
I'm not a saint.

428
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:10,994
Even at this moment, I want to
ruin your marriage.

429
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:13,135
I'll get straight down to it.
Do you love Kyung Ha?

430
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:15,635
What are you going to do for me
if I help Gwang Jae?

431
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:16,804
Then this is a replica.

432
00:29:16,804 --> 00:29:18,804
- You have to come with me.
- Why?

433
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:20,744
Hey, you thieves!

434
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:22,875
You robbers!

435
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:26,415
I told him to go to his mom,
Nam Soo Hee...

436
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,715
who doesn't take responsibility
after giving birth.
