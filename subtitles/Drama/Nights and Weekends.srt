1
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,578
You wanna just get a
bunch of shit and share it?

2
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,276
Yeah, like, let's eat
on the ground like animals.

3
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,285
O.K., great.

4
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,420
I made both of
your towels wet. Sorry.

5
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,656
That's O.K.

6
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:11,895
Mmm...

7
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,101
One second.
I'm almost ready.

8
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:23,949
What's up, my man?

9
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,645
Feels good to have you here.

10
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,983
I know.
It feels good to be here.

11
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,660
You O.K.?

12
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:39,494
Yeah?

13
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,091
You hungry?

14
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:43,102
We're gonna get food.

15
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:47,471
O.K.

16
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,475
What?
You have sad face still.

17
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:54,036
What's your sad face about?

18
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,172
That's not happy face.

19
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:58,184
That's artificial happy face.

20
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,186
I'll be right back.
One second.

21
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,447
So who's your new
lab partner?

22
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,616
Well, they haven't assigned...

23
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:07,058
...them yet because...

24
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,152
There was, like,
the number of people...

25
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,856
...in the class didn't match up...

26
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,331
...and everybody else was happy
with their lab partners.

27
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,492
But the good thing is...

28
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,469
...number one: she didn't have to know
that I complained about her...

29
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:20,234
...and number two...

30
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:21,865
What are you doing?

31
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:23,000
Number two?

32
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,170
- What are you doing?
- Number two?

33
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,270
Are you taking off my stuff?

34
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:29,282
Number two?

35
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:35,220
Number two is that I get...

36
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,688
...to do it all myself...

37
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,351
...which is all I wanted to do
in the beginning anyway.

38
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,791
You're your own lab partner?

39
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,419
- Mm-hmm.
- That's so sad.

40
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:43,827
No, that's awesome.

41
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:44,989
No, that's lonely.

42
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:47,397
No, everybody else
screws up my work.

43
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:49,299
Can I come be your lab partner?

44
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:51,167
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,694
- Really?
- No.

46
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,969
They wouldn't let me
into nursing school?

47
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,944
No, they'd let you in
if you applied and were...

48
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,948
You know, had a...
burning desire.

49
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,750
Button me back up, please.

50
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,185
Mm-mm.

51
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,189
- No?
- Mm-mm.

52
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:13,520
Thank you.

53
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,850
What time is it?

54
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,091
Arms up.

55
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:49,190
You were thwarted
by the inner bra.

56
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,890
Oh, shit.

57
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,324
So that's how these things work?

58
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:56,960
What?

59
00:05:57,003 --> 00:06:00,029
Yeah, that's what they do.

60
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:04,100
You girls with your multiple
layers and stitching.

61
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:06,271
That shirt cost $80, didn't it?

62
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:09,110
No, not that one, but I do
have a running shirt...

63
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,776
...that cost a lot of money.

64
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,012
It's for special running.

65
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:15,180
I was... need that.

66
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:17,451
It's for special snow running.

67
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,721
Oh...

68
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,751
- Go take a shower.
- I'm sorry.

69
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,526
So that we can start...

70
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,090
- Our day.
- Our day.

71
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:31,160
Are you gonna make me
breakfast or should we get some?

72
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,168
Well...

73
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,537
You're eating already.

74
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,008
I'm about to spoil
my breakfast, but...

75
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,704
Yeah, you are.

76
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:39,677
I'm hungry.

77
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,806
Um... O.K., well...

78
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:43,008
I'm gonna take a shower.

79
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,279
Don't spoil your breakfast too
much 'cause I haven't eaten yet...

80
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,047
...and I want to eat with you.

81
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:49,055
O.K.?

82
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:15,544
Are you sure you don't
want to take a shower with me?

83
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,074
Hold on.

84
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:21,281
Hold on what?

85
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,754
Do you wanna take one?

86
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:31,025
I mean, are you asking
me to take a shower with you...

87
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:32,395
'cause I want to get clean...

88
00:07:32,432 --> 00:07:34,491
...or because you want to
take a shower with me?

89
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:37,002
Because it'd be nice taking
a shower together.

90
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,025
Well, then, totally.

91
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,301
I just was saying that I didn't
need a shower.

92
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,932
Don't eat the brown part.

93
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,465
Eww!

94
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:51,106
I think that one of the grossest
things in the world...

95
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,711
...is somebody else eating a banana.

96
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:57,154
It's the way it smells
and it sounds.

97
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,159
And I love you, but it's gross.

98
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:03,259
Eww! Oh, God!

99
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,264
I just saw it inside your mouth.

100
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,792
You still want to take
a shower with me?

101
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,861
Yeah, I still want to
take a shower with you.

102
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,396
Just get the smell
of banana off you.

103
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,408
I like bananas when / eat-

104
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:19,941
You're just gargling banana.

105
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,117
Can I please throw this away?

106
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,427
No, don't take it off with a chip.

107
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:39,931
That's gross.

108
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,767
I don't want
to meet people.

109
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:54,072
I feel like it's gonna take a
long time and I'm not gonna know...

110
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,047
...what to say to them...

111
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,313
Because they're all video gamers...

112
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,979
And I'm not.

113
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:05,216
I know, but you're not
some antisocial freak...

114
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,988
...who can't meet people
and say "hi" to strangers.

115
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:09,153
But I don't really...

116
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:12,858
These are my...
friends and my people that I work with.

117
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,594
I know.
I want to meet them.

118
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,626
I just don't want to meet them... today.

119
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,036
But when are we...
O.K.

120
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,769
We're not gonna come back.

121
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,607
I'd rather meet them
in a social situation.

122
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:26,475
What social-

123
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,571
I don't meet them
in a social situation.

124
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,776
I don't know them outside
of this space.

125
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,786
But you said you might have,
like, um...

126
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,981
A work gathering at some point.

127
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,046
Probably not.

128
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,114
Why not?

129
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:40,751
Not that you're gonna be at.

130
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:43,125
Well, I don't know.
I just feel weird.

131
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,561
O.K.

132
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,993
Well, then let me go...

133
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,628
...so we can get out of here
as soon as possible.

134
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,638
- Go.
- O.K.

135
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,167
Let's roll.

136
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,143
Are you done?

137
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,146
I am done.

138
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,996
That took a while.

139
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,163
I'm just saying...

140
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:30,175
It didn't seem like you were
just dropping something off.

141
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,274
O.K., I'm sorry.

142
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,943
Well, were you?

143
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,188
Were you just dropping
something off?

144
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:55,330
I don't know how to answer
that question.

145
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:58,769
Was I lying to you
or was that all that I did?

146
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,774
My brother called,
so I talked to him for a second.

147
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:02,740
What did he say?

148
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,766
So that wasn't just
"dropping something off," I guess.

149
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:06,108
Is that what you're asking, though?

150
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,136
Or are you asking
was I lying to you...

151
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:09,910
...and I didn't just have
something to drop off?

152
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,110
Don't attack me.
I wasn't the one who lied.

153
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,551
Well, what the fuck's with
the tone and the attitude?

154
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,782
Well, you said
you had to drop something off...

155
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,552
...and then you're in there
for like-

156
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,058
"That took a while. "

157
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,651
Well, it did!
It took 10 minutes.

158
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:23,321
You said you had to
drop something off.

159
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,127
It's been 10 minutes
since you went in there.

160
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,968
I don't even care.
Let's just go.

161
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,971
It looks like it's...
clearing up.

162
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:34,166
Well, it doesn't matter.
We're not in any kind of rush...

163
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,903
...because we're not gonna have
dinner with my brother tonight.

164
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,570
Why?

165
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,478
Because they have a fucking
baby and because he called...

166
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,607
...and he said that they can't
have dinner tonight...

167
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:45,116
...so we got moved
to tomorrow night.

168
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:46,482
I didn't know that.

169
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,146
Don't get upset. I didn't know that.

170
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:50,849
O.K., but I feel like
you've been fucking pissy...

171
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,720
...about this whole thing.

172
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:54,625
I'm sorry that I had to
come by here today.

173
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,958
I thought buying you lunch
was like...

174
00:11:56,996 --> 00:11:58,793
I don't care if you
buy me lunch.

175
00:11:58,831 --> 00:11:59,525
I just didn't...

176
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:02,796
Like, I can't believe you didn't
deal with this yesterday.

177
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:03,597
That's it.

178
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,570
I came to get you
from the airport.

179
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,266
I couldn't stay late yesterday.

180
00:12:07,306 --> 00:12:08,967
Yeah, or anytime
earlier this week.

181
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,305
I don't wanna fight about it.

182
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,810
Let's just go.

183
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,876
Did you do any other work here?

184
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,441
Are you still fucking
asking this?

185
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:21,453
I'm not...
O.K., never mind.

186
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,588
It makes me dizzy.

187
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,600
Come do it with me.

188
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:40,299
I like that.

189
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,708
Just be fun for a second.

190
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,977
Put down the umbrella
and be fun with me.

191
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,983
Well, you put it down,
but you're not being fun with me.

192
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,188
I don't respond
to sarcastic fun!

193
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,352
Stop!

194
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:03,157
I don't respond
to sarcastic fun!

195
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:07,064
It's not funny when it's not
meant with sincerity!

196
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,397
You didn't mean that sincerely!

197
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,733
I don't want to do it if you're
just doing it out of anger-

198
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,636
I only want to do it if you're
actually gonna have fun...

199
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:16,039
...and right now you're just
fucking making fun of me...

200
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,440
...and I don't think that's funny!

201
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,510
Too hard!

202
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,040
You touched me hard!

203
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,882
That wasn't gentle!

204
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,157
It's 'cause I'm sick of you
fucking crying...

205
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,823
...every time it's not perfect.

206
00:13:38,865 --> 00:13:41,129
I don't cry every time
it's not perfect!

207
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,034
Every time that it's not
perfect, / fix it!

208
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:51,633
Every time that it's not perfect
and we haven't seen each other...

209
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:54,305
...for three months, / make sure
that / save my money...

210
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:57,407
...and buy a ticket and / make
sure that I get my work done...

211
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,883
...so we spend time together.

212
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,819
Every time it's not perfect,
/ fix it!

213
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,220
Once in a while, I cry.

214
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,190
Don't worry.

215
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:09,387
I won't cry the rest
of the weekend.

216
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,827
Don't worry.
This will never happen again.

217
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,763
You'll never have to see me cry.

218
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:15,164
Don't worry.
It's not gonna be a problem.

219
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,259
I won't cry.

220
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,860
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:25,610
Sorry.

222
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:31,743
I'm not mad at you.
I'm sorry too.

223
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,612
I just want to go home.
Let's go.

224
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,554
But not like that.

225
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:37,920
I just want to go home.

226
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,925
I don't care.

227
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:43,561
I'm not sure
she recognizes us at all yet.

228
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:44,893
Actually, I kind of, like...

229
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,593
...don't want her to be like the
kind of girl that likes, like...

230
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,328
...a beard guy... You know?

231
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,767
It's, like, kind of weird.

232
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,065
You're training her?

233
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,664
Yeah, she'll be, like,
listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd.

234
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,074
How conscious are you guys...
are you of that at all times?

235
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,634
Of the beard thing?

236
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,274
No, of messing up Little Baby Alice
for the rest of her life.

237
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,341
I'm sure we've
messed up Baby Alice already.

238
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:06,646
But do you think about it?

239
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,551
I mean, do you
lose sleep at night?

240
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,419
The thing that I worry about
is I think...

241
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:14,950
...about, um, whether she's getting
smarter all the time.

242
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,655
"Am I doing the right thing?"

243
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,061
"Am I playing
the right music?"

244
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,325
Yeah, absolutely,
all the time.

245
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:22,027
And, like, I'll put her down to
do something, and I'll be like...

246
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:23,296
"That's, that's just lame.

247
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:25,065
I'm just leaving her there...

248
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,163
...to stare at nothing
so that I can... "

249
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,367
And her brain's not growing...

250
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,433
...and she's not gonna
go to Harvard.

251
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,138
It's gonna be my fault.

252
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,703
You think she wants it?

253
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,715
I don't know,
I think she's chilling.

254
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,185
No, she wants it.

255
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:44,184
Bleh-bleh-bleh...

256
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:46,691
O.K...

257
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,216
Here you go.

258
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:50,593
Oop...

259
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,654
I got it.

260
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,366
- Can you fill this up?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:56,663
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

262
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:57,464
You O.K.?

263
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,471
O.K., all right.

264
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:03,970
Should I come and sit?

265
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,739
Yeah, come on over!

266
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:07,713
Did she get you?

267
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:08,714
No...

268
00:16:08,748 --> 00:16:11,216
She's not taking to me.

269
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,717
You want to hold her?

270
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:14,720
Yeah, sure.

271
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:15,721
Is that O.K.?

272
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:16,847
Yeah.

273
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,652
You just want to watch that.

274
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,488
You're probably gonna
have to put the pacifier in...

275
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,788
...like, right away.

276
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:23,922
Here you go.

277
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,590
Yeah.

278
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:28,563
It's O.K.

279
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,932
It's O.K. That's Mattie.

280
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,270
No, it's O.K.

281
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:39,401
You O.K.?

282
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:40,912
She just...
She just gets fussy...

283
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:41,935
...in the evenings.

284
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:42,948
Oh, no...

285
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,918
"No... No... "

286
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:51,015
No? You're not sure?

287
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,217
You're not sure.

288
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,282
That's O.K...

289
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,725
Oh, God.

290
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,057
Don't take it personally.

291
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,663
Madge?

292
00:16:58,698 --> 00:16:59,995
Yeah?

293
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,835
What is it?
What are you doing?

294
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,771
Does this seem
like something you would want?

295
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,832
A plastic lion?

296
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,173
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

297
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,940
Good.

298
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,413
Are you gonna...
acquire one for me?

299
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:20,582
I'm going to try.

300
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,689
Whoa, thanks.

301
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,514
I've never seen
one of these things.

302
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,551
We will see if the change
from the hats and gloves...

303
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:32,723
...is enough to cover
the plastic lion.

304
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:33,561
These are awful.

305
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,191
I'm just gonna start
putting money in.

306
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,599
You have awful taste.

307
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:49,481
I think it's just gonna start as soon
as I get enough money in there.

308
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,417
Oh, yeah.

309
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:56,978
Oh, my God.

310
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,819
Here goes.

311
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:20,568
This is so much machine
for a plastic lion.

312
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,646
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

313
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:25,172
O.K.

314
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,181
Good, the lion pressure's at 40.

315
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,387
Yes.

316
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,694
Go get it.

317
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,227
Is it O.K. to get it?

318
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,533
Yeah, it's O.K. to get it.

319
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:55,279
Ta-da!

320
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:57,680
And that's how babies
are made.

321
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:01,448
Whoa... This is awesome.

322
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,258
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

323
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,661
Have you named him yet?

324
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,890
Um... This lion?

325
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:12,590
Yeah.

326
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,428
No, what should I name him?

327
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,059
I don't know.

328
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:16,658
This lion.

329
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:17,430
<i>Thank you.</i>

330
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,494
<i>Let's begin.</i>

331
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,698
<i>Your session is timed,
but don't worry-</i>

332
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,902
<i>...you'/ have p/enty of time to
get your picture just right.</i>

333
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>There are severa/ categories...</i>

334
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,735
<i>...of exciting backgrounds
to choose from.</i>

335
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,747
Oh, my God, there's...

336
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:29,713
<i>Use the se/ect button...</i>

337
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,113
<i>...to view the background choices.</i>

338
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,084
O.K., choice one:
color or black and white?

339
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,346
- Um, color.
- Color, yeah.

340
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,786
Because we want to see
that the lion is yellow.

341
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,948
O.K.

342
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,582
We should do
"naughty but nice. "

343
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,354
O.K. Press "O.K."

344
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,428
<i>Now you are ready to pose
for four sittings.</i>

345
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:48,922
<i>Sit back and position yourse/f
in the picture...</i>

346
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,959
<i>...by pressing the up and down buttons.</i>

347
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,972
<i>Look between the ye/ow arrows
beneath the screen.</i>

348
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,974
<i>Ho/d sti/ and smi/e.</i>

349
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,300
This is so loud.

350
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:00,835
You got to get him
up in the circle.

351
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,074
Oh, it's not gonna show-

352
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,082
Place your face in the oval.

353
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:10,611
<i>5-4-3-2-1...</i>

354
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,087
O.K, three more settings.

355
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:18,096
<i>You can now pose
for your next sitting.</i>

356
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,330
O.K., so, but...

357
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,857
Oh, God, it's going.

358
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:24,426
It's happening.

359
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,960
Make an excited face.

360
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,306
I was in high school before
I had ever had a girlfriend...

361
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:35,745
...and when everybody else was...

362
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:40,844
...having relationships and
dating people and I had...

363
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,286
...these impossibly high standards.

364
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:47,088
I never was in any
relationships and I never...

365
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:49,356
For girls, you had
impossibly high standards?

366
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:53,024
Well, I think for all people,
but especially for girls.

367
00:20:53,766 --> 00:21:02,003
And... I had all this, like,
these lists of things that...

368
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:08,105
...were important to me that a girl
would have to meet, you know?

369
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,842
What was the list?

370
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,679
Well, I...

371
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,343
I don't know.

372
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,616
I don't remember all of it,
but one, certainly...

373
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:17,883
Can you give key examples?

374
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,391
Yeah, that's what
I was gonna tell you...

375
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:24,055
...is that one of the things on
the list was that she would...

376
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,361
...have to be somebody
who I could...

377
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,526
...leave in a room full
of my friends and...

378
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:31,399
...like, go off somewhere
and not be afraid...

379
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:34,600
...that she couldn't handle herself.

380
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,040
And I really like that about you...

381
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,805
...that I never worry...

382
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:43,042
...that I can always trust
that when I go anywhere...

383
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,549
...no matter who's around...

384
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,949
...you're gonna be cool
and everybody's gonna like you...

385
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:49,386
...and you're gonna impress everybody.

386
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,389
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

387
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:01,388
Good night, baby.

388
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,060
Good night.

389
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,210
I don't want to go tomorrow.

390
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:19,046
I don't want you to go.

391
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:25,146
This situation is...

392
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,784
...not sustainable.

393
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,160
We gotta figure out
what we're gonna do...

394
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:43,174
'cause I don't want to be
in a different city.

395
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,375
Yeah.

396
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,258
That's no plan, though.

397
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,330
We'll make a plan.

398
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,258
You promise?

399
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,893
Yeah.

400
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,631
O.K.

401
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,901
- Yeah.
- O.K.

402
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:21,769
I feel like I'm walking
into something.

403
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,866
Step over.

404
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:25,433
You got all kinds of wires.

405
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,468
We just moved in.

406
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,344
Come on, this way.

407
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:30,541
O.K.

408
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,379
And stay put for one second...

409
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:35,875
...and I'm gonna go close the door
so nobody gets in.

410
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:38,747
You O.K.?

411
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,418
Yeah.

412
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,358
All right.

413
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,384
Turn to your right...

414
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:45,259
O.K.

415
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,355
And keep walking, oh...

416
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:47,194
Keep walking.

417
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,164
O.K., thanks.

418
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,997
And...

419
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:55,770
God, um, put down the suitcase.

420
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,399
O.K.

421
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,534
And... open your eyes.

422
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,615
So I'm usually right there
when I'm talking to you.

423
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,277
Yeah.

424
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:11,713
So my sister and I were
gonna have dinner tonight.

425
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,247
Uh-huh.

426
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,259
You wanna come?

427
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:14,987
Yeah.

428
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,051
Really?

429
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,391
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

430
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:17,895
Of course.

431
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,261
She does know... stuff.

432
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,027
- You told her?
- Yeah.

433
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:22,260
So... after we talked.

434
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:24,030
Yeah.

435
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,696
Whatever.

436
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:28,971
I got you a Christmas present.

437
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:30,599
You got me
a Christmas present?

438
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:31,768
- Yeah.
- What'd you get me?

439
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,675
I'm gonna make you guess.

440
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,571
I already have a tree.

441
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:37,843
You want clues?

442
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:38,542
Um...

443
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,915
O.K., clue number one...

444
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:40,816
O.K.

445
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:43,617
It is something...

446
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,486
...that you can use.

447
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:46,752
It's functional.

448
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:47,281
Um, and...

449
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:49,351
Wait, should you ask
questions and I say yes or no...

450
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:50,258
...or should I-

451
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,456
- Yeah, I'll ask questions.
- O.K.

452
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:56,194
Um, is it...

453
00:25:56,235 --> 00:26:00,103
Is it...
Is it biodegradable?

454
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,127
Yes.

455
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:01,867
It is?

456
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,306
I'm pretty sure.

457
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:04,809
My answer is "eventually. "

458
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:06,902
But isn't everything?

459
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,379
Are there some things
that are eventually not?

460
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:15,046
It's half quickly biodegradable,
half I-have-no-idea biodegradable.

461
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:17,715
O.K., um, is it...

462
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,391
Is it romantic?

463
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:22,893
No.

464
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,658
Is it...

465
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,330
Don't look over here.

466
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:31,734
O.K.

467
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:35,904
I'm buying it because I love you
and because I know that you need it...

468
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:40,503
...and because it's something
that you're doing...

469
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:44,174
...and it's two of it and it's...

470
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:48,785
New running shoes!

471
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,117
You got me running shoes!

472
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,123
Oh, my God, that's awesome!

473
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,591
Oh, thank you so much!

474
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,184
You're welcome.
Do you like 'em?

475
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,991
Yeah, I love 'em.

476
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,621
Really?

477
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,132
Oh, these are perfect.
Yeah, I love these colors too.

478
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:03,191
When you were in Chicago,
I checked your shoe size.

479
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:04,634
Ah, this is perfect.

480
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,661
Yeah, this guy is not
gonna last.

481
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:08,104
I know. They're busted.

482
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,107
This is awesome.

483
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:11,336
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

484
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,741
This is so great.

485
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:14,473
Where's the other one?

486
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:15,241
Right here.

487
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,111
Sorry that they're
not wrapped.

488
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:19,379
They're awesome.
They look so retro and cool.

489
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:20,885
Yeah?

490
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,511
- I like it.
- Good.

491
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,146
You did good.

492
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,214
You chose well for a guy.

493
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:26,815
Oh, good.

494
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,122
I mean, for anybody,
but especially for a guy.

495
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,253
Yeah.

496
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:31,557
I like them a lot.

497
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,188
I couldn't sleep last night...

498
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:35,597
...so I went shoe shopping.

499
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,428
That's something to do.

500
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,367
I love 'em.

501
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:43,465
Merry Christmas.

502
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:45,100
Merry early Christmas.

503
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,111
Sorry I couldn't wait
till christmas.

504
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,825
How are you?

505
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,461
Um... I'm a little...

506
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,169
I'm a little nervous right now.

507
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:23,238
What about you?
Yeah?

508
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

509
00:29:19,438 --> 00:29:22,407
Did you see my
Lapis Lazuli bracelet?

510
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,172
It's for honesty.

511
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:27,745
Really?

512
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,738
Yep...
Personal honesty with myself.

513
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,496
- You know what?
- What?

514
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:52,127
It's gonna be good.

515
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,831
Like, whatever happens, it's gonna be good.

516
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:57,273
Yeah, 'cause I know I'm gonna
look like you in 10 years.

517
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,139
Hell, yeah!

518
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:04,644
Right?

519
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:06,583
Oh...

520
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,176
You're a babe.

521
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,484
I feel like...
you got legs for days.

522
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,656
Shut up.

523
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:15,956
I still wanna get
my hair re-dyed.

524
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,985
You do?
Oh, no, not yet.

525
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,553
Little longer, a little longer.

526
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:20,724
I really like it.

527
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:22,995
I wanna go to your place
and go to your woman.

528
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:25,161
Yeah, Kelly.
She's awesome...

529
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,568
Shit, here they come.

530
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:28,038
Here they come.

531
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:30,041
Gotta put the hat back on.

532
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,566
Thank God.

533
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,237
You guys ready to go?

534
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:35,109
Yeah, but first you have
to get us warm.

535
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:37,115
You ladies have boyfriends?

536
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,776
We can't move.

537
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,341
I know.

538
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:41,477
You stiff?

539
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,748
Yeah, in the butt.

540
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,482
- In the butt?
- In the butt.

541
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,991
There were times when
I did feel pretty and I knew...

542
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:53,157
...but, like...
I derived this weird thing-

543
00:30:53,198 --> 00:30:55,428
I don't know if
I felt it most in college...

544
00:30:55,467 --> 00:31:00,564
I think I felt it most in
college, but, like, um...

545
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,403
...that feeling of, like,
I'm pretty and maybe that will...

546
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,772
...make people talk to me...

547
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:05,537
Mm-hmm.

548
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:07,841
But I was, I always had
this feeling of, like...

549
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:12,179
"you have no fucking idea, like...

550
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:15,277
...that I'm what you got coming,"

551
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,787
...which sounds really...

552
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:19,881
...which was really arrogant...

553
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,017
...but I was like-

554
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:21,991
I don't know-

555
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:25,019
Like, you may talk to me
because I'm pretty...

556
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:26,724
...but when you start talking to me...

557
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,630
...you're gonna get...

558
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,101
I'm gonna be one of the smartest...

559
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,604
...coolest people you've ever met.

560
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,336
I don't know...

561
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:43,678
That sounds really arrogant,
but, um, I don't know.

562
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,184
I think that I've always had
a mental image of myself...

563
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,991
...that's not necessarily associated
with the way I actually look.

564
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:59,553
I know what you mean.

565
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,329
Like I forget myself.

566
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:04,960
Right.

567
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,664
I forget my actual face...

568
00:32:06,705 --> 00:32:10,436
...and I think in my head I project
some kind of confident...

569
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:14,605
...handsome face, and then occasionally
I'll see myself and go...

570
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:17,410
"Oh, my God.
This is what you look like?

571
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,609
That's pathetic. "

572
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,245
But then I don't need to worry
about it because I have a mental...

573
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:26,155
...handsome projection that gives me
confidence in the world.

574
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,488
You know?

575
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:28,389
Yeah.

576
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:30,826
And it allows me to forget.

577
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:34,059
I realized once that my mom
and I make... the same face...

578
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,260
...when we're disgusted
by something.

579
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:37,962
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:41,495
That's funny 'cause one time
I realized that I make the same face...

581
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,838
...as my dad
when I'm driving and I'm, like...

582
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,741
...concentrating or looking at something.

583
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,109
What's the face?

584
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:52,105
I... I'm trying to remember
what the face is.

585
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,448
It's like...
I don't know, I don't know.

586
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:57,546
I just felt myself
do it one time.

587
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,580
And I could just feel
that it was my dad's face.

588
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:01,216
I didn't have to look at it.

589
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:05,218
Or it was my impression
of my dad's face.

590
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,363
Do you know that you make
the same face as your mom?

591
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:14,895
Or do you just feel-

592
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,531
I just feel like
it's the same face.

593
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,735
You feel like you're using
the same muscles and-

594
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:22,679
I know we do similar things
when we put on makeup too.

595
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:24,204
What things?

596
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:26,217
Like similar faces.

597
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:30,117
If you turned out like your dad,
would you be happy?

598
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:31,622
Yes.

599
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:37,417
I hope all the time that
I'm turning out like my dad.

600
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,826
I think he's a great man.

601
00:33:47,205 --> 00:33:49,765
That's really nice.

602
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,515
I have a totally unrelated question.

603
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,882
Did you say that you loved me
because you thought that...

604
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,717
...that's what I wanted to hear at
the time, or it was exciting?

605
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,279
Or did you feel it?

606
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:08,019
The first time that I said
"I love you" to you?

607
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,686
No, I felt it.

608
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:11,722
I waited to say it.

609
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,196
I didn't do this with you...

610
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:15,199
...but I have said it
because I've been excited.

611
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:23,303
I would rather alienate
somebody than say...

612
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,071
"I love you" and not mean it.

613
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:31,413
'Cause I think you gotta be
kind of precious with things like that.

614
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,907
I, unfortunately, have not been
as precious as I should be.

615
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:46,891
I'm probably guilty of
being overly precious.

616
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:20,924
Here, I'm gonna fall
and give you my weight.

617
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:22,933
Wait, no, no, no.
You gotta get ready.

618
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,026
I'm really gonna go dead on you.

619
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:27,299
Like...

620
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:33,009
No, I want you to,
like, lift me up.

621
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:33,806
Hold you up?

622
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:35,540
Yeah, like, I'm gonna
go dead on you...

623
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,571
...and I want you
to be able to hold me.

624
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,242
O.K.

625
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,087
A very small person can lift
up a very heavy person...

626
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,320
...because they balance them correctly...

627
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,093
And you kind of use that theory
with your own body...

628
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,430
...and then you apply it
to your partner.

629
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:58,333
It's really...
You know...

630
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:01,133
I just thought that, like...

631
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:06,576
...if I don't end up being pregnant
and we don't get together...

632
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:09,739
...like, you could just be...

633
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:17,243
I could just be...
in your life, like...

634
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:23,150
This story of this girl
that you maybe once...

635
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:25,219
...were gonna have a baby with.

636
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:32,861
Maybe you wouldn't
even mention that.

637
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:50,879
Do you ever wonder how, like...

638
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:54,380
...like, what story you're gonna be
in somebody else's life?

639
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,661
You ever think about that?

640
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:01,756
You know what I mean?

641
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:05,291
Like, what's gonna be your
soundbite for the next person?

642
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,520
Hey, baby, it's me.

643
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:42,124
Um, I'm in Manhattan now, so I
was just calling to let you know...

644
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,464
...that I got here safely and that...

645
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:48,768
...um, you should call me back now.

646
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:52,242
Um, call me back within
the next hour if you get this.

647
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:55,211
Otherwise I'll probably be
doing my interview...

648
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:58,147
...and if that's the case,
I will just call you back...

649
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,707
...as soon as
I'm done with that.

650
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,310
O.K., um, I love you.

651
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,117
I hope you're doing good
and I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

652
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:52,969
Hello?

653
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:57,304
Uh... hi.

654
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,746
James?

655
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:05,275
I was wondering if, um...

656
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:08,877
...part of the appeal of these
games is that, sort of...

657
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,253
...modern life as we know it is so...

658
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,157
...sort of, mundane and dry...

659
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:16,820
...and we never
really find ourselves...

660
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,261
...in any life-or-death situations, really.

661
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:20,662
We tend to be driving cars...

662
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,223
...or shopping in malls
or sitting at desks...

663
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:25,997
...with computers and...

664
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:28,301
And so that maybe
these games, you know...

665
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,567
...fulfill some kind of...

666
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:35,170
...intense excitement
or somehow make us feel alive...

667
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,545
...whereas in our
day-to-day existence we never...

668
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:40,915
Don't really have those
sensations of intensity and...

669
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:42,715
...life or death.

670
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,416
I don't know if you experience it
in the same way, though.

671
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,014
Like, you know, um...

672
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:50,221
The intensity of shooting
someone in the game is not...

673
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:53,788
I mean, you know, I wouldn't
even think that it comes close...

674
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:56,527
...to what it must be like
to actually shoot a gun.

675
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,933
Like, I've never shot a real gun
in my life, you know?

676
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,767
I've only shot a video game gun.

677
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:05,467
I'm sorry...
I can get that later.

678
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,673
Um... So...

679
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:11,773
Yeah, I don't know.
I think that that's part of it...

680
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:17,379
...but I think that it's...
there's something... more.

681
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,584
What were you writing?
I noticed you were taking notes.

682
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,718
Oh, um, I was-

683
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,252
Are you publishing a secret
interview for some other publication?

684
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:27,389
No, no, no.

685
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:29,797
I'm not.
I was just sort of...

686
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:33,668
...writing little notes about
what you said or...

687
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:35,831
It's sort of embarrassing.

688
00:41:36,808 --> 00:41:38,105
...it was mostly just, like, me saying...

689
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:40,804
"Oh, I didn't know all this stuff.
I didn't... "

690
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:43,313
And it seemed like, all right...

691
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:44,439
You were writing that down?

692
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:48,009
Well, I was, like,
I'm finding out things or whatever, but...

693
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:50,350
Um, do you want to...
You want to go somewhere?

694
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,616
I'm sorry I invited you over...

695
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,886
...and then you just had
to sit in a hotel room.

696
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,256
Oh, no, don't even
worry about it...

697
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,818
Let's go...
Let's go somewhere.

698
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:59,853
It's probably, like, not best
to just hang out here.

699
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:01,865
I know it's, um...

700
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,863
It feels like...

701
00:42:04,902 --> 00:42:07,234
- Like a hotel room.
- Like a hotel room.

702
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,068
- Yeah.
- I agree.

703
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,198
All right, um...

704
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,232
...there's a place around here...

705
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:13,834
Do you want food
or coffee or?...

706
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:14,936
- That's fine.
- Yeah?

707
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:17,504
I just want to talk
and say hey and talk to you...

708
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:19,175
...so wherever's good for that.

709
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:21,014
O.K., sounds good.

710
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:24,326
Hey, Mattie. It's James.

711
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:27,769
Um, hey... I'm almost finished
with what I need to do here...

712
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:29,739
...so, um, I was calling to...

713
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,332
'cause you said that maybe...

714
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:35,402
...you would have some time tonight
to hang out or something.

715
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:39,212
So what I have to do is go
to that photo shoot later...

716
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,344
...and I don't know
what your plan is...

717
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:45,321
...but it's sort of over in your
neighborhood, so I was thinking...

718
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:49,816
...that maybe I could come
over to your place first...

719
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,327
...and we can
hang out a little bit.

720
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:53,762
And then also I was gonna say
you're welcome to come...

721
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:56,323
...to the photo shoot with me
because I was thinking that might be...

722
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:00,098
...something that would be fun
or funny or something to do.

723
00:46:00,137 --> 00:46:01,798
So anyway, call me back.

724
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,500
I'm about to go back in...

725
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,510
I have one more thing
that I have to do here...

726
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:09,308
...so if I don't pick up,
I'll just call back.

727
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:10,745
But leave a message and let me know...

728
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:13,875
...what you think so I can,
um, plan that out a little bit.

729
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:16,944
O.K., I hope you're doing good
and I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

730
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,461
Yeah, um...

731
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:03,430
So nobody's home and...

732
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:05,271
What are you trying to say?

733
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:07,800
Nothing, I'm just sort of
analyzing the space...

734
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:11,110
...to see if there's anything embarrassing,
right off the bat.

735
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:13,639
You had all day
to figure that out.

736
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:16,585
I know, but I just...
It's pressure now.

737
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:18,916
Do you want me to lock this?

738
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:20,787
No. That's good.
I think we're good.

739
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:22,485
O.K. I don't see any-

740
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,585
This room looks
different to me.

741
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:26,255
Have you lost roommates?

742
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:28,264
No, no, she's still there.

743
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,993
I just...

744
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,166
Oh, don't close the computer.

745
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:40,107
No, it's O.K.

746
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:41,577
I want to read something.

747
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:42,704
No, there's nothing-

748
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:43,644
Have you been
working all day?

749
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,307
Yes, I have, but there's nothing-

750
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:46,407
Come on.

751
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,680
No, uh...
Please, please don't.

752
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:53,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

753
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:53,988
Why?

754
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:57,152
Uh, I don't like people
to read stuff.

755
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:58,821
I don't...

756
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,324
Sorry, I'm, like,
kind of out of it.

757
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:10,830
I've been alone, writing, so...

758
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,510
You want to come with me
to this photo shoot?

759
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:17,844
Yeah, totally.

760
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:21,780
I look kind of like a...

761
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:25,516
...member of a...
'80s band.

762
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:28,684
I want to do it
like rockabilly or something.

763
00:52:28,725 --> 00:52:30,352
O.K.

764
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:34,890
Hold on.
All the electricity might blow.

765
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,135
Let me see.

766
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:15,671
Well, this is the shirt.

767
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:24,003
That's...

768
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:26,174
All right, we're getting there.

769
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:27,444
I have jeans.

770
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,247
Do you have dark jeans
like this?

771
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:30,378
Awesome.

772
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:34,090
I'm sorry. I really wish
I could show it to you...

773
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:35,716
...but I just can't...

774
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:38,887
'cause then I'd never be able to
see you the rest of the weekend.

775
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,430
You couldn't make
eye contact with me...

776
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:47,403
...if you knew that I had
read that stuff?

777
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:49,029
It's hard enough as it is.

778
00:53:49,072 --> 00:53:50,471
What does that mean?

779
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:53,874
- Nothing.
- Why'd you say that then?

780
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,141
Well...

781
00:53:56,847 --> 00:54:00,613
Anyway, um, actually, uh...

782
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:03,643
Do you want to think about
getting out of here soon?

783
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:04,551
Yeah.

784
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:11,357
No, um, I actually was
hoping that, um...

785
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:14,592
I don't know if this is,
like, weird, and I...

786
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:16,826
On the subject of writing
and like, you know...

787
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,994
...how you've read my reviews
and all that?

788
00:54:19,036 --> 00:54:21,402
And that's fine,
I'm fine with you reading that.

789
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,872
But, like, the poetry,
the short stories...

790
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:26,375
Anyway, um...
This is...

791
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,878
I don't...

792
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:30,743
I'm trying to say something...

793
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:32,248
O.K.?

794
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:33,442
I'm listening.

795
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:36,646
O.K., um, so this is, like...

796
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,450
Uh... I...

797
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,987
I don't know what, um, like...

798
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:48,122
I don't know what my next, um...

799
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:52,261
...gig is in that...
in the review section...

800
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:55,897
...and I was wondering if...

801
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:57,702
I just thought of it...

802
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:59,174
'cause, you know, we're gonna go...

803
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,699
...to the photo shoot for the thing...

804
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,507
...so I was just, like...

805
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:05,845
...thinking that if,
if you could...

806
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:10,285
Uh... If I... If you wouldn't
mind if I could have, like, um...

807
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,812
...like the, the telephone number
or, like, e-mail or whatever...

808
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:18,487
...um, of that,
of that reporter yesterday...

809
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:20,996
...because I'm doing
that kind of stuff...

810
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,056
...and that would be really great.

811
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,328
Is that weird?

812
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:26,928
That's what you just got
all worked up about?

813
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:36,903
You ready to go?

814
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,915
Yeah, totally.

815
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,011
Let's do it.

816
00:55:42,686 --> 00:55:44,153
You look good.
You're ready.

817
00:55:44,187 --> 00:55:46,621
Thanks, you look good too.

818
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:48,852
Thank you, I look just like you.

819
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,553
That's what I mean.

820
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:53,594
O.K.

821
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,839
Just give me one second...

822
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:07,200
...to do this real quick.

823
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,179
If you just go
in that other room...

824
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,682
I'll just meet you out there.

825
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:17,744
Do you mind just
closing the door for a second?

826
00:56:17,788 --> 00:56:18,812
I'm just gonna...

827
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,790
I'm just gonna, like, adjust myself,
and put on a...

828
00:56:21,825 --> 00:56:25,090
Actually I'm not
wearing a bra, but...

829
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,765
Does it matter which one?

830
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:08,134
No, I have one
in the camera now...

831
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:12,369
...so just keep that on you
in case I run out.

832
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:16,401
What do I do?

833
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:18,505
Do I smile or do I be serious?

834
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:21,176
Right now, you can do
whatever the hell you want...

835
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,913
...and then when I've
got the lighting right...

836
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:24,921
...then I'll direct you.

837
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:35,259
Can you slide the chair,
like, behind me?

838
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:37,664
I like the way that you're
directing him.

839
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:39,669
- Really?
- And so do it...

840
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,364
God, well...

841
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:45,374
Career opportunities
cropping up all the time.

842
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,672
Not this way. Right here.

843
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,203
O.K., O.K.

844
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:53,216
Perfect.
I like that one.

845
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,946
Ooh, that's good.

846
00:57:56,853 --> 00:57:59,151
Oh, that's nice.
I like that.

847
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:02,685
I think it's very you.

848
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:03,624
Yeah.

849
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,560
Try to look like you're...
Look at your girlfriend.

850
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:07,256
- What's that?
- Look at your girlfriend.

851
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:08,924
O.K.

852
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:14,433
Try not to look so goofy.
Bring your chin up a little.

853
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:16,439
Come on, help me.

854
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:19,498
Why don't you look like...

855
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:20,601
Help me look dignified.

856
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:22,737
Why don't you just look
like you just got caught.

857
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,543
Go like this.

858
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:27,413
Like, try...

859
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,180
No, and then you're scared...

860
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,916
...like that you're trying
not to make an expression.

861
00:58:32,956 --> 00:58:35,254
Bring your face this way.

862
00:58:37,227 --> 00:58:39,252
I feel like they're only
gonna write nice things...

863
00:58:39,296 --> 00:58:43,528
...about you because I feel like that
would be really mean to say...

864
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:48,903
"Oh, we're gonna have...
a photo shoot. "

865
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:50,566
It would be like tricking you.

866
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:53,371
It would be like,
"We just want to take a picture-

867
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,275
So people can see
what you look like...

868
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:58,770
...when we write
bad things about you. "

869
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,976
I don't think
they ever do that.

870
00:59:01,017 --> 00:59:02,985
- I don't think they would.
- No.

871
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,247
It doesn't mean
they'll say good things.

872
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:09,258
Yeah, I agree.
I don't think I'm being tricked.

873
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,089
Are you in on this?

874
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:15,962
No...
All I do is take pictures.

875
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:18,126
I get hired to show up
and take the pictures.

876
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,427
Actually, I would really like to see...

877
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,768
...pictures of the two
of you guys together.

878
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:24,797
- Really?
- I think it would be fun.

879
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:25,967
This wasn't my idea.

880
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:27,977
<i>I mean, they couldn't
use it for The Times...</i>

881
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,171
Get in here.

882
00:59:29,212 --> 00:59:31,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

883
00:59:31,715 --> 00:59:34,548
We gotta put these matching
outfits to good use.

884
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,552
Oh, that's cute.

885
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:42,621
I didn't realize
you guys were matching.

886
00:59:42,659 --> 00:59:43,353
I feel weird.

887
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:46,055
I didn't do anything
to deserve this.

888
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:47,723
I didn't make a video game.

889
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:49,857
But these are just pictures
for the two of you guys.

890
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,162
These are for us. Shut up.

891
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:53,328
You guys look like
a really cute couple.

892
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,928
Yeah, we're a
really cute couple.

893
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:57,132
- Stop ruining it.
- Couple of what?

894
00:59:58,575 --> 01:00:00,065
All right.

895
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:03,345
Oh, that's cute.

896
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,941
Maybe you put your hands
also in her back pockets.

897
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:09,679
In each other's back pockets.

898
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:10,515
We're just doing...

899
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:12,885
I look like I'm stealing
something from you.

900
01:00:12,923 --> 01:00:15,118
It looks like you're
grabbing some booty.

901
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:17,786
It's cute.

902
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:19,954
O.K., be serious, both of you.

903
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:21,691
Perfect.

904
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:24,359
I might've been too serious.

905
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,369
Can I try one more?

906
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:28,667
Oh! It looks like you guys
are gonna kiss.

907
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:29,569
You guys should kiss.

908
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:31,836
I don'wanna, I don'wanna...

909
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,570
We'll do one more serious.

910
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:35,237
O.K.

911
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:38,505
You were laughing.

912
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:47,550
I like that. You're looking
up at him adoringly.

913
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,387
You were looking up
at me adoringly?

914
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:51,223
No, she's a liar.

915
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,461
You direct... totally.

916
01:00:54,497 --> 01:00:55,759
Can we go back to, like...

917
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,790
...the one where I said
you guys should be kissing?

918
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:58,664
It'll be cute.

919
01:00:58,702 --> 01:00:59,964
- O.K.
- No?

920
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:01,402
And what do you mean by that?

921
01:01:01,438 --> 01:01:02,632
Face each other and kiss.

922
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:04,572
You mean we should be
kissing and cute?

923
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:06,234
All right.

924
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,746
Cute!

925
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:18,777
You just gotta put your hands
somewhere else...

926
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:21,791
...like maybe put your hands
around his shoulders.

927
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:22,792
Like this?

928
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,293
Yeah.

929
01:01:27,464 --> 01:01:28,761
Cute.

930
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:32,530
You guys have swapped a lot
more cooties than that, I bet.

931
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:37,230
- That's a good one.
- That's a good one?

932
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:38,035
Yeah.

933
01:01:38,074 --> 01:01:40,099
Hiding in shame.

934
01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:47,613
- Do it with me.
- O.K.

935
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,777
It would be like...
Get in the back.

936
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,047
It would be like this.

937
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:51,644
Uh-huh.

938
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:53,781
And, like, there'd be
a boy in front of me...

939
01:01:53,823 --> 01:01:55,450
...and then a girl in front of him.

940
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:58,723
And it would be like,
"Let me see you tootsie roll!"

941
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,462
- "To the left, to the left... "
- That's so obscene.

942
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,467
And everybody would be
doing it, and there would be...

943
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,696
30 kids humping each other.

944
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:08,465
And it's called
a "freak train?"

945
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,166
It's called a freak train.

946
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,299
I can't ever remember doing that.

947
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:14,810
I was more like slow-dancey...

948
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:20,544
...and it was more like arms
on waist and then maybe...

949
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:23,848
Not butt, you know, but, like,
maybe move in for, like-

950
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:25,946
- Yeah.
- That kind of thing.

951
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,423
- No, I didn't do that.
- No?

952
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,426
I did do a freak train once.

953
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:35,896
I do remember once...

954
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:40,198
I don't know why we're talking
about this, but I do remember once...

955
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:43,262
I wanted to dance with this guy -

956
01:02:43,306 --> 01:02:45,774
...this guy, Matteo Shoro.

957
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:48,209
And it was in...
Did I tell you this story?

958
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:48,972
Mm-mmm.

959
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:50,673
I can't remember what stories...

960
01:02:50,713 --> 01:02:56,015
Anyway...
And we were doing... freak dancing...

961
01:02:56,052 --> 01:03:01,217
...but just the two of us and he...

962
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:03,418
We were, like,
our rhythms were off.

963
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:06,224
Like, I was swinging this way
and he was swinging the other way...

964
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:08,230
...so our knees kept knocking.

965
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:10,789
It was like,
boom, boom, boom.

966
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:12,461
It was just all wrong.

967
01:03:12,502 --> 01:03:16,962
And then, um...
And then...

968
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,974
Uh...

969
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:28,211
I don't know.

970
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:30,776
You don't know how
that story ends?

971
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,378
No.

972
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:35,251
I guess the end of that story...

973
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,919
...is that I still feel embarrassed
when I think about it.

974
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:42,598
We danced a whole song
with the rhythm off.

975
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,295
Anyway, um...

976
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:51,841
I should go wash my face
or something.

977
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:58,444
My eyes were closed and all
I felt was, like, like, hair.

978
01:03:58,481 --> 01:03:59,914
Sensation on your forehead.

979
01:03:59,949 --> 01:04:01,974
And I was, like,
it's a monkey.

980
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:04,145
It's attacking.

981
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:10,382
What's that move?

982
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:12,894
- What are you doing?
- Guess who I am?

983
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:16,524
You're a tree kangaroo...
Sleeping.

984
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:19,034
A baby one.

985
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:21,466
I know. They're so cute.

986
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:23,972
- Good night.
- Good night.

987
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:29,171
Um... I should...

988
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:34,542
Um...

989
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:35,812
I'm gonna go-

990
01:04:35,852 --> 01:04:36,784
Wash your face?

991
01:04:36,819 --> 01:04:39,344
Wash my face.
And, um...

992
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:40,754
Yeah.

993
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:20,325
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

994
01:05:20,363 --> 01:05:22,331
What?

995
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:11,437
Hey.

996
01:06:13,383 --> 01:06:16,375
Oh, God, I thought...

997
01:06:16,419 --> 01:06:19,911
I thought this would be really
funny if I wore this robe...

998
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:22,584
...and it's not funny and, uh,
it's not funny.

999
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:26,356
I just thought, wow, it's so
weird hotels have robes and...

1000
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:27,226
Do, do-do...

1001
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:29,288
Where are you going?

1002
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:30,924
I'm gonna go back.
I'm gonna change.

1003
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,434
Wait, no, no, no.
Come here, come here.

1004
01:06:32,468 --> 01:06:34,436
- No, no, I'm wearing a robe.
- Hey, come here.

1005
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:38,107
Still wearing a weird robe.

1006
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:42,568
What is going on?

1007
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:46,445
Put your hand in your pocket.

1008
01:06:46,482 --> 01:06:48,609
Put your hand in your pocket,
in your robe pocket.

1009
01:06:48,651 --> 01:06:50,915
O.K., that just made it funny.

1010
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:52,921
Let's do it all again.

1011
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:54,149
No.

1012
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,748
No, no, no.

1013
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:57,419
- Shut up.
- Watch, watch, watch, O.K.?

1014
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:00,560
Hey...

1015
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:02,689
That's what
I'm talking about.

1016
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:04,097
That's comedy, yeah.

1017
01:07:04,133 --> 01:07:06,067
I still feel a little
weird about this.

1018
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:08,400
You can feel weird,
but you better sit down here...

1019
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:10,838
...and eat some pizza with me
because I'm feeling hungry.

1020
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,135
Yeah, I'll put my-

1021
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:13,540
Drop 'em.

1022
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:19,807
Oh, man, I would offer to
also put on the other robe...

1023
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:21,578
...but I don't think I want to.

1024
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:22,811
Oh... I don't blame you.

1025
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:25,116
I feel like a fucking idiot.

1026
01:07:26,622 --> 01:07:29,284
Well, look, I'm gonna
leave you here to feel...

1027
01:07:29,325 --> 01:07:30,917
...like an idiot and you should
start eating pizza...

1028
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,985
'cause I have
to go make a phone call...

1029
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:38,092
...so I'll be right back and you
can, uh, start without me, O.K.?

1030
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:40,762
Here's the remote
if you wanna watch TV.

1031
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:42,896
Maybe you can turn it
to the Robe Channel...

1032
01:07:42,939 --> 01:07:45,908
...and there might be
some interesting programming on.

1033
01:07:45,942 --> 01:07:47,739
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

1034
01:07:47,777 --> 01:07:49,938
O.K., enjoy yourself.

1035
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:51,776
I hope you're comfortable.

1036
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:53,145
I will be right back.

1037
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:56,549
I will be feeling
like an idiot...

1038
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:59,384
...in all ways.

1039
01:08:06,062 --> 01:08:08,053
- That's nice.
- Were you scared?

1040
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,496
Oh, that's nice.

1041
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:11,397
Were you scared today,
of taking pictures?

1042
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:12,196
No.

1043
01:08:12,235 --> 01:08:13,429
Was it scary?

1044
01:08:13,469 --> 01:08:15,460
- That one is nice.
- It wasn't that scary.

1045
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:16,529
It was fun.

1046
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:18,839
That's funny.

1047
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,934
You have your hands
on my butt.

1048
01:08:20,977 --> 01:08:22,706
Yeah, I do.

1049
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:24,576
Now I have my hands
on your butt.

1050
01:08:24,614 --> 01:08:27,105
I still have my hands on your butt.

1051
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,209
It's funny that she posed us like that...

1052
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:30,913
...thinking we were
boyfriend and girlfriend...

1053
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:33,922
...because we, we would never
even pose like that anyway.

1054
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:36,356
Never do that, like,
never, ever.

1055
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:38,360
It's really weird, right?

1056
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:42,157
- Why did we get all serious?
- I don't know.

1057
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:46,926
That's cute.

1058
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:50,427
She kept saying you
were looking at me longingly.

1059
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:52,065
You remember
she kept saying that?

1060
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:54,076
That's not even true.

1061
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,140
Nuh-uh.

1062
01:08:58,181 --> 01:08:59,876
Your hands are
really cool there.

1063
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,975
Yeah, they're so much closer.

1064
01:09:02,018 --> 01:09:04,714
This one's lit
and that one's not lit.

1065
01:09:08,724 --> 01:09:10,021
How weird.

1066
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:12,550
Oh, man, how weird.

1067
01:09:12,595 --> 01:09:15,086
I'm really squishing your nose.
Look at that.

1068
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:17,759
I know, it's so funny.

1069
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:22,237
Aww.

1070
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:31,140
How weird that
these pictures exist.

1071
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:33,239
I know, totally.

1072
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:37,981
They're like, they're like
present us, only, like...

1073
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,855
...acting out past us, right?

1074
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:44,655
They're, like, out of time.

1075
01:09:44,694 --> 01:09:46,719
They're weird.

1076
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:58,001
That one's really good.

1077
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,008
It's good.

1078
01:10:07,483 --> 01:10:09,678
It's, like, less jokey.

1079
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,346
Mm-hmm.

1080
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:01,932
Hey...

1081
01:11:03,506 --> 01:11:05,269
Hey.

1082
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,307
Hold on, hold on.

1083
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,818
Hold on, baby.

1084
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:20,682
Come here.

1085
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:24,550
Come here, baby.

1086
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,970
Lift your head up.

1087
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:42,777
I just wanna feel you.

1088
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:43,540
Yeah?

1089
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:45,570
Yeah.

1090
01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:49,016
I want you to feel me.

1091
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:14,469
You wanna fuck me?

1092
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,478
- What?
- Do you want to fuck me?

1093
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:21,844
I like kissing you, baby.

1094
01:12:22,418 --> 01:12:24,648
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you feel good.

1095
01:12:49,779 --> 01:12:51,872
Can I fuck you?

1096
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:59,914
Yeah... You wanna fuck me?

1097
01:12:59,955 --> 01:13:01,252
I wanna fuck you.

1098
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:04,282
Of course you can fuck me.

1099
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:06,294
O.K.

1100
01:13:09,131 --> 01:13:12,430
Do you want to be
on top of me?

1101
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:15,437
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1102
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:17,098
O.K., baby.

1103
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:19,130
Do you want me to be on top?

1104
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:23,503
- Sure.
- Yeah?

1105
01:13:23,546 --> 01:13:25,514
O.K.

1106
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,815
I'm gonna take this off, O.K.?

1107
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,519
O.K.

1108
01:14:15,598 --> 01:14:17,566
Let me take
this off too, O.K.?

1109
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,568
Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:23,937
Hold on.

1111
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:26,669
Oh, yeah, that's good.

1112
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,678
That's good, that's good...

1113
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,408
Oh, yeah...

1114
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:39,713
O.K.

1115
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:41,723
Oh, yeah...

1116
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:52,300
Yeah...

1117
01:14:57,773 --> 01:14:59,104
Yeah, I don't know, it's...

1118
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:01,041
Look, hey...

1119
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:03,169
Can you...

1120
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:06,238
Do you think
you can get me wet?

1121
01:15:06,282 --> 01:15:07,909
Yeah, what do you
want me to do?

1122
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:09,349
Like, lick me.

1123
01:15:09,385 --> 01:15:11,785
- Do you think that's...
- Yeah.

1124
01:15:11,821 --> 01:15:14,153
Why don't you bring yourself up here?

1125
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:15,817
You...

1126
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:18,092
Slide yourself up here.

1127
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:21,528
No. I don't...
No.

1128
01:15:21,564 --> 01:15:22,997
What do you want me to do?

1129
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:24,158
I don't like that.

1130
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,964
You know that I don't like that.

1131
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:34,835
Why don't you...

1132
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:38,335
Why don't you come...

1133
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,248
- Just lay down with me?
- Let me just try it again...

1134
01:15:42,284 --> 01:15:43,273
Hey, come here.

1135
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:45,287
What?
Where do you want me to go?

1136
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:47,585
I want you to come
lay down here.

1137
01:15:47,623 --> 01:15:50,251
We don't have to have
sex right now.

1138
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:53,923
We can just lay down and-

1139
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,591
Lay down and what?

1140
01:15:56,632 --> 01:15:58,600
And relax...

1141
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:03,464
And we can have sex later.

1142
01:16:03,505 --> 01:16:05,473
Later?

1143
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:09,204
We're gonna relax
and have sex later?

1144
01:16:35,671 --> 01:16:37,935
What are you doing?

1145
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:42,244
I'm trying to hold you.

1146
01:17:21,583 --> 01:17:28,690
I gotta go.

1147
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:36,164
O.K.?

1148
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,228
You gotta go.

1149
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:46,834
I gotta go.

1150
01:18:01,423 --> 01:18:03,891
It's gonna be O.K.

1151
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:09,326
O.K.?

1152
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,535
I gotta go.

1153
