1
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,676
   - Let me see your lighter.

2
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,412
     We should start a band
    called Twisted Erection.

3
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,089
 - This is some good weed, man.

4
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:33,125
       - Hell yeah, man
       and a good joint.

5
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,562
       Rolled by<i> moi</i> , oh!

6
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,906
Caught the fox.

7
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,143
      Where you going you
        little shit ass?

8
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,244
        - Fuck you, Hom.

9
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:25,911
           - Fuck me?

10
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:26,712
         Eat some dirt.

11
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,714
         - Fuckin' pig.

12
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,836
       - We weren't even
        doing anything.

13
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,240
     - Then why'd you run?

14
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,509
        - I don't know.

15
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,714
        - Must have been
        doin' something.

16
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,066
      I like your mother,
      I'm taking you home.

17
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,437
    You gotta stop this shit
  and never run from me again.

18
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,282
      I brought him home.

19
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,652
- Adam,
       you okay, sweetie?

20
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,120
     - Yeah, mom, I'm fine.

21
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,959
       - Alright, listen,
        go to bed, okay?

22
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,861
- Night, Adam.

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,034
 Was having Adam a hard birth?

24
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,138
  Did he not want to come out?

25
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,508
         Did he want to
      stay inside of you?

26
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,578
        Did you have to
      have an episiotomy?

27
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,147
         When you have
    an episiotomy the vaginal

28
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,817
      canal is about this
       close to the anus.

29
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,652
        And if they cut
      too much, you know,

30
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,088
        you can get all
      kinds of infections.

31
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,725
       - No, man, he was
        a natural birth.

32
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,560
        There was really
        almost no labor.

33
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,462
     - Well, my mother has
     to have an episiotomy.

34
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,531
    They had to rip her open
because I didn't wanna come out.

35
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,201
    And my father, he'd get
    all drunk and he'd yell

36
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,369
          at my mother
      because that she had

37
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,837
       me her hole wasn't
         tight anymore.

38
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,939
      - Oh, listen, thanks
     for bringing him home.

39
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,973
    - Oh, yeah, no problem.

40
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,774
- Goodnight.

41
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,075
            - Okay.

42
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,619
         - Hey, Vossie.

43
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,989
Good morning, step up, come on.

44
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,292
             Yeah.

45
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,227
         Good morning.

46
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,835
       Come on, BT, wake
      up the birthday boy.

47
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,539
     Come on, hey, sweetie,
      it's time to get up.

48
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,942
     Come on birthday boy.

49
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:25,817
              Hey.

50
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,485
- Hi-yi.

51
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,719
- Hi-yi.

52
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:30,989
        - Good morning.

53
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,724
           - Morning.

54
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,263
       - So, um, what was
      going on last night?

55
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,401
      - Um, me and Jessie
        was just walking

56
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,370
      and we saw them come
       up behind us with

57
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,672
     their lights on and we
     just started running.

58
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,410
      But we got to, like,
     the ditch and I turned

59
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,645
       and I guess Jessie
         went straight.

60
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,315
        And I just felt
      somebody behind me,

61
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,018
     tackled me, and it was
      him, he tackled me.

62
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,387
- What do
    you mean he tackled you?

63
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,289
- I was running and he just came

64
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,925
 up behind me and jumped at me.

65
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,027
- I know
    why he was stopping you.

66
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,597
   He's stopping you because
  he thinks you're a wetback.

67
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,633
            That's--

68
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:15,534
            - Yeah.

69
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,868
- That sucks.

70
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,170
       - I don't ever see
     the white kids getting

71
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,706
 pulled over by border patrol.

72
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,644
  - Oh, Adam, I don't like it.

73
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,215
     You gotta be careful.

74
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,685
     I mean, I know you're
   not doing anything wrong,

75
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,389
  but just don't give them any
   kind of excuse to do that

76
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,725
or to have any contact with you.

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,161
   Those guys just seem like
     they're outta control.

78
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,096
  They do whatever they want.

79
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,568
       Alright, sweetie,
   listen, you gotta get up.

80
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,038
     You gotta get up now,
  you've got some chores to do

81
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,607
and then you gotta go to school.

82
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,562
- Hey.

83
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,199
         There you go.

84
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,637
- Good
   morning Marfa High School,

85
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,106
      please stand for our
     pledges to our flags.

86
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:12,277
 We will begin with our pledge
   to the United States flag.

87
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,713
- I pledge
    allegiance to the flag,

88
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,581
of the United States of America,

89
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,017
      and to the Republic
      for which it stands,

90
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,354
        one nation under
       God, indivisible,

91
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,856
        with liberty and
        justice for all.

92
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,492
- And now we
   will honor the Texas flag.

93
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,127
- Honor the Texas flag,

94
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,963
      I pledge allegiance
        to thee, Texas,

95
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,500
      one state under God,
      one and indivisible.

96
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,402
- Thank
    you, you may be seated.

97
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,572
   This morning we just have
   a couple of announcements.

98
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,242
    First of all, teachers,
   you are reminded that you

99
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,745
    need to post attendance
        within the first

100
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:49,714
       10 minutes of each
      class period today.

101
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,484
         And the second
   announcement of the day is

102
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:57,155
      a congratulations to
     our UIL Academic Team

103
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,725
     as we put the whippin'
      on Crane and Kermit

104
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,827
     yesterday in the first
    half of the competition.

105
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,997
      We lead the district
      by over 100 points,

106
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,402
   so way to go, let's finish
tomorrow up with a championship

107
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:13,638
      and everybody have a
     great day, thank you.

108
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,607
- So,
     the people have taken

109
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:19,077
   Marie Antoinette and King
Louie the XVI and the children,

110
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,079
   they've broken into their
    home and they take them

111
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,548
     to the guillotine and
      they kill them all.

112
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,617
        And this is the
       French Revolution,

113
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,586
     France will have a new
     government after this.

114
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:32,357
      At the same time the
      English fighting the

115
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,628
  American colonists and this
   is where we get America's.

116
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,597
       These revolutions
      have created a whole

117
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:42,333
  new world for us, the world
     we're living in today.

118
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,334
     So, this is a major--

119
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,837
- point in history.

120
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,331
      Adam, get over here.

121
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,338
     Seriously, we can't be
      having this anymore.

122
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,407
  I cut you all this slack and
 you're sleeping through class.

123
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,777
 You know what's gonna happen?

124
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,779
     I have to send you to
     the principal and this

125
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,447
        time he's gonna
      give you a paddling.

126
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,049
     Do you want a paddling
     on your 16th birthday?

127
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,284
             - No.

128
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,154
        - Then what am I
       gonna do with you?

129
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,123
 You're sleeping through class,

130
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,925
         you're smart,
      you're a bright boy.

131
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,329
       Ah, she's kicking.

132
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,967
       - I can feel her.

133
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,402
- It's crazy, right?

134
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,570
            - Yeah.

135
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,238
        When is she due?

136
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,574
      - In about a month,
      when's school's out.

137
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,242
       - Oh, that's cool.

138
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,413
- Maybe I won't
   send you to the principal,

139
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,450
         but you still
      deserve a paddling.

140
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,286
Maybe I'll give you a spanking.

141
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,721
      A birthday spanking?

142
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,963
            16, huh?

143
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,233
              One.

144
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,637
- Two.

145
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,673
Three.

146
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,476
- Four.

147
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:07,612
             Five.

148
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:08,980
- Ow.

149
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,215
             - Six.

150
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,350
             Seven.

151
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,352
             Eight.

152
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,291
- Nine.

153
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:20,959
             - Ah.

154
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:24,195
- 10.

155
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,330
              11.

156
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:26,965
              12.

157
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,302
- 13.

158
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,204
Mmm!

159
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,973
              14.

160
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,409
- 15.

161
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,611
             - Ow.

162
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:40,612
- 16.

163
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,649
And one to grow on.

164
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,618
             - Ow.

165
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,289
        - How was that?

166
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,024
- It hurt.

167
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,659
- You gonna
    sleep in my class again?

168
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,194
           - No, no.

169
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,662
- Are you gonna pass this grade?

170
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,730
             - Yes.

171
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:03,001
  - Alright, get out of here.

172
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,273
- He
        was out running

173
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,374
         around when he
      shouldn't have been,

174
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,142
         but he wasn't
      doing anything bad.

175
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,411
  And then Tom picked him up.

176
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,381
    You know, when he moved
      here he was married

177
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:20,184
  and he had a couple of kids,
 a son and a daughter I think.

178
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:25,256
  And rumor has it that he was
   a wife beater and his wife

179
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,827
 ended up getting sole custody
     of the kids and moving

180
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,864
    away because he knocked
      her around too much.

181
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,465
         When they were
      together they lived

182
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,069
   on the outskirts of town,
      Tom had Rottweilers.

183
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:43,408
    And, um, big scary dogs,
    big macho dogs like him.

184
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,310
  He'd cut their vocal chords.

185
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,444
            - Jesus.

186
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,079
        - So they would
      sneak up on people.

187
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,614
        You know, you're
     walking by the fence,

188
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,050
     you wouldn't know the
     dog is there and then

189
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,820
     suddenly this big mean
   thing would lunge at you.

190
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,389
         And supposedly
    anything that went over

191
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,725
the fence was ripped to shreds.

192
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,261
        Neighbors' cats,
    neighbors' dogs, a fox.

193
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,296
         I think he was
      really proud of it.

194
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,558
- What
        ya reading, man?

195
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,592
- What?

196
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,060
     What are you reading?

197
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,029
         - Paper, man.

198
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,213
      - How are you today?

199
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,681
        - My feet hurt.

200
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,717
        - Yeah, if your
      tits weren't so big

201
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,252
    your feet wouldn't hurt.

202
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,287
          - Whoa, hey.

203
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,156
         Sorry, amigo.

204
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,066
  What's wrong with you, man?

205
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,968
You can't talk to her like that.

206
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,139
    Can't talk to girls like
     that, do you hear me?

207
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,974
         - Just relax.

208
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:27,145
      - Rela--I have a 16
       year old daughter,

209
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,914
     same age as that girl,

210
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,651
      would you talk to my
       daughter that way?

211
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,853
             - No.

212
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:36,821
     - You wouldn't talk to
    her that way, would you?

213
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,222
              Why?

214
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,126
     - She's your daughter.

215
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,733
    - So, why is it okay to
     talk to her that way?

216
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,069
       You walk in here,
      'cause you're here.

217
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,612
            - Sorry.

218
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,081
     - You should probably
     apologize to her, man.

219
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,684
  - Are you really sorry? Hmm?

220
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,519
- I am, but--

221
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,022
- You are, you're really sorry.

222
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,224
     It was pretty idiotic.

223
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,895
     You act like a moron.

224
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,244
          - What's up?

225
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,446
        Happy Birthday!

226
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,914
- Thanks.

227
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,084
       What up, dude? Yo.

228
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,752
         - Yo, what up,
      Happy Birthday, man.

229
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,454
         - Thanks, man.

230
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,060
           Hey, hey.

231
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,898
           What's up?

232
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,400
- What's
      up, how was school?

233
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:37,768
       - It's pretty gay.

234
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,970
     - Whatcha do now, man?

235
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:39,870
    - What do you mean now?

236
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,005
   So I get bitched at, like,

237
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,273
         every day by a
       different teacher.

238
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,975
 - Were you saying stupid shit?

239
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,377
  - And I'm smarter than half
    the motherfuckers there.

240
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,678
- Yeah, but
       you do dumb shit.

241
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,779
          - Like what?

242
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,014
- Like being dumb.

243
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,750
- You don't know what's up, man.

244
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,985
- Oh, I do know what's up.

245
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,253
          - What's up?

246
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,887
    - I know what's up, I'm
     not in school anymore.

247
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,761
Yeah, I talked to Miguel today,

248
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,097
       he got transferred
        over to El Paso.

249
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,198
- Oh, really?

250
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,466
- Yeah it sucks,

251
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,967
        like, I have to
     drive four and a half

252
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,536
        hours just so Ty
      can see his dad now.

253
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,438
      - That sucks, yeah.

254
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,806
- I mean, I can't afford the gas

255
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,942
        and I can't even
       freakin' get a job

256
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,111
because nobody's gonna watch Ty.

257
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,046
           My mom...

258
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,782
           Yeah, so.

259
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,550
      I don't know, I was
    thinking maybe I'd start

260
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,519
dancing professionally up there.

261
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,688
- I think you can
  do that, you're pretty hot.

262
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,322
            - Yeah?

263
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,123
            - Yeah.

264
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,424
    - You think I'm alright?

265
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,493
- Yeah, show
      us your mad skills.

266
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,496
       - I don't know, I
       might be too shy.

267
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:39,930
- Can I be your DJ?

268
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,600
    - Yeah you can be my DJ,
 we're bringing the KAOSS pad.

269
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,668
- What can I be?

270
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,835
    - You can be my bouncer.

271
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:45,970
- Bouncer?      -

272
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,571
- I'm too
    skinny to be a bouncer.

273
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,608
  Me and Jess, dude, that'd be
 like the worst bouncers ever.

274
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,110
- You could be my makeup artist
   and do my makeup.

275
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,913
     - I don't know if I'd
    be good at that, but...

276
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,283
      - How's Inez doing?

277
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,085
    - Uh, she's doing good.

278
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:01,719
            - Yeah?

279
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,953
            - Yeah.

280
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,056
       - Her parents are
      pretty cool, right?

281
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,590
- Her mom's pretty cool,

282
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,792
    her dad's a dick though.

283
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,026
- Yeah, you just don't like him

284
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,395
       'cause he doesn't
       let you fuck her.

285
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:15,433
  - Yeah, well, that's nothing
   he can stop me from doing.

286
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,233
           - Oh yeah?

287
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,368
            - Yeah.

288
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,036
      - Are you guys gonna
        go all the way?

289
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,305
    - Yeah, hopefully soon.

290
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,211
     - Kill the roach, man.

291
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,280
 - I need to give you a fuckin'

292
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,482
 Happy Birthday present, right?

293
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,417
  - You do? It is my birthday.

294
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:34,885
         - Yeah, it is.

295
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,388
    I'll think of something.

296
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,353
 I can't believe you're hanging
 out with me on your birthday.

297
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,625
- There's nothing
    else to do in this town.

298
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,828
   - Well, I didn't even get
    you a birthday present.

299
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,763
      - You don't have to.

300
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,766
   - Maybe I should give you
    a birthday strip tease.

301
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,840
     I need help practicing
        for my new job.

302
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,141
      - Being a stripper?

303
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,844
           - Mm-hmm.

304
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,448
      So, you have to tell
       me what you think.

305
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,148
- Miguel's gonna kill me.

306
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,585
- Come on, you know,
  he's the one who's in jail.

307
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,545
             - Hi.

308
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,180
          - Hey, Tom.

309
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,782
    - Uh, I'll have a number
      two, can I add some

310
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,350
        cheese and some
       jalapeños on that?

311
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,985
- Sure.

312
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:35,919
         Anything else?

313
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,321
 - Yeah, I'll have a diet Coke.

314
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,322
            - Okay.

315
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,523
      - So, how you been?

316
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,425
 - Good, working all the time.

317
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:42,459
- Working all the time?

318
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:43,927
    You're always so happy.

319
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,230
- I'm not happy, I'm a waitress.

320
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,500
- When's
       your next day off?

321
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,501
          - Saturday.

322
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,802
          - Saturday.

323
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,203
            - Yeah.

324
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,774
    - I was wondering, think
     I could take you out?

325
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,745
            - Sure.

326
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:03,380
How 'bout 7:30?

327
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,515
            - Yeah.

328
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,250
       - Sweet, I'll pick
         you up at 7:30

329
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,018
        and make sure to
       bring that smile.

330
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,154
- So, um...

331
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,188
      - What do I owe ya?

332
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,989
            - $4.00.

333
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,824
            - $4.00.

334
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,413
- That was hot.

335
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,084
   You've been a naughty boy.

336
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,393
        Can I spank you?

337
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,296
         - If you want.

338
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,576
- How's it going?

339
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,111
 I haven't seen you in awhile.

340
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:16,480
- These past couple of
 months have been pretty hard.

341
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:23,620
 My cat got really sick and he
 died actually a few weeks ago.

342
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,155
        - I'm so sorry.

343
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,292
     - Yeah, it was pretty
    wild discovering exactly

344
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:32,863
  who he was to me and why he
  came into my life, you know.

345
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,733
       He knew all along,
       but I had no idea.

346
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,737
        I guess, I mean,
      he was already four

347
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,306
        years old when I
       met him, you know.

348
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,740
       I only had him for
       two and half years

349
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,610
      and those two and a
     half years, you know,

350
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:51,682
   discovered that, well, he
    was born and his mom had

351
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,588
       abandoned him and
        he needed a mom.

352
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,724
       So, he came to me,
     but discovered that we

353
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,895
     had several past lives
together, really traumatic ones

354
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,131
  that we both needed to heal
 before he could move forward.

355
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,399
- Yeah.

356
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:12,469
     - And it was probably
    one of the most intense

357
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,304
        things I've ever
    experienced, too, and...

358
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,772
             - Oh.

359
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,211
- He died in my arms peacefully,

360
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,247
         it was really
      profound getting to

361
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,984
- I'm sorry.
-    - see him take his

362
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,986
- last breath,
      it's okay, you know.

363
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:32,155
      He was suffering so
      much, he had cancer.

364
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,661
    And now he's everywhere,
       you know we attach

365
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,763
         so much to the
      physical, you know.

366
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,199
      I just realized that
      now he's everywhere,

367
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,434
   that he's always with me.

368
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,003
- There's
something reassuring about that.

369
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,204
            - Right.

370
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:49,740
       - I think, as hard
     as it is to lose them

371
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,809
 in the physical world to know
   that they're still there.

372
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,679
   - A friend of mine offered
   to let me bury him at his

373
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,248
    ranch and I had a really
    beautiful ceremony there

374
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,885
       and buried him in
    between two trees and...

375
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,488
      put him back in the
        earth, you know?

376
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,989
- To let him grow.
-    - It's funny,

377
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:07,724
- I couldn't
   do that, remember Jasmine?

378
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,226
           - Mm-hmm.

379
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,695
 - The too? When she died, she
   died in my arms here, too.

380
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:12,896
- Uh-huh.

381
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,731
    - And there's something
      about the harshness,

382
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,533
       I don't think she
      was meant for here.

383
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,634
- Right.

384
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,203
      - I just, I couldn't
         deal with it.

385
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,439
       I couldn't put her
      in the ground here,

386
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,043
       I didn't want her
     here and her mate was

387
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:30,280
     with us when she died
     and we're really still

388
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,616
      and I wrapped her in
     this beautiful scarf.

389
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,884
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:35,619
    - And I put her in a box
    in the freezer actually.

391
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:36,853
       - Oh my goodness.

392
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,389
     - Because I was taking
      her back to New York

393
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,858
       and I didn't know
      how to preserve her.

394
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,930
       I just, every core
      of my cellular being

395
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,100
       would not allow me
       to leave her here.

396
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,535
- Right.

397
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,003
    - I didn't think it was
   good, I thought the place

398
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,907
   had a bad spirit, so I put
 her in this box, I froze her.

399
00:32:58,177 --> 00:32:59,609
- Which
     sounds a little harsh,

400
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,280
   but one day I had her mate
     on my shoulder, Gucci,

401
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,082
        and I opened up
       the freezer to get

402
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,718
       something out and
        he saw the box.

403
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,219
He had watched me do everything,

404
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,655
      he was very intently
     focused on me wrapping

405
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,659
     her in this scarf and
     placing her in the box

406
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,794
       and he flew in the
     freezer and he spread

407
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:20,464
       his wings over and
      kind of was crying.

408
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,531
- Awww.

409
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:22,899
    - And it just killed me.

410
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:24,768
- Oh my gosh.

411
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,373
      - So, it still does.

412
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,441
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:35,512
    - But anyway, we got her
     to New York and I flew

414
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:40,484
    her there and, you know,
   she was almost thawed out

415
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,985
- - when I got

416
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,087
- to the house
 and we put her in the ground.

417
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,024
    So, and she's there and
     I feel good about it.

418
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,592
    - Yeah, it's beautiful.

419
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,760
- Good.

420
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,131
Yeah, wow, they just

421
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,999
      have such an impact
         on your life.

422
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,769
- Well, I
     have several teachers.

423
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,238
- I mean, you come
  from a long line of healers.

424
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,374
       - I mean, my dad's
     side, natural healers,

425
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,910
um, come from Mexico, but um...

426
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:07,577
- Hey!

427
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,545
          - Hey, guys.

428
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,346
- How's it goin'?

429
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:10,547
      - Good, how are you?

430
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:11,715
- Good,
        good to see you.

431
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,682
- Hi.
-       - Hi, Rodrigo.

432
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,617
      - Nice to meet you.

433
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,618
      - Nice to meet you.

434
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,285
- Hi.

435
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,453
        - Hi, I'm Tina.

436
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,287
Nice to meet you.

437
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,522
      - Nice to meet you.

438
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,092
       - So, what kind of
    healer was your father?

439
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,297
  - Oh, well, my dad's dad was
   what they call a huesero.

440
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,066
Hueso in Spanish means bone, so.

441
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,333
- Hueso?

442
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,436
     - Hueso, so people at
     the village would come

443
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:35,705
    to him with their ailing
   bones and he would, like,

444
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,874
  kind of like a chiropractor,
     pop them back in place

445
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:42,279
  and do massage and limpias,
      which is, you know,

446
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,981
 cleansing of the energy field.

447
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,717
      And so yeah, people
         would do that

448
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,486
      and I don't think he
     would charge anything.

449
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:50,821
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:54,524
    - Often times healers in
     villages don't charge,

451
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,526
 they just, by donation, yeah.

452
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,462
    - What's sound healing?

453
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,531
- Well, basically
    they say that the world

454
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,335
 is sound and everything in it
 is and responds to vibration.

455
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,872
   Whatever experience it is
    that you're remembering

456
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:13,944
  or that needs healing, sound
  I've discovered is the most

457
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,048
   profound way to help move
   that, to help clear that.

458
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,216
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,484
            - Um---

460
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,885
- Would I
    make, would you teach me

461
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:25,188
    how to make noises, like
 sounds to help me heal myself

462
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,191
 or would it be like something
      you would do for me?

463
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:31,128
- Well, they say, like, humming,

464
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,164
      they say humming is
     like internal massage.

465
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,567
  So, say if you're anxious or
nervous or something like that.

466
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,337
So, if you just.

467
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,174
- So, what brings you into town?

468
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,476
     Are you a native or...

469
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,878
- I'm an artist,

470
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,212
- Oh, cool.
-  - I'm here doing

471
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,914
- a
   residency at Chinati, so.

472
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,349
- Very nice.

473
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:53,483
- I
     just get to hang out.

474
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,152
        - So, are you a
      painter? Is that...

475
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,052
- I've
        been doing a lot

476
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,687
 of drawing, a lot of painting.

477
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,956
      - Okay, so what kind
    of portraits do you do?

478
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,260
      - Um, well, actually
     I've been doing nudes.

479
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,362
- Oh, okay, cool.

480
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:09,766
    - Yeah, since coming out
   here I guess the landscape

481
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,836
      kind of inspired me
      to strip things down

482
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,039
    and just get, you know,
      the bare essentials.

483
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,609
   I find it more beautiful,
       less distracting.

484
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,245
- No, that's
awesome, I'd be actually really

485
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,882
   interested in checking out
  your stuff, that'd be cool.

486
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:26,850
Well, I'm sure you'd

487
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,418
    make an excellent model.

488
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,654
- Oh, well, thanks, I don't know

489
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,455
 what makes a good nude model,

490
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,424
  but, yeah, I'd love to come

491
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,992
       and check out the
        studio sometime.

492
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,160
- That's be great.
-      - Yeah.

493
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,429
    - That would be amazing,
       it's actually just

494
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,765
       a short walk that
       way, we could go--

495
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,033
- Really?

496
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,568
     - Yeah, we could just
     walk over there later.

497
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,902
- Okay.

498
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,418
       I still beat you.

499
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,355
Hold still, I'll beat you soon.

500
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,334
        I mean, I don't
      see it, I dream it.

501
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,736
I dream of that.

502
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,695
Ladies and gentlemen, for their
  first show, The Marfabaters!

503
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,634
             - Hey.

504
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:19,769
     - Hey, there, Smiles.

505
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,076
             - Hi.

506
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,714
- Thank you, buckle
 up, it's gonna be a fun ride.

507
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,291
       Did you date much
        in high school?

508
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:45,328
      - No, not at all, I
      had three brothers.

509
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,097
They didn't let me do anything.

510
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,168
     It was actually really
        awful, you know.

511
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,203
        To have someone,
     like, protect you that

512
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,039
 much and be so overprotective.

513
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,840
- Mm-hmm.

514
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,442
- I didn't have any experiences,

515
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,611
 any fun, dates, no boyfriends.

516
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,681
     You know how when you
    get to be a cheerleader

517
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,550
      football players get
      to come talk to you?

518
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,721
Mm-mm,  that
     did not happen at all.

519
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,957
        If someone came
     within an inch of me,

520
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,493
    it was ridiculous, they
      would, like, pounce.

521
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,162
  - What would they do to me?

522
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,564
    - They would interrogate
       you, ask you where

523
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:24,567
      you're from, who you
    know, about your family,

524
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,037
       what you want, why
       you asked me out.

525
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,908
       I actually missed
       my sophomore prom.

526
00:43:33,345 --> 00:43:38,414
  - Yeah, this guy was asking
    me to prom, super sweet,

527
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,920
   and one of my brothers, he
 just threatens to beat him up.

528
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,658
        And, of course,
       the guy freaks out

529
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,995
       and I stay at home
         on prom night.

530
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:57,600
   Yeah, it was bad, I can't
 even tell you how many times,

531
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,036
    how many times I missed
       out on a fun date

532
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:03,940
      or hanging out with
      a fun guy, you know.

533
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:07,810
Poor little Angie, I
   never had a date.

534
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,513
- You do now.

535
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:14,117
    - I do now, with someone
       who's really nice.

536
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,585
- Thank you.

537
00:44:15,587 --> 00:44:16,919
           - Mm-hmm.

538
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,890
- Oh, I forgot my wallet,

539
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:23,226
      think we can stop by
      my house for a sec?

540
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,529
  - Um, sure, just to run in?

541
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,964
            - Yeah.

542
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,198
            - Okay.

543
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,100
       - And to show you
        something, too.

544
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,102
         - What's that?

545
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,170
         - You'll see.

546
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,472
- Okay.

547
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,678
- So, where are
       your brothers now?

548
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,946
- They're around,
      I don't really talk

549
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,082
     to 'em much, you know,
       I'm an adult now.

550
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:51,154
- I like your style, well, this
  is my living room, a big TV.

551
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:52,355
             - Hmm.

552
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,990
          - Come here.

553
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,060
        Su casa mi Tom.

554
00:44:57,962 --> 00:44:59,495
- Decorated myself.

555
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,196
         - I can tell.

556
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,097
- Yeah?

557
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:01,898
            - Yeah.

558
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,433
       - It's my targets.

559
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:04,934
- Right.

560
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:06,803
            - Yeah.

561
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,178
- Um, so, where we gonna go eat?

562
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,946
        - I'm not gonna
      take you out to eat,

563
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,848
     I just wanna fuck ya.

564
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,751
             - Mm.

565
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:38,935
     Um, holographic sound
    or toning, vocal toning.

566
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,138
       A high vibrational
    sound, I've always been

567
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,573
    a singer my entire life,

568
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,109
      but in my work just
      intuitively started

569
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,145
      using sound in order
      to help someone move

570
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,747
 blocked energy in their body,

571
00:45:50,749 --> 00:45:55,885
but using sound
      to move it through.

572
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,887
       Or to bring those
     things to the surface,

573
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:01,057
 those emotions to the surface.

574
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,680
   Calling forth for clearing
 all original thought patterns,

575
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:27,016
     belief systems, roots,
      any and all systems.

576
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:29,418
      Past or present life
      trauma or experience

577
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,922
 contributing to any imbalance,
    disharmony in your body.

578
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:36,159
     Setting the intention
   that any information that

579
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:39,595
 needs to come to consciousness
     for further clearing,

580
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,998
       transformation or
  transmutation of energy that

581
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,300
      does not serve your
      physical, emotional,

582
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,969
       mental, spiritual
     and energetic bodies.

583
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:50,206
  That is happening right now.

584
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,136
            - Whoa.

585
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,594
    - Why are you laughing?

586
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:01,230
- Remember that
       one time?

587
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,032
             - Mm.

588
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:05,334
            Nothing.

589
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,035
            - What?

590
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:06,702
           - Nothing.

591
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:07,336
        - One more time.

592
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,437
           - Nothing.

593
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,506
        We're sleeping.

594
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:51,307
       - I always enjoyed
      living on extremes,

595
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:53,175
  from one extreme to another.

596
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:58,581
   You know, this one time I
    was wasted at this hotel

597
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,053
    party in San Antonio and
   it was 4:00 in the morning

598
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:09,125
      and my buddies were
  hanging out in south Austin

599
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,962
   and I was like, "You know
    what, I'm just gonna go,

600
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,830
      "but if I don't get
      a move on I'm gonna

601
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,999
     "miss the party that's
     going on over there."

602
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:20,136
   So, I was like, "You know
     what, the best idea is

603
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:23,472
 "to do in this situation would
  be to get on the motorcycle

604
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,209
       "and get to Austin
     as soon as possible."

605
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,712
     So, that's what I did
      and I got to Austin

606
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,981
       in 25 minutes from
     downtown San Antonio.

607
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,949
- That's insane.

608
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:36,519
 - It is, it is, and I thought
   it was the best idea ever,

609
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:39,255
        just hauling 200
     miles an hour down 35.

610
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,458
   It got to the point where
    I was just passing cops

611
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,793
       on the freeway and
       I would see in the

612
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,395
    rear-view mirror they'd
      turn on their lights

613
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,931
      and, you know, maybe
    start to pursue and then

614
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,233
         after, I don't
      know, 10, 15 seconds

615
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,401
      they would just turn
       their lights off.

616
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,203
       It was like, well,
      there's a black bike

617
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,272
     just shooting down in
    the middle of the night.

618
00:52:56,274 --> 00:53:00,576
      I mean, by the time
    they knew what the fuck,

619
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,778
       you know, I was in
        the next county.

620
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:08,517
   I like that actually, when
    you're going that fast,

621
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,489
       as far in front of
      you as you can see,

622
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,491
       that's immediately
    what's in front of you.

623
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:16,926
- Mm-hmm.

624
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:19,762
   - You know and so, there's
    no processing anything,

625
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:22,164
       there's no looking
       from side to side.

626
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:26,502
     It's just you on this,
    like, really fast horse.

627
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,706
   I don't know, I mean it's
  just kinda more of the same,

628
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,975
     but I haven't written
      words to it yet, so.

629
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,143
     - It was very pretty.

630
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:35,110
         - Oh, thanks.

631
00:53:35,112 --> 00:53:37,146
      - It was kinda sad.

632
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,423
   - I don't know, what kind
     of lines do you like?

633
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,459
       Long skinny ones,
        short fat ones,

634
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,161
    big ones, small ones...

635
00:53:52,163 --> 00:53:52,795
            - Um...

636
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:53,596
           - Medium.

637
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,130
    - Medium skinny, please.

638
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,499
   - Medium skinny, alright.

639
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:11,180
    - Okay, Rodrigo, enough
  with all of the philosophy.

640
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:17,453
    Listen, I'm not judging
        you, I like you,

641
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,654
    that's why you're here.

642
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:19,788
       Why are you here?

643
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,890
   Are we gonna fuck or not?

644
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,127
    - Are we gonna fuck? No.

645
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,796
- Whoa, what are you doing here?

646
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:15,597
- Calm
   down, I just need to pee.

647
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:28,710
        How's it going?

648
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,012
            - Good.

649
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:32,381
- How was your night last night?

650
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:35,117
- Uh, it was
      alright,.

651
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,187
        - That's crazy.

652
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,456
      I got with Rodrigo.

653
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,359
After the barbecue we just went

654
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,528
   back and had a nice time.

655
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,397
         What'd you do?

656
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:50,165
     - Oh, I just hung out
    with Inez a little bit.

657
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,569
- Yeah,
    she your girlfriend now?

658
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,304
 - Uh, yeah, you can say that.

659
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,705
- That's cool.

660
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,441
        I'm gonna go to
       the studio later.

661
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,544
     Will you walk with me?

662
00:58:02,546 --> 00:58:06,381
       - Uh, sure, I told
       Inez that I would

663
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:07,816
       go over today, her
       dad's mad at her,

664
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,418
   she didn't get home until
     three in the morning--

665
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,519
- Oh.

666
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:11,954
- last night, even though my mom

667
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:13,822
   told her mom it'd be okay.

668
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,757
    Her dad doesn't like it.

669
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,526
 He's always bitching about it.

670
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,996
- Yeah,
     hey, gimme some soap.

671
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,332
           Thank you.

672
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,269
     When I was growing up
      my dad was a hippie.

673
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:29,204
He came out of a generation that

674
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,373
  truly believed in free love.

675
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:35,043
     So, instead of telling
       my not to have sex

676
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,712
 he encouraged me to have sex,

677
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:41,116
  he encouraged me to fuck as
   many boys as I wanted to.

678
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,520
  And so I did and it was fun.

679
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:49,191
  But my other friends, their
dads told them not to have sex,

680
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,995
     so then they ended up
  thinking that I was a slut.

681
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,598
And so I guess I started hanging

682
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,567
  around guys a lot more often

683
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:01,169
       because they just
    seemed less judgmental.

684
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:05,007
    - Well, a guy that fucks
   a lot of girls is a slut.

685
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,843
I don't think so.

686
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,079
  Well, let's think about it,

687
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,750
    a guy, say he tells you
    that he fucked 20 girls,

688
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,352
       and you think he's
        a player, right?

689
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,921
 You think he's a total badass.

690
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:23,492
Okay, so if a girl says that she

691
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:28,564
   fucked 10 guys then it's,
 like, you think she's a slut.

692
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,266
     - A girl that fucks a
     lot of guys is a slut.

693
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,569
  - Why can't I be the player?

694
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,437
    What's wrong with that?

695
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,406
 I'm not ready to settle down,

696
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,209
     why should I just have
   to have sex with one guy?

697
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:44,580
      And a guy who fucks
         a lot of girls

698
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,281
    is just a player, right?

699
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:47,215
             Right?

700
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,317
            - Yeah.

701
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:49,952
- Wrong.

702
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:53,055
           So wrong.

703
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:55,757
I always fall for

704
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,393
         young, sweet,
      strong Mexican boys.

705
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:01,330
       Ever since I was,
        like, 13 or so.

706
01:00:01,332 --> 01:00:04,366
      when I was 16 I had
       this one boyfriend

707
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,569
      and I loved him, he
       was so beautiful.

708
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:11,039
     He had these big puffy
   lips that I loved to kiss.

709
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:14,676
        They were pillow
     lips just like yours.

710
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:16,845
  He had these beautiful eyes,

711
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,581
     I loved him so much, I
    loved cuddling with him

712
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,817
       just as much as I
       loved fucking him.

713
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,253
      He had this younger
     brother who was, like,

714
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,255
    I don't know, just a few
     years younger than him

715
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:29,191
     and they looked almost
       exactly the same.

716
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,526
      And one day we were
        all hanging out

717
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:35,998
    and we got so stoned and
  then you know what happened?

718
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,067
 We made love, all three of us.

719
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:43,472
   Two guys and one girl all
   loving each other equally.

720
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,141
   There wasn't any jealousy,

721
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,610
    there wasn't any shame,

722
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,813
        there wasn't any
     mother to tell us no.

723
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:57,185
    We were fucking just for
  the pure joy of being alive.

724
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,855
It was the most beautiful thing.

725
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,260
     Anyways, thank God for
     young beautiful boys.

726
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,363
 Looks like you popped a boner.

727
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:09,264
             - Yup.

728
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,937
   So, you know, sex is just
 another way of communication.

729
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,907
     If people fucked more
    there would be less war.

730
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:25,313
       Less killing, less
      rape, all that shit.

731
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:26,882
     You know what I mean?

732
01:01:26,884 --> 01:01:28,717
      - Yeah, I think so.

733
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,353
         - I mean, it's
      just like if people

734
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,155
   did what they wanted to do

735
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,157
       and as long as it
      didn't hurt anyone,

736
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,459
 there shouldn't be a problem.

737
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,694
  Does that make sense to you?

738
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:40,128
            - Yeah.

739
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:45,333
Smell's important.

740
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:46,735
- Smell?

741
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,037
- Yeah,
   like the way a guy smells.

742
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,808
I hate it when guys put on Axe,

743
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,509
 you know that deodorant spray,

744
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:55,977
       don't ever use it.

745
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:59,014
- Well, some expensive
     stuff actually helps.

746
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,517
- Oh, I guess so, but you know,

747
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:04,086
       it's important to
       be able to pick up

748
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:06,221
 on other people's pheromones.

749
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:09,725
    Like, that's how we know
 we're attracted to each other.

750
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,794
        You smell good.

751
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,067
       You know anything
        about the clit?

752
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,636
        - Just what they
       say on South Park.

753
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,939
 - Alright, so, like, nothing.

754
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:27,075
 Well it's called the clitoris

755
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:31,046
       and it's actually
        the only part of

756
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,147
 the human body that's designed

757
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:36,084
         and functions
      purely for pleasure.

758
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:37,786
       Did you know that?

759
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:38,954
      - Didn't know that.

760
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:42,657
       - It's just there
        to enable a girl

761
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,494
        to come over and
      over and over again.

762
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:48,463
       So that means that
       if you can master

763
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:52,534
    the clitoris then you'll
    be, like, set for life.

764
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:56,071
I mean, you
       already look like

765
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:59,241
 fuckin' young Mick Jagger, so.

766
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,476
    Yeah, it's a good thing.

767
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,546
       You have one year
        until you're 17

768
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,415
       and you know what
       that means, right?

769
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:09,050
             - No.

770
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,720
- Age of fuckin' consent, dude.

771
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,488
And you know what I'm gonna do?

772
01:03:13,756 --> 01:03:16,391
    I'm gonna fuck you 'til
      your eyes fall out.

773
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,494
       But only if you've
       mastered the clit.

774
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:21,163
        - Alright, well,
       I guess I'll spend

775
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,697
   the next year practicing.

776
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:24,499
         - Yeah, do it.

777
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,869
- Inez is a nice girl.

778
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,204
    I know I can trust her.

779
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,106
- Oh, yeah, why?

780
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,876
  - Well, 'cause she's nothing
  like anyone you can't trust.

781
01:03:34,878 --> 01:03:38,013
      Like, I was at this
       party and I walked

782
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:40,415
 in on Ursa giving Robert a BJ

783
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,784
       and then she went
      into the living room

784
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:45,420
     and started making out
   with her boyfriend Carlos.

785
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,255
I mean, that's just disgusting.

786
01:03:47,257 --> 01:03:49,424
       - Right, and your
        sweet angel Inez

787
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:50,959
  would never do that, right?

788
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,427
      - I don't think so.

789
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:54,062
- Well, what's so
   gross about that anyways?

790
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,530
        I mean, really.

791
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:57,799
       - I mean, she has
        Robert's splooge

792
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:01,236
 in her mouth and then she goes

793
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:02,938
   and makes out with Carlos.

794
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,539
I mean, that'd be like if Carlos

795
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:07,742
   gave Robert a BJ, it's the
    same thing pretty much.

796
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,680
       - So what, man, I
       mean, think about,

797
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:15,483
      like, say some dude
    goes and fucks some girl

798
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:16,818
     and then he goes home,

799
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,554
        goes home to his
    girlfriend and his angel

800
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,156
 and she's just there waiting.

801
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,824
        She's, like, so
       stoked to see him,

802
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:24,326
        she just, like,
       rips off his pants

803
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,228
     and immediately starts
     giving him a blow job.

804
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,996
       Well, guess what?
        His dick was in

805
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:31,032
   some other girl's vagina,
    like, two hours earlier.

806
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,402
        So now her mouth
       all over his dick

807
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:37,072
 with the vagina and it's just,

808
01:04:37,074 --> 01:04:40,942
  they go have sex after that
 and it's like the same thing.

809
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,611
  And it happens all the time.

810
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,547
  - Yeah, well, I don't know,

811
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:47,816
        I just don't see
        how a girl would

812
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:49,618
         be able to do
      something like that.

813
01:04:49,852 --> 01:04:51,486
        If Inez ever did
      something like that

814
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,989
    to me I'd probably never
    have another girlfriend.

815
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:57,726
       - Whatever, well,
      sucks for you then.

816
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,633
     If you don't want Inez
     to fool around on you,

817
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:06,268
       you know what you
        gotta do, right?

818
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,469
- No.

819
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:08,970
      - You gotta eat some
      fuckin' pussy, man.

820
01:05:08,972 --> 01:05:11,640
        You get good at
       eatin' pussy then

821
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:15,277
    she'll like never have a
 reason to fool around on you.

822
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:18,680
      - I've never looked
       at it in that way.

823
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,615
     - Yeah, you gotta put
   some effort in, you know?

824
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,217
            - Yeah.

825
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,686
    It is only for pleasure,

826
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,222
        that's all I can
      remember right now.

827
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:28,857
        It's, like, when
       you're down there

828
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:32,360
     eating, you know, Inez
     or whatever girl out,

829
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:34,496
       don't be afraid to
       ask her, you know.

830
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,464
         Like, what she
      likes, 'cause if you

831
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:38,133
      don't ask and if she
       doesn't tell you,

832
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,035
      how the fuck are you
     gonna know what to do?

833
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:43,438
     This one time this guy
      was going down on me

834
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,607
        and he was like
       going crazy and it

835
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,175
        just, like, felt
     awful and I was like,

836
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:48,310
        "What the fuck?"

837
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:49,477
      And I, like, looked
        up and it looked

838
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,646
       like he was, like,
    chowing down like a dog.

839
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:53,949
      Like chowing down on
      a bowl of dog food.

840
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,216
    And I was like, "Dude!"

841
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,552
    I was like, "My pussy's
    not a bowl of dog food."

842
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,454
     And he, like, his head
    shot up and he was like,

843
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,722
       "Oh, shit, sorry."

844
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,057
 And I was like, "Yeah, dude."

845
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,626
      And I, like, talked
         him through it

846
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,361
       and we figured it
        out and it was,

847
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,364
 just like, funny and fun, so,

848
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,766
   not a big deal, you know?

849
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:12,901
      But it's important.

850
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:14,903
        - Well, my uncle
        says that, like,

851
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:17,072
for him it's like the best thing

852
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18,840
   in the world, he loves it.

853
01:06:18,842 --> 01:06:20,709
      He loves the smell,
      he loves the taste.

854
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:21,643
           - Uh-huh.

855
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,645
 - Like, I guess for some girls

856
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,915
      take a long to come,
       he said it's like

857
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:29,784
   pushing a bowling ball up
    a hill with his tongue.

858
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,530
       - Hey, do a trick.

859
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:43,398
       - You do a trick.

860
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,299
   - What's your best trick?

861
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,401
       You're the skater.

862
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:48,370
  - Skate towards me at least.

863
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,407
- Does it
   matter which way it goes?

864
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:53,775
- Not really.

865
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,710
- I'm scared.

866
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:58,880
        Oh, it's bumpy!

867
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,209
         - What are you
      guys doing in here?

868
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,178
- I don't
 know, we're just hanging out.

869
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,847
      I'm an artist here,
     I'm doing a residency

870
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:35,784
 at, you know, Chinati and I'm

871
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,652
 just checking out this space,

872
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,888
     see if I could use it
     in some way, you know.

873
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,023
       Be like some large
        scale paintings,

874
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,758
       maybe even have a
       show or something.

875
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,559
- Yeah.

876
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,693
- Yeah.

877
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,195
- I'm gonna go to Inez's.

878
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,030
Alright.

879
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,832
           Bye, Adam.

880
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:55,703
       - So, do you have
   permission to be in here?

881
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,971
         - Yes, I have
     permission to be here.

882
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,039
- From who?

883
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,441
 - From the Chinati Foundation.

884
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,608
- Hm.

885
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,810
    - Who I guess you could
       say is my employer

886
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,411
       because I'm doing
       a residency there.

887
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,947
- So, if you're an
artist, where's all your paint?

888
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,982
        - At my studio.

889
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:09,584
    What are you doing here?

890
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,553
       - What do you mean
    what are we doing here?

891
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:12,854
 What is that supposed to mean?

892
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,289
    - This isn't the border.

893
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,159
         - Yeah, right.

894
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,596
- I mean,
   y'all are Hispanic, right?

895
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,566
Yeah, I'm Dominican.

896
01:08:24,568 --> 01:08:26,634
  - What, wait, what does that
   have to do with anything?

897
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:30,238
- How does
     it feel to work a job

898
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,641
  where you're job is to bust
  your own people essentially.

899
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:35,777
   How do you sleep at night?

900
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,980
   - Who the hell are you to
  ask me a question like that?

901
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,149
         You don't know
       anything about me.

902
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,618
       You don't know one
        thing about me.

903
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,553
         - I guess not.

904
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:46,654
- You wouldn't get it,

905
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,289
         not from where
      you're coming from.

906
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:54,229
     Some white privileged
     girl from the suburbs

907
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:57,332
      who's had everything
         handed to her.

908
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:02,403
Who works for an art foundation
    drawing little pictures.

909
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,507
    No, you wouldn't get it.

910
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:06,708
- - To you

911
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,543
- that's a
      job, gimme a second.

912
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,378
      To you that's a job.

913
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,813
Yeah, that's my job,

914
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,349
- Yeah, wow,
      what responsibility.

915
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:17,519
       You got a family?

916
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:20,388
You got any kids? Sick mom? Huh?

917
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,023
Dad in jail? Anything like that?

918
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:23,224
             - No.

919
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:26,528
- So you have
      no idea why I do it.

920
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,265
      Do you know how many
      of you artists come

921
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:32,333
     through here flipping
        your nose at us

922
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,404
    because we have to do a
   job to feed out children?

923
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,373
You choose the job.

924
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,976
    - I do? Look around you,
there's nothing to choose here.

925
01:09:41,978 --> 01:09:44,479
      What am I gonna do,
      work at Dairy Queen?

926
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:49,551
- Sorry, man,
 but this is really just a job.

927
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,820
Border patrol is pretty much the

928
01:09:52,822 --> 01:09:54,088
 only thing was gonna hire me.

929
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,626
        So, that's that.

930
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:02,030
       - Do you have any
    illegals in your family?

931
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,566
- Most of
   my family are immigrants.

932
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:08,069
    Actually my grandfather
         was the first

933
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:11,272
 one to come over, like, 1965.

934
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,775
   He was a businessman over
there and like, well respected.

935
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,176
           - Mm-hmm.

936
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,611
- He
   even tried to help against

937
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:19,147
        Trujillo who was
     dictator at the time.

938
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,582
- Whoa.

939
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:22,550
       - But, uh, when it
      got to be too rough

940
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,152
 he knew it was time to leave.

941
01:10:24,154 --> 01:10:25,119
- Mm-hmm.

942
01:10:25,121 --> 01:10:26,588
   - And came to the States.

943
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,789
- Mm-hmm.

944
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,791
       - And I know what
       you're getting it,

945
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,760
     it's just I have a lot
      of respect for him.

946
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:33,695
         Even though--

947
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:34,829
- For sure, yeah.

948
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,864
        - you know, he's
      an immigrant and...

949
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,002
- What
      about you? I mean--

950
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,470
        - What about me?

951
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:45,106
- Do you have
  any illegals in your family?

952
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,612
- What the hell
     is that in your hand?

953
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,280
- What?

954
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:54,616
     - You know I can bust
      your ass right now.

955
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:59,387
- Why? Why
       would you do that?

956
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,489
      Do ya'll smoke weed?

957
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:02,523
- No,
       I don't want any,

958
01:11:02,525 --> 01:11:03,725
 get that shit out of my face.

959
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:06,194
- Okay,
        okay, I'm sorry.

960
01:11:06,196 --> 01:11:07,929
     I'll just, I'll smoke
     it over here, alright?

961
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,797
- Yeah,
      we can't smoke weed.

962
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:10,965
- Oh, really?

963
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,066
   - Yeah, they drug test us.

964
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,502
   - Young woman] Oh, I see.

965
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:15,670
         - Smells good.

966
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,507
- Well,
       like, what kind of

967
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,109
stuff shows up in the drug test?

968
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:22,243
         - Everything.

969
01:11:22,245 --> 01:11:23,611
- Everything?

970
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,879
            Cocaine?

971
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:25,680
             - Yep.

972
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:26,481
- Yeah.

973
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:29,083
    - What about mushrooms?

974
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,886
     - What are they like?

975
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,389
       - Afternoon, Mary.

976
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:09,791
- Hey, Tom.

977
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,259
         - How are you?

978
01:12:11,261 --> 01:12:12,627
- Alright.

979
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:13,995
            - Good.

980
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,697
          How's Adam?

981
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,866
- Adam's fine, you were a little

982
01:12:18,868 --> 01:12:20,601
rough with him the other night.

983
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:24,238
     - I know, I apologize,
       he shouldn't have
      ran from me though.

984
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,909
     He could have been an
  illegal or there's Al Qaeda.

985
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,481
      - He's a 16 year old
      kid from this town.

986
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:37,652
     - You know, I realize
   your husband's not around,

987
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,189
      16 is the prime age
      for sexual activity.

988
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,825
   This is what's out there.

989
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,368
- Why you showing her that shit?

990
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:54,635
         - Hey, Chachi.

991
01:12:54,637 --> 01:12:55,570
- You can go play with your toy.

992
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:56,738
 - Hey, you can't fuck with me.

993
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,039
- Chachi.
-        - I'm 19,

994
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,240
- I can
      stay out all night.

995
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:00,074
- Chachi,
       it's alright, man.

996
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,542
    It's okay, it's alright.

997
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:06,314
  - I'll take off, I know when
   I'm not welcome, I'll go.

998
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,868
- Maybe you
     can skate with someone

999
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,169
like, on the back of your board.

1000
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,470
- Like two people?

1001
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:30,705
- Just like this.

1002
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,640
- Probably
        going downhill.

1003
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,108
- Downhill?

1004
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,978
- Yeah, probably be
 the only way that would work.

1005
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,536
     - So, how long is your
    dad gonna be pissed for?

1006
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,072
      - He'll get over it.

1007
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,177
    - I gotta go, love you.

1008
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,046
        - Love you, too.

1009
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,680
        - You got a hot
       little girlfriend.

1010
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,517
     You eatin' that pussy?

1011
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,319
    That's some table stuff,

1012
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,954
   I'd lay her on the table,

1013
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:30,324
  I'd spread her legs, I'd get
  my whole face down in there.

1014
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:05,359
       - Want me to teach
         you something?

1015
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:07,695
     - I don't know, what?

1016
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:14,302
        - The woman, she
      always comes first.

1017
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,745
  - I wanna move to San Diego.

1018
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:28,282
       I wanna be a actor
        when I grow up.

1019
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:33,120
    If I grow up, if Miguel
    doesn't fuckin' kill me.

1020
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,868
    - It's true, everybody's
      probably gonna find
        out about this.

1021
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,671
- Yeah.

1022
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,179
            - But...

1023
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:07,321
      we have this moment
   right now or nobody does.

1024
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,358
- Yeah, I mean,
     you can't do anything

1025
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:15,029
      in this town without
   everyone knowing about it.

1026
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,667
   Like, when I first started
      smoking weed it was,

1027
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:23,270
      like, two days later
       and everybody was
      asking me about it.

1028
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,406
           - Really?

1029
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:27,942
 - Yeah, it was, it was stupid.

1030
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,413
       And I didn't even
       smoke with anyone.

1031
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,016
  I was pretty much by myself

1032
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,186
        and people still
      found out about it.

1033
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,355
     Just I don't know how.

1034
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:23,364
  - No, can't have this, dude.

1035
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,192
- Bye.

1036
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:58,399
       - You want a beer?

1037
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,234
- Yeah,
        I'd love a beer.

1038
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,035
           - Cheers.

1039
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,470
           - Cheers.

1040
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:08,309
        - Tastes great.

1041
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:15,483
So, I mean, what's Oscar's deal?

1042
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:22,056
     - Well, Border Patrol,
        he's my roommate

1043
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:25,993
      and a coconut and...

1044
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,930
       What's a coconut?

1045
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:33,567
- It's something the locals call

1046
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:36,170
      BP's that are Latin,

1047
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:40,441
   he's brown on the outside
    and white on the inside.

1048
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:44,178
       - Like, he has no
      love for his people,

1049
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,080
he has no problem with his job.

1050
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,083
 - I mean, he seems to love it.

1051
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:49,984
           - Really?

1052
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:53,020
   - Yeah, we have, you know,

1053
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,722
 we have another roommate, too.

1054
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:57,525
        His name's Tom,
       he's a white guy,

1055
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:59,960
     he has a goatee, might
      see him around town.

1056
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,530
   But we all live together.

1057
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,667
      Well, I got, I don't
      know, I got a bunch

1058
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:09,603
of that hard charging out of me.

1059
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,673
 I was in the Army for 8 years.

1060
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:15,810
        My first tour, I
      went to Iraq twice,

1061
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:18,145
  and my first tour, you know,

1062
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:22,449
  I was like, I was kinda like
    Oscar and Tom, you know.

1063
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,586
  But when you see what, like,

1064
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:29,723
    people really go through
      and it's, you know,

1065
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,992
      it's a lot different
       than in the media.

1066
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:37,698
At first I hated 'em, you know,

1067
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,333
I listened to all the propaganda

1068
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:43,204
   and, you know, everybody's
       bad that's there.

1069
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:48,275
      And then the more I
      was there I ended up

1070
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:54,448
        being in charge
       of the detainees.

1071
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,652
     Like, the people that
       we arrested that,

1072
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:01,655
         you know, were
    insurgents or whatever.

1073
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,859
       When I took a look
       at 'em, you know,

1074
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,661
          they weren't
      dressed in uniforms,

1075
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,330
 they didn't have any weapons,

1076
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:11,866
     they were just people.

1077
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:14,201
   I was just, I don't know,

1078
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,303
      I just thought I was
      gonna die every day

1079
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:19,640
       'cause my platoon
      sergeant at the time

1080
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:24,712
    she volunteered me to be
    the lead 50 cal gunner.

1081
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:29,316
       We were all truck
       drivers and going

1082
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:32,353
         on convoys and
      stuff so right when

1083
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:33,153
  she told me that I was like,

1084
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:34,121
     "Well, I'm gonna die."

1085
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,590
  And I really believed that,

1086
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:41,328
     so the whole time that
     we were home training

1087
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:44,765
  I worked hard, partied hard,

1088
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:48,302
     and that's why I have
       all these tattoos.

1089
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,339
        I just, I don't
      know, like I really

1090
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:54,341
      thought I was gonna
       die so I got like

1091
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:57,778
       my mom and that's
     like the middle of the

1092
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:01,548
     Dominican flag and has
      my family around it.

1093
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,618
- Who's this?

1094
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,753
 - That's about my grandfather
     that I told you about.

1095
01:22:05,755 --> 01:22:07,488
     It has to do with him,

1096
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,357
he was, like, really sick and we

1097
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,026
thought we were gonna lose him.

1098
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:15,763
       And I thought that
       while I was there

1099
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:20,100
     that he was gonna die
       and so I was like,

1100
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,137
     I'll get this to kind
      of commemorate him.

1101
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,205
       It represents with
       death comes life.

1102
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:28,175
        This arm is all,
       have you heard of

1103
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:28,842
  the book Lord of the Flies?

1104
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:29,777
           - Mm-hmm.

1105
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:31,312
- Yeah, that's what this one is,

1106
01:22:31,314 --> 01:22:32,780
            it's a--

1107
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:34,214
    - Oh, yeah, let me see.

1108
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:36,617
  - Yeah, look, has the conch,

1109
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,919
     has the kids crashing,
      the plane crashing.

1110
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:43,357
 The little kids, that's why I
  got survival of the fittest.

1111
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,977
      - I think that sick
   fuck's been breaking into

1112
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,879
      people's houses and
     jerking off and shit.

1113
01:24:11,881 --> 01:24:12,880
            - Uh-uh.

1114
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,249
That's fuckin' disgusting, man.

1115
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,550
   Hey, I'll catch you later.

1116
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,585
     Why don't you go jack
      off in some houses.

1117
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,587
- You got.

1118
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:26,727
   - Adam, hi, so you passed.

1119
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,328
   - Yeah, I'm a Junior now.

1120
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:30,731
     I just wanna graduate
    and get outta this town.

1121
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,233
           How's she?

1122
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:36,603
      - Any day now, we'll
       see ya next year.

1123
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:37,905
- Alright.
             - Bye.

1124
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:38,906
- Bye.

1125
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,656
    - Come here, come here.

1126
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:33,680
- Hey, man, hey, hey, hey, man!

1127
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,749
   You're fuckin' up my shit!

1128
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,432
         - He likes it.

1129
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:55,535
     - Fuck you, you spic.

1130
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:58,071
  - I'm gonna make him go DF.

1131
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,449
  - I gotta go to work, fuck.

1132
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,319
  I got a fuckin' night shift.

1133
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:27,701
- Inez said that she missed her

1134
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:31,238
         period and she
       might be pregnant.

1135
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:43,650
- I am pregnant.

1136
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,253
            - What?

1137
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:06,039
       - Ma, ma, ma, ma,
        ma, ma, ma, ma.

1138
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,344
  Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

1139
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:12,746
      Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

1140
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,584
- I'm sorry you had to see that.

1141
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:23,023
     You don't really, uh,
      know how I grew up.

1142
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:27,194
 My dad beat the fuck outta me.

1143
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,697
    It started with lighter
   burns and cigarette burns

1144
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:33,867
     and then it graduated
        to closed fists.

1145
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:37,137
     I don't even remember
        doing anything,

1146
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,840
    I think he just liked to
   do it, he liked the pain.

1147
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:42,743
    That equaled love to me,

1148
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:47,481
 so I played football and I was

1149
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:49,716
 the skinniest guy on the team

1150
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:53,186
        and I could take
       the fuckin' hits.

1151
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,189
     I owe that to my dad,
     he created a monster.

1152
01:29:57,024 --> 01:30:00,460
 That's why everyone loved me,
   I was all-state two years.

1153
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:05,165
 I was trying to make him proud

1154
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,867
       and it seemed like
       the more I got hit

1155
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:09,903
      the more he cheered,
      the more he cheered.

1156
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,974
      I remember the first
      time I dropped back

1157
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:19,045
   for a pass and it was, and
    I sat back in the pocket

1158
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,851
       and I coulda threw
     it, I coulda threw it,

1159
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:28,121
      but I knew that this
   fuckin' cocksucker across

1160
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:30,791
    here was gonna come and
      he was gonna hit me.

1161
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,560
   And I waited just seconds,

1162
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:36,463
 'cause I wanted him to hit me.

1163
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:38,598
  So I stopped, I dropped back

1164
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,536
       and I got cracked
        so fuckin' hard.

1165
01:30:44,705 --> 01:30:46,406
       Well, first I saw
      everyone else, like,

1166
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:51,411
  you know, concerned for me.

1167
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,981
     Except my dad, he was
     the only one standing

1168
01:30:54,983 --> 01:30:56,716
   and he was cheering like,

1169
01:30:56,718 --> 01:30:59,119
    "Yeah, get up, get up!"

1170
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:04,925
      And then I realized
    that I got an erection.

1171
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,895
       And it was weird.

1172
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:15,001
    It was the first time in
    my life I felt intimacy.

1173
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:20,407
    I felt like I just made
      my dad proud of me.

1174
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,083
       And so whenever I
      played from then on,

1175
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:32,819
       it was like that's
      what I strived for.

1176
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,589
 I strived for that attention,

1177
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:38,091
I wasn't even playing the sport

1178
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:43,763
    to play the sport, I was
    playing it for the pain.

1179
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:49,836
And now I'm a father and I have

1180
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,639
        a nine year old
       son and my fucking

1181
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:55,742
 ex-wife took him away from me

1182
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,944
   and I didn't do anything.

1183
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:02,582
     I love my son, I would
      never discipline him

1184
01:32:02,584 --> 01:32:05,018
       the way my father
        disciplined me.

1185
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:07,821
  I would never use my fists,

1186
01:32:07,823 --> 01:32:09,956
   these hands are for love.

1187
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:12,392
   A strap is for discipline.

1188
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,266
        I just miss him.

1189
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:28,575
- Did you
      circumcise your son?

1190
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:34,281
            - Yeah.

1191
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:36,082
   - And when you cut it off,

1192
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:39,886
       you lose like 50%
        of your feeling.

1193
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:43,623
      It's like, it's like
    it's there for pleasure.

1194
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:44,891
It's like the clit or something

1195
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:47,594
        and you fuckin'
      mutilate your kids.

1196
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,464
That's why I only fuck Latinos,

1197
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:55,368
     'cause they know what
      pleasure feels like.

1198
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,304
  They know how to make love,

1199
01:32:57,306 --> 01:32:59,539
it's like they can feel things.

1200
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,044
       'Cause they're not
      missing that sheath.

1201
01:33:04,046 --> 01:33:06,379
     It's like nature, all
     animals have sheaths.

1202
01:33:06,381 --> 01:33:09,449
       They can come over
         and over again

1203
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:11,451
      and they don't have
       to just jackhammer

1204
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:13,787
 the girl away into the night.

1205
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:16,790
And funny, I mean you fuckin'--

1206
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:32,298
          - Hey, Adam.

1207
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:35,335
        Hey, man, you're
       past curfew again.

1208
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:38,371
       I'll run you home.

1209
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,688
  I know your mother likes me.

1210
01:34:56,824 --> 01:34:59,926
 It may not seem like it, she's
   just playing hard to get.

1211
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:16,943
  I know she wants to fuck me.

1212
01:35:19,413 --> 01:35:21,448
     Oh, what we got here?

1213
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:23,316
          We got here?

1214
01:35:23,784 --> 01:35:25,819
         That's a bust.

1215
01:36:03,624 --> 01:36:05,191
- Where are we going?

1216
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,429
      You missed the turn.

1217
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:11,498
       - I suppose I did.

1218
01:36:36,090 --> 01:36:37,490
- What the
      fuck are you doing?

1219
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:38,424
- Shut up.

1220
01:36:38,426 --> 01:36:39,192
- Get the fuck off me.

1221
01:36:39,194 --> 01:36:40,860
- Shut up.

1222
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:42,061
- Fuck you!

1223
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:43,463
- Just be quiet.

1224
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:46,199
- Fuck you, why
   the fuck would I be quiet?

1225
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:47,634
      Get the fuck off me!

1226
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:48,902
- Shut up!

1227
01:36:48,904 --> 01:36:50,670
- Psycho motherfucker.

1228
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:53,973
Fuckin'.

1229
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,141
- Come here.

1230
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:56,643
- What the fuck's
       a matter with you!

1231
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:00,680
        - Fuckin' doing!

1232
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:01,881
        - You have a hot
       little girlfriend.

1233
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:05,351
        - What the fuck,
      crazy motherfucker.

1234
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:07,520
      get the fuck off me!

1235
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,622
  What the fuck are you doing?

1236
01:37:09,624 --> 01:37:11,224
- Your peter
       tastes like pussy.

1237
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,262
     Come on, get it up, I
     want your hate paste.

1238
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:22,735
        - Fuckin' crazy
     motherfucker! Fuckin'!

1239
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:28,508
  - You're lucky, palsy-walsy,

1240
01:37:28,909 --> 01:37:31,845
     last time I cortled a
    nigger he hung himself.

1241
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:05,738
- Adam?
