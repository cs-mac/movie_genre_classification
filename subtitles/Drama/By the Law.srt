00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,233
Hi, it's Charlie.
Leave a message.

3
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:36,411
Hi, Charlie. It's Carol
from the LA Temp Agency.

4
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,059
Listen, Dr. Batel's office needs you
for tomorrow. Is that okay?

5
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,396
Let me know. Bye.

6
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,431
Good morning, neighbor.

7
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:47,065
Hey.
Help yourself.

8
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,507
Oh, thanks.
I was out of everything.

9
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:50,044
Aw, why do I even bother?

10
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,603
You know, Remy, I gave you
that key for emergencies.

11
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:54,267
Extreme emergencies.

12
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,084
It was.
I needed caffeine.

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,963
I don't know.
This is good. I'd even wear it.

14
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:02,460
Good, 'cause I've got to go.
I'm late for my first client.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,411
But you stay,
have breakfast, take a shower.

16
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:06,511
Go through my drawers.

17
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:19,389
Hey, Charlie.
- Morning.

18
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,398
Are the boys ready?
- Dragon! Zorro!

19
00:02:23,584 --> 00:02:25,722
Hey!
There are my boys.

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,181
Come on. Yay.

21
00:02:28,223 --> 00:02:30,108
See you later!
- Bye!

22
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,437
Be good, boys!
- Whoa! Slow down!

23
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:43,228
'Romance is in the air today.

24
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,578
No one can resist your obvious charms.'

25
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,537
Well, Otis, your horoscope seems accurate.

26
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,211
Stop it.
Come on.

27
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,318
Let's read mine.
Okay.

28
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,556
'Do not leave your house today.' Too late.

29
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:03,501
'And stop looking so hard.
Love is right in front of you.'

30
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:06,392
Hey.
What's wrong?

31
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,435
I ordered a nonfat latte.
I can taste the fat.

32
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,132
I would be happy to change it for you, sir.

33
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,308
Can't you even make a friggin' cup
of coffee? I can taste the fat.

34
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:39,836
How hard it is to make
a friggin' cup of coffee?

35
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,627
I can make another one
for you if you'd like. I'd be happy...

36
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,643
to exchange it for you, sir.
- Hello? It's okay.

37
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:47,058
You've done enough, thanks.
- I'm sorry.

38
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,655
Karma.

39
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,931
Have a good one.
- Thanks, girl!

40
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:59,130
Oh, sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

41
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,303
Hi.

42
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,544
Hi.

43
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,795
I don't know how to read tarot cards.

44
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,067
Why am I in the cards?
- Come on, just try.

45
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,947
Okay, well, this crazy old lady
keeps coming up.

46
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,698
The knight in shining armor.

47
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,715
Mmm! That's mine.
- No no no. What?

48
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,275
I saw this guy twice today.
- That guy?

49
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,291
Two times in one day.
That's got to be a sign, right?

50
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,148
Mm, a sign.

51
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:32,123
Yeah, okay. What did he say
when you talked to him?

52
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,525
I didn't talk to him.

53
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,483
Well, are you sure he saw you?

54
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,812
Yeah!
I mean, I think so.

55
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,667
Okay, honey,
we're worried about you...

56
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,587
because you're turning
into a little bit of a freak.

57
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,052
Yeah, we think it's from not having sex.

58
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:51,675
Exactly.
- Look, just because...

59
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,595
I haven't been in a relationship in a while...

60
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:55,420
doesn't mean I'm miserable.

61
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,040
I just want a sweet guy,

62
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,821
you know, a guy who's strong but still...

63
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:04,155
...opens a door once in a while.

64
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:07,103
And who notices things and...

65
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:10,551
you know, maybe makes a difference.

66
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:14,901
Maybe he completes you.

67
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:17,148
Oh.

68
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:19,419
You complete me.

69
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,587
Oh, sorry.

70
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:26,746
Dr. Batel's office.
Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.

71
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,603
Go to Grandma's, tell her I'll be home late.

72
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,100
I still have stitches to do...
- Yeah, can you please hold?

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,635
I'll see you at home.

74
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:34,684
You know what? You go ahead.
I can do that for you.

75
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,691
Oh thank you, Charlie. You're a doll.
- No problem.

76
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,675
Hey, George.

77
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,691
How're you doing, Charlie?
- Good.

78
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,580
What do you got there?
- The doctor asked me...

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
to bring it from home.

80
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,894
Whew! Okay!

81
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:52,753
All right. The doctor will be right with you.

82
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:09,051
Thank you.
- # Come on, dive into the stove... #

83
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,671
We're here!

84
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,179
Thank God you guys are here.

85
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,939
I am down two girls tonight. Here.

86
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,859
Sorry, that's all I got left.
- Sweet.

87
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,447
Wow. You know, I love that I am...

88
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,443
now comfortable enough
with my sexuality...

89
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,587
to wear something like this, you know?
- Looks good on you.

90
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:24,187
Hey, what's up?
- Take off the apron now.

91
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,947
Sorry.
- Where do we start?

92
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,667
Okay, uh, hand out these shrimp balls.

93
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,747
There has got to be
a better name for those.

94
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:36,542
I don't think it's that bad of a name.
- What's wrong with the name?

95
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,251
Oh my God, that's him.
- Whoa! Who? Who?

96
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,595
The guy I ran into.
He's here.

97
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,452
Where?
- What?

98
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:45,435
That is three times in two days.
What are the chances of that?

99
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,027
Um, like, none.
- That's Dr. Fields.

100
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:50,299
This is his party. He just moved
back from San Francisco.

101
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,740
Really?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,557
Well, you're right.
He is hot.

103
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:28,891
The guy then goes into cardiac arrest,

104
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,541
Kevin performs CPR on the guy,

105
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,918
saves his life again.

106
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,504
God.
Disgusting, isn't he?

107
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:40,373
No, you are amazing.

108
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,415
Yeah.

109
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,015
Excuse me?

110
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,579
W- wait wait wait.
What do we have there?

111
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,850
Oh, um, balls.

112
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,959
Uh, shrimp balls.

113
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,171
Um, shrimp in...

114
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,574
...balls.

115
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:02,267
I'm sorry,

116
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,852
but we're not really into fish genitalia.

117
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,635
Yeah, okay.

118
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,363
Was she really listening
to our conversation?

119
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:12,463
Excuse me.

120
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,574
Wait a second.

121
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:19,355
Um, so I know two things
about you... you work in catering,

122
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,243
and you have a lot of dogs.

123
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:23,415
Oh, that... no.

124
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:24,923
Uh, I'm a dog walker.

125
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,835
I'm not some crazy dog-lady
with 12,000 dogs.

126
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:30,395
That's why.
- And I'm sorry about before.

127
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,315
I didn't mean to be eavesdropping.

128
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,915
Well, you're right.
You shouldn't have.

129
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,923
You should have stayed and talked to me.

130
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:39,387
Well, your girlfriend
seemed pretty offended.

131
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,755
Oh no, that's...
that's not my girlfriend.

132
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,675
I- I don't have a...
I'm sing...

133
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,755
I don't have a girlfriend.

134
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:47,643
What?

135
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,595
Nothing.

136
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,859
Nothing. Um, I'm Charlie.
Charlotte, but Charlie.

137
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,097
Well, I'm... I'm Kevin.

138
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,627
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

139
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,182
Uh-oh.

140
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:03,998
What? What does 'uh-oh' mean?

141
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:06,139
It looks like someone else
is mowing your lawn, Fiona.

142
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,534
I'm gonna go destroy these.

143
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,611
Excuse me.
I'll see you guys.

144
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,076
Oh, my shoes are killing me...

145
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,019
which means they must look fabulous.

146
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,705
Can I get you anything?

147
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,493
One of him on a platter.

148
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:32,187
Such a waste.

149
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,075
What's a waste?

150
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:36,663
Oh, you didn't know?

151
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:39,551
Kevin's gay.

152
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,551
What?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,219
That's Kit, the groom.

154
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,651
Or maybe he's the bride.
I can't remember...

155
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,371
which one's the top
and which one's the bottom.

156
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:53,891
Yeah, they're getting married
next Christmas in Maui.

157
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,891
I didn't get that vibe.

158
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:58,927
Trust me.

159
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,767
Thanks.

160
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,332
Look at that dude's arms!

161
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:11,071
I used to have such good gaydar.

162
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,315
Oh, you're home.
Thank God.

163
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,677
I'm exhausted.
- What did you do today?

164
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:42,427
Hi, it's Charlie. Leave a message.
- Went to the post office.

165
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,251
Uh, hi, Charlie.

166
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,043
This is Kevin Fields.
- That's him.

167
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,859
I don't know if you remember me
from the party the other night,

168
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,472
but I was just calling,
uh, to see if, um,

169
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,515
maybe... maybe you wanted
to walk my dog.

170
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,051
What? No!

171
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,779
Hang up the phone.

172
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,691
No, actually, you can't,
because I don't have a dog.

173
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,541
So maybe you could walk me.

174
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:09,530
Hang it up.

175
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,450
All right, you know,
I'm-I'm gonna go now.

176
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,511
Call me at 555-0118 and ask for Dr. Fields.

177
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,371
Okay, thanks. Bye.

178
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,675
Oh man, that was...
that was horrible.

179
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:22,331
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath
for a callback on that.

180
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,763
Yeah, she'll call me back
if she wants to walk an idiot.

181
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:28,348
Yeah, I'm not going to disagree with you.

182
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,652
So takeout or raid your fridge?

183
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,384
Here we go.

184
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:42,522
Take it easy, Lilly.

185
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,559
Easy.

186
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:52,635
Hi.

187
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:55,899
You never called me back so I figured
I would bring the coffee to you.

188
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:58,170
Thanks.

189
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:01,563
Um, look, I think you're
a really nice guy and everything,

190
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,835
but I don't know why you called me.

191
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,627
Hmm?
- I'm a woman.

192
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,865
Yeah, I love that fact.

193
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,543
Have you ever been with a woman?

194
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,131
Excuse me?

195
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,499
I mean, have you only ever been with men?

196
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,035
Men?
What are you talking...

197
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,019
whoa whoa whoa.
Wait a minute, I'm not gay.

198
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,323
You're not?
- No.

199
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:26,267
No, I like women.
Lots of... no, not lots of women,

200
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,898
but you know what I mean.

201
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:30,378
Why did you think I was gay?

202
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,539
Awkward.

203
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,061
Okay, I got to go now.

204
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,986
Wait wait.
Wait wait wait.

205
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,066
Okay, I'll prove to you that I'm not gay.

206
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,883
Let me take you out on Friday night.
We'll watch the playoffs,

207
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:45,115
I'll order a pizza,
I'll completely ignore you.

208
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,703
Give me one good reason.

209
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:50,682
'Cause I'm different.

210
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:53,335
Really?

211
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,840
Okay, what color are my eyes?

212
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,347
Well, at first glance,
your eyes are brown.

213
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,866
But when the light hits them
they change to amber.

214
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:09,019
And if you look really closely around the
iris the color is pure honey.

215
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,546
But when you look into the sun...

216
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,948
they almost look green.

217
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,982
That's my favorite.

218
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,932
How did I do?

219
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,553
I would've settled for brown.

220
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:30,071
Okay!
- Peanut, let go!

221
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,131
Off! Off!

222
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,784
I'm sorry he bit you.

223
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,123
I mean, they all have their shots
so it should be fine.

224
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:38,779
Seriously, don't worry about it.
It barely broke the skin.

225
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,795
Outside.
- Did you just move in or something?

226
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,163
No, I've been here a year and a half.

227
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:44,827
Oh, nice place.

228
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:48,123
I should have some hydrogen peroxide
around here somewhere.

229
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:49,723
What is all this stuff?

230
00:13:49,823 --> 00:13:51,770
Oh, I'm a yoga instructor.

231
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,011
This?
- And a Little League coach.

232
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,643
And a dog walker and a caterer.

233
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:57,563
I told you I'm a temp.

234
00:13:57,663 --> 00:14:00,027
That is not true.
She is an incredibly talented artist.

235
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:02,299
Remy! Remy!
- I mean, look at her sketchbook.

236
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,867
She hides it right under there.
- Remy!

237
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,007
What?

238
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,486
He's not...

239
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,649
Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

240
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,603
Found it!

241
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:21,882
So you're an artist, too?

242
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:25,947
Uh, I like to dabble
in a lot of different things.

243
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,858
I mean, life's too short
to live the same day twice, right?

244
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,843
Yeah. That's a good philosophy to live by.

245
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:33,050
My dad always used to say that. Come on.

246
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,703
Used to?
- Oh, yeah,

247
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:38,043
my parents died when I was little.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

248
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,411
That's okay.
It was a really long time ago.

249
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,427
You ready?
- Yeah... I mean,

250
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,378
it's a little embarrassing.
I'm the doctor.

251
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:46,555
I'm the one who's supposed
to look at the... ah! Ow!

252
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,699
Oh my God. I'm sorry!
- I'm just kidding.

253
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,799
I never get to do that.

254
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:54,907
Okay, because the cut is,
like, three inches higher.

255
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,007
Sorry.

256
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,322
Do you need my phone?
- Oh, no thanks.

257
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:02,523
It's just my mom. And it's only
her second page of the day.

258
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:04,282
She's just getting started.

259
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:07,187
Well, you're all set.
- Thank you.

260
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,718
So, do you think, uh...

261
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,915
we could do this again sometime,
maybe without the biting?

262
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:16,349
Yeah, that would be nice.

263
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,555
Heard from Kevin yet?
- Not yet. I've paged him.

264
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,026
Would you page him again?

265
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,819
Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

266
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,634
You're in a good mood.
- The last time the network executives...

267
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,162
came to my dressing room
I got my own show and a big fat raise.

268
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:34,746
Yeah and I had to start kissing your...
- Viola Fields? Oh my God!

269
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,628
It is such an honor to meet you.

270
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,098
Oh thank you, darling.

271
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,619
Would you mind
just signing this autograph?

272
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,719
For my grandmother.

273
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,607
I'd love to.

274
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,467
You know what else I'd love?

275
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,091
I'd love you to get me a latte.
Do you mind?

276
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:54,329
Okay.
- Thanks, hon.

277
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,538
Hi, guys.
How are you?

278
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,719
That woman is a legend.

279
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,027
Shouldn't you be getting the latte?

280
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:08,377
I just can't believe
they picked me to replace her.

281
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,879
Oh, shit!

282
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,803
I- I've been replaced?

283
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:18,423
I'm so sorry, Viola.

284
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,983
Psst!
I'm fine.

285
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,931
I mean, you've had
an amazing career, Viola.

286
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:29,846
It's just that we're trying to appeal
to a younger demographic.

287
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,579
I'm fine.

288
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,751
I'm fine.

289
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,698
God damn!
Get my manager on the phone!

290
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,707
And then I'm gonna call the head of the...

291
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,627
Uh, we're on in two minutes.

292
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,091
Okay.
- Will you get her to come?

293
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:47,093
Please!
- Okay, she'll be ready.

294
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:51,323
I'm ready.

295
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,985
Are you okay?
- I'm great.

296
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,906
Hey, I've had a great run.

297
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:09,690
I've done exclusives
with Kissinger, the Dalai Lama,

298
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,194
Muhammad Ali...

299
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,178
four sitting presidents...

300
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:14,907
three of them hit on me.

301
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,007
Five Emmys!

302
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,442
Now I'm being replaced by a young thing...

303
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,106
whose grandmother loves me.

304
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,026
You know what I'm gonna do?

305
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,723
I'm gonna finish out my contract...

306
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:28,603
and I'm gonna leave this show
with my dignity intact.

307
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,427
Okay, coming back from commercial.

308
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,866
Three, cue announcer.

309
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:34,075
Today on 'Public Intimacy,'

310
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,795
pop singing sensation Tanya Murphy.

311
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:39,866
And now we're live with Viola Fields.

312
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:43,283
Four, three, two...

313
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,010
Well, that was very nice.

314
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,146
My goodness, you have a big voice
for such a tiny girl.

315
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:50,747
You're gonna miss Viola Fields.

316
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,282
Have you always been a singer?

317
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,202
Ever since I was a child.

318
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,091
I would sing in school plays, choirs.

319
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,591
How old are you?
- I'll be 17 next month.

320
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:04,762
W- what do you do for fun?

321
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:07,226
I love watching really old movies.

322
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:09,691
They're my favorite.
- Really? Really, which ones?

323
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,605
Well, 'Grease' and 'Grease II.'

324
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:15,355
Um, 'Benji.' I love 'Benji. '

325
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,325
'Free Willy,' um...

326
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,866
'Legally Blonde,'

327
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,355
'The Little Mermaid.'

328
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:24,438
Oh.
- Yeah... oh, I know.

329
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,130
You ever read a newspaper?

330
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,666
Newspaper?

331
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:35,130
Viola, the girl has stars on her nipples.

332
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,787
I don't have much time for that.

333
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:42,075
So basically, you have absolutely
no idea what's going on in the world?

334
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:44,091
Oh, I...
- And yet, you've sold...

335
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:47,643
over five million albums... CDs,
to millions of kids...

336
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,842
who listen to your insipid lyrics.
- What is she doing?

337
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:54,299
'You want to know me,
look in my makeup bag.'

338
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,922
You're influencing
an entire generation of kids...

339
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,842
who won't know how to think straight,

340
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,762
or vote for a president,

341
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,514
or remember the significance
of Roe versus Wade.

342
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:07,062
Oh! I don't support boxing as a sport.

343
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:09,785
I think it's too violent.

344
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:13,818
Y'all better get that little girl out of there.

345
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:17,370
Holy crap!
- Get us off the air!

346
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,442
Quick!
- Go to commercial! Go to commercial!

347
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,362
Crazy bitch!
Get off me!

348
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,538
Cut! Cut! Put in the Bow Flex tape!
- Get her off!

349
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:26,638
Juice Man, something!

350
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:31,354
Oh, I don't support boxing as a sport.

351
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,788
I think it's too violent.

352
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:40,922
Oh.

353
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:44,987
I wanted you to take one last look
at the old Viola.

354
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:48,087
Oh, thank God I've changed.

355
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,850
Yes.

356
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,642
Well, just remember...

357
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:54,202
the breakdown was only
a few months ago...

358
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,922
so take it nice and slow out there.

359
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,714
No stress.

360
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,699
Absolutely.

361
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,450
In fact, I'm going to take a vacation.

362
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,851
I've been promising my son
we'd go to Africa...

363
00:20:05,951 --> 00:20:07,642
since he was a little boy.

364
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:10,010
And I finally have the time.

365
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,611
That's wonderful.

366
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,402
Not to worry,

367
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,542
I'm in complete control.

368
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,609
Ruby! Ruby,
my dear old friend.

369
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:22,713
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

370
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,762
Well, good,
they still have you medicated.

371
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:27,066
Ruby, I figured it out.

372
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,530
Life, I mean.
- Oh, this ought to be good.

373
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,339
It's not about how many celebrities
I interview or what my ratings are.

374
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:37,235
It's about relationships and family.
- Oh!

375
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,491
Me and my son.

376
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,667
Oh, I just spoke to Kevin.

377
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,026
Did you get the tickets?
- Sure did. Right here.

378
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,234
He's going to be so surprised.

379
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,634
Yeah, the three of you
should have a good time.

380
00:20:48,734 --> 00:20:51,549
Three?
- Yeah, uh, you, Kevin...

381
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,842
and his new girlfriend.
- New girlfriend?

382
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:57,244
That's a lovely surprise.

383
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:58,714
Is it?

384
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,594
Well, I mean,
it can't be too serious.

385
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,499
I've only been away a few months.

386
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:19,542
Well, that's the end of it.

387
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,562
Where do you want me to put this?

388
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:23,482
Oh, under the bed.

389
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,426
Uh, you sure you don't want me
to put it by the door so you can...

390
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:29,498
make a quick escape to the apartment you
still have for some reason?

391
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,803
Now come on. You agreed to me
subletting my apartment.

392
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:36,251
I would have agreed to anything
to get you to move in here.

393
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:38,202
Oh, these are great.
Are they new?

394
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,802
Oh, no!
You can't look at those!

395
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,786
'Cause they're not finished yet.
- Oh, sorry.

396
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,579
Okay? Please?
- Okay.

397
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,274
Here, I'll put them back.

398
00:21:45,374 --> 00:21:48,475
I forgot to tell you, we're having lunch
with my mom tomorrow.

399
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,909
Oh!

400
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,114
It’ll be fine.
I promise.

401
00:21:57,726 --> 00:21:59,706
You want to take a shower?

402
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,010
Hmm.

403
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:05,654
Yeah! Okay!

404
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,874
All right, so tell me about your dad.

405
00:22:14,974 --> 00:22:16,667
Well, he died when I was two.

406
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,426
But that was just her first husband.

407
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,730
At the time she was a freelance journalist...

408
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,962
and then she married this guy
who was a network exec...

409
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:25,882
and got her her first on-air break,

410
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:27,866
but divorced him for Alec Wrigley.

411
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,659
Wait, the actor?
I thought he was...

412
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,579
Oh, he was.
It lasted about two years...

413
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,842
till she threw him out for sleeping
with her second husband.

414
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,762
Wait, how many times
has she been married?

415
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,362
Well, four.
- Wow.

416
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,923
But, you know, her career
was always the main thing.

417
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:43,994
She just lived for it.
Well, her career and me, of course.

418
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:47,239
And, basically,
now I'm all she's got.

419
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:52,602
Here we are.

420
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:55,123
Oh, no.

421
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:04,317
Oh, playing dress-up,
are we?

422
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:11,897
Shut up. Is that the Dalai Lama?
- Yeah.

423
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,164
Oh my God, That can't be real.
- It is.

424
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,682
Did you know all these people?

425
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:20,602
Some of them.
- Kevin!

426
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:23,549
Look at you, all handsome.
- Ruby!

427
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,370
Good to see you.

428
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,066
Yeah, you too.

429
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,602
Now, forget about my mother.

430
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,674
This is the woman you need
to get through. Charlie, this is Ruby.

431
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:34,683
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, the pleasure's mine.

432
00:23:34,783 --> 00:23:39,118
Uh, excuse us.
I've got to talk to him about a rash.

433
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,082
You're bringing a girl home
to meet your mother now?

434
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:46,811
Yeah, Ruby, I am.

435
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:49,114
The women is fresh off the funny farm.

436
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:52,442
I mean, why don't you
come back, let's say... next spring?

437
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,426
Oh, the trees will be blooming.

438
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:56,986
It'll be so beautiful. She'll love it.
- How is she?

439
00:23:57,086 --> 00:23:59,674
She's good.
The first thing she did...

440
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:02,106
when she got home was make me
lock up all the booze.

441
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:04,026
It's Oprah!

442
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,428
Oprah!

443
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:08,026
Yeah, Oprah.

444
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:11,066
There's one in there
with the cast from 'Good Times' too.

445
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,555
So how big is this place?

446
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:15,898
About four acres.
There's a tennis court,

447
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,842
two swimming pools,
indoor and outdoor... it's kind of crazy.

448
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:21,398
What?
No helicopter pad?

449
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:22,682
Oh, no.
There's one out back.

450
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:24,282
I'm kidding.

451
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:25,722
Kevin!

452
00:24:25,822 --> 00:24:28,604
Oh, I've missed you so much!

453
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:31,783
I promise I'll never leave you again.

454
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,106
Oh my God, Mom.
Look at you. You look fantastic.

455
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,754
It's just something I threw together.
- Come here.

456
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:40,250
What?
- I want to introduce you to someone.

457
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,010
Charlie. Mom.
- Kevin.

458
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,663
Charlie, this is Mom.

459
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,202
Mom, Charlie.

460
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,342
Oh, hi.

461
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:52,442
Oh, I'd love to just be able
to think of it and make it.

462
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,810
I must have spent the last 30 years...

463
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,666
looking for the perfect little black...

464
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:58,586
Cocktail dress.
... cocktail dress. Yes.

465
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,218
I know.

466
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:03,322
Well, it doesn't matter. You could
wear anything with your figure.

467
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,594
I mean, you look amazing.
- Oh, honey, thanks.

468
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:11,389
Listen, when you're my age,
if ain't broke, you fix it before it is.

469
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:29,274
Why the question mark?

470
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,775
Oh, 'cause I just don't know.

471
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:34,325
I love your jewelry.

472
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,186
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.
- I love that.

473
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,714
I like it... the earth tones.
- It's fantastic.

474
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:40,858
Where did you get this from?
- My first husband.

475
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,514
That's Kevin's father. He gave it to me
when we were in Peru.

476
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:45,434
It's very earthy.
- It's like the dress,

477
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,534
very earthy.

478
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,474
I just think it's wonderful
that you've tried so many temp jobs.

479
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:59,804
Think of all the experiences you have.

480
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:02,746
You've been so quiet, Kevin.

481
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:05,690
Oh, well, it's kind of hard to get
a word in edgewise with you two.

482
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,343
Oh, is he great,
or what?

483
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:10,202
I tell you too,
that's a little scary.

484
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,310
Enjoy it while you can.

485
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,882
Here you go,
some more coffee.

486
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:16,442
Actually, I was a little nervous
about the two of you meeting.

487
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,882
Really?
- Why?

488
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:19,642
Well, 'cause it's important to me.

489
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:23,642
Mom, you're the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

490
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:25,946
And, Charlie,
I've never met anyone like you.

491
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:28,256
You're real,
you're honest.

492
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,714
And although we've only
known each other a few months,

493
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:34,044
I- I feel like I've known you forever.

494
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:37,724
I guess what I'm trying to say here...

495
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:42,490
is what are you doing
for the rest of your life?

496
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,695
What?

497
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,729
Oh my God!

498
00:26:52,766 --> 00:26:55,133
Charlie, will you marry me?

499
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,705
It's...
it's too sudden.

500
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:00,985
She's in shock.
- No!

501
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:03,541
I mean, I am, but...
- Yes!

502
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,714
Seriously?

503
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:08,602
Seriously.

504
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:10,330
No no. Say 'no.'

505
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,667
Yes. Yes!

506
00:27:12,702 --> 00:27:14,906
Yeah!

507
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:16,942
Oh, gee... oh!

508
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:23,834
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

509
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,714
Congratulations!
- Oh my God. I can't believe this.

510
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,186
I am so happy for you.

511
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:30,874
Congratulations!
I'm so pleased...

512
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:34,629
that you're going to be my daughter-in-law.

513
00:27:35,518 --> 00:27:37,338
Oh, congratulations.

514
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:39,770
I can't believe this.
- I'm so happy for you.

515
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,034
Thank you!
- You're going to need a moment alone.

516
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:45,370
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

517
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,650
Oh!

518
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,750
Shit!

519
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,353
Medicine.

520
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:57,273
Let's see.

521
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:58,874
No.

522
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:01,047
What's... ah!

523
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:03,086
14% alcohol!

524
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:10,842
You are so crazy! Oh my God!
- I almost forgot.

525
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:14,201
I've been carrying this around for two
weeks waiting for the perfect moment.

526
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:17,786
I can't believe this turned out to be it.

527
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:21,805
Kevin.
- Try it on.

528
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:29,803
It is the perfect moment.

529
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,490
Maybe you should go check on your mom.

530
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,338
Oh, she's fine. She's probably
calling all of our relatives.

531
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:40,253
Oh, Holy Spirit...

532
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,490
surround me with light.

533
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:46,554
Please rid me of my negative karma...

534
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:48,378
and my wickedness.

535
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,511
Please help me be a better person.

536
00:28:53,118 --> 00:28:57,308
I could just kill that dog-walking slut!

537
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,586
Of course.

538
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:05,621
She's pregnant.

539
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:10,713
So, goodness.
That was a lot to take in at teatime.

540
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,146
Oh, you're telling me.
- I had no idea...

541
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:15,002
that you guys were so serious.

542
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,986
Kevin, you never mentioned anything.

543
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,418
Mom.
- Here's what I want to say.

544
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:21,401
It's wonderful being in love.

545
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:27,281
But I don't think marriage is
the best solution to a thing like this.

546
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,810
Well, you know nowadays
a girl has so many alternatives...

547
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,177
to getting married...
there's adoption, abortion,

548
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:35,418
lesbianism... Hmm?
- Whoa, Mom!

549
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:38,362
What are you talking about?
- Well, I mean, it's so sudden

550
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:40,538
I have to assume there's a pressing reason.

551
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:42,638
Oh oh, no.

552
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,654
Charlie's not pregnant.

553
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,820
Call me old-fashioned,

554
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:51,130
marriage is a sacred union...

555
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,490
that should only be entered into
with the utmost care.

556
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,225
Weren't you married four times?

557
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,110
Yes, dear.

558
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,258
Which would make me an expert,
don't you think?

559
00:30:03,358 --> 00:30:05,358
Excuse me.

560
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,722
It's the hospital.
I'll be right back.

561
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,450
Okay.

562
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,370
You want me to go with you?

563
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,470
No, stay right there.

564
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:29,561
You know, this is as sudden
for me as it is for you.

565
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,481
It's too sudden, right?

566
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,242
You think?

567
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:34,682
Yeah.

568
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:36,782
Really?

569
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:45,242
I mean, what's the rush?
It's not like the old days...

570
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:47,097
where you had to get married
and have kids,

571
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,210
and have it all figured out
by the time you were 21.

572
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,193
Exactly.
- We have options now.

573
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:53,242
And I've always liked
having my options, you know?

574
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,586
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

575
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,915
This is so... big.

576
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:03,092
What am I...
what am I doing?

577
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,686
I love Kevin.

578
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,602
I want to spend the rest of my life with him.

579
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,419
Oh my God!
I'm getting married!

580
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,762
Ruby!

581
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:23,546
Ruby, I need a bottle of champagne.
We're going to celebrate.

582
00:31:23,646 --> 00:31:26,105
May I have the key
to the liquor cabinet please?

583
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,205
What key?

584
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,874
The key, Ruby.

585
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,395
Key?
There's no key.

586
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:36,285
Ruby, give me the key.

587
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:38,867
You want to take this outside?

588
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,096
Bring me the key.

589
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,457
And fix your hair.

590
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:53,277
You look like a damned cockatoo.

591
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:59,258
She is such a fabulous assistant.

592
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:08,058
Hey, do you think your mother liked me?

593
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:10,296
Of course. Why?

594
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:14,924
I don't know, because she called me
a pregnant lesbian?

595
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,402
I'm sure she meant that as a compliment.

596
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,836
Trust me.
She loved you.

597
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:22,291
Oh, they're gone?

598
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:24,825
I'll just put this baby back to bed, okay?

599
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:28,537
My son the brilliant surgeon...

600
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:33,080
is gonna marry a temp.

601
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:44,634
Gonna need something stronger than this.

602
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:46,971
Where's that martini?

603
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,529
Hooch will not solve your problems.

604
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:52,728
She's going to destroy him.

605
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:54,650
It is so clear.

606
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,178
She's got no money,
no career goals.

607
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,993
She was just waiting for a rich innocent...

608
00:33:00,093 --> 00:33:01,561
to step right in her path.

609
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:03,929
Oh, Kevin's smarter than that.

610
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:05,818
Come on,
you raised him well.

611
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,417
He's a good boy.

612
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,466
But he's a man.
That's the problem.

613
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:12,442
The only time they think straight
is when they have an erection,

614
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,482
and it's usually pointed
right at the trampiest woman.

615
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:18,746
You talking about her or you?

616
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:21,781
Look, there's nothing you can do.

617
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:23,129
Just let it go.

618
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:25,530
You know what you need?
A project.

619
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,129
Or another husband.

620
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,401
You know, why don't you
marry another gay guy?

621
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:31,001
That was fun.

622
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:33,101
You know, you're right.

623
00:33:33,118 --> 00:33:34,874
I do need a project.

624
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:37,625
And I have the perfect one.

625
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:39,641
I am going to save my son.

626
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:41,781
Here.

627
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,866
What?
- You go use those old contacts of yours...

628
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:46,586
to get all the information you can
about that little pimp.

629
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:49,018
And exactly what do you expect to find?

630
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:52,151
Everybody's got a past, honey.

631
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,229
Find something.

632
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,377
And I'm going to open up
the Montecito house...

633
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:58,041
and get a party planner.

634
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:00,954
I'm going to give them
an engagement party.

635
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:03,162
And then what?
Lock her in the basement?

636
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:05,338
When he sees how out of place
she is in his world,

637
00:34:05,438 --> 00:34:07,739
it's gonna be over.

638
00:34:07,774 --> 00:34:10,294
This will end badly.

639
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,714
Get me another one of those.

640
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:31,380
Is it me, or is each house
you take me to bigger than the last?

641
00:34:35,837 --> 00:34:38,553
But I thought your mom
said this was a barbecue.

642
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:43,577
Oh my God. It looks like she's invited
everyone I've ever known.

643
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:46,041
And they're all in black tie.

644
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:47,961
Oh, there's my mom.
Mom!

645
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:51,258
Darlings!
How was the trip?

646
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:53,366
Welcome.
- I'm sorry.

647
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,449
I didn't know this was a formal party.
- Well, that's because

648
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:57,594
I have something for you.
I bought you a new dress.

649
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:59,385
Oh, see?
There's a dress upstairs.

650
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:01,593
Thank you.
- Besides, you look great in anything.

651
00:35:01,693 --> 00:35:04,441
Exactly. You always look
so clean and shiny.

652
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:07,961
Oh, Kevin, your tuxedo
is upstairs in your room.

653
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:10,489
But first I want you to meet
some friends. Come.

654
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:13,394
Prince Amir.
- Can I change first?

655
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,946
This is Sarah. Kevin.
- You know Kevin.

656
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:20,851
And this is Charlie.
She's a temp.

657
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,241
Charlie, this is the man that introduced the
euro to the global market.

658
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:26,969
Mr. Prime Minister.
- Viola.

659
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:29,593
Oh, Marie. You know my son,
but this is Charlie.

660
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,441
Very good to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

661
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,713
She's a temp.
- Yeah.

662
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:37,171
I worked in a bank once.

663
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,257
Oh, look! There's the Poet Laureate and...

664
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:42,554
oh, Charlie, first I want you to meet
the Secretary of Commerce.

665
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,185
Viola, please let me change first.

666
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:46,265
I don't want to meet her in my flip-flops.

667
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:49,561
Of course, of course. Ruby, would
you show Charlie to the guest room?

668
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:53,061
Come on, Charlie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

669
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:00,121
Wow!

670
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:01,818
Oh my...

671
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,958
it's vintage.

672
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:07,446
Oh, Fiona.

673
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:10,329
You look stunning.
- Thank you. So do you.

674
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,314
My goodness.

675
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,490
Kevin just went up to his old room.

676
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,049
Why don't you go say hello to him?
- I'd love to.

677
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,149
Good girl.

678
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,937
Fiona, what are you doing here?
I'm dressing.

679
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,401
Why don't you let me give you
a hand with that?

680
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:39,890
Give it up, Fiona.

681
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:45,144
You know, you and I had
a very strong bond once.

682
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:48,281
No, you and I had very strong drinks once.

683
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:49,818
That's not true.

684
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,857
Kiss me. I'll remind you how good it was.

685
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,202
What are you doing?

686
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:55,930
I'm engaged.
I'm happy.

687
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,234
It's gonna fit!

688
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:01,499
Why did she get me such a small dress?

689
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,590
I have two asses.

690
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:10,262
It'll fit.
There we go.

691
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:11,801
Okay.

692
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:14,290
Okay! Okay!

693
00:37:17,661 --> 00:37:19,930
What is it about her that's so special?

694
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,497
I don't know but I plan on spending
the rest of my life finding out.

695
00:37:25,597 --> 00:37:27,669
Kevin!

696
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,834
God! Men in love are really hot.

697
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,357
Fiona!

698
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:36,217
Oops! Um...

699
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:39,705
I was just giving Kevin
a congratulatory kiss.

700
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,391
Don't, uh, worry.

701
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,319
Why would I worry?
He's gay, right?

702
00:37:49,117 --> 00:37:51,117
Charlie!

703
00:37:57,885 --> 00:37:59,994
Charlie, that was not what it looked like.

704
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:01,625
I'm going home.

705
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:04,627
I've destroyed priceless couture.

706
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:09,401
I embarrassed myself
in front of 70% of the world's royalty.

707
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:11,321
Oh! I forgot, yeah!

708
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:15,385
I just caught you making out
with your ex-girlfriend.

709
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,305
Charlie, let me explain.

710
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:19,577
Ugh!
It doesn't matter.

711
00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:24,248
I can't do this.

712
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,069
I don't belong here,
Kevin.

713
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:34,137
And if I don't belong here
then maybe we don't...

714
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:35,737
Hey hey hey.
Listen to me.

715
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:37,837
It's you and me now.

716
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,570
This isn't my world anymore.

717
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,670
You're my world.

718
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:51,065
Okay?

719
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,561
Now let's get the hell out of here.
I'm taking you home.

720
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,766
Okay.

721
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,081
Um...

722
00:38:57,181 --> 00:39:00,857
Let me try and get out
of this dress and then...

723
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:03,082
Okay, see you downstairs.

724
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,745
Do you like it?

725
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:44,409
Yeah, it's great.

726
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:46,649
I'm so glad you finally decided to do it.

727
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:50,777
I don't know. I just woke up today
and it just felt like home.

728
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,081
I'm gonna do all three walls.

729
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:55,705
You know, I think it's time to take a break.

730
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,049
Oh, wait!

731
00:39:57,149 --> 00:39:59,290
Wait a minute.
- Whoo whoo whoo!

732
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,985
I can't let it dry too much.

733
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,703
Oh God!

734
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,930
Are we getting out of bed today, 'Camille'?

735
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,233
What for?

736
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:12,409
I could die and nobody would care.

737
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,913
I would.

738
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:16,599
You promised me a face-lift.

739
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:20,122
Sit down, Ruby.
Sit with me, hold my hand.

740
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:24,858
Have you got anything on the girl yet?

741
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,778
Nothing. Nada.

742
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,665
No criminal record.
No debt.

743
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:31,897
Good grades. Went to design school.
And then a string of odd jobs.

744
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:34,521
Isn't that exactly what
somebody with a past does?

745
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:36,889
What about drugs?
What about promiscuity?

746
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:38,809
She's had fewer lovers in her entire life...

747
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:41,369
than you did at closing day of Woodstock.

748
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:44,252
Well, find something.

749
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:47,769
Well, I guess if I had
a hair sample maybe I could take it...

750
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,809
to my little crime lab and...
- Perfect.

751
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,665
I'll get to work on it.

752
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:55,318
Listen to me.
There is nothing.

753
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:58,265
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe she's a good girl?

754
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,365
Oh, don't joke.

755
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,921
I would like to speak to that woman
who got back from the loony bin.

756
00:41:05,021 --> 00:41:06,649
Is she around?

757
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:11,509
Because you are taking me
for a spin in the crazy mobile.

758
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:13,081
Ruby, Ruby.

759
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,609
Everybody knows that when
a woman marries a man...

760
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,529
she marries his mother too, right?

761
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:20,411
What if I drive her crazy?

762
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,675
Okay, now you're foaming at the mouth.

763
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:29,229
Oh!

764
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:31,513
Charlie and Kevin's house.

765
00:41:31,613 --> 00:41:34,264
Oh, I forgot you live there.

766
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,905
I didn't realize that you
had already moved in.

767
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:42,681
Kevin, stop it. I'm on the phone
with your mother! I'm sorry, Viola.

768
00:41:42,781 --> 00:41:44,985
The slut's practically fornicating with him!

769
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,457
Stop it!
- I don't blame her.

770
00:41:46,557 --> 00:41:47,993
That boy's a fine piece of ass.

771
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:51,449
Hold on, Viola.
He's... stop it! Right here.

772
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:53,401
Actually, Charlie,
the reason I'm calling...

773
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,057
is I wondered if you'd
like to have lunch next week.

774
00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:59,638
Really?
- How would Tuesday work for you?

775
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:02,230
Yeah,
Tuesday's perfect!

776
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,049
Listen, Viola, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now,

777
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:07,149
um, but Tuesday's fine.

778
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,857
Yeah, me too.

779
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:11,826
Lots to do!
- Okay, bye!

780
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:14,861
Oh.

781
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:19,605
I'll go get the vodka.

782
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,621
It's good to see you.

783
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:35,661
There she is.

784
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:42,135
Charlotte.

785
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:45,305
Hi. I'm going to have the garden salad...

786
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:49,177
and the low-cal Chinese dressing
and a decaf iced tea.

787
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,833
And you, miss?
- Oh, um, I'll just have a...

788
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:55,195
cheeseburger with fries and a soda.

789
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:56,729
All right.
- Okay.

790
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:59,546
You continue to surprise me.

791
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:02,489
Aren't you worried about fitting
in your wedding dress?

792
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:05,369
Well, I mean, I'm making the dress
to fit my body,

793
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:06,969
not the other way around.

794
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:09,817
Whoa. I wish I had been
that confident when I got married.

795
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:12,473
I'll tell you one thing
you're gonna have that I never did,

796
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,573
a stupendous wedding.

797
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:18,201
And it's important that we
book the church right away.

798
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:21,241
I always thought
that Kevin looked like Jesus...

799
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:24,996
in the cathedral down
on Second Street. Mmm.

800
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:28,185
Actually, we were thinking of having...

801
00:43:28,285 --> 00:43:30,392
a non-denominational service,

802
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:33,017
being that I'm more spiritual than religious.

803
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:35,117
Oh.

804
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:38,073
What about my place then?

805
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,377
That way we don't even
need to book a location.

806
00:43:40,477 --> 00:43:42,617
And Kevin was born there
and grew up there.

807
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:45,305
Oh, it would mean
so much to him. I'll plan it all.

808
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:48,825
We'll have that marvelous band
that the Swansons' had at their wedding.

809
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:50,809
And a divine cake.
Oh, honey!

810
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,948
No no no!
Tsk tsk tsk!

811
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:55,709
Chewing,
it's a disgusting habit.

812
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,817
Oh, hold still.
I've gotta... gotta...

813
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,449
There! Got it!
- Ow!

814
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:02,712
Thanks, um...

815
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:05,299
What do you think about peach?

816
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:08,825
Oh, um, excuse me.
- Yes?

817
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:10,745
Can I get another salad without the nuts?

818
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:12,761
I have allergies.
- Okay.

819
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,545
I'm allergic to nuts,
and eggs, and shellfish,

820
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:18,040
and blueberries.
Oh... and soy.

821
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,361
It's amazing you've been able
to nourish yourself all these years.

822
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:24,281
Oh, yeah!
The cake!

823
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:28,217
I'm thinking traditional vanilla
with strawberry drizzle.

824
00:44:28,317 --> 00:44:32,440
Look, Viola, I really do
have all of this under control.

825
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,041
I made this for you.

826
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:37,286
It's your wedding planner book.
Peach.

827
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:40,665
Oh.

828
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,585
Is that a picture of me and Kevin?

829
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:46,255
Oh, and... present time
from your new mama!

830
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,269
Thanks.

831
00:44:53,853 --> 00:44:56,952
Wow!

832
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:59,769
It's big! You can see
the thorns on the roses.

833
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,329
You'll wear it on your wedding day,
just like I did.

834
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:04,921
Of course I was a virgin when I wed.

835
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:07,741
But we'll just pretend with you.

836
00:45:07,776 --> 00:45:09,561
Now, about the wedding...

837
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:12,185
the two of you are going to arrive
in a horse and carriage.

838
00:45:12,285 --> 00:45:15,449
And the driver's top-hat
will match the horse's saddles,

839
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,113
and the ribbons on the doves...

840
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:20,088
that will be released at the exact moment...

841
00:45:20,188 --> 00:45:23,003
of 'I do,' hmm?

842
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,777
And I've been in touch
with your bridesmaids.

843
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:28,441
How do you know their names?

844
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,193
Well, Kevin told me.
And I think for the honeymoon

845
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,913
St. Bart's is the absolute
best place for you to go...

846
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,089
'cause Kevin adores it.
- Hey, just hold on!

847
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:38,314
Just wait a minute, okay?

848
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,849
No.

849
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,088
Thank you, but no.

850
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,875
Thank you,
but no to everything.

851
00:45:46,909 --> 00:45:50,008
No to the horse and buggy.

852
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:52,793
No to the top-hats,
and to the doves and geese...

853
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,608
and any other farm animals
you're thinking of using that day.

854
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,105
And definitely no to you
planning our honeymoon.

855
00:45:58,205 --> 00:45:59,448
What?
- Oh no.

856
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,793
I can... oh!

857
00:46:00,893 --> 00:46:03,610
Oh oh!
- What's wrong?

858
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,497
'Oh no' what?
- My pills, my pills!

859
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:06,776
Okay.
Well, let me help you.

860
00:46:06,876 --> 00:46:09,364
Oh!
- Viola!

861
00:46:09,404 --> 00:46:11,257
Oh, no!
- Wait, Viola!

862
00:46:11,357 --> 00:46:12,921
Viola!

863
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,841
Viola!

864
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,624
Oh my God, Viola.
Oh my God!

865
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,481
Give her some room.
- Help!

866
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,136
Give her some air.
- My God, is she dead?

867
00:46:22,236 --> 00:46:24,236
No!
- Get her some help.

868
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:26,377
It couldn't be that easy.

869
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:32,633
She's had an anxiety attack,

870
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:34,777
which can feel like a heart attack.

871
00:46:34,877 --> 00:46:36,377
She's gonna be okay.

872
00:46:36,477 --> 00:46:39,961
But she definitely needs
to take it easy. No stress.

873
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,937
She said that you were yelling at her,

874
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,553
that you refused her gift
and said she couldn't plan our wedding.

875
00:46:46,653 --> 00:46:49,238
Tell me that's not true.

876
00:46:49,277 --> 00:46:52,091
Well, technically...

877
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,273
yes.

878
00:46:53,373 --> 00:46:55,961
But, hold on.
I didn't yell at her.

879
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:58,264
And she just kept pushing
and pushing and pushing.

880
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:01,048
And, okay, I admit it.
I snapped a little bit. But...

881
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:03,864
What was I supposed to do?
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

882
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:06,521
Come on, look, you know
what a hard time she's been having.

883
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,537
So she's a little difficult.
- Difficult?

884
00:47:08,637 --> 00:47:09,945
A two-year-old is difficult.

885
00:47:10,045 --> 00:47:12,121
She's like... ah!
- Come on, she's all alone.

886
00:47:12,221 --> 00:47:14,041
I'm all she's got...
we're all she's got.

887
00:47:14,141 --> 00:47:16,344
Come on.

888
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,720
Excuse me.

889
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,217
I'm Dr. Chamberlain,
the psychiatrist in residence.

890
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:21,721
Are you Mrs. Fields's son?
- Yes.

891
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:24,313
May we speak in private?
- Actually, this is my fiancée.

892
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:26,073
We can talk.
Um, is she okay?

893
00:47:26,173 --> 00:47:29,145
Well, I just completed your mother's
interview and I'm concerned.

894
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:32,889
It's possible that she's on the verge
of a psychotic break.

895
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:36,697
I should probably see her
at least twice a week, minimum.

896
00:47:36,797 --> 00:47:39,417
Also, I prescribed her
some anti-anxiety medication.

897
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:42,009
If she starts to feel
overwhelmed, they'll relax her.

898
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,577
Does she live alone?

899
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:44,921
Uh, yeah.

900
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:47,001
Well, I feel it would be best...

901
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:48,857
if she were cared for by relatives...

902
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:51,193
people that are closest
to her during this time.

903
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:53,625
Just until we're confident
that she's out of danger.

904
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:56,615
All right.
Well, thank you, Doctor.

905
00:47:57,372 --> 00:47:59,511
Oh, God.

906
00:47:59,548 --> 00:48:01,305
I've got that medical conference.

907
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:02,744
What am I gonna do?

908
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:05,753
You know what?
Don't... don't worry about it.

909
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,406
Um, I'll take care of her.

910
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:12,536
Thank you.

911
00:48:12,636 --> 00:48:14,329
Come on.
- What?

912
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:16,536
No, come with me.
- No no, the doctor said no stress.

913
00:48:16,636 --> 00:48:21,481
Charlie, come on. Enough already.
- I'll stay here. Kevin!

914
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,525
Come on.

915
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:30,008
I am so sorry.

916
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:32,281
No, Mom, don't be.
It's okay, really.

917
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:34,381
Charlie?

918
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:37,755
I'm sorry too, Viola.

919
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,960
No, I was too pushy.

920
00:48:41,244 --> 00:48:42,744
No.

921
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:45,299
You weren't.
Look, Viola...

922
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:49,049
I would love it if you would
help me with the wedding.

923
00:48:49,149 --> 00:48:51,866
It's all right,
sweetheart, I...

924
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,976
I don't really think I'm up to it.

925
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:56,076
My nerves are shot.

926
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:01,005
Mom...

927
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:05,209
Mom, Charlie and I think
you should live with us for a while,

928
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,097
until you feel better.

929
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:09,197
Are you sure?

930
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,781
Oh!

931
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:15,610
Oh, I can't possibly.

932
00:49:15,644 --> 00:49:18,619
I couldn't.
- Mom, it's okay. Relax.

933
00:49:19,388 --> 00:49:21,388
I couldn't possibly.

934
00:49:22,845 --> 00:49:26,415
Not unless I know Charlotte's forgiven me.

935
00:49:26,652 --> 00:49:28,652
Will you?

936
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:30,841
Me?

937
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:32,941
Yeah, I forgive you.

938
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:40,794
You just put those anywhere.

939
00:49:43,932 --> 00:49:45,932
Hi!
- Hi.

940
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,248
Are you feeling better?
- I'm much better, thank you.

941
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:50,360
Great.
- Sweetheart, I'm kind of thirsty.

942
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,601
Would you... is the kitchen over there?
- Yeah, sure.

943
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,937
Great. Goodbye.
- Okay.

944
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,681
Hey, Charlie.
- Are you moving in, too?

945
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:00,601
No, I don't like the neighborhood.

946
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:02,969
Look, do you have any
firearms in the house?

947
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:06,069
No.
- You might want to get one.

948
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,229
When will you be back?

949
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:17,367
Soon as I can, honey.
I promise.

950
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,481
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

951
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,552
Yeah. I mean, hey,
it's only at night, right?

952
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,953
And, I mean, she's gonna
sleep most of the time...

953
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:27,800
with those pills the doctor gave her. Right?

954
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,457
Look, I know my mom can be
a little challenging.

955
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:32,729
So if you have any problems just call me.

956
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,745
I'm on the first flight back,
I promise.

957
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,049
Okay.
Well, hurry home.

958
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:38,904
And who knows?
By the time I get back,

959
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:41,369
maybe you two will be best friends.

960
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,320
Oh, am I interrupting something?

961
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,401
Uh, no, Mom, come in.
- The caterer called.

962
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,321
He still thinks I'm doing the wedding.

963
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,328
He sent over a sample plate
'cause I gave him the colors you wanted.

964
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:52,441
I said absolutely no peach.

965
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:56,856
And from now on, everything
goes through my new daughter.

966
00:50:56,956 --> 00:50:58,680
Thank you.
- Yeah?

967
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,248
Okay, I'll be right down, thanks.

968
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,145
Oh, here. Look.
- Oh, it's beautiful, Viola.

969
00:51:04,188 --> 00:51:06,425
Thank you.
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.

970
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:08,376
Thanks.
- My car's here. Gotta go.

971
00:51:08,476 --> 00:51:09,817
Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

972
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,537
Oh, bye, sweetie.
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

973
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,713
We're gonna have such a good time.
- I love you.

974
00:51:14,813 --> 00:51:16,697
I'll be a good roommate. I promise.
- Okay.

975
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:19,186
Ohh!

976
00:51:19,228 --> 00:51:22,392
It's so nice to have a girlfriend.

977
00:51:22,428 --> 00:51:24,428
Yeah, huh?

978
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:51,128
Viola?

979
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:54,524
Are you all right?
- I can't sleep.

980
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:59,221
I feel so alone.

981
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,080
I do.

982
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,390
You're not alone.
I'm here.

983
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:07,451
Did you take your pills?

984
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:10,899
My pills?
Oh no, I forgot.

985
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,240
Could you get them for me, sweetie?

986
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,224
They're on the sink.

987
00:52:15,324 --> 00:52:17,324
Sure.

988
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,476
Here they are.

989
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:29,723
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

990
00:52:29,757 --> 00:52:32,504
Oh, I don't have any water.
Could you get me some water please?

991
00:52:32,604 --> 00:52:34,993
Okay.

992
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:37,841
Oh, I can't drink out of the tap.

993
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:41,839
Would you get me some Evian...
with ice?

994
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:44,589
Yeah.

995
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,241
Here you go.

996
00:52:53,341 --> 00:52:55,341
Oh, thank you.

997
00:52:57,404 --> 00:52:59,699
You have a good night,
okay?

998
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,168
Charlotte?

999
00:53:02,268 --> 00:53:04,024
I hate to ask you this,

1000
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:06,329
but it's my first night here.

1001
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:08,916
Could you stay with me?

1002
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:10,712
Please?

1003
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,277
Sleep with me.
Be a good girl.

1004
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,849
Huh? No no no!

1005
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:20,404
No no, don't!

1006
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:24,115
God! Viola!

1007
00:53:24,156 --> 00:53:27,301
Are you okay?
- No, let go of me, you!

1008
00:53:29,277 --> 00:53:31,666
No.

1009
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,720
Huh? Oh!

1010
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,820
Okay. Okay.

1011
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,675
Hi, how was your day?

1012
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:13,304
It was... okay.

1013
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,064
Wonderful!

1014
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:16,504
You're cooking.

1015
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:19,480
I wanted to make you dinner all by myself.

1016
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,580
Sit.
- Okay.

1017
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:26,328
It's steak and kidney pie.

1018
00:54:26,428 --> 00:54:29,497
Actually, the steak didn't defrost
in time so it's mostly kidney.

1019
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,480
Mmm!

1020
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,580
Do you like it?
- Mm-hm!

1021
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:37,716
I made a decision today.

1022
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:40,472
I called my lawyer
and I asked him to redo my will.

1023
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:43,462
I want to include my new daughter.

1024
00:54:46,877 --> 00:54:48,824
Really, Viola,
that's not necessary.

1025
00:54:48,924 --> 00:54:50,648
Oh, don't be silly.
I want to.

1026
00:54:50,748 --> 00:54:53,816
Of course they have all these
stupid questions that they want to ask.

1027
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,600
You know, like, 'Are you
currently an illegal alien?'

1028
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,318
Oh, uh, no.

1029
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:02,520
Oh, that's interesting.
Okay.

1030
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,625
Um, are there any hereditary illnesses
in your family?

1031
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:08,505
You know, the kind that could be
passed on to grandchildren?

1032
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,329
Uh, no.
- No.

1033
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:13,240
How many men have you been
sexually active with?

1034
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,384
What? Why would they want to know that?

1035
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:18,167
That many, huh?

1036
00:55:18,205 --> 00:55:22,540
Would you be willing to sign
a prenuptial agreement?

1037
00:55:23,164 --> 00:55:25,016
Excuse me?
- I know.

1038
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:27,832
They're such nosy bastards.
It's none of their business.

1039
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:29,336
Let's just deal with this later.

1040
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:32,836
No, why don't we deal with it right now?

1041
00:55:34,652 --> 00:55:36,696
I'll tell you what,
I'll clean up the kitchen...

1042
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:38,008
and you continue enjoying your dinner.

1043
00:55:38,108 --> 00:55:40,629
No no no.

1044
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:42,969
You did all the cooking.
I'll clean up.

1045
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,760
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1046
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:47,162
I am kind of tired.
Thanks.

1047
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:48,952
Well, I'll just go up to bed then.

1048
00:55:49,052 --> 00:55:51,448
I had kind of a difficult night last night.

1049
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,758
You had a difficult night?

1050
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,256
He's skidding out of control.

1051
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,651
This bus is out of control.

1052
00:56:06,844 --> 00:56:08,664
Is somebody there?

1053
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,935
Tina.

1054
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:14,488
Tina.

1055
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:16,588
Who the hell is that?

1056
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:36,184
Oh.

1057
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:38,104
What?
Oh my God.

1058
00:56:38,204 --> 00:56:40,984
I thought you were sleeping.
- Well, I couldn't sleep.

1059
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:42,904
Hmm? What do you think of my outfit?

1060
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:45,721
This is a ceremonial robe
given to me by Chairman Mao.

1061
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:47,320
These go with the robe.

1062
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,200
This was a birthday gift
from the Dalai Lama.

1063
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,344
He never forgot my birthday.

1064
00:56:52,444 --> 00:56:54,712
Of course now he doesn't care anymore.

1065
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:56,632
Do you mind if I sit with you?
- No.

1066
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,552
Just for a little while.
- Okay.

1067
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:02,843
Why is she running?

1068
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:05,396
Well, someone's chasing her.

1069
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:07,640
Why is he chasing her?

1070
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:09,749
I'm not sure.

1071
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:11,289
Well, who is he?

1072
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:13,400
I don't know.
We have to watch.

1073
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,640
You have to stop talking.
- Mm.

1074
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,560
Don't you hate what she's wearing?

1075
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,280
Running out there
with bare feet and, what is that,

1076
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,520
a pajama top?
It's so unrealistic.

1077
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,368
I once did a whole segment
on nighttime television.

1078
00:57:25,468 --> 00:57:27,857
You would not believe...

1079
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,137
how much the demographics
influence the networks.

1080
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:33,240
I mean it's just ridiculous.
All they care about is the bottom line.

1081
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,289
Oh, it's so nice just to sit
with family and do nothing, huh?

1082
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:38,040
Don't even need to talk.
It's wonderful.

1083
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,184
I miss so much being a working mom.

1084
00:57:40,284 --> 00:57:42,040
I used to bring Kevin,
though, to the set.

1085
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,928
That's where he met
Gore Vidal and Jackie Chan.

1086
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,497
Is there anybody famous in this movie?

1087
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:47,000
Because I don't know any of them.

1088
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,664
And they all look the same... all the girls...

1089
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:50,968
have the same body,
all the boys have the same hair.

1090
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,528
...so many beautiful people
who live in Los Angeles?

1091
00:57:53,628 --> 00:57:56,344
I think all the beautiful genes
ended up in California.

1092
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:59,589
Why is he kissing her?
It's beyond me.

1093
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:20,245
I'm sorry. I thought it was air freshener.

1094
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:31,861
Charlie?
- Dr. Batel's office.

1095
00:58:32,828 --> 00:58:34,901
Miss Reynolds?

1096
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,760
Hi.

1097
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,520
Yeah.

1098
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,856
Nope. Okay.

1099
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,997
Bye.

1100
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:48,533
Oh God. I-I'm sorry.

1101
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,744
You know what?
That's probably my fault.

1102
00:58:50,844 --> 00:58:53,368
I mean,
I never thought she'd...

1103
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:55,352
I mean, she's a little eccentric, you know?

1104
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,976
I'm sorry.
- Well, It doesn't matter.

1105
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,240
I don't want to talk about your mom
tonight. I want to talk about us.

1106
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,503
I miss you.
- I miss you too.

1107
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,152
Especially now when I'm in the tub...

1108
00:59:08,188 --> 00:59:11,188
naked and wet...

1109
00:59:11,228 --> 00:59:13,048
and naked.

1110
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:15,832
Really?

1111
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:17,848
Well, do you know what I would do
to you if I was there?

1112
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:19,480
What?
- Well, for starters...

1113
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,208
Charlie!

1114
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,096
I'm not looking. I'm not looking.
- Hello?

1115
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,208
I just wanted to return your shampoo.
- Your mom just walked in.

1116
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:27,928
You really should use a shampoo
that doesn't dry your hair so much.

1117
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:30,360
We don't want a bride
with straw under her veil.

1118
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,280
Oh, is that Kevin?
- Yeah, it is.

1119
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,680
Honey, your mom wants to talk to you.
- Sweetie, hi.

1120
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,040
Hi, Mom.
- Honey, I can't thank you both enough.

1121
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,848
Of course.
- I'm having the most wonderful time.

1122
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,216
How's Charlie?
- Oh, she's been a doll.

1123
00:59:44,316 --> 00:59:46,328
We've been girlfriends all week.

1124
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:49,176
Great.
- I'm gonna be sad to go home.

1125
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:53,016
You do? Well, you never know
what the future's gonna bring right?

1126
00:59:53,116 --> 00:59:54,904
I mean, I do love this neighborhood.

1127
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,440
In fact, you know,
two doors down,

1128
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,424
there's this house for sale.

1129
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:00,344
It's got two big bay windows...

1130
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:02,104
and a great rose garden.

1131
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:04,024
You know how I love rose gardens.

1132
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:06,456
And basically,
it's got my name all over it.

1133
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:08,376
I'm having my...
my... um...

1134
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:10,328
real estate guy look into it.

1135
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:11,960
She's buying a house here?

1136
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,752
Two doors away.

1137
01:00:13,852 --> 01:00:16,696
'Lovely property.
Beautiful bay windows.'

1138
01:00:16,796 --> 01:00:18,616
It's bullshit!

1139
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,760
She doesn't even like this neighborhood.

1140
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,032
Oh God, I'm so exhausted.

1141
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:24,920
She's driving me insane!

1142
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,151
I can't do this.
- Yes, you can!

1143
01:00:28,188 --> 01:00:30,971
Stop being such a big baby.

1144
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:33,240
Kevin is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1145
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,472
Charlie, do not give up on this one.

1146
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,328
It seems Mommy Dearest
has been keeping...

1147
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,148
a very close eye on you,
sweetie.

1148
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,864
What are you talking about?
What are you doing in her clothes?

1149
01:00:43,964 --> 01:00:47,224
I was just upstairs in her room
minding my own business.

1150
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:49,848
And I found all of this in her closet.

1151
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:52,312
She's been investigating you.

1152
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:53,944
Whoa.

1153
01:00:54,044 --> 01:00:56,152
Why does she have
your high school transcripts?

1154
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,252
I know.

1155
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:01,624
There's a picture of me at the beach? !

1156
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,224
Yes, it is.
- I can't believe that.

1157
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:05,304
There's another picture of you in here.

1158
01:01:05,404 --> 01:01:06,584
And it's... look.

1159
01:01:06,684 --> 01:01:08,120
Look at that.
It's like a close-up.

1160
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:10,583
But you have to be close to take that, right?

1161
01:01:10,683 --> 01:01:12,440
Look at all this Gucci!

1162
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,355
It's just Gucci Gucci Gucci!

1163
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:18,296
She has skin caviar.
This stuff sells for $400 a jar.

1164
01:01:18,396 --> 01:01:20,216
I've heard of that. I want a try.
- Here.

1165
01:01:20,316 --> 01:01:22,136
Mm.
- Doesn't that smell good?

1166
01:01:22,236 --> 01:01:24,056
Ooh, hello.

1167
01:01:24,156 --> 01:01:26,040
What are these?

1168
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,344
Those are just her anti-anxiety pills.

1169
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:30,647
Ooh, these are good.
- Really?

1170
01:01:30,747 --> 01:01:32,984
They'd knock out a horse.
I have these at home.

1171
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:35,091
You do?
- Wait

1172
01:01:35,132 --> 01:01:38,327
I don't know what these are.
But they're definitely not what I take.

1173
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,088
They smell like oranges or something.

1174
01:01:40,188 --> 01:01:41,400
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1175
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,671
Let me see.

1176
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:49,174
Hi, Andy.
It's Charlie.

1177
01:01:49,212 --> 01:01:51,992
Now, I'm not working
for Dr. Batel's office this week.

1178
01:01:52,092 --> 01:01:55,096
But I had a question.
Yeah, about some pills.

1179
01:01:55,196 --> 01:01:56,696
Can I stop by?

1180
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:59,128
Charlie, I'm having a bit of a bad day,

1181
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:01,688
so Ruby's gonna take me
to see Dr. Chamberlain.

1182
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:04,439
Okay!
You take care!

1183
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:13,576
Let's see what you're up to.

1184
01:02:15,484 --> 01:02:17,400
There you go.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1185
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,800
And thank you.
- Wear that, sister.

1186
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,680
Okay, now Cartier is one right down.

1187
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,960
Where's Niketown?
- What?

1188
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:25,880
Niketown.
- Niketown?

1189
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,980
Bad day, my ass.

1190
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,206
Wait a minute.

1191
01:02:41,244 --> 01:02:43,927
Dr. Chamberlain?

1192
01:02:43,963 --> 01:02:46,484
All right.

1193
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,679
Hello?

1194
01:02:50,779 --> 01:02:52,599
Hey, Andy.

1195
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:55,995
What are they?

1196
01:02:56,028 --> 01:02:58,810
Chewable vitamin Cs, huh?

1197
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:01,048
Okay, thanks.

1198
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:12,632
I know. I can't believe
the wedding's only a week away.

1199
01:03:12,732 --> 01:03:15,128
No, we do the final
walk-through on Monday.

1200
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:18,713
Oh! Wait a minute.
I think I hear her car.

1201
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,648
Drop my stuff at my house, okay?

1202
01:03:22,748 --> 01:03:24,788
All right.
Look crazy.

1203
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,291
Charlie!

1204
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:45,879
Ch-ch-ch...

1205
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:47,800
Ch-ch-ahh...
Charlie!

1206
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,656
Oh, I had to bring him home with me today.

1207
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:51,927
He's harmless.

1208
01:03:51,963 --> 01:03:53,847
Sit. No!

1209
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:55,448
No. No.

1210
01:03:55,548 --> 01:03:57,687
No, Zorro! Sit!

1211
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:05,452
Is that expensive?

1212
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:09,931
It was.

1213
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:15,052
Sorry!

1214
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:27,436
Oh!

1215
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,244
Charlie!

1216
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:35,243
Bonus.

1217
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:38,618
Good boy.
Come on.

1218
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,651
Come on.

1219
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:46,325
Mmm.

1220
01:04:46,364 --> 01:04:48,698
Hello, old friend.

1221
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:50,968
Viola!

1222
01:04:51,004 --> 01:04:54,234
You can't mix alcohol with your pills!

1223
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,596
I'm a little upset...

1224
01:04:56,636 --> 01:04:58,456
as you can imagine.

1225
01:04:58,556 --> 01:04:59,735
Well, I know that...

1226
01:04:59,835 --> 01:05:01,976
and I'm sorry,
but your doctor said...

1227
01:05:02,076 --> 01:05:03,863
if you're feeling upset...

1228
01:05:03,963 --> 01:05:06,136
that you should take your pills, not alcohol.

1229
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:09,270
So you relax.
I'll get them.

1230
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:14,540
Shit.

1231
01:05:30,268 --> 01:05:31,928
Here we go.

1232
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,848
This will make you feel better.

1233
01:05:33,948 --> 01:05:35,948
Drink up.

1234
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,984
Now I hope you like what I made.

1235
01:05:41,084 --> 01:05:44,144
It's one of my mother's specialties.

1236
01:05:47,516 --> 01:05:50,298
What's that?
- Tripe.

1237
01:05:50,332 --> 01:05:52,633
It's a delicacy.

1238
01:05:52,668 --> 01:05:54,668
Try it.

1239
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:01,650
It's like nothing you've ever tasted.

1240
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,692
Trust me.

1241
01:06:08,476 --> 01:06:10,103
So Kevin called.

1242
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:11,960
He's coming home tomorrow.
I can't wait.

1243
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,559
I'm so excited.
I miss him so much.

1244
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:16,152
I was thinking maybe the three of us
could go to lunch tomorrow.

1245
01:06:16,252 --> 01:06:18,072
What do you think?

1246
01:06:18,172 --> 01:06:19,703
Yeah, I think it's a great idea too.

1247
01:06:19,803 --> 01:06:21,843
I'll make reservations.

1248
01:06:21,883 --> 01:06:23,988
It'll be so much fun.

1249
01:06:24,956 --> 01:06:28,186
Don't you just love being girlfriends?

1250
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:37,011
Night-night,
sleep tight.

1251
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,995
And good morning to you too.

1252
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:56,328
Ruby, is that you?
- In here!

1253
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:01,207
Oh my God.
Is she all right?

1254
01:07:01,307 --> 01:07:03,127
I thought she went to bed.

1255
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,176
I don't know.
I haven't seen her like this...

1256
01:07:05,276 --> 01:07:07,096
since 'The View' won an Emmy.

1257
01:07:07,196 --> 01:07:09,208
I wish I could stay and help...

1258
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:13,303
but I've got to go
pick up Kevin at the airport.

1259
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:17,303
What?

1260
01:07:17,403 --> 01:07:19,508
I underestimated you.

1261
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:21,555
You don't need a gun.

1262
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,615
I don't know what you're talking about.

1263
01:07:26,715 --> 01:07:28,715
Mm-hm.

1264
01:07:31,611 --> 01:07:33,611
Last call!

1265
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,743
We'll see you tomorrow night.

1266
01:07:38,843 --> 01:07:41,879
Uh, there's a reservation
under Fields, Kevin.

1267
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:43,447
Yes, right this way.

1268
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:46,327
I'm so glad my mom and you
had a great week.

1269
01:07:46,427 --> 01:07:48,535
We did. I learned a lot about her.

1270
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:50,930
So who's the mystery guest?

1271
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:54,071
Oh, surprise!

1272
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:56,952
I thought your office
said we were having lunch alone.

1273
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:59,480
Well, I hope you guys forgive me. I just...

1274
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:03,235
I wanted to talk to you and Kevin together.

1275
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:06,284
So how are you, Mom?

1276
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,120
Fine.

1277
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,929
Though I did have a rather difficult night.

1278
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,840
Ooh, it was probably that martini you had.

1279
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,951
Mom, you're not supposed
to be drink alcohol...

1280
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,511
with those pills you're taking.

1281
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:21,175
You know, the truth is

1282
01:08:21,275 --> 01:08:23,282
I owe you an apology.

1283
01:08:23,324 --> 01:08:26,327
You know, I was so insensitive
to your feelings...

1284
01:08:26,427 --> 01:08:28,024
about wanting to help with the wedding.

1285
01:08:28,124 --> 01:08:30,295
Oh, it's ancient history.

1286
01:08:30,331 --> 01:08:32,888
A young bride doesn't want to hear
the opinions of an old widow.

1287
01:08:32,988 --> 01:08:34,615
No no,
that is not true.

1288
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:38,030
I mean, you're going to be my mom soon.

1289
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:42,318
And a grandma shortly after, hopefully.

1290
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,447
And I want you to know
that I will do anything it takes...

1291
01:08:47,547 --> 01:08:50,182
to make this relationship work.

1292
01:08:51,483 --> 01:08:53,523
That said...

1293
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,447
will you be my maid...

1294
01:08:55,547 --> 01:08:57,623
I mean, my matron of honor?

1295
01:08:57,723 --> 01:09:00,625
Charlie, that's...
that's amazing.

1296
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,584
Mom, what do you say?
- But, uh...

1297
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,791
Morgan is gonna be your maid of honor.

1298
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:08,087
Oh no, she has graciously
relinquished her title to you.

1299
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:11,057
And I had this specially made up.

1300
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:14,499
A dress in your favorite color... peach.

1301
01:09:15,099 --> 01:09:17,240
Come on, open it.
- Well, that's...

1302
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,340
Char... ah.

1303
01:09:23,516 --> 01:09:25,752
I- I don't think I can.

1304
01:09:25,788 --> 01:09:27,671
Mom, I think it's a great idea.

1305
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:29,272
I just don't think I'm up to it.

1306
01:09:29,372 --> 01:09:31,351
I really don't. I've got to talk to my doctor.

1307
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:32,919
Oh, I called him.
Yeah!

1308
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:36,674
And he said he thought it was a great idea.

1309
01:09:36,859 --> 01:09:38,743
You called my psychiatrist?
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:41,745
In fact, we had lunch at The Ivy.

1311
01:09:41,787 --> 01:09:43,639
Well, anyway...

1312
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:46,904
he said, considering
this turning point in your life,

1313
01:09:47,004 --> 01:09:48,631
you know, losing so much so suddenly,

1314
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:50,167
that being involved in the future...

1315
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:52,727
would be the best therapy
in the world for you right now.

1316
01:09:52,827 --> 01:09:55,802
Careful. You know those are strong.

1317
01:09:55,803 --> 01:09:59,796
You know, we...
are your future.

1318
01:09:59,836 --> 01:10:02,641
And we want you to be part of it.

1319
01:10:03,772 --> 01:10:06,391
I can have a list of duties for you tomorrow.

1320
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:08,491
No.

1321
01:10:08,507 --> 01:10:11,125
M- mom... no, Mom.

1322
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:13,235
Mom, don't cry.

1323
01:10:13,276 --> 01:10:15,577
Here.

1324
01:10:18,076 --> 01:10:20,076
Charlie.

1325
01:10:21,595 --> 01:10:23,415
I didn't think I would be this emotional.

1326
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,015
Mom, here.
Can I?

1327
01:10:25,115 --> 01:10:27,155
Oh, oh!

1328
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:29,463
Oh, thank you, baby.
I love you.

1329
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,543
I love you too.
- I love you too!

1330
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:34,065
I love you too, Mom.

1331
01:10:34,107 --> 01:10:37,143
Kevin, you know what? Why don't you
give your mom and I a moment alone?

1332
01:10:37,243 --> 01:10:39,243
Yes, of course.

1333
01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:46,487
Just so you know,
the crying bits are getting old.

1334
01:10:46,587 --> 01:10:49,239
Just so you know,
Kevin likes his girls thin.

1335
01:10:49,339 --> 01:10:51,415
Oh! Well,
I can always get liposuction.

1336
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:53,335
I've been meaning to ask.
Is it painful?

1337
01:10:53,435 --> 01:10:55,737
That maid of honor bit.

1338
01:10:55,772 --> 01:10:57,431
Priceless!

1339
01:10:57,531 --> 01:11:00,824
You know what they say? Keep your
friends close, keep your enemies closer.

1340
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,542
Oh!
- Now you listen to me.

1341
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:05,399
This is my game now.

1342
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:08,439
You are going to tell Kevin that you
are not moving into our neighborhood,

1343
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:10,999
and that you've decided
that you're feeling like it's time...

1344
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,015
that you go on with your own life!

1345
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:15,480
You're moving out
of our house immediately.

1346
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,914
This is over!

1347
01:11:19,387 --> 01:11:20,759
Oh!

1348
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,950
This isn't over,
not even close, girlie!

1349
01:11:24,987 --> 01:11:27,197
Well, bring it on,
Grandma.

1350
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:30,519
That little bitch!

1351
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:34,583
Let's go someplace near
the ocean and drink lunch.

1352
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:36,055
What?

1353
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:38,155
You know exactly what.

1354
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,088
Move!

1355
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:42,188
Move! Move!

1356
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,536
What's wrong with you?

1357
01:11:44,636 --> 01:11:49,011
I am sick.
I am sick sick sick of your shit.

1358
01:11:49,051 --> 01:11:51,319
And I when I'm not sick,
I'm tired.

1359
01:11:51,419 --> 01:11:53,590
I am sick and tired.

1360
01:11:53,628 --> 01:11:55,668
What are you saying?

1361
01:11:55,707 --> 01:11:58,074
Damn you and your luggage!

1362
01:11:58,107 --> 01:12:00,375
Ruby, you're not going
to leave me too, are you?

1363
01:12:00,475 --> 01:12:03,126
No, I'm not leaving you!

1364
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:05,163
You old slut!

1365
01:12:06,235 --> 01:12:08,235
Ruby!

1366
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:13,336
Ruby, please...
- Hey, you almost forgot your dress!

1367
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:15,543
You'll have nothing to wear to the wedding.

1368
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:17,463
See you, Ruby!

1369
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:19,735
Maybe we can get you a matching bonnet.

1370
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,555
See you at the rehearsal dinner!

1371
01:12:28,379 --> 01:12:30,379
Motherf...!

1372
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,151
So, how's the bride-to-be holding up?

1373
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:43,448
Ooh, under the circumstances
I'd say mediocre. But she's tough.

1374
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:45,559
Not as tough as the old bird.

1375
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:48,119
What does that mean?
- For your own safety,

1376
01:12:48,219 --> 01:12:53,404
make sure you know where
the emergency exits are at all times.

1377
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:56,759
Hey, are you and my mom okay?

1378
01:12:56,859 --> 01:12:59,768
Great. Yeah, I just have a little
of the pre-wedding nerves,

1379
01:12:59,868 --> 01:13:01,367
but everything's under control.

1380
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,467
Of course.

1381
01:13:06,267 --> 01:13:08,087
Hello, everyone!

1382
01:13:08,187 --> 01:13:10,907
Welcome to the rehearsal dinner.

1383
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,799
My God, she looks amazing.
- I know.

1384
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:16,983
Oh!

1385
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:19,123
Father Tyson.

1386
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:21,530
Hello, Blaire.

1387
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,668
Kit, how are you?

1388
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:24,823
Hello, hello.

1389
01:13:24,923 --> 01:13:27,607
Oh, you are Morgan.
- Yes.

1390
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:30,327
I have heard so much about your delicious
catering service.

1391
01:13:30,427 --> 01:13:32,087
Oh! Oh, wow!

1392
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:35,383
I have a lot of friends.
You're going to be a busy girl.

1393
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:38,418
And you're Remy.
- Yeah.

1394
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:41,527
I recognize you from all the wonderful
things Charlie's told me about you.

1395
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:43,895
Wow. Well, Ms. Fields,
I have to say...

1396
01:13:43,995 --> 01:13:47,607
Oh, call me Viola. Please, I insist.
- Viola.

1397
01:13:47,707 --> 01:13:50,648
All right, I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Okay.

1398
01:13:50,748 --> 01:13:53,595
I'm such a huge fan.

1399
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:56,562
Oh, you...
- Oh, I...

1400
01:13:56,603 --> 01:13:59,319
Well, mi casa, su casa.
Make yourself at home.

1401
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:02,736
Thank you. Bye, Viola.
- Cheers.

1402
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:04,663
Goodbye.
- I like her a lot. Hi.

1403
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:06,583
Hey!
- Hi!

1404
01:14:06,683 --> 01:14:09,079
You guys have a nice little chit-chat? - Oh
my God. She came over...

1405
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:11,191
and started talking to us.
What did you want us to do?

1406
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:12,791
Ignore her?
- Yes!

1407
01:14:12,891 --> 01:14:18,756
So then getting her autograph
would be completely out of the question?

1408
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:22,839
Was that yes? 'Cause... okay.
- No.

1409
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:25,527
So there I was sitting next
to the Sultan of Brunei...

1410
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,567
with Maureen Dowd,
Carrie Fisher and Snoop Dogg.

1411
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:30,487
You know the story, Kevin.

1412
01:14:30,587 --> 01:14:32,471
I said to Snoop, 'Snoop,
I think your lyrics...

1413
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:35,319
are sometimes a little
sexist and unfair to women.'

1414
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:38,423
And the Sultan of Brunei said,
'Really? I have 114 wives...

1415
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:41,838
and they're all huge fans of the Dogg!'

1416
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:49,367
Honey, would you see who's at the door?

1417
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,467
Sure.

1418
01:14:52,539 --> 01:14:54,007
These are delicious, Viola.

1419
01:14:54,107 --> 01:14:55,927
Oh, Kit,
I'm glad you like it.

1420
01:14:56,027 --> 01:14:57,783
Mm, yeah.

1421
01:14:57,883 --> 01:14:59,351
Look who's here.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1422
01:14:59,451 --> 01:15:02,648
Oh my God!
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1423
01:15:02,683 --> 01:15:05,975
Hi! Everybody, it's Dr. Chamberlain!
- Hi. Good evening.

1424
01:15:06,075 --> 01:15:08,503
Thanks so much for inviting me.
- Oh, shit!

1425
01:15:08,603 --> 01:15:11,191
That's Dr. Chamberlain.
He's Viola's doctor.

1426
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,015
Oh, we're going to need
another place setting.

1427
01:15:13,115 --> 01:15:14,679
Oh, please,
let me get that.

1428
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,919
There's a chair in the living room.
- Sure.

1429
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:19,639
Scootch down, you guys.
Come on, make room.

1430
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:21,463
You guys move down.

1431
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:23,383
Cheers. Thank you.

1432
01:15:23,483 --> 01:15:24,535
Who's he?

1433
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:27,639
It's Viola's therapist.
Move down, you guys!

1434
01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:30,586
Excuse me.
- No problem.

1435
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:33,719
Here's you chair, Doctor.
- Here. Have mine, too.

1436
01:15:33,819 --> 01:15:35,511
Hello.

1437
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:36,631
Hi.

1438
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:38,731
Hi.
- Hi.

1439
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:42,327
I'll get it.

1440
01:15:42,427 --> 01:15:44,663
So you just got here?

1441
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:46,039
Are you expecting anyone else?
- Huh-uh.

1442
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:48,594
Hello, everybody!
- Fiona!

1443
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:50,635
I'm so glad to see you.

1444
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:53,207
I just couldn't resist
bringing the happy couple...

1445
01:15:53,307 --> 01:15:55,127
a little gift.

1446
01:15:55,227 --> 01:15:58,263
That's great. I will get you a place setting.

1447
01:15:58,363 --> 01:16:00,599
She's bringing a gift?
I think she is the gift.

1448
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:02,583
What the hell is she doing here?

1449
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,719
How about some more wine, everyone?
- Yeah!

1450
01:16:05,819 --> 01:16:08,407
How much longer do we have to stay?
I have midterms tomorrow.

1451
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:09,911
Shh.

1452
01:16:10,011 --> 01:16:12,599
Oh, I get it.
- No, baby, not now, okay?

1453
01:16:12,699 --> 01:16:14,583
It's not the time.

1454
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:16,822
So, Dr. Chamberlain,

1455
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:19,415
tell us about med school.
Where did you do your residency?

1456
01:16:19,515 --> 01:16:21,719
Uh, now that's...
that's a long story.

1457
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:23,255
I don't think your guests want to hear that.

1458
01:16:23,355 --> 01:16:24,471
No, we really want to know.

1459
01:16:24,571 --> 01:16:27,291
I think we need some more gravy.

1460
01:16:31,419 --> 01:16:33,239
What is going on?

1461
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:35,127
What are you doing?

1462
01:16:35,227 --> 01:16:37,227
I'm behaving.

1463
01:16:37,243 --> 01:16:38,423
Viola, no!

1464
01:16:38,523 --> 01:16:40,855
You can't!
Charlie's allergic to nuts!

1465
01:16:40,955 --> 01:16:42,955
Give it to me!

1466
01:16:48,795 --> 01:16:50,835
Viola, you're crazy.

1467
01:16:55,579 --> 01:16:56,695
Oh, get up.

1468
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:59,863
Put the gravy down or I'm telling Kevin.

1469
01:16:59,963 --> 01:17:01,963
Yeah!

1470
01:17:02,971 --> 01:17:05,271
What's the big deal?
So her face swells up...

1471
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,127
swells up a little.
So what?

1472
01:17:07,227 --> 01:17:10,135
Swells up a little? Her face'll
blow up like a Macy's Day balloon.

1473
01:17:10,235 --> 01:17:12,375
Well, good. It'll match the other body parts!

1474
01:17:12,475 --> 01:17:15,704
Viola, think about what you're doing.

1475
01:17:15,738 --> 01:17:17,847
Come on, the girl's
getting married tomorrow!

1476
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,478
Ruby, when did you lose your edge?

1477
01:17:19,578 --> 01:17:21,079
Right after you lost your mind.

1478
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,318
Come on.

1479
01:17:23,355 --> 01:17:24,823
All right. Okay.
No nuts.

1480
01:17:24,923 --> 01:17:26,295
Come on.

1481
01:17:26,395 --> 01:17:28,599
Viola, I think you dislocated my vagina.

1482
01:17:28,699 --> 01:17:30,519
Where's the...
- Where's the what?

1483
01:17:30,619 --> 01:17:31,799
Gravy? More gravy?

1484
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:33,719
Anyone for more gravy?

1485
01:17:33,819 --> 01:17:36,721
Oh, I am not doing time for you!

1486
01:17:36,763 --> 01:17:38,711
Where's the back door?
- Stay cool, Ruby!

1487
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:40,215
Stay cool! This is no time
to lose your nerve.

1488
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:42,166
If I get arrested
I'm gonna sing like a canary.

1489
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,182
Maybe she won't take any gravy.

1490
01:17:44,282 --> 01:17:46,327
That's a lot of gravy.
- Mmm!

1491
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:48,532
This gravy's delicious!

1492
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:51,479
You... you gotta go stop her!

1493
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:54,455
Go on, stop her. Go stop her.
- You go, you go, you go.

1494
01:17:54,555 --> 01:17:56,215
Why me?
You're the culprit? You go!

1495
01:17:56,315 --> 01:17:58,775
You're my assistant.
- What am I supposed to do?

1496
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,471
Go out there and stick my finger
down her throat?

1497
01:18:00,571 --> 01:18:02,571
Yeah.

1498
01:18:03,386 --> 01:18:04,598
Baby, are you okay?

1499
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:06,903
Kevin, my tongue feels weird.

1500
01:18:07,003 --> 01:18:08,471
I think something's wrong!

1501
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,167
Charlie, are you okay?

1502
01:18:10,267 --> 01:18:14,177
What are we gonna do now?
- Hide the damn nuts!

1503
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,798
Are you all right?
- Get her some water.

1504
01:18:21,722 --> 01:18:24,308
Flat or sparkling?

1505
01:18:24,347 --> 01:18:26,807
The caterer says he doesn't know how
this could have happened.

1506
01:18:26,907 --> 01:18:29,814
Well, I feel like I ate a loaf of nuts.

1507
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:32,804
I mean, even my tongue is swollen.

1508
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:37,921
You're marrying
a big, fat, puffy tomato mouth.

1509
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,423
It's not that bad, really. Besides,
the swelling's already going down.

1510
01:18:42,523 --> 01:18:44,628
Yeah?
- Hey, Kev.

1511
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,134
Yeah.
- Just coming to check up...

1512
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:48,054
on the bride-to-be.
For the love of God...

1513
01:18:48,154 --> 01:18:50,293
Out!
- You see?

1514
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:52,375
I told you it looks terrible.

1515
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:54,199
I told you.
- Baby, I promise you.

1516
01:18:54,299 --> 01:18:56,631
In 24 hours the swelling
will be completely gone.

1517
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:58,731
Give me that!

1518
01:19:22,362 --> 01:19:23,863
Door was open.

1519
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:26,865
Oh thank God.

1520
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:29,527
The Bride of Frankenstein is gone.
- I know.

1521
01:19:29,627 --> 01:19:31,606
I was up half the night worrying.

1522
01:19:31,706 --> 01:19:33,815
You look great.
- I just don't know...

1523
01:19:33,915 --> 01:19:35,831
how those nuts got in there.
- Yeah.

1524
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:38,451
Hmm.
Wait.

1525
01:19:38,491 --> 01:19:41,041
Hey, do you think she would...

1526
01:19:42,715 --> 01:19:44,279
No!

1527
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,750
Come on.

1528
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,574
I mean, she's crazy,

1529
01:19:47,674 --> 01:19:49,815
but she's not like,
psycho-killer crazy.

1530
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:51,915
Hmm.

1531
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,570
No!

1532
01:19:55,899 --> 01:19:59,127
Oh, hey, I was wondering.
Could I bring a date...

1533
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,047
to your wedding?

1534
01:20:01,147 --> 01:20:03,479
Of course. My God.
How exciting.

1535
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:05,814
Great. Thanks.
So then, I'll see you later.

1536
01:20:05,914 --> 01:20:07,382
But... w-wait!

1537
01:20:07,482 --> 01:20:09,463
Who is he? Tell me!
- Oh, it's...

1538
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:12,567
okay, don't be mad.
It's Dr. Chamberlain.

1539
01:20:12,667 --> 01:20:14,487
Actually 'Paul.'

1540
01:20:14,587 --> 01:20:17,238
Is that his real name?
- That's very funny.

1541
01:20:17,338 --> 01:20:19,158
I gotta go get a mani, pedi
and my eyebrows waxed.

1542
01:20:19,258 --> 01:20:21,815
But I'll see you in a couple hours, okay?

1543
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:23,159
Oh, let me go down with you.
- Okay.

1544
01:20:23,259 --> 01:20:25,259
Oh God.

1545
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:31,638
She added even more ruffles!

1546
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:34,458
Where's your prom date,
señorita?

1547
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:38,806
Oh, wait a minute. This is too
damn good. Where's my camera?

1548
01:20:38,906 --> 01:20:40,278
This is just too good.

1549
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:43,095
Will you just get me out of this right now?

1550
01:20:43,195 --> 01:20:45,195
Come here.

1551
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,819
Cheers.
- Hey.

1552
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:06,519
Thanks for coming.

1553
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:08,887
Okay, guys, let's go see
how Charlie's doing.

1554
01:21:08,987 --> 01:21:10,994
Ah, yes, please.

1555
01:21:11,035 --> 01:21:12,502
Uh-huh.

1556
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:16,427
Oh my God. Those are
so much better than mine.

1557
01:21:21,275 --> 01:21:24,122
Don't... touch me!

1558
01:21:24,155 --> 01:21:26,679
I got out of that car
the same way I got in it...

1559
01:21:26,779 --> 01:21:30,292
without you.
Now where is she?

1560
01:21:36,731 --> 01:21:38,551
You here with the bride or the groom?

1561
01:21:38,651 --> 01:21:40,471
I'm here with my mother.

1562
01:21:40,571 --> 01:21:42,571
Oh.

1563
01:21:46,427 --> 01:21:48,807
She looked a lot older. L...

1564
01:21:51,258 --> 01:21:53,207
Well, look what we have here.

1565
01:21:53,307 --> 01:21:55,307
Oh my God.

1566
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:58,327
You look beautiful.
Oh my God.

1567
01:21:58,427 --> 01:22:00,310
Oh my God.
- This is it!

1568
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:02,167
Yeah!

1569
01:22:02,267 --> 01:22:04,502
Oh God, did you talk to the priest?
- I talked to him.

1570
01:22:04,602 --> 01:22:06,582
He's just going to skip
right over that whole...

1571
01:22:06,682 --> 01:22:08,631
'if anyone should object' part.
- Okay.

1572
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:12,055
You're a vision in white,
sweetie, really.

1573
01:22:12,155 --> 01:22:15,602
Knock knock.
Look at you!

1574
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:19,255
And so is your mother-in-law.

1575
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:21,298
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

1576
01:22:22,394 --> 01:22:24,434
All right.
Everybody out.

1577
01:22:24,443 --> 01:22:26,823
Out.
Give the bride a moment.

1578
01:22:29,435 --> 01:22:32,086
No way.
- What?

1579
01:22:37,467 --> 01:22:39,095
What is that?

1580
01:22:39,195 --> 01:22:41,719
What?
- Where's your bridesmaid's dress?

1581
01:22:41,819 --> 01:22:44,055
Oh, I gave it to Ruby's daughter.

1582
01:22:44,155 --> 01:22:45,942
She works at Hooters.
She was thrilled.

1583
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:47,958
I don't have a daughter?

1584
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:49,559
Oh.

1585
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,659
Rude.

1586
01:22:52,795 --> 01:22:54,711
Take off that white dress right now...

1587
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:58,040
or I'll take it off for you.

1588
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:00,246
Don't you tell me what to do!

1589
01:23:00,346 --> 01:23:03,129
You did not just poke me!

1590
01:23:03,162 --> 01:23:06,307
Don't you touch me,
you two-bit tramp!

1591
01:23:07,706 --> 01:23:09,559
Oh my God!
Viola, I'm so sorry.

1592
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:12,179
I didn't mean to...

1593
01:23:12,218 --> 01:23:14,295
You don't go and slap somebody
then apologize.

1594
01:23:14,395 --> 01:23:16,395
Get some backbone!

1595
01:23:21,979 --> 01:23:24,084
God! This is crazy!

1596
01:23:24,122 --> 01:23:25,687
Why don't you just face it?

1597
01:23:25,787 --> 01:23:28,055
I'm marrying Kevin today and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1598
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:31,062
You face it! You'll never be
good enough for him!

1599
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:33,622
Didn't stop you from marrying my son.

1600
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:37,137
Oh God, no.
- Well, look at you.

1601
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,998
All in white.

1602
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:41,554
You are so predictable.

1603
01:23:41,595 --> 01:23:44,215
Oh, Gertrude.
I didn't know you were coming.

1604
01:23:44,315 --> 01:23:45,431
You didn't?

1605
01:23:45,531 --> 01:23:48,400
Wonder why.
Oh, I know.

1606
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:51,095
You didn't send me an invitation!

1607
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:52,503
I thought you were dead.

1608
01:23:52,603 --> 01:23:54,454
But evil doesn't die so easily.

1609
01:23:54,554 --> 01:23:57,303
I heard you got sacked
and thrown into a loony bin.

1610
01:23:57,403 --> 01:23:59,542
Oh! Oh!
- My congratulations.

1611
01:23:59,642 --> 01:24:01,334
Oh my God.

1612
01:24:01,434 --> 01:24:03,254
Oh my God!

1613
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:06,924
These hors d'oeuvres taste like old socks.

1614
01:24:07,419 --> 01:24:09,206
Now, I want to get...

1615
01:24:09,306 --> 01:24:11,286
an up-close look at the bride.

1616
01:24:11,386 --> 01:24:12,886
Holy Toledo!

1617
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:15,953
You are a stunner!

1618
01:24:15,995 --> 01:24:18,006
My grandson is a lucky fellah.

1619
01:24:18,106 --> 01:24:19,287
Look, what he did.

1620
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:23,794
He went out and found
himself an exotic Latina!

1621
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:27,030
Would that my son had been that lucky.

1622
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:28,695
Here we go again.

1623
01:24:28,795 --> 01:24:31,671
What? You were
a television weatherwoman...

1624
01:24:31,771 --> 01:24:32,950
in Dubuque, Montana.

1625
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:35,286
You drove around
in a broken-down minivan...

1626
01:24:35,386 --> 01:24:38,550
and you drank red wine from a box!

1627
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:42,487
Classy.

1628
01:24:42,587 --> 01:24:44,407
You killed him,
you know?

1629
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:46,327
What? !
- You killed him.

1630
01:24:46,427 --> 01:24:48,247
All the doctors agreed,

1631
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:51,729
my son died of terminal disappointment!

1632
01:24:51,771 --> 01:24:53,751
If anybody killed him,
you did.

1633
01:24:53,851 --> 01:24:55,478
You smothered him to death!

1634
01:24:55,578 --> 01:24:58,638
Nobody was ever good enough for him!

1635
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:01,259
My God, you look old!

1636
01:25:02,874 --> 01:25:04,374
Fine.

1637
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:07,191
This woman is going to drive me insane.

1638
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:10,691
Now, I'd rather not take all the credit.

1639
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,234
You'll get over it.

1640
01:25:18,234 --> 01:25:21,124
Okay, I love you.
- You're kidding.

1641
01:25:33,498 --> 01:25:35,895
This is never gonna end, is it?

1642
01:25:35,995 --> 01:25:39,158
I mean, that's going
to be me and you in 30 years.

1643
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:42,318
We'll be doing the exact same thing.

1644
01:25:45,114 --> 01:25:47,114
You know what?

1645
01:25:48,763 --> 01:25:51,990
I wanted to marry Kevin
because we make each other happy.

1646
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,902
But you're never gonna let that happen.

1647
01:25:55,002 --> 01:25:57,002
Are you?

1648
01:25:59,194 --> 01:26:02,764
Oh my God.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

1649
01:26:06,682 --> 01:26:08,787
You win, Viola.

1650
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:11,959
What do you mean?

1651
01:26:12,059 --> 01:26:14,059
The wedding's off.

1652
01:26:15,099 --> 01:26:17,099
Bye, Ruby.

1653
01:26:19,962 --> 01:26:22,646
I- I cannot believe
she compared me to Gertrude.

1654
01:26:22,746 --> 01:26:25,594
I know.
Now that's just wrong.

1655
01:26:25,626 --> 01:26:28,176
Thank you.
- You are far worse.

1656
01:26:28,187 --> 01:26:31,286
I don't recall Gertrude
ever trying to poison you.

1657
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,687
And I'm pretty sure
she wore black to your wedding.

1658
01:26:33,787 --> 01:26:35,926
Black. Yeah, she said she was in mourning.

1659
01:26:36,026 --> 01:26:37,750
Mm-hmm.

1660
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,311
I just want my son to be happy.

1661
01:26:40,411 --> 01:26:43,313
Whatever made you think he wasn't?

1662
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:53,622
Hey, what are you doing here?

1663
01:26:53,722 --> 01:26:56,279
Don't you know it's bad luck to see the...

1664
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,379
Charlie, what's wrong?

1665
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:02,391
What is it?

1666
01:27:02,491 --> 01:27:03,959
Are you nervous?

1667
01:27:04,059 --> 01:27:06,059
Hey.

1668
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:10,038
Kevin, I need...
- Charlie,

1669
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,022
I need to talk to you.

1670
01:27:12,122 --> 01:27:14,934
Viola, stop it!
- It's the flower girls.

1671
01:27:15,034 --> 01:27:17,936
They're drunk again.
- What?

1672
01:27:17,978 --> 01:27:19,510
Yeah, in the toilet.

1673
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,142
Not now, Viola, okay?

1674
01:27:21,242 --> 01:27:22,807
It's really important.

1675
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:26,647
Just give us a minute.
She'll be right there.

1676
01:27:26,906 --> 01:27:28,726
Please?

1677
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,826
Charlie, what is it?

1678
01:27:35,035 --> 01:27:37,035
I'll be right back.

1679
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:44,050
What do you want, Viola?

1680
01:27:45,658 --> 01:27:48,022
I don't want you
to walk out on this wedding.

1681
01:27:48,122 --> 01:27:49,558
You don't?

1682
01:27:49,658 --> 01:27:51,862
No, I don't.

1683
01:27:51,898 --> 01:27:54,358
What, am I supposed to believe
that you've had some epiphany?

1684
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:56,855
That all of the sudden,
everything is going to be different?

1685
01:27:56,955 --> 01:27:58,806
It's never been about you, Charlie.

1686
01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:00,662
It's me.

1687
01:28:00,762 --> 01:28:02,550
I've been so afraid of losing him.

1688
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,822
He's the only family I've got.

1689
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:09,200
This is my chance for a family, too.

1690
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,094
And I'm scared.
- Oh!

1691
01:28:11,194 --> 01:28:13,398
Don't blow your chance for happiness.

1692
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:15,255
You've never needed my approval.

1693
01:28:15,355 --> 01:28:18,670
He's loved you from the very beginning.

1694
01:28:18,778 --> 01:28:21,558
And I promise I will get out of the way...

1695
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:22,998
and let the two of you be happy.

1696
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:25,170
That's not what I want.

1697
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:28,470
I mean, there just has
to be some boundaries, Viola.

1698
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,570
I can do boundaries!

1699
01:28:31,419 --> 01:28:34,518
I don't love boundaries but I can do them.

1700
01:28:34,618 --> 01:28:37,783
How about the number of times
you call Kevin a day?

1701
01:28:37,883 --> 01:28:39,862
Can we limit that to, like, one?

1702
01:28:39,962 --> 01:28:42,929
Oh, I need at least four minimum.

1703
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:45,078
He's 35 years old.
- Three?

1704
01:28:45,178 --> 01:28:47,062
Two.
- Deal.

1705
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:50,064
Two long-ass calls!

1706
01:28:50,106 --> 01:28:52,054
When Kevin and I have kids,

1707
01:28:52,154 --> 01:28:54,230
he and I will decide how they're raised.

1708
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,270
All right. But you know I have
raised one wonderful boy.

1709
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,894
And my advice could be very...
- Will be solicited when needed.

1710
01:28:59,994 --> 01:29:02,743
All right, as long as one kid
is named after me.

1711
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:05,625
Middle name.
- Deal.

1712
01:29:05,658 --> 01:29:06,966
What else?

1713
01:29:07,066 --> 01:29:09,398
Holidays and special occasions.

1714
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:11,793
Are you gonna keep me away?

1715
01:29:11,802 --> 01:29:15,893
You must be present for every Christmas,

1716
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:19,226
Thanksgiving,
birthday,

1717
01:29:19,258 --> 01:29:22,193
school play,
clarinet recital...

1718
01:29:22,234 --> 01:29:25,463
and soccer game in our kids' lives.

1719
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,014
I want you to love them and spoil them...

1720
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:32,438
and teach them things
that Kevin and I can't.

1721
01:29:32,538 --> 01:29:36,193
Like how to throw a right hook for example.

1722
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,670
I want you there, Viola.

1723
01:29:39,770 --> 01:29:42,705
I do, up front and center.

1724
01:29:44,506 --> 01:29:47,318
From this point I will not negotiate.

1725
01:29:47,418 --> 01:29:51,243
Damn. That girl can give
a nice little speech.

1726
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:54,538
Deal?

1727
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:57,046
Oh...

1728
01:29:57,146 --> 01:29:59,574
can they call me 'Aunt Viola'
instead of 'Grandma'?

1729
01:29:59,674 --> 01:30:02,227
Fine.

1730
01:30:11,706 --> 01:30:14,008
Come on, unzip me.

1731
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:17,462
Viola, you don't
have to wear that dress, really.

1732
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:19,570
Yes, I do. Really.

1733
01:30:24,026 --> 01:30:26,328
Go, Kevin and Charlie!

1734
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,250
Yeah!

1735
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,606
Mom!

1736
01:30:51,642 --> 01:30:55,670
Do you really think I would leave without
saying goodbye?

1737
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,810
I love you, Mom.

1738
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:00,151
Thanks for everything.
- Go.

1739
01:31:01,338 --> 01:31:03,338
Bye, you guys!

1740
01:31:04,826 --> 01:31:08,310
Okay, everybody gather around
the back of the car!

1741
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:10,294
Charlie!

1742
01:31:10,394 --> 01:31:13,794
Charlie, right here!
Right here, Charlie!

1743
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:32,598
Sheesh.

1744
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:37,033
Oh, Hawaii! I cannot wait!
- I know. I can't either.

1745
01:31:37,946 --> 01:31:39,190
Have a great time in Hawaii!

1746
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:41,925
Good luck!
- Have fun in Hawaii!

1747
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,478
Just you and me now, Ruby!

1748
01:31:47,578 --> 01:31:51,571
Jesus. Who did I kill in a past life?

1749
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,750
And take off that damn dress.

1750
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,286
You look like a giant peach cobbler.

1751
01:31:55,386 --> 01:31:57,174
You're making me hungry.

1752
01:31:57,274 --> 01:32:01,354
Come on, weathergirl,
I'll buy you a box of wine.

1753
01:36:54,906 --> 01:36:57,775
Gettin' old.

1754
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,149
