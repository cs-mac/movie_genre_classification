1
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,307
This is the conclusive Kidnap andRansom
Report for Mr. Pierre Lenoir.

2
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,575
Location: Chechnya.

3
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:00,670
Result:

4
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:01,902
Positive.

5
00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:05,036
We were contracted by AGP underwriters
who insured the victim.

6
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:11,770
Mr. Lenoir was abducted January 21
from Russian-held territory...

7
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:14,642
...by members ofthe Chechen
Nationalist Militia.

8
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:19,771
Their first demand was for $5million.

9
00:01:22,613 --> 00:01:25,239
My ability to negotiate directly
with the Chechens...

10
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:27,802
...was subverted
by Russian military command...

11
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,869
...who monitoredmy every move.

12
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,536
After 36 days...

13
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:37,272
...lhadnegotiated the finalransom figure
down to $750,000.

14
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:43,078
Finalproofoflife was received
midnight Wednesday, February 27.

15
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,213
The next morning,
l was informedby the Russians...

16
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:55,146
...that l wouldbeprohibited
from personally delivering the ransom.

17
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:02,275
Any confidence that these men
would deliver the ransom money...

18
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:06,212
...andreturn the hostage safely, had,
by this point, been dissipated.

19
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:07,745
Tell your colonel...

20
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,803
...it's his responsibility now.

21
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:12,279
He's got his orders. He fucks about...

22
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:14,743
...l'll be the least of his problems.

23
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:24,036
Factoring the time-sensitive interests
of the group holding Lenoir...

24
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:27,172
...the limited communication available
with the London office...

25
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,908
...and the Russian insistence...

26
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,175
...that they, and they alone,
deliver the ransom payment.

27
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:36,280
lmade the decision
that there was simply no alternative...

28
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,315
...but to give the Russians
exactly what they wanted.

29
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:50,074
Knowing that l'dretain possession
ofthe ransom money...

30
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,581
...l'dmanaged to contact
the Chechens privately.

31
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,707
We hadagreed to rendezvous
at an alternative location.

32
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,971
Transport options in this area are limited.

33
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:01,244
Drive!

34
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,305
So l did the best that l could.

35
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,176
The group holding Mr. Lenoir...

36
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:10,977
...was responsible for a dozen kidnappings
over thepast two years.

37
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,377
This is a battle-testedguerrilla militia.

38
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,075
They are well-armed,
highly mobile and extremely unpredictable.

39
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,079
Mr. Lenoir was found to be
in an excellent state ofhealth...

40
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,241
...considering the circumstances.

41
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,447
l sent the Russians away.
l don't know how much time we've got.

42
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,772
Following a review ofthe ransom payment.

43
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,745
Mr. Lenoir was released into our care.

44
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:48,911
The success ofthis extraction depended on
a brisk, timely, transfer schedule.

45
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:52,806
We were, however, not quite fast enough.

46
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:00,941
Airborne!

47
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:04,282
Come in hot, Joe. This place is going loud!

48
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,109
Evac emergency RV. Repeat, ERV.

49
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:31,879
Airborne, l have a visual!

50
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:35,942
There are two dead trees
in the center of the field.

51
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,849
l'm 50 yards to the west of the south tree.

52
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:43,013
Don't give me any shit, Joseph.
l've got injured cargo. Get your ass down!

53
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:10,983
Go!

54
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:41,781
This extraction didn't go down well
for the Chechens or our Russian hosts.

55
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,611
As a result...

56
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,308
...my ability to function as a Kidnap
andRansom consultant in the area...

57
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:48,943
...has been permanently compromised.

58
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:52,183
Mr. Lenoir was examined
by mobile medical...

59
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,481
...and as per
his insurance company's request...

60
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,782
...transported to Athens yesterday
for surgical treatment.

61
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:01,509
At this time, we have contracts
with all three insurance underwriters...

62
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:05,349
...holding K and R policies
in the west-Asian, post-Soviet republics.

63
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,949
This area is clearly
in a critical state of transition...

64
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,287
...and demands
the most vigorous security precautions.

65
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:14,979
What did they bill last year,
our three underwriters?

66
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,350
Total premium?

67
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:19,547
-$28 million.
-And the ransom total?

68
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,587
Paid out on policies?

69
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:22,779
$26 million.

70
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:24,046
Bloody hell.

71
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:28,142
Set up some premium meetings.
Wave the red flag a bit.

72
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,412
Excellent job, Terry. Thank you.

73
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,111
As always, outstanding.

74
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:33,151
Sir.

75
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,545
Where are we next? Pakistan?

76
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:38,580
Colombia?

77
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,256
Hello.

78
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,022
Peter, is that you?

79
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:31,451
Baby, it's me.

80
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:33,454
Can you hear me? lt's about tonight.

81
00:07:33,522 --> 00:07:35,216
l'm shopping for dinner.

82
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,715
The goodnews is, l'll definitely be back.

83
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,449
Yeah? Go on.

84
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:43,311
We've got to go to this thing tonight.
The dinner. The charity event.

85
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,185
You're kidding, right?

86
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,620
No. l'm getting completely screwedhere.

87
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,087
None ofmy equipment's here.
None ofthe stufftheypromised.

88
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:55,316
l've got 60 guys running around thejungle
with nothing to do.

89
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,250
Something is really messed up here.

90
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:59,346
l'm going to pin
these bastards down tonight.

91
00:07:59,423 --> 00:08:03,015
You really want to put me
at a table full of oil executives?

92
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,652
They're big boys. They can stand up
to a little hippie like you.

93
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:10,649
Can l tell them what l think of them?

94
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,917
lf you really want to skip it--

95
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,547
No, l'll go, l'll be there.

96
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,551
And l'll be on my best behavior.

97
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,956
Great.

98
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,320
Thank you, Alice. l mean it.

99
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,482
l'llhave to borrow a dress from Norma.

100
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:30,456
Get Sandro to drop my tux by the airfield
before he stops back andpicks you up.

101
00:08:30,524 --> 00:08:32,513
Yeah, don't worry about it.

102
00:08:32,591 --> 00:08:35,819
Please don't leave me hanging out there
with thosepeople.

103
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,218
Andbe careful.

104
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,780
l will. l love you.

105
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,281
Peter, what's happening?
What about the equipment?

106
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:52,914
Everything is taken care of.

107
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,389
l'm meeting with the guys
from Quad Carbon tonight.

108
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:06,384
His mom said
he was exactly the same as a baby.

109
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,082
She's right, you know.

110
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:09,282
Hey, baby.

111
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,285
l was worried about you.

112
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,951
-l told you he'd make it.
-Hi, Peter.

113
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,951
-Let's find our tables.
-We'll see you inside.

114
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,220
Look at you,
all decked out in Norma's duds.

115
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,417
lt's my debut as a corporate wife.

116
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,023
Whatever it is...

117
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,822
...it is working.

118
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,819
l'm dressing like this all the time now.
You ought to come around more often.

119
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,987
-l guess l got some making up to do.
-l guess so.

120
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,356
l just want to know
what the hell is going on.

121
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,950
-Nobody called?
-No.

122
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:44,516
l was there all day.

123
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,017
Hey, y'all. Sorry we're late.

124
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,750
-Where is everybody?
-Nobody called you?

125
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,315
Are you shitting me?

126
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:55,382
Fellner, Buddy and their gang left
for Houston this morning. A powwow.

127
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,950
Peggy said if he was going, she was going.
l guess all the girls jumped on that.

128
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,425
So, it's just us.

129
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,287
Better late than never.

130
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:06,750
So, lvy tell you?

131
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,049
Houston.

132
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:11,558
This morning. All of them.
Fellner chartered a plane.

133
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:12,923
What's in Houston?

134
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:14,085
New money.

135
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,325
Peter, look.

136
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:40,194
How did it get so bad so fast?

137
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,091
Come on, man.

138
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:44,122
Where the hell have you been?

139
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:46,093
l've been trying to build a dam.

140
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:48,992
Pick your head up every now and then,
take a look around.

141
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:51,358
You're building a charity water project.

142
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:54,952
As for the company, you're nothing
but a humanitarian window-dressing.

143
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,723
Quad Carbon came down here looking
for a lucky break and we got nailed.

144
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,291
We've a billion-dollar pipeline
that hasn't spit out a gallon yet.

145
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:06,089
Oil prices are going through the roof.
We can't take advantage of it.

146
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,387
You know, market close today...

147
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,951
...Quad Carbon stock down $10 and falling.

148
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,753
The vultures are circling.

149
00:12:16,296 --> 00:12:18,126
Which vulture is in Houston?

150
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,489
lt's Octonal.

151
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:23,062
They're the only ones big enough
to come and get this thing on track.

152
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,527
Peter, look!

153
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,588
Peter, look!

154
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,862
Maybe you missed it,
but this happens to be a big deal for me.

155
00:12:42,564 --> 00:12:44,029
l think l know that.

156
00:12:45,196 --> 00:12:47,059
You sure don't act like it.

157
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:51,285
Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's just a sign
that we should go home.

158
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:55,659
You tell me. This all falls apart,
this goes away, what was the point?

159
00:12:56,363 --> 00:13:00,023
-The point of what?
-l don't know. How about everything?

160
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:03,695
How about Africa? How about Egypt?
How about Thailand?

161
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,727
How about eight years of shit postings?
Eight years of working for assholes.

162
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,592
Eight years of working
on somebody else's bad ideas.

163
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:12,720
Wait. l don't get it here.

164
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,995
Suddenly the last eight years,
that's just all shit now?

165
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:17,859
-ls that what l said?
-l thought...

166
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,897
...we were doing what we wanted to do.

167
00:13:19,964 --> 00:13:21,987
l thought we were living our lives together.

168
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,690
That's not what l said.
This isn't just a job!

169
00:13:24,997 --> 00:13:28,430
This is everything
l have prepared for my entire life!

170
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:34,896
lf Jerry's right, if it's Octonal, they come in
and take this over, l'm fucked!

171
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,423
l wouldn't get too upset about it.

172
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:42,188
Maybe Octonal wants a dam
of their very own.

173
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,355
Octonal doesn't build dams, they kick ass.

174
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,159
They don't care about these people.
lt's all about profits.

175
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:51,494
l don't get it. What is the surprise here?
You wanted to work for an oil company.

176
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,555
l don't work for an oil company.
That's not what l'm doing here!

177
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:56,824
l'm building a dam
that will save people's lives!

178
00:13:56,898 --> 00:14:01,263
You are building a dam so an oil company
can get a pipeline contract.

179
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,161
-Who cares who pays for it?
-Apparently, no one!

180
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:08,428
You're drunk.

181
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,656
No, Peter.

182
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,458
This isn't us.

183
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,123
-Let's just go home.
-Great.

184
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:19,426
That is so supportive.

185
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,223
You don't like this place either.

186
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,561
-l like the project.
-l don't have a project!

187
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,928
Then find a fucking project!

188
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,857
Damn.

189
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,328
Use your talent, your experience.

190
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:40,430
There's got to be 25 agencies
working down here.

191
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,761
There's food projects, health-care projects.

192
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:46,026
Any one of them would be thrilled
to have you on their staff.

193
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,630
l don't get this.

194
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,661
You've hit the ground running
every place we've ever gone.

195
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:53,790
l'm sorry l'm not bouncing back
fast enough for you.

196
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,591
Five months here, you haven't even started
to learn the language.

197
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,594
l am not getting pregnant again
in the Third World.

198
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,360
No, not Africa.

199
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,430
We're not gonna bring that into this.

200
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,593
-''That''?
-Yes, that.

201
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,262
When the hell are you gonna move on?
lt's over. lt happened.

202
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:15,391
-lt wasn't meant to be. Get over it!
-l don't want to move on!

203
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,398
Well, l have. And goddamn it,
l'm right here. Right now.

204
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:24,527
My whole situation is falling apart
and somehow, we're back to this agenda.

205
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:28,127
l am not an agenda.

206
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,766
You know what?

207
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:40,556
Go home.

208
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,727
l'm serious.

209
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,195
Take a break.

210
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,690
Well, it's what you want.

211
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:52,258
lsn't it?

212
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,367
l never said that.

213
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:59,427
Then l guess it's me.

214
00:16:17,535 --> 00:16:18,364
No.

215
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:23,767
Ted, tell Octonalhow much local support
we've got down here.

216
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,562
l don't know what to tell you.

217
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,396
We're in Houston looking for help.

218
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:29,661
Octonal has their own way of doing things.

219
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:32,734
l'm not the only one
who's going to fight for this.

220
00:16:32,802 --> 00:16:36,996
lf that's a threat, l'm not sure what that is.
But, you lose sight....

221
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:40,294
No. Ted, you're breaking up.

222
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:44,059
Don't lose track of where you stand
in the food chain around here.

223
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,795
l've got people here who've burned
their bridges to come work with us.

224
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:49,059
l can barely hear you.

225
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:50,291
Can you hear me?

226
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,498
Ted, whenever you're ready.

227
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:54,933
What the hell am l supposed to tell
my people?

228
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:59,059
Tell them Quad Carbon is finished.
Tell them Octonalis taking us over.

229
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,864
Tell them to get their resumes out.

230
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,565
l'm heading for the office.
l'll call you back on a landline.

231
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,862
Beatrice, thanks for coming in on Sunday.

232
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:45,392
Call Ted Fellner.
Tell him l'll be at the office in 20 minutes.

233
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:49,033
l've got to take the long way around.
Right.

234
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,698
l don't believe this. Fuck!

235
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,035
Shit!

236
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:18,359
My God!

237
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:42,197
No. lt's a telephone! lt's just a telephone.

238
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,627
No. l'm not doing anything!

239
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:52,562
No. l just need my briefcase.

240
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,099
l'm not part of this.

241
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,030
l have some really bad news.

242
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:17,560
You ought to go inside and sit down.
lt's about Peter.

243
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:29,166
This morning there was a roadblock
and these guys in ski masks....

244
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,828
They had guns and they took him
with a bunch of other people.

245
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,598
He's been kidnapped.
Do you understand what l'm saying?

246
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,702
We got a call from Tecala this morning.

247
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,603
You're not sending me there.

248
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,036
-l think if you hear me out....
-l just got off the plane, okay?

249
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:05,172
Terry, l need you down there.

250
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:07,802
l'm just not good at the moment.

251
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,238
l want you to consider this
your first management assignment.

252
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,339
The first of many.

253
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:18,002
We all get rattled. lt's not the first time.

254
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,463
That was kind of my point.

255
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,499
-Sir.
-Hey, Henry.

256
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,106
l'm on my way to the airport.

257
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:37,933
l'll call your mom, see if her and Michael
can make it up this weekend.

258
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:39,269
l'll call her.

259
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,871
What time is kickoff on Sunday? 2:00?

260
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,563
Yes, sir.

261
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,367
l was really looking forward to it.

262
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:58,164
Better get back out there with your mates.

263
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,805
Yes, sir.

264
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,034
Can l speak now? Because this is wrong.

265
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:44,800
This is so wrong.

266
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,532
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

267
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:50,238
l'm here to build a dam.

268
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:56,068
No. l don't work on the pipeline.

269
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:01,575
l'm here to build the dam at Chimaya.

270
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:05,736
-For the pipeline.
-Not for the pipeline.

271
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,571
-Yes, for the pipeline.
-Listen to me--

272
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,705
Listen to me. Just listen.

273
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:14,705
To stop the flooding.
Can you understand that?

274
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:19,103
Don't you hear me? Didn't you hear me?

275
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:22,836
l don't work for the pipeline!
l'm here to help the people of Tecala.

276
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,473
You are a prisoner.

277
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:37,101
Una foto, por favor.

278
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,441
That's it.

279
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,834
This whole box is just....

280
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:03,472
We brought some albums with us.
l was gonna...

281
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,877
...organize all this,
and l just never got it together.

282
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:11,638
Oh God, what's that? lt's lndia?

283
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:15,644
Alice, stop now.
We need just one good picture of his face.

284
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:20,778
Sorry.

285
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:25,201
l'm the one who's sorry.
l don't understand my country anymore.

286
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,474
No, it was completely random.

287
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,870
He was out in the barrio.

288
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:43,335
Anything can happen out there.
They steal your car, your money, whatever.

289
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,943
No, we don't really know a damn thing.

290
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:47,806
Nothing definite at all.

291
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,038
Let me call you back.

292
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,344
You're telling him
we don't know what happened?

293
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,436
At this point, we don't know.

294
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:00,740
He was kidnapped, Jerry.

295
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,046
He was taken at gunpoint in a roadblock.

296
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,641
Twenty-five people saw him drive away
in that goddamn truck.

297
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:11,941
l don't know, maybe it's me,
but that sounds pretty fucking definitive.

298
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,244
Alex, it's your sister-in-law again.

299
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,874
Janis, did you get the flight?

300
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,669
Welcome back, Mr. Thorne.
How long will you stay this time?

301
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,403
Mr. Peter Bowman.

302
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,436
Let's have a look at you, mate.

303
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:10,578
Janis!

304
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:12,611
Alice!

305
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:17,308
-Go here. Sandro will get your bag.
-Okay.

306
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:23,637
-Tickets, ma'am.
-Okay. Yeah.

307
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,639
Please don't lose my luggage.

308
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:52,872
There's a guy waiting from England.
He wants to talk to you about Peter.

309
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:54,810
He says it's important.

310
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:00,012
l was against this, but they insist.

311
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:02,378
Sorry. l hope we did the right thing.

312
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:05,539
-What's Luthan Risk lnternational?
-He's a negotiator.

313
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:08,575
-Shall l go with you?
-No. l'll take care of it.

314
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:09,478
Hi.

315
00:26:10,516 --> 00:26:13,347
How are you? l'm Peter's sister.
Can we help you?

316
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,316
Terrence Thorne. How do you do?

317
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,178
Considering the circumstances,
we're doing all right.

318
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,806
How do you do, Mrs. Bowman?

319
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:23,543
l'm with Luthan Risk.
We're an international consultancy--

320
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,242
l have one. Your card.

321
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:30,410
We're based in London. l'm with
our Security and Crisis Response Unit.

322
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,105
l'm sorry for appearing like this.

323
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:35,343
My company is the designated
K and R consultant for Quad Carbon.

324
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:37,212
''K and R.'' What is K and R?

325
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,314
Kidnap and Ransom.

326
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:43,041
-You just flew in?
-Correct. Last night.

327
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:45,307
Have you spoken to anyone
at Quad Carbon?

328
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:49,611
London may have. l was just assigned.
All l've seen is an employment dossier.

329
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,339
l'd like to get a proper file going.
l've some questions, and so must you.

330
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,077
l'll try and explain as much as l can.

331
00:27:01,784 --> 00:27:03,080
This is a game.

332
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:06,641
lt's a game youplay,
whether you like it or not.

333
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,107
For you, it's emotional. For thepeople
holding Peter, it's a business.

334
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:14,383
The sooner you get comfortable
and objective about that...

335
00:27:14,451 --> 00:27:16,246
...the easier this willbe.

336
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:21,582
People take hostages all over the world.
Sometimes, it's purely terror...

337
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:24,181
...other times it's political,
propaganda purposes.

338
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,717
Down here, it's simply about money.

339
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:29,012
So...

340
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,444
...where is Peter? Where is he now?

341
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:35,515
Probably in the mountains.
He's probably been taken by the ELT.

342
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:36,977
Look...

343
00:27:37,985 --> 00:27:39,575
...l just got off a plane.

344
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:42,549
Can we back up a little bit here, please?

345
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,984
This ELT...

346
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,310
...this group, who the hell are they?

347
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:51,643
And how can you be so sure
they're the ones who have my brother?

348
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:58,743
This is a land reform movement.
These people are revolutionaries.

349
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,546
lnitially, there was a political agenda.

350
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:04,379
However, what you must understand is...

351
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:06,213
...today's version ofthe EL T...

352
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,911
...is a completely different animal.
Twenty years ago...

353
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:12,748
...they were a struggling Marxist
revolutionary group in the mountains.

354
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,842
The end ofthe Cold War
changed everything.

355
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,475
The money from Moscow dried up...

356
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,314
...and the ELThad to finda new way
to support itself.

357
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:22,352
So they got into kidnapping,
which has made them millions.

358
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,011
Then they realized they were sitting on
an even bigger goldmine.

359
00:28:26,086 --> 00:28:29,916
Behind Colombia, Tecala is the world's
largest supplier ofcocaine.

360
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:34,380
The ELThad the weapons andan unlimited
supply ofpoor, illiterate soldiers.

361
00:28:34,886 --> 00:28:38,943
They came in hardand they came in fast,
and they took over the drug trade.

362
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,347
Whatever political agenda
they started with...

363
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,943
...has been completely perverted.

364
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:46,776
Did you know that when you moved here?

365
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:52,145
Listen. Can we get practical here,
just for a second?

366
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:54,777
Can you just explain how this works,
step by step?

367
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,677
We wait for contact,
they make a demand, we start negotiating.

368
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,981
Negotiate? What's to negotiate?

369
00:29:01,054 --> 00:29:03,952
Everything. We pay too fast,
pay too much...

370
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,084
...make it look too easy,
and instead of getting Peter back...

371
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:10,779
...we'llget a message thanking us
for the down payment andasking for more.

372
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:13,411
All that we want to do is finda number.

373
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,982
A dollar figure that gets Peter back
in onepiece as quickly as possible.

374
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,612
No.

375
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:35,477
Let me clarify something.
This is not about rescues.

376
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,713
This is not about bringing anyone
tojustice.

377
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:39,777
Relying on the police down here
is dangerous.

378
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:42,649
The army is no better.
They're pumped up and trigger-happy.

379
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:46,210
The last thing we need is heroics,
so we rely on nobody, nobody local.

380
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:49,152
And the embassy?
l'm still waiting for them to call me back.

381
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,187
The US mission down here
at the moment...

382
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:55,051
...is to try andbreak the ELTand switch
the country's economy from drugs...

383
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:56,485
...topetroleum.

384
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:58,748
Peter does not fit into thoseplans.

385
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:01,481
The embassy cannot help you
and they know it.

386
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:05,443
The most you'llget is a sympathetic smile
anda pat on the back.

387
00:30:05,522 --> 00:30:07,351
How long is this gonna take?

388
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,280
ln truth, l don't know.

389
00:30:09,388 --> 00:30:13,184
You need to settle in for a long haul.
Nothing goes quickly in Tecala.

390
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,278
But thepeople holding Peter,
they do know what they're doing.

391
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:19,879
He's a very valuable commodity,
andit's in their best interest...

392
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,717
...to keep him healthy.

393
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:27,711
Was Peter in the habit of taking off
and not telling you where he would be?

394
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:31,114
No. What are you getting at?

395
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,954
How is his health?

396
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,448
Peter's health has always been fine.

397
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:36,886
-Medication?
-No.

398
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:41,854
-What about allergies?
-No. Nothing.

399
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:44,081
He's allergic to chlorine and strawberries.

400
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:47,179
A blood vessel popped in his eye.
He's been taking drops.

401
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:49,620
And he's very prone to ear infections.

402
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,644
What about emotionally? ls he equipped
to handle this kind of stress?

403
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,980
What kind of stress?

404
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:35,281
l don't know, Frank. He doesn't know.
lt could be one week, it could be six.

405
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:38,452
She's Alice. What can l tell you?
Alice is Alice.

406
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,820
She's still out there,
trying to save the world.

407
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:44,289
-l can't tell you what she's feeling.
-Who are you? l mean...

408
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,754
...people who do this,
are you lawyers, foreign service, what?

409
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:51,521
Some law enforcement, some intelligence.
Mostly, it's military.

410
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:54,614
-Which are you?
-l was a soldier.

411
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,013
What kind of soldier?

412
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,018
British army.

413
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:02,256
-You sound Australian.
-l am.

414
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,454
l was in the regiment at home...

415
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:08,150
...but we don't get into a lot of action
down there, so l went to England.

416
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:10,452
SAS. Special Air Service.

417
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,090
''Special,'' meaning what? Special Forces?

418
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:14,949
Right.

419
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,852
She is a trip.

420
00:32:23,825 --> 00:32:26,757
-Do they get on?
-With Peter? She drives him crazy.

421
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:31,084
Sometimes l think we've been bouncing
around the world so he can avoid her.

422
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,455
l read that in the employment dossier.

423
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:36,980
The ''bouncing around.''

424
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,881
He shouldn't have been in that convertible.

425
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,255
His stupid goddamn car.

426
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:48,620
Tell me, what's with all the scorpions?

427
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:54,618
This house. lt's insane, isn't it?

428
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:59,725
Some busted drug lord, El Escorpión,
built it for one of his mistresses.

429
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:03,890
Peter called and said he had found
this ridiculous, enormous house...

430
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,051
...that nobody wanted
because it was supposed to be cursed.

431
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:12,782
One of the maids comes every Monday
and sprinkles holy water around.

432
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:16,155
So maybe it is cursed, all that bad juju.

433
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,417
So, this is your life. This is what you do.

434
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,351
Go into people's houses,
tell them how it is.

435
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:31,918
That's part of it.

436
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:35,255
Try to figure out what they're like,
how they'll be and hold up.

437
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,486
That's what you're doing, isn't it?

438
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,325
Mrs. Bowman, l'm on your side.

439
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:44,185
So, how am l doing...

440
00:33:44,594 --> 00:33:46,617
...you know, for the bereaved spouse?

441
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:49,549
Your husband isn't dead. He's alive.

442
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,693
And l will do everything l can
to make sure he gets home safe.

443
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,420
This won't work if you bullshit me.

444
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:58,357
l can see that.

445
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,289
So we'll be straight up, then?

446
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:02,760
That's exactly how we'll do it.

447
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,559
Sorry.

448
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:11,488
God, you'd think l'd been gone for a month.

449
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:12,491
Would you like some wine?

450
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,057
You know l don't drink.

451
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,158
So, where were we?

452
00:34:42,095 --> 00:34:43,958
l like this!

453
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,483
He's loco.

454
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:02,354
Don't be afraid, we're not gonna kill you.

455
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:28,953
The competition arrives.

456
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:40,660
Hello, mate.

457
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:43,759
l heard an ugly rumor
you were around somewhere.

458
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,887
l thought you'd gone all civilized
and unsocial on us.

459
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,059
What's this? A face-lift?

460
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,057
Yeah, l'm doing one side at a time.
You good?

461
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,587
He looks like shit, but he's working.

462
00:35:54,663 --> 00:35:56,095
What are you celebrating?

463
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:59,153
Life, liberty, and the ability
to purchase clitoris.

464
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:00,397
Jesus!

465
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,529
Thank God you're here, Terry.

466
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,454
Because the quality of conversation
has been just ''bloody appalling.''

467
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:10,824
Where was it?

468
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:13,263
Someone said you were in Turkey?

469
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,456
Not Turkey, Chechnya.

470
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,196
-With the Frenchman, Lenoir.
-Keeping updated?

471
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:23,557
My guys turned that one down.
lt's a job Wyatt's outfit would take.

472
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:26,152
Thought you were retiring.

473
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:31,356
Yes, l was,
but lnherent Risk rang me with a sob story.

474
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:35,158
Could l, please? ''Old time's sake?''

475
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:37,596
What are you doing?

476
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,862
l'm working on the biggest thing
down here.

477
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:43,459
He's doing the ltalian.

478
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:45,824
Calitri. Banker.

479
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,329
-Very pleased with himself.
-l can tell.

480
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:53,861
And lan has you off
in fucking Chechnya alone.

481
00:36:54,198 --> 00:36:58,255
That's why l left. Luthan Risk doesn't give
a shit about you, and you know it.

482
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:00,862
Your cops still on the payroll?

483
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:04,091
-Better than ever. Judges, too.
-Will you run some names for me?

484
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:06,427
That top one is this client's driver.

485
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:11,063
-Shouldn't be a problem, for a hefty price.
-Will we ever get a drink?

486
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,223
l think somebody's kidnapped the barman.

487
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,924
That's all right, mate.

488
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,224
My shout.

489
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,860
Bloody hell! That's just like mine.

490
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,126
lt is yours.

491
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:23,962
lt is mine.

492
00:37:26,665 --> 00:37:28,688
Hey, old mate. lt's good to see you.

493
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:35,830
Alice, l can't tell you how shocked l am
something like this could happen.

494
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:37,888
Did you get my wire? How are you doing?

495
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,831
-Janis Goodman. Peter's sister.
-Ted Fellner. Peter's boss.

496
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,491
-Nice to meet you.
-Let's step into my office.

497
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,664
l was in Houston, got this phone call.
l couldn't believe it.

498
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,528
l flew back here last night.
We've got everybody working...

499
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,259
...trying to access the information we need
to make some informed decisions.

500
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,561
Make them quick. The right decisions.
Please sit down.

501
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:59,394
Would you like some coffee or tea?

502
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,828
No, l think we're fine.

503
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,932
Where's Mr. Thorne?

504
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,827
The guy from Luthan Risk.

505
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,127
Right.

506
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,189
There's been a change in plans.

507
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,223
What kind of change?

508
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:23,026
We think it's best for all of us,
under the circumstances...

509
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,157
...to go with a local representative.

510
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:28,996
-You don't want to use Luthan Risk?
-What circumstances?

511
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,090
There's no insurance.

512
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:39,329
None of us, no one at Quad Carbon,
has been insured for kidnapping since July.

513
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:44,133
Some idiot was trying to cut costs
and didn't realize what they were doing.

514
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,198
Alice, honey, please.

515
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,127
This could be any one of us.

516
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:55,126
We're doing our best. We're talking
to Octonal, trying to get their input.

517
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:58,361
We're hoping they'll step up and cover this,
but at this point--

518
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,162
Don't they have to?

519
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:03,667
Their position is, they're buying a pipeline,
not the company.

520
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:06,398
-lt's a bit complicated.
-Their ''position''?

521
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,893
How do they already have a position?
This just happened!

522
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:13,864
Could you just tell me
where Quad Carbon stands in all of this?

523
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,097
Quad Carbon is evaporating.

524
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:21,362
They're selling off what they can.
Just a little late for miracles.

525
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:26,767
So you're all out of work?

526
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,328
lt would seem so.

527
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:35,963
Who's this?

528
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:38,533
This is Arturo Fernandez.

529
00:39:38,736 --> 00:39:39,826
Señora Bowman.

530
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:43,494
Mr. Fernandez has been
our local security coordinator for years.

531
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:45,966
He's very well connected
and very experienced.

532
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,729
lf you give us a few minutes you'll realize...

533
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,701
...just how lucky we are
to have him working with us.

534
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,362
Mr. Thorne, you're leaving so soon.

535
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:17,097
Perhaps next time we can go dancing.

536
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,159
Boy, did you have me fooled.

537
00:40:21,236 --> 00:40:24,031
-l was just about to call you.
-Where, from the plane?

538
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:29,265
You stood in my house and you told me
that l didn't have to worry anymore.

539
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:32,228
We thought Quad Carbon was still a client.

540
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:34,360
What about us? We can't be the client?

541
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:37,267
l really am sorry.
lt's not a good situation for us either.

542
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:38,462
''Us''?

543
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:40,062
You.

544
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:44,861
You stood in my kitchen and you told me
my husband was coming home.

545
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,498
Quad Carbon is out of business, okay?

546
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,931
Octonal spends $40 million a year
on K and R insurance in the world.

547
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:54,368
My company has 30 percent
of that package.

548
00:40:54,904 --> 00:40:58,166
-Octonal does not like conflict.
-Peter doesn't work for Octonal.

549
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:02,260
That's the point and the way they want it.
No Quad Carbon confusion.

550
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:06,070
l'm not even supposed to talk to you.

551
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:09,331
-So, this is you being brave?
-No, this is me doing my job.

552
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:13,370
lt's good l came by then, right?
Let you get that off your chest.

553
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,164
l'm sure it'll all work out.

554
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:17,893
You know they're giving us
some local security guy?

555
00:41:17,972 --> 00:41:20,335
Exactly the kind of guy
you warned me about.

556
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,064
What can l say? l don't make policy.

557
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:25,229
Great. So when this is over
and my husband is dead...

558
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:28,134
...and l'm suing these bastards,
you can tell the judge...

559
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:31,069
...you did everything you could
to help me out?

560
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,927
Wait a minute. Wait!

561
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:40,604
Listen to me, l'm sorry.
l apologize. l'm sorry!

562
00:41:41,606 --> 00:41:43,435
l'm sorry to be like this...

563
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:44,731
...but...

564
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,503
...you are...

565
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:49,900
...the first, you are the only person...

566
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:53,300
...l've met who knows
what they're talking about.

567
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:57,561
So, l'm begging you, l am totally
begging you to help me out on this.

568
00:41:57,772 --> 00:41:59,863
You asked me not to bullshit you, right?

569
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:01,238
Right.

570
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:03,297
l got a plane to catch.

571
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:19,106
Alice, l'm sorry.
We just had a call about Peter.

572
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,440
They said to look in our car
for a cell phone. This was there.

573
00:43:22,507 --> 00:43:24,905
They are calling back to this phone
in 20 minutes.

574
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:26,134
God, Alice...

575
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:28,003
...they have our phone number.

576
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:29,300
My God.

577
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:47,702
Peter is alive.

578
00:43:47,774 --> 00:43:51,070
He's definitely being held
by El Ejército de Liberación de Tecala.

579
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:54,471
He's in good health,
but he's a prisoner of war.

580
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:57,439
-They want $5 million for his release.
-Oh, my God.

581
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,769
Obviously, this is negotiable.

582
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:03,271
They always start with a big number.

583
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:08,068
He says that in order to make it better
for Peter's care and food...

584
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:12,336
...and to prove to us that he's alive,
they want to get a first transfer...

585
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:17,006
...as a gesture of good faith.
As soon as possible.

586
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:19,370
First transfer being what?

587
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:21,702
1 .5 billion pesos.

588
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:24,537
-Jesus!
-lt's only $50,000.

589
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,973
Can l talk to him?

590
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:29,733
No, l don't think so.

591
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,774
This guy is going to make one last contact.

592
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:35,632
He will let us know where to go for this.

593
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:41,941
But, ladies...

594
00:44:42,076 --> 00:44:45,531
...the important thing is that Peter is alive.

595
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:47,971
This is very positive.

596
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:49,639
lt's very fast.

597
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:52,408
A case like this? Very fast.

598
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:55,199
-Honest.
-Could you excuse us for a minute, please?

599
00:44:55,277 --> 00:44:56,140
Sure.

600
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:57,267
Thank you.

601
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,967
l am not trusting that man with $50,000.

602
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,599
-What is the alternative?
-You feel good about this? About him?

603
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:13,473
This whole thing feels thrown together.
lt feels out of control.

604
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,407
There's more than one person
who does this.

605
00:45:15,477 --> 00:45:17,670
You've been calling for two days
and nothing!

606
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:19,972
l want to wait for the guy in Miami.

607
00:45:20,143 --> 00:45:24,337
How long, five days, two weeks? You want
to comparison-shop? Peter is alive now!

608
00:45:24,444 --> 00:45:27,104
Peter is my little brother.

609
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:32,505
l'm trying to be smart about this.

610
00:45:32,744 --> 00:45:35,267
l've never done this before.

611
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,136
l know. l'm just....

612
00:45:37,378 --> 00:45:38,638
l know.

613
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,907
l know.

614
00:45:48,744 --> 00:45:50,267
Ask him where he thinks l'll go?

615
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:02,076
Ask him how long l have to be here.

616
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:21,675
What did he say?

617
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,078
Never mind. lt's okay.

618
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:37,009
Lord Lucan is actually living in the Ukraine.

619
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:39,975
ln a sanatorium.

620
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,102
Terry.

621
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:44,577
-Welcome back.
-Hello, Terry.

622
00:46:47,512 --> 00:46:49,239
Pleasure seeing you again.

623
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:54,804
Round at Westminster
and back down to Greenwich, please.

624
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,768
l'll have two of these, please.

625
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,446
Here's to dodging bullets.

626
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:15,309
We almost lost a $12 million contract
over this Quad Carbon fiasco.

627
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,175
Octonal got quite put off
by the whole adventure.

628
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:20,211
l'm sure you did, as well.

629
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:22,602
Quite right, too.

630
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,209
l'll make it up to you, Terry, l will.

631
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:29,946
So, what happens to these people?

632
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,002
Who?

633
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:33,637
The Bowmans.
What happens to them now?

634
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:36,305
Come on. They'll find a way through.

635
00:47:36,513 --> 00:47:41,242
We've got half a dozen firms on our backs.
Believe me, somebody wants this case.

636
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:42,811
Okay. Who?

637
00:47:43,114 --> 00:47:46,876
Name a company that doesn't have
Octonal business that you'd trust.

638
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:49,343
Trust with your own family.

639
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:51,002
They'll be fine!

640
00:47:56,947 --> 00:47:58,277
Look...

641
00:47:59,281 --> 00:48:02,145
...l got a trip to Bangkok.
Two or three days at the most.

642
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:05,647
Strictly management assignment.
Wave the flag. Talk to a few people.

643
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:09,374
After that, l thought you might want
a trip to the beach at Phuket.

644
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,179
lf you're handling the twenties, it's fifty.

645
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:34,204
-And if you're handling fifties--
-l know.

646
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,909
Don't!

647
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,181
Damn it!

648
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:53,574
-Shit! This is ridiculous!
-Janis.

649
00:49:58,351 --> 00:50:01,249
-Hold on. How many did you have?
-l had 50.

650
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:04,008
Why does everyone keep asking
how much money l have?

651
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,516
Please, Mr. Fernandez.

652
00:50:05,584 --> 00:50:07,379
Come on, Janis. Calm down.

653
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:12,083
Are you expecting someone?

654
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,138
No.

655
00:50:16,217 --> 00:50:17,513
Watch out!

656
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:19,579
This guy is so....

657
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,343
Maybe it's Elio.

658
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:28,375
-Whoever it is, out!
-Please, let me handle it.

659
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:43,445
What are you doing here?

660
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:45,809
l wanted to apologize.

661
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:49,041
l thought you did that already.

662
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:52,109
My God, it's you!

663
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,885
-Hello, Janis.
-What do you want?

664
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:57,941
l wanted to tell you l'm sorry
about the way things went.

665
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,951
Great, it's just that...

666
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,981
...we're in the middle of something.

667
00:51:02,052 --> 00:51:05,177
l understand your reluctance,
but l want to offer you my services.

668
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:06,945
Haven't we done this already?

669
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:09,883
-l thought your hands were tied.
-They were.

670
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,379
What about your company?

671
00:51:14,785 --> 00:51:16,479
l'd be doing this alone.

672
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:22,813
Señora, please!

673
00:51:31,686 --> 00:51:34,743
-What's all this?
-We're putting together a payment.

674
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,713
-What kind of payment?
-For Peter. A good faith payment.

675
00:51:38,786 --> 00:51:41,513
-Good faith?
-We're getting a proof of life.

676
00:51:41,753 --> 00:51:43,742
Who put this together?

677
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,513
How are you doing? l'm Terry Thorne.

678
00:51:51,354 --> 00:51:52,580
What do you have here?

679
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:56,450
We got one, two, three guys with guns.
A shitload of money.

680
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,781
Holy snapping assholes, look at this!

681
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,611
Tell them to put those guns down!

682
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,284
All right!

683
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,512
l asked you not to come in.
Maybe these ladies don't understand.

684
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:16,052
But you understand!

685
00:52:16,387 --> 00:52:19,751
-l get this.
-You want to talk, come back later!

686
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:23,682
-Like when the money is gone?
-There you go.

687
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:27,883
Okay. All right.

688
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,945
That's what l'm doing.

689
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:33,350
l do this for a living. l do this all the time.

690
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,180
This is my job, you know?

691
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:37,685
You never buy a proof of life.

692
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,414
Bullshit! You don't know
what you're talking about.

693
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:44,977
You never pack money in your client's
house unless it's a fucking emergency.

694
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:48,350
And you don't wave guns around people
you're trying to help.

695
00:52:49,021 --> 00:52:50,510
Don't do that!

696
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:54,446
Put your gun down
or l'll blow your head off.

697
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:55,578
Now!

698
00:52:58,054 --> 00:52:59,042
Just calm down.

699
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:00,109
Do it!

700
00:53:01,855 --> 00:53:03,184
There you go.

701
00:53:03,488 --> 00:53:05,647
What are you gonna do now, asshole?

702
00:53:06,622 --> 00:53:07,588
Alice.

703
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:10,020
Ask him to leave.

704
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,314
What?

705
00:53:12,488 --> 00:53:15,852
Thank them very much for their help
and ask them to leave.

706
00:53:16,122 --> 00:53:18,553
Me? You are telling me?

707
00:53:19,255 --> 00:53:20,777
You're taking the case?

708
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:23,549
-Yes.
-Enough with this. Leave, now.

709
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,615
Mr. Fernandez...

710
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:32,613
...l'd like you to go.

711
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:37,121
-You heard Mrs. Bowman.
-l'm not going anywhere, pal.

712
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:39,178
You are. Now!

713
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,016
Can l make a suggestion?

714
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:45,917
Can hardly wait, can l?

715
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:51,515
l think you should calm down,
then look over there and meet my friend.

716
00:53:55,522 --> 00:53:56,988
Arturo.

717
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,518
-Down. Put the fucking thing down.
-l thought you'd gone legit.

718
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,520
Dino.

719
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:04,820
Yeah.

720
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,217
Let's go.

721
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,778
All right, you too. Right now!

722
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,019
Okay.

723
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:17,188
Let's get this all cleaned up.

724
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,389
When are you guys
gonna put those things away?

725
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:49,287
Have a cigarette, it might help.

726
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:54,390
Sandro's going around again.
Eliodoro is ready now.

727
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,287
We are the talk of the town.

728
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:58,654
-ls it complimentary?
-You'd be flattered.

729
00:54:58,725 --> 00:55:01,122
-Where's Mrs. Bowman?
-Check the kitchen.

730
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,515
-Hey.
-Yeah?

731
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,985
That was fun?

732
00:55:05,091 --> 00:55:06,148
Yeah.

733
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:13,423
Mrs. Bowman?

734
00:55:26,992 --> 00:55:28,083
Alice?

735
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,084
Dino and Sandro
are taking the dummy bags into town.

736
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:41,647
Make it look good.

737
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:43,986
We'll keep the cash here.

738
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:49,214
l need to know, was there any kind
of plan? Was there a contact schedule?

739
00:55:50,692 --> 00:55:51,715
No.

740
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,354
We're just waiting for another call.

741
00:55:57,259 --> 00:56:00,191
l haven't cried since this started.
lt's just....

742
00:56:00,592 --> 00:56:02,115
Hey, it's okay.

743
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:04,715
lt's just the tension. Finally, it just....

744
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:06,350
lt's okay.

745
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,385
Why are you doing this?

746
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,190
Nobody was going to take your case.

747
00:56:30,094 --> 00:56:31,787
Nobody any good, anyway.

748
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:34,157
l know.

749
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,520
But you came back.

750
00:56:41,027 --> 00:56:43,016
We have to do this my way, right?

751
00:56:43,094 --> 00:56:45,559
We'll do it together,
but you've just got to....

752
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:46,517
Even if it gets tough.

753
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,192
You have to learn to trust me.

754
00:57:18,028 --> 00:57:19,721
-'Morning.
-How are you?

755
00:57:21,594 --> 00:57:23,958
We've been listening to this all night.

756
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,458
Estúpido is right.

757
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:27,917
So, what are you doing here?

758
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:31,722
-Linda, you're smart, a good person.
-l have no family.

759
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:33,619
This is not your family.

760
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:35,092
They are my family.

761
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:37,127
-Let me be your family.
-No.

762
00:57:38,729 --> 00:57:41,354
-They are my family.
-They're not your family.

763
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:43,124
Linda.

764
00:57:43,261 --> 00:57:44,693
Please.

765
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,394
Just help me.

766
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:50,684
You can do it.

767
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,488
Help me.

768
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:30,221
-Who answered the phone?
-Maria.

769
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:31,995
l was in the shower.

770
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:35,324
-Janis stayed in case there are more calls.
-Where did they hide it?

771
00:58:35,396 --> 00:58:38,692
Look for the Jesus with the purple robe.
Under the altar cloth.

772
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,126
-Did you get it?
-lt's good.

773
00:59:21,297 --> 00:59:25,321
We got radio frequencies, times to call.
We're on for Wednesdays and Sundays.

774
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:55,261
l'd like five minutes alone with you,
without your gun.

775
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:59,231
l'd take your whole fucking world apart
without breaking a sweat. Comprende?

776
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,524
l want my shirt, l want my spoon.

777
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:16,192
Aim that fucking thing at me
one more time....

778
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:18,828
Show me how fucking big you are!

779
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,257
l'll make you eat that goddamn rifle!

780
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,791
-He wants the family.
-Tell him to forget it.

781
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:46,391
We represent the family. Just do it.

782
01:02:46,636 --> 01:02:47,624
Do it.

783
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:57,791
Put his wife on the radio right now,
or we forget the whole fucking thing!

784
01:02:59,336 --> 01:03:00,562
Who is this?

785
01:03:00,836 --> 01:03:05,531
l saidl want to speak with the wife.
Who is this?

786
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:08,200
You can call me Tio. What's your name?

787
01:03:10,836 --> 01:03:12,166
Callme Marco.

788
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:16,030
You're not making all the rules here.

789
01:03:16,103 --> 01:03:17,729
We wanna work with you.

790
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:20,200
We want a proof of life
and we're not paying for it.

791
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:23,064
lf there's any good faith,
it can start with that.

792
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:24,898
Okay, Uncle Tio.

793
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,868
So you are the one in charge now?

794
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:27,561
That's right.

795
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,603
Good.

796
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,034
Then you willbe responsible
for the death ofPeter Bowman.

797
01:03:32,336 --> 01:03:33,768
Do you understandme?

798
01:03:33,837 --> 01:03:35,326
You are responsible!

799
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,492
-He's gone?
-Yeah.

800
01:03:38,903 --> 01:03:41,960
lt's all right, just get used to it.
lt's the way it's done.

801
01:04:11,537 --> 01:04:12,901
Goddamn it.

802
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:29,760
l've never seen you smoke.

803
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:31,668
l smoke when l play cards.

804
01:04:32,904 --> 01:04:35,029
ls that supposed to be reassuring?

805
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:37,728
This is how it goes.

806
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:38,971
Okay?

807
01:04:39,038 --> 01:04:41,596
They've come to us.
We've established radio contact.

808
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:43,331
This is all positive.

809
01:04:44,238 --> 01:04:45,727
Who do you care about?

810
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:48,999
l told you you'd have to trust me,
and you said you could.

811
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:53,801
Dino says you have a 13-year-old son.

812
01:04:55,772 --> 01:04:58,102
Yeah. Surprised?

813
01:04:58,505 --> 01:05:00,199
What if it was him?

814
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:03,030
What if it was your son
up there in the mountains?

815
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:07,232
l would find somebody that l could trust
and l would do what they told me.

816
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,800
So, what's your son like?

817
01:05:18,473 --> 01:05:19,700
He's quiet.

818
01:05:20,272 --> 01:05:21,931
Smart, you know.

819
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:25,135
Seems to make good friends.

820
01:05:25,873 --> 01:05:27,304
Good rugby player.

821
01:05:28,439 --> 01:05:30,268
You know, l see him all done up...

822
01:05:30,339 --> 01:05:33,794
...and l think, God, he's just at the end
of being a boy, and...

823
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,829
...l missed it.

824
01:05:37,273 --> 01:05:39,296
Just haven't been there for him.

825
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:43,032
You know, truthfully...

826
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,729
...we really don't know each other.

827
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:48,772
When he talks to me
it's like he's on a parade ground.

828
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,530
So he's a soldier like his dad.

829
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,671
No. He wants to be a pilot
and get all the girls.

830
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,436
And his mother?

831
01:06:00,073 --> 01:06:01,801
Now, there's the soldier.

832
01:06:02,273 --> 01:06:04,000
l guess she'd have to be.

833
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:08,430
Do you know how an English
general's daughter gets back at Daddy?

834
01:06:09,707 --> 01:06:11,400
She marries an Australian.

835
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:16,329
You never remarried?

836
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,104
l took up the veil, you know? This job.

837
01:06:20,174 --> 01:06:22,867
You gotta have rhythm,
you start moving, and...

838
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,798
...it just takes over.

839
01:06:53,575 --> 01:06:54,563
Name.

840
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:56,005
Peter Bowman.

841
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:03,733
Come.

842
01:07:14,942 --> 01:07:16,465
You stay here.

843
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:40,332
What?

844
01:07:41,876 --> 01:07:42,933
Quiet! Whisper!

845
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,032
You came today from the mountains?

846
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,929
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

847
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,356
Peter Bowman.

848
01:07:55,733 --> 01:07:58,495
You know my name? l'm a missionary.

849
01:07:59,433 --> 01:08:01,023
You know something...

850
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,362
...perhaps, about my situation?
Some news?

851
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,364
No, l don't know.

852
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:11,096
Are you a hostage, too?

853
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,799
There's an ltalian.

854
01:08:15,901 --> 01:08:19,095
Up the hill, at the farmhouse.
He came a week ago.

855
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:21,232
ls he your friend?

856
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:24,999
No, l was brought here alone.

857
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:28,292
What kind of camp is this?

858
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,394
Once it was only for drugs...

859
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,865
...to make cocaine at the river.

860
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:37,527
But now from the fighting...

861
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:40,724
...it's all for soldiers.

862
01:08:41,635 --> 01:08:43,430
How long have you been here?

863
01:08:48,434 --> 01:08:50,263
You need soap for your feet?

864
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,660
Maybe tomorrow, l can steal some.

865
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,630
How long have you been here?

866
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,866
Nineteen months.

867
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:04,694
They think l'm crazy.

868
01:09:20,168 --> 01:09:21,498
Dover.

869
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:24,027
-Terry, l'm sorry.
-This is Alice Bowman.

870
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:26,295
Janis Goodman, Dover McLoon,
consulate officer.

871
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:29,199
l know we scheduled to meet today,
but something's come up.

872
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:32,758
-We've been waiting for an hour and a half.
-l know that.

873
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,524
l really want to hear about your progress.

874
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:37,567
l'm sympathetic, we all are, but...

875
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:40,034
-...we've got a situation.
-What kind of situation?

876
01:09:40,103 --> 01:09:42,591
l really just think we have to reschedule.

877
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:44,633
He's sympathetic.

878
01:09:45,103 --> 01:09:47,001
What the hell does that mean?

879
01:09:48,736 --> 01:09:51,294
The ELT just let off three car bombs
around the city.

880
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:54,961
They've threatened the embassy.
lt's a mess. l gotta go issue a statement.

881
01:09:55,036 --> 01:09:57,229
-That's okay, you stay safe.
-Thanks.

882
01:10:00,769 --> 01:10:03,292
We need to clear out.
They've had a bomb threat.

883
01:10:17,303 --> 01:10:19,428
-What's happening?
-Get in the car!

884
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:22,970
What's this?

885
01:10:23,037 --> 01:10:25,162
-ls it from them?
-Don't open that.

886
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:27,794
-lt's from them, isn't it?
-Open it!

887
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,665
Put your seat belts on,
we're going to the hotel.

888
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,561
-Just open it.
-Not here.

889
01:10:35,437 --> 01:10:39,596
Okay, how about a nice big smile,
you skinny motherfucker.

890
01:10:44,737 --> 01:10:45,725
Shit!

891
01:10:48,337 --> 01:10:49,825
Close the door.

892
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,697
Take a seat.

893
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:54,300
Just open it. Please, just open it.

894
01:10:54,437 --> 01:10:56,596
Come on. ls it a proof of life or not?

895
01:10:56,671 --> 01:10:58,728
Give me a minute and take a seat.

896
01:11:12,538 --> 01:11:13,526
lt is.

897
01:11:14,338 --> 01:11:16,031
lt's a proof of life, isn't it?

898
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:19,162
Usually, l do this by myself, okay?
Just wait a minute.

899
01:11:19,638 --> 01:11:22,230
There's things here
that they want us to see.

900
01:11:29,938 --> 01:11:32,200
You never get a pretty picture, okay?

901
01:11:41,772 --> 01:11:43,237
His feet.

902
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,698
He looks terrible.

903
01:11:47,472 --> 01:11:49,529
What happened to his feet?

904
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,200
You said...

905
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:54,561
...that they knew he was valuable.

906
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:56,935
That they would take care of him.

907
01:11:58,872 --> 01:12:00,429
What are you doing?

908
01:12:04,172 --> 01:12:07,161
This is it, right?
The one he's holding in the picture?

909
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:10,637
-What, do you save all the papers?
-This is good news, okay?

910
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:12,638
l mean, this is good luck.

911
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,228
lt's what we've been waiting for.
We're in play.

912
01:12:15,306 --> 01:12:18,101
All we have to do now
is start talking specifics.

913
01:12:18,907 --> 01:12:19,930
Money.

914
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,404
l need to know exactly how much
l've got to work with.

915
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:26,997
You'll have to get back to Denver
and start putting this cash together.

916
01:12:27,073 --> 01:12:29,062
We're gonna shoot for $600,000.

917
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:31,330
l'm hoping that's where we land.

918
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:16,433
Thank you.

919
01:13:21,974 --> 01:13:23,837
Don't be a fool! Stop it!

920
01:13:25,108 --> 01:13:26,233
Calm down!

921
01:13:26,674 --> 01:13:28,197
lt's nothing!

922
01:13:29,575 --> 01:13:30,938
You see up there...

923
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:32,637
...the farmhouse?

924
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,303
That's where they've got the ltalian.

925
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:39,370
On the other side, down the valley...

926
01:13:39,742 --> 01:13:41,708
...that is where they make cocaine.

927
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:48,770
When you get home,
you'll want to talk about this. lt's normal.

928
01:13:48,842 --> 01:13:51,001
l know. lt's not restaurant conversation.

929
01:13:51,075 --> 01:13:53,802
lt's not for my friends,
it's not even for my kids.

930
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,068
-Right.
-Right.

931
01:13:55,142 --> 01:13:58,199
Turn that scramble phone on,
test it out straight away.

932
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:01,242
lf it doesn't work,
l'll come up with something else.

933
01:14:01,975 --> 01:14:03,441
You're doing great.

934
01:14:12,509 --> 01:14:13,906
Thank you.

935
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:18,501
lt's not every soccer mom
who gets her own encrypted phone, right?

936
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:23,531
lt's a lot of money.

937
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:26,401
$600,000.

938
01:14:27,509 --> 01:14:29,134
He's not even sure.

939
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:30,434
l know.

940
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:36,137
l know you've got the kids,
tuition, your mortgage.

941
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:38,835
l know all of it is impossible to ask.

942
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:41,839
But you're our only chance.

943
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:44,900
What if it's more?

944
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:49,103
l don't know.

945
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:55,033
But l swear, if it takes every day,
for the rest of my life, l will pay you back.

946
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,201
l will.

947
01:14:57,377 --> 01:14:59,502
l'm sorry if l've been....

948
01:15:01,544 --> 01:15:05,442
lt's just that l'm trying to get through this,
trying to be...

949
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,303
...strong.

950
01:15:10,944 --> 01:15:12,569
He's lucky to have you.

951
01:15:30,511 --> 01:15:31,874
Don't worry.

952
01:16:16,612 --> 01:16:18,305
-What's that?
-The alarm.

953
01:16:19,912 --> 01:16:21,276
When they ring the bell...

954
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:24,539
-...the army is crossing the river on a raid.
-Where are they going?

955
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,771
To protect their cocaine factories.

956
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:28,378
lt's becoming a war.

957
01:16:54,846 --> 01:16:57,210
-What is it?
-Nothing.

958
01:17:05,113 --> 01:17:06,306
What was that?

959
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:09,813
ELT sending a message.
lt's got nothing to do with us. Let's go.

960
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,437
$3 million is theprice for Peter Bowman.

961
01:17:13,613 --> 01:17:15,408
That's a ridiculous figure.

962
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,535
This is not a businessman.
He's an engineer, here to construct a dam.

963
01:17:19,647 --> 01:17:22,272
You're gonna have to come down
from $3 million.

964
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,336
Like this is a game.
We are saying concrete things...

965
01:17:25,413 --> 01:17:29,039
...and you are having us
suck cock with this bullshit.

966
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:34,111
At $400,000...

967
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,702
...you're already over my limit.

968
01:17:36,813 --> 01:17:40,246
So, what you need to do
is take that offer back and see if....

969
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:44,006
-What the hell are they bringing back?
-lt's a French helicopter.

970
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,810
How would you know that?

971
01:17:51,581 --> 01:17:52,706
What the hell is that?

972
01:18:03,948 --> 01:18:08,108
l've got very goodnews for you.
l've got another $50,000 for you.

973
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:10,338
$50,000 changes nothing!

974
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:12,743
lmight as well walk across the camp...

975
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:16,474
...go into his cell, andblow his brains out.

976
01:18:16,614 --> 01:18:17,773
Alice.

977
01:18:18,714 --> 01:18:20,408
He's nowhere near Peter.

978
01:18:20,881 --> 01:18:22,245
How do you know?

979
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,880
That's a weather sheet from last Sunday.
When l was talking to him...

980
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:30,346
...it was raining and when it was
thundering, l heard it on the radio.

981
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:33,745
lt's not raining in the mountains,
and we know Peter's three days away.

982
01:18:33,815 --> 01:18:36,280
That means that this guy is in this city.

983
01:18:37,248 --> 01:18:39,146
Marco, if...

984
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:43,480
...you are near Peter Bowman,
go and get him and put him on the radio...

985
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:48,012
...so he can talk to his wife,
and we'll accept that as a proof of life.

986
01:18:48,615 --> 01:18:49,808
Over.

987
01:18:54,782 --> 01:18:56,373
Do you copy?

988
01:19:03,683 --> 01:19:06,876
You must understand that you're dealing
with a single family here.

989
01:19:07,116 --> 01:19:09,674
We know he works for
that oil company Octonal.

990
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:13,775
We know that Octonalis
the biggest oil company in the world.

991
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,042
Peter Bowman doesn't work for Octonal.

992
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:19,705
Peter Bowman was here, subcontracting....

993
01:19:19,816 --> 01:19:22,146
-lt's her. Alice.
-Beautiful.

994
01:19:24,283 --> 01:19:27,182
lasked for $3 million, l come down
to two. lt's an insult.

995
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,216
He's losing faith in the family,
and especially in the wife.

996
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:31,940
This is bullshit. You know him.

997
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,540
We can't be responsible
for what he may do to himself!

998
01:19:35,983 --> 01:19:39,472
l think wejustput a bullet in his head
and sell you the body.

999
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,778
l couldn't listen anymore.

1000
01:19:52,884 --> 01:19:54,179
lt's all right.

1001
01:19:58,484 --> 01:19:59,609
You okay?

1002
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:04,609
People say things happen for a reason.

1003
01:20:04,684 --> 01:20:07,309
You must get a lot of that, right?

1004
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:15,948
l had a miscarriage eight months ago.

1005
01:20:16,285 --> 01:20:17,614
ln Africa.

1006
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:20,649
lt wasn't anybody's fault.
lt wasn't Peter's fault.

1007
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:24,212
Not like l didn't try to blame him, or...

1008
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:28,513
...blame myself like l deserved it,
like there was a reason.

1009
01:20:28,585 --> 01:20:30,846
lf l could just figure it out.

1010
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:36,175
l thought if l wasn't the one keeping
control, everything would fall apart.

1011
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,114
And l thought that l could just...

1012
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:41,712
...make it all happen.

1013
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:46,317
The places we've been, like Thailand...

1014
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:48,783
...Africa.

1015
01:20:51,518 --> 01:20:53,541
There's so much pain, you know.

1016
01:20:53,752 --> 01:20:56,684
You can't possibly make
any sense out of it.

1017
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:01,750
You can't push it away, even if you're
paralyzed by it. What good are you? So...

1018
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:05,707
...you let it go.

1019
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,813
And now that you don't have control?

1020
01:21:11,386 --> 01:21:12,817
lt's like a faith.

1021
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:14,676
Once you let go...

1022
01:21:15,519 --> 01:21:17,644
...everything becomes clear.

1023
01:21:19,553 --> 01:21:23,508
All the stupid, stupid shit
that l worried about.

1024
01:21:24,586 --> 01:21:26,381
Everything that l put her through.

1025
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:30,114
lt's like, since the baby, l....

1026
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:35,915
lt's like everything l learned along the way
somehow didn't apply to me, too.

1027
01:21:37,452 --> 01:21:39,918
You think l would have gotten
the message.

1028
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,915
l gotta get through this.

1029
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,149
l gotta get home.

1030
01:21:45,453 --> 01:21:47,918
Things don't happen for a reason.

1031
01:21:49,886 --> 01:21:51,409
They just...

1032
01:21:52,687 --> 01:21:54,050
...happen.

1033
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:01,048
My daughter is buried in Africa.

1034
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,011
Who can explain that?

1035
01:22:09,854 --> 01:22:11,376
What was her name?

1036
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:14,780
Mali.

1037
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:17,944
Mali Jasmine Bowman.

1038
01:22:18,754 --> 01:22:20,549
lt's a beautiful name.

1039
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:24,611
Nobody ever asked me that.

1040
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,547
Okay, Marco.

1041
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:51,148
We've got $475,000.

1042
01:22:51,321 --> 01:22:53,117
That is not a goodnumber!

1043
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:54,983
Marco, you've got to think about it.

1044
01:22:55,055 --> 01:22:59,181
lt is a good number. lt's the right number.
lt's the only number.

1045
01:23:07,055 --> 01:23:09,748
There is no company, no insurance.

1046
01:23:10,222 --> 01:23:11,983
All you're dealing with is the family.

1047
01:23:12,055 --> 01:23:13,487
This babble is bullshit.

1048
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:16,711
They need to start thinking harder,
like around $2million...

1049
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:18,981
...or they'llnever see him again.

1050
01:23:20,988 --> 01:23:24,887
We should close at $500,000.
We should look at $500,000.

1051
01:23:25,155 --> 01:23:26,644
You can forget it.

1052
01:23:28,355 --> 01:23:30,049
The family has worked very hard.

1053
01:23:30,122 --> 01:23:33,577
This is the complete net worth
and assets of this man's family.

1054
01:23:33,756 --> 01:23:35,278
lt's not possible.

1055
01:23:35,389 --> 01:23:37,514
lam trying, you understand?

1056
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,118
lam working mypeople.

1057
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:41,882
lam trying to make this happen.

1058
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:46,615
But lneed something from you.
You give me nothing, nothing!

1059
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:53,277
Marco, we got $600,000.

1060
01:23:54,356 --> 01:23:56,787
$600,000 changes nothing.

1061
01:23:56,856 --> 01:24:00,448
The maintenance alone for this brother
is more than you are offering.

1062
01:24:00,523 --> 01:24:02,250
lf that changes nothing...

1063
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:08,751
...then you'll have to come up with
a number that does start to change things.

1064
01:24:11,123 --> 01:24:15,783
lfyou go to $650,000
l will take that back to mypeople.

1065
01:24:19,957 --> 01:24:22,082
You think you can get $650,000?

1066
01:24:25,424 --> 01:24:28,753
Right, Marco.
We're going to close it at $650,000.

1067
01:24:29,124 --> 01:24:34,648
Okay. l willgo to mypeople andl'll talk
to you again on Sunday night.

1068
01:25:15,258 --> 01:25:18,088
No. lt's all right. l'll be over here.

1069
01:25:26,425 --> 01:25:27,448
Peter.

1070
01:25:28,892 --> 01:25:31,255
-What are you doing?
-Be quiet!

1071
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:40,092
-Are you crazy?
-Watch for me!

1072
01:25:42,492 --> 01:25:45,617
-What are you doing? lt's too dangerous.
-Give me your Bible.

1073
01:25:45,859 --> 01:25:48,257
-What for?
-Give me your goddamn Bible!

1074
01:25:49,959 --> 01:25:51,186
Watch.

1075
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,624
lt's all right!

1076
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,023
Jesus, we're right there.
And there is the pipeline.

1077
01:25:59,293 --> 01:26:00,281
Hurry up.

1078
01:26:02,192 --> 01:26:03,953
l can't believe we're so close.

1079
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:05,549
They are coming back.

1080
01:26:07,726 --> 01:26:10,021
You're crazy. You're risking our lives.

1081
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:11,490
Okay, almost.

1082
01:26:11,693 --> 01:26:12,852
Goddamn fool!

1083
01:26:12,927 --> 01:26:14,916
l'm going to bring it back!

1084
01:26:15,326 --> 01:26:16,724
l'll take it back.

1085
01:26:16,793 --> 01:26:19,725
No, it's too dangerous. l'll do it.

1086
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:34,349
Look at me!

1087
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,451
These pigs are lucky to have you.

1088
01:27:07,961 --> 01:27:09,722
Muy lucky.

1089
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,285
That's for your main account.
The others are subsidiary accounts.

1090
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,589
-l'm signing all these?
-And initial each page.

1091
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:21,752
You have to keep
each account under $200,000.

1092
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:25,051
Anything over that,
they put a magnifying glass on it.

1093
01:27:26,161 --> 01:27:29,491
Once the accounts are available,
it takes less than an hour...

1094
01:27:29,562 --> 01:27:32,858
...for the funds to be transferred
from your bank in Denver.

1095
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:39,757
Dino, that third drawer down
at the bottom, there's candles.

1096
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:43,094
Maria, can you grab me
some candle holders?

1097
01:27:43,795 --> 01:27:45,056
Sorry about that.

1098
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:48,720
Don't apologize, one has to live
with these guerrillas, l suppose.

1099
01:27:48,795 --> 01:27:51,159
Torch it up. There. Careful.

1100
01:27:53,362 --> 01:27:55,225
We need to initial the passport numbers.

1101
01:27:55,296 --> 01:27:56,921
The host with the most.

1102
01:27:57,662 --> 01:27:59,821
Just like your last birthday party.

1103
01:28:01,296 --> 01:28:03,558
What happened at your last birthday party?

1104
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:05,561
Terry popped out of a cake...

1105
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:09,225
...scared the shit out of us.
lt's a K and R thing.

1106
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:16,785
You got to get me a pair of those boots.

1107
01:28:16,863 --> 01:28:19,328
l'll never make it out of here in these.

1108
01:28:20,362 --> 01:28:22,590
-You won't make it without me.
-No!

1109
01:28:23,996 --> 01:28:27,792
l'm not going to be responsible for you.
This is my decision. For me.

1110
01:28:28,829 --> 01:28:31,420
Once l start, l'm not gonna turn back.

1111
01:28:31,863 --> 01:28:33,488
You're not responsible.

1112
01:28:34,397 --> 01:28:35,294
Erich.

1113
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:37,588
l have to get back to my wife.

1114
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:40,462
l have to. lf l stay here, l'll die.

1115
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:42,027
l know it.

1116
01:28:42,196 --> 01:28:44,594
This is not your problem.

1117
01:28:46,763 --> 01:28:48,320
l'm coming with you.

1118
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:50,891
l can't stay here alone.

1119
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:52,623
Not now.

1120
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,919
l'd go crazy.

1121
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:58,296
Marco, it's Tio. Acknowledge?

1122
01:28:59,964 --> 01:29:03,589
Marco, it's Tio. Do you copy? Over.

1123
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,828
ls this thing usual? What is this?
A ploy? What is he doing?

1124
01:29:08,297 --> 01:29:12,992
He said he'd be on the radio on Sunday.
He's taking the figure back.

1125
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:15,493
-That's a deal.
-Where is he?

1126
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:18,320
Marco, if for some reason
you can hear me...

1127
01:29:18,597 --> 01:29:20,620
...but l can't hear you...

1128
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:23,996
...we have to work out some other way
of communicating.

1129
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:25,427
Marco, do you copy?

1130
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:31,497
Acknowledge. Marco, do you copy?

1131
01:29:31,565 --> 01:29:35,361
lt's Tio. Calling Marco, do you copy?

1132
01:29:36,698 --> 01:29:40,596
We're getting a little anxious to know
if this deal is 100 percent.

1133
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:43,388
Ask if Peter is all right, can you?

1134
01:29:43,765 --> 01:29:46,959
We need some kind of indication
that Peter Bowman is okay.

1135
01:29:50,464 --> 01:29:51,657
Which way?

1136
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:54,397
The river's got to be this way!

1137
01:29:57,665 --> 01:30:00,063
Get up! We gotta keep moving!

1138
01:30:21,098 --> 01:30:24,121
-Come on!
-No, you got to get out of here!

1139
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:28,131
Take this! Get the map out of here!
lt's your only chance.

1140
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:31,165
-Promise me you'll keep going.
-l promise.

1141
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:34,820
Shit!

1142
01:30:55,567 --> 01:30:56,964
Where's your pigs?

1143
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,759
Marco, this is Tio. Do you copy?

1144
01:32:06,768 --> 01:32:07,995
Good day.

1145
01:32:08,734 --> 01:32:10,564
You better get out of there.

1146
01:32:10,935 --> 01:32:13,799
-What's up?
-The German. Kessler.

1147
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:15,164
That missionary fella?

1148
01:32:15,235 --> 01:32:18,928
He's out. Some farmer dumped him
at one of my precincts last night.

1149
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:22,067
What's that got to do with me?

1150
01:32:22,468 --> 01:32:25,764
He says he was with Peter.
He says they made a run for it.

1151
01:32:26,368 --> 01:32:28,391
lt doesn't sound good, Terry.

1152
01:32:31,201 --> 01:32:34,395
For the meals, we could eat together.

1153
01:32:35,335 --> 01:32:37,131
But the food, it's nothing.

1154
01:32:37,535 --> 01:32:39,763
lt's just to keep you alive.

1155
01:32:39,969 --> 01:32:44,924
But Peter would transform this crap
into a feast. He would say:

1156
01:32:45,969 --> 01:32:49,402
''Tonight, let's see
what Alice has made for us.''

1157
01:32:51,269 --> 01:32:52,633
Alice...

1158
01:32:54,503 --> 01:32:56,492
...you were everything for him.

1159
01:32:58,236 --> 01:33:01,725
He talked about you
and your daughter, Mali...

1160
01:33:02,169 --> 01:33:03,964
...all the time.

1161
01:33:05,703 --> 01:33:08,328
He loved you both so very much.

1162
01:33:10,503 --> 01:33:11,969
You have to know--

1163
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:16,465
l'm so sorry.

1164
01:33:17,603 --> 01:33:20,865
He didn't see him killed.
He didn't see a body. He heard a shot.

1165
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,868
You gotta wake up.
You gotta get real on this.

1166
01:33:25,337 --> 01:33:28,791
You don't spend that much time
working on a deal and kill your hostage.

1167
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,893
When was the last time you had contact?
A week? Two weeks?

1168
01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:34,902
l've just had nothing but 22 days of static.

1169
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:38,403
Maybe there are no more deals to be had.
Maybe this is coming apart.

1170
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:40,197
Maybe he's alive.

1171
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,867
Maybe he is.

1172
01:33:41,937 --> 01:33:45,370
Maybe he is. But what we do know
is that my guy is still up there...

1173
01:33:45,437 --> 01:33:48,267
...and they don't know Kessler's out.
They think he's dead.

1174
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:52,667
Kessler knows every inch of that camp,
and he's willing to help me.

1175
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:54,530
-He's a missionary--
-He's not!

1176
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:57,127
He is from the French Foreign Legion.

1177
01:33:57,604 --> 01:34:00,934
So what? He found God.
He's got a map in there.

1178
01:34:01,337 --> 01:34:03,826
A map that l think is real.

1179
01:34:05,837 --> 01:34:07,598
Where are you going with this?

1180
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:08,830
Okay.

1181
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:12,160
This has to stay quiet.

1182
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:14,661
And she has to know that.

1183
01:34:20,471 --> 01:34:23,528
You're thinking of going in?
ls that what you're thinking?

1184
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:25,628
Fuck thinking. That's what l'm doing.

1185
01:34:25,705 --> 01:34:30,194
l'm in there on the telephone. That's all
l can do. Tell me what else l should do.

1186
01:34:32,572 --> 01:34:35,197
Talk to me before you do anything, okay?

1187
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:37,064
For you, l can do that.

1188
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:38,563
For you.

1189
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:41,968
lf you don't keep me up to speed,
l'm gonna take it personally.

1190
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:44,130
You've been doing that a lot lately.

1191
01:34:47,205 --> 01:34:48,795
l can't hear any more of this!

1192
01:34:48,872 --> 01:34:51,430
-Wait!
-An eyewitness saw him killed.

1193
01:34:51,506 --> 01:34:53,903
Until we know for sure,
this has got to stay in play.

1194
01:34:53,972 --> 01:34:56,961
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

1195
01:34:57,905 --> 01:34:59,303
He didn't see a body.

1196
01:34:59,372 --> 01:35:01,338
Peter is dead!

1197
01:35:01,939 --> 01:35:03,735
Let me grieve!

1198
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:06,734
-Why can't you do that?
-lnstinct.

1199
01:35:06,939 --> 01:35:09,167
Until l know, until l'm sure...

1200
01:35:09,339 --> 01:35:12,669
...until l've received a visual confirmation
of the body of Peter...

1201
01:35:12,739 --> 01:35:16,103
...l'm looking to retrieve my cargo
and complete my mission.

1202
01:36:05,373 --> 01:36:07,033
She's just a girl.

1203
01:36:11,574 --> 01:36:15,836
She's too young to be involved in this,
please. lt's very dangerous for her.

1204
01:38:25,544 --> 01:38:26,941
How are you doing?

1205
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,738
l thought we had a deal going.

1206
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:33,072
l haven't heard from you in two weeks.
l miss you.

1207
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:39,476
Why don't you call me ''Tio''?

1208
01:38:40,744 --> 01:38:42,471
And l'll call you ''Marco.''

1209
01:38:47,045 --> 01:38:48,772
You've got a good game going.

1210
01:38:49,444 --> 01:38:51,808
Your wife thinks you're out
with the card buddies...

1211
01:38:51,878 --> 01:38:54,003
...they think you're off with a mistress.

1212
01:38:54,078 --> 01:38:56,908
And there you are, on the radio,
every Wednesday night...

1213
01:38:56,978 --> 01:38:59,035
...bartering human life.

1214
01:39:08,512 --> 01:39:10,637
This is a tape of my friend Marco.

1215
01:39:11,911 --> 01:39:13,502
lt's not the only one.

1216
01:39:16,345 --> 01:39:18,140
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1217
01:39:21,445 --> 01:39:23,877
ls Peter Bowman alive?

1218
01:39:25,712 --> 01:39:27,405
He tried to escape.

1219
01:39:28,278 --> 01:39:29,801
He was hurt.

1220
01:39:31,779 --> 01:39:32,745
He's alive.

1221
01:39:43,346 --> 01:39:45,437
ls he with the ltalian, Calitri?

1222
01:39:47,613 --> 01:39:49,737
How did you find me?

1223
01:39:51,379 --> 01:39:54,072
Now, l have $600,000 waiting.

1224
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:56,372
l'll get another $50,000 off the books...

1225
01:39:57,146 --> 01:39:59,806
...between you and me, if we get this done.

1226
01:40:01,546 --> 01:40:03,102
Or l've got this tape.

1227
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:07,475
l'll lay it on your golfing buddies and
you don't make it out of the car park alive.

1228
01:40:07,546 --> 01:40:10,069
So, let's just get this deal done, shall we?

1229
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:12,377
lt's not the money.

1230
01:40:12,446 --> 01:40:14,276
That doesn't matter anymore.

1231
01:40:14,446 --> 01:40:16,412
lt's always the money, Fred.

1232
01:40:16,713 --> 01:40:18,611
You have $1 billion?

1233
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:21,272
Because that's the money
we are talking about.

1234
01:40:22,013 --> 01:40:25,877
You think Octonal will buy this pipeline
without a promise from the army...

1235
01:40:25,947 --> 01:40:28,106
...to completely destroy us?

1236
01:40:28,247 --> 01:40:31,407
That pipeline goes right through
our coca fields!

1237
01:40:32,614 --> 01:40:34,273
They are buying a war.

1238
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,139
Peter Bowman will never get down.

1239
01:40:37,781 --> 01:40:39,804
He knows too much.

1240
01:40:40,113 --> 01:40:42,079
We are fighting for our life.

1241
01:40:42,147 --> 01:40:45,602
Listen to me. There are no more deals.

1242
01:40:47,380 --> 01:40:49,175
Enjoy the parade, Fred.

1243
01:40:52,614 --> 01:40:55,944
This is the camp.
He said they call it Canyon Verde.

1244
01:40:56,181 --> 01:40:59,874
This is the river. This valley,
the big one below, is very active.

1245
01:40:59,948 --> 01:41:02,607
Every time the army moves through,
there's a skirmish.

1246
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,806
March, May and June.

1247
01:41:04,914 --> 01:41:09,472
Kessler said that every couple of weeks,
the whole camp would run out and fight.

1248
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:13,770
-Pipeline?
-Fifteen clicks down river.

1249
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:22,239
Terry Thorne. Tomas Morales.

1250
01:41:22,315 --> 01:41:25,611
These guys are top. They're
my Panama crew, l trained them myself.

1251
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:32,671
So, simply, all we have to do...

1252
01:41:34,049 --> 01:41:36,378
...is encourage the army to cross the river.

1253
01:41:36,448 --> 01:41:40,211
Right about here would be convenient.
Start a battle, drain the camp.

1254
01:41:40,615 --> 01:41:42,740
Drop into this flat area.

1255
01:41:42,915 --> 01:41:46,507
While they're fighting, we slip in
from behind, extract cargo and exit.

1256
01:41:46,582 --> 01:41:49,242
Basically, we just call the army,
schedule a battle.

1257
01:41:49,316 --> 01:41:51,838
How would Wednesday
around 3:00 be for you?

1258
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:57,810
We don't call them, mate.
Alice will do it for us.

1259
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:04,340
Can you get a bird? Crew plus seven?

1260
01:42:04,616 --> 01:42:06,707
Are you in love with this woman?

1261
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,772
l don't know
what you're holding out hope for.

1262
01:42:12,849 --> 01:42:15,974
You'll save her husband,
she'll see the light and run off with you?

1263
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:18,675
lt doesn't work that way. You know that.

1264
01:42:24,783 --> 01:42:28,147
l want to cash out of here.
l want my own shop.

1265
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:31,845
lf we could pull this off....

1266
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:34,711
This is the stuff of legends.
We could sell this.

1267
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:38,446
Don't get me wrong.
l would love to go out of here a winner.

1268
01:42:38,849 --> 01:42:43,544
But l have been over this and over this
a thousand times, and it's fucked!

1269
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,247
So we're on, then?

1270
01:42:52,183 --> 01:42:53,672
Absolutely.

1271
01:42:58,717 --> 01:43:00,740
You're gonna have to lie, Alice.

1272
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:03,876
You got to totally bullshit this bastard.

1273
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:07,074
We've got to get the army
to in vade ELTterritory tomorrow.

1274
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:10,311
Peter's life depends on it.
Youjust have to walk in there...

1275
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:13,544
...you walk right up to Fellner
and you flat-out lie.

1276
01:43:13,684 --> 01:43:16,617
Andhe's got to buy it,
or we run out ofoptions.

1277
01:43:19,217 --> 01:43:20,342
Alice...

1278
01:43:20,418 --> 01:43:21,940
...are you...

1279
01:43:22,117 --> 01:43:23,447
...okay?

1280
01:43:24,151 --> 01:43:27,345
ELT wants $1 million for Peter.
We don't have it.

1281
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:29,942
That's a lot of money.

1282
01:43:31,351 --> 01:43:34,011
lf l gave you information
for protecting the pipeline...

1283
01:43:34,085 --> 01:43:36,642
...would Octonal step up
and do the right thing?

1284
01:43:38,618 --> 01:43:41,244
What kind of information
are we talking about?

1285
01:43:44,551 --> 01:43:47,745
Alice, stop! Alonzo, don't go away.
l'll be right back.

1286
01:43:47,918 --> 01:43:49,407
Alice, come on.

1287
01:43:49,718 --> 01:43:53,151
You think l don't wake up every morning
and think about Peter?

1288
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:57,716
l have had a dozen meetings with
the transition team about this situation.

1289
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,418
Just how wrong l think it is.

1290
01:43:59,485 --> 01:44:00,746
Fuck you, Ted.

1291
01:44:02,052 --> 01:44:03,382
Look...

1292
01:44:05,252 --> 01:44:07,684
...l'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

1293
01:44:07,752 --> 01:44:10,149
But you give me something to work with...

1294
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:13,107
...and maybe l can push this the last mile.

1295
01:44:15,519 --> 01:44:17,883
ELT is going after the pipeline tomorrow.

1296
01:44:17,953 --> 01:44:19,282
l know where.

1297
01:44:20,752 --> 01:44:22,775
Do you step up for Peter or not?

1298
01:44:23,452 --> 01:44:26,351
l don't know what you think
you're trying to accomplish...

1299
01:44:26,419 --> 01:44:29,783
...or what you think you know,
or how stupid you think l am...

1300
01:44:29,953 --> 01:44:32,317
...but l get three military briefings a week.

1301
01:44:32,386 --> 01:44:36,613
lt's a good bet that if anyone knew
what was happening here, it would be me.

1302
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:38,280
ls that a no?

1303
01:44:38,353 --> 01:44:40,444
How could you possibly know this?

1304
01:44:48,753 --> 01:44:50,480
And who the hell is that?

1305
01:44:55,386 --> 01:44:58,443
l'm Kessler. Erich Kessler.

1306
01:45:05,787 --> 01:45:08,412
Two phosphorous, two smoke, two HE...

1307
01:45:08,486 --> 01:45:10,214
...two flashbangs per mag.

1308
01:45:18,387 --> 01:45:19,318
G-36.

1309
01:45:19,954 --> 01:45:21,648
But it's a British kick.

1310
01:45:24,387 --> 01:45:26,319
-One day's rations.
-One day?

1311
01:45:28,554 --> 01:45:32,077
l've just come from an urgent sit-down
with our old friend Dover McLoon...

1312
01:45:32,154 --> 01:45:36,519
...at the embassy, who's freaked out today
over a rebel push up towards Rio Verde.

1313
01:45:36,588 --> 01:45:37,815
Nice going, Alice.

1314
01:45:37,888 --> 01:45:39,410
Ready to rock, Terry.

1315
01:45:39,487 --> 01:45:42,317
Kit inspection in 15 minutes.
We're on the bird in an hour.

1316
01:45:42,387 --> 01:45:44,285
You heard the man. Let's go!

1317
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:47,443
Let's go! We've got to move right now.

1318
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:56,911
Don't make me wait. Coming at us.
We got to prep that LZ right now!

1319
01:45:57,422 --> 01:45:59,251
l've never seen you nervous.

1320
01:46:00,754 --> 01:46:02,015
Yes, you have.

1321
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:57,583
l make it 90 to 100.

1322
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:00,049
And that ain't no overnight stay.

1323
01:48:05,058 --> 01:48:06,751
Kessler's map is perfect.

1324
01:48:06,824 --> 01:48:08,381
Peter is the engineer.

1325
01:48:14,858 --> 01:48:16,050
l'm impressed.

1326
01:48:16,124 --> 01:48:17,987
Fellner does have clout.

1327
01:48:18,858 --> 01:48:20,983
ln less than 24 hours, the army...

1328
01:48:21,124 --> 01:48:23,317
...has crossed the river.

1329
01:48:23,792 --> 01:48:25,121
How silly.

1330
01:48:25,191 --> 01:48:26,680
Well, my old mate...

1331
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:30,591
...why don't you wander uptown?

1332
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:32,681
l'll catch you on the flip side.

1333
01:49:31,993 --> 01:49:33,925
Downtown-3 is in position.

1334
01:49:34,826 --> 01:49:36,122
Copy, Downtown-3.

1335
01:49:36,193 --> 01:49:37,853
Downtown-1, stand by.

1336
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:42,254
This is Uptown-1 . We've arrived and
taken our position by the farmhouse, over.

1337
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,418
Uptown-1, this is Downtown-1 .

1338
01:49:44,961 --> 01:49:47,791
Solid visual on the wood shack.
Breakfast in bed for one.

1339
01:49:48,293 --> 01:49:50,452
Appears principal cargo is on board. Over.

1340
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:51,985
Roger that.

1341
01:49:53,627 --> 01:49:55,525
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .

1342
01:49:55,594 --> 01:49:58,788
We have breakfast for three
and delivery in progress.

1343
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:01,553
All call signs, let's go on a final head count.

1344
01:50:01,627 --> 01:50:03,559
Wood shack, one player.

1345
01:50:03,827 --> 01:50:06,453
Red bandanna. POR, door, 6 o'clock.

1346
01:50:07,094 --> 01:50:09,992
Barracks, 3 o'clock, five players. Over.

1347
01:50:10,061 --> 01:50:14,118
Uptown-1 has a two-man detail
on the farm with a possible cargo inside...

1348
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,494
...and...

1349
01:50:15,661 --> 01:50:18,821
...we have a player returning downtown
via the upper path.

1350
01:50:18,894 --> 01:50:22,327
Downtown-1, this is Downtown-3.
Parade ground, 15.

1351
01:50:22,661 --> 01:50:26,058
Copy.
That gives us 21 visuals downtown...

1352
01:50:26,194 --> 01:50:29,160
...two uptown, and one in transit.
24 confirmed.

1353
01:50:29,227 --> 01:50:30,659
Copy, that makes us ready.

1354
01:50:30,728 --> 01:50:33,660
Uptown-1 is good to go.
Standing by, Downtown.

1355
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:00,959
Peter Bowman. Peter Bowman.

1356
01:52:01,697 --> 01:52:03,254
Alice sent me.

1357
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:06,655
Alice, your wife, sent me.

1358
01:52:06,763 --> 01:52:09,457
She told me about Mali, your daughter.
How she died...

1359
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:11,087
...in Africa.

1360
01:52:13,663 --> 01:52:14,993
My daughter?

1361
01:52:15,197 --> 01:52:16,322
Mali.

1362
01:52:18,564 --> 01:52:19,824
Mali.

1363
01:52:20,064 --> 01:52:21,996
Alice told me. Your wife.

1364
01:52:22,064 --> 01:52:23,462
So you would know.

1365
01:52:24,664 --> 01:52:26,653
l'm here to get you home, okay?

1366
01:52:27,164 --> 01:52:28,255
All right?

1367
01:52:28,997 --> 01:52:30,964
You're not fucking with me?

1368
01:52:31,064 --> 01:52:33,690
No, mate. l'm for real.

1369
01:52:34,798 --> 01:52:36,627
We're gonna get out of here.

1370
01:52:38,598 --> 01:52:39,689
All right?

1371
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:42,095
Okay.

1372
01:52:46,898 --> 01:52:49,364
Downtown-2,
you've got a player at 5 o'clock.

1373
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:53,156
What fucking player?

1374
01:53:05,699 --> 01:53:07,597
Softly, mate. Softly.

1375
01:53:20,032 --> 01:53:20,793
Fuck!

1376
01:53:26,066 --> 01:53:27,691
Downtown-1, what the fuck was that?

1377
01:53:28,333 --> 01:53:29,889
All call signs, wait out.

1378
01:53:32,299 --> 01:53:34,231
l repeat. What the fuck was that, Terry?

1379
01:53:34,299 --> 01:53:35,526
Downtown-2?

1380
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:37,558
Downtown-2, respond!

1381
01:53:37,633 --> 01:53:40,326
This is Downtown-2. Not in position.

1382
01:53:43,032 --> 01:53:45,760
l've got a 25th confirmed. Visual.
Downtown-3, 12 o'clock.

1383
01:53:47,099 --> 01:53:48,962
Downtown-1, l got him.

1384
01:53:49,032 --> 01:53:50,123
What are we doing?

1385
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:51,627
Stand by.

1386
01:53:56,166 --> 01:53:57,962
What are we doing here?

1387
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:02,422
Fuck!

1388
01:54:02,666 --> 01:54:04,495
Downtown-1, what are we doing?

1389
01:54:07,866 --> 01:54:09,025
Go loud.

1390
01:54:09,233 --> 01:54:11,131
-Fuck.
-Roger that.

1391
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,556
He's down. Shift, 4 o'clock.

1392
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,623
Can you use one of these?

1393
01:54:27,434 --> 01:54:28,627
Cover me!

1394
01:54:56,068 --> 01:54:57,761
Safety is on! Get down.

1395
01:55:06,034 --> 01:55:08,000
-Ready, Peter?
-l'm with you.

1396
01:55:11,335 --> 01:55:12,494
Back! Back!

1397
01:55:16,702 --> 01:55:18,395
l got the player from the farmhouse.

1398
01:55:18,468 --> 01:55:20,059
l'm shiftingposition.

1399
01:55:20,234 --> 01:55:21,325
Downtown-3!

1400
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:24,265
Give us some pressure at 9 o'clock,
on my count!

1401
01:55:24,335 --> 01:55:26,358
One! Two! Three!

1402
01:55:31,868 --> 01:55:33,527
Peter, go! Stay low.

1403
01:55:41,536 --> 01:55:42,297
Fuck!

1404
01:55:54,469 --> 01:55:56,196
-Peter!
-l'm ready.

1405
01:56:07,070 --> 01:56:08,195
Through there.

1406
01:56:31,503 --> 01:56:32,469
Clear!

1407
01:56:40,604 --> 01:56:42,399
Stay down! Stay down!

1408
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:07,335
-Which way?
-Come on!

1409
01:57:07,404 --> 01:57:10,097
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1 .
We are secure.

1410
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:12,763
On the lower path, l got the cargo in tow.

1411
01:57:12,837 --> 01:57:16,235
We've got bogies up our ass.
Bring the Big Bird to LZ 3.

1412
01:57:16,304 --> 01:57:18,293

We are good to go.

1417
01:57:44,805 --> 01:57:46,294
Safety's off, okay?

01:57:46,372 --> 01:57:47,429
Okay?

1419
01:57:47,838 --> 01:57:49,065
Keep moving.

1420
01:57:52,405 --> 01:57:54,030
What are you doing?

1421
01:57:56,972 --> 01:57:59,939
Keep going down the path!
Follow the path!

1422
01:58:16,106 --> 01:58:18,265
Peter, look at me. Look at me!

You gotta keep going. l know
you're in pain. You've got to keep going.

1424
01:58:21,906 --> 01:58:25,236
Don't let the fuckers catch you.
They'll kill you. Stay on this path.

1425
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:27,635
This path leads to Alice.
This path leads home!

1426
01:58:27,706 --> 01:58:30,002
Stay in front of me. Go!

1427
01:58:42,006 --> 01:58:42,039
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1428
01:58:42,039 --> 01:58:44,130
Terry, what the hell
is going on down there?

1429
01:58:44,206 --> 01:58:46,536
The Big Bird is en route.

1430
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:51,600
lt's okay! Get the camicia up.

1431
01:58:55,473 --> 01:58:56,905
Terry, where are you?

1432
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,166
Downtown-1 is traveling well.

1433
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,831
We've got a visual on the bird.
We're coming in.

1434
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:13,329
You big, beautiful bitch!

1435
01:59:14,374 --> 01:59:15,772
There she is!

1436
01:59:15,940 --> 01:59:17,338
You want to go home?

1437
01:59:18,641 --> 01:59:20,504
You're going home, baby!

1438
01:59:43,741 --> 01:59:44,866
Uptown-1.

1439
01:59:44,941 --> 01:59:46,464
This is Downtown-2.

1440
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:49,167
l have a man down. Downtown-3 is down!

1441
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:50,670

1442
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:52,832
lrepeat, Downtown-3 is down.

1443
01:59:53,642 --> 01:59:54,539
Fuck!

Give me that fucking thing!

1445
01:59:56,941 --> 01:59:57,771

1446
01:59:58,508 --> 01:59:59,405
Five!

1447
02:00:03,709 --> 02:00:05,265
Downtown-2...

1448
02:00:05,442 --> 02:00:06,703
...l'm on my way.

1449
02:00:09,675 --> 02:00:11,470
Downtown-1, this is Uptown-1.

02:00:11,542 --> 02:00:13,906
l've got a man down.
Downtown-3 is down.

1451
02:00:14,176 --> 02:00:17,869
l'm going back to get him.
Uptown-2has my cargo on the bird.

1452
02:00:17,942 --> 02:00:20,772
We 'llbe evacuating Downtown-3

1454
02:00:24,475 --> 02:00:26,442
Roger that. l'm at the LZ.

1455
02:00:26,508 --> 02:00:28,770
Got an eye on the bird, my cargo is in tow.

1456
02:00:28,842 --> 02:00:30,433
My back door is clear.

1457
02:00:30,909 --> 02:00:32,466
lf you need help, give me a yell.

1458
02:00:35,942 --> 02:00:37,499
Look out, grenade!

1459
02:00:50,743 --> 02:00:52,004
Juaco!

1465
02:01:17,210 --> 02:01:19,608
Are you crazy?
Get on that fucking chopper now!

1466
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:27,272
Eyewash! Give me some eyewash!

1467
02:01:33,444 --> 02:01:35,273
He needs something for his eyes.

1468
02:01:36,777 --> 02:01:38,107
He needs it now.

1469
02:01:39,078 --> 02:01:40,373
He's alive!

1470
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:42,876
lt's right here.

1471
02:01:45,111 --> 02:01:47,702
Carlos, look at me. Who am l?

1472
02:01:47,777 --> 02:01:50,243
-You're an asshole.
-That's fucking right!

1473
02:01:56,078 --> 02:01:57,635
Are you all right?

1474
02:01:58,078 --> 02:02:01,476
Don't you fucking die on me, man!
l can't tell on you....

1475
02:02:01,545 --> 02:02:03,238
He always does this shit!

1476
02:02:03,311 --> 02:02:05,936
You're a pussy! He's a fucking pussy, man!

1477
02:02:16,712 --> 02:02:18,200
How is it?

1478
02:02:23,645 --> 02:02:24,975
Who are you?

1479
02:02:26,378 --> 02:02:27,776
Terry Thorne.

1480
02:02:29,812 --> 02:02:31,244
How's my wife?

1481
02:02:31,778 --> 02:02:32,971
She okay?

1482
02:02:33,745 --> 02:02:37,269
She misses you.
She's waiting for you where we land.

1483
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,777
Welcome home!

1484
02:03:23,113 --> 02:03:24,773
Keep your head down.

1485
02:03:36,714 --> 02:03:38,111
Hello, Alice.

1486
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:44,778
You all right?

1487
02:04:18,848 --> 02:04:20,007
Sandro!

1488
02:04:30,414 --> 02:04:31,778
-Hi.
-Hi.

1489
02:04:31,848 --> 02:04:33,314
You look great.

1490
02:04:49,215 --> 02:04:50,772
l need one minute.

1491
02:04:53,315 --> 02:04:54,372
Okay.

1492
02:05:08,249 --> 02:05:10,646
-We did it.
-You did it.

1493
02:05:11,349 --> 02:05:13,440
You know, you better get going.

1494
02:05:13,616 --> 02:05:15,912
We could be very unpopular
around here in the future.

1495
02:05:15,983 --> 02:05:17,710
-l thought we'd get a chance--
-What?

1496
02:05:17,782 --> 02:05:20,248
To sit around and chat? The three of us?

1497
02:05:20,483 --> 02:05:23,574
There's a 6:00 American flight to Dallas.
You can make it.

1498
02:05:23,649 --> 02:05:25,616
There's a passport in the Jeep for Peter.

1499
02:05:25,683 --> 02:05:28,080
Norma will pack the house.
She'll send everything up.

1500
02:05:28,149 --> 02:05:30,876
His leg looks bad but it can wait till Dallas.

1501
02:05:30,949 --> 02:05:32,347
This is important.

1502
02:05:33,049 --> 02:05:34,606
No telephone calls...

1503
02:05:34,683 --> 02:05:38,479
...no high-fives, no champagne.
You get to the airport...

1504
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:40,516
...and you make that plane.

1505
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:44,076
Just tell me
you know how much you mean to me.

1506
02:05:47,017 --> 02:05:48,277
So we're even.

1507
02:05:50,184 --> 02:05:51,877
No, we'll never be even.

1508
02:05:53,583 --> 02:05:55,106
l've given you...

1509
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:58,049
-...nothing.
-Believe me, we're even.

1510
02:06:00,217 --> 02:06:02,183
You deserve more than this.

1511
02:06:02,650 --> 02:06:04,549
You got a plane to catch.

1512
02:06:06,683 --> 02:06:08,945
l'll see you around, Mrs. Bowman.

1513
02:06:56,951 --> 02:06:59,315
Get my Duke Ellington records.
Get me the Scotch.

1514
02:06:59,385 --> 02:07:03,442
The good shit. Twelve-year-old, not crap.
Remember the encrypted phone.

1515
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:05,241
Take care, Alice.

1516
02:07:07,685 --> 02:07:09,708
Who's the man?

1517
02:07:09,785 --> 02:07:12,546
Stuff of legends. You are the man.

1518
02:07:12,619 --> 02:07:15,676
Sandro,
we've got to get to the airport fast.

1519
02:07:15,785 --> 02:07:17,717
We've got a flight in an hour.

1520
02:07:28,586 --> 02:07:29,881
We made it.

1521
02:07:34,952 --> 02:07:36,009
Yeah.

1522
02:07:36,686 --> 02:07:38,117
Let's go home.

1523
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:46,045
You and me, we open our own shop.
l run New York, you run London.

1524
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:49,779
We meet in the Caymans once a month
to visit our money.

1525
02:07:50,987 --> 02:07:53,282
Strictly white glove. Lots of long lunches.

1526
02:07:53,353 --> 02:07:56,478
No more fucking frontlines.
Some consulting, some policies...

1527
02:07:56,553 --> 02:08:00,111
...and we give lan a heart attack
before we open the doors.

1528
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:07,781
l don't know if l want you
visiting my money.
