1
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,327
Fifty years ago

2
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,597
Paris was a light-hearted city

3
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,003
the goal of many a traveler

4
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,905
but some came not
for gaiety but to work

5
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,241
to study at one of the world's
most famous university

6
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,939
the Sorban.

7
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,074
To its lecture room and classes

8
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,618
came students
from all over the world

9
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,348
and among them was a young girl.

10
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,391
She was poor. She was beautiful.

11
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,960
She had left her
homeland and family

12
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,429
and here in Paris, she was alone

13
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,434
haunted by
dreams and invincibly eager

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,438
To go out alone into space.
Go out alone.

15
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,167
In one hundred years

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,711
one hundred students
but when it is time

17
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,838
for you to think

18
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,916
you, too, will be alone

19
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,044
like the author of this equation
like Newton

20
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,850
let us say your Galileo.

21
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:09,621
Probably will not be your
good fortune to reach the sky

22
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,856
to catch the stars
in your fingertips.

23
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,332
To catch a star
in your fingertips.

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,994
But this you can share with them.

25
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,803
You can learn to
be alone with nature

26
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,537
with the ray of light
piece of earth

27
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,046
drop of rain
you can become aware

28
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,515
that the earth's swirling
about the sun

29
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,985
at the rate of
66,000 miles per hour.

30
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,646
Aware that the...

31
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,092
What... what's that?

32
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,527
You are feeling better? Sit.

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,572
Sit still a moment. You fainted.

34
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,699
I... I’m sorry I interrupted
the lecture so stupidly.

35
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,677
You can get the notes
from some other students.

36
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,646
Your name is Marie Scholoscka?

37
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,479
Yes. You are working
in two master degrees.

38
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,985
One in physics and one in mathematics.

39
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,249
You passed first in the...

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,724
mathematical examination
last year.

41
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,725
What did you have to eat today?

42
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,358
Eat?

43
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,093
Yes, eat.

44
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,764
I don't remember.
I have some lunch.

45
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,966
What did you have?

46
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,904
Salmon. All sort of things.

47
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,606
You have a pleasant room?

48
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,376
Yes, monsieur.

49
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,678
Good.

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,219
What time did you have that coat

51
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,151
Come along.

52
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,996
Come along, please.

53
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,345
This is rather unusual to have no
friends here in Paris.

54
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,815
I have little time for friends.

55
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,251
Usually, there's some young men.

56
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,889
I'm interested in physics
and mathematics.

57
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,926
Yes, so am I.

58
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,393
Yet, I have a wife and a home

59
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,988
a daughter
and two granddaughters

60
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,329
I'm afraid
I will not be up to that.

61
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,031
Your desire is to
go back to Poland and teach?

62
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,299
Yes.

63
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,773
Your parents are still in Warsaw

64
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,006
My father is a physics professor
He is old.

65
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,981
When I have my degrees
I shall go back and live with him.

66
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,608
You love Poland.

67
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,744
Oh, yes. I love Poland.

68
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:53,848
Physics and
mathematics and Poland.

69
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,858
Yes.

70
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,088
Eat your soup.

71
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,167
Thank you very much.

72
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,004
The Society of Natural Industry
has asked me

73
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,304
to recommend someone

74
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:17,314
to make a study of the magnetic
property of rare steel.

75
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,817
I would be glad to recommend you
if you wish.

76
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,217
There would be some
cumbersome costs

77
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,689
I don't know exactly what.
Oh, it wouldn't matter.

78
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,293
Really it wouldn't.
I would be so grateful.

79
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,864
Of course, that our cumbersome
equipment too cumbersome

80
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,364
for our laboratories, I'm afraid.

81
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,163
However, I know a scientist
of great merit

82
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,738
who works in the school
of physics and chemistry.

83
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,307
Perhaps he might have
recommendation available.

84
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,708
Come and have tea Sunday
with my wife and me.

85
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,041
I will ask him to come, too.

86
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,585
You probably know his name.
It is Pierre Curie.

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,211
Oh, thank you so much. Thank you

88
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,653
You have been very kind.

89
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,224
Not at all. Not at all.

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,419
Good bye then. Until Sunday.

91
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,928
Sunday. Good night.

92
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:05,996
Good night.

93
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,817
To catch a star
at your fingertips.

94
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,954
Ah. Madame Poirot.

95
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,117
You are Mdme. Scholoscka.
I knew it.

96
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,159
Yes.

97
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,421
We've been waiting for you.

98
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:20,361
My husband has told me
all about you.

99
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,469
Ah. Professor Curie. How nice?

100
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,467
Madame.

101
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,003
You two had met?

102
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,402
Have not had the honor
in the hallway.

103
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:33,638
This is Mdme. Marie Scholoscka.
professor Pierre Curie.

104
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,407
My husband said
you have no friends in Paris

105
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,346
but that's impossible, child

106
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,452
We must remedy that.
Please Professor...

107
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,919
Come in. Come in.
I'm sure you know everyone here.

108
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,422
In Paris
you must have many friends.

109
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,027
I want you to meet
all these charming...

110
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:54,328
May I introduce you to...
This is Mdme. Scholoscka...

111
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,898
What time?
Always hard to meet, gentlemen.

112
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,097
Dr. Curie

113
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,900
Good afternoon.

114
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,740
I had no idea that
it was going to be a party.

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,848
No... I believe you, monsieur.

116
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,416
They're pulling up suddenly
these parties

117
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,713
out of the goodness of
women's hearts.

118
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,847
My wife wishes the young student
of mine to make many friends.

119
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,425
Well, I... I'm very bad
at parties.

120
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,188
It's impossible for me to focus.

121
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,765
My mind won't follow the
most simple thought.

122
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,730
Oh, I beg your pardon.

123
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,859
You are quite alright.

124
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,665
Maybe I'll come back
some other day.

125
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,470
No... I want to talk to you
about this student of mine.

126
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,579
Perhaps we can find
a quiet corner

127
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,941
where we can talk.

128
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,241
Of course. Of course.

129
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,676
And as this student has
very little money, and is

130
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,756
I believe, extremely talented

131
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,553
I thought you might have
room available

132
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,525
at physics and chemistry.

133
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,220
Oh, I should be very glad.

134
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,764
Unfortunately at the moment
we are extremely

135
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,924
crowded ourselves.

136
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,057
In that case...

137
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,932
However, my workroom is
quite large.

138
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,905
I would hesitate to ask you
to share your own laboratory...

139
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,770
I have shared it
with students before.

140
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,808
You have?

141
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,344
Yes, and some of them were
very quiet and pleasant.

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,779
On the other hand
one fellow was most troublesome.

143
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,283
He used to whistle constantly.

144
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,877
Well, I can assure you that
this student is very serious.

145
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,490
Then I should be very happy.

146
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,425
I think you will find that
she is very sincere.

147
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,361
She?

148
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:36,264
Oh, my God.
These are my granddaughters.

149
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,369
Excuse me.

150
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,733
But...

151
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,705
Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle.

152
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,106
Bon Appetit. A coffee?

153
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,804
Yes, thank you. Tea.

154
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,879
That's coffee.

155
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,482
That's coffee, too.

156
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,449
Oh.

157
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,713
Please sit down, everybody.

158
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,914
Sit down. Wait a moment.

159
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,617
Come along... children.
It's time for your performance.

160
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,523
Would you excuse them, Dr. Curie.

161
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,289
They are going to play the piano.

162
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,491
Come along... There they are.

163
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,201
This is the student of whom
we were speaking.

164
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,777
Mme. Scholoscka.
Dr. Pierre Curie.

165
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,900
We have already met.

166
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,014
Dr. Curie is gracious
in consenting

167
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,013
for you to work
in his laboratory

168
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,947
I am very grateful.

169
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,814
Of course, I have no idea
that is...

170
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,013
Would you sit down, Madame?

171
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,954
Oh, would you please excuse me.

172
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,550
I feel my grandchildren are about
to entertain.

173
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,795
Would you care for tea?

174
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,927
Thank you. I've just had some.

175
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,974
It's coffee.

176
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,053
I appreciate very deeply
Dr. Curie

177
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,059
the privilege of working in
your laboratory.

178
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,751
Playing incredibly badly
don't you think?

179
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,791
Very badly, Dr. Curie.

180
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,929
Of course, I'm no judge.

181
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,862
Professor Poirot is an
excellent scientist.

182
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,250
Oh, good morning, Dr. Curie.

183
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,614
Good morning, David.

184
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,221
The furnace is taken down

185
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,189
and I'm beginning to set up
for room temperature readings.

186
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,259
I have the sulphates
all ready for you.

187
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,659
Thank you.
No one has arrived yet?

188
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,163
Here at the laboratory? Yes.

189
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,665
No, sir.
Are you expecting someone?

190
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,293
Well, a pupil of Dr. Poirot

191
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,167
who's going to do some work here
for a short time.

192
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,274
Yes, sir.

193
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,673
Her name is Marie Sc...

194
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,009
Funny, I was introduced
to her twice.

195
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,278
Scholoscka.

196
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,378
She's a girl.

197
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,019
I didn't find out in time.

198
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,152
Always the continuous struggle
against woman, David

199
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,458
When we wish to give
all our thoughts to some work

200
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,157
which is strangest to humanity

201
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,132
we always have to
struggle against woman.

202
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,534
Yes, sir. And women scientists
are particularly unattractive

203
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,605
I find, sir

204
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,401
Women's love in life is the
living of it.

205
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,100
In the world of
abstract research

206
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,643
she's a danger, destruction.

207
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,747
She's a natural enemy of science

208
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,473
There's no doubt of it, sir.

209
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,914
Woman and science are
incompatible.

210
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,180
Woman of genius are rare.

211
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,483
No true scientist
can have anything with women.

212
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,682
No, sir.

213
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,591
Anyway, David, put her over there
in that far corner.

214
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,627
Yes, sir.

215
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,560
And if you can
without being rude

216
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,897
inform her how important silence
is to laboratory work.

217
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,403
I do hope she doesn't whistle.
Oh, David.

218
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,371
Would you mind going to
the storeroom upstairs

219
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,634
and see
if there's a magnetometer.

220
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,141
She'll need
one for her experiments.

221
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,609
Oh, yes.

222
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,647
I... I'm very sorry, sir.

223
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,171
I beg your pardon
are you looking for something?

224
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,576
Yes. I'm looking for
Dr. Curie's laboratory.

225
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,272
You're here. But you're not...

226
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,008
I mean you can't be...
Excuse me, please.

227
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,277
No. You don't understand.

228
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,909
You see
I'm Dr. Curie's assistant.

229
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,318
Oh... then you can direct me.

230
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,480
Oh, I certainly can.

231
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,489
Certainly can.

232
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,355
Oh, just this way.
Thank you.

233
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,655
What do you think of that?

234
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,627
I run into you the first thing.

235
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,995
You know, Dr. Curie has asked me
look out for you.

236
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,567
Be sure to have
everything you want

237
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,364
so I'll just take everything
into my own hands.

238
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,972
Oh, here we are.

239
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,575
Here she is, Dr. Curie.

240
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,770
Run straight
into her the first day.

241
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,281
Oh. Good morning, Mademoiselle.

242
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,010
Good morning, Dr. Curie.

243
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,781
This time we met in rather a
less rude atmosphere.

244
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:57,752
Yes.

245
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,515
Well
that's just as it should be.

246
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,989
People interested in work
should be left alone.

247
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,684
You have met my assistant?

248
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,296
Yes. I don't think
I quite caught his name.

249
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,956
David. David Lagroue.

250
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,091
I'm sure that
David will see that

251
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,532
you're properly installed.

252
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,467
Thank you, Dr. Curie.

253
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,596
I appreciate this chance
more than I can say.

254
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,402
Not at all
Not at all, Mademoiselle

255
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,103
and I do hope
you'll be quite comfortable.

256
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,238
Over this way.

257
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,940
We picked out
a specially nice place

258
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,142
for you right over here.

259
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,776
You're going to have this
far corner all to yourself.

260
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,855
Of course
we would have it fixed up

261
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,753
for you had we known sooner
that you were coming

262
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,655
but we'll take care of
that right away.

263
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,421
How do you think
this is going to suit you?

264
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,757
Oh. It is excellent.

265
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,058
I understand you're a pupil of
Professor Poirot's?

266
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,859
Yes.

267
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,093
I've studied with him, too.

268
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,133
Wonderful isn't he?

269
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,601
Yes, he is. Oh, I'll give you
a little more light.

270
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,535
Please don't bother.

271
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,607
Oh, Dr. Curie wants you
to be comfortable.

272
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,879
I'm sorry, Dr. Curie.

273
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,075
Here's a paper and pencil.

274
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,015
You can make out a list for
all the things you need,

275
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:01,949
and I'll go and see

276
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,577
if I can get
a magnetometer for you.

277
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,116
Oh, I can take my coat off?

278
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,486
Oh. It's always
the way you should.

279
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,593
Your hat?

280
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,922
I'll hide it up
at the cupboard for you

281
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,095
I'm sorry, Dr. Curie.

282
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,677
Let me help you.

283
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,909
Thank you.

284
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,145
You know
my office is just upstairs.

285
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,948
I hope you won't
hesitate to call on me

286
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,386
if I can be of any assistance.

287
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,752
You're very kind.

288
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,219
You sure everything's alright?

289
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,329
Quite. Thank you.

290
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,361
Not at all.

291
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,694
If there is anything you'd like

292
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:50,859
to know about our equipment

293
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,664
I'd be glad to explain it to you

294
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,251
I want to give you some advice
on where to eat around here.

295
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,481
There's a very nice
little restaurant down...

296
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,591
Really, monsieur.
I don't think we should talk.

297
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,783
Why are you whispering?

298
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,326
I just think
you ought to know where to go.

299
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,258
Yes, but I...

300
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,330
I'll take you there later.
That's the best way and

301
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,432
It's too trouble.

302
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,935
Oh, no trouble at all.
I'll come back for you.

303
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,410
Good evening, Mademoiselle.

304
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,810
Good evening, Dr. Curie.

305
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,041
Miserable evening, hasn't it?

306
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,879
Yes, isn't it.

307
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,509
Oh, by the way
did David get you the

308
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,781
telescope scale
you asked for last week

309
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,151
Oh, yes. Thank you very much.

310
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,258
He finally look into it.

311
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,156
Good... Well, good evening.

312
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,935
But you have no umbrella
Mademoiselle

313
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,265
No, I haven't, Dr. Curie.

314
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,169
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

315
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,275
Perhaps I can help you.

316
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,603
Oh, I don't want to trouble you.

317
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,005
Allow me. No trouble at all.

318
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:13,907
No trouble at all.

319
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,138
Thank you.

320
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,112
You're very kind.

321
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,685
Not at all, Mademoiselle.

322
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,121
May I ask you another question

323
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,985
Dr. Curie
in the same connection?

324
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,083
It's a simple matter, perhaps
but it puzzles me.

325
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,696
Yes, Mademoiselle?

326
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,357
In the semetry
L sub-Q and two L sub-Q

327
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,161
you include only those rotations

328
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,533
which are integral multiples
of two Pi L Q.

329
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,436
But two times
K over Q exclude

330
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,008
the identity transformation

331
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,611
if K is not an integer.

332
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,442
Yes. For final case, I guess.

333
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,882
But in a limited L sub infinity
a difficult seems to arise.

334
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,580
I don't see why it's
quite straightforward.

335
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:01,819
Well, if you consider the
matter rigorously...

336
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,895
Hmm. I have to look into that.

337
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,461
This is where I lived.

338
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,797
Good bye and thank you.

339
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,032
Of course...

340
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,642
Oh, good bye, mademoiselle.

341
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,977
And may I say your conversation
is very simplely

342
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,175
Thank you.

343
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,592
It's an extremely
dawning hypothesis.

344
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,052
Good morning, Mademoiselle.

345
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,816
Good morning, Dr. Curie.

346
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,083
I'm a little late this morning.

347
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,556
I have to stop
in at my publishers.

348
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,661
Oh.

349
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,223
To Mme. Scholoscka

350
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,162
my respect and
friendship of honor...

351
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,528
friendship of honor.

352
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,837
My book.

353
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:28,004
Oh, it's lovely.

354
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,910
One of the first copy
just off the press.

355
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,351
On semitry and
physical phenomena

356
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,954
Semitry of Electric Field

357
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,617
and of Magnetic Field
by Pierre curie.

358
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,320
That's something to be proud of.

359
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,792
I thought perhaps you might
like a copy.

360
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,300
Oh, I would very much.

361
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,165
Well, it's yours. It's yours
Mademoiselle.

362
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,034
Oh, thank you.

363
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,231
Not at all.

364
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,616
I've inscribed the book for you
mademoiselle

365
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,953
on the ply leaf.

366
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,357
I believe
that's the usual procedure.

367
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,759
I'm very flattered.

368
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,425
Not at all...

369
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,853
Come in. Oh, Dr. Becquerel.

370
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,759
I hope I'm not intruding
Dr. Curie.

371
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,093
But could you step over
my laboratory with me?

372
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,224
I think I've happened on something
of great interest.

373
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,267
Why? What is it?

374
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,427
Are you too busy to...?

375
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,971
Oh, no... Not at all.
I'll come at once.

376
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,103
Oh, aren't you coming
Mademoiselle?

377
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,038
Well, if I may?

378
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:05,802
You don't mind...

379
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,172
No. No. I'll be delighted.

380
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:09,041
I came upon it quite by accident

381
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,649
I think you'll agree that it is
very extraordinary...

382
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,613
What is this thing...

383
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,383
Well, what did you see?

384
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,919
You have taken
the picture of a key apparently.

385
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,649
Yes, the picture of a key.

386
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,122
But that picture
of a key was taken...

387
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,387
in a very extraordinary manner.

388
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,589
The picture of that key
was taken
in complete and total darkness

389
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,893
without light of any kind.

390
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,435
But, how was that possible?

391
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,469
Some months ago

392
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,631
I had the idea that perhaps
certain rocks and minerals

393
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,470
might store applied energy
from the sun

394
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,838
that if I left
the rocks and minerals

395
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,104
in the sun long enough

396
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,508
they might absorbed
some of its rays

397
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,114
and then later, give them out.

398
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,240
So I make some
photographic experiments

399
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,510
You see these rocks

400
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,483
they're all different kinds
of minerals

401
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,747
I labeled them as you see

402
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,187
and left them outside
in the sun for several hours.

403
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,759
Then I put them in this drawer

404
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,953
on photographic plates like this

405
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,358
and then I waited to see

406
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,692
if they would give out
any sunlight

407
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,026
they might have absorbed.

408
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,828
I see. And your experiment
was a success.

409
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,733
To the contrary, my experiment
was a complete failure.

410
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,669
Not one of the rocks
I have exposed to the sun

411
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,035
affected the plates in anyway.

412
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,233
See, there they are.
They're all black

413
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,104
every one of them.

414
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:13,040
Then how did you explain...

415
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,668
Now, look at this one, please.

416
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,707
That has been exposed
am I right?

417
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,009
Light has reached

418
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,947
Oh, yes. That has been exposed.

419
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,988
This plate was lying
in this drawer quite by accident.

420
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:26,556
I didn't even know it was there.

421
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,023
It's the drawer that I keep
some of my specimens in.

422
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,094
And when I was putting my rocks
back into the drawer

423
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,060
one of them must have fallen
on this plate

424
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,290
without my knowing it.

425
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,024
I discovered it yesterday.

426
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,796
This is the rock that
I have not yet exposed to the sun

427
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,271
it's a piece of mineral
called pitch blende.

428
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,870
To be sure
there could be no mistake

429
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,411
last night I myself
hide in this room

430
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,741
in complete darkness.

431
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,213
Took this rock, which had never
been exposed to the sun

432
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,786
and placed it
on a photographic plate.

433
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,451
I put this metal key
between the stone

434
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,321
and the plate like this

435
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,825
so that it would be photographed

436
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,021
if any light rays
came from the stone.

437
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,732
Half hour ago
I developed the plate.

438
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,595
This is the result.

439
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,433
You mean, then, that...

440
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,474
there is something about that rock

441
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,236
that gives off rays of its own.

442
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,971
Rays powerful enough to go
through black paper

443
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,512
and affect this photographic plate.

444
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,980
That, Monsieur, must be so.

445
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:26,947
Incredible.

446
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,177
It is incredible.

447
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,588
It's as if they were
a piece of the sun

448
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,918
locked up in here.

449
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,656
Strange. Very strange.

450
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,232
What could it be? What could be
the nature of radiation?

451
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,266
What could be the origin of it?

452
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,199
Perhaps we shall never know.

453
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,635
It was very kind of you
to take me

454
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,672
to Dr. Becquerel's laboratory.

455
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,605
Not at all...

456
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,370
Dr. Curie

457
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,069
I want to thank you
also for allowing me

458
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,511
to do my experiments here
in your laboratory.

459
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,139
I couldn't have done this
if it weren't

460
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,251
for Natural Science Industry

461
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,613
for allowing me of your kindness.

462
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:02,777
You finished that already?

463
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,354
Yes, I had to do it quickly

464
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,252
because I should not
have much time from now on

465
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,551
to come to the laboratory.

466
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,751
Why? What do you mean?

467
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,658
From now on, I shall spend
most of my time studying.

468
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,198
My examination's coming up
in less than two weeks, you know.

469
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,461
So soon? I haven't realized.

470
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,264
Yes. I have been here
six months.

471
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,702
It's the middle of June.

472
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,432
The term is nearly over.

473
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,543
How fast it goes.

474
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,541
Yes.

475
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,772
You know a short time ago
that tree was a skeleton.

476
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,576
I always used to look forward
to my summer in my country

477
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,184
but I'm only there
at stray moments now

478
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,150
when I go to visit my parents.

479
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,687
They have this small place
outside of Paris at Sol.

480
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,087
I used to take long walks
towards the woods there

481
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,126
with my brother, Jacques.

482
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,990
So nice to be walking
in the country.

483
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,654
My father loves to walk.

484
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,130
Your father?
Is he here in Paris?

485
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,427
Oh, no. In Warsaw

486
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,559
but we get out of the city
now and then.

487
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,867
Warsaw. But you're not thinking
going to Warsaw.

488
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,701
Of course.

489
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,569
But when?

490
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,971
As soon as
I finished my examinations.

491
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,838
But for how long?

492
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,879
Why for... Why, Dr. Curie.

493
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,277
You forget that if I passed
my examinations

494
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,883
I'm going back to Poland
to teach.

495
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,508
Well, I knew that...
wish I knew when we first came,

496
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:09,745
but everything is changed now.

497
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,446
You are making experiments
of your own

498
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,318
I know it.
I shall miss Paris, too.

499
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,323
But this is absurd, fantastic.

500
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,427
Why, it never occurred to me.

501
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,722
Oh, I...
I haven't planned on this at all.

502
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,990
How could you dream of
doing such a thing

503
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,966
abandoning science
when your making such progress.

504
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,401
My father is getting old.
He misses me.

505
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,801
If you stay on in Poland

506
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,669
you can't possibly go on
with your studies.

507
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,504
Anyone can teach
but you can do more

508
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,303
much more.

509
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,413
You have a talent
a definite talent

510
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,775
and it's your duty to use it.

511
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,041
We've so much to be done

512
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,014
so much to
that's still undreamed of.

513
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,383
Oh, Mademoiselle.
I beg you to reconsider.

514
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,252
Why, that's very kind of you
Dr. Curie

515
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,451
I'm really flattered.

516
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,858
I'm afraid
I can't give up the entire plan

517
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,987
that I have had for so long.

518
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,395
I thought, of course, you knew.

519
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,965
I do not understand

520
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,568
how anyone
with a scientific mind

521
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,609
can entertain the thought of
abandoning science.

522
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,612
I know.
But there are other things

523
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,749
that are important, too.

524
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,233
Dr. Curie?

525
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,095
Yes, Mademoiselle.

526
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,133
I've been meaning to ask you.

527
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,931
I supposed you wouldn't care
to attend my graduation?

528
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,903
Well, I should enjoy very much

529
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,374
seeing you get your degree
but, well, I have, ah...

530
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,070
there's such a crowd always.

531
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,771
Of course...
I understand perfectly.

532
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,780
I feel exactly
the same way myself.

533
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,714
Well
I should be coming in again

534
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,412
of course to see to a few things

535
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,045
Good bye, Dr. Curie.

536
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,316
Good bye, Mademoiselle.

537
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,192
We may well expect to hear
again and again.

538
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,430
It will always be
interested for you to look back

539
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,837
and try to recall
the personality of...

540
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,842
your classmate
who have won faith.

541
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,538
Above all
it's the mother of learning

542
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,878
And her children come through
all the corners of the world.

543
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,077
They come, they are nourished

544
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,711
and then
they returned to their homeland

545
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:29,259
to impart what
they have instilled to others.

546
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:32,830
Pride is not deflated by
what they take away.

547
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:37,060
The whole world is in fact
enriched by what they learned.

548
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:41,332
And am proud in particular gained
more than she gives

549
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,872
to the very earnest students.

550
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:48,377
Professor Constance, chairman of
the committee on scholarship

551
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,413
has gone over all the awards

552
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,915
and will read the name
of the successful candidates.

553
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,954
It is my pleasure to introduce
Professor Constance.

554
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,057
The names of those who have been
awarded degrees

555
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,030
will be read
in the order of merit.

556
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,965
For the degree
the master of physics.

557
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,661
First...

558
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,670
Marie Scholoscka.

559
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,231
Hello, Dr. Curie.

560
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,361
Oh, hello, David.

561
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,236
Isn't she wonderful?
First place in physics.

562
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,606
Did you know we have that
all that time in the laboratory?

563
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,508
Yes. It's very gratifying.

564
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:56,671
Here she was bright...

565
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,146
You haven't seen any of
Mmde. Scholoscka, have you, David?

566
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,218
Yes, I saw her.
Had a nice talk with her.

567
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,979
Congratulated her and everything.

568
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,521
She went straight home.
Had some packing to do.

569
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,487
Packing?

570
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,455
Well, she's leaving for Poland
on Tuesday.

571
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,855
Oh.

572
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,792
Good bye, Dr. Curie. Oh.
Awfully glad I run into you.

573
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,922
Good bye, David.

574
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,091
Ah! Dr. Curie.

575
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,202
How do you do, Professor?

576
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,598
Lovely, wasn't it?

577
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,831
Packing.
Yes... Wasn't it lovely?

578
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,458
Come in...

579
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,572
Dr. Curie.

580
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,471
How do you do?

581
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,203
I missed you at the
Graduation Exercises.

582
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,143
I looked all over for you.

583
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,248
You were there?

584
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,178
Yes.

585
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,112
Then you heard.

586
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,083
Yes. My congratulation
Mademoiselle.

587
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,656
Thank you. You know, I was...
never dreamed that I would...

588
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,315
I was even afraid that I might
may not...

589
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,623
Oh, I'm glad you were able to go.

590
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,424
Won't you sit down?

591
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,395
Thank you

592
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,100
I met David and he told me that

593
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,296
you were leaving Poland
on Tuesday

594
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,167
Yes.

595
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:30,274
I see.

596
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,706
Then you haven't reconsider
Mademoiselle.

597
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,004
I'm afraid not.

598
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,445
Of course. Of course.
Perhaps you might have.

599
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,313
You were packing?

600
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,316
Yes.

601
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,253
Oh, yes... naturally.
Well, then...

602
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,518
since you are leaving
so soon on Tuesday

603
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,824
I presume there'd be no time for
something I had in mind,

604
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,157
that is...

605
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,564
my father...

606
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,796
He is a doctor, you know.

607
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,305
He is very short only, you know.
but intelligent.

608
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,069
And my mother is quite gay.

609
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,610
I think you'd enjoy knowing
both of them.

610
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,214
But of course that would be
impossible

611
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:15,911
because you'd be busy packing and
doing one thing or another.

612
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,681
I had meant to
ask you down before

613
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,653
but it slipped my mind.

614
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,759
Still, I thought it would be nice

615
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,351
for you to take away with you
some of Paris' countryside

616
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,327
since we were speaking of
the country

617
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,262
the last time I saw you

618
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,231
that perhaps you might like
to come with me

619
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,563
to spend the weekend there.

620
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,764
It's not far
but still it's impossible

621
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,967
I see, because, I said before

622
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,876
you'd be busy packing
and preparing for your journey.

623
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:47,348
Yes, the idea's preposterous
on the face of it.

624
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,046
The idea is not
preposterous at all.

625
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,784
I should like to come very much.

626
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,154
You would?

627
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,286
Yes. Thank you.

628
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,526
Well, then.

629
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,566
Well, then.

630
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,673
I hate that girl.

631
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,036
Eugene.

632
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,280
I still hate that girl.
What do you do in Poland, anyway?

633
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,545
Spend all your time
at this stupid game

634
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,177
You must not mind my husband.

635
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,290
He never shouts at anyone
unless he likes them.

636
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,413
That's what I thought.

637
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,459
He had been shouting at me
all my life.

638
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,459
Well, what are looking
so gloomy about, Pierre.

639
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,792
It's your shot.

640
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:35,990
Ah, yes. Excuse me.

641
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,034
I heard you're going to Poland
on Tuesday.

642
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,136
Say, Monsieur.

643
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,396
Excellent country, Poland.

644
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,527
Thank you.

645
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:43,367
Of course, he hasn't been there.

646
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,497
You don't have to be there

647
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,836
to know
it's an excellent country.

648
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,239
Well, what are you waiting for.

649
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,675
Hit it. Hit it.

650
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,610
Well, I dare say
it's the best thing you can do.

651
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,648
You can go on
with your studies there.

652
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,149
Of course, not with a degree that
you could get here,

653
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,311
but you will do well
whatever it is.

654
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,945
Thank you, Madame.

655
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,853
I'm not paying you compliments.

656
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,825
I'm only telling you what I see
in your face.

657
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,861
It's all there
in people's faces.

658
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,191
Look at my husband.

659
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,233
A good man and a good doctor.
Look at Pierre.

660
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:13,997
A poet, but a poet with brains.

661
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,231
A poet in the laboratory.

662
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:20,674
Look at me, fat and foolish
but quite a good old soul.

663
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,608
It's true. Why should I mind.

664
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,647
Look at Monsieur and me.

665
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,218
Mitchell there
and young Master Mitchell.

666
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,252
We'll let them pass.

667
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,913
But then, look at yours.

668
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:36,049
Stubborn, determined, abstinent

669
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,855
and of course, intelligent.

670
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,761
And then, there's something else
that I can't quite

671
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:44,493
give a name to. Fiery, is it?

672
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:49,937
No... Flame-like.
That's a little nearer.

673
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,773
Flame-like then.
Something like a flame.

674
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,336
Once I'm sure I won

675
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,211
and what with that strike of
yours supposed I get out of it.

676
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,477
You're not paying attention.

677
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,712
It's no credit beating anyone
who does not pay attention.

678
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:04,821
Why, I tried to, Father.

679
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,355
Then you're just plain stupid.

680
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,684
Oh. Leave him alone.

681
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,816
No, sir. That boy has got to
learn to concentrate.

682
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,054
He'll never get anywhere
if he doesn't concentrate.

683
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,858
Did you ever hear
the fundamental law of physics,

684
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,627
known oddly enough as Curie's Law

685
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,462
Sheer luck.

686
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,264
I don't know how Pierre
ever stumbled on to it.

687
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,395
Oh, do be quiet, Eugene.

688
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,031
Croquet always makes me thirsty.

689
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,074
Want to drink?

690
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,837
Thank you, Father.

691
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,915
Yes,
that croquet always makes me thirsty.

692
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,415
Yes, it stirs up the thirst
in a man.

693
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,019
Nothing like a good drink
of lemonade

694
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,212
after a fast game of croquet

695
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,017
don't you think so, Pierre.

696
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,528
There.
I think you'll be comfortable here.

697
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,994
I'm sure I will.

698
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,962
This is Jacques' room
when he was home

699
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,968
Pierre's brother, you know.
Oh, there he is.

700
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,128
Where.

701
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,762
Oh, that. That's Pierre.

702
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,567
Oh, no. Really?

703
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,733
The other two are doctors
of course.

704
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:00,969
Crazy looking group.

705
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,670
I think it's charming.

706
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,281
Well. I hope you rest well.

707
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:09,113
Thank you. And thank you for
the lovely day.

708
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,481
I'd been very happy and...

709
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,282
You're very welcome, my dear.

710
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,823
If you care to
postpone your travel to Poland

711
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,120
we'd love to have you
stay with us for time.

712
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,489
It is very kind of you.

713
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,857
I like very much to stay

714
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,294
but I've already
written to my father

715
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,399
and he'd be expecting me.

716
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,000
It's no use, Mother, to talk
Mdme. Scholoscka

717
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,397
of staying on in Paris

718
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,868
It seems that she's determined to
return to Poland,

719
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,700
and apparently as far as
she is concerned

720
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,637
science is to be forgotten.

721
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:42,343
I did try to explain to you
why I have to return to Poland.

722
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,182
I thought you've understood.

723
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,723
I do understand and I'm sorry.

724
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,495
Well, good night, my dear.

725
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:56,395
Good night, Madame Curie.

726
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,866
Good night, Mademoiselle.

727
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:07,338
Pierre, you shouldn't
have spoken to her like that.

728
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,639
She's a very obstinate girl
Mother.

729
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,611
After all, Poland is her home.

730
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,046
What's that?

731
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,516
I'm just saying to Mother
she is a very obstinate girl.

732
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,551
Hmm, stubborn.

733
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,915
Exactly. That's what I mean.

734
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,079
Stubborn as they come.

735
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,123
Saw that the first minute
I clap her eyes on her.

736
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:22,225
Won't listen to reason.

737
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,191
Closes her mind like a clam.

738
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,159
Well, let's go to bed.

739
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:28,596
Good night, Mother.

740
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,132
Good night, son.

741
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,165
Good night, Father.

742
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,327
Good night, Pierre.

743
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,668
She's so intelligent about
other things

744
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,035
Good night.

745
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,147
Blind as a bat.

746
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,806
Who? Your son.

747
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:08,729
Mdme. Scholoscka...

748
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,167
What is it? What's happened?
Is anything wrong?

749
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,498
Dr. Curie.

750
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,738
I find it impossible for you to
leave Paris.

751
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:21,401
But what?

752
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,308
Please. I must talk to you.

753
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,677
I found myself in
a very peculiar position.

754
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,283
During these past two weeks

755
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,476
when you haven't
been to the laboratory

756
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,916
I found everything very confusing

757
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,453
It's impossible to do my work.

758
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,080
In short, I find it impossible to
go on without you.

759
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,021
But now, suddenly...

760
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,354
something has become
very clear to me.

761
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,554
I am helpful to you
in the laboratory, am I not?

762
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,664
Am I not? Didn't you say that?

763
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,662
Yes, of course.

764
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,460
A few times, I've been able to
give you suggestions

765
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,625
which you've found valuable

766
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,666
Of course.

767
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,963
Well, then, now.

768
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,265
Where as I was inclined to
be nervous and impatient

769
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,430
you were quite the opposite.

770
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,666
You have a clear mind
you were tenacious

771
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,639
you would never give up.

772
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,175
It's an excellent combination.

773
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,802
I might compare it with
the chemical formula NACI

774
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:57,914
Sodium Chloride.

775
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,515
It's a stable necessary compound.

776
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,140
So if we marry on this basis

777
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:02,684
our marriage would always
be the same.

778
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,082
The temperature would be the same

779
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,381
the composition would be the same

780
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,354
There would be no destruction
no fluctuation

781
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,119
none of the
uncertainties and emotions of love.

782
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,353
But...

783
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,019
I know how you feel about love
about men

784
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,892
I mean
and I respect that feeling.

785
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,590
It's also my own conviction.

786
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,793
For the scientist
there is no time for love.

787
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,871
I always believe science and
marriage to be incompatible

788
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,167
but it's stupid to believe
in generalization.

789
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,833
In our case, it would be a
wonderful collaboration.

790
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,970
A wonderful collaboration.
Don't you feel that?

791
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,047
I feel that.

792
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,740
And as for your father
from what you've said

793
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,149
I'm sure he would applaud
such a collaboration.

794
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,016
He might.

795
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,713
And as for Poland
what little good

796
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,653
you could make there,

797
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,557
you could make up here ten fold
on your own ground science.

798
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,724
What do you think I should do?

799
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:58,537
It would be a very fine thing
I believe

800
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,405
to pass our lives together

801
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,535
with our common scientific dream

802
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,013
to work together constantly
in our search

803
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,879
and any discovery that
we should make

804
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:10,885
no matter how small
would deepen the friendship

805
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,750
that we already have
for each other

806
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,053
and increase the respect that
we mutually feel.

807
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,592
I can imagine no respect

808
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:22,324
or friendship
greater than I have for you now.

809
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,765
I can imagine no future
so full of promise

810
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,737
than the one you offer.

811
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:35,675
Then I suggest that you stay
on in Paris with me.

812
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,307
I think you are right.

813
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,783
I should like to stay
in Paris very much.

814
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,356
Thank you.

815
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,302
We are engaged.

816
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,065
Engaged?

817
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,515
I'm sorry.

818
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,499
Oh, Pierre.
I'm so happy.

819
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,165
Oh. So very happy.

820
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,038
And I'm, too, my boy.
Very happy

821
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,042
Thank you, Mother.
Thank you, Father.

822
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,079
Oh, Pierre. I am so glad.

823
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,341
Good night, Mother.
Good night, father.

824
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:48,314
Good night, my boy.
Good night. Good night.

825
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,044
Good night.

826
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,594
Quiet, please...

827
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,364
Chaplain. Quiet, please.

828
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,598
Now, look right here, please

829
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:14,837
and hold absolutely still until
I count to ten.

830
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,570
Still.

831
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:24,746
One and two and three
and four and five

832
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:34,354
and six and seven and eight
and nine and ten.

833
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,258
How I wish you happiness
Mme. Curie.

834
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,165
Oh, David. Thank you.

835
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,704
You're the first one
who's called me that.

836
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,603
Good bye, Mme. Curie
and bon voyage.

837
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,606
Thank you, mademoiselle.

838
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,210
Good bye, my dear Marie.

839
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,608
Oh, Father dear. Good bye.

840
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,044
Oh, congratulations, lad.

841
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,478
Thank you. Thank you.

842
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:53,583
Congratulations.

843
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,686
Thank you, David. Bye. Bye.

844
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,117
Excuse me.

845
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,387
Now, where can I put
this chicken?

846
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,687
Mother
we don't need anymore food.

847
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:05,795
We're not going at the jungle.

848
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,920
Good gracious
what's this, Pierre?

849
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,124
What do you want the science book
on your honeymoon?

850
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:10,995
We want to read them, Mother.

851
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,602
Well, this is the last straw.

852
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,760
Mother, we want those books.

853
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,429
The chicken will do you fine
I assure you.

854
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,097
Science books on your honeymoon!

855
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,800
My boy, good bye.

856
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,808
Good bye.

857
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,608
Ready, Marie? Here they go...

858
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,227
You're very lovely, Marie.

859
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,423
Thank you, Pierre.

860
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,586
Music is lovely, isn't it?

861
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,457
Yes. Thank you.

862
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:25,896
Pierre.

863
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:26,866
Yes.

864
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,369
Would you hate to get back?

865
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:32,202
In a way, although I have a lot
of work that I must do.

866
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,839
What should I work on, Pierre?

867
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,882
What subject should I choose for
my doctors degree?

868
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,509
Is there anything that
particularly interests you?

869
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:48,284
Oh, yes. Yes, a number of things
but...

870
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,595
What is it? Why did you stop?

871
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,857
Oh, nothing.

872
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,763
It's just an idea that
went through my mind.

873
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,166
Well, what was it?

874
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,741
Do you remember that
Professor Becquerel showed us that rock

875
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,435
The pitch blende and the plate he
exposed to it?

876
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:08,703
Yes.

877
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,244
You know, Pierre.

878
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,076
I can't get that out of my mind.

879
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,615
Really? Why?

880
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,981
I know it's true
that the rays give...

881
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,418
not by something
in the pitch blende

882
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:23,014
I can't get over the feeling
that there's more to it than that

883
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,390
that there's something else

884
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,965
something beyond
Becquerel's explanation.

885
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:33,229
I don't quite understand.

886
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,838
Well, what are these rays
that given off

887
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,838
and why are they being given off.

888
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,602
It's an accepted principle
in science

889
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,040
that nothing can go on forever

890
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,373
without running dull, isn't it?
Yes.

891
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,743
I mean, the clock will run dull
if it isn't wound.

892
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,248
Afire would burn out if it's not
replenished.

893
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,876
Life will die if it is inflate.

894
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,886
Yet in these rocks
which are embedded

895
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,958
in the middle of the earth
millions of years

896
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,391
never seen the sun

897
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:04,592
Rays are constantly given off
more all by themselves.

898
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:10,298
What is this energy?
Where does it come from?

899
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,808
I supposed
I'm being very foolish.

900
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,471
Some of the greatest achievements
in science

901
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,379
come to the same type
of foolishness.

902
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,179
When an explanation is given
of something

903
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,220
and every one believes it

904
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,724
there may be one person somewhere
who can't quite accept it,

905
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,125
who instinctively says
I'm not sure that

906
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,322
this is sufficient explanation.

907
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,559
Maybe something beyond this.

908
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,194
It's that
kind of foolishness, Marie.

909
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,336
Well, I'm not that person
I'm sure.

910
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,241
How do you know? Perhaps you are

911
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,213
Perhaps Dr. Becquerel has only
set the gate a jar.

912
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,377
Maybe a long
and unexplored road ahead

913
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,319
I wouldn't even know how to start
Pierre.

914
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,897
I wouldn't know what to do.

915
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,733
I'm very glad we're married
to each other, Pierre.

916
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,501
Darling.

917
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:46,926
Hello, Marie.

918
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,334
My class kept me the day
with the most stupid questions.

919
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,440
Thought I would never get away.

920
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,235
Just tonight
when we're having guests.

921
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,413
I have a terrible problem.

922
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:04,383
I hope I got the things
you wanted me to get.

923
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,352
I lost the slip that
I made the notes on

924
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,354
and I couldn't remember

925
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,016
whether there was turnips
or carrots, so I got both.

926
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,560
Mother likes carrots
and Father likes turnips.

927
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,926
And here's some flowers
for the cook.

928
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,669
Thank you, Pierre.

929
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,102
What's the matter, Marie?

930
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,231
Oh, Pierre. I'm so discouraged.

931
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,707
Looks like this method of mine
is all wrong.

932
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,836
I wonder if I'm trying something
beyond me.

933
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,915
What is it exactly that's wrong?

934
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,210
I don't know.

935
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,411
My measurements.
they don't mean anything.

936
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,044
I know I must be making mistakes
some where...

937
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,850
but I don't know where it is.

938
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:45,519
I checked them and
I rechecked them two hundred times.

939
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,994
Maybe the electrometer
is not working right.

940
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,157
That's what I'm afraid of.

941
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,997
I wish you'd examine it for me
Pierre

942
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:59,006
I'll go over it tomorrow.
Let's forget it tonight.

943
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,942
Let's not talk, not even
think the laboratory

944
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,876
Promise?

945
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,243
I promise.

946
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,335
Well, Pierre. What is it?

947
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,743
Marie, about those measurements.

948
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,107
Do you think
anything could have happened

949
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,442
to change the capacity
of the electrometer?

950
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,211
Weren't we suppose to forget
the laboratory tonight?

951
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,751
Oh. I forgot. I'm sorry.

952
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,481
No more... I’m terribly sorry.

953
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
Here they are.

954
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,281
Where's my coat?

955
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,489
Here we are.

956
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,860
Hello, dear. Pierre.

957
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,365
Mother.

958
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,695
I smell turnips.

959
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,098
We got carrots for you.

960
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,364
Oh, how sweet of you.

961
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,996
Oh, I brought you
some of my new plum jelly.

962
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:05,971
Thank you, Mother.

963
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,235
She made it but I brought it.

964
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,277
Ah, thank you, Father.

965
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,310
Let me have your things.

966
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,641
Your coat, Father?

967
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,612
Yeah. You're not
treating her right, Pierre.

968
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,217
She looks pinkish.

969
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,786
Oh, it's silly.
Why you look lovely, dear.

970
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,388
Just the same, she's too thin.

971
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,623
And I say a woman without a child
is a parasite.

972
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,749
She feeds on life

973
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,953
but is not willing to
give life in return.

974
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,997
What is being her excuse
to have life.

975
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:30,599
Why would she ever born?

976
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:31,701
She's a blood sucker.

977
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,166
Now, don't call names, George.

978
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,201
Are you listening to me?

979
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,099
Of course.

980
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,637
A woman without a child
is a blood sucker.

981
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,762
We didn't mean you, my dear.

982
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,534
Oh, yes.
She's just the one I did mean.

983
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:41,576
But I'm going to have a child.

984
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,405
When?

985
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,773
Soon, I hope.

986
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,210
Oh, my dear. Marie.

987
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,542
Yes, dear.

988
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,583
Look who's going to say something
at last.

989
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,152
Are you sure the insulation is dry?

990
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,084
Yes, Pierre.

991
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,689
He's getting quite chatty lately
isn't he?

992
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,723
Don't bother them.
They're thinking of something.

993
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:56,757
I don't believe it.

994
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,360
Did you check
the ground connection?

995
00:54:58,495 --> 00:54:59,223
I don't know.

996
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,590
I thought you gave it to me
in good order.

997
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,721
Well, sometimes it work loose
and you don't notice it.

998
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,493
Pierre, that could be possible
couldn't it?

999
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,398
Yes. Yes, of course.

1000
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,505
The thing we must do is to check
that line completely

1001
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,799
from one end to the other.

1002
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,999
In that case
my measurements may be correct.

1003
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,167
Yes.

1004
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,005
Then all these months of work

1005
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,407
couldn't have been wrong
after all.

1006
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,638
That's right.

1007
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,877
Pierre, that's it.
That must be it...

1008
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,485
Yes, that must be it.

1009
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,611
Alright. Alright.
Go ahead and check it.

1010
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,313
Father, it's just that, well

1011
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,084
Marie has so many setbacks
with her work.

1012
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,556
That's alright.
Don't stop doing...

1013
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,025
Please. Go ahead.

1014
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,062
It's just that I've been
waiting for so many months.

1015
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:35,186
It's alright, my dear.

1016
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,061
I hope you won't mind
if I stay long enough

1017
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,326
to finish my coffee.

1018
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,527
Please do and we'll try to
get back before you go.

1019
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,898
Thank you, my boy. Thank you.

1020
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,005
Good bye.

1021
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,472
You know, sometimes that son of
yours is not quite all right.

1022
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,008
Nice having dinner with you.

1023
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:52,012
You know, I'll never
come to this house

1024
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:54,378
but for the sake...
It's Alright, George.

1025
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,952
It happens every time.

1026
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,727
Well?

1027
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,100
It's alright.
Nothing wrong with it.

1028
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,536
I was wrong.

1029
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,599
I was sure we've found it.

1030
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,143
Well...

1031
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:29,581
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1032
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,812
You tested all of the elements.
you're sure of that, Marie?

1033
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,422
Yes, I'm positive, Pierre.

1034
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,217
And you found that
only two of them...

1035
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,552
uranium and thorium
gave off rays.

1036
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,523
That's right.

1037
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,957
Then
you measured the uranium and thorium

1038
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:40,062
in the pitch blende ore.

1039
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,663
And that's when I run
into trouble.

1040
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:44,392
The pitch blende has more
radioactivity than I can explained

1041
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,026
by the amount of
uranium and thorium had in it.

1042
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:49,833
Would you like to show me

1043
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,032
how you make your measurements
Marie?

1044
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,005
You wouldn't mind?

1045
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:54,405
Of course not.

1046
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:55,067
Alright.

1047
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,415
Here is what I've done
so many times that I lost count.

1048
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,721
Here is crude pitch blende.

1049
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,652
Now we know that
the rays came from the uranium

1050
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,622
and thorium that are
in this pitch blende.

1051
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,249
Those two elements
give off the rays.

1052
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,190
Correct.

1053
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:13,454
I put the pitch blende
in this mortar.

1054
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,460
Has the mortar always been clean?

1055
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,258
Always and grinded up.

1056
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,923
Here is the ground pitch blende

1057
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,898
throw in the uranium
and thorium in it

1058
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,936
I also fill a disk level full.

1059
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:23,402
Just like what I've done
every time.

1060
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,508
Then I placed it
in the electrometer.

1061
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,877
And I close the case
so there is no draft.

1062
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,073
Good.

1063
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,047
I charged the electrometer.

1064
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,182
Now I will find out
how much energy to raise

1065
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:44,418
in the pitch blende they have
is it right?

1066
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,789
Right. Start.

1067
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,955
Ready. Read.

1068
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,612
Eight.

1069
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:04,474
Eight.

1070
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,138
Same reading as I always had.

1071
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,682
This pitch blende
with the uranium and the thorium

1072
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,343
still in it comes to eight.

1073
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,422
Now, here is pure uranium

1074
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,990
I strike it
in the same amount of pitch blende.

1075
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,958
This is exactly the same case
close the case

1076
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,960
charged the electrometer

1077
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:21,620
Now, we will find out

1078
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,664
how much energy
the rays in the uranium have.

1079
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,097
Right.

1080
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,368
Ready. Read.

1081
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,945
Two, same as always.
Done nothing wrong so far.

1082
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,142
Not that I can see.

1083
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:44,082
We know then that...

1084
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,949
the pitch blende with
the uranium and thorium in it

1085
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:49,820
comes to eight and that
the uranium alone reads two.

1086
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,187
I am going to test the thorium.

1087
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,419
From the same amount of pitch blende?

1088
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:54,462
Of course, and put in exactly
the same case

1089
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,122
close the case
charged the electrometer.

1090
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,827
Now we find out how much energy
the rays in thorium have?

1091
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:01,131
Right.

1092
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,704
Ready. Read.

1093
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,506
Two

1094
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:20,254
I don't understand.
There must be a mistake.

1095
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,754
When the uranium and thoarum are
in the pitch blende

1096
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,793
the reading is eight.

1097
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:29,695
But individually
they only total four.

1098
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,129
Have you checked
all the other elements

1099
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,234
in the pitch blende?

1100
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:35,531
I checked every elements.
There is no the result.

1101
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:37,936
Every elements in existence.

1102
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,840
Uranium and thorium are
the only elements that give off rays.

1103
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,411
Why do they give off twice

1104
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,979
as much when they are
in the pitch blende as they do

1105
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,446
as they were tested separately?

1106
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,417
Where are those
four missing points?

1107
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,714
That is what I don't understand.

1108
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,085
I don't understand.

1109
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,555
You make the chemical analysis of

1110
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,422
what is content
in the pitch blende, didn't you?

1111
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,687
Of course. Could I see it?

1112
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:00,955
Yes.

1113
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,793
Uranium oxide - 75%

1114
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,599
Chlorium Oxide - 13%
Lead sulfide - 3%

1115
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,470
Silicon dioxide - 2%
Calcium oxide - 3%

1116
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,272
Barium oxide - 2%
Iron oxide - 1%

1117
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,812
Magnesium oxide - 1/990%

1118
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:22,907
other extraneous elements
1/1000%

1119
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,601
Pierre Yes?

1120
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,543
Our universe is composed of
definitely known substances

1121
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,943
isn't it?

1122
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:59,112
Elements are fixed forever
in earth unchanging

1123
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,189
we know that, don't we?

1124
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,656
All of our scientist
based on that

1125
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,591
All of our science is
based on that. Go on

1126
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,655
In the beginning

1127
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,632
man used to think that the world
have only of four elements,

1128
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,930
earth, air, fire and water.

1129
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,868
They thought that everything
in their universe

1130
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,167
could be made out of those.
Yes. Go on.

1131
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,105
But They were wrong, weren't they?

1132
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,575
They were wrong.

1133
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:26,512
Now we know that
there are 78 elements

1134
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:30,044
The elements over there
on the shelves

1135
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,020
and we believe that there are
some elements still unknown

1136
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,385
but we assume that...

1137
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:39,791
these missing elements
have the same character

1138
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:41,590
as those we know already.

1139
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,130
That is right

1140
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,325
Pierre

1141
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,502
What if there is
a kind of matter in the world

1142
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,835
we never even dream of?

1143
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,909
What would that mean?

1144
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,274
Marie, that would mean

1145
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:03,409
that our whole conception of the
nature of matter would

1146
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,885
have to be changed.

1147
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,886
It is cold in here.

1148
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,858
Tell me what you are thinking.

1149
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:22,998
I don't quite dare.

1150
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:26,040
Go on and say it now matter
how crazy it sounds.

1151
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:32,238
What if we did not make a mistake
in our measurement?

1152
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:38,377
What if the conception
of science is wrong?

1153
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,886
What if there exists a matter

1154
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:45,585
that is not in earth
but alive, dynamic?

1155
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:05,704
Do we dare think that our
four missing points

1156
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:15,052
these strange power
is of 1/1000%?

1157
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,226
Pierre.

1158
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,163
We have discovered a new element.

1159
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,532
An active element.

1160
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,334
The residue for pitch blende.
What was left over

1161
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,206
After I extract
the uranium and the thoarum

1162
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:37,573
it must be in there.

1163
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,304
Where it is?

1164
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,243
In the resin...

1165
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,009
Close the curtains.

1166
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,422
Ready?

1167
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:57,658
Marie, if your four missing
points are here

1168
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:03,102
our notion of the universe
will be changed.

1169
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,934
Ready? Read.

1170
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,357
Four.

1171
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,160
Oh, Pierre.

1172
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,666
Marie. This new concept.

1173
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:45,747
If we can prove the existence
of this new element

1174
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,079
it may enable us to look into
the secret of life itself

1175
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,483
deeper than ever before in the
history of the world.

1176
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,825
Madame Curie, you must realize

1177
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,929
that the board
has given you repetition

1178
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,463
every consideration. However...

1179
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,590
the university has not an
extensive budget

1180
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,794
for the creation of
new laboratories

1181
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,872
and for the new equipment
you ask for.

1182
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,235
You state that...

1183
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,640
you and Dr. Curie had detected
the presence of a new element

1184
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,473
an active element.

1185
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,877
But unfortunately
you have given us

1186
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,416
no convincing proof
of its existence.

1187
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,577
We have demonstrated of
its existence experimentally.

1188
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,189
We have carried on our
research intensely

1189
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,952
except for five weeks
in the autumn.

1190
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,425
In September
my daughter was born

1191
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,189
and a week later

1192
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,027
my husband has the misfortune to
lose his mother.

1193
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:42,004
But the rest of the time, we have
devoted entirely to research.

1194
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,105
And yet in this eight
or nine months

1195
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,696
you have came no closer

1196
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:47,709
to any proof
as to the existence of ah...

1197
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,333
what is the name of it?

1198
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,345
Ah, my wife has named it radium.

1199
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:53,914
Oh yes, radium

1200
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,644
I should like to ask
Dr. Curie a question.

1201
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,912
Yes, Professor Roger

1202
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:58,918
This work.

1203
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,750
Will it require
quite a little time

1204
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,222
will it not? Yes, of course.

1205
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,259
But you are already
teaching at school

1206
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,225
of physics and chemistry.

1207
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:11,629
And Madam Curie is teaching at
the normal school at Sebra.

1208
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:13,598
It would be
a formidable undertaking

1209
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,203
under the best of circumstances.

1210
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:19,468
Under these conditions
hardly seems promising.

1211
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:24,341
And Madam Curie, in spite of
her acknowledged abilities is

1212
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,416
if you would permit me
to say so young

1213
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:32,282
inexperienced, and a woman.

1214
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,015
Gentleman. If you please.

1215
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,819
This remark seems to me
entirely irrelevant.

1216
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,451
It is perfectly true
that Madame Curie is young

1217
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,086
that she has not
had the experience

1218
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,323
that most of us have had

1219
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,297
and as you say she is a woman.

1220
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:47,095
But let me impress upon you
gentlemen

1221
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,295
that she is of most unusual woman

1222
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,601
I might say her, ah
a most unusual woman.

1223
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,336
You can't classify her
with that term

1224
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:56,706
I have had the opportunity of

1225
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,076
observing Madam Curie
very closely

1226
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,705
and I can assure you, gentlemen

1227
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,943
that she is remarkable scientist

1228
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,882
as scrupulous as she is brilliant

1229
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,181
and furthermore...

1230
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,557
Of course, gentlemen

1231
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,094
you understand
that I am looking upon

1232
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,528
Madame Curie
with complete coolness

1233
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,496
and complete detachment

1234
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:21,364
as I would in judging
any other colleague.

1235
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,335
We understand that
you are convinced

1236
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:26,737
as to the reliability of
Madame curie's investigation.

1237
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,208
Entirely, I have even put aside
my own research

1238
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,472
to devote my entire time

1239
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,706
to collaborating with her

1240
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:35,180
in the isolation of
this new element.

1241
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,409
Dr. Curie

1242
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:42,650
much as we would like to
help you and Madame Curie

1243
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:46,023
our budget does not provide the
purposes of this kind.

1244
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:50,690
However, the suggestion was made
by Professor Roger

1245
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:54,496
in which we have unanimously
concurred to offer you the use

1246
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:59,336
of the shade across the courtyard
from the school of physics.

1247
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:00,669
We are aware that this shade

1248
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,278
is not the most suitable place for
your investigation.

1249
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:05,744
Gentlemen
am I to understand that

1250
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,248
you are offering us the old shade
across from the physics building?

1251
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,285
The one, that was used as a
dissecting room

1252
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,685
by medical students?
If this abominable shade is available,

1253
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:18,260
it's only because no one can be
found who is willing to work in it.

1254
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,488
The roof leaks. It has no floor
but the wet ground.

1255
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,029
It can't be heated.

1256
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,326
In summer, it is stifling
as a hot house

1257
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,992
and in winter, it freezes.

1258
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,296
And do you imagine that

1259
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,372
I would permit my wife to work
under these appalling conditions?

1260
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,998
If you do
gentlemen, believe me...

1261
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,611
With my husband's permission

1262
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:47,188
we should be very glad
to accept the shade.

1263
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,061
We shall be very grateful
to have the shade.

1264
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,618
This was the shade
across the courtyard

1265
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,556
from the school of physics.

1266
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:30,097
This was to be the laboratory
of Marie and Pierre Curie

1267
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,099
The place was even worse than
they had expected.

1268
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,759
There was no equipment.

1269
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:38,704
They were at the mercy of
the worse extremes of the weather.

1270
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,607
How could they do anything
worthwhile under such conditions?

1271
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,235
If they'd know at the start

1272
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,245
how long they will have
to work here and

1273
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:50,341
what difficulties awaited them
would they have dare to begin?

1274
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,920
Well, yes, they probably would.

1275
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,454
They were that kind of people.

1276
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,751
At first
it was sheer physical labor

1277
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,293
beyond the strength
of either of them.

1278
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,555
During those winter days

1279
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,494
they carried on between them

1280
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:06,396
the work of
the entire chemical plant.

1281
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,435
The raw material was pitch blende

1282
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,233
from the mines of
Bohemia tons of it

1283
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,638
from which they plan to
extract all the known elements

1284
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:17,610
until only a few ounces remain.

1285
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,976
From this few ounces, radium

1286
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:24,279
their precious element
was eventually to be isolated.

1287
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,321
In the beginning
in spite of the bitter cold

1288
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:29,720
the work had to be done
out of doors

1289
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,190
because of the fire and fumes.

1290
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,956
The first step was to
melt the crude ore

1291
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,689
on a large oblong tank

1292
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,993
till it was boiling like lava.

1293
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,295
Then acid was poured in.

1294
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,997
This was to
dissolve out the salts.

1295
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,974
When this was done
the next stage was to melt down

1296
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,345
the residue in separate cordon

1297
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,783
another back breaking job
for the fire must not go out.

1298
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,047
Night or day

1299
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:04,421
either Pierre or Marie
had to be on hand all the time.

1300
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,528
Dogged determination
kept them going

1301
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:10,758
through month after month of
such arduous dangerous work

1302
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,766
but even so
it began at last to tear on

1303
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,961
both Pierre and Marie.

1304
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,305
This was something they had to
fight continually

1305
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,815
the gas fumes.

1306
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,057
Eventually, months run into years

1307
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,091
The kind of works changed

1308
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,785
but Pierre had to build

1309
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,988
or assemble their equipment
and with any material

1310
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,895
that lay at hand.

1311
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,264
What was left of
the original pitch blende

1312
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:48,961
had now to be filtered and

1313
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,834
re-filtered to
remove other elements.

1314
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:55,102
And this work were not
quite so physically strenuous

1315
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:56,506
was hard enough

1316
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,842
specially during
the hot summer days.

1317
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,151
And so the work went on
until presently

1318
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,753
everything had been removed

1319
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:09,289
from the tons of ore
except two final elements

1320
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,416
one was barium and the other

1321
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,152
which they had began to
think of it

1322
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,126
in their heart
as their own element

1323
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,324
was the precious illusive radium.

1324
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,025
Pierre and Marie thought that

1325
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,332
the end of their task
must surely be in sight.

1326
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:28,000
All that was now left was to
separate these two survivors

1327
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,475
barium and radium.

1328
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,410
This was the problem to
separate barium

1329
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,074
and radium somehow or other.

1330
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:07,577
No separation.

1331
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:15,984
No separation. No separation.

1332
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,660
September the 12th 1899.

1333
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,961
Reduction of pitch blende
nearly finish.

1334
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,831
Only barium and radium remain.

1335
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:33,305
The next separation
will give radium.

1336
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,103
November the 8th, 1899.

1337
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:38,441
First experiment. No separation.

1338
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,309
November the 10th, 1899.

1339
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,680
Second experiment. No separation.

1340
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,151
July the 16th, 1900.

1341
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,654
Four hundred
and fifty eight experiments.

1342
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:52,386
Radium still refuses to separated
from barium.

1343
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,726
Alright, then, radium wouldn't be
separated from barium.

1344
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:59,197
We've done all we can

1345
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,598
and more more than
most people would have done

1346
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,831
thanks to your tenacity
but it's useless.

1347
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,100
We'll never find a way
of separating.

1348
01:14:07,242 --> 01:14:11,042
Barium and radium
can not be separated.

1349
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,175
How much longer do you think

1350
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:15,783
we can stand this
insufferable heat

1351
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:18,352
stifling in summer
and freezing in winter.

1352
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,613
How much longer do you think

1353
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,655
you can drive yourself like this?

1354
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,758
And how much longer do you think
I can stand by

1355
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,655
and watch you destroy yourself?

1356
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,591
The world has done without
radium up to now.

1357
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,196
What does it matter
if it is isolated

1358
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,322
for another 100 years.

1359
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,071
I can't give it up.

1360
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:44,703
If it takes a hundred years
it would be a pity

1361
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:48,943
but I am going to see how far
I could go, even my lifetime

1362
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:22,647
We have never seen burns
quite like this before

1363
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:24,945
they are very strange.

1364
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,948
I can't ever remember
seeing anything quite like them

1365
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:33,960
they obviously don't come from
any normal substance.

1366
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,630
Madame Curie
how long have been making

1367
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:42,931
your experiments with
this unknown element?

1368
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:47,804
For the past three
three and a half years.

1369
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:51,310
And have these burns
given you much pain?

1370
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:56,213
No. They are irritating at times

1371
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:59,787
but I never pay attention to them
until lately.

1372
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,459
I see.

1373
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,292
It is obvious that
you are dealing with

1374
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:11,763
some remarkable powerful force.

1375
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,959
As to what these burns
are exactly

1376
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:17,003
there is no means of telling.

1377
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:19,801
I don't wish to alarm you
Madame Curie

1378
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,273
but it is possible that

1379
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,810
these burns might become serious

1380
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,107
might in fact develop malignantly

1381
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,478
if you continue to expose them
excessively

1382
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,381
to your unknown element.

1383
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,182
It is not impossible

1384
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:37,417
they may be developed
into a cancerous nature.

1385
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:47,130
It is my advice, Madame
that you abandon your experiments.

1386
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,339
Cancer.

1387
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,002
No, Pierre.

1388
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:02,480
He only said the burns
might develop malignantly

1389
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,483
Like develop into cancer.

1390
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,853
No. He said they might possibly
develop into a cancerous nature

1391
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,984
but only if it excessively
exposed to our radium.

1392
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,561
So if we're careful

1393
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,664
there is nothing
to be frightened about.

1394
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,698
But the very word frightens me.

1395
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,928
You saw how it took my own mother.

1396
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:26,805
We'll have to give up
our experiments

1397
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:29,137
If we are dealing with
as powerful a forces

1398
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,575
there is no telling what...

1399
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:32,702
I wouldn't allow it.

1400
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:33,872
I wouldn't let you take such risk

1401
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,675
I won't permit you.

1402
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,044
No, Marie. Pierre, please.
Listen to me, please.

1403
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,277
There is something
I must tell you

1404
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,015
and then you should decide
as you wish.

1405
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,524
Very well, Marie.

1406
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:52,132
As I left the doctor
I have been thinking.

1407
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,964
This element of ours obviously
has a terrific power.

1408
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:59,437
Power enough to
affect healthy tissue like mine.

1409
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:02,168
Power enough to destroy tissue.

1410
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,177
Pierre, if it has this power

1411
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:09,875
why hasn't it also the power to
destroy unhealthy tissue?

1412
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,344
You realize what that might mean?

1413
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,251
It could heal.

1414
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,255
By destroying unhealthy tissue

1415
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:21,192
it could heal all men of diseases

1416
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,524
Like cancer? You?

1417
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,929
Yes, Pierre.
It might even do that.

1418
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:30,004
We don't know what things
it might do for people.

1419
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,540
But, Marie... Oh, Pierre.
Can't you see

1420
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:38,043
how unimportant little things
like these are compared

1421
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,909
to what it might mean?

1422
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:45,850
It might prevent great sicknesses
even deaths. Pierre.

1423
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,147
And so they went on
with their work

1424
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,807
using every possible precaution.

1425
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,147
Marie's fingers healed.

1426
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,249
And though
they did not find a way

1427
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:24,984
to separate radium and barium
in a single process

1428
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,823
they did discover a method of
removing barium

1429
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,330
little by little in
infinite decimal amounts.

1430
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,763
Working on the theory

1431
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,461
that once the whole of the barium
is removed

1432
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,266
nothing could be left but radium.

1433
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,844
Here we see the sort of
things they had to do.

1434
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,549
This is called crystallization.

1435
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:59,888
When the liquid evaporates
crystals are left.

1436
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:04,431
This was the thing they had to
do over and over again.

1437
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,778
It proved to be the most exacting

1438
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,821
of all of the stages
of their long test.

1439
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,890
For it continues for two years

1440
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:33,426
and require thousands of
separate operations.

1441
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,893
By now the residue

1442
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,124
from all the various processes
they had worked at lay

1443
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,429
in hundreds of
this small evaporating bowls.

1444
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:46,098
Small, because larger quantities
would not evaporate so quickly.

1445
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:49,506
Crystallizing
and re-crystallizing.

1446
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,135
Each operation
they hope bring them

1447
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,649
closer and closer to the heart of
the great mystery.

1448
01:20:57,752 --> 01:21:00,915
At last, they arrive
at the final crystallization

1449
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:05,220
the one that contains the concentrated
results of all the others.

1450
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:10,059
The last survivors out of
those hundreds of evaporating bowls.

1451
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:21,201
I think I feel like crying

1452
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,179
Professor Poirot.

1453
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:31,512
Professor Poirot.

1454
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:36,955
Madam Curie, but I am afraid
I have come at a crucial moment.

1455
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:39,253
No. No. We have finished.

1456
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,055
We have nothing to do now
but wait.

1457
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,322
I am delighted to see you.

1458
01:21:42,464 --> 01:21:43,863
There is nobody
we'd rather have waited

1459
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,330
at this moment than you.

1460
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,434
Thank you.

1461
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:50,095
And I have brought with me
an very illustrious visitor.

1462
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,230
No more illustrious than these
young folks will be.

1463
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:56,310
The name of Curie will lead
all the rest.

1464
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,880
Your taller, my boy, considerably
than I have imagine.

1465
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:05,214
And you, Madame, so young,
so beautiful and so brilliant

1466
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,685
I don't know which is
the greater miracle

1467
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:10,416
you or radium.

1468
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,549
Why don't you introduce me
Poirot?

1469
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:16,960
I think I know.
Isn't it Lord Kelvin?

1470
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,328
I absolutely refuse to
return to London

1471
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:20,764
without meeting you both.

1472
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,767
As long as
the greatest living scientist

1473
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:24,701
believe in
the existence of radium

1474
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:26,636
what the other thoughts
didn't seem to matter.

1475
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,472
Here are the evaporating dishes.

1476
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,773
How many crystallization
did you make

1477
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:34,472
hundreds I suppose?

1478
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,776
Tell him, Pierre.

1479
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,043
Look here, sir.

1480
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:45,616
Five thousands six hundred
and seventy-seven.

1481
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,254
And the last crystallization is
in there, I supposed.

1482
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:55,097
Five thousands six hundred
and seventy-seven.

1483
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,405
And thus crystallization.

1484
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:06,207
What a historic moment.

1485
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,652
That little bowl
represents eight tons

1486
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:16,189
of pitch blende
and four years of work.

1487
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,292
In a few hour
the water will be gone

1488
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,417
and only radium will remain.

1489
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,756
Pure radium.

1490
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,387
I am sort of tempted to
stay and see it

1491
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:25,829
but it's New Year's Eve and

1492
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:28,458
my family is expected me
in London.

1493
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,366
Mine is just as well.

1494
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:35,169
This great moment should
belong to the two of you alone.

1495
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:37,278
You begin the year, my friends

1496
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:40,404
that will mark your fame.
Goodbye.

1497
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,516
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Sir.

1498
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,140
C'mon along, Poirot.
My train won't wait.

1499
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,013
Goodnight, dear,

1500
01:23:45,153 --> 01:23:46,518
Goodbye.

1501
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,417
I shall come back to Paris
next week

1502
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,718
and see your radium
with my own eye.

1503
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,420
You can send me
a telegram tonight

1504
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,223
and describing it to me.

1505
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,799
We have a coin over there.

1506
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,630
We wrote something
out for this occasion

1507
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,831
Bring out the old
bring in the new

1508
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:09,705
bring out the false
bring in the true.

1509
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:11,869
Good bye. God blessed you.

1510
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,640
Good bye. Good bye.

1511
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,149
What a wonderful man.

1512
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:26,317
The really great men
are always simple and good.

1513
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,030
Yes.

1514
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,226
We're both very tired.

1515
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,100
Yes.

1516
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,208
Shall we try to get some rest?
Very well

1517
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,902
Sit here a while and
I cover you with this robe.

1518
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:48,240
There.

1519
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,476
Put that chair over.
I can't reach you

1520
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,812
Yeah. That's better.

1521
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,986
Let's try to doze off.

1522
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:30,281
Pierre.

1523
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:34,452
What time is it? I overslept.

1524
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:36,086
I must be tired.

1525
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:40,800
It is five.

1526
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,770
Must be crystallized by now.

1527
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,600
Must be there.

1528
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,504
Our radium must be there.

1529
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:55,247
C'mon.

1530
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,511
Do you mind? You look first.

1531
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,794
There's nothing there

1532
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:46,526
not a trace of anything
not a grain.

1533
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:49,398
Only a stain.

1534
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,334
What had happened Pierre?

1535
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,804
Where is our radium?
What have we done?

1536
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,876
Where is it? What's happened?

1537
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,477
Where is it, Pierre?

1538
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:59,011
I don't know.

1539
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,136
What did we do that was wrong?

1540
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:01,578
What could we have done?
We've done nothing wrong.

1541
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,411
I can't stand it, Pierre

1542
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:04,609
Where is our radium?

1543
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,242
We worked for
years and years and years

1544
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,719
It must be there.
It must be there.

1545
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:15,762
Four long years in this shed.
Four long years.

1546
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:32,576
Is that you?

1547
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:33,373
Yes, Father.

1548
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,744
Well, something's got to be don
about that child of yours.

1549
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:37,714
I think you ought to take it back.

1550
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:38,978
I let her stand on my head

1551
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,111
to let her eat her supper
and now she...

1552
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:45,522
now she, now she won't go to bed
until her mother tells her story.

1553
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,321
I like to know what's the matter
with my stories.

1554
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,259
They are the same stories.

1555
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,324
I'll go up to her.

1556
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:13,085
Then what happened, Mommy.

1557
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,952
I am sorry, Irene darling.

1558
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,788
Mother just can't tell you
anymore tonight.

1559
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:23,556
Oh, Mommy, please.

1560
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:27,924
What is the matter, Mommy?

1561
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:31,598
But, I wanted to know
what happen, Mommy

1562
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:34,071
If you close your eyes tight

1563
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,199
Daddy will tell you a story.

1564
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:38,244
What's it about?

1565
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:42,873
Well, ah, its about

1566
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:49,286
ah, it's about a strange
and wonderful treasure

1567
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,587
that was locked up
in an enchanted stone.

1568
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:54,957
Is there a princess in it?

1569
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,190
Yes, a princess.

1570
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:03,270
A beautiful princes
with golden hair.

1571
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,804
Is there a prince too?

1572
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:11,503
No, not a prince
but a man who live all alone

1573
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:13,910
until the princess found him.

1574
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:16,175
Did they love each other?

1575
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:19,252
Very much.

1576
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,823
Alright, Daddy
my eyes are closed

1577
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:31,056
Well, now, one day the princes
told the man

1578
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,599
about this wonderful treasure

1579
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:38,263
so they decided to go
and search of it together.

1580
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,897
Now, no one had ever seen
this treasure

1581
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:43,374
of course, but the princes knew

1582
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:44,842
that it was there.

1583
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:48,312
And she knew if they could get it
out of the stone,

1584
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:52,249
it might let people see
wonderful things

1585
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,483
that they had never
been able to see before.

1586
01:29:56,624 --> 01:30:02,585
So they worked very hard
for a long long time

1587
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,689
to try and rescue the treasure
from the stone.

1588
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:10,429
And they grew very tired

1589
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,096
And at last, they knew that...

1590
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:16,733
they would never be able to
free the treasure

1591
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:22,680
from the enchant of the stone
but they weren't sad about it

1592
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:25,547
because they knew that

1593
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:29,213
no matter how many disappointment
they had

1594
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:32,724
they would always go on together.

1595
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:35,590
Having the courage
to take many disappointments

1596
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,393
because they were together

1597
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:43,300
and they live happily ever after.

1598
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,209
She is asleep.

1599
01:30:57,518 --> 01:31:00,783
You know, we promised David that...

1600
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:05,020
But I supposed you naturally
don't feel like...

1601
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,658
Oh, I remember.
The New Year's Party.

1602
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:12,630
But, of course
you don't feel like going.

1603
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:15,201
Pierre, we promised.

1604
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:21,172
Let's go.
I'd rather. Might help.

1605
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,243
Good. Good then.

1606
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:38,023
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

1607
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,649
Happy New Year.

1608
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,470
Happy New Year, Marie.

1609
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,369
Happy New Year, Pierre.

1610
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,679
Try to put it out of your mind
Marie

1611
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:42,754
and go to sleep

1612
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,451
I can't.
I can't accept it, Pierre.

1613
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:48,221
But, Marie, sometimes
there are things

1614
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:49,920
you just must accept it

1615
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,258
If I only knew why we fail.

1616
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,264
I think that the failure itself
I wouldn't mind

1617
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:56,666
so much about it
but the reason for it.

1618
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,863
Months and months and months ago

1619
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:01,702
you did find
the right process to use.

1620
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:05,278
At the very end
why should it suddenly fail?

1621
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:09,144
I don't know. I don't know.

1622
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:14,414
Pierre, that stain on the saucer.

1623
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:15,749
Yes.

1624
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,790
We didn't even test it, did we?

1625
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:20,018
No, we didn't.

1626
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,287
What we are expecting to find

1627
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:24,262
was a definite amount of radium
wasn't it?

1628
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:27,162
Something we could see and feel.

1629
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:30,270
Not as much as a pinch of salt
you said

1630
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,962
Yes.

1631
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:40,343
Pierre, what if it's...
a merely a question of amount?

1632
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:43,146
What does so little radium
in proportion

1633
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,911
to the amount of material
that we use

1634
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:49,113
that we now we couldn't see it.

1635
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:51,747
What if that stain?

1636
01:33:51,892 --> 01:33:57,387
Even with the merest
merest breath...

1637
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:59,089
Go on.

1638
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:08,835
Pierre, could it... be that
that stain is radium?

1639
01:34:29,864 --> 01:34:36,963
Pierre. It's there. Our radium.

1640
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,937
It's there. It's there.

1641
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:46,779
Pierre.

1642
01:34:56,257 --> 01:35:03,857
Pierre. It's there. It's there.
It's there.

1643
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:08,699
Oh, Pierre.

1644
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,030
Where are they?

1645
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:12,537
Are they in Paris or go
wherever they are.

1646
01:35:12,673 --> 01:35:13,901
I am not going to tell you
where they are.

1647
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:16,509
But, Dr. Curie
I am the representative

1648
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:17,906
of the London Times

1649
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:19,569
and there are
representatives here

1650
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,205
from the presses of all the great
nations in the world.

1651
01:35:22,349 --> 01:35:24,510
Don't Dr.
and Madame Curie realize

1652
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:26,381
they can't hide from the press?

1653
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,011
The whole world is on fire
from their discovery.

1654
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:31,522
The publics want to know
about them.

1655
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:33,524
We have heard that
they had refused

1656
01:35:33,661 --> 01:35:35,458
to take in money for their radium

1657
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:37,860
that they are giving it
to the world.

1658
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:39,727
The Nobel Prize to a woman.

1659
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:42,097
These are important matters
Dr. curie

1660
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,760
and the world must be told
about them.

1661
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:45,872
Yes, the public must know.

1662
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,064
Did they give it for free?

1663
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,267
Where are they now?

1664
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,278
Gentlemen
all that I know is Pierre

1665
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,780
and Marie are very tired.

1666
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,474
They have been interviewed
so much that

1667
01:35:57,618 --> 01:35:59,586
I can't see there is any more to
tell that

1668
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,585
the public would be interested in.

1669
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:02,814
They're sick.

1670
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:06,256
They've gone away
on a holiday to rest.

1671
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:09,294
Now, it's utterly impossible
for any newspaperman

1672
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,591
in the world to try to interview

1673
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:13,893
Dr. or Madame Curie
at the present time

1674
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:15,262
I'm sorry.

1675
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,368
Excuse me.

1676
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:28,203
I am from The Courier
the newspaper in Grandovland.

1677
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:30,749
Do you think
I could see Madame Curie?

1678
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:32,785
I'm afraid you can't see her.

1679
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,410
They've come here to rest.

1680
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,989
It's their first holiday
in five years.

1681
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,092
You wouldn't want to disturb them.

1682
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:42,059
Perhaps you could
tell me something about her.

1683
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:45,563
I can't go back without
some sort of story.

1684
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:53,196
Would you like to have something
for your paper

1685
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:54,466
that very people know yet?

1686
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:56,701
Oh, I certainly would.

1687
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,745
Well. Put in your newspaper that

1688
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:03,441
the University has granted Dr.
and Mme. Curie

1689
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:08,021
a splendid new laboratory with
many rooms

1690
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:11,955
the latest equipment
many assistants.

1691
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:15,323
It will be presented to them in
a formal ceremony next week.

1692
01:37:15,462 --> 01:37:17,020
Next week?

1693
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:21,700
There. Fair enough.

1694
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,600
That's fine, Madame.
That's wonderful.

1695
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:27,400
I don't know how to thank you.

1696
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:30,237
I can tell you
I was scared of meeting Mme. Curie

1697
01:37:30,377 --> 01:37:32,538
but it was rather important to me.

1698
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,910
You see
this is my first assignment

1699
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:36,414
if I could have
gotten the interview

1700
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:39,018
it would help a lot.

1701
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:41,451
Well, monsieur.
You can tell your newspaper that

1702
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:44,649
you got your interview
with Mme. Curie.

1703
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,056
Madame. Good bye.

1704
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:52,257
Are you... are you Mme. Curie?

1705
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,835
Yes. And this is my daughter
Irene.

1706
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,598
It's a new bicycle so she has to
show it off.

1707
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,468
And now... Mommy...

1708
01:38:00,608 --> 01:38:03,600
Oh, yes. My baby. This is E.

1709
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:04,870
She's been a good baby?

1710
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:05,740
Very good, Madame.

1711
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,812
Been very good, darling?

1712
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,710
Yes. Wei, Madame.

1713
01:38:08,849 --> 01:38:09,781
Did she drink her milk?

1714
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,849
Yes.

1715
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:12,748
Alright... Wei, Madame.

1716
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,354
Well, keep her out
in the airy deck.

1717
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:16,149
Alright. Off you go.

1718
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:20,327
Now she made a grand tour
of the garden

1719
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,955
And now
you'll excuse me. Good bye.

1720
01:38:24,098 --> 01:38:25,122
Good bye.

1721
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:37,941
Know what I'm doing? Pierre.

1722
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,443
I thought you were asleep.

1723
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:43,812
No. I'm walking through
the new laboratory.

1724
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,179
Don't imagine it too grand.

1725
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:47,651
It might not come up
to your expectations.

1726
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:52,122
And at the moment, I'm walking down
the long white hall.

1727
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:53,351
And I'm with you?

1728
01:38:53,494 --> 01:38:55,325
Yes, you are with me.

1729
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,623
Now
I'm examining your work table.

1730
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,232
I don't believe it's large enough.

1731
01:38:59,366 --> 01:39:00,128
How's yours?

1732
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:02,758
Oh, yes. I haven't got there yet.

1733
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:04,029
It will be exciting, won't it?

1734
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:05,502
When we walk in the first time.

1735
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:08,540
Yes. It will be wonderful to
get back to work again.

1736
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:10,507
We lost so much time.

1737
01:39:10,644 --> 01:39:11,406
Oh, Pierre.

1738
01:39:11,545 --> 01:39:13,536
The time we spent here
hasn't been lost

1739
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:16,013
We got our strength back.

1740
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,549
Yes, that's true.

1741
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:21,348
We were ill, both of us
more than we knew.

1742
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:23,149
You know, when we first came here

1743
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,850
I used to
have fantastically morbid

1744
01:39:25,993 --> 01:39:26,982
thoughts sometimes.

1745
01:39:27,127 --> 01:39:28,151
What do you mean?

1746
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:32,493
Well, everyday that passed seem
so completely lost.

1747
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:36,330
I have a feeling that
I didn't have much time to lose,

1748
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:40,736
that my days were... well, it...

1749
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,341
that I mustn't waste them

1750
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:44,910
that I have to drive ahead quickly
in order to have time

1751
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:47,741
to finish everything
I wanted to finish

1752
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:50,349
It's odd how one's mind would...

1753
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:55,718
Why, Marie.

1754
01:39:55,856 --> 01:39:58,256
What a horrible thought to have.

1755
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:00,053
It's just because I was so ill.

1756
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:02,458
How could such a thought
entered your mind.

1757
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:03,722
Oh, darling.
Don't take it so seriously

1758
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:05,058
It frightens me.

1759
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,689
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
It was nothing.

1760
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:08,495
It's because I was so worn out.

1761
01:40:08,635 --> 01:40:10,034
You know, Marie, how tired I was.

1762
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:13,765
Pierre. If one of us
should ever go

1763
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:15,875
the other couldn't go on alone.

1764
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,843
Couldn't be expected of us
could it?

1765
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:20,310
Oh, Marie. I've upset you.

1766
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,642
Could it, Pierre?

1767
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,749
You were wrong, Marie.

1768
01:40:27,888 --> 01:40:30,379
Whatever happens
if one should go

1769
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:32,287
the other must stay on.

1770
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:34,553
One must work just the same.

1771
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,856
But I for one had no intention of
going anywhere

1772
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:39,192
except to our
wonderful new laboratory.

1773
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,927
Only one more week.
Just think of it.

1774
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:44,833
After all this waiting
only one more week.

1775
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,240
Pierre?

1776
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,809
Yes, dear.

1777
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:52,275
Come back here.

1778
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,471
Ha?

1779
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:55,081
Come back.

1780
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:58,980
What is it?

1781
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:02,088
I want to tell you something.
Sit down.

1782
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:09,557
Well? What is it?

1783
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:16,697
So hard.
I just can't find the words.

1784
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:20,364
Pierre, are you proud of me?

1785
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:21,735
Marie.

1786
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,900
Because I'm so proud of you.

1787
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:28,538
I'm so proud that sometimes
I think I'll burst.

1788
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:31,412
You're a very great man, Pierre.

1789
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:35,420
Not the way the world means.
Just you.

1790
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:40,425
Your kindness, your gentleness
and your wisdom.

1791
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:44,520
I love you, Pierre, so deeply.

1792
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:48,465
I never dreamed...

1793
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:52,129
I'm so thankful, Pierre.

1794
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:55,173
That's what I wanted to tell you.

1795
01:41:55,309 --> 01:42:00,440
That's what I thought
you'll always know.

1796
01:42:08,822 --> 01:42:12,349
France sees it fit to bestow
the famous scientific couple

1797
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:13,790
a truly great honor

1798
01:42:13,927 --> 01:42:17,954
in reward for their services
to science and to mankind.

1799
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:21,033
Well, are you truly impressed?

1800
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:22,362
The president and faulty of

1801
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:24,767
the University of Paris
will present Pierre and

1802
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:27,373
Mme. Curie with a fully
equipped laboratory

1803
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,237
with which to carry on

1804
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,708
their many experiments
they have opened the gateway to.

1805
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:36,680
At 6:30 on 19th, April
that's today, you know.

1806
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,546
There will be
a formal presentation

1807
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:39,879
of the laboratory at which

1808
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,614
the world famous couple
will appear.

1809
01:42:42,756 --> 01:42:44,815
Not bad, eh? Not bad.

1810
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,789
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, Father.

1811
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:48,087
Good morning
Good morning, children.

1812
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,525
What's the matter
with this place today?

1813
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:51,324
After all
it was no different than

1814
01:42:51,465 --> 01:42:52,762
any other day, isn't it?
This house is in a turmoil.

1815
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,765
Everything is upside down
topsy turvy

1816
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:55,994
nothing in its place.

1817
01:42:56,136 --> 01:42:57,933
Where is your mother?
I haven't seen her for hours.

1818
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,561
I don't know how I'm going to
remember everything.

1819
01:42:59,706 --> 01:43:03,073
And, ah...

1820
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:07,041
Where's my coffee? I'm late.

1821
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,115
Oh. Thank you, Lucille.

1822
01:43:09,249 --> 01:43:10,511
Don't know
where your mother has gone.

1823
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:11,640
The house without a woman

1824
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,116
I don't understand.

1825
01:43:14,054 --> 01:43:15,453
Marie?

1826
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,580
Mother's in there.

1827
01:43:19,059 --> 01:43:21,755
What's she doing in there?

1828
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:27,759
Mother's in there.
Mother's in there.

1829
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:28,959
Marie.

1830
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:31,593
I wouldn't go in there, Pierre
if I were you.

1831
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:33,729
She's having the last fitting
on her new dress

1832
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:36,536
she's going to wear tonight
for the presentation.

1833
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:39,168
It's supposed to be a surprise.

1834
01:43:39,313 --> 01:43:42,942
Oh, good. Good.
That's a very sound idea.

1835
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:44,983
Yeah. Remember
I didn't tell you.

1836
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:46,244
No.

1837
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:52,417
Pardon me, is Dr. Pierre here?

1838
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,359
That's him.

1839
01:43:56,496 --> 01:43:59,863
Oh. Mme. Curie would like to
see you.

1840
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:16,640
You like it, Pierre?

1841
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:19,547
It's for this evening
for the ceremony

1842
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:21,881
You look very beautiful, Marie.

1843
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,351
You really like it?

1844
01:44:25,492 --> 01:44:31,988
I do. Very much.
What color is that?

1845
01:44:32,132 --> 01:44:34,862
It's, ah, very deep red.

1846
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:43,031
You want to have some kind of
a little ornament, haven't you?

1847
01:44:43,176 --> 01:44:44,575
Oh, nonsense.

1848
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:45,700
Yes. Yes, you should.

1849
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:47,211
Something... something bright.

1850
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:50,180
I've seen them on women.
They look nice

1851
01:44:57,557 --> 01:44:59,718
Now you're making me
self-conscious.

1852
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:05,127
Oh, I was thinking what a pity
evening dress becomes you so.

1853
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:06,357
But there you are

1854
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,469
we just haven't
had the time, have we?

1855
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:15,907
Oh, look at that.

1856
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:17,738
Our beautiful day ruined.

1857
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:20,813
Oh, I was going to spend the day
in the park with the children.

1858
01:45:21,748 --> 01:45:22,772
Well, I must be off.

1859
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,247
I have a hundred things
to do today.

1860
01:45:24,384 --> 01:45:25,749
I promise to go to the institute

1861
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:27,217
I have to look at
the proofs of my paper

1862
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:29,345
from my publisher
and endless thing.

1863
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:30,888
I want to clean everything up and

1864
01:45:31,024 --> 01:45:32,321
start fresh from the laboratory
in the morning.

1865
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:32,823
You mustn't be late.

1866
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:34,426
You must allowed yourself
time to dress

1867
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:35,960
Madame. Madame, the pins.

1868
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:37,188
Oh. Oh.

1869
01:45:37,331 --> 01:45:39,458
Perhaps one day
I'll get a new dress suit.

1870
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:40,395
You know I have had mine

1871
01:45:40,534 --> 01:45:42,024
since I got my Doctors degree.

1872
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:43,136
Looks bad on me, isn't it?

1873
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:44,134
No, Pierre.

1874
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,068
You look very handsome in anything

1875
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:47,400
Thank you, Marie.

1876
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:49,768
Good bye. Good bye, darling.

1877
01:45:52,713 --> 01:45:54,374
They're always
calling for us at six.

1878
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:55,947
I'll be here.

1879
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57,880
Don't forget your rubbers. No.

1880
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,146
Or your umbrella.

1881
01:46:02,222 --> 01:46:02,916
Good bye.

1882
01:46:03,056 --> 01:46:05,320
Good bye, Pierre. Pierre...

1883
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:46,993
Is there something I can show you
Monsieur?

1884
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:50,570
I would like to buy a pair of
earrings for a lady.

1885
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:52,171
We're going to a party tonight.

1886
01:46:52,305 --> 01:46:53,203
Yes, Monsieur.

1887
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,274
Did you have anything special
in mind?

1888
01:46:55,409 --> 01:46:58,401
Well, I've seen women
wearing earrings

1889
01:46:58,545 --> 01:47:00,604
that I thought were very pretty.

1890
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,375
Of course, I would like to
get something

1891
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,575
that would match the lady's gown.

1892
01:47:04,718 --> 01:47:06,413
May I ask the color of the gown
monsieur?

1893
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:08,145
It's dark red.

1894
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,089
It's rather a special gown.

1895
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:16,525
Not blow, of course, but...

1896
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:18,255
What do you think of these
Monsieur.

1897
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:21,492
They're amethysts
They're very lovely.

1898
01:47:21,635 --> 01:47:23,102
Oh, yes, aren't they.

1899
01:47:23,236 --> 01:47:24,794
And what are these?

1900
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,371
Those are garnets.

1901
01:47:26,506 --> 01:47:31,307
Really? They're both lovely.

1902
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:32,844
I hardly know...

1903
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:35,641
It would depend on the shape of
the lady's face.

1904
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:38,512
Is it oval or round?

1905
01:47:38,652 --> 01:47:42,418
I would say that
her face was oval.

1906
01:47:42,556 --> 01:47:44,148
Yes, oval.

1907
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,259
And is she blond or...

1908
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:49,260
Blond, definitely.
But not too blond.

1909
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:53,162
I mean, she can't... well

1910
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,097
just blond.

1911
01:47:55,235 --> 01:48:00,172
And her hair is sort of gold
you know

1912
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:01,239
Gold?

1913
01:48:01,374 --> 01:48:05,470
Yes. And her eyes are gray.

1914
01:48:05,612 --> 01:48:13,109
Very calm gray.
The coloring is very lovely.

1915
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:18,885
Sort of smooth skin
and nice delicate, coloring

1916
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:24,156
and well I...

1917
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:26,697
I don't know if it will be
of any help to you

1918
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:31,236
but the lady is quite beautiful.

1919
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:05,523
Lovely. You look very beautiful
my dear.

1920
01:50:05,665 --> 01:50:06,893
Thank you.

1921
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:10,093
It's rather unusual to be praised
for the way I look.

1922
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:11,567
I'm sure you could have
had that praise

1923
01:50:11,705 --> 01:50:13,536
from men if you'd had wished it.

1924
01:50:13,673 --> 01:50:15,573
Thank you, Father.

1925
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:18,974
I don't understand
Pierre being late today of all days.

1926
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:21,410
Well, you know, Pierre.

1927
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:23,209
I brought in some wine.

1928
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:25,841
I thought we might all drink
to that new laboratory

1929
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:27,180
before you go.

1930
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:30,289
Oh, that was thoughtful of you
Father.

1931
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,891
That must be Professor Poirot
and Pierre's not here.

1932
01:50:33,026 --> 01:50:34,186
Let me.

1933
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:41,889
Pierre?

1934
01:51:47,467 --> 01:51:52,530
Mme. Curie, it is my painful
due to inform you that...

1935
01:51:52,672 --> 01:51:57,075
your husband has been
the victim of a street accident.

1936
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:59,770
He was instantly killed.

1937
01:52:01,147 --> 01:52:03,445
It came at such no pain.

1938
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:49,621
Has she any better?

1939
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:51,162
Just the same.

1940
01:52:51,297 --> 01:52:53,356
I can't get her to speak to me.

1941
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:56,094
I'm frightened.

1942
01:52:56,236 --> 01:52:57,601
Is she in there?

1943
01:52:57,737 --> 01:52:58,965
Yes.

1944
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:24,689
Forgive me, if I intrude.

1945
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:30,633
I do so as Pierre's old friend
as your old friend and teacher.

1946
01:53:31,704 --> 01:53:34,400
Please try to
attend to what I say.

1947
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:37,533
Try to hear my words.

1948
01:53:37,677 --> 01:53:41,636
Think what Pierre
what he should do.

1949
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:45,217
How he would want you to live now.

1950
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:47,819
It is my believed that
he would wish you

1951
01:53:47,954 --> 01:53:52,982
to continue his and yours.

1952
01:54:13,179 --> 01:54:15,841
My friend...

1953
01:54:15,982 --> 01:54:20,715
I know how much
the laboratory meant to Pierre.

1954
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:25,655
I know how much hurt
if it wasn't to be yours.

1955
01:54:25,792 --> 01:54:27,783
It was his dream that someday

1956
01:54:27,927 --> 01:54:32,523
you and he
would stand there together.

1957
01:54:32,665 --> 01:54:34,326
I know it is very hard for you

1958
01:54:34,467 --> 01:54:36,458
to think of going on by yourself

1959
01:54:36,603 --> 01:54:41,370
when you have done
everything together so many years.

1960
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:45,876
One must go on working
just the same.

1961
01:54:46,012 --> 01:54:49,038
You must find somewhere
within yourself

1962
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:55,712
the strength to carry on
Pierre's work and you own. Ha?

1963
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:32,480
Ten years ago
you told me so often that

1964
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:34,525
you were impressed
by something I said

1965
01:55:34,661 --> 01:55:37,221
when you were a student
in my class.

1966
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:39,524
I spoke of Newton and Galileo

1967
01:55:39,666 --> 01:55:44,035
and I said that probably none of
you would ever reach so high

1968
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:47,662
to get the star
in your fingertips.

1969
01:55:47,807 --> 01:55:50,401
I was wrong.

1970
01:55:52,612 --> 01:55:58,175
I have, too, seen you reaching to
the high place of knowledge

1971
01:55:58,318 --> 01:56:02,277
and get your star
under your fingertips.

1972
01:56:04,991 --> 01:56:10,987
Marie, there are more stars.

1973
01:59:23,389 --> 01:59:27,189
The Faculty of Science
of University of Paris invites you

1974
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:31,262
to attend the ceremony honored by
the presence of Mme. Curie

1975
01:59:31,397 --> 01:59:33,991
to commemorate
the twenty-fifth anniversary

1976
01:59:34,133 --> 01:59:36,363
of the discovery of radium.

1977
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:41,197
Yes, she was famous now.

1978
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:46,573
This frail, stubborn, eager woman
had carried on her great work

1979
01:59:46,712 --> 01:59:49,340
for a quarter of a century.

1980
02:00:08,367 --> 02:00:10,460
Mme. Curie.

1981
02:00:53,412 --> 02:00:57,940
Even now, after twenty-five years
of intensive research,

1982
02:00:58,084 --> 02:01:01,576
we feel there is a great deal
still to be done.

1983
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:03,746
We have made discoveries.

1984
02:01:03,889 --> 02:01:07,723
Pierre Curie, in the suggestions
we found in his notes

1985
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,124
and in thoughts
he expressed to me

1986
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:12,823
has helped to guide us to him.

1987
02:01:12,965 --> 02:01:16,401
But no one of us can do much

1988
02:01:16,535 --> 02:01:22,405
if each of us perhaps
can catch some glimpse knowledge

1989
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:25,533
which modestly
insufficient itself

1990
02:01:25,678 --> 02:01:30,115
may add to man's dream of truth.

1991
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:34,379
It is by these small candles
in our darkness that

1992
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:38,217
we see before us little by little

1993
02:01:38,357 --> 02:01:41,793
the dim outlines of
that great plan

1994
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:44,691
that shapes the universe.

1995
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:48,994
And I am among those who think
that for this reason,

1996
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:56,337
science has great beauty and with
its great spiritual strength

1997
02:01:56,475 --> 02:02:02,607
will in time cleanse this world
of its evils

1998
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:11,679
it's ignorance, poverty, diseases
wars and heartaches

1999
02:02:14,827 --> 02:02:18,729
Look for the clear light of truth

2000
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:23,563
Look for unknown new roads

2001
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:28,663
even when men's sight is
keener far from now.

2002
02:02:28,808 --> 02:02:33,939
Divine wonder will never fail us.

2003
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:38,779
Every age has its own dream.

2004
02:02:38,918 --> 02:02:42,547
Leave then the dreams
of yesterday

2005
02:02:42,688 --> 02:02:47,455
You take the torch of knowledge

2006
02:02:47,593 --> 02:02:51,791
and build the palace
of the future.
