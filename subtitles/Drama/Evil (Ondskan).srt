1
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:58,093
<i>All Umbrella staff must wear</i>
<i>their identity tags at all times.</i>

2
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,807
<i>All radiation badges will be collected</i>
<i>at 5:00 p.m. this afternoon.</i>

3
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,810
Thank you! God!

4
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,899
- Some people.
- Yeah.

5
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,472
- May be I won't show this time.
- Why not?

6
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,307
Because I'm busy.

7
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,566
It's nothing. Fire drill.

8
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,329
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

9
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,252
- Shit!
- Hey, what the hell is going on?

10
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,213
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- Damn it, I'm trying!

11
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,423
The experiments! Move them!

12
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,186
Shouldn't the doors open or something?

13
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,356
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

14
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,531
Hello? Hello?

15
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,408
What's happening?

16
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,537
<i>Line's dead.</i>

17
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,084
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

18
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,045
- What about the ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

19
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,007
There's no fire here! No fire!

20
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,469
- The code doesn't work!
- No fire!

21
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,847
<i>- What's wrong with you?</i>
<i>- The door won't open!</i>

22
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,223
And this water isn't going anywhere.

23
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,475
- What?
- It's a sealed room.

24
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
- Help me with the door!
- Oh, fuck the doors!

25
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,491
We have to get out of here.
What's going on?

26
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,619
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

27
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,538
- We have to get out of here!
- Take it easy.

28
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,749
- You take it easy!
- Quiet!

29
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,755
What is that?

30
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,188
Oh, my God.

31
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,595
Halon!

32
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,935
Stop it!

33
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,854
Stop it! Stop!

34
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,401
<i>Help!</i>

35
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,892
Let me see.

36
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,776
We're gonna have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building!

37
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,695
Here, give me a hand.

38
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,533
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

39
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,704
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through. I'll get help.

40
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,005
I'm stuck. You're gonna have to push.

41
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,966
That's it.

42
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,342
A bit more.

43
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,387
What was that?

44
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,976
Oh, Christ! it's the brakes! Get out!

45
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,020
- I can't move!
- We have to get out of here!

46
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,030
Push her out of the way!

47
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,242
Pull me back inside!

48
00:11:44,912 --> 00:12:41,009
Hello?

49
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,283
- Who are you?
- Move!

50
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,327
Don't touch me! Stop!

51
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,120
- Get away from me!
- Down!

52
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,218
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

53
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,221
I told you, I'm a cop!

54
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,395
You're breaking my arm!

55
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,238
Report.

56
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,701
Report now.

57
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,036
What?

58
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,456
I want your report, soldier.

59
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,458
I don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,962
Sir, the house's primary defenses
have been activated.

61
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,215
She's probably still suffering
the side effects.

62
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,591
What are you doing with us?

63
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,801
What about the cop?

64
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,679
Matthew Addison. I'm not getting a match.

65
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,014
Who are you?

66
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,351
I just transferred. They probably
don't even have me on file yet.

67
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,937
The locals are inefficient. it's possible.

68
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,106
Should I secure him here?

69
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,112
No. We take him with us.

70
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,574
You can't do this!

71
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,120
Blow me.

72
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,624
Prep for entry to the Hive.

73
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,568
Power's down.

74
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,695
- So fix it.
- I'm on it.

75
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,753
Are you done yet?

76
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,755
Jumpy.

77
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,519
Stand clear!

78
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,260
- You got a problem?
- How's that door?

79
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,387
- It's sealed shut.
- Let me.

80
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,613
Jumpy?

81
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,773
Lie still. Lie still!

82
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,528
Watch this light. Follow it.

83
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,700
- Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
- Three.

84
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,785
Good.

85
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,703
Now tell me your name.

86
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,127
I don't know.

87
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,005
He's fine.
Memory loss, just like the other one.

88
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,298
Let's open that door.

89
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,321
Listen to me.

90
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,950
I want to know who you people are
and I want to know what's going on here.

91
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,453
Now!

92
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,624
You and I have the same employer.

93
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,876
We all work for the Umbrella Corporation.

94
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,254
The mansion above us
is an emergency entrance to the Hive.

95
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,425
You are security operatives
placed there to protect that entrance.

96
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,344
What about this?

97
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,222
Your marriage is a fake.

98
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,642
Just part of your cover
to protect the secrecy of the Hive.

99
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,518
And what is the Hive?

100
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,395
Show them.

101
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,399
Accessing schematic of the Hive.

102
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,652
Raccoon City, nearest urban center.

103
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,029
<i>The mansion where we found you</i>

104
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,740
<i>and through which we gained</i>
<i>access to the train</i>

105
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,826
<i>which, in turn, brought us to the Hive.</i>

106
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:53,000
<i>The Hive itself is located underground</i>
<i>deep beneath the streets of Raccoon City.</i>

107
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,671
<i>A top-secret research facility</i>

108
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,423
<i>owned and operated</i>
<i>by the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

109
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:04,178
<i>the Hive houses over 500 technicians,</i>
<i>scientists and support staff.</i>

110
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,473
<i>They live and work underground.</i>

111
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,268
<i>Their research is of the
highest importance.</i>

112
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,812
<i>Lts nature is classified.</i>

113
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,775
<i>Our position on the map</i>
<i>is indicated by heat signature.</i>

114
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,624
Why can't I remember anything?

115
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,461
The Hive has its own defense mechanisms,
all computer-controlled.

116
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,424
<i>A nerve gas was released into the house.</i>

117
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,178
Primary effect of the gas,

118
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,974
complete unconsciousness
lasting anything up to four hours.

119
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,561
Secondary effects are varied,
but can include acute memory loss.

120
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,563
- For how long?
- Subjective.

121
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,398
An hour, day, week.

122
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,234
So you're saying this place was attacked?

123
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,571
I'm afraid things are
a little more complicated than that.

124
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,116
Sir! We've breached the Hive.

125
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,252
J.D.

126
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,240
Got it.

127
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,630
Halon content has dissipated.

128
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,820
Makes it easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

129
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,843
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

130
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,231
- Status.
- Red Queen is locked onto us.

131
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,358
She knows that we're here.

132
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,111
Who's the Red Queen?

133
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,321
State-of-the-art artificial intelligence.

134
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,949
<i>She is the computer that controls the Hive.</i>

135
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,798
This is gonna slow us down.

136
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,219
Our route to the Queen
takes us straight through these labs.

137
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,222
Rain, J.D., see how bad the flooding is.

138
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,850
Kaplan, find us an alternate route.

139
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,397
What happened here?

140
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,653
Five hours ago, Red Queen went homicidal.

141
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,572
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone down here.

142
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,074
- Jesus.
- When we realized what was happening,

143
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,285
my team was dispatched to shut her down.

144
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:59,747
- Why did she do it?
- That we don't know.

145
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,666
But outside interference is a possibility.

146
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,793
Jesus!

147
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,393
Hey. You okay?

148
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,900
- Here.
- No.

149
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,568
- I'm fine.
- Please, come on.

150
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,320
It's cold in here.

151
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,788
Are you..

152
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:49,129
Do you remember anything
from before this?

153
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:55,094
No. Nothing before the train.

154
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,847
And you?

155
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,477
No. Nothing.

156
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,940
I found an alternate route,
but it's gonna cost us time.

157
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:13,529
We double back, cut through Dining Hall B,
then we're right on track.

158
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,338
Sir, no go. The whole level's flooded.

159
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,841
All right, we're behind schedule.

160
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,968
So let's move it.

161
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,475
Come on.

162
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,067
Poor bastards.

163
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,450
Dining Hall B.

164
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,702
That's what it says on the map.

165
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,163
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

166
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,124
Maybe the corporation's
keeping a few secrets down here.

167
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,752
Something you're not supposed to see.

168
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,090
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner here
and secure the exit.

169
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,343
Sir, halon levels
are nonexistent in this room.

170
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,136
I think the system malfunctioned.

171
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,681
All right. There may be survivors.

172
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,350
Give me a search line, but keep it tight.

173
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,771
Move it.

174
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,701
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

175
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,290
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

176
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,503
I don't blame you.

177
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,840
<i>What do they keep in these things?</i>

178
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,425
<i>How do I know?</i>

179
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,660
What's taking so long?

180
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:53,290
Red Queen's defenses are in place.
She's making it difficult.

181
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,588
Let's pack it up.

182
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,435
You stay here.

183
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,097
<i>The lights are automated.</i>
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

184
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,785
- Transmitter in position.
<i>- Roger.</i>

185
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,620
Running the bypass.

186
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:34,808
Checkmate.

187
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,819
Move up.

188
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,578
- What is that?
- That's what will shut the Queen down.

189
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,496
Delivers a massive electrical charge.

190
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,833
Scrambles the mainframe
and forces it to reboot.

191
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,011
Some kind of dormant defense mechanism.

192
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,430
- Opening the door tripped it.
<i>- Put it back to sleep.</i>

193
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,098
Working on it.

194
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,604
- Would you open that door now, please?
- I'm trying.

195
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,690
<i>Hold your positions. Everyone stay calm.</i>

196
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,192
What's that?

197
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,528
- Kaplan, quick!
- We gotta get them out of there!

198
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,989
- Kaplan, you've gotta hurry!
- Come on!

199
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,700
Down! Get down!

200
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,080
- Look out! Something's killing them!
- Jesus! Come on, man.

201
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,915
Don't do this to me!

202
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,001
Medic! Medic!

203
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,470
- Open the door!
- Open this door!

204
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,597
- I am trying.
- Stay conscious.

205
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,183
You're going into shock. Stay awake!

206
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,687
- I am almost there.
- Sir! it's coming back!

207
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,480
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

208
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,190
Well, try harder!

209
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,900
It's coming back!

210
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,994
Oh, God!

211
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,871
- Just do it!
- I'm almost there.

212
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,748
Come on!

213
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,961
- Shit!
- Got it.

214
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,571
All right.

215
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,740
Let's do it.

216
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,576
Do what?

217
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,619
We have to complete the mission.

218
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,330
There is no way I'm going down there.

219
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,417
Her defenses are down.

220
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,127
Déjà vu, anyone?

221
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,857
Keep going.

222
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,227
Give me a hand.

223
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,828
<i>Get out! Get out! You can't be in here.</i>

224
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,538
Don't listen to anything she says.

225
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,832
She's a holographic representation
of the Red Queen.

226
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,333
<i>You have to get out!</i>

227
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,836
Modeled after
the head programmer's daughter.

228
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,046
She'll try to deceive us, confuse us.

229
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:20,051
<i>I wouldn't advise this. Disabling me</i>
<i>will result in loss of primary power.</i>

230
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,180
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

231
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,764
<i>I implore you.</i>

232
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,018
- Implore away.
<i>- Please?</i>

233
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,063
<i>Please?</i>

234
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,109
<i>You're all going to die down here.</i>

235
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:41,132
That pulse forces the circuit
breaker to shut down her
mainframe for 30 seconds.

236
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,678
After that, if I don't have her board,
she can reboot.

237
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,021
They're late.

238
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,699
I'm on it.

239
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,415
J.D., we got a survivor!

240
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,543
It's okay. We're here to help.

241
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,921
You seem to be in some serious..

242
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,262
Get off of me! Get off of me!

243
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:14,059
J.D., get her off of me
before I stab her ass!

244
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,104
Are you okay?

245
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:23,318
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk clean right out of me.

246
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,321
Stay down.

247
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,698
I'm warning you, stay down!

248
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,200
She's crazy.

249
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,163
Come any closer, and I'll fire.

250
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,457
I mean it!

251
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,835
Damn you.

252
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,567
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

253
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,986
Bitch isn't standing now.

254
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:15,036
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

255
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,624
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

256
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,837
She's gone. She's gone!

257
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,589
That's bullshit!

258
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,175
She fell right here, but she's gone!

259
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,929
Look, look at this.

260
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,390
There's blood, but it's not much.

261
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,269
Looks like it's coagulated.

262
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:42,856
- Yeah.
- It's not possible.

263
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,524
Why not?

264
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,946
Because blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

265
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,072
Can we go now?

266
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,951
We're not going anywhere
till the rest of the team get here.

267
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:04,252
- There's no one else coming.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

268
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,420
Wait.

269
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,714
Quiet.

270
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,751
Fuck!

271
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,670
- Don't come any closer!
- They're behind us.

272
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,339
Jesus!

273
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,927
They're everywhere.

274
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,846
They're everywhere. They're all around us.

275
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,162
I said stay back!

276
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,090
Why aren't they dying?

277
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,810
Watch the tank! The tank!

278
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,444
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

279
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,613
- Wait!
- Come on, let's go!

280
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,907
- Move!
- Keep moving! Come on!

281
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,037
Move!

282
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,093
I can help you get the virus.

283
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:21,723
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

284
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,075
Shit!

285
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,543
- We lost the others!
- Keep moving!

286
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,971
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

287
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,681
Come on, come on.

288
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,516
- Shit!
- Come on.

289
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,823
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

290
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,700
- Come on, man.
- Shit!

291
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,913
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

292
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,972
Come on.

293
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,019
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry up!

294
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,354
I'm running out of ammo!

295
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,815
Zero, four, three, two.. No, fuck!

296
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,151
- What?
- Zero, four, three..

297
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,779
- What is the code?
- Zero, four,

298
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,700
zero, three, one, nine, six, five.

299
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,036
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

300
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,998
- Shit!
- J.D., no!

301
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,295
Grab my hand, man! Come on!

302
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,047
Don't let go!

303
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,350
- J.D.!
- Rain!

304
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,611
Where are the bodies? Where did they go?

305
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,820
Fuck!

306
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,242
Whatever they are,
there's too many of them out there.

307
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,704
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

308
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,875
Lab coats, badges.
Those people used to work here!

309
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,461
All the people working here are dead.

310
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,589
Well, that isn't stopping them
from walking around.

311
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:45,510
Well, where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

312
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,970
When you cut the power,
you unlocked the doors.

313
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,931
You let them out.

314
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,401
We're never gonna make it to the surface.

315
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,149
<i>You are security operatives.</i>

316
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,861
Security operatives placed there
to protect that entrance.

317
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,832
I've got one in the
breech and an extra mag.

318
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,359
Lisa.

319
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,805
I can help you get the virus.

320
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,185
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

321
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,978
But?

322
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,356
- But there's gonna be a price.
- Name it.

323
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,199
- Who was she?
- My sister.

324
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:37,463
Corporations like Umbrella
think they're above the law.

325
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,216
But they're not.

326
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,056
There are hundreds of thousands
of us who think the same

327
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,849
all over the world.

328
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,313
Some of us provide information,

329
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,566
others give their support.

330
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,986
Some take more direct action.

331
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,489
Like you.

332
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,618
If your friends had been
a little more thorough,

333
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:10,663
they would've seen
right through my false lD.

334
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,251
Then all the red flags would've gone off..

335
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,879
Quantico, NSA, VICAP, all the rest.

336
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,342
There's no way
I could've infiltrated the Hive.

337
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,929
So you sent your sister.

338
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,477
We needed something concrete.

339
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,522
Anything to expose Umbrella to the press.

340
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,817
Proof of the research
that was going on down here.

341
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,444
What kind of research?

342
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,154
The illegal kind.

343
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,907
Genetic.

344
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,326
Viral.

345
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,668
My sister was going to smuggle out
a sample of the virus they were developing.

346
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,132
So how was she
going to make it out of here?

347
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:08,178
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

348
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:12,975
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

349
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,894
So why didn't she make it?

350
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,441
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.

351
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,360
Maybe they set her up.

352
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,280
Kept the virus for themselves.

353
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:32,202
Do you know how much the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

354
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,540
- What, worth all this?
- Yeah.

355
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,042
To someone.

356
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,301
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

357
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,178
- Close that door!
- They're right behind us!

358
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,267
Get off! Get off!

359
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,602
Stop it!

360
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,897
Son of a bitch!

361
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,775
- You okay?
- Yeah.

362
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,154
Right behind us. What about this door?

363
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:11,784
- They're waiting out there too.
- And that way?

364
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,412
It's a dead end. There's no way out
of the Queen's chamber.

365
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,914
So we wait.

366
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,584
If someone doesn't hear from you,
they'll send backup or something.

367
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,835
Right?

368
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,966
What? What's wrong?

369
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,386
We don't have much time.

370
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,681
You know those blast doors we passed
on the way in from the mansion?

371
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,518
They seal shut in just under an hour.

372
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:41,063
If we're not out of here by then,
we're not getting out.

373
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:45,484
What are you talking about?
They can't just bury us alive down here.

374
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:52,157
Containing the incident
is the only fail-safe plan they had

375
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,702
against possible contamination.

376
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:01,083
And you're only telling us this now,
when we're trapped

377
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,460
half a mile underground?

378
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,422
We have to find a way out of this room.

379
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,884
What are you doing?

380
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,015
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

381
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,936
- That is not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

382
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,776
That homicidal bitch killed my team.

383
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,487
That homicidal bitch
may be our only way out of here.

384
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:34,950
Considering the way she's been treated,
I'm sure she'll be happy to help us out.

385
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,785
That circuit breaker you
were talking about.

386
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,829
- Can you bypass it?
- Yeah.

387
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,205
So do it.

388
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,964
All right, circuit breaker is disabled.

389
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,634
This time if I hit the switch,
she won't be able to shut down.

390
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,052
She's gonna fry.

391
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,932
Kaplan?

392
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,643
The initial charge
must have damaged her boards.

393
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,062
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

394
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,107
<i>Things, I gather, have gone out of control.</i>

395
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,986
Give me that fucking switch right now.
I'm gonna fry your ass.

396
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,071
<i>I did warn you, didn't I?</i>

397
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,449
Tell us what's going on down here.

398
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,701
<i>Research and development.</i>

399
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,369
What about the T-virus?

400
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,414
<i>The T-virus was</i>
<i>a major medical breakthrough</i>

401
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:28,045
<i>although it clearly also possessed</i>
<i>highly profitable military applications.</i>

402
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,255
How does it explain those things out there?

403
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,842
<i>Even in death,</i>
<i>the human body still remains active.</i>

404
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,428
<i>Hair and fingernails continue to grow.</i>

405
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,138
<i>New cells are produced</i>

406
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,391
<i>and the brain itself</i>
<i>holds a small electrical charge</i>

407
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,894
<i>that takes months to dissipate.</i>

408
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,857
<i>The T-virus provides a massive jolt</i>
<i>both to cellular growth</i>

409
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,902
<i>and to those trace electrical impulses.</i>

410
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:55,989
<i>Put quite simply it reanimates the body.</i>

411
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,784
It brings the dead back to life?

412
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,118
<i>Not fully.</i>

413
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:03,455
<i>The subjects have</i>
<i>the simplest of motor functions.</i>

414
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,876
<i>Perhaps a little memory.</i>
<i>Virtually no intelligence.</i>

415
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:12,965
<i>They are driven by the basest of impulses,</i>
<i>the most basic of needs.</i>

416
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,424
Which is?

417
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,093
<i>The need to feed.</i>

418
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,558
How do you kill them?

419
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,353
<i>Severing the top of the spinal column</i>
<i>or massive trauma to the brain</i>

420
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,855
<i>are the most effective methods.</i>

421
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,400
You mean shoot them in the head.

422
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,902
Why did you kill everybody down here?

423
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,573
<i>The T-virus escaped</i>
<i>into the air conditioning system</i>

424
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,742
<i>and an uncontrolled pattern</i>
<i>of infection began.</i>

425
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,245
<i>The virus is protean,</i>

426
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,790
<i>changing from liquid to airborne</i>
<i>to blood transmission</i>

427
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:49,293
<i>depending on its environment.</i>

428
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,837
<i>It's almost impossible to kill.</i>

429
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:57,676
<i>I couldn't allow it to escape
from the Hive, so I took steps.</i>

430
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,346
- Steps.
<i>- You must understand.</i>

431
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,933
<i>Those who become infected,</i>
<i>I can't allow you to leave.</i>

432
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,935
Whoa. We're not infected.

433
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,773
<i>Just one bite, one scratch</i>
<i>from these creatures is sufficient</i>

434
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,443
<i>and then you become one of them.</i>

435
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,949
<i>A check of my systems indicates</i>
<i>my main drive circuit breaker</i>

436
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,160
<i>has been disabled.</i>

437
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,745
<i>May I ask why?</i>

438
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,956
Insurance. We need a way out of here.

439
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,084
If you refuse to help at any time,
we flip the switch.

440
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,544
Understand?

441
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,723
After you.

442
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,486
- What the hell is this place?
- The utility tunnels.

443
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:01,615
They run underneath the Hive
for water, gas and power lines.

444
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,630
- It's been in here before.
- Keep moving.

445
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,216
- We're going around in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave us.

446
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,010
- Why are you listening to her?
- Enough already!

447
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:26,765
We have no choice but to keep moving
'cause those things are right behind us.

448
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,482
That mesh isn't gonna hold. Keep moving.

449
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,655
Jesus Christ! Hold it!
There's too many of them!

450
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,659
- Jesus!
- Fuck!

451
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,883
Up on the pipes. Up on the pipes!

452
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,094
Quickly, everyone!

453
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,680
- Let's go!
- Come on! There's a way up!

454
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,640
Watch out! Keep them back!

455
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,977
Go on up! Move it!

456
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,150
Shit. Okay.

457
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:31,747
Get over here! There's too many of them!
Come on! Go, go, go!

458
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,874
Go on!

459
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,835
Go! Go! I can manage!

460
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,256
Gotcha!

461
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,881
Rain? Rain.

462
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,425
What?

463
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,303
We have to do something
about your wounds.

464
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,180
I'm fine.

465
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,767
I said I'm fine.

466
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,194
You like that, don't you? Huh?

467
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,739
You like the way it tastes, don't you?

468
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,910
Like the taste of that?

469
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,253
She was right.

470
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,341
We're all gonna die down here.

471
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,468
No. We're getting out.

472
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,012
All of us.

473
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,308
Kaplan, are you okay?

474
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,867
Oh, God!

475
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,587
Hold on!

476
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,603
- Help him.
- I can't.

477
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:44,522
- What are you waiting for?
- I can't focus!

478
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,736
I can't see!

479
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,535
- Kaplan, go up!
- Get up there!

480
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,497
You almost got it. Keep going!

481
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,541
- Come on! Come on!
- You can do it!

482
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,044
You got it!

483
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,005
- Okay, Kaplan.
- Just stay there!

484
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,132
Hold on. We're gonna come get you.

485
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,886
Cut this wire and throw it to him.
Then we can go get him.

486
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,221
Hold on!

487
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,187
That's lucky.

488
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,733
I want you to go.

489
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:37,117
- We're not leaving you, Kaplan.
- Yes, you are.

490
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,244
- No.
- You can't kill all of them.

491
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:43,081
And I'm not going anywhere.

492
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,709
I want you to go. Now!

493
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,003
Please.

494
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,421
Just do it.

495
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:52,590
Just do it now!

496
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,467
Please.

497
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,762
Go!

498
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,126
You're gonna have to work for your meal!

499
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:01,076
Come on.

500
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,171
Give me your arm. Up over my shoulder.

501
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,548
Ready? There we go.

502
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,259
When I get out of here

503
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,887
I think I'm gonna get laid.

504
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,266
Yeah. You might want
to clean up a little bit first.

505
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,401
Hey, wait.

506
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,741
Are you okay?

507
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:16,711
Blue for the virus. Green
for the antivirus.

508
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,007
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking about?

509
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,092
There's a cure.

510
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,638
The process can be reversed.

511
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,182
There's a cure!

512
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,100
You're gonna be okay!

513
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,437
I was beginning to worry.

514
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,822
This is where they kept the T-virus.

515
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,201
How do you know all this?

516
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,331
Because I was gonna steal it.

517
01:10:56,168 --> 01:10:58,461
I was your sister's contact.

518
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,131
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

519
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,301
- You caused all of this.
- I can't remember.

520
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,095
The truth.

521
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:09,264
I don't remember the truth.

522
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,383
I don't understand!

523
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,887
It's gone.

524
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,181
It's not there.

525
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:54,726
I can't.

526
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,937
I just can't.

527
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,689
- It's over.
- No.

528
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,365
<i>I can help you get the virus.</i>

529
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,786
I have access to security codes,
surveillance plans, the works.

530
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,080
But there's gonna be a price.

531
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,624
Name it.

532
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:23,421
You have to guarantee me that
you will bring this corporation down.

533
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,149
Spence?

534
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,420
Thank you.

535
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,391
Spence?

536
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,336
We can still make it out of here.
Come with me.

537
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,216
We can have everything we've ever wanted.

538
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:55,847
Money's out there waiting.
You wouldn't believe how much.

539
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:00,393
Ls that how you thought
all my dreams were gonna come true?

540
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,189
Please. I wouldn't want to shoot you.

541
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,316
Might need the bullets.

542
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,862
Back off.

543
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,077
I won't take any part in this.

544
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:23,291
Okay, but you can't just
wash your hands of this.

545
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:26,586
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

546
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,254
I was trying to stop them.

547
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:31,924
You really believe that

548
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:37,096
people like him will ever change anything?

549
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:43,436
Nothing ever changes.

550
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:50,026
Where is the antivirus?

551
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,528
It's on the train

552
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:55,490
where you found me.

553
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,578
Couldn't have been standing
more than three feet from it.

554
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,664
I so nearly made it out.

555
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:10,922
Didn't realize that bitch of a computer
had defense systems outside the Hive.

556
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:18,596
In or out?

557
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:22,850
I don't know what we had but it's over.

558
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,526
Back..

559
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,238
the fuck off.

560
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:48,793
I'm missing you already.

561
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,596
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

562
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:02,890
He shot the locking mechanism out.

563
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,436
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is gonna get away with this.

564
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,146
<i>I don't think so.</i>

565
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:15,319
<i>I've been a bad, bad girl.</i>

566
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,797
Oh, my God.

567
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,815
What the fuck is that?

568
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,318
<i>One of the Hive's early experiments</i>

569
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:41,656
<i>produced by injecting the T-virus</i>
<i>directly into living tissue.</i>

570
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,450
<i>The results were unstable.</i>

571
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:48,371
<i>Now that it has fed on fresh DNA,</i>
<i>it will mutate..</i>

572
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:59,090
<i>becoming a stronger, faster hunter.</i>

573
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:00,925
Great.

574
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,221
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

575
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,058
'Cause she was saving it for us.

576
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:11,268
Isn't that right?

577
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,689
<i>I didn't think any of you</i>
<i>would make it this far.</i>

578
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,607
<i>Not without infection.</i>

579
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,652
Why didn't you tell us about the antivirus?

580
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:24,407
<i>This long after infection</i>
<i>there's no guarantee it would work.</i>

581
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:29,537
But there's a chance, right?

582
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:31,956
<i>I don't deal in chance.</i>

583
01:18:40,298 --> 01:18:41,549
Fuck it.

584
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,603
No pressure, guys.

585
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,149
<i>You require the four-digit access code.</i>

586
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:02,778
<i>I can give you the code,</i>
<i>but first you must do something for me.</i>

587
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,823
- What do you want?
<i>- One of your group is infected.</i>

588
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,909
<i>I require her life for the code.</i>

589
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:12,037
The antivirus is right
there on the platform.

590
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,248
- It's right there!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

591
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:16,542
<i>It's a risk I cannot take.</i>

592
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,340
She's right. it's the only way.

593
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,760
You're gonna have to kill me.

594
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,223
Otherwise we all die down here.

595
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:42,193
<i>The glass is reinforced</i>
<i>but it won't hold forever.</i>

596
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,115
- Do it.
- No.

597
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,242
- Get up.
- Just do it.

598
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,786
- Rain, please get up.
- Do it!

599
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,497
<i>- You don't have long to decide.</i>
- Get up, please.

600
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,248
- You have no choice.
<i>- Kill her.</i>

601
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,710
<i>Kill her now. You don't have any choice.</i>

602
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,171
- Just do it now!
- I can't!

603
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,548
- Please.
<i>- Do it.</i>

604
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,342
<i>- Kill her.</i>
- Just do it.

605
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:08,052
<i>Kill her now!</i>

606
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:12,056
<i>Kill her!</i>

607
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,422
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

608
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:48,676
Move.

609
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,938
- What the fuck was that?
- It's a long story.

610
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,167
Start it up.

611
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,628
I'll get the virus.

612
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,666
I'm missing you already.

613
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,007
Okay, we're in business.

614
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,635
Full power.

615
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,386
We're leaving!

616
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:34,114
I don't want to be one of those things

617
01:22:36,993 --> 01:22:40,079
walking around without a soul.

618
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:42,831
You won't.

619
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:45,751
When the time comes

620
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:48,921
you'll take care of it.

621
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,634
No one else is gonna die.

622
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:56,470
Okay?

623
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,438
Here.

624
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,504
I'm not dead yet.

625
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,841
I think I'll have that back.

626
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:21,263
I could kiss you, you bitch.

627
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:27,978
What's going on back there?

628
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:43,952
- Get us the fuck out of here!
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails!

629
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:27,139
Open the doors!

630
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:28,432
Now!

631
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:16,456
I failed all of them.

632
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:19,751
I failed.

633
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,422
Listen to me.

634
01:28:23,506 --> 01:28:25,841
There is nothing else you could've done.

635
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:28,802
The corporation's guilty here, not you.

636
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:31,305
And we finally have the proof.

637
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,598
That way Umbrella can't get..

638
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,143
get away with this.

639
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:41,064
What is it?

640
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,861
You're infected, but you're gonna be okay.

641
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:47,946
I'm not losing you.

642
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,164
Help!

643
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,541
Help him. What are you doing?

644
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:13,263
Matt!

645
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,599
<i>He's mutating.</i>

646
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,936
<i>I want him in the Nemesis Program.</i>

647
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,108
Get off!

648
01:29:25,818 --> 01:29:27,611
What's happening?

649
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:34,368
Matt!

650
01:29:53,012 --> 01:29:54,221
<i>I want her quarantined.</i>

651
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:57,599
<i>Close observation</i>
<i>and a full series of blood tests.</i>

652
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:01,728
<i>Let's see if she's infected.</i>

653
01:30:02,271 --> 01:30:04,856
<i>Take her to the Raccoon City facility.</i>

654
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,567
<i>Then assemble the team.</i>

655
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,653
<i>We're reopening the Hive.</i>

656
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,823
<i>I want to know what went on down there.</i>

657
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:15,659
<i>Just do it.</i>

658
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,191
Who's in there?

659
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:35,405
Let me out!

660
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:38,617
Who's in there?

661
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,800
