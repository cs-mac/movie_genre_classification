00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Subtitles By Phaeton

2
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,142
How are you doing, Keaton?

3
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,939
I can't feel my legs...

4
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,776
...Keyser.

5
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,072
Ready?

6
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,418
What time is it?

7
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,045
Twelve thirty.

8
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,149
It all started in New York
six weeks ago.

9
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:16,195
A truck loaded with stripped gun
parts got jacked outside of Queens.

10
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,613
The driver didn't see anybody
but somebody fucked up.

11
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:21,658
He heard a voice.
Sometimes, that's all you need.

12
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,204
Mr. McManus?

13
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:29,457
Christ! Don't you fucking
guys ever sleep?

14
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:30,875
We have a warrant for your arrest.

15
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,418
Fuck you!

16
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:41,760
Todd Hockney?

17
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:43,553
Who wants to know?

18
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,263
New York Police Department.

19
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:50,976
Shit.

20
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,853
Freeze!

21
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,068
Sure you brought enough guys?

22
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:39,729
It's quite simple, really. A restaurant
that changes with the taste...

23
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:42,232
without losing the overall aesthetic.

24
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:46,319
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

25
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,614
Well, let me give you an example...

26
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,615
This I had to see for myself.

27
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,244
David.

28
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,747
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

29
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,375
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

30
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:05,211
Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.

31
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,130
These gentlemen are from the
New York Police Department.

32
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,132
You look good, Keaton.

33
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:11,634
Better that I would have thought.

34
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:13,510
You have a problem, Mr. Keaton?

35
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:17,264
Small matter of a stolen
truck loaded with guns.

36
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,850
Mr. Keaton?

37
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:23,812
Would you excuse us for a moment?

38
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:28,774
We have some questions
to ask you downtown.

39
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,196
No, no, please... sit down.
This is...

40
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,782
This is a small problem.

41
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,492
Enjoy the meal.

42
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,474
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

43
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:07,268
I mean, these guys were hardcore hijackers...

44
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,812
...but there I was.

45
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:14,024
At that point I wasn't scared.

46
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,902
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

47
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,238
Besides, it was fun.

48
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,532
I got to make like I was notorious.

49
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,368
Allright, you all know the drill.

50
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:28,746
When your number is called,
step forward and repeat the phrase...

51
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,039
...you've been given.
Understand?

52
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:31,248
Number 1...

53
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,708
...step forward.

54
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,673
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

55
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:43,843
Number 2, step forward.

56
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:50,349
Gimme the fucking keys, you
fucking cocksucker motherfucker--!

57
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:51,976
Knock it off! Get back!

58
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:53,978
Number 3, step forward.

59
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:04,529
Hand me the keys,
you cocksucker.

60
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,280
In english, please.

61
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:08,074
Excuse me?

62
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:09,825
In english.

63
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:13,245
Hand me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker, what the fuck...

64
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,456
Number 4, step forward.

65
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,709
It was bullshit.
The whole wrap was a set-up.

66
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,711
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

67
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,713
It was all the cops' fault.

68
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:26,299
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

69
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,634
Who knows what can happen.

70
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,805
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

71
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,015
This has really got to be...

72
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:36,725
...embarrassing for you guys.

73
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,060
They drilled us all night.

74
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:41,563
Somebody was pissed about that truck
getting hijacked, and the cops had nothing.

75
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:44,566
They were hoping somebody would
slip up and give them something to go on.

76
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:47,610
They knew we wouldn't fight it
because they knew how to lean on us.

77
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,028
They'd been doing it forever.

78
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:52,907
I mean, our rights went out the window.
It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful.

79
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,158
They went after McManus first.

80
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:55,868
Top-notch entry man.

81
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:57,160
What truck?

82
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,704
The truck with the guns, fucko.

83
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:00,997
Fucko? Brrr...

84
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:06,377
He was a good guy.
Crazy, though.

85
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,379
Wanna know what your
buddy Fenster told us?

86
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,588
Who?

87
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:12,216
McManus. He told us
another story altogether.

88
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:16,011
Oh, that one about the
hooker with dysentery.

89
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,721
Fenster always worked
with McManus.

90
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,764
He was a real tight-ass...

91
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:22,267
...but when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

92
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:23,977
What are you saying?

93
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:25,395
I say he'll flip you.

94
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:27,313
- He what?
- Flip you.

95
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:30,149
- Flip you for real.
- Yeah, I'm shaking. C'mon.

96
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:31,567
Answer my question.

97
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,152
Can you hear me
in the back?

98
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,780
Hello? I want...

99
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,323
...my lawyer.

100
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,117
I'm gonna have your
fucking badge, cocksucker.

101
00:10:41,576 --> 00:10:44,287
Todd Hockney.
Good with explosives.

102
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:48,040
Without a doubt, a one guy who
didn't give a fuck about anybody.

103
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,501
You guys don't have a
fucking leg to stand on.

104
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,961
You think so,
tough guy?

105
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:54,463
I could put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

106
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:55,714
Really?

107
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,549
I live in Queens.

108
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,093
Did you... put that together
yourself, Einstein?

109
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:02,595
What've you got, a team of monkeys
working around the clock on this?

110
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,473
You know what happens if you
do another turn in the joint?

111
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,186
Fuck your father in the shower
and then have a snack.

112
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:12,062
You gonna charge me,
dickhead?

113
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,606
I'll charge you
when I'm ready.

114
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:14,732
With what?

115
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,483
You know damn well,
dead-man.

116
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:20,403
But Keaton... Keaton was the real
prize for them, for obvious reasons.

117
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,947
It was your mistake,
not mine.

118
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:27,952
Did you ever stop to ask me?

119
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:33,582
I mean, I've been working around
with the same face, the same name.

120
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,335
I'm a businessman.

121
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:38,337
Yeah, what's that?
The restaurant business?

122
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:42,507
No, from now on, you're in the
"getting-fucked-by-us" business.

123
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,051
I'm gonna make you
famous, cocksucker.

124
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,552
Like I said...

125
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,055
...it was your mistake.

126
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:50,806
Not mine.

127
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,559
Now you charge me
with this shit...

128
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:55,978
...and I'll beat it.

129
00:11:57,104 --> 00:11:58,772
Ok?

130
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:01,691
Let's get back to that
truck, asshole.

131
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,032
So I did a little time...

132
00:12:10,366 --> 00:12:12,284
...does that mean I get
railed every time...

133
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,620
...a truck finds its way
off the planet?

134
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,038
Fuck them!

135
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,248
Fenster, will you relax?

136
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,542
These guys don't have
any probable cause.

137
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,544
You're fucking A-right. No P.C. ...

138
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,212
No goddamn right.

139
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,130
You do some time,
they never let you go.

140
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,216
You know, treat me
like a criminal...

141
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,676
...I'll end up a criminal.

142
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:32,094
You are a criminal!

143
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,305
Hey, why you gotta
go and do that?

144
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:37,474
I'm trying to make a point.

145
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,434
Oh, why don't you
make your point.

146
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:42,020
You're making me
tired all over.

147
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,771
Oh, fuck it then.

148
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,107
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh yeah?

149
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:47,692
Well, you heard right.

150
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,610
The word I got is you
hung up your spurs, man.

151
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,320
What's that all about?

152
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:52,613
What's this?

153
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:55,240
Rumor has it,
Keaton's gone straight.

154
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,951
I hear he's tapping
Edie Finneran.

155
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,161
Who is that?

156
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,663
She's a heavy-weight
criminal lawyer from uptown.

157
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,498
I hear she's Keaton's
meal ticket.

158
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,458
How 'bout it, Keaton?

159
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,668
You a lawyer's wife?

160
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,421
What kind of "retainer"
you giving her?

161
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,676
Hey, Fenster.
Do your friend a favor...

162
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,303
Tell him to keep quiet.

163
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:20,931
Dean Keaton...

164
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:23,850
...gone clean, huh?

165
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:26,144
Say it ain't so.

166
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:28,229
Was it you that
hit that truck?

167
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:29,689
Forget him.

168
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:31,565
You got to talk
to your lawyer?

169
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:34,902
This whole thing
was a shakedown.

170
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:36,570
What makes you say that?

171
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,447
How many times have
you been to a line-up?

172
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:41,741
It's always you
and four dummies.

173
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:45,245
P.D. are paying homeless guys
ten bucks a head half the time.

174
00:13:45,662 --> 00:13:48,748
And there's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row. No way!

175
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,875
And what's a
voice line-up?

176
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,585
A Public Defender could
get you out of that one.

177
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,420
So why the hell was I
strip-searched?

178
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,171
It was the Feds.

179
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,548
A truckload of guns
gets snagged...

180
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:02,761
...Customs comes down to N.Y.P.D. looking
for answers - they come up with us.

181
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,095
They are clutching
at straws.

182
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,139
Ah, the guys fingered
my asshole tonight.

183
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:07,557
Is it Friday already?

184
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,893
Yeah, lover-boy.

185
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,687
You want a piece?
Something, I love you.

186
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,856
So who in the goddamn place...

187
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,608
...stole the fucking truck?

188
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,152
What did you say?

189
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,903
Who stole the fucking truck!

190
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,446
I don't want to know.

191
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,281
Who asked you,
working man?

192
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,909
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is who's the gimp.

193
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,951
He's ok.

194
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,163
Says you. How do I know that? What
about it, Pretzel-man? What's your story?

195
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,831
His name is Verbal.

196
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,916
Verbal Kint.

197
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:36,959
Verbal?

198
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,754
Roger, really.
People say I talk too much.

199
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:42,797
Yeah, I was just going
to tell you to shut up.

200
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,799
We've met before
once or twice.

201
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,551
In county. I was in for fraud.

202
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,970
You were in the line-up
then, too. What happened?

203
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:51,097
I walked.

204
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:52,139
Ninety days,
suspended.

205
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:53,265
So you did it!

206
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:54,975
All right, now look...

207
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:58,812
We've all been put out by
this whole thing, right?

208
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:02,565
So I figure we owe it to
ourselves to salvage a little dignity

209
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:04,734
Now...

210
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:06,861
...me and Fenster heard
about a little job.

211
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,821
Why don't you just
calm down?

212
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,031
Why do you care
what he has to say?

213
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:13,867
I'm just talking here.

214
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:17,579
And it seems to me like Mr. Hockney
wants to hear what I got to say...

215
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:19,414
...and I know Fenster's down.

216
00:15:20,665 --> 00:15:21,958
What about you guy?

217
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:25,044
I'm interested, sure.

218
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,547
There, see?

219
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,883
So now I'd like to exercise
my right to free assembly.

220
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,968
Why don't you just shut up?

221
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:40,600
You're missing the point.

222
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:45,188
No...
YOU're missing the point.

223
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:48,107
I don't want to hear
anything from you.

224
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,484
I don't care about your job.

225
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:57,908
And... I want nothing
to do with any of you.

226
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,368
I beg your pardon...

227
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:02,120
...but you can all
go to hell.

228
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:05,999
Dean Keaton...

229
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,334
...gone the high road.

230
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,796
What is the world coming to?

231
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,051
Fuck him.

232
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,516
And that was how it started.

233
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:28,728
The five of us being brought in on a trumped-up
charge to be leaned on by half-wits.

234
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,650
Ok, now I really can't talk
about it much here...

235
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,278
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

236
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,781
...was that these men would
never break, never lie down...

237
00:16:42,824 --> 00:16:44,617
...never bend over for anybody...

238
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:47,036
...anybody.

239
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,426
Who are you?

240
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,180
Agent Jack Baer, FBI.
How many dead?

241
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,641
15 so far. They're still pulling some
bodies out of the water, though.

242
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:12,268
Any survivors?

243
00:17:12,476 --> 00:17:13,435
Yeah, there's two.

244
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:16,980
One guy is in county hospital, but he's
in a coma. The D.A. has the second guy...

245
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,316
...a cripple from New York, I think.

246
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,818
Listen, the chief wants
this place sealed off.

247
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:24,070
If you have any questions,
give him a call--

248
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,355
This is Dave Kujan. I'll be in
Los Angeles until tuesday.

249
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,566
If you need to reach me, contact...

250
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:08,152
...Jeff Rabin at the
San Pedro P.D., at extension 112.

251
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:09,487
Have a nice day.

252
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,742
- Why can't I see him?
- Dave, I told you...

253
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:18,829
...the D.A. came down here last night...

254
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,081
...ready to arraign even before
they moved him to county. Ok?

255
00:18:21,373 --> 00:18:23,416
Kint's lawer shows up five minutes later...

256
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,919
...D.A. comes out of the office looking like
the boogey man smacked him around.

257
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:30,131
Allright? They take the statement
and they cut him a deal.

258
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,590
What? Did they charge
him with anything?

259
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,883
Yeah, weapons.

260
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,551
Misdemeanor two.

261
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,928
What is that?

262
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:40,265
Listen, I give the D.A. credit for
getting that much, you understand?

263
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,558
Excuse me.

264
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:45,270
This whole thing
has turned political.

265
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:48,022
The Major was here last night. The chief.
This morning...

266
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,316
...the Governor called, ok?

267
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,653
I'm telling you this guy is protected from
up on high by the prince of darkness.

268
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:55,779
Take my word for it.

269
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:57,197
When does he post bail?

270
00:18:57,406 --> 00:18:58,448
Maybe two hours, tops.

271
00:18:58,657 --> 00:18:59,616
I want to see him.

272
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:01,451
- No, Dave.
- I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

273
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,245
Dave, no!
I can not do this for you.

274
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:05,663
I came a long way for this.

275
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:08,666
Dave, please.

276
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:15,214
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

277
00:19:16,632 --> 00:19:18,467
He's paranoid about
being recorded.

278
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,177
He knows the interrogation
rooms are wired.

279
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,177
This won't be an interrogation...

280
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,347
...just a friendly chat
to kill some time.

281
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,474
He will not go into
the interrogation room.

282
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:28,518
- Just someplace else, then.
- Where?

283
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,647
If this was a dope deal,
where's the dope?

284
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:35,816
If it was a hit,
who called it in?

285
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,861
I'm sure you have a host of wild
theories to answer all these questions.

286
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,738
- You know damn well what I think.
- That's crazy.

287
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:42,906
And besides, it doesn't even matter...

288
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,908
...the guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

289
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,827
He doesn't know what
you want to know.

290
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:50,413
I don't think he does.
Not exactly.

291
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:53,499
But there's a lot more
to his story, believe me.

292
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,336
Jeffrey, look... I want to know why
27 men died on that pier...

293
00:19:57,544 --> 00:20:01,423
...for what looks to be 91 million dollars
worth of dope that wasn't there.

294
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,383
And above all...

295
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,468
...I want to be sure
Dean Keaton is dead.

296
00:20:05,802 --> 00:20:06,928
He's dead.

297
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:08,846
C'mon, two hours.

298
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,389
Just 'till he makes bail.

299
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:12,558
They're all dead.

300
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,727
I don't care how tough a guy
you say this Keaton was...

301
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:17,479
...nobody on that boat
could have come out alive.

302
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:22,025
Is he talking?

303
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:24,944
He regained consciousness
less than an hour ago...

304
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:26,529
...he spoke, not english...
then he lapsed.

305
00:20:26,738 --> 00:20:28,948
- Hungarian?
- I don't know. I think that may have been what it was.

306
00:20:29,156 --> 00:20:30,574
Yeah, most of them
were hungarians.

307
00:20:30,783 --> 00:20:31,534
You've got to put on these.

308
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:34,161
Burn victims are very
succeptible to infections.

309
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,247
And, of course,
there is no smoking.

310
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,842
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

311
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:50,843
Is he gonna die?

312
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:53,762
He has burns over 60% of his body,
a number of his ribs are broken--

313
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,222
Call Hospital Security.

314
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:56,848
Get a man. Put him on the door
until the police get here.

315
00:20:57,057 --> 00:20:58,016
Is he dangerous?

316
00:20:58,433 --> 00:20:59,267
Yes!

317
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:00,519
Do it!

318
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:01,519
Do it now!

319
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,399
Joel?

320
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,192
Yeah, Baer, down
at L.A. County.

321
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:12,071
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

322
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,073
Yes!  Yes, I'm sure.

323
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:17,242
No, no, he's all fucked-up.
What?

324
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,286
I can't hear you.

325
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,247
Shut up! I'm on the phone!

326
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,082
Yes.

327
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:26,709
Well, no. Not--

328
00:21:27,126 --> 00:21:28,836
Just send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

329
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:31,297
Yeah! He's awake and
talking like a Thai hooker.

330
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:33,882
No, just somebody who--

331
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:35,551
What?

332
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:42,974
No shit!

333
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:47,770
Joel. Yeah, call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

334
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,481
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

335
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,223
Verbal, this is Agent
Kujan, from Customs.

336
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,475
Nice to meet you.

337
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,269
He wants to ask you a few
questions before you go.

338
00:22:32,478 --> 00:22:33,646
What about?

339
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,772
About Dean Keaton mostly.

340
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,317
But I'd like to start at the
line-up back in New York.

341
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:40,652
Can I get some coffee?

342
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,946
I a while.
Let's talk about the line-up.

343
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,447
I'm really thirsty.

344
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,574
I used to dehydrate
as a kid.

345
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,701
One time I got so bad,
my piss came out like snot...

346
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,077
...I'm not kidding--

347
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,829
I'll get your fucking coffee.

348
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,622
Get me one too
while you're at it.

349
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,670
That guy is tense.

350
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,422
Tension is a killer.

351
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:05,675
I used to be in a barber shop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

352
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,718
...the bariton was this guy named Kip Diskin.

353
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,804
Big, fat guy.
I mean, like orca-fat.

354
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:11,388
He was so stressed
in the morning--

355
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,599
Verbal, you know we're
trying to help you.

356
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,517
Sure. And I appreciate that.

357
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:17,519
And I want to help
you, Agent Kujan.

358
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:18,854
I like cops.

359
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:21,398
I would have liked to be a
Fed myself, but my C.P. always--

360
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,608
Verbal, you're not
telling us everything.

361
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,485
I know you
know something.

362
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,653
I told the D.A.
everything I know.

363
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:30,614
Verbal...

364
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:34,368
...I know you like Keaton.
I know you think he's a good man.

365
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:36,078
I know he was good.

366
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,579
He was a corrupt cop.

367
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:40,540
Sure, 15 years ago.
But he was a good thief.

368
00:23:41,374 --> 00:23:43,168
Anyway, the cops wouldn't
let him go legit.

369
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,169
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

370
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:51,050
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

371
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:53,552
I just want to hear
your story.

372
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:55,012
It's all there.

373
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,097
May I have a cigarette?

374
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:02,685
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

375
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,984
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

376
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,950
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

377
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,203
Run of the mill scams.

378
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:24,581
That's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

379
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:25,456
Oh, I know.

380
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:28,292
Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

381
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,630
Well, I do have the
weapons charge.

382
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,965
I'm looking at six whole
months hard time.

383
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:37,092
You know a dealer named
Ruby Deemer, Verbal?

384
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,637
You know a religious
guy named John Paul?

385
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,055
You know Ruby is in Attica?

386
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:43,848
He didn't have my lawyer.

387
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:45,058
I know Ruby.
He's big on respect.

388
00:24:45,391 --> 00:24:47,977
He's good friend of mine.
Likes me very much.

389
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,312
Now, I know your
testimony is sealed.

390
00:24:50,646 --> 00:24:52,773
Ruby's well connected.
He's got a lot of friends inside...

391
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:54,108
...do a lot of favors for him.

392
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:58,153
What do you think he would say if he found
out you dropped his name to the D.A.?

393
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,071
There's nothing in
there about Ruby.

394
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,906
I'll be sure to mention
that to him.

395
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:04,909
First thing on the job, you know what I learned?
How to spot a murderer.

396
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,244
Let's say you arrest 3 guys...

397
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:07,620
...for the same killing.

398
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,290
You put them all in jail overnight. The next
morning, whoever is sleeping is your man.

399
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,751
You see, if you're guilty and you know
you're caught, you get some rest...

400
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,961
...you let your guard down.
You follow me?

401
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,004
No.

402
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,005
Let me get right to the point.

403
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:22,425
I'm smarter than you.

404
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:25,511
And I'm gonna find out
what I wanna know.

405
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:27,597
And I'm gonna get it from
you wether you like it or not.

406
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,266
I'm not a rat.

407
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,273
Thanks.

408
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:45,905
Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala,
we used to make fresh coffee.

409
00:25:46,155 --> 00:25:47,698
Right off the trees,
I mean.

410
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:48,783
That was good.

411
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:49,992
This is shit.

412
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:51,118
But, hey,
I'm in a police station--

413
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:52,745
Can we get started again?

414
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,330
Now, what happened
after the line-up?

415
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:04,047
...the Desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell
me that they he couldn't release you.

416
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,049
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged!

417
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:08,759
New York Police!

418
00:26:11,762 --> 00:26:13,931
You know, I want to have
pictures taken of your face...

419
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,016
...take them to the D.A.'s office
first thing tomorrow morning.

420
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:17,059
Just forget about it.

421
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,769
Absolutely not! I'm gonna have this thing
in front of the grand jury by Monday.

422
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,022
Look, I don't want to
talk about it, Edie. Ok?

423
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,818
So what did Fortier
and Renault say?

424
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,612
They asked for some more time
to think about the restaurant.

425
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:31,572
They just want more time! It's ok...

426
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:32,907
More time for what, Edie?

427
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:36,785
No matter how you cover my tracks,
they're still going to find out about me.

428
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:38,662
Give me some credit.

429
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,539
I got you this far.

430
00:26:40,747 --> 00:26:43,291
Let's go to the grand jury.
You know, this isn't going to stop if we--

431
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:45,460
It's never going to stop. Period.

432
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:49,755
By next week, every investor in this city
is going to be walking away from us.

433
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:53,092
It's finished.

434
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,010
I'm finished.

435
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:02,851
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

436
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:06,771
It's never going to stop.

437
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:15,529
I love you.

438
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:18,990
They ruined me in there tonight.

439
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,243
I love you.

440
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:25,246
Do you hear me?

441
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,337
What?

442
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:37,007
All right.

443
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,051
Let's just go to my place.

444
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,442
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

445
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,120
Fenster and McManus had a cagey proposition.

446
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:11,705
A fast jump. High risk.
Long money.

447
00:28:11,914 --> 00:28:13,540
We all knew it could be done.

448
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:16,543
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

449
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,129
To do it right took five men.

450
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:21,006
Five men meant Keaton.

451
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:24,384
Keaton took convincing.

452
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,596
New York finest taxi service.

453
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:30,973
Bullshit!

454
00:28:34,435 --> 00:28:36,145
They don't operate anymore.

455
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:40,774
McManus has a friend in the 14th Precinct.
They're coming out for one job - Thursday.

456
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:43,526
They are picking up a guy smuggling
emeralds out of South America.

457
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,653
McManus already has a fence
set to take the stuff.

458
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:46,696
A fence? Who?

459
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,573
Some guy in California.
His name is Redfoot.

460
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:50,074
I never heard of him.

461
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:51,617
You have to come.

462
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,244
What's it to you
wether I do it not?

463
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:56,330
They--
They don't know me. You do.

464
00:28:56,622 --> 00:28:58,665
They won't take me
unless you go.

465
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:00,917
Look at me.
I need this.

466
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,920
Oh, are you telling me
you don't need this?

467
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,505
Is this your place?

468
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:09,133
I'm not knocking you, you look like you've got
a good little scam going on with this lawyer--

469
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:15,013
Sorry.

470
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:17,891
It's ok.

471
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,394
You say it's the real thing?
That's cool.

472
00:29:24,564 --> 00:29:25,523
You're ok?

473
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,567
I was out of line.

474
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,903
But they're never going to stop
with us, you know that.

475
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:34,114
As clean as you could ever get,
they'll never let you go now.

476
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:37,826
This way we hit the cops where it
hurts and we get well in the mean time.

477
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,706
You sure you're ok?

478
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,708
I'll be all right.

479
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:01,723
Look, I...

480
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:04,475
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

481
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:10,398
I probably shit blood tonight.

482
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:27,246
So, how do they want to do it?

483
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:31,667
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

484
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,379
Fenster?
Hockney?

485
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:38,048
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

486
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:41,676
Now, I've got a way of doing
it without killing anyone.

487
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,803
But, as I said, they won't
let me in without you.

488
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,696
Three million?

489
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,116
Maybe more.

490
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:12,955
No killing.

491
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,291
Not if we do it my way.

492
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:53,701
New York's finest taxi service was
not your normal taxi service.

493
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:57,996
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the
N.Y.P.D. that ran a high-profit racket...

494
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,373
...driving smugglers and drug
dealers all over the city.

495
00:32:00,582 --> 00:32:03,126
For a few hundred dollars a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

496
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:03,960
...and a police escort.

497
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,170
They even had their
own business cards.

498
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:07,630
After a while, somebody
started asking...

499
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:10,466
...questions and the
taxi service shut down.

500
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:14,178
Ever since then, Internal Affairs had been
waiting to catch them in the act.

501
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:16,096
And that's where we came in.

502
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:17,597
So, how was the flight?

503
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,141
Fucking great.

504
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,103
Will this get me to Staten Island?

505
00:32:24,646 --> 00:32:26,939
Kidding me? This will
get you to Cape Cod.

506
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:30,234
McManus came to us with the job,
Fenster got the vans...

507
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:31,861
...Hockney supplied the hardware.

508
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:34,405
I came through with how
to do it so no-one got killed.

509
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:35,823
But Keaton...

510
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,241
Keaton put on
the finishing touch.

511
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,203
A little "fuck you" from the
five of us to the N.Y.P.D. .

512
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:46,666
All right, watch this.

513
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:48,793
Careful!

514
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:49,877
Asshole!

515
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,674
Don't move, you fucker!

516
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:57,467
- Who the--
- Drop it! Now, motherfucker!

517
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,970
Drop the fucking gun!

518
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:01,888
Don't you fucking touch
those fucking things!

519
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,723
What the fuck d'you guys want?

520
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,392
Stupid asshole!

521
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:08,102
Watch it!

522
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:12,106
You want a buckshot shampoo, Chubby?

523
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:20,739
Afternoon, my little pork-chops.

524
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:22,240
Now gimme the shit.

525
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:23,783
Give him the fucking shit!

526
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:24,909
Give him the fucking shit!

527
00:33:27,745 --> 00:33:28,746
Hurry up!

528
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:29,997
C'mon!

529
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:30,998
Now the money!

530
00:33:31,248 --> 00:33:33,083
- There's no money!
- Gimme the money! Right now!

531
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,460
- There's no fucking money!

532
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,919
Give him the money!

533
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:36,879
The money!

534
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,172
Give me the fucking money!

535
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,382
Do it!

536
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:41,925
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

537
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,763
Do you peolpe know
who the fuck I am?

538
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:50,391
We do now, jerk-off.

539
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:00,150
What's that?

540
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,902
What the fuck--?

541
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,988
Holy shit!

542
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,505
Keaton made an
anonymous phone call...

543
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,923
...the press was on the scene
before the police were.

544
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,509
Strausz and Rizzi were
indicted three days later.

545
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:31,011
Within a few weeks, 50 more
cops went down with them.

546
00:34:31,846 --> 00:34:34,598
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

547
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:36,683
It was beautiful.

548
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,734
I owe you $2.50 .

549
00:34:52,448 --> 00:34:53,991
There's more here than I thought.

550
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:55,617
When does the fence come?

551
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:58,995
Redfoot never comes to see me,
I always go to see him.

552
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:01,665
In California?

553
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,376
Yes, Verbal, in California.
Fenster and I will--

554
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,628
Wait, wait...
Hold the fucking phone...

555
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,046
...you and Fenster?
No, no, no...

556
00:35:10,631 --> 00:35:11,715
You fuckin' kiddin' me?

557
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:13,008
Ok. So...

558
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,510
...who's gonna go?

559
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:16,178
We all go!

560
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,473
What's your fucking
problem, man?

561
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:24,185
My fucking problem, man, is that you and
Fenster are off honeymooning in California...

562
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:25,603
...while the rest of us are
sitting here holding our dicks.

563
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,731
Hey! The job's over.

564
00:35:29,398 --> 00:35:30,441
Cool it.

565
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,861
L.A. is a good place
to lay low for a while.

566
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:38,073
Wanna dance?

567
00:35:45,747 --> 00:35:46,748
Ladies...

568
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:56,673
I would like to propose a toast...

569
00:35:58,258 --> 00:35:59,259
There you go.

570
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:03,596
...to Mr. Verbal...

571
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,058
...the man with the plan.

572
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,155
We're gonna miss the flight.

573
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,783
Don't do this.
Send her a note - something.

574
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,578
I said we'll make it.

575
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:04,569
We're gonna miss the plane.

576
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:07,864
She'll understand.

577
00:37:27,507 --> 00:37:29,050
That's heartwarming.

578
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:30,384
Really.

579
00:37:32,136 --> 00:37:33,262
I'm weepy.

580
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,223
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

581
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:42,854
You guys wanted to know what happened
after the line-up. I'm telling you.

582
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:44,272
Come on, Verbal.

583
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,357
Who do you think
you're talking to?

584
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,527
You expect me to believe
that he retired?

585
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:51,695
For a woman?

586
00:37:53,906 --> 00:37:54,865
Bullshit!

587
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,700
Keaton was using her.

588
00:37:56,992 --> 00:37:58,118
He loved her.

589
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,161
Sure.

590
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,580
I'm supposed to believe that hitting the
taxi service wasn't his idea either?

591
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:04,374
It was all Fenster and McManus.

592
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,459
C'mon, Keaton was
a cop for 4 years!

593
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,837
Who else would know the taxi service better?
That job had his name written all over it.

594
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,464
But Edie had him
all turned around.

595
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,465
Let me tell you something.

596
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,008
I know Dean Keaton.

597
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:18,053
I've been investigating him
for the past 3 years.

598
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:20,764
The guy I know was a
cold-blooded bastard.

599
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:25,310
I.A.D. indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force.

600
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:27,603
So don't sell me the hooker
with the heart of gold.

601
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:29,522
You got him all wrong.

602
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:31,649
Do I?

603
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:36,653
Dean Keaton was under indictment a total
of 7 times while he was on the force.

604
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:40,365
In every case the witnesses either
reversed their testimony to the grand jury...

605
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,118
...or died before they could testify.

606
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:48,331
When they finally nailed him for fraud
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

607
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,541
He killed three
prisioners inside.

608
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,544
Of course
I can't prove this.

609
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,713
But I can't prove
the best part either:

610
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,383
Dean Keaton was dead.

611
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:02,510
Did you know that?

612
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:04,846
He died in a fire
two years ago...

613
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,306
...during an investigation into
the murder of a witness...

614
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,684
...who was going to
testify against him.

615
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:12,895
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

616
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,772
...just before it blew up.

617
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,983
They said he went in to
check a leaking gas main.

618
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:22,487
It blew up, and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

619
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,865
Within three months
of the explosion...

620
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,992
...the two witnesses,
they were dead.

621
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:30,703
One killed himself in his car...

622
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,789
...the other fell down an
open elevator shaft.

623
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,710
Agent Baer.

624
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,837
This is not what we discussed.
There are far too many people in this room--

625
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,340
Look, doctor, I promise we'll be out of
here before he blows his porcelain. Ok?

626
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,009
I have a noon meeting, Baer.

627
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,970
- Agent Baer, five minutes.
- Look, everyone just calm down. All right?

628
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,556
I want you to ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbor.

629
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:05,360
He says they were buying--

630
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,820
Dope, we know.

631
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,204
He doesn't know what they
were buying, but not dope... people.

632
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:18,372
What?

633
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,130
He needs guarantees...

634
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,298
What is he talking about?

635
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,550
He says his life's in danger.

636
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:36,388
He saw the devil.
Looked him in the eye.

637
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:39,057
- I'm on my way.
- No, no. Wait a minute.

638
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:42,143
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

639
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:44,062
About the devil.

640
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:46,189
Who's the devil.

641
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,279
Keyser Soze.

642
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:00,368
He was in the harbor...

643
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:02,746
...killing many men.

644
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:04,956
He saw Keyser Soze?

645
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:12,796
He saw his face.

646
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:16,675
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

647
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,427
Describe him.

648
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:28,519
Six weeks ago I get an anonymous
phone call telling me...

649
00:41:28,728 --> 00:41:31,647
...I could find Keaton eating at Mondino's
with his attourney. And there he is.

650
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:35,359
Now, because he never
profited from his alleged death...

651
00:41:35,609 --> 00:41:38,987
...and because we convicted someone
else of the murder we tried to pin on him...

652
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:40,864
...we had to let him go.

653
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:44,909
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

654
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:46,828
And then he had lunch.

655
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,621
I don't know about that.

656
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:50,539
Oh, I don't think you do.

657
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:54,668
But you say you saw Keaton die.
I think you're covering his ass...

658
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,753
...and he's still out there somewhere.

659
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:58,964
I think he's behind that
whole circus at the harbor.

660
00:41:59,172 --> 00:42:02,592
My bet is he's using you because your're
stupid and you think he's your friend.

661
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:05,136
You tell me he's dead?
So be it.

662
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,181
I want to be sure he's dead
before I go back to New York.

663
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,016
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

664
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:13,102
What lawyer.

665
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:14,978
What lawyer, Verbal?

666
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,981
You know, back when I was with that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois, I--

667
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:20,483
You don't think I know
you held out on the D.A.?

668
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:22,277
What did you leave
out on that testimony?

669
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:24,279
I can be on the phone to
Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.

670
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:26,114
The D.A. gave me immunity.

671
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:29,742
Not from me. You get no immunity
from me, you piece of shit.

672
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:33,245
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

673
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:37,499
...every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

674
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:38,667
Now you talk to me...

675
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,378
...or that precious immunity they
seem so fit to grant you...

676
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:44,881
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

677
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:49,802
There was a lawyer.

678
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:52,638
Kobayashi.

679
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:55,099
Is he the one that killed Keaton?

680
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:58,310
No.
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

681
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:00,604
Convince me.

682
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,022
Tell me every last detail.

683
00:43:22,332 --> 00:43:26,127
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' friends, Redfoot.

684
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:28,379
He had a good reputation.

685
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:30,381
Seemed like a good guy.

686
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:32,383
Still, we should have known better.

687
00:43:32,591 --> 00:43:33,384
How're you doing?

688
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:36,803
- Good. You?
- Not bad.

689
00:43:37,596 --> 00:43:38,972
- How's it going, Fenster?

690
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:42,100
No need to open it, right?

691
00:43:48,397 --> 00:43:49,982
You must be Keaton.

692
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:52,860
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

693
00:43:53,193 --> 00:43:54,570
Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.

694
00:43:54,778 --> 00:43:57,197
Verbal. The man with the plan, huh?

695
00:43:57,906 --> 00:43:59,449
You guys interested
in any more work?

696
00:44:00,659 --> 00:44:02,035
We're always looking
for extra work.

697
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:03,578
We're on vacation.

698
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:06,581
Oh well... that's too bad.

699
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,958
I have a ton of work and I
don't have any good people.

700
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,252
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job.

701
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:14,463
There's this jeweler out
of Texas named Saul.

702
00:44:14,671 --> 00:44:16,673
He rents a suite in some
downtown hotel...

703
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,385
...does free appraisals for people.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

704
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:23,263
Anyway, the word is he
carries around a lot of cash.

705
00:44:24,138 --> 00:44:28,059
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

706
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:30,853
- It's simple.
- What about security?

707
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:32,396
A couple of bodyguards.

708
00:44:32,688 --> 00:44:34,231
Nothing you couldn't handle.

709
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,316
Give me time to check it out.

710
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:38,735
I'd expect nothing less
from you, man.

711
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,405
- Good to see you. We'll call you.
- Good to see you too.

712
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:45,199
Enjoy L.A., huh?
Get yourself laid.

713
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:54,041
A friend of mine in New York tells
me that you know Spook Hollis.

714
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,752
The way I hear it...

715
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,086
...you did time with old Spook.

716
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,172
Good man, wasn't he?

717
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,298
I used to run dope for him.

718
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:05,009
Too bad he got shivved.

719
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:08,513
Yeah. I shivved him.

720
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:14,309
Better you hear it from me now
than somebody else later.

721
00:45:16,145 --> 00:45:17,938
I appreciate that.

722
00:45:19,272 --> 00:45:20,607
Just out of curiosity...

723
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:24,360
...was it business or personal?

724
00:45:26,237 --> 00:45:27,196
A bit of both.

725
00:45:29,365 --> 00:45:33,244
Well, like I said, you give me
a call if you're interested.

726
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:40,041
Is there a problem?

727
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,879
One job. That was the deal.

728
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:51,969
One job?

729
00:45:54,722 --> 00:45:56,265
One job!

730
00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,518
That's a good one, Keaton.

731
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:05,481
Keaton followed the best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

732
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,609
He can convince anyone he's
someone else, but never himself.

733
00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:12,279
It took one day with McManus nagging
and we went back to work.

734
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,689
Give me the case!
Give me the fucking case!

735
00:46:56,403 --> 00:46:57,613
Give me the fucking case!

736
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,698
I'm telling you for the last time...

737
00:47:00,073 --> 00:47:01,658
...give me the fucking case!

738
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:45,907
Now just hand over the case.

739
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,910
Hand over the fucking case!

740
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,061
Bad day. Fuck it.

741
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:51,133
Looks like a lot of China to me.
Shit.

742
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,307
Guys, c'mon.

743
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:03,019
- What are you doing?
- What does it look that I'm doing. I'm gonna kill him.

744
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:05,021
Look, we did it your way.
Now we're gonna do it my way.

745
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:07,148
- Are you gonna kill him?
- I'm going to deal with him.

746
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,358
You better deal with him--

747
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:10,568
Shut up.

748
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,867
What I am supposed to do with that?

749
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:22,078
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp.

750
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,913
Eases pain. I don't know what that is.

751
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:25,790
- What do you mean you don' know?
- Shut up.

752
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:27,875
I don't know. I got thrown
this job by some lawyer.

753
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:28,960
Yeah, who?

754
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:31,420
I don't know. Some Limey.

755
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:34,340
He's a middle man for somebody.
He doesn't say. I don't ask.

756
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:36,383
- You're fucking full of shit.
- Fuck you!

757
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:40,512
Listen to me. We want to meet him, ok?

758
00:49:42,097 --> 00:49:43,473
That's funny. Called me last night...

759
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,601
...he says he wants to meet you guys.

760
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:50,479
Ok. We'll meet him.

761
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,439
- I'll call you.
- Good. Do that. No problem.

762
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:53,941
I don't like the deal.

763
00:49:54,149 --> 00:49:56,109
One more thing, tough guy.

764
00:49:56,777 --> 00:49:59,071
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

765
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:04,534
You're such a top guy McManus.
But do me a favor, right?

766
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,202
Get the fuck off my dick!

767
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:10,873
Put a leash on that puppy.

768
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:16,545
It's an awful shame about
Saul getting waxed.

769
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:19,047
Cops are gonna be looking
for the guys who did it.

770
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:22,717
Sooner or later they're
gonna come 'round asking me.

771
00:50:25,303 --> 00:50:27,263
You have a sweet night, ladies.

772
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:41,693
- So this lawyer...
- Kobayashi.

773
00:50:42,444 --> 00:50:44,654
- ...came from Redfoot.
- Right.

774
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:47,532
And why leave this out
when you talked to the D.A.?

775
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,825
Dave. Someone to see you.

776
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:57,207
Jack. I've been looking all over for you.

777
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:01,211
You still after that coke that took a walk out
of that blood bath in the harbor yesterday?

778
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:04,255
- Yeah.
- Well, you can stop looking. It was no coke.

779
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:07,675
I've been in L.A. county talking
to a guy they pulled out...

780
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:09,760
...of a drainpipe in San Pedro
yesterday after the shoot-out.

781
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:11,804
He came to this morning.
He started talking.

782
00:51:12,012 --> 00:51:15,766
He was part of a Hungarian mob there to do
a deal with a bunch of goats from Argentina...

783
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:17,726
...and he says it was
definitely not a dope deal.

784
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:18,894
- But the 91 mill--
- Yeah, we know.

785
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,271
Our man says
no way on the dope.

786
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:24,941
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch
was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

787
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:28,653
They had no time to negotiate that kind
of product and no means to move it.

788
00:51:28,861 --> 00:51:30,696
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

789
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:33,741
No one doing the deal knew,
except for a few key people.

790
00:51:33,949 --> 00:51:36,410
They all were very hush
about it, he says.

791
00:51:36,618 --> 00:51:39,037
Whatever it was,
it's very sensitive.

792
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,413
I don't get it.

793
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:45,168
They tell me you got that cripple there
from New York. Did he mention Keyser Soze?

794
00:51:45,543 --> 00:51:46,377
Who?

795
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,796
Just bear with me here.

796
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:51,632
Who's Keyser Soze?

797
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:53,050
Oh, fuck!

798
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:57,429
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

799
00:51:57,888 --> 00:52:01,516
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

800
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:03,476
What we need to do is think.

801
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:05,395
Think back.

802
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:07,814
Somebody...

803
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:09,523
...with power.

804
00:52:09,774 --> 00:52:12,735
Somebody who was capable of tracking
us from New York to Los Angeles.

805
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:14,611
Come on, Dean. What the
hell are we doing here?

806
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,155
We're waiting.

807
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,782
- Bye now.
- Sit down.

808
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,408
- No, I'm fucking bored--

809
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:24,329
- Mr. Hockney, do stay. Mr. Keaton...

810
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:29,041
...Mr. Fenster I recognize from his
mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

811
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:34,129
I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

812
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:38,383
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

813
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:40,927
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

814
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:44,389
I have been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal...

815
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:45,765
...to you gentlemen.

816
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:48,935
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services gentlemen.

817
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:54,732
One job. One day's work. Very dangerous.

818
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,235
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

819
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:01,363
...will have 91 million dollars
to divide between you...

820
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,448
- ...in any way you see fit.
- Who's your boss?

821
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,119
- I work for Keyser Soze.

822
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:21,840
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Judging by the sudden change in mood, Mr. Kint...

823
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,468
...I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you.

824
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:29,472
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

825
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,140
An order, actually.

826
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:33,267
What do you mean, an order?

827
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:35,144
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,...

828
00:53:35,352 --> 00:53:38,855
...you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

829
00:53:39,147 --> 00:53:42,692
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

830
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,779
...and which was destined for Pakistan,
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

831
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:50,241
A most profitable violation
of U.N. regulations.

832
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:52,243
You had no way of
knowing this, Mr. Keaton...

833
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,496
...because the fellow shipping the
steel was working for Mr. Soze...

834
00:53:55,788 --> 00:53:57,414
...without his knowledge.

835
00:53:57,623 --> 00:53:59,124
Earlier this year...

836
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:04,087
...Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport.

837
00:54:04,295 --> 00:54:08,508
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring. Also set for Pakistan.

838
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:13,262
Two months ago, Mr. Hockney
stole a truck carrying gun parts...

839
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,388
...through Queens...

840
00:54:15,973 --> 00:54:18,975
...gun parts which where set to be
destroyed by the State of New York.

841
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:22,854
They would be "lost" in a weigh
station and rerouted to Belfast.

842
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:25,940
Again, Mr. Soze, using pawns
who had no knowledge.

1
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:29,378
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

2
00:54:30,337 --> 00:54:31,338
Nine months ago...

3
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,424
...one of Mr. Soze's
less-than-intelligent couriers...

4
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:39,054
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scan...by a cripple.

5
00:54:40,096 --> 00:54:42,974
He was relieved of 62,000 dollars.

6
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:46,352
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

7
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,189
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

8
00:54:50,606 --> 00:54:52,483
You set up the line-up...

9
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:55,068
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

10
00:54:55,277 --> 00:54:58,154
It seems Mr. Keatons
attourney, Ms. Finneran...

11
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,490
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

12
00:55:00,782 --> 00:55:04,285
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

13
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,413
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

14
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:09,999
Mr. Soze rarely works
with the same people...

15
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,042
...for very long, and they
never know who they're working for.

16
00:55:13,168 --> 00:55:16,463
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

17
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:19,257
So... why telling us?

18
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:23,428
Because you have stolen
from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster.

19
00:55:23,845 --> 00:55:24,470
All of you.

20
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:26,764
That you did not know
you stole from him...

21
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:29,058
...is the only reason
you're still alive.

22
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:32,895
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

23
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:35,314
All right, fuck the debt!
And fuck you!

24
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:37,107
How do we know
you work for Soze?

25
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:40,360
I don't think that is very
relevant, Mr. Hockney.

26
00:55:40,568 --> 00:55:45,072
All five of you are responsible for the
murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

27
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:49,618
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement,
and we can see to it that he will.

28
00:55:49,827 --> 00:55:52,913
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen.

29
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:55,499
Mr. Soze's primary interest...

30
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,250
...is narcotics.

31
00:55:57,459 --> 00:56:00,086
He has been "competing", shall we say,
with a group of Argentinians...

32
00:56:00,378 --> 00:56:02,672
...for several years now.

33
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,925
Competing with Mr. Soze
has taken its toll.

34
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:09,803
These Argentinians are
negotiating the sale...

35
00:56:10,095 --> 00:56:13,015
...of 91 million dollars in
cocaine in 3 days time.

36
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:16,101
Needless to say, this
purchase will revitalize...

37
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:19,145
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

38
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:23,274
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

39
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,986
If you choose, you may
wait until after the buy.

40
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:29,530
Whatever money changes hands
is yours.

41
00:56:30,656 --> 00:56:35,369
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

42
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,415
And then you will be free of
your obligations to Mr. Soze.

43
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:46,170
You give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

44
00:56:47,755 --> 00:56:48,714
A gift...

45
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:50,674
...from Mr. Soze.

46
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,429
Good day, gentlemen.

47
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:07,912
They've got my whole life in here!
Everything I've ever done since I was 18!

48
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:09,788
They fucking know everything!

49
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:12,708
Everybody I've ever worked
with or did time with.

50
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:33,101
- No... this isn't right.
- I don't know.

51
00:58:33,393 --> 00:58:35,937
Who was that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

52
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:39,399
Bricks Marlin.

53
00:58:39,607 --> 00:58:42,485
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

54
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:45,905
He said he always made 5 times
more money than the job was worth.

55
00:58:47,365 --> 00:58:51,285
This guy's a pipe dream.
Kobayashi is using him for window dressing.

56
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,453
I don't know.
This is bad.

57
00:58:53,996 --> 00:58:57,749
That's bullshit! This guy could be L.A.P.D. ...
It's a fucking setup!

58
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:01,544
Ah, the way I hear it, Soze...
is some kind of butcher.

59
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,130
A fearless psycho...
fucked up butcher.

60
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:06,132
There is no Keyser Soze!

61
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:09,844
Who is Keyser Soze?

62
00:59:11,595 --> 00:59:14,890
He's supposed to be turkish.
Some say his father was german.

63
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:17,601
Nobody ever believed
he was real.

64
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:20,854
Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him...

65
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:23,898
...but to hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

66
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:26,651
You never knew.
That was his power.

67
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:31,155
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

68
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,283
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

69
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,453
One story the guys told me
-the story I believe- ...

70
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,330
...was from his days in Turkey.

71
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:43,166
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

72
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:44,959
They realized that to be in power...

73
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:48,212
...you didn't need guns,
or money, or even numbers.

74
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:52,049
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

75
00:59:52,299 --> 00:59:55,469
After a while, they come into power
and then they come after Soze.

76
00:59:55,677 --> 00:59:58,513
He was small time then,
just running dope they say.

77
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,684
They come to his home...

78
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,102
...in the afternoon...

79
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:05,728
...looking for his business.

80
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,313
They find his wife and
kids in the house...

81
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:09,356
...and decide to
wait for Soze.

82
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:27,123
He comes home...

83
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:30,125
...to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

84
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,587
The Hungarians knew Soze was
tough. Not to be trifled with.

85
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,297
So they let him know
they meant business.

86
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,263
They tell him they want his territory.
All of his business.

87
01:00:44,722 --> 01:00:48,392
Soze looks over the
faces of his family...

88
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:53,772
...then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

89
01:01:13,165 --> 01:01:16,334
He tells him he would
rather see his family dead...

90
01:01:16,752 --> 01:01:19,087
...than live another
day after this.

91
01:01:19,504 --> 01:01:22,382
He lets the last Hungarian go.

92
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:26,594
He waits until his wife and kids are in the ground
and then he goes after the rest of the mob.

93
01:01:27,053 --> 01:01:30,264
He kills their kids. He kills their wives.
He kills their parents...

94
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:32,015
...and their parents friends.

95
01:01:32,724 --> 01:01:34,810
He burns down the
houses they live in...

96
01:01:35,977 --> 01:01:37,395
...and the stores
they work in.

97
01:01:38,146 --> 01:01:41,524
He kills people that owe them
money. And like that...

98
01:01:43,026 --> 01:01:44,861
...he's gone.
Underground.

99
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,488
Nobody has ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

100
01:01:47,697 --> 01:01:50,699
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

101
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:53,952
"Rat on your pop
and Keyser Soze will get you."

102
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,913
No one ever really believes.

103
01:01:57,873 --> 01:01:58,873
Do you believe
in him, Verbal?

104
01:02:01,709 --> 01:02:03,503
Keaton always said:

105
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:06,964
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

106
01:02:09,049 --> 01:02:11,176
Well, I believe in God.

107
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:15,263
And the only thing that
scares me is Keyser Soze.

108
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,355
You give any weight to this?

109
01:02:24,605 --> 01:02:26,774
I can introduce you to
Dan Metzheiser from Justice.

110
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:30,653
He's got a file on Soze in D.C. .
I'ts been a hobby of his for a couple of years.

111
01:02:30,861 --> 01:02:34,072
A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on the Incredible Hulk.

112
01:02:39,452 --> 01:02:42,080
- You've heard of him?
- What, on the street?

113
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:44,999
A few times.
Outside stuff.

114
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:47,710
Somebody working for a guy
who works for a guy...

115
01:02:47,918 --> 01:02:50,671
...who got some money from Keyser Soze.
Y'know, shit like that.

116
01:02:51,755 --> 01:02:53,215
Could be an old badge.

117
01:02:53,423 --> 01:02:55,092
A hex sign to keep people
from fucking with you...

118
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,219
...back when a name
was to mean something.

119
01:02:57,427 --> 01:02:58,553
But you're here.

120
01:02:58,762 --> 01:02:59,596
Shit, yeah.

121
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:02,390
I got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on a fried drumstick...

122
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:03,641
...because he's afraid of Soze.

123
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:06,310
I'll run up the flagpole.

124
01:03:08,229 --> 01:03:10,314
I came clean. I told it like it
happened on the boat.

125
01:03:10,522 --> 01:03:12,107
So what if I left out
how I got there?

126
01:03:12,357 --> 01:03:15,360
It's so full of holes, the D.A. would have
told me to blow amnesty up my ass.

127
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:17,612
So you got what you wanted
out of me, so big fucking deal.

128
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:19,030
So that's why you
never told the D.A. .

129
01:03:19,322 --> 01:03:22,325
Well, you tell me, Agent Kujan...
if I told you the Loch Ness monster...

130
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:24,160
hired me to hit the harbor,
what would you say?

131
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,829
Turn state's evidence. We'll put you
on the stand, we'll hear it out.

132
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:29,081
I've got immunity now.
What can you possibly offer me?

133
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,875
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come looking for you.

134
01:03:33,335 --> 01:03:34,753
Where's your head,
Agent Kujan?

135
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:36,797
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

136
01:03:37,005 --> 01:03:38,632
Keyser Soze, or whatever
you want to call him...

137
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,258
...he knows where
I am right now.

138
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,427
He's got the front burner
under your ass to let me go...

139
01:03:42,635 --> 01:03:44,387
...so he can scoop me up
10 minutes later.

140
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:46,389
Immunity was just a
deal with you assholes.

141
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:48,265
I've got a whole new
problem when I post bail.

142
01:03:48,641 --> 01:03:50,476
So why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

143
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:52,936
Oh, gee, thanks Dave. Bang-up job so far...

144
01:03:53,145 --> 01:03:55,647
...extortion,
coersion...

145
01:03:55,981 --> 01:03:57,732
...you probably pardon me
if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

146
01:03:57,983 --> 01:03:59,734
The same fuckers that rounded
this up and sank us into this mess...

147
01:03:59,943 --> 01:04:01,027
...are now bailing me out?

148
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:02,153
Fuck you!

149
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:07,366
You think you can
catch Keyser Soze?

150
01:04:07,616 --> 01:04:10,327
You think a guy like that comes
this close to getting caught...

151
01:04:10,536 --> 01:04:11,704
...and sticks his head out?

152
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:15,082
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

153
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,124
And after that...

154
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:20,086
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

155
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:43,941
What happened next?

156
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:46,777
We woke up next morning
and Fenster was gone.

157
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:49,697
He couldn't handle the
idea of slumming for Soze.

158
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:51,740
He left us a note
wishing us good luck...

159
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:54,076
...and took a chunk of the
money we'd scraped together.

160
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:55,994
Then what?

161
01:04:56,244 --> 01:04:57,412
McManus was furious.

162
01:04:57,621 --> 01:04:59,581
He was talking about tracking him
down and ripping his heart out...

163
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:01,291
...and all sorts of shit.

164
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:04,419
That night we got the call.

165
01:05:05,128 --> 01:05:06,295
What call?

166
01:05:06,504 --> 01:05:08,923
Kobayashi told us
where we could find Fenster.

167
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,723
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

168
01:05:20,975 --> 01:05:22,477
We've got to bury him.

169
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,062
With what?

170
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,980
With our hands.

171
01:05:35,906 --> 01:05:37,449
Oh, this is nuts!

172
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:40,535
It's dry fucking sand,
McManus. When he rots...

173
01:05:40,743 --> 01:05:42,996
...the surfers are gonna
smell him a mile away.

174
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:44,205
Dig, you fucker!

175
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:47,083
Hey, what are we going to do?
This fucking guy is gonna kill us.

176
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,834
I don't know you,
peg-leg, but I can run.

177
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:51,128
I got no problem with that.

178
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:55,007
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with that either.

179
01:05:56,258 --> 01:05:59,969
You run? I won't be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

180
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:04,557
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

181
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:06,726
Fuck you!

182
01:06:06,934 --> 01:06:08,978
He was my partner
for 5 years.

183
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:12,648
We did more jobs, and I saw more
money, than you can ever count.

184
01:06:12,856 --> 01:06:16,068
So fuck you!
'Cause now it's payback!

185
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:18,111
It's not payback.

186
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:24,075
It's precaution. You want payback?
You wanna run? I don't care.

187
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:30,914
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

188
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:33,375
I'm not doing it for you.

189
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:36,837
I'm doing this for me.

190
01:06:38,797 --> 01:06:40,715
I'm going to finish this thing.

191
01:06:41,341 --> 01:06:44,635
This Kobayashi bastard
is not going to stand on me.

192
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:07,823
And after they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

193
01:07:08,032 --> 01:07:10,284
I wanted to. I thought
we could make it.

194
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:11,952
Why didn't you say anything?

195
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,580
Believe me, I tried.
But Keaton wouldn't have it.

196
01:07:14,788 --> 01:07:16,456
It was too far-fetched for him.

197
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,042
Keaton was a grounded guy,
an ex-cop.

198
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:23,338
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

199
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:26,591
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

200
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,467
If you got a dead body
and you think his brother did it...

201
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:30,010
...you're going to find out you're right.

202
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:33,597
Nobody argued with Keaton.
They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.

203
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:45,650
They're coming up.

204
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,612
You hear me?
He's coming up.

205
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:51,363
He's on his way down.

206
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:49,375
Don't move.

207
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,086
Press twenty.
Do it now.

208
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,438
Move.

209
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:18,193
The answer is no.

210
01:09:18,902 --> 01:09:19,986
Mr. Soze will be most up--

211
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:22,322
Listen, you cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

212
01:09:22,530 --> 01:09:24,198
You mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

213
01:09:24,449 --> 01:09:28,202
Strange threat, Mr. Keaton. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

214
01:09:34,124 --> 01:09:36,793
We know that you
can get to us.

215
01:09:37,502 --> 01:09:39,879
But now you know
that we can get to you.

216
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,549
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

217
01:09:43,758 --> 01:09:45,009
Mr. So--

218
01:09:45,384 --> 01:09:48,637
My employer has made up
his mind. He does not change it.

219
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:49,763
Neither do we.

220
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:53,433
You got Fenster.
But you won't get all of us.

221
01:09:53,725 --> 01:09:55,602
Not before one of us
gets through to you.

222
01:09:55,811 --> 01:09:59,064
I believe you, Mr. McManus.
I most sincerely do.

223
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:02,609
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

224
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,819
But I cannot make
this decision.

225
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:07,613
Whatever you threaten
me with is... ludicrous...

226
01:10:07,863 --> 01:10:11,992
...in comparsion to what will be done to me
if I do not carry out my orders in full.

227
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,126
I'm the guy that's
going to get you.

228
01:10:24,128 --> 01:10:26,339
I just wanted you
to know that.

229
01:10:27,298 --> 01:10:29,425
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

230
01:10:29,717 --> 01:10:32,177
I implore you, Mr. Keaton,
believe me.

231
01:10:32,678 --> 01:10:36,098
Mr. Soze is very real
and very determined.

232
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:37,516
We'll see.

233
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:48,317
Before you...
...do me in, Mr. McManus...

234
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,736
...you'll let me finish
my business...

235
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:52,529
...with Ms. Finneran first,
won't you?

236
01:10:57,701 --> 01:10:59,160
What did you say?

237
01:11:00,286 --> 01:11:03,998
Edie Finneran.
She's upstairs in my office.

238
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,543
For an extradition deposition.

239
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:10,671
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

240
01:11:10,921 --> 01:11:12,714
She flew in yesterday.

241
01:11:14,716 --> 01:11:16,093
No matter.

242
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,553
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

243
01:11:23,182 --> 01:11:24,559
You're lying.

244
01:11:25,268 --> 01:11:26,352
Am I?

245
01:11:43,785 --> 01:11:45,995
Ms. Finneran's escort while
she's here in Los Angeles.

246
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:49,039
Never leaves her
side for a moment.

247
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,376
I thought you'd be glad
to know she's in good hands.

248
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,549
Now get some rest. The boat
will be ready for you on Friday.

249
01:11:59,841 --> 01:12:02,218
If I see you or any of
your friends before then...

250
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:04,595
Ms. Finneran will find
herself the victim...

251
01:12:04,846 --> 01:12:07,139
...of a most gruesome violation
before she dies.

252
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,642
As, indeed, your
father, Mr. Hockney...

253
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:13,520
...and your uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

254
01:12:14,313 --> 01:12:16,398
I might only castrate...

255
01:12:16,731 --> 01:12:18,441
...Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

256
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:22,320
Do I make myself clear?

257
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:25,323
We will take care of
the two bodies downstairs.

258
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:27,825
We'll add them to
the cost of Mr. Fenster.

259
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:29,994
Now if you'll excuse me,
gentlemen.

260
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:10,948
Geez. It's a logistical nightmare.

261
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:14,159
Close quarters. Ten, maybe twenty men.

262
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,995
There's no telling how many
more are gonna be below deck.

263
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,706
Can we stealth these guys?

264
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:23,001
No. With all that coke,
they are going to be ready.

265
01:13:24,293 --> 01:13:26,671
Which brings me to
sunny point number two.

266
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:30,799
Even if one of us gets through and
jacks the boat, we still get nothing.

267
01:13:31,008 --> 01:13:32,468
What if we wait for the money?

268
01:13:33,218 --> 01:13:35,262
Ten more men at least.

269
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:38,765
Look, in my opinion
it can't be done.

270
01:13:39,057 --> 01:13:41,100
Anybody who goes in there
is not coming out alive.

271
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:42,393
I'm gonna wait for the money.

272
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:44,062
Me too.

273
01:13:44,312 --> 01:13:46,022
Did you hear
what he just said?

274
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,399
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

275
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:52,403
There's nothing
that can't be done.

276
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:58,199
I just can't believe we're just
gonna walk into certain death.

277
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:08,084
News said it's raining
in New York.

278
01:14:29,854 --> 01:14:31,480
What language is that?

279
01:14:31,689 --> 01:14:34,691
I don't know. Russian, I think.

280
01:14:36,693 --> 01:14:38,153
Hungarian?

281
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,796
Package has arrived.

282
01:16:04,774 --> 01:16:05,650
You kids are ready?

283
01:16:06,817 --> 01:16:08,277
I would be if I wouldn't have
to stop and answer you.

284
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:10,613
I'm ready.

285
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:13,824
McManus, you better be
set up in ten seconds.

286
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:16,952
I'm ready.

287
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,246
I want you to stay here.

288
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:22,874
But I'm supposed to cover--

289
01:16:23,207 --> 01:16:25,960
Listen, if we don't get out of this
I want you to take the money and go.

290
01:16:26,794 --> 01:16:29,380
Find Edie, tell her what
happened. Tell her everything.

291
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:31,173
She knows people.
She knows what to do.

292
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,843
If I don't get Kobayashi
my way, she'll get him her way.

293
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:37,095
Just do what I say.

294
01:16:38,096 --> 01:16:39,264
Please.

295
01:16:42,475 --> 01:16:43,685
Tell her that...

296
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,356
Tell her I tried.

297
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:04,871
McManus. He's on his way.

298
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,539
I'm there.

299
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:09,013
Huh. Oswald was a fag.

300
01:18:19,272 --> 01:18:20,523
Hi. How are you doing?

301
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:25,778
Is there... a problem?

302
01:18:51,552 --> 01:18:52,302
Now...

303
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,623
Old McDonald...

304
01:19:23,915 --> 01:19:25,291
...had a farm...

305
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:28,085
...ee-aye, ee-aye, oh.

306
01:19:29,044 --> 01:19:33,132
And on that farm
he shot some guys...

307
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:36,259
...ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing,
bang-boom.

308
01:20:07,246 --> 01:20:08,456
Elvis has left the building.

309
01:22:31,754 --> 01:22:33,130
Why didn't you run?

310
01:22:34,089 --> 01:22:35,090
I froze up.

311
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:39,135
I thought about Fenster and how
he looked when we buried him.

312
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:42,722
And I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

313
01:22:50,271 --> 01:22:53,023
A boy came across a body on the beach
this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned...

314
01:22:53,232 --> 01:22:56,234
...shot twice in the head. Two guys
from the Bureau just identified him.

315
01:22:56,443 --> 01:22:57,110
What else?

316
01:22:57,319 --> 01:23:00,405
His name was Arturo Marquez,
a petty smuggler from Argentina.

317
01:23:00,613 --> 01:23:03,366
He was arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

318
01:23:03,574 --> 01:23:07,036
He escaped to California.
They picked him up in Long Beach...

319
01:23:07,370 --> 01:23:10,581
...they're setting up
extradition - he escapes again.

320
01:23:10,789 --> 01:23:12,082
Now, get this...

321
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:15,669
Edie Finneran is brought in
to advice in the proceedings.

322
01:23:16,002 --> 01:23:17,170
Kobayashi.

323
01:23:17,379 --> 01:23:20,590
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony. He was a rat.

324
01:23:20,799 --> 01:23:21,925
A big fucking rat.

325
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:24,844
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

326
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:29,014
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

327
01:23:29,223 --> 01:23:31,558
Guess who he named in finale?

328
01:23:32,518 --> 01:23:33,977
Keyser Soze.

329
01:23:34,269 --> 01:23:35,604
There's more.

330
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:51,910
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

331
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,081
There was no dope on that boat.

332
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:38,912
Stay quiet!

333
01:24:39,287 --> 01:24:42,123
He's here!
I know he's here!

334
01:24:42,957 --> 01:24:44,917
That's him!
I'm telling you that's him!

335
01:24:45,209 --> 01:24:46,919
I know he's here!

336
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:50,464
You don't understand.
That's him...

337
01:24:50,673 --> 01:24:51,840
- Shut up!
- That's him, you hear me?

338
01:24:52,883 --> 01:24:54,885
I'm telling you
it's Keyser Soze!

339
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:57,372
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know. There's no coke!

340
01:26:58,832 --> 01:27:01,126
- What?
- You heard me, you dumb fuck. There's no coke!

341
01:27:01,626 --> 01:27:04,796
I checked the entire ship!
I've been in every fucking room!

342
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:07,381
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

343
01:27:07,631 --> 01:27:08,966
Nothing!

344
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,718
You're fucking me!

345
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:14,763
There is... no... fucking... coke!

346
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:27,358
I'm outta here.

347
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:10,397
I told them nothing.

348
01:28:11,398 --> 01:28:12,816
I swear.

349
01:28:13,358 --> 01:28:15,819
I told them nothing. Please!

350
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:05,198
McManus?
What the fuck is going on?

351
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:09,535
Strangest thing...

352
01:30:04,085 --> 01:30:07,088
That's what you said in your statement:
"A man in a suit with a slim build."

353
01:30:07,296 --> 01:30:07,922
Wait a minute.

354
01:30:08,172 --> 01:30:10,674
I don't have a minute.
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

355
01:30:10,883 --> 01:30:12,760
You told the D.A. you
didn't know who it was!

356
01:30:12,968 --> 01:30:14,678
I know there was
dope on that boat.

357
01:30:14,886 --> 01:30:16,221
- Stop stalling, Verbal!
- I'm not stalling!

358
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:18,765
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

359
01:30:18,974 --> 01:30:21,059
I've got immunity, I don't
have to take that shit.

360
01:30:21,267 --> 01:30:23,102
You know... what
I'm getting at, Verbal.

361
01:30:23,311 --> 01:30:24,062
I don't know what
you're talking about.

362
01:30:24,604 --> 01:30:25,855
Yes you do... the truth!

363
01:30:26,063 --> 01:30:29,066
- Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
- I don't know what you're talking about. I did!

364
01:30:29,316 --> 01:30:30,693
You're lying to me!

365
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,320
You know. You've known
this whole fucking time!

366
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:36,615
I don't know what you're saying.
I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

367
01:30:37,115 --> 01:30:39,826
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun! Why didn't you help him?

368
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:41,452
He was your friend!

369
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,833
Because I was afraid.
Ok? Afraid!

370
01:30:50,794 --> 01:30:52,087
Afraid of what?

371
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:55,549
I know it was Keyser Soze!

372
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:59,636
It was Keyser Soze.
I mean, Agent Kujan, the devil himself.

373
01:31:01,179 --> 01:31:03,556
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

374
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,937
What if you miss?

375
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:17,068
All right.
Let's get back to the pier.

376
01:32:40,311 --> 01:32:42,021
Arturo Marquez.
Ever hear of him?

377
01:32:42,272 --> 01:32:43,523
What? No.

378
01:32:43,856 --> 01:32:47,568
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

379
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,156
He swore out a statement to
Federal Marshals saying that he had seen...

380
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:54,074
...and could positively
identify one Keyser Soze.

381
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:57,953
It says right here in the report.
He had intimate knowledge of his businesses...

382
01:32:58,203 --> 01:33:00,080
...including, but not exclusive to...

383
01:33:00,413 --> 01:33:02,040
...drug trafficking and murder.

384
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:05,126
- I never heard of him.
- His own people were selling him...

385
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:06,294
...to a gang of Hungarians.

386
01:33:06,752 --> 01:33:10,172
Most likely the same Hungarians that
Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

387
01:33:10,589 --> 01:33:11,799
The money wasn't there for dope.

388
01:33:12,466 --> 01:33:14,760
The Hungarians were
going to buy the one guy...

389
01:33:15,093 --> 01:33:16,803
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

390
01:33:17,095 --> 01:33:18,263
I said I never heard of him.

391
01:33:18,597 --> 01:33:19,347
But Keaton did.

392
01:33:19,723 --> 01:33:20,473
Edie Finneran was...

393
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:22,475
...Marquez' extradition advisor.

394
01:33:23,059 --> 01:33:24,435
She knew who he was
and what he knew.

395
01:33:25,645 --> 01:33:27,438
- I don't und--
- There were no drugs on that boat.

396
01:33:27,688 --> 01:33:31,275
It was a hit. A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

397
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:33,569
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

398
01:33:33,944 --> 01:33:35,737
So Soze put some thiefs to it.

399
01:33:36,363 --> 01:33:38,490
Men he knew he could
march into certain death.

400
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:41,367
You say Soze sent us
to kill someone?

401
01:33:42,535 --> 01:33:43,286
I'm saying Keaton did.

402
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:45,246
Verbal, he left you
behind for a reason.

403
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,289
Just do what I tell you.

404
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:50,542
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

405
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:54,379
...why did he give you the money to run?
He could have used you on the boat.

406
01:33:54,755 --> 01:33:55,839
He wanted me to live.

407
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,509
A one time dirty cop
without a loyalty in the world...

408
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,011
...finds it that it's hard to save...

409
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:03,554
...a worthless rat-cripple

410
01:34:03,846 --> 01:34:04,972
No, sir!
Why?

411
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:06,891
Edie!

412
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:09,602
I don't buy that reform
story for a minute!

413
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,354
Even if I did, I certainly
don't believe...

414
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:15,941
...he would send you to protect her.
So why?

415
01:34:18,818 --> 01:34:20,528
Because he was my friend!

416
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,281
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.

417
01:34:23,531 --> 01:34:24,907
Keaton didn't have friends!

418
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:26,033
What are you doing here?

419
01:34:26,284 --> 01:34:27,284
He saved you...

420
01:34:27,576 --> 01:34:30,079
...because he wanted it that way!
It was his will.

421
01:34:30,829 --> 01:34:33,290
- Keaton was Keyser Soze!
- No!

422
01:34:33,624 --> 01:34:35,417
The kind of man who could
wrangle the wills of men...

423
01:34:35,709 --> 01:34:36,877
...like Hockney and McManus.

424
01:34:37,127 --> 01:34:37,836
The kind of man...

425
01:34:38,086 --> 01:34:40,046
...who could engineer
a police line-up...

426
01:34:40,338 --> 01:34:42,131
...from all his years
of contacts in N.Y.P.D. .

427
01:34:42,757 --> 01:34:44,967
The kind of man that could
have killed Edie Finneran!

428
01:34:50,014 --> 01:34:52,850
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania.

429
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,977
Shot twice in the head.

430
01:34:59,814 --> 01:35:01,983
What do you think
about Keaton now, Verbal?

431
01:35:03,609 --> 01:35:06,487
- Edie...
- He used all of you...

432
01:35:07,113 --> 01:35:08,739
...to get him on that boat.
He couldn't get on alone...

433
01:35:08,948 --> 01:35:12,076
...he had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

434
01:35:12,284 --> 01:35:14,786
The one man that could identify him.

435
01:35:15,871 --> 01:35:17,581
This is all bullshit...

436
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:19,708
You said you saw him die?

437
01:35:22,335 --> 01:35:23,211
Or did you?

438
01:35:23,586 --> 01:35:25,546
You had to hide when you
first heard the police cars.

439
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,215
You said you heard
the shot before the fire.

440
01:35:28,758 --> 01:35:30,801
But you didn't see him die.

441
01:35:31,093 --> 01:35:32,469
I knew him.
He would never--

442
01:35:32,678 --> 01:35:33,887
He programmed you!

443
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:36,473
He programmed you to tell us
just what he wanted you to!

444
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:38,767
He knew we were close,
you said it yourself.

445
01:35:38,975 --> 01:35:41,895
Where was the political pressure coming from?
Why were you being protected?

446
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:44,897
It was Keaton!
Immunity was your reward!

447
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:46,816
Why me?

448
01:35:47,316 --> 01:35:49,276
Why not Fenster or
McManus or Hockney?

449
01:35:49,485 --> 01:35:51,945
Why me? I'm stupid,
I'm a cripple! Why me?

450
01:35:52,196 --> 01:35:53,572
Because you're
a cripple, Verbal.

451
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:57,617
Because you're stupid.
Because you're weaker than them.

452
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,539
If he's dead...

453
01:36:04,123 --> 01:36:07,501
...if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

454
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:12,297
It was his idea to hit the
taxi service in New York, wasn't it?

455
01:36:12,589 --> 01:36:13,757
Come on, tell me
the truth.

456
01:36:14,007 --> 01:36:15,634
It was all Keaton!

457
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:19,846
We followed him
from the beginning.

458
01:36:21,347 --> 01:36:22,348
I didn't know.

459
01:36:23,016 --> 01:36:24,976
I saw him die.

460
01:36:25,518 --> 01:36:28,687
I believe he's dead.
Oh, Christ!

461
01:36:29,939 --> 01:36:31,482
You're not safe
on your own.

462
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:36,862
You think he's--

463
01:36:37,237 --> 01:36:38,697
Keyser Soze?

464
01:36:39,614 --> 01:36:41,241
I don't know, Verbal.

465
01:36:42,784 --> 01:36:46,412
Keyser Soze is a shield.
Like you said, a spook story.

466
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:51,417
But I know Keaton.
And someone is out there pulling strings for you.

467
01:36:52,126 --> 01:36:53,377
Stay here and
let us protect you.

468
01:36:53,627 --> 01:36:55,629
No way. I'm not bait.
I post today.

469
01:36:55,962 --> 01:36:57,172
You posted 20 minutes ago.

470
01:36:57,881 --> 01:36:59,883
Capt. Leo wants you
out of here A.S.A.P. ...

471
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:03,094
- ...unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances, thank you.

472
01:37:03,469 --> 01:37:06,973
If someone wants to get you...
they're gonna get you out there.

473
01:37:07,223 --> 01:37:10,559
Turn states evidence.
You might never see trial.

474
01:37:10,809 --> 01:37:12,186
May be so.

475
01:37:13,645 --> 01:37:15,897
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

476
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:34,039
Fucking cops.

477
01:37:58,186 --> 01:38:00,688
Excuse me.
Can I use your fax machine?

478
01:38:04,692 --> 01:38:06,527
You have to sign for these.

479
01:38:09,530 --> 01:38:11,365
One watch, gold.

480
01:38:11,657 --> 01:38:13,700
One cigarette lighter, gold.

481
01:38:14,618 --> 01:38:16,536
And a pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

482
01:38:17,287 --> 01:38:19,414
You still got nothing, Dave.

483
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:21,916
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

484
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:23,668
Just nothing.

485
01:38:24,127 --> 01:38:27,338
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

486
01:38:28,214 --> 01:38:30,924
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

487
01:38:31,175 --> 01:38:33,886
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not coming up again.

488
01:38:34,511 --> 01:38:36,179
I'll find him.

489
01:38:36,763 --> 01:38:38,390
Waste of time.

490
01:38:40,975 --> 01:38:43,561
A rumor is not a rumor
that doesn't die.

491
01:38:43,895 --> 01:38:44,937
What?

492
01:38:46,105 --> 01:38:46,981
Nothing.

493
01:38:49,066 --> 01:38:50,693
Man, you're a slob.

494
01:38:50,901 --> 01:38:53,779
Yeah, but all has a system, Dave.

495
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:57,824
It all makes sense when you look at it right.
You've got to stand back from it, you know?

496
01:39:00,118 --> 01:39:02,912
You want to see a real horror show?
You should see my garage.

497
01:39:40,405 --> 01:39:42,198
Convince me. And tell me every last detail...

498
01:39:42,615 --> 01:39:44,826
You know, back when I was in that
barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois...

499
01:39:45,284 --> 01:39:46,619
Where's your head, Agent Kujan?

500
01:39:46,953 --> 01:39:47,912
What we need to do is think.

501
01:39:48,204 --> 01:39:49,079
Think back.

502
01:39:49,413 --> 01:39:50,664
I'm sure you've heard many tall tales...

503
01:39:50,914 --> 01:39:52,332
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

504
01:39:52,624 --> 01:39:53,667
- I just want to hear your story.
- Tell me every last detail.

505
01:39:53,959 --> 01:39:56,336
It's all there.
And I'm telling it all straight, I swear.

506
01:39:56,837 --> 01:39:58,672
- Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
- A gift...

507
01:39:59,005 --> 01:40:00,673
- ...from Mr. Soze.
- Talk to me, Verbal.

508
01:40:01,174 --> 01:40:02,300
What about Redfoot?

509
01:40:02,675 --> 01:40:04,135
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

510
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:07,388
- ...using pawns...
- Big, fat guy. I mean, like orca-fat.

511
01:40:11,225 --> 01:40:14,353
Back when I was picking beans in
Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee...

512
01:40:14,728 --> 01:40:15,979
...he was a good man...

513
01:40:16,313 --> 01:40:17,022
I know he was good.

514
01:40:20,025 --> 01:40:21,818
Tell me every last detail.

515
01:40:22,068 --> 01:40:22,694
Strangest thing.

516
01:40:22,986 --> 01:40:24,362
How do you shoot
the devil in the back?

517
01:40:24,904 --> 01:40:26,572
...this guy is protected
from up on high...

518
01:40:26,822 --> 01:40:28,157
...by the prince of darkness.

519
01:40:28,407 --> 01:40:30,034
What about it, pretzel-man?
What's your story.

520
01:40:30,409 --> 01:40:32,161
- There was a lawyer...
- What lawyer, Verbal?

521
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:33,954
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

522
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,082
Tell me every last detail.

523
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:38,583
I work for Keyser Soze.

524
01:40:38,792 --> 01:40:40,919
Convince me.

525
01:40:56,391 --> 01:41:00,520
Every creeping scumbag that works the street
for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint.

526
01:41:01,146 --> 01:41:02,689
The cripple!
Did you see him?

527
01:41:02,939 --> 01:41:04,440
The cripple!
Which way did he go?

528
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:05,858
Oh, he went out that way.

529
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:08,486
I know you know something.

530
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,446
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I want to know...

531
01:41:10,738 --> 01:41:12,197
...wether you like it or not.

532
01:41:12,406 --> 01:41:15,659
To a cop the explanation is never
that complicated. It's always simple.

533
01:41:16,535 --> 01:41:18,828
There's no mistery to the street,
no arch-criminal behind it all.

534
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,289
Somebody with power...

535
01:41:21,498 --> 01:41:23,624
Keyser Soze!

536
01:41:24,834 --> 01:41:29,255
You think a guy like that comes this close
to getting caught and sticks his head out?

537
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:33,800
Because you're stupid, Verbal!
Because you're a cripple!

538
01:41:34,009 --> 01:41:35,302
What I want to know
is who's the gimp.

539
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:37,804
You know.
You've known the whole fucking time!

540
01:41:38,638 --> 01:41:40,557
If he comes up for anything,
it will be to get rid of me.

541
01:41:42,058 --> 01:41:45,394
I can't feel my legs... Keyser.

542
01:41:45,603 --> 01:41:48,939
First thing I learned on the job,
you know what it was?

543
01:41:49,315 --> 01:41:52,401
He mentioned Keyser Soze?

544
01:41:53,152 --> 01:41:54,278
Who?

545
01:41:54,528 --> 01:41:56,029
After that...

546
01:41:56,571 --> 01:41:59,324
...my guess is you'll never
hear from him again.

547
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:22,387
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

548
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,223
...was convincing the
world he didn't exist.

549
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:28,309
And like that...

550
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:31,729
...he's gone.

551
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,500
