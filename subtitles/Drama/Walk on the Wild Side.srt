1
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,845
What's that?

2
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:43,570
Who's that?

3
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,476
Who's that?

4
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:48,049
Hey, go on, get out of here.

5
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:55,452
I said, go on, get out of here.
Come on, get out.

6
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,890
What are you doing here?

7
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:04,357
My doctor recommended fresh air.
What are you here for?

8
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,766
- Looking for a place to sleep.
- Well, this room's occupied.

9
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:10,668
How about this one next door?

10
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:14,971
- Ask the night clerk. Don't bother me.
- What are you so mad about?

11
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,010
I'm cold, hungry and a million
miles from nowhere...

12
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,776
...and in the middle of a wild dream,
you wake me up.

13
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:23,317
I'm sorry.

14
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,347
Hey, mister,
you got something to eat?

15
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,265
Here.

16
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:50,005
I can't help it if I slobber.
I ain't eaten all day.

17
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:52,206
Don't bother me none.

18
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:55,874
I wish I had some more.
Well, see you in the morning.

19
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:04,384
Hey, mister?

20
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:11,529
Something tells me you're new at this
game. A babe in the great big woods.

21
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,661
It's my first night out in the world.

22
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,036
Yeah?
You need looking after.

23
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:23,270
Come on to my room, it's warmer.
I got the end stopped up.

24
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:27,315
Besides, you don't look
like someone invited you, girl.

25
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,918
Come on, I won't bite.

26
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,911
Besides, I got twin beds.

27
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:37,125
- After you.
- Gentlemen first.

28
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:04,612
- Let go. You're gonna bust my hand!
- It'll serve you right.

29
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,187
Let go!

30
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,483
Oh, let go!

31
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,560
Man, that sure was
a dumb thing to try.

32
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,821
Well, I'm hungry.

33
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,058
And I've been dreaming
all night about potatoes.

34
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:23,297
- That's still no reason.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do to me?

35
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:27,933
Nothing. You ain't done nothing.
You just tried.

36
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,579
You wouldn't have got much...

37
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,710
...but I got the price of a couple
of breakfasts, if that's all you want.

38
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:41,554
You mean it?

39
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:48,327
You're a real gentleman,
mister. Mister...?

40
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:51,956
Dove. Dove Linkhorn.

41
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:01,266
Oh, man, my bones feel
like they been through a mangle.

42
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:06,543
Where you headed for,
Dove Linkhorn?

43
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,151
New Orleans.

44
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,549
Well, strike me blind. So am I.

45
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,148
Oh, I am fed up with this
great big, undone hunk of state.

46
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,127
I'm going to New Orleans.

47
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:23,198
- They better nail it down when I arrive.
- You're gonna need a buck for that.

48
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,995
Well, a girl always needs a buck.

49
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,637
She's got other things she can use.

50
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:46,181
- Thanks.
- You're welcome

51
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:50,793
Oh, boy. We sure are greenhorn.

52
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:55,223
But don't worry. A few lessons from
Mama Twist and you'll be a old pro.

53
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,663
Where'd you get a name like...

54
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,502
What were you saying?

55
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:12,273
I said, where'd you get
a name like "Twist"?

56
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:14,076
Kitty Twist?

57
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:17,243
That's what they took
to calling me in the home.

58
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,218
Kitty Twist.

59
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:23,815
You know what my real name is?
Tristram.

60
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:25,552
No folks?

61
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,530
Yeah. Yeah, I got a ma,
up in Kentucky.

62
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,795
Like as not she's drunk herself
to death by now.

63
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,633
Kind of bad, having a ma like that.

64
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,235
Even if it stinks, it's home.

65
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,714
You ain't much of a talker, are you?

66
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,125
Well, it's been my experience
that the talkers ain't never cute...

67
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,823
...and the cute ones
ain't never talkers.

68
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,433
And you're cute.

69
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,910
Hey, Dove.

70
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:21,847
This is where we gotta get off.

71
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,112
Beaumont's a right mean town
to get through.

72
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,312
Lesson number one:

73
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,018
Get off while the train's moving,
on the side away from the station.

74
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:47,501
Give me a couple of them
tomatoes too.

75
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,511
- How much is that?
- 35 cents.

76
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:56,346
Thank you.

77
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,695
Rise and shine.

78
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:13,295
You're surprised, huh?

79
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,033
Every part of me cried out
for attention, so I gave it.

80
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:20,537
Man, you sure do look different.

81
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,814
Oh, boy, you not only don't
talk much, you don't say much.

82
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,414
Food, come on.
Why we wasting time? Let's eat.

83
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,611
Come on, then.

84
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:47,366
Hey, you throw
pretty good for a girl.

85
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:50,768
For a girl, hell. Walter Johnson
never throwed better.

86
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,172
I'm a big-league kid
from a big-league town.

87
00:10:56,213 --> 00:11:00,616
Clang! Clang! All aboard!

88
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:05,048
Dove, one of these days
I'm gonna make some money...

89
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,123
...and I'll do something for you.
- Like what?

90
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:12,193
I'm gonna get you a pair of real city
shoes and a real shirt.

91
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,830
I'm gonna dress you in the finest.

92
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:16,465
Come on, let's go.

93
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:20,034
We got 300 miles
to get to New Orleans.

94
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:29,806
- Dove. You got the food, I get the lifts.
- Sure.

95
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,778
You go wait behind that tree.
Come quick when I whistle.

96
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:34,610
I'll do that.

97
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,206
- Hi.
- Hop in, honey.

98
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,239
Sorry, kid...

99
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:13,856
...giving lifts is against regulation.
- Yeah, but wait. He's my brother.

100
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:26,729
What did you tell him?

101
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:30,669
Never mind. Just cough now
and then like you're dying.

102
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,116
So it's gonna be you.

103
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,513
You and me.

104
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:50,120
Oh, we're gonna have a good time,
ain't we, Dove?

105
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,893
I made up my mind
when I run away from the home.

106
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,197
I'm gonna have a good time.
Nothing else, just a good time.

107
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:05,336
I ain't looking for a good time.

108
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:08,375
Oh, yeah?
What else are you doing tonight?

109
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:11,673
Resting up for New Orleans.

110
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:13,247
You'll like me, Dove.

111
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,283
Sure, I like you, Kitty,
but I don't feel like fooling.

112
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:19,153
Come here, and I'll make you
feel like fooling.

113
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:21,984
When I want something,
I'll ask for it.

114
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,494
Who are you saving it for, Dove?

115
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,096
What's her name?

116
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:37,000
Hallie.

117
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,202
Her name's Hallie.

118
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,817
She in New Orleans?

119
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,918
I hope so.

120
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:53,713
I ain't seen her in three years.

121
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,985
I'll never forget the first time
I met her.

122
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:02,531
We went swimming together.

123
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,894
It was at night.

124
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:10,369
The way she moved in the water,
like a kind of a white flash.

125
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:16,112
It was then I kissed her
for the very first time.

126
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,545
She gave me something
I'd never known before.

127
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:23,076
Something I ain't experienced since.

128
00:14:24,387 --> 00:14:26,685
Afterwards, in the moonlight...

129
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:29,586
...we danced
like we was celebrating a miracle.

130
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,787
A crazy kind of dance.
And then we sang and shouted...

131
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:37,497
...like it wasn't real.

132
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,462
As if it was in another world.

133
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,940
Sometimes I think it never really
happened to us.

134
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:49,010
She sounds kind of wild. Like me.

135
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,011
She ain't like nobody.

136
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,946
You think I'm just a tramp, don't you?

137
00:14:56,119 --> 00:15:00,613
Well, I'm not!
I may act like one, but I'm not.

138
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:05,687
You just wait, Dove Linkhorn. One
of these days you're gonna ask me.

139
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:10,196
And I'm gonna say,
"Sorry, mister, this seat's occupied."

140
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:22,468
It's a shame. We could
have had such a good time.

141
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,290
Gotta drop you here.

142
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:44,433
Never know when we're gonna run
into an inspector up ahead.

143
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:47,092
You're in walking distance
of New Orleans, though.

144
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,001
Oh, thanks a lot, mister. Brother and
me will remember you in our prayers.

145
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:53,938
- You can be sure of that.
- Much obliged for the ride.

146
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,975
That's okay, good luck. Let's go.

147
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,242
Bless you. Just bless you.

148
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:04,848
- Come on, I'll show you New Orleans.
- I smell chili. I'm hungry.

149
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:09,722
- New Orleans is full of chili.
- I can't walk on an empty stomach.

150
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:11,985
Oh, you can't walk.

151
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:16,121
You're crazy! Always getting
hungry, like you was a millionaire.

152
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:17,926
Come on, kid.

153
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,781
Give me a cigarette there, Kitty,
will you?

154
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,757
It sure smells good.

155
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:47,396
Hey, you want some coffee?

156
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,498
- Please.
- Okay.

157
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,330
Two chilies and two coffees, please.

158
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,169
A piece of that cherry pie.

159
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:03,005
You want the giant or the regular?

160
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,704
- Regular.
- You like some tortillas?

161
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:09,682
Yes, I sure would like some tortillas,
and some chicharrones too...

162
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:13,185
...but we'll just have a couple of bowls
of chili and two coffees.

163
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:15,620
- You're from Texas.
- How did you guess?

164
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm from Texas too.

165
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:20,657
Sounds like a real
old-fashioned reunion.

166
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:23,656
Where can I wash my hands,
please, ma'am?

167
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,996
- That door, to the left.
- Thank you.

168
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,230
Other side for ladies.

169
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:33,307
Personally, you can give me
good American food any day...

170
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:36,934
...but if he wants that other stuff,
bring it for us, will you?

171
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:38,944
Chicharrones and tortillas?

172
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,052
I hope it's easier to eat
than pronounce.

173
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,355
What's all this?

174
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:59,092
Ask me no questions, Dove.

175
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,329
You been asking for handouts?

176
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,632
Oh, you know,
you can be very insulting.

177
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:13,138
Well, ain't you gonna eat?

178
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:41,006
That's a nice song.

179
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:43,577
Sure does remind me of home.

180
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,846
What part of Texas you from?
Mexico?

181
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,819
I've had all I can chamber.

182
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,989
Well, let's go, then.

183
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,323
Hey, don't rush me. I'm too full to
move fast. Besides, I like that music.

184
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
Yeah, I know what you like.

185
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,697
Boy, she sure can cook.

186
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,810
Nobody can make chili
like a good Texas woman can.

187
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:20,415
Texas, Texas. That's all you
Texas people can talk about. Texas!

188
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:26,076
If we're gonna stay here, why don't
you put another tune on the box.

189
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:27,847
Sure thing, kid.

190
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,754
Maybe they've got "Mississippi Mud."

191
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,385
Nope. They don't have it.

192
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,093
Anything, then.

193
00:19:46,776 --> 00:19:48,300
That's my favorite.

194
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:54,814
- What is it? What's the matter?
- I don't know, it's a cramp.

195
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,576
- Dove.
- What's the matter, Kitty?

196
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:58,448
Oh, Dove, I feel sick.

197
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:00,952
I don't know, it's the chili, maybe.

198
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:02,421
The chili? Listen...

199
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,719
Oh, if I could lie down for a minute.

200
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,920
Come on, bring her to my room.
She can lie down, okay?

201
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,621
This way.

202
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:14,999
Oh, Dove.

203
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,009
Look, can I get you something?

204
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,913
Some hot tea or some soup...

205
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:33,453
No, nothing. Let me
just be quiet. I'll be all right.

206
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,853
Excuse me.

207
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,396
You feeling any better?

208
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:51,401
A little.

209
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:56,709
Dove, let me just rest
for a while by myself.

210
00:20:57,246 --> 00:21:00,477
I'll wait for you outside.
If you want anything, just holler.

211
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:26,568
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- No, no. This is my job.

212
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:04,743
Hey, you all right now.

213
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,778
- I never felt better.
- That's good.

214
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:11,146
Come on, Dove,
let's get out of here.

215
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,581
Are you coming or not?

216
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:17,817
How much do I owe you, ma'am?

217
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:20,728
That's 85 cents.

218
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:25,266
Eighty-five, nothing. We ain't paying
for food that almost killed me.

219
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:28,232
- Now, wait a minute, Kit, you can't...
- You know...

220
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:30,804
...I ought to take you
to the board of health.

221
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,669
They got laws about poisoning people
in public places.

222
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,038
- What are you trying to do?
- Don't be dumb.

223
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,737
I ought to take her to court
and sue for damages.

224
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,077
You know, legally, lady,
you're in trouble.

225
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:46,619
You recover quick for somebody
who is poisoned.

226
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:50,755
And if you've got insurance,
you're in worse trouble.

227
00:22:51,093 --> 00:22:53,027
Imagine, an innocent
person walking...

228
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:56,255
And of course you make
your living by walking.

229
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,627
That remark's gonna cost you extra.

230
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:04,202
It's on the house. Now, get out.

231
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:07,240
I don't like how,
for 85 cents, you smell.

232
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,401
Come on, Dove.

233
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:02,526
Some of my best ideas
come to me like that...

234
00:24:02,698 --> 00:24:04,859
...right on the spur of the moment.

235
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,830
Oh, Dove, you ought to always
let me take care of you.

236
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:10,632
I'm talented like that.

237
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:13,901
Here. Take this, it's yours.

238
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,837
One dollar. 85 cents, plus tip.

239
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,346
I didn't earn it.

240
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,417
You cheated for it.

241
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,485
You conned that woman for it.

242
00:24:24,654 --> 00:24:26,053
Take it, and we're quits.

243
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,381
Come on, take it.

244
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:38,766
- You stole this from her?
- I didn't steal it, I found it.

245
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:42,165
Lie, cheat, steal.
Is that all you know?

246
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:47,967
And you think that woman is better?
Trying to steal you away from me.

247
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:51,443
I just don't get you. I can understand
some things you've done...

248
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:54,674
...but stealing from someone
that's doing you a kindness...

249
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,442
...I just don't...
- Oh, child.

250
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,055
Those people are the best kind
to take. People who do you a favor...

251
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:03,191
...are too busy patting their
own backs to be watchful.

252
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,319
Stop talking like a no-good,
like you don't know what's right.

253
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:12,029
A good time is right.
Everything else is wrong.

254
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,061
Dove? Dove!

255
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,032
Don't go away.

256
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,676
Look, Dove, don't leave me alone.

257
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:25,609
You're heading for trouble, Kitty...

258
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:30,343
...but not with me.
Now, get out of my way and stay out.

259
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,081
What do you want?

260
00:26:11,427 --> 00:26:14,555
Oh, so this is what she took.

261
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,392
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Thank you.

262
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:20,126
You are very kind.

263
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:21,997
Listen, it's not much of a reward...

264
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:25,538
...but you wanna join me for coffee?
- Thank you.

265
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,944
And where is your friend?

266
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:35,884
I don't know.

267
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:42,124
That's one of the prettiest ones
I've ever seen.

268
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,122
You are Catholic?

269
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:49,829
What is your religion?

270
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,728
My religion?

271
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:55,100
It's a girl.

272
00:26:55,704 --> 00:26:59,071
Weighs about 119 pounds...

273
00:26:59,408 --> 00:27:01,399
...and gray eyes.

274
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:03,608
She's French.

275
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:07,374
And where? In what shrine
does this holy person stay?

276
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:11,653
It's a big city, I don't know yet.

277
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,755
You got her address?

278
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:17,317
- You got her name?
- Gerard.

279
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:19,324
Gerard.

280
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:21,463
How you spell that?

281
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:25,155
G-E-R-A-R-D.

282
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:28,133
What is her first name?

283
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:29,666
Hallie.

284
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,501
Hallie. That's a nice name.

285
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:35,535
My name is Teresina.

286
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,413
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

287
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,676
No, I don't find it.

288
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:45,545
Listen, maybe she's living
in a hotel.

289
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,121
Or maybe we find out
where she works.

290
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,552
What does she do?

291
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,558
She's an artist. Paints, sculpts.

292
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,762
Maybe to find this religion
we gotta put an ad in the newspaper.

293
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:01,630
In the personal columns.

294
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,101
I show you.

295
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,770
See?

296
00:28:08,143 --> 00:28:09,940
Like this.

297
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:16,677
"Anyone knowing...

298
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:19,650
...the whereabouts...

299
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:22,851
...of Hallie Gerard...

300
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,550
...please contact..."

301
00:28:27,062 --> 00:28:28,893
Dove Linkhorn.

302
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:30,463
Dove.

303
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,029
"Dove Linkhorn."

304
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:34,794
Pleased to meet you.

305
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,071
"Please contact
Dove Linkhorn at..."

306
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,467
Well, that's the trouble...

307
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:43,845
...I don't have no address.

308
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:46,440
Besides, how much would that cost?

309
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:49,243
I don't know, a few dollars.

310
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:53,819
I don't have it.
Until I find a job, I can't...

311
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:56,685
You know,
that was my favorite rosary.

312
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,463
I think maybe I ought
to give you a reward.

313
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,928
You don't owe me nothing.

314
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:09,603
So proud, so foolish, so in a hurry.

315
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:12,070
Can you change a tire?
Wash dishes?

316
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,438
- I'm pretty smart for my age.
- I can use some help here.

317
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,442
You're doing all right by yourself.

318
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:22,141
No. In rush hour,
it's hard with only two hands.

319
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:26,448
And they need a vacation from
dishwater. I don't have anybody...

320
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:31,082
...because the kind of man drifting
around nowadays I don't want.

321
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,455
How do you know I'm not that kind?

322
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,097
Easy.

323
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:39,799
You see, like all women,
I am romantic.

324
00:29:39,969 --> 00:29:42,938
You should find this woman
and marry her.

325
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:46,297
Look, I give you a salary,
not too big...

326
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:50,468
...meals, and you can sleep
in one of the cabins.

327
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,375
Okay?

328
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,913
You got yourself a hired hand.

329
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:59,950
I get you some blankets.

330
00:30:00,122 --> 00:30:03,853
Now, go on, finish the ad.
Now you got an address.

331
00:30:49,872 --> 00:30:51,430
It's in again.

332
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:55,105
Why do you keep bringing me that
like a retriever dog?

333
00:30:55,277 --> 00:30:58,576
- Every day for a week.
- Hallie never reads the newspapers.

334
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:01,739
He'll get tired of wasting his money.

335
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:05,444
It's a big city, full of lost girls.

336
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:08,521
Well, I just don't want you
to get upset, Jo.

337
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,751
It's you who is upset, not me.

338
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,396
He's so close to the ground
he picks up all the tremors.

339
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:19,534
- You shut up or I'll...
- Stop it, boys.

340
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:21,999
I'm going up to see Hallie.

341
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:34,310
- Are you coming, Reba?
- Yeah, get a taxi. I'll be right out.

342
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:49,219
Hallie.

343
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:55,699
Hallie, it's 3 in the afternoon.

344
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:00,639
You're getting lazier and lazier.

345
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:02,436
Wake up.

346
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:10,674
- Come on, wake up.
- What for?

347
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,845
Well, you can't sleep
the whole day away.

348
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:39,009
What were you trying to do here,
strangle it?

349
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:01,092
Mama, is Miss Precious upstairs?

350
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,465
She's feeling kind of poorly,
Mr. Oliver.

351
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,506
When I saw her this morning, I said,
"You go lie down...

352
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:09,735
...and I'll tell Mr. Oliver
you ain't up to seeing nobody.

353
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:12,244
- Mr. Oliver's a gentleman and"...
- Mama...

354
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:14,143
...shut your mouth.

355
00:33:25,194 --> 00:33:27,492
I wonder what she's done now.

356
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:52,453
Morning, Oliver.
I was just thinking about you.

357
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,554
Was you, honey?

358
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:01,128
What was you thinking?

359
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,229
I was thinking how the colonel
used to say...

360
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,925
...that love was really
all that mattered.

361
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:10,731
That it melted the hardest heart.

362
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,999
You ever watch
the movies, Precious?

363
00:34:16,545 --> 00:34:19,946
What do they do to a girl
that holds out on the house?

364
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,907
Oh, Oliver...

365
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:26,885
...I know I was drunk last night,
but I didn't mean it.

366
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:30,818
See, this man gave me a tip,
and it was just a little tip.

367
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:33,655
He said, "Go out and buy yourself
some stockings."

368
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,356
Oh, Oliver, if you'd just as soon,
I'd just as soon you not whip me...

369
00:34:37,532 --> 00:34:40,296
...if I got my sooners.
- I'd sooner not, sugar.

370
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,869
But you gotta learn not
to steal no more.

371
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,302
Hallie, this is none
of your business!

372
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:54,809
Hallie!

373
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,984
- Stop it!
- Oh, Hallie! Stay out of here!

374
00:34:58,153 --> 00:35:01,554
- Go away, Hallie.
- Get out of this room.

375
00:35:02,257 --> 00:35:05,988
- I am not finished yet.
- I said, get out of here.

376
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,287
- She's been stealing again.
- I don't care.

377
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:11,864
Don't you ever touch her again.
Come here.

378
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:16,433
It's gonna be all right, Precious.

379
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:19,098
I never interfere with you,
do I, Hallie?

380
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:23,233
- Little man, you couldn't.
- I've taken quite a lot off you.

381
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:26,074
Not even remotely
what you've deserved.

382
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:29,217
He shouldn't have
done that, Hallie.

383
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:32,152
The colonel wouldn't have
done that.

384
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:35,085
It's gonna be all right.

385
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:38,249
Hallie, let's get out of this place.
Let's leave here.

386
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,362
To do what?
Where would we go?

387
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:45,597
After three years of this easy life,
I don't have energy for anything else.

388
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:47,257
Do you?

389
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,937
Hallie, don't make me
answer that.

390
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:54,598
- Get me to crying again.
- Don't cry.

391
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,377
You'd better take care
of yourself.

392
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,345
You know,
Jo's got a terrible temper.

393
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:05,316
You don't know what I know.
What's the worst that can happen?

394
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:07,114
You die.

395
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:10,520
Oh, Hallie, you make me shiver.

396
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:13,160
- Don't say that.
- All right.

397
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,728
Pretty yourself up, now.

398
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,091
Here.

399
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:25,230
Don't steal anymore.

400
00:36:25,407 --> 00:36:29,867
Oh, Hallie.
Hallie, you're so good to me.

401
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:34,175
The colonel always said that you
could tell everything about a person...

402
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:37,113
...just by the size of their heart.

403
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,819
I've got to go now.
You'll be all right, won't you?

404
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,923
I'll see you later.

405
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:52,590
Now, don't say anything, Jo,
I warn you. Don't.

406
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,131
I wish you'd get rid of him, Jo.

407
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:57,737
I try to stay out of my employees'
private lives.

408
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:59,032
That's no answer.

409
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:02,176
I'm running a business,
and Oliver is necessary to that.

410
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:05,507
One of these days I'll go to
the Doll House and do something...

411
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,773
...about that necessity.

412
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:11,510
The less you go down
to the Doll House, the happier I'll be.

413
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:17,091
That was cruel, Jo.
She's got the mind of a little girl.

414
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:19,853
It was like beating a sick child.

415
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,758
I cannot stand that sort of cruelty.

416
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:24,523
I won't.

417
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,367
All right, Hallie.

418
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,232
I'll see that he never
touches her again.

419
00:37:32,374 --> 00:37:35,070
My, we are depressed, aren't we?

420
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,268
No, I'm bored.

421
00:37:37,579 --> 00:37:40,139
And I've only just gotten up.

422
00:37:40,515 --> 00:37:42,847
Maybe I ought to go back to bed.

423
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:45,509
You know, Hallie,
you're such a fantastic mixture.

424
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:49,282
- I'm different. I'm special.
- Yes, you are.

425
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:51,019
You're so wrong, Jo.

426
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:54,594
I'm no different than Precious,
Georgianne or the others.

427
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:57,231
- You are to me.
- Oh, don't humor me.

428
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,629
- Promise me one thing, Hallie.
- What?

429
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:02,269
You won't go down
to the Doll House anymore.

430
00:38:02,437 --> 00:38:03,927
Sorry, Jo.

431
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,834
I can't stay cooped up here.

432
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:09,534
I've got to break out,
to find excitement.

433
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:12,509
Lock me up, swallow the key
and I'll still crawl out...

434
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,774
...nibble my way out
through the plaster.

435
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,817
I know all your moods,
but this one is different.

436
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:20,079
- There's something...
- Please don't nag me.

437
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:23,713
- I'm only trying to understand you.
- Then stop trying to change me...

438
00:38:23,892 --> 00:38:26,292
...because I cannot change.

439
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:29,359
Oh, Jo, stop trying.

440
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:32,989
Just let me go on being what I am,
whatever that is.

441
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:36,599
All right, Hallie, I'll let you be.
Let's not quarrel.

442
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:39,205
It hurts me when we quarrel.
I'll tell you what.

443
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:42,537
Let's spend the afternoon here.
You can start a new head of me.

444
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,271
Or my hands.
You've always wanted to do my hands.

445
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,642
I'm not in the mood.

446
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:50,207
And you're too busy.

447
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,352
Besides, you haven't
got the patience.

448
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:56,814
Oh, you know me
better than that, Hallie.

449
00:38:57,759 --> 00:39:01,456
Sometimes I've waited years
for what I wanted.

450
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:38,491
Anybody call today?

451
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,157
Nobody.

452
00:39:56,952 --> 00:40:02,049
I'm getting the feeling
that it ain't Hallie that's lost, it's me.

453
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:03,713
Me!

454
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:07,628
I'm beginning to hate this town
and everything about it.

455
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:09,730
I'd like to kick it in.

456
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,526
Shake it, bust it wide open.

457
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:23,369
No wonder
you can't find your Hallie.

458
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,603
Maybe she doesn't
want to see you.

459
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,147
Maybe she knows what you are like.
All the time, sitting around...

460
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:32,946
...feeling sorry for yourself.
You are not so pleasant to be with.

461
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:36,147
Maybe she has gone away
because she knows you are here...

462
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:39,054
...and that you are no prize.
- Shut up, will you?

463
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:42,685
This is my café. No man tells me
to shut up in my own café!

464
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:15,262
I'm sorry, Dove...

465
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:17,625
...for talking like that.

466
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:20,258
I didn't mean it.

467
00:41:22,203 --> 00:41:23,727
You know...

468
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:27,136
You know how it is with a woman.

469
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:31,438
When they like somebody, right away
they gotta become a nuisance.

470
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:33,907
I am a nuisance.

471
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,849
Please, Dove.

472
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:42,948
Look, I brought you something.

473
00:41:45,627 --> 00:41:50,655
I know when men have pain,
sometimes they drink to forget...

474
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:52,732
...to ease the soul.

475
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:56,496
When my husband was alive,
that is what he used to do...

476
00:41:56,771 --> 00:42:01,572
...when he had too much worry
or trouble.

477
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:18,185
You know what I've been thinking?

478
00:42:18,426 --> 00:42:20,553
You know the repair shop?

479
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:23,857
I'm gonna open it,
and you're gonna run it.

480
00:42:24,032 --> 00:42:27,991
We could be partners.
And then you'll feel better.

481
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:32,265
Not so hopeless, not so lost.

482
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:39,403
Do you know what they call a man
who lives off a woman?

483
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:41,773
- They call him a...
- No.

484
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:44,241
No.

485
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:46,384
When people are kind
to each other...

486
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:49,853
...why do they have to find
a dirty word for it?

487
00:43:23,424 --> 00:43:24,914
Hallie?

488
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,450
Mr. Bonito's been waiting for you.

489
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:36,995
With company like you,
I don't know what he wants me for.

490
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,212
Shampoo.

491
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,695
Have you been waiting long?

492
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,328
- Long enough.
- You should have sent me up a note.

493
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:22,408
But I forget, you don't like to write.

494
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:25,239
You don't like me much.

495
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:29,577
Oh, that's not entirely true.
I'm very fond of you.

496
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,343
Did you buy me that Brancusi?

497
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:35,152
Nobody ever heard of him.
I asked the whole city hall.

498
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:36,847
He's a sculptor, darling.

499
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,017
Like Michelangelo, Maillol,
Rodin and me.

500
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:43,963
Last time
you told me you wrote poetry.

501
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:46,623
No.

502
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:48,926
I just echo it.

503
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:51,428
I'm a sculptress.

504
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:55,337
Or rather, I used to be
before I fell down the well.

505
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,842
But it's a very nice well.

506
00:45:58,012 --> 00:45:59,502
Cozy.

507
00:46:00,882 --> 00:46:03,783
And all the little frogs love me.

508
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:06,045
And the big frog...

509
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,747
...Madame Jo, adores me.

510
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:12,787
Yes, it's a very nice well.

511
00:46:13,261 --> 00:46:16,321
I have the run
of the bottom of the well.

512
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:22,628
I need some money.

513
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,730
What's it for this time?

514
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,399
It's for a...

515
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:33,308
It's for a lady friend of mine. She's got
another friend and her friend...

516
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,813
Oh, in fact,
it's her friend's friend's sister.

517
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:38,043
She's got a boyfriend.

518
00:46:38,286 --> 00:46:40,516
It's his birthday.

519
00:46:47,028 --> 00:46:48,859
You're a real gentleman.

520
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,693
One of the very few left
in the world.

521
00:46:53,568 --> 00:46:56,196
Stop smiling, Hallie, let's go.

522
00:46:56,371 --> 00:47:01,570
"And when she smiled it was
as if the moon came out."

523
00:47:01,976 --> 00:47:04,638
A remark by T.S. Eliot.

524
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:07,212
Ever heard of Eliot?
A bank clerk.

525
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:11,383
You know, Hallie,
smart from books ain't so smart.

526
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:19,088
Oh, but I forget,
you don't speak French.

527
00:47:22,196 --> 00:47:24,630
Did you ever hear of bread?

528
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:29,227
I butter yours. Jo's too,
this whole dump's.

529
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:32,771
Without me, you don't last a week.
Right?

530
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,601
I know.

531
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,810
We're all so grateful.

532
00:47:48,022 --> 00:47:51,514
With the compliments
of a Southern gentleman.

533
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:12,135
Hello?

534
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:22,683
One moment, please.

535
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:32,865
- Dove.
- Yeah?

536
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:35,525
Dove, it's the telephone for you.

537
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:43,803
- Hello?
- <i>I can talk only a minute.</i>

538
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:47,744
<i>If you want Hallie Gerard, you can</i>
<i>find her at 904 Chartres Street.</i>

539
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:51,017
Wha...?
Hello?

540
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,285
Was it Hallie?

541
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:57,390
No, but she said I could find Hallie.
904 Chartres Street.

542
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,321
Do you know where that is?

543
00:49:01,095 --> 00:49:03,586
- Yes.
- Where is it?

544
00:49:04,665 --> 00:49:08,624
Just go to the Quarter
and ask anyone.

545
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,298
What you want, mister?

546
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,566
I'm looking for Miss Hallie Gerard.

547
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:17,602
One flight up, first door.
Right up there.

548
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:19,569
Thank you.

549
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:47,261
Come in.

550
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:51,527
Hi.

551
00:50:55,977 --> 00:50:57,706
Hello, Hallie.

552
00:51:02,984 --> 00:51:04,474
Dove.

553
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:11,923
Precious, this is an old friend of mine,
Dove Linkhorn.

554
00:51:12,093 --> 00:51:15,460
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.
- Miss Precious lives down the hall.

555
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,861
Oh, Hallie's told me all about you,
Mr. Linkhorn.

556
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:23,129
And about Arroyo. You know, I never
even heard of Arroyo till I met Hallie.

557
00:51:23,904 --> 00:51:26,839
You see, you must excuse
my ignorance, I'm from Georgia.

558
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:29,340
It's just that I've never been
to Texas.

559
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,775
But I do know about the Alamo
and about the Panhandle.

560
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:34,812
Now, what in the world
is a panhandle?

561
00:51:35,616 --> 00:51:37,880
Do you know
I thought it meant "to beg"?

562
00:51:40,588 --> 00:51:42,283
Hallie says you're a farmer.

563
00:51:42,456 --> 00:51:45,050
Oh, I always wanted a farm.

564
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,494
The colonel always said,
"Two's company, three's a crowd."

565
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:50,460
- So I better be getting along.
- No...

566
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:54,158
No, when old friends meet, one
should leave them so they can talk.

567
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:55,962
The colonel always said...

568
00:51:56,137 --> 00:51:59,231
Well, nice to meet you,
Mr. Linkhorn.

569
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:11,647
You're looking well, Dove.

570
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:14,748
So are you, Hallie.

571
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,721
How's your father?

572
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,121
He's dead.

573
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:23,128
Oh, I'm sorry.

574
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,365
It was bound to happen.

575
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,660
Miracle was that he held out
so long.

576
00:52:30,504 --> 00:52:33,064
You loved him very much,
didn't you?

577
00:52:33,841 --> 00:52:36,605
Love or duty,
I'll never know which.

578
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:42,380
I lit out to find you
the moment I could.

579
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:45,482
I'm free now.

580
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:49,111
What?

581
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:52,120
Just yesterday I gave up hope.

582
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,055
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

583
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:57,493
Putting ads in the papers.

584
00:52:58,799 --> 00:53:01,359
I didn't think I'd ever find you.

585
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:11,237
Now it seems like those three years
never passed.

586
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:13,437
Look, Dove,
I should have written you.

587
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,884
But you did write.

588
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:20,248
You wrote me 12 letters.

589
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,787
I should have written you a 13th...

590
00:53:24,024 --> 00:53:25,582
...telling you that...

591
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,854
- Telling me what?
- Oh, Dove.

592
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:32,760
Summers end, things change.

593
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,894
It was such a short time.

594
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:41,703
- Four months.
- And to you that's a lifetime.

595
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:44,367
Well, it lasted four months,
then it disappeared.

596
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:45,705
But it couldn't have.

597
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,408
It's nothing unusual for a love to end,
any more than it is for it to begin.

598
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:53,686
- But in your letters...
- I have a different life now...

599
00:53:53,854 --> 00:53:56,015
...different friends.

600
00:53:57,858 --> 00:54:00,190
- Hallie, I...
- Oh, damn it, Dove! Go away!

601
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:02,329
Will you go away!

602
00:54:04,932 --> 00:54:07,196
I'm sorry you found me.

603
00:54:09,336 --> 00:54:11,395
I didn't find you.

604
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:14,806
I found somebody else.

605
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:20,003
Dove, wait.

606
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:32,791
I don't want you
to go away hating me.

607
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:41,832
I'd like you to try to understand.

608
00:54:52,746 --> 00:54:55,738
After I left Texas,
I went to New York.

609
00:54:55,916 --> 00:54:57,850
New York.

610
00:54:58,452 --> 00:55:02,786
A mob of six million people,
and every one of them a stranger.

611
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:06,984
Sometimes the weeks passed
and nobody spoke to me...

612
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:11,598
...except a waitress, a bus driver,
or a guy on the make.

613
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:17,435
I was so lonely I ached all over.

614
00:55:19,073 --> 00:55:21,303
And I wrote you letters.

615
00:55:21,475 --> 00:55:23,409
And I cried for you.

616
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:26,842
In a cramped, dirty little room
I cried for you.

617
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:30,074
"Where is Dove?
Why doesn't he come?"

618
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:32,641
Hallie...

619
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:36,846
You knew I couldn't leave
my father.

620
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:40,894
- He was sick, he needed me.
- I was sick...

621
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,928
...scared sick, and I needed you.

622
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:47,061
Oh, Dove...

623
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:50,663
...if only you could have
given me hope.

624
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,668
I couldn't...

625
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:57,768
- I couldn't count my father's days.
- But I was counting mine.

626
00:56:00,247 --> 00:56:01,839
Anyway...

627
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,510
...one day a woman bought
a painting of mine...

628
00:56:05,686 --> 00:56:07,916
...from a little gallery
in the Village.

629
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:11,489
She found out where I lived
and came to see me.

630
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,292
I was flattered.

631
00:56:14,461 --> 00:56:18,090
The hungry, lonely artist
was discovered.

632
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:22,234
And suddenly everything changed.

633
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:25,497
And I stopped crying for you.

634
00:56:27,508 --> 00:56:30,409
I had a friend.
For the first time in a long time...

635
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:34,036
...I could speak with someone who
understood, who knew how I felt...

636
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:36,739
...who protected me and...

637
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,718
She lived here in New Orleans...

638
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:49,920
...and one day she asked me to come
with her, please, for the Mardi Gras.

639
00:56:50,197 --> 00:56:51,755
I came.

640
00:56:51,932 --> 00:56:56,767
She brought me to this place
for a drink and to this studio.

641
00:56:58,038 --> 00:57:01,405
Took a look around and I said
to myself:

642
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:03,634
"Hallie, this is it.

643
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:06,177
You're home at last."

644
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:10,778
Oh, Dove.

645
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,885
Go away.

646
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:15,544
Please go away.

647
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,656
Hallie, I can't.
I have too much to make up for.

648
00:57:22,196 --> 00:57:25,324
I'm no good for you anymore.
Believe me, I'm no good.

649
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:29,060
I've got so much love for you.
And it can't grow less, it can't have.

650
00:57:29,236 --> 00:57:30,965
Please go.

651
00:57:31,138 --> 00:57:33,265
- When can I see you again?
- I don't know.

652
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,839
- Tomorrow?
- No, I can't.

653
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:38,376
- I have too many things to do. I...
- The day after tomorrow?

654
00:57:39,046 --> 00:57:41,173
All right.
The day after tomorrow.

655
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:44,010
2:00 in front of Lafitte's.

656
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:46,810
Goodbye, Dove.

657
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:48,511
- Goodbye, Hallie.
- Goodbye.

658
00:57:48,689 --> 00:57:50,384
Excuse me.

659
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,356
- Who was that?
- Dove Linkhorn.

660
00:57:57,531 --> 00:57:59,692
Not a bad-looking boy.

661
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:04,465
All the way from Texas.
I'm sorry for him.

662
00:58:04,638 --> 00:58:07,163
Careful, Hallie.
Pity can be a dangerous emotion...

663
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:10,139
...and you have a great capacity
for it.

664
00:58:11,145 --> 00:58:13,443
Oh, I see you've started
working again.

665
00:58:13,614 --> 00:58:15,445
Why don't you go back to it?

666
00:58:15,616 --> 00:58:18,050
Suddenly I don't feel like working.

667
00:58:18,218 --> 00:58:20,448
All right, then, let's go shopping.

668
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:24,421
Sorry, I really don't feel
like doing anything today.

669
00:58:25,759 --> 00:58:28,227
The boy, he...

670
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:31,594
- He upset you that much?
- No.

671
00:58:35,869 --> 00:58:38,133
Yes. Yes, he did.

672
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:40,764
He reminded me
of everything I'm not...

673
00:58:40,941 --> 00:58:43,933
...and of everything
I thought I couldn't be.

674
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:55,550
<i>I didn't think I'd ever find you.</i>

675
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:57,546
<i>Now...</i>

676
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,089
<i>Oh, it seems like...</i>

677
00:59:01,361 --> 00:59:04,524
<i>Like those three years</i>
<i>never passed.</i>

678
00:59:22,616 --> 00:59:24,550
Hello, Dove.

679
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:34,627
You don't get saved
because you've been born in hell!

680
00:59:34,928 --> 00:59:39,797
You know, it's funny.
It's like I'm walking with another girl.

681
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,765
Her name's Hallie,
but I hardly know her.

682
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:47,299
You know, you look different,
even since yesterday.

683
00:59:47,474 --> 00:59:49,101
I'm sorry, Dove.

684
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:51,176
You're even more beautiful.

685
00:59:51,345 --> 00:59:52,835
Dove.

686
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,113
I want to tell you something,
and I have to.

687
00:59:56,283 --> 00:59:58,808
- What is it?
- It's about me.

688
00:59:58,986 --> 01:00:02,285
About how much of a stranger
to you I really am.

689
01:00:03,223 --> 01:00:04,850
I'm sorry...

690
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:07,024
...I cannot help it, but I'm...

691
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:08,752
Jezebel!

692
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:16,100
That's right, I mean you!
Now, both you sinners hurry and pass!

693
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,728
- You got no business with us, mister.
- Sinners is my business!

694
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:23,434
You and that hip-slinging
daughter of Satan.

695
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:28,713
You know, there's a smell of sulfur
and brimstone about you.

696
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:32,249
- A smell of hellfire!
- Who ordained you, preacher?

697
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,754
I am self-ordained, son.
I had the call.

698
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:40,487
You were called
by the wrong voice, mister.

699
01:00:40,661 --> 01:00:43,027
Lord, strike this sinner down!

700
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:46,928
Send a bolt down to smite
and consume the blasphemer now!

701
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,365
He won't hear you. Because
you're no friend of God or man...

702
01:00:50,537 --> 01:00:53,370
...standing there
hollering hate to the world.

703
01:00:53,974 --> 01:00:56,875
God is love.
God is mercy and forgiveness.

704
01:00:57,711 --> 01:01:00,407
Try preaching that sometime,
Mr. Preacher.

705
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:03,049
Teach people to forgive,
not to crawl in fear.

706
01:01:03,217 --> 01:01:07,119
Teach people to love, not hate!
Preach the Good Book!

707
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:10,654
Preach the truth!
Come on, Hallie.

708
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,497
I'm sorry I got
so worked up, Hallie...

709
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:22,760
...but, well, he's got no right
to be preaching like that.

710
01:01:25,606 --> 01:01:27,665
What was it
you were gonna tell me?

711
01:01:27,841 --> 01:01:30,503
Nothing, Dove, nothing.

712
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:34,078
It's just, I'm so glad you're here.

713
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:36,375
Come on.

714
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,862
Everything's so green here.

715
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,794
You know,
you people are spoiled.

716
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:00,830
Where I come from...

717
01:02:01,675 --> 01:02:04,838
...the earth is brown and dusty
most of the year around.

718
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,242
Yes, I remember.

719
01:02:07,948 --> 01:02:10,109
It's so quiet here.

720
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:15,318
My father used to say that love
came on silent feet.

721
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:18,989
Poor Papa.

722
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:21,921
A man caught between two worlds.

723
01:02:22,629 --> 01:02:26,258
He was homesick for America,
yet he wouldn't leave Paris.

724
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:29,095
Then your mother
should have made him go.

725
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:33,195
My mother left when I was a child.

726
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,274
How could anyone leave you?

727
01:02:38,912 --> 01:02:41,312
She was so greedy for life.

728
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,346
She wanted so much.

729
01:02:43,517 --> 01:02:46,384
Not even a husband
and child were enough.

730
01:02:46,987 --> 01:02:49,649
She wanted to taste everything.

731
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:55,887
And I am my mother's child.

732
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,220
Tell me.

733
01:02:58,398 --> 01:03:02,061
- I'd like to know everything about you.
- There should be secrets...

734
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:04,135
...unknown things.

735
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:07,706
Not when two people are married.

736
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:12,277
Why, Dove, are you proposing?

737
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:20,619
Marry me, Hallie.

738
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:25,189
No, I can't.

739
01:03:26,326 --> 01:03:27,759
Give me one reason.

740
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:30,294
I'll give you a thousand.

741
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:35,160
Please, it's been such
a wonderful day. Don't spoil it.

742
01:03:36,203 --> 01:03:37,727
I'm...

743
01:03:37,904 --> 01:03:40,338
I'm sorry I spoiled your day...

744
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:42,668
...by asking you to be my wife.

745
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:46,004
Oh, no, no.
I didn't mean it that way. I...

746
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:50,115
It's...

747
01:03:50,717 --> 01:03:54,517
We haven't seen each other
for so long. For years.

748
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:57,519
Just give me time to think about it.

749
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:01,254
I can wait.

750
01:04:01,428 --> 01:04:03,794
I ain't got no train to catch.

751
01:04:30,023 --> 01:04:33,015
Hallie, you're late.
Jo wants to see you.

752
01:04:33,193 --> 01:04:35,491
I'll be down after I dress.

753
01:04:38,565 --> 01:04:41,932
Another thing. Too many girls
end up more loaded than the clients...

754
01:04:42,102 --> 01:04:44,229
...and their so-called brains
become addled.

755
01:04:44,404 --> 01:04:46,634
The customers take
advantage of them.

756
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:50,174
Think of the house, not yourself.
Call me if there's any trouble...

757
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:51,605
...or Oliver.

758
01:04:51,778 --> 01:04:54,178
Get yourself a gown.
You can pay me back later.

759
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:57,510
Oliver will show you where
to buy it and what kind.

760
01:04:58,552 --> 01:05:02,852
Miss Courtney, I wanna assure you
that I will cooperate in every way.

761
01:05:03,023 --> 01:05:06,117
Because, for me, it's an honor
to be working in the Doll House.

762
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:11,253
And if by accident I should
step on anybody's toes...

763
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:15,390
...or, like, a special boyfriend
or something like that...

764
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:18,766
...I just ask to be told nicely,
because it won't be intentional...

765
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:20,304
Get the mouthpiece on her.

766
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:23,671
And most of all, I wanna thank you
for getting me out of jail.

767
01:05:23,844 --> 01:05:27,041
You talk too much.
Get yourself that gown.

768
01:05:35,989 --> 01:05:37,422
Oliver.

769
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:40,891
Watch yourself,
she works for the house.

770
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:02,676
- Gin.
- Jo wants to see you, Hallie.

771
01:06:02,849 --> 01:06:04,680
- Yes, I know.
- Hey!

772
01:06:04,851 --> 01:06:06,751
Honeypot.

773
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,382
How's my baby?

774
01:06:09,556 --> 01:06:11,649
I've been waiting for you.

775
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:14,725
- Don't you remember me, baby?
- I'm afraid not.

776
01:06:14,895 --> 01:06:18,126
Lieutenant Omar Stroud,
United States Marines...

777
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:21,426
...reporting for active duty.
- We're at peace now, soldier.

778
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:25,264
No, baby, the dogs of war:

779
01:06:25,438 --> 01:06:28,930
- You hear them?
- Sounds like distemper to me.

780
01:06:29,776 --> 01:06:31,801
I'm sailing soon
for parts unknown, baby.

781
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:35,175
Darkest Panama.
Very dangerous down in Panama.

782
01:06:35,348 --> 01:06:38,784
- Jungle rot. Lose lots of men.
- Jo's waiting, Hallie.

783
01:06:38,952 --> 01:06:40,715
Sorry, lieutenant,
you'll excuse me.

784
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:43,754
To hell with this Joe guy.
I staked my claim first.

785
01:06:43,924 --> 01:06:45,255
Let her alone, lieutenant.

786
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:47,620
You want to get to Panama
all in one piece?

787
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:51,230
- Lots of other girls here.
- Not for Omar, buddy.

788
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:54,595
Geronimo. Remember?

789
01:06:54,768 --> 01:06:56,395
Let her alone.

790
01:06:57,537 --> 01:06:59,767
Okay. I retreat.

791
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,967
- Good luck, lieutenant.
- I'll be waiting, Hallie. Right here.

792
01:07:06,313 --> 01:07:09,214
- Oh, Hallie. You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

793
01:07:09,382 --> 01:07:13,216
Frank Bonito dropped by. He was
disappointed he didn't see you...

794
01:07:13,386 --> 01:07:17,652
...but he left these flowers for you,
which I think was quite considerate.

795
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:22,454
Taste and good manners impress me,
not $20 worth of flowers.

796
01:07:24,197 --> 01:07:27,792
- Had a nice day?
- Oh, I just did the town.

797
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:31,028
- Alone?
- Yes, of course. Why?

798
01:07:32,305 --> 01:07:36,435
Oliver saw you.
You were with Dove all afternoon.

799
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,745
Now, you know lying
to me, Hallie, is...

800
01:07:39,913 --> 01:07:42,814
Oh, well, perhaps maturity
will change all that.

801
01:07:42,983 --> 01:07:46,441
What do you think I'll mature into?
You?

802
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,087
I want to know what's going on
between you and that boy.

803
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:53,693
- You love that Texas dirt farmer?
- He's more than that.

804
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,193
It's gone quite far already.
You'd like to make him happy.

805
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,355
- Make all his dreams come true.
- Mine too.

806
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:02,057
- Perhaps even get married.
- Yes, even get married.

807
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,737
All right, Hallie.

808
01:08:04,904 --> 01:08:06,371
I'll be sorry to lose you.

809
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:09,440
If you think the world is your oyster,
go ahead, take it.

810
01:08:09,643 --> 01:08:13,374
But how do you think the boy will feel
when he finds out what you are?

811
01:08:13,546 --> 01:08:15,537
- He'll forgive me.
- All right, go to him.

812
01:08:15,715 --> 01:08:19,811
A girl like you has so much to offer
a man: A knife to cut his heart out.

813
01:08:19,986 --> 01:08:22,045
- I'll change.
- Of course you'll change.

814
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:24,884
Haven't you said that before?
But go on and tell him.

815
01:08:25,058 --> 01:08:27,652
Tell him about the days and nights
of Hallie Gerard.

816
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:32,230
Tell him about the mud you've rolled
in for years. Well, tell him!

817
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:38,698
Better throw this one back, Hallie.

818
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:43,767
Don't try to fool him with lies,
and don't try to fool me with lies.

819
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:46,974
- For his sake.
- Don't threaten me, Jo.

820
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,505
Why, you silly, stupid, blind...

821
01:08:49,683 --> 01:08:51,708
Do you think I'm playing
childhood games?

822
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:53,716
- If you won't tell him, I will.
- No!

823
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,411
You may be weak, but I'm not!

824
01:08:55,588 --> 01:08:59,786
I'll find your dirt farmer and I'll tell him
and that'll be the end of that!

825
01:09:02,962 --> 01:09:04,862
Oh, Hallie.

826
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:07,762
Hallie.

827
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,694
You've been dreaming.

828
01:09:11,871 --> 01:09:16,274
You've had a brief dream
of young love and candy kisses.

829
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,810
And it's all so foolish, so unreal.

830
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:22,905
Hallie.

831
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,985
If you have any feeling for that boy,
let me break it off.

832
01:09:27,153 --> 01:09:28,848
No, Jo.

833
01:09:31,725 --> 01:09:33,249
Let me end it.

834
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:37,556
Let me tell him.
I owe him that. Please?

835
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:40,763
All right, Hallie.

836
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,404
All right, Hallie.

837
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:54,647
Forty years, married to a good man.

838
01:09:54,814 --> 01:09:57,442
It's a little damp.
You can have it for two cents.

839
01:09:57,617 --> 01:09:59,710
It's also yesterday's.

840
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:04,651
Forty years of a good life.
Forty years married to a good man.

841
01:10:04,824 --> 01:10:06,883
No, thank you. I don't want it.

842
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,756
I can't accept charity.

843
01:10:10,196 --> 01:10:12,687
Here, I'll take it.

844
01:10:12,866 --> 01:10:15,528
There's something happened
yesterday I wanna read about.

845
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:17,329
I only asked two cents.

846
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:20,701
Yesterday's papers are harder
to come by. They should cost more.

847
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,136
Thank you, sir.

848
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:34,879
Step inside, ma'am.

849
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:45,554
If it ain't too much of a strain, Miss
Gerard, would you mind climbing?

850
01:10:58,244 --> 01:10:59,768
Do you like it?

851
01:11:02,081 --> 01:11:04,015
Sixteen dollars a month.

852
01:11:04,184 --> 01:11:06,152
And furnished.

853
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:10,619
Sky comes free.

854
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,018
Well?

855
01:11:17,464 --> 01:11:20,558
- It's very nice.
- A palace.

856
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:24,169
A private palace,
that's what we got now.

857
01:11:25,305 --> 01:11:28,536
You like birds? I'll get some.

858
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:31,871
I'll give them orders to do nothing
but sing all day long.

859
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,404
Somebody's coming.

860
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:39,209
Well, Mr. Linkhorn.

861
01:11:39,786 --> 01:11:41,981
Them stairs is for young people.

862
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:44,646
Well, how'd your missus
like the place?

863
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:47,019
Tell her, Hallie.

864
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:50,252
Why, I like it very much.

865
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:53,092
She's crazy about it.
She's a painter.

866
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:57,566
An artist?
I don't allow drinking or yelling.

867
01:11:58,004 --> 01:11:59,733
She's a tame one.

868
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,265
Here, $ 10 deposit.

869
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:03,807
Dove...

870
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:09,344
Well, if your missus ain't sure,
Mr. Linkhorn...

871
01:12:12,285 --> 01:12:15,948
We can look someplace else,
if this don't fit the bill.

872
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,360
No, take it. Take it, Dove.

873
01:12:24,697 --> 01:12:27,325
- There you are, sold.
- Okay.

874
01:12:27,934 --> 01:12:30,562
If you'll come with me,
I'll give you a receipt.

875
01:12:30,737 --> 01:12:32,637
We got a home now.

876
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:31,621
- Hey, Hallie!
- Yes, Dove.

877
01:13:32,465 --> 01:13:36,367
- Coming.
- It's ours now. Ours!

878
01:13:41,608 --> 01:13:44,236
I didn't actually tell her
we were married.

879
01:13:44,744 --> 01:13:47,042
She just kind of took it for granted.

880
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:49,408
I almost did too.

881
01:13:51,684 --> 01:13:53,914
You know, we could...

882
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:56,749
Well, we could move in right away.

883
01:14:00,593 --> 01:14:02,493
I love you, Hallie.

884
01:14:03,262 --> 01:14:04,991
I love you so.

885
01:14:13,373 --> 01:14:15,500
Hold me.

886
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:42,684
Hallie?

887
01:15:43,896 --> 01:15:45,420
Hallie.

888
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,391
Hey, honey.

889
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:52,927
Getting kind of eager?

890
01:15:54,974 --> 01:15:57,738
Well, she ain't there,
she's down at the bar.

891
01:15:58,177 --> 01:16:02,045
Getting close to evening now.
Birds are on the wing.

892
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,942
What're you drinking, sport?

893
01:17:29,569 --> 01:17:31,628
What are you doing?

894
01:17:32,171 --> 01:17:35,868
What is the matter? Stop it.
Damn it, stop it!

895
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,408
Dove, you're crazy!

896
01:17:38,578 --> 01:17:40,569
Come on, stop!

897
01:17:40,746 --> 01:17:42,373
Please, stop!

898
01:17:42,548 --> 01:17:44,311
Come on.

899
01:18:23,122 --> 01:18:25,920
Well, all dolled up, aren't we?

900
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:29,721
It is my brother's birthday.
We're giving him a party.

901
01:18:29,896 --> 01:18:32,831
I sure admire a nice build
on a woman.

902
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,261
Thank you.

903
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:36,594
God has been generous.

904
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,771
I'm sorry to rush you,
but we're closing early.

905
01:18:50,383 --> 01:18:53,580
Hey, Dove, it's getting late.

906
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:57,854
Oh, come on. Please get dressed.
It's a long ride.

907
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:08,225
You feel better now?

908
01:19:08,734 --> 01:19:10,463
Yeah, fine.

909
01:19:12,805 --> 01:19:14,568
I'm leaving tomorrow.

910
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:20,469
You made up your mind before
to go away.

911
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:23,046
Yeah.

912
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:30,682
I have known such a time
would come.

913
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:36,057
I have also known what I would say.

914
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:39,228
I would beg you to stay.

915
01:19:39,899 --> 01:19:42,459
On my knees, I would beg you.

916
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:46,395
I'm begging you now.

917
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:48,834
Please stay.

918
01:19:50,776 --> 01:19:52,971
Teresina, I can't.

919
01:19:54,914 --> 01:19:57,906
You don't love me, I know that.

920
01:19:59,218 --> 01:20:02,745
But in love it matters not
which loves the most.

921
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,422
I love enough for two.

922
01:20:13,632 --> 01:20:16,226
That girl, you still love her?

923
01:20:18,404 --> 01:20:21,305
You know the story
of Hosea and Gomer?

924
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:23,406
No.

925
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:25,637
In the Bible...

926
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:28,779
...Hosea fell in love with Gomer.

927
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:31,179
She was a harlot.

928
01:20:32,852 --> 01:20:35,218
They got married...

929
01:20:35,388 --> 01:20:37,754
...but she couldn't
stay away from men.

930
01:20:38,758 --> 01:20:43,491
Hosea got mad and threw her out.
Sold her into slavery.

931
01:20:43,662 --> 01:20:47,689
But he couldn't get her out of his
mind, so he went looking for her.

932
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:50,392
When he found her,
he brought her back home.

933
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:53,767
But it was no good.

934
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:56,806
Before long,
she was up to her old tricks again.

935
01:20:57,843 --> 01:20:59,834
But he loved her anyway...

936
01:21:00,813 --> 01:21:02,747
...and he couldn't give her up.

937
01:21:03,682 --> 01:21:06,150
So he took her into the wilderness...

938
01:21:06,318 --> 01:21:08,650
...away from temptation.

939
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:10,846
Away from other men.

940
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:15,354
And that's what I have to do
with Hallie.

941
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,773
Dove.

942
01:21:37,149 --> 01:21:39,117
I will pray for you.

943
01:22:12,985 --> 01:22:14,714
I'm crazy about that song.

944
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:17,515
Come on, Miss Precious,
you sing like a bird.

945
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:20,181
Hey, how about
"Rhubarb Comin' Up All Around"?

946
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:23,260
I don't like songs
with vulgar words in them.

947
01:22:23,429 --> 01:22:26,557
- I like modesty songs.
- Hey, how about this?

948
01:22:38,144 --> 01:22:39,577
Jo.

949
01:22:44,517 --> 01:22:46,644
You don't have to be here.
You're not well.

950
01:22:46,819 --> 01:22:48,377
Take your claws off me!

951
01:22:48,554 --> 01:22:51,921
I'm not going to my room. How long
can I sit there chewing my lip?

952
01:22:52,091 --> 01:22:54,286
Let's not have a scene.
We'll have a drink...

953
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:57,554
I want to sit drinking with a man,
not with you.

954
01:22:58,697 --> 01:23:01,165
- This one. He's attractive.
- You're being perverse.

955
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:04,325
I was born perverse.
Isn't that a woman's nature?

956
01:23:04,503 --> 01:23:07,734
Maybe I should let you do
what you want: Go to hell in a hack.

957
01:23:07,907 --> 01:23:12,105
Fine. As long as the driver's got
gold braid, tall, dark and handsome...

958
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:15,475
- I've had enough of this. Let's go...
- You want me to scream?

959
01:23:15,648 --> 01:23:17,115
Do you?

960
01:23:26,525 --> 01:23:28,288
Good evening.

961
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:32,021
- Why, hello.
- Would you buy me a drink?

962
01:23:32,998 --> 01:23:35,694
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

963
01:23:44,443 --> 01:23:46,377
Give me more. More. That's it.

964
01:23:46,545 --> 01:23:50,174
- What's your pleasure, sport?
- Whiskey, please.

965
01:23:50,349 --> 01:23:52,340
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No.

966
01:23:52,518 --> 01:23:53,951
Four bits.

967
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:57,720
Hallelujah.

968
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:02,850
Look who I see. If it isn't
the Reverend Dove Linkhorn.

969
01:24:03,028 --> 01:24:06,520
- Kitty.
- Kitty from Padooka, nobody else.

970
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:08,394
Got a cigarette, Dockery?

971
01:24:08,567 --> 01:24:12,833
- What are you doing here, Kitty?
- I run the candy concession.

972
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:16,837
You know, Reverend,
when you left me...

973
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:19,409
...and didn't give a damn
what happened to me...

974
01:24:19,578 --> 01:24:21,512
...I got picked up for vagrancy.

975
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,878
If it wasn't for Jo Courtney's lawyer,
I'd still be rotting in that stinking jail.

976
01:24:28,787 --> 01:24:32,120
Well, you old Bible-thumper,
what are you here for?

977
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:36,751
Looking for justice, mercy, love?

978
01:24:39,832 --> 01:24:41,959
Well, you know, Dove,
I ought to thank you.

979
01:24:42,134 --> 01:24:44,932
Because if it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be working here.

980
01:24:45,104 --> 01:24:47,095
Why are you doing this, Kitty?

981
01:24:47,273 --> 01:24:49,400
I like my work.

982
01:24:49,575 --> 01:24:53,136
Besides, you meet a better class
of people than you do on the road.

983
01:24:53,312 --> 01:24:55,439
- Kitty, I want...
- Dovey!

984
01:24:56,181 --> 01:24:57,910
Oh, you wanna see me?

985
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,846
You make an appointment with him.

986
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:02,180
I'm looking for Hallie, Kitty.

987
01:25:03,022 --> 01:25:04,785
Hallie?

988
01:25:05,424 --> 01:25:08,621
- The Hallie that works here?
- Do you know where she is? I want...

989
01:25:08,794 --> 01:25:12,230
Oh, Dovey, you'd better get in line.

990
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:14,559
Are you a surgeon?

991
01:25:15,868 --> 01:25:19,304
That explains your strong,
beautiful hands.

992
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:22,770
Tell me, what's it like
to be a doctor's wife?

993
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:25,409
I don't know. I don't have one.

994
01:25:26,111 --> 01:25:29,979
You're certainly an unusual girl
to find in this sort of place.

995
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:32,508
You ever been married?

996
01:25:34,486 --> 01:25:36,078
Almost.

997
01:25:36,655 --> 01:25:39,988
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

998
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,318
Your hand's cold.

999
01:25:44,330 --> 01:25:48,027
You're a hard-working doctor, you
came here to forget your troubles...

1000
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,829
...and all you get is an icy hand.
You should ask for your money back.

1001
01:25:52,004 --> 01:25:53,972
I'm satisfied.

1002
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:02,371
Thank you, sir.

1003
01:26:03,615 --> 01:26:06,846
You know something?
I wish I hadn't met you here.

1004
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:10,819
As they say, the breaks of life.
Good night.

1005
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:19,855
Hello, Hallie.

1006
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:33,637
Jo wants to see you, honey.

1007
01:26:49,795 --> 01:26:53,356
Well, what are you going to do,
just sit there looking at me?

1008
01:26:53,532 --> 01:26:55,090
If you let me.

1009
01:26:55,267 --> 01:26:58,065
Only money buys attention here.

1010
01:27:01,173 --> 01:27:02,902
Hallie, I...

1011
01:27:04,743 --> 01:27:06,802
Suppose I said...

1012
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,808
Suppose I said we forget
the past...

1013
01:27:12,184 --> 01:27:14,516
...and start from scratch again.

1014
01:27:19,658 --> 01:27:21,455
I need you, Hallie.

1015
01:27:22,294 --> 01:27:25,991
- So does every man who comes here.
- Didn't you hear me? I need you.

1016
01:27:26,165 --> 01:27:29,293
I'm past reclaiming, Dove.
Don't you understand?

1017
01:27:29,468 --> 01:27:33,700
If you've got the price, you're
welcome. If not, there is the front door.

1018
01:27:37,176 --> 01:27:38,871
All right.

1019
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:42,813
I'm joining the bandwagon.

1020
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:45,711
Well, if it's convincing you want...

1021
01:27:56,695 --> 01:28:00,187
- When did you first meet him?
- We come from Texas together.

1022
01:28:00,365 --> 01:28:02,128
He brought you from Texas?

1023
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:06,965
He didn't exactly bring me, Miss Jo.
We come in on the back of a truck.

1024
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:09,266
You crossed the state line?

1025
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:12,467
How else you get
from Texas to Louisiana?

1026
01:28:13,145 --> 01:28:16,546
- Why, Miss Jo?
- I just like to know all about my girls...

1027
01:28:16,715 --> 01:28:19,946
...their backgrounds, their friends.
That's all.

1028
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:22,814
Now, go on back
and cheer up the guests.

1029
01:28:23,455 --> 01:28:24,786
Thank you.

1030
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:46,203
Some men like music.

1031
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,108
Hallie.

1032
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:01,486
Come on, I'll take you out of here.
I'll help you pack.

1033
01:30:01,653 --> 01:30:03,280
Dove, think.

1034
01:30:03,455 --> 01:30:08,415
- Thinking's no good, only feeling is.
- Feeling can be a trap. Please, think.

1035
01:30:08,594 --> 01:30:10,186
About what?

1036
01:30:11,229 --> 01:30:13,129
About the way I've lived, what I am.

1037
01:30:13,298 --> 01:30:15,732
It cannot be healed overnight,
a thing like that.

1038
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:17,596
A thing like what?

1039
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:19,600
A thing like being...

1040
01:30:20,272 --> 01:30:23,708
Oh, you see, Dove,
right away you cringe.

1041
01:30:24,476 --> 01:30:26,239
The past don't mean a thing.

1042
01:30:26,411 --> 01:30:30,006
Only the future. If we don't grab it
while we can we'll never have it.

1043
01:30:30,182 --> 01:30:34,585
I'll do it. You get a cab and wait for me
at the back gate around the corner.

1044
01:30:34,753 --> 01:30:38,280
I'll be there, I swear it.
Nothing can stop me now.

1045
01:30:40,826 --> 01:30:43,420
- Half an hour.
- I'll be there.

1046
01:30:55,674 --> 01:30:57,938
Wait here in case I need you.

1047
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:06,710
Well.

1048
01:31:06,885 --> 01:31:10,184
You're not planning on carrying
all those yourself, are you?

1049
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:13,017
- Don't stop me, Jo.
- You mean you're really leaving?

1050
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:15,989
This isn't some joke?
Yes, with your farm boy, I'll bet.

1051
01:31:16,161 --> 01:31:19,722
I saw him leave. But he's coming back,
and he'll carry them for you.

1052
01:31:19,898 --> 01:31:23,061
Porter, lover,
general romantic dream.

1053
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:24,497
- Oliver!
- Jo, please!

1054
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:28,902
Unpack your things. You're not going.
This place needs you. I need you.

1055
01:31:29,074 --> 01:31:31,338
Watch her. Don't let anyone in here.

1056
01:31:48,593 --> 01:31:49,661
- What's happening, Jo?
- Hallie. She's packing.

1057
01:31:49,661 --> 01:31:51,026
- What's happening, Jo?
- Hallie. She's packing.

1058
01:31:51,196 --> 01:31:52,993
You mean she's going away?

1059
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:55,895
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

1060
01:31:56,068 --> 01:31:58,434
No.

1061
01:31:58,603 --> 01:32:01,470
No. Things are still
going to be the same.

1062
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,302
That's what you said
before the accident.

1063
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:07,309
Before they took away my legs.

1064
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:09,811
Are things still the same?

1065
01:32:09,981 --> 01:32:12,575
Am I still your husband?

1066
01:32:18,457 --> 01:32:20,357
Let them go!

1067
01:32:24,563 --> 01:32:27,430
I know what's going on
inside them.

1068
01:32:28,066 --> 01:32:31,035
I know what it's like
loving somebody...

1069
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:33,797
...and not being able
to do anything about it.

1070
01:32:36,108 --> 01:32:37,700
Love.

1071
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:40,669
Can any man love a woman
for herself...

1072
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:44,441
...without wanting her body
for his own pleasure?

1073
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:47,181
Love is understanding and sharing...

1074
01:32:47,352 --> 01:32:51,220
...enjoying the beauty of life
without the reek of lust.

1075
01:32:51,723 --> 01:32:53,714
Don't talk to me about love!

1076
01:32:54,059 --> 01:32:56,527
What do you know?
What does that young fool know?

1077
01:32:56,695 --> 01:32:59,129
What does any man know?

1078
01:33:08,373 --> 01:33:09,738
Jo?

1079
01:33:10,909 --> 01:33:13,878
Forget everything that I just said.

1080
01:33:14,846 --> 01:33:17,041
Just being near you, that...

1081
01:33:17,482 --> 01:33:19,814
That's enough for me, honey.

1082
01:33:26,024 --> 01:33:30,051
I'm going to call Frank Bonito. Tell
Dockery I want to see him right away.

1083
01:33:39,204 --> 01:33:41,104
What time is it?

1084
01:33:42,107 --> 01:33:44,007
Wait here for me.

1085
01:34:22,581 --> 01:34:24,572
Buster, you're in real trouble.

1086
01:34:31,857 --> 01:34:33,347
What is this?
What's going on?

1087
01:34:33,525 --> 01:34:36,961
Turn around, sonny.
I don't like talking to your back.

1088
01:34:37,128 --> 01:34:39,619
- Who is that man?
- A very good friend of mine.

1089
01:34:39,798 --> 01:34:41,891
He's also very important downtown.

1090
01:34:42,067 --> 01:34:46,265
- And who are you?
- Jo Courtney. I run this place.

1091
01:34:46,438 --> 01:34:48,338
This the man?

1092
01:34:49,274 --> 01:34:51,469
Ever see this girl before?

1093
01:34:52,544 --> 01:34:53,943
Yeah. Why?

1094
01:34:54,913 --> 01:34:57,643
She's made serious charges
against you.

1095
01:34:57,816 --> 01:35:01,047
There's a law against transporting
minors across the state line.

1096
01:35:01,353 --> 01:35:03,583
Plus a little matter of statutory rape.

1097
01:35:03,755 --> 01:35:06,622
So you see, Mr. Linkhorn,
you're in considerable trouble.

1098
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:11,319
Conviction on these charges means
5-and-20 years, that's a healthy rap.

1099
01:35:11,496 --> 01:35:13,589
What are you trying to do?

1100
01:35:13,765 --> 01:35:16,290
We're trying to help you, buddy.

1101
01:35:17,569 --> 01:35:19,469
But I never touched her.

1102
01:35:19,638 --> 01:35:22,004
You'll tell them that,
won't you, Kitty?

1103
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:26,710
She's an orphan.
And she trusted you.

1104
01:35:26,878 --> 01:35:31,611
Are you willing to gamble 25 years
of your life on what Kitty will say...

1105
01:35:31,783 --> 01:35:35,082
...to a jury of Southern gentlemen?

1106
01:35:42,027 --> 01:35:43,892
What do you want?

1107
01:35:44,562 --> 01:35:47,395
I want you to forget
you ever knew Hallie.

1108
01:35:47,565 --> 01:35:49,396
I'll pay your fare back to Arroyo...

1109
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:53,094
...and Mr. Bonito will drop all charges,
if you leave.

1110
01:35:58,143 --> 01:36:00,771
Who made you boss of this world?

1111
01:36:00,946 --> 01:36:03,073
Maybe you can order them around.

1112
01:36:03,248 --> 01:36:06,809
Maybe you can ride herd
on a bunch of poor, ignorant girls...

1113
01:36:06,985 --> 01:36:10,546
...but not me. No, ma'am,
you can't tell me what to do.

1114
01:36:10,722 --> 01:36:12,815
Go ahead,
you try putting me behind bars.

1115
01:36:13,692 --> 01:36:17,093
But there ain't walls thick enough
to lock in the truth.

1116
01:36:17,262 --> 01:36:18,388
I never touched her.

1117
01:36:18,697 --> 01:36:22,895
Look here, I'm trying to keep you out
of jail. Now, leave! Get out of town!

1118
01:36:23,068 --> 01:36:25,093
Okay, but Hallie comes with me.

1119
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:29,604
No, don't! Jo, promise me
you won't take him to jail...

1120
01:36:29,774 --> 01:36:33,005
...that you won't hurt him,
and I'll make him leave.

1121
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:36,511
He'll go and I'll never see him again.
Promise me.

1122
01:36:36,982 --> 01:36:38,574
Have I ever lied to you?

1123
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:41,048
Well, I'm not going to start now.

1124
01:36:41,219 --> 01:36:44,677
If your farm boy is out of the state
by noon tomorrow, without you...

1125
01:36:44,856 --> 01:36:46,380
...nothing will happen to him.

1126
01:36:46,558 --> 01:36:49,823
But if he isn't, if he tries to come
back here and see you...

1127
01:36:49,995 --> 01:36:54,261
...then Mr. Bonito will see
that he goes in for 25 years.

1128
01:37:00,372 --> 01:37:02,772
Do as the lady says, huh?

1129
01:37:04,376 --> 01:37:07,038
- What happens to you?
- I don't think I care.

1130
01:37:07,746 --> 01:37:09,611
Well, I do,
and you're coming with me.

1131
01:37:09,781 --> 01:37:11,715
No, don't.

1132
01:37:18,723 --> 01:37:19,712
Oh, Dove.

1133
01:37:19,891 --> 01:37:23,759
Hallie, get up. Get him out of here!
Get up!

1134
01:37:30,969 --> 01:37:32,630
Kitty.

1135
01:37:36,775 --> 01:37:38,675
Stay here.

1136
01:38:14,279 --> 01:38:16,179
Let me have him!

1137
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:25,419
Now you're gonna get it good.

1138
01:38:53,818 --> 01:38:55,786
Give me a hand.

1139
01:40:02,187 --> 01:40:03,916
Dove.

1140
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:06,815
Dove.

1141
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:12,455
I'm gonna take you to a doctor.

1142
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,997
- Teresina's café.
- Dove, you gotta have a doctor.

1143
01:40:16,167 --> 01:40:18,533
Teresina's café.

1144
01:40:33,384 --> 01:40:36,751
He needs plenty of sleep.
I've given him a sedative.

1145
01:40:36,921 --> 01:40:38,650
How bad is he, doctor?

1146
01:40:38,823 --> 01:40:42,554
He took a terrible beating, but he's
young and strong. He'll be all right.

1147
01:40:42,727 --> 01:40:46,458
He keeps calling for Hallie.
Who is that?

1148
01:40:47,432 --> 01:40:49,400
A friend.

1149
01:40:49,567 --> 01:40:51,865
I'll have another look at him
in the morning.

1150
01:40:52,036 --> 01:40:53,833
I have to get back.

1151
01:40:54,005 --> 01:40:55,529
Wait.

1152
01:40:57,875 --> 01:41:01,311
This Hallie, you bring her here.

1153
01:41:01,813 --> 01:41:03,747
I can't.

1154
01:41:05,917 --> 01:41:10,411
You don't know what you're asking.
They'd kill me if I did.

1155
01:41:10,588 --> 01:41:13,182
You want to see him beat up again?

1156
01:41:13,358 --> 01:41:15,758
Do you think this will stop him? No.

1157
01:41:15,927 --> 01:41:19,795
He will get well and go back there
again and they will finish him.

1158
01:41:20,665 --> 01:41:22,530
Bring her here.

1159
01:41:23,234 --> 01:41:25,361
I don't know.

1160
01:41:26,204 --> 01:41:28,536
I don't know what to do.

1161
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:30,973
Please.

1162
01:42:22,994 --> 01:42:25,428
What are you doing
out here, sugar?

1163
01:42:25,596 --> 01:42:28,258
Well, I gotta powder my nose.

1164
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,900
What's the matter with in there?

1165
01:42:34,072 --> 01:42:37,667
Do you mind if I do it
in my own boudoir?

1166
01:42:37,842 --> 01:42:41,869
I mean, you know,
some things call for privacy.

1167
01:42:57,095 --> 01:42:58,687
Hallie.

1168
01:43:14,445 --> 01:43:16,106
Get out.

1169
01:43:17,148 --> 01:43:18,706
He's beat up.

1170
01:43:18,883 --> 01:43:20,851
Dove, they smashed him up.

1171
01:43:21,018 --> 01:43:23,043
You're lying, Kitty.

1172
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:31,124
No. No, Hallie.

1173
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:36,731
I saw them downstairs.

1174
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:39,836
It was Oliver and Schmidt
and Dockery, they beat him up.

1175
01:43:40,004 --> 01:43:41,665
- It's bad...
- You're a liar.

1176
01:43:41,839 --> 01:43:46,173
I was with him. I'm telling you, Hallie,
he's all busted up.

1177
01:43:46,344 --> 01:43:49,507
There was a doctor. He's been
bleeding and he's asking for you.

1178
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,170
Where is he?

1179
01:43:51,349 --> 01:43:54,841
It's 38 River Street.

1180
01:43:58,623 --> 01:44:01,683
Wait a minute, Hallie,
Oliver's downstairs.

1181
01:44:11,335 --> 01:44:12,962
All right.

1182
01:44:14,205 --> 01:44:17,902
Honey, he's always loved you.
He wouldn't touch me ever.

1183
01:44:18,075 --> 01:44:19,975
He needs you.

1184
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:24,274
Okay, let me go first.

1185
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:47,164
Anybody ever tell you
you had cocker spaniel eyes?

1186
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:12,494
Hi, Reba. How's tricks?

1187
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:15,689
Some nights it doesn't pay
to get out of bed.

1188
01:45:21,172 --> 01:45:23,265
Why, you dirty...

1189
01:45:34,118 --> 01:45:38,487
All right, knock it off!
Knock it off. Knock it off.

1190
01:46:16,627 --> 01:46:18,288
Oliver.

1191
01:46:18,462 --> 01:46:22,023
Oh, I'm sorry about the fight, Oliver.
I don't know what happened.

1192
01:46:22,199 --> 01:46:25,066
That Reba makes me so mad.

1193
01:46:25,636 --> 01:46:28,503
Well, you know how I am.

1194
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:29,799
Yeah, I know, sugar.

1195
01:46:31,342 --> 01:46:33,742
I hope I didn't hurt her.

1196
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:39,443
I hope you didn't hurt yourself.

1197
01:46:41,852 --> 01:46:43,843
I'm not exactly looking my best,
am I?

1198
01:46:46,958 --> 01:46:49,552
I think you look just fine.

1199
01:47:08,045 --> 01:47:10,343
My garter slipped.

1200
01:47:21,926 --> 01:47:24,793
You wanna fix my strap, Oliver?

1201
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:29,723
Where's Miss Jo?

1202
01:47:31,535 --> 01:47:33,628
She's waiting.

1203
01:47:33,804 --> 01:47:35,965
Oh, yeah?

1204
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:38,472
What she waiting for?

1205
01:47:39,176 --> 01:47:42,873
For me to come back
with the right answers.

1206
01:47:43,047 --> 01:47:45,515
Now, what are you talking about?

1207
01:47:47,852 --> 01:47:50,582
Well, it seems that Hallie's
been misplaced.

1208
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:54,282
Oh, you know where Hallie is.
Hallie went out with Mr. Bonito.

1209
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:56,289
Didn't she?

1210
01:47:59,163 --> 01:48:00,892
Didn't she...?

1211
01:48:01,732 --> 01:48:02,994
Where is she, sugar?

1212
01:48:15,613 --> 01:48:17,774
I'm here, Dove.

1213
01:48:18,783 --> 01:48:21,843
Sleep. Just sleep.

1214
01:48:41,572 --> 01:48:45,872
Listen, I'll keep them from coming in.
You call the police.

1215
01:49:07,264 --> 01:49:09,562
- I knew you'd come.
- Did you?

1216
01:49:09,734 --> 01:49:11,167
In a way, I've been waiting.

1217
01:49:12,036 --> 01:49:14,504
- Come on, I'm taking you home.
- I'm not going.

1218
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:19,339
- Don't be difficult.
- It's finished, Jo. All finished.

1219
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:21,506
You're talking like a child again.

1220
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,739
Perhaps, but I'm not going back.
There is too much hate in me...

1221
01:49:24,915 --> 01:49:27,247
...for you and your friends,
even more for myself.

1222
01:49:27,518 --> 01:49:29,383
- You're coming back.
- The hell I am.

1223
01:49:29,553 --> 01:49:34,752
- I'm not afraid of you anymore, Jo.
- You do what Jo tells you, honey.

1224
01:49:34,925 --> 01:49:39,123
She picked you up from nowhere,
you tramp.

1225
01:49:39,897 --> 01:49:41,489
Go ahead. Do me a favor.

1226
01:49:42,133 --> 01:49:44,693
You're such a fool, Hallie.

1227
01:49:44,869 --> 01:49:48,100
It's so easy to make you come back.

1228
01:49:48,272 --> 01:49:49,864
Find him.

1229
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:08,691
He's in here.

1230
01:50:11,095 --> 01:50:12,858
Who are you?

1231
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:14,964
This is my place.

1232
01:50:19,170 --> 01:50:22,071
So that's what you need.
A drifter, a bum.

1233
01:50:22,807 --> 01:50:25,674
Leave him alone, Jo.
You've done enough to him.

1234
01:50:25,843 --> 01:50:28,676
This is the woman
that owns this place.

1235
01:50:29,146 --> 01:50:30,977
Hallie.

1236
01:50:31,415 --> 01:50:32,814
Yes, darling.

1237
01:50:32,983 --> 01:50:35,474
- Hallie, get out of here.
- Jo, please!

1238
01:50:35,653 --> 01:50:37,587
Come on, sonny. Come on.

1239
01:50:38,189 --> 01:50:39,986
- Hallie, get out of here.
- No.

1240
01:50:40,524 --> 01:50:41,786
Come on.

1241
01:50:41,959 --> 01:50:44,086
Raise that aching head
of yours right here.

1242
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:46,593
- That's enough, Oliver.
- Right here!

1243
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,170
Hallie?

1244
01:51:04,348 --> 01:51:06,145
Hallie!

1245
01:51:07,284 --> 01:51:09,980
- Get Jo out of here! Get her out.
- No! No!

1246
