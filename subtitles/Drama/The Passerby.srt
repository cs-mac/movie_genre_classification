1
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,580
A camera I picked up by chance
one day changed my life.

2
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:56,510
Resignation letter
Name: Kim Jiwan

3
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,520
It's not too late. You should
give it another thought.

4
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,540
RAINBOW

5
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,910
I thought I could start making films
right after I had resigned.

6
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,810
A wishful thinking.

7
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,620
Green light is on.
Now you can cross.

8
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,440
Crossing is dangerous.
Please wait for the next light.

9
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,140
It's been 5 years I've been
taking up any jobs in this field.

10
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,440
At last I have my own business card.

11
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,640
I've talked to the investors.

12
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,150
Either action or comedy.
The genre needs to be clear.

13
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,860
Anyway black comedy won't work.

14
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,560
This part of your script is weak.

15
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,970
It's relevant to the conflict.

16
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,770
So we need to redo the plot.

17
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,570
Otherwise financing will be difficult.

18
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,880
What do you think, Director Kim?

19
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,930
- Mom.
- What's up?

20
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
We've got lots of ants at home.

21
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,830
- Ask dad to catch them.
- He's asleep.

22
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,230
Use the tape and crush them with it.

23
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,140
Yeah.

24
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,740
- Where are you?
- In the office.

25
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,550
- Still working?
- Yup.

26
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,250
Si young said to buy
some tape on your way.

27
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,550
Ok.

28
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,570
Hi, mom.

29
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,170
- Where's dad?
- In the bedroom.

30
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,390
How's your work?

31
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,700
Not bad.

32
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,800
You've been saying
that for five years.

33
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,010
Nothing's been done
since you quit your job.

34
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,310
How much longer
will your script take?

35
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,910
Until it's done.

36
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,830
My mom's an idiot

37
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,340
- 20 million won!
- 10 million won!

38
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,750
This is a story about a woman,
who had once hit rock bottom.

39
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,340
300,000 won!

40
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,450
- 250,000 won!
- 150,000 won!

41
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,460
Zero!

42
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,670
Turn the damn light off.

43
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,490
Director Kim, how about
one more revision?

44
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,090
Sorry. I can't do it anymore.

45
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,400
I've been working on
this script for three years.

46
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,100
That's 15 drafts till now! Fifteen!

47
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,910
You promised me you'd start casting.

48
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,210
Please start casting.

49
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,810
Well, it's not my decision to make.

50
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:45,720
If we work hard... Like a beaver,
we will make it someday.

51
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,030
- So...
- I don't want to live like a beaver.

52
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,130
Then let's put it on hold.

53
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,040
- What do you mean "on hold?"
- We should store the script away.

54
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,040
You think it is some wine?

55
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,060
- Hi, Hojun.
- Oh, Jiwan.

56
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,760
- Director.
- Yes.

57
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,160
So, what I meant was that
my script is commercial, okay?

58
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,760
Yes. Please get in!

59
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,290
Hey, Hojun.

60
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,190
Jiwan, I'm so sorry about earlier.
It's an important meeting.

61
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,390
- That's alright.
- How's your movie going?

62
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,800
- Pretty good. We'll start shooting soon.
- That's great.

63
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,100
I feel terrible if my film
went ahead of you.

64
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,300
Sorry, I have to go!

65
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,510
So, did you quit your job?

66
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:24,110
Forget it. Gifts? Passion?
It's all nothing without luck.

67
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:30,230
You focus too much on only one thing.
Try a new approach!

68
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,820
But there was a story
I wanted to talk about.

69
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,630
What was it?

70
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,840
Ants. A story about ants.

71
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,240
I'm scared of them.

72
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,080
Trying to burn down
the whole house?

73
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,680
Look at this!

74
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,690
All this, for a damn movie!

75
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,890
Go to the theater instead!

76
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,620
Hurt? It'd be so cool if the bruise
looks just like a baseball.

77
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,710
- Hey!
- I've thrown some curve balls.

78
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:27,040
Ah, welcome to Otaku's room

79
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,950
My mom's belly is
the size of Mt. Bukhan

80
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:42,160
Ah, we are one weird family

81
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:51,570
Mom doesn't have a movie to shoot,
but she calls herself a 'director'

82
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,070
And because of her, dad
doesn't go to the theater

83
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:06,580
Mom won't even take a shower now

84
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:19,490
Oh, she's... Walking on two
feet An Australopithecus

85
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,710
Mom, you're being a real bum lately.

86
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm waiting for your movie,
but all you do is sleeping.

87
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,830
Cast me when you start shooting.

88
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,040
- I want to be Passerby No. 3.
- Why Passerby #3?

89
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,440
I just like the number three.

90
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,340
But you must pay me.

91
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,140
Cabbages. Banana for sale!

92
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,570
I used to interview bands
to make a film about them.

93
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,180
And I realized that their struggle
was the same as mine.

94
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,000
A band plays on stage.

95
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,930
Scene 40. At a concert hall.

96
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,730
Eunju is looking at singer on stage.

97
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,240
Her body is like a sound booster.

98
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,640
- It's boring. Really sucks.
- Hey!

99
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,050
Buy me an electric guitar
if you seal the contract.

100
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,240
What about moving
to a bigger house?

101
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,840
I gave up on that.
Buy me one, okay?

102
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,460
Alright.

103
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,770
- What are you doing?
- Working.

104
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,870
On what, this time?

105
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,480
You're not going to the office lately.

106
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,080
Did you get fired?

107
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:19,100
You dunno nothin' You dunno nothin'
Nothin' damn it...

108
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,010
You have to work tomorrow.
How could you drink so much?

109
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,610
Work?

110
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,720
You can go instead of me.

111
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,820
Ha, I want to quit, too.

112
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,600
It's me.

113
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,000
- Did you read it?
- Yup.

114
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,200
How was it?

115
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,000
Not bad. I see you've
been working hard.

116
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,910
You can tell? I saw a pig in my dream.
Exactly, it was pig's feet.

117
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a lucky dream.

118
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,010
Wake up, dummy!
You want some pork hock?

119
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,120
So hot.

120
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,220
Last year was worst.

121
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,820
So, what did you write at
the previous company?

122
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,240
I arranged a nice room
especially for you.

123
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,140
It's really big!
Is this really all to myself?

124
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,950
You deserve it.
Here, this is the schedule.

125
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,760
From July to December, script revisions.
Casting by next February.

126
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,260
Pre-production begins in March,
and the shoot starts in May.

127
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,660
Look over it and give
me your opinion.

128
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,260
- Ok.
- Oh and...

129
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,660
Your business card.

130
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,270
- Everything's so fast here.
- Fast is good. Time is money.

131
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,880
- Let's make this happen, OK?
- Yes.

132
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,290
I see you have an eye for guitars.

133
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,800
I'll get you this when my
movie hits the jackpot!

134
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,110
Getting a job and buying
it myself will be faster.

135
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,940
Turn it down!

136
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,670
Schedule

137
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,270
Come in.

138
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,280
- How do you do?
- Yes?

139
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,580
I'm a director, Ahn Changnam.
I use the room next door.

140
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,680
You directed the film,
Myung-ja's Friday, right?

141
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,780
Ya, that's me.

142
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,380
Please have a seat.

143
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,790
Use this up quick,
before the movie's dropped.

144
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,100
- Excuse me?
- What the hell am I saying...

145
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,000
I heard your script is good.
Show it to me.

146
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,900
Sure.

147
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,710
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

148
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,120
- He must be your son.
- That's right.

149
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,320
I'm expecting a baby in three months.
Saw the ultrasounds.

150
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,920
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

151
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,830
- See you again.
- Okay, bye.

152
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,650
Feel free to stop by
my office anytime!

153
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,860
Okay!

154
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,380
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

155
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,180
1st draft

156
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,770
2nd draft

157
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,080
3rd draft

158
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,180
4th draft

159
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,190
5th draft

160
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,690
Just 5th drafts, and shooting!

161
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,380
The hero spent his youth
in a detention center.

162
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,390
He served time for
murdering his own father.

163
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,690
With this secret behind,
he works as a deliver boy.

164
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,990
One day, he finds a guitar.

165
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,500
And he becomes
a successful musician?

166
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,200
- You get the picture!
- Not bad.

167
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,400
No, not a detention center.
It's too depressing.

168
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,110
Hero has got to be from the middle class.
Audience wants something more positive.

169
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,720
Then, his mother is a doctor.
Father is a guitarist killed himself.

170
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,720
Oh, nice! And he has gift
for memorizing music.

171
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,520
- Sense of perfect pitch?
- Bingo!

172
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,530
Way to go.

173
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,220
- How about age?
- Fifteen.

174
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,430
- Not good.
- Then, eighteen.

175
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,230
The movie has to draw 2 million tickets.
So make him in twenties.

176
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,440
Yes?

177
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,950
- Hello.
- Hi, Director Ahn.

178
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,750
Please have a seat.
Just a few more left.

179
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,760
This room is so empty.

180
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,960
This is the third company I've joined.

181
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,070
I didn't bring my stuff.
I never know when I'll be fired.

182
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,770
But you've already
made your debut.

183
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,780
Yes, but making the second
one isn't so easy.

184
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:26,080
- I never really see you working.
- I never revise my scripts.

185
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,780
Why not?

186
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,090
People say I shouldn't
'cos it'll make it worse.

187
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,890
I've edited it only once in a year.

188
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,490
It's better to build up
strength during that time.

189
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,800
You need to have good stamina
after the shoot begins.

190
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,600
- Here.
- Ok, thanks.

191
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,610
So, how's your script coming along?

192
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,220
- Oh, I have to make it more commercial.
- Commercial?

193
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:10,630
For new director, the most crucial thing is...
bringing out your own color.

194
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,330
Genuine color.

195
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,720
What are you doing?

196
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,420
I was sketching the opening scene.

197
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,930
Alright, Director.
Let's go watch the show.

198
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,470
People jumping around.

199
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,770
People sitting still.

200
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,980
People walking around.

201
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,090
Everywhere was the stage.

202
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,580
Hi, honey.

203
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,190
- What is this?
- Musical score.

204
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,890
- This is a score?
- Yeah, I found it.

205
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,500
My goodness...

206
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,210
I want to give it a try.
A story about a rainbow.
Title: Rainbow

207
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,910
- Sure?
- Yes, I am.

208
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,540
One is lonely.

209
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,440
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Ms. Choi.

210
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,640
So, how's my script?

211
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,350
It was quite interesting!

212
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,750
Combining drama with fantasy
was unique. Nice job.

213
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,050
Hello.

214
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

215
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,760
The two are trying.

216
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,690
I'm not really sure.
It's been two months already.

217
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,990
Sir... Mrs. Kim hasn't
grasped the concept yet.

218
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,000
Director's intention seems...

219
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:04,300
- Sir, the tone of the movie...
- What was the tone you...

220
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,300
- Well, that's not my decision to make.
- Of course not, sir.

221
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,400
And yet, the plot's conflict
needs to be clear.

222
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,310
- Oh, the conflict is...
- Yes, it's unclear.

223
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,110
Also, in terms of marketing,
this movie is tough.
When there are three people...

224
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,620
Thought about how the audience
will see this movie?
It always becomes political with three people.

225
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,930
Sir, Mrs. Kim still lacks commerciality.

226
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,830
So I'll do my best...

227
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,630
Are you insisting that we proceed?

228
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,930
Shall we try a different approach?

229
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,740
Well... I think this project
needs a basic makeover.

230
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,940
Do you mean...

231
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,350
What are you doing?

232
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,360
Can you make a genre movie?

233
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:10,370
- Genre? The genre is fantasy.
- Which does not work in Korea!

234
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,670
- But I can do whatever...
- Stop it!

235
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,570
You're overestimating the investors.

236
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,380
They make decisions based on statistics.
Think they'll understand your script?

237
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,780
Belief is more important than numbers.

238
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,880
Look Director Kim. Think straight.

239
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,790
Nobody understands
this psychotic fantasy!

240
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,590
Will you making this film alone?
Forget this whole hallucination.

241
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,790
Hallucination? I really saw it.

242
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,100
Stop pushing me with
your shitty imagination!

243
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,500
Shitty imagination?

244
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,700
Sorry about that.

245
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,910
Want to know what the reality is?

246
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,420
Go on with "Rainbow",
and you'll be gone forever.

247
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,930
If you want a touch of
"reality," go ahead.

248
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,630
Director Kim.

249
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,440
Do you want to hit
rock bottom again?

250
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,830
Are you so great?

251
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,640
You haven't even
made your debut yet.

252
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,040
Got any idea what's going on lately?

253
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:39,050
We are talking about 'survival.'
It's a war out there.

254
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,060
And that time table is
the life span I spared you!

255
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,770
It's all up to you.

256
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,270
From today, forget about "Rainbow".

257
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,290
How to Write a Script

258
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:26,000
"There has to be an event
within ten minutes."

259
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,110
"And the characters
have to transform."

260
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,510
"Heroes must have a definite goal."

261
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,930
"But does everyone live with
a clear goal and motive?"

262
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,540
"A scriptwriter's promise
to the audience is weak."

263
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,040
Oh, trust me!

264
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,340
Once you pass this boring part,
I will give you thrills!

265
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,950
"Every action must have
an explicit reason."

266
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,950
Damn it! There 'ARE'
actions with no reason.

267
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,670
Mom, I joined the band at school.

268
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,670
You did?

269
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,980
My seniors are nice guys,
they don't smoke.

270
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,180
Good for you.

271
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,890
We'll throw a concert.
But I won't be a part of it.

272
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,890
- Why not?
- I have stage phobia.

273
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,400
You need to overcome that.
Shall I go see you practice?

274
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,600
Mom, don't even think it.

275
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,110
- Why?
- You embarrass me.

276
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,520
Hey!

277
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,510
Shit...

278
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,420
I've never seen anything
like this before.

279
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,320
Me either. I just liked
the first few cords.

280
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,230
No lyrics.

281
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,930
I'll come up with one.

282
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,030
These cords are way over your head.
Can you play this, huh?

283
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:25,740
Just stick to your practice,
you little twirp!

284
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:35,350
Look at this. Must be new brand.
How much was this shit?

285
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,550
- Hey, I'll keep this one!
- Give it back!

286
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,270
Hey! How dare you look
straight back at me!

287
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,970
When you're talking to me?

288
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,580
It's the forth button.

289
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,870
Don't you fuckin' hear me?

290
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,780
Have you gone deaf?

291
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,800
Bloody hell! You're just
a backup! Go practice!

292
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,500
You can't even sing,
you useless piece of shit!

293
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:34,010
I heard the film industry is bad these days.
Is your company ok?

294
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,810
The company's holding up fine.

295
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,110
That's good to hear.

296
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,820
But are you okay, too?

297
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,330
Hey, you're home.

298
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,240
Have you picked the song yet?

299
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,550
- Where's your guitar?
- I lent it to someone.

300
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,150
And not taken away from you?

301
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,150
Piss off!

302
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,960
Si young, why are you
talking to me like that?

303
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,860
What's wrong? I'm in my teens.

304
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,960
Adolescence comes with a hostile,
rebellious attitude!

305
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,660
How could you say
that to your mom?

306
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,670
Yes! Rebelling is a privilege
for distressed teenagers!

307
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,970
You... You... Forget that
I changed your diapers?

308
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,880
How can you do this!

309
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,880
What's going on?

310
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,980
Nothing.

311
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,910
Would you look up my script?

312
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,000
That's fine.

313
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,610
- How's it going?
- I'm printing out new script.

314
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,720
You are always working so fast.

315
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:25,120
It was your request.

316
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:35,330
You know what?
Well... Let's give up on this.

317
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,230
Pardon?

318
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,140
Do you know 'Cultwo Pictures'?

319
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,450
They've already launched
a project with the same theme.

320
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,950
They've even finished casting.
All top stars.

321
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,260
Nothing's working out for me lately.

322
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,460
But still, there must be
something different.

323
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,760
The story's much the same.

324
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,480
So I gave another thought to
that "Rainbow" script of yours.

325
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,280
And it might actually work.

326
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,090
You said it won't work
with the investors.

327
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,090
Well, I can tell you
from my experience.

328
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,000
Nothing goes as expected.

329
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,200
Who knows? It might
all come out differently.

330
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,000
We have to be the first one.
Before someone else does it.

331
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,300
I heard of this band, 'Rainbow'.
Let's find them.

332
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,610
Big Star is born.

333
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,320
My mom's an idiot

334
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,830
Rainbow

335
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,370
I'm the guitarist, Park Jiwon.

336
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,770
Song Namhyeon, on base.

337
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,780
Noh Yunan, on the drum.

338
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,180
My name is Kim Jiwan.

339
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,080
Nice to meet you.

340
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,880
I saw your show on the Internet.

341
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,690
I hope you're not offended by this...
Isn't it a show rather than music?

342
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,190
You must've watched some old stuff.

343
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:25,100
I used to smash up and reassemble
guitars over and over again.

344
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,200
But now I can't anymore.

345
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,110
This crazy bastard
became a grown-up.

346
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,910
Where do you practice?

347
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,510
We used to practice
on the street mostly.

348
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,520
Sometimes we'd sneak
into the lecture hall.

349
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,320
We used to argue
with the guard for that.

350
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:53,320
But it wasn't all that bad.
Yeah, it was alright.

351
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,630
When we first came to Seoul,
we performed here.

352
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:04,130
We used to get paid 1,000 won by each person.
And there were times we had no one.

353
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,240
But we took it as a chance to practice.

354
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,740
Put this in your bag.

355
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,950
Creativity Booster

356
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,950
Being a film producer sucks, too.

357
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:31,170
It does. Not so different
from the service jobs.

358
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:37,570
And yet, what job isn't
tough in this world?

359
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,980
We can do this.

360
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,880
I believe in you.

361
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:53,490
Just write whatever you want.
Your true color is most important, okay?

362
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,190
Oh, gray hair!

363
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,000
Have I got any?

364
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,410
We're turning forty next year.

365
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:30,220
It's been over three years
since my first film.

366
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,720
Have you got any idea what
being a film producer is like?

367
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,530
I have to worry about the director.
And listen to the boss.

368
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,440
Get bashed by investors.

369
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:48,450
I'm not even
getting paid on time.

370
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,550
I'm not a boss. Just a soldier.

371
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,660
Cheer up, soldier.

372
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:22,670
Hey! If I wanted to,
I could have just fired you!

373
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:34,690
But I believe in you.
You are a good person.

374
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,990
And you're a genius.

375
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,800
You'll make this happen.

376
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,100
- Genius?
- Yeah, genius!

377
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:50,100
All directors are a genius.

378
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,010
Well, I'm flattered.

379
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,180
What are you doing, mom?

380
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,090
Ah, nothing.
Let me hear you play again.

381
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,890
I'm not good yet.
Cords are complicated.

382
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,490
Come on, one more time.

383
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,000
Buy me an effector. Then I'll play.

384
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,410
I'll think about it.

385
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,630
Gone to Chicago Film Festival.

386
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,630
"Creativity Booster, how to summon
the God of Creativity."

387
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,140
"Stick a spoon on your forehead
and smother a plate."

388
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:14,450
God comes to me.

389
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,850
What are you doing?

390
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:28,660
Our hero needs more tragedy.
In terms of making profit,

391
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,670
there needs to be a big
scene within 20 minutes.

392
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,860
Shall we make someone die?

393
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,570
It's too unrealistic.

394
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,970
Who do you have in
mind for the actor?

395
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,570
He's not going to attract any money.

396
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:47,680
Something ordinary? I want something
extraordinary. That's why I chose you.

397
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,880
I have to think about the result.

398
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,590
You asked, what is a movie?

399
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,990
Why do you ask me such a thing?

400
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,100
Come on, eat.

401
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,710
Just write whatever you want.

402
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,310
How's it coming along?

403
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,910
So-so.

404
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,110
How many scenes are done?

405
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:31,020
Nobody understands
this psychotic fantasy!

406
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,120
I'm still working on the first scene.

407
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,840
Alright. Take your time.

408
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,140
- Are you sure?
- Yup.

409
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,040
You need energy to write.

410
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,750
Eat plenty.

411
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:05,060
- Have any other ideas for a movie?
- Pardon?

412
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,960
I don't see any music film
making a hit lately.

413
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,760
And why are there so many of them now?

414
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,360
But if you consider it
as a whole genre...

415
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,170
The '200 Pounds Beauty.'
That was a nice movie.

416
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,370
Can you make it like that?

417
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:31,590
Not many days left till December.
A promise is a promise. Schedule...

418
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:35,680
I'm not a machine! I need time!

419
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,590
- Are you angry at me?
- Yes, I am.

420
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,990
That's okay. It can happen.

421
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,310
Come on.

422
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,910
Come on.

423
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,320
So you've got some temper too.
That's cute.

424
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,640
Directors are so selfish. They only
care about their own steak.

425
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,340
Just kidding. Don't take it so seriously.

426
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:43,350
You see. I'm not selfish.
Just a meat lover.

427
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:54,070
Directors have to move swiftly.
But you seem to have trouble.

428
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,170
- Pardon?
- Young directors catch on to things fast.

429
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:04,680
Who looks after your son
when you're out like this?

430
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,190
Don't you find film-making to be tough?

431
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,990
Soon, you might be in a tight spot.

432
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,300
Then I'm forced to choose
either the right or easy way.

433
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,300
Excuse me?

434
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,500
Nothing. Forget it.

435
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,870
Everyone fears a loss.

436
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,060
But the anxiety,
doubts and distrust that grows feeding

437
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,470
on this fear are viruses.

438
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,570
Be careful. Not to be infected.

439
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,910
Congratulations on receiving
the Best Director Award.

440
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,820
Thank you. I still have
a long way to go.

441
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:30,220
By the way, I recently
wrote a new script.

442
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,530
- Oh, you wrote it yourself?
- Yes, and I was thinking...

443
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,840
- Hi, Producer Choi, it's been a while.
- How are things going?

444
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:46,430
Not bad. I haven't seen
you around these days.

445
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:51,240
Oh, I've been quite busy.
Hold on. I'll call you again.

446
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,150
Yes.

447
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,260
Hello.

448
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:10,060
We wrote new song. Would you
like to come hear our new song?

449
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:33,140
Behind this wall of hazy glass
I can't see any more.

450
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:39,750
What it is that I'm doing

451
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:50,660
All these confusing thought
And mindless mind

452
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:56,670
All these things that surround me

453
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:25,500
Can't believe myself
No one believes me

454
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:31,100
No one believes what I say

455
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:43,020
All these confusing thoughts
And mindless mind

456
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:49,030
All these things surrounding me

457
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:53,190
Please help my script get
approved for production.

458
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,490
If it doesn't like the last time...

459
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,390
If it doesn't...

460
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,200
I shall not forgive you!

461
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,120
Let's make it brief
and straight forward.

462
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,920
Opinions, please.

463
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,730
I don't know what this
is trying to say.

464
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:46,940
It's not bad, but it's not
commercial enough.

465
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,140
I feel that it needs more focus.

466
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,150
For a film about music,
it's lacking a love line.

467
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:58,150
It'll be hard to cast actors.

468
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,960
People won't watch this.
There are better movies.

469
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:15,470
I feel that we shouldn't
proceed with this.

470
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,190
You've been working hard.

471
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,190
But if you really want
realism in your movie,

472
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,190
you should make documentaries.

473
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,600
Films about music
aren't easy to make.

474
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,310
So you've made an easy choice.

475
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,910
Jiwan... Is this because
I'm a meat lover?

476
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:13,230
Jiwan, it's been a pleasure
to work with you.

477
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:21,040
- You know what I'm saying, right?
- No, I don't.

478
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,840
If you were in my shoes,
you would've done the same.

479
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,340
You know what?

480
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,950
There was something
I wanted to talk about.

481
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:46,060
People.

482
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,760
Story about people.

483
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,370
Sorry.

484
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:07,940
I got the bill.

485
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:27,860
It should be entertaining. That's all it takes.
But is your script entertaining?

486
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,360
You should've made your debut.
When Korean films were thriving.

487
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,770
It now takes more than just
a script for new directors.

488
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:44,380
These days, thrillers are in.
You should try that.

489
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:51,390
Sorry. We're really
tight on our budget.

490
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:07,000
You never look back.
That's the problem.

491
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:10,200
Drink this.

492
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:18,510
Don't just sit around. My friend needs
someone to shoot her wedding video.

493
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:23,420
Stop wasting your energy!
Make money!

494
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,270
I heard what happened.

495
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,080
Yeah, not so lucky.

496
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:31,090
- How's your work coming along?
- Oh, I start shooting soon.

497
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,880
The casting was done so quickly.

498
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,090
That's really good.

499
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,890
Yeah... My daughter must
be my lucky charm.

500
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:51,800
Like me, you should wait for your chance.
And not revise your script all the time.

501
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:57,910
I mean, you work too hard.
But it's about "doing it right."

502
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:06,520
Rainbow. Nice title.

503
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:16,220
This is like your baby.
How can you just throw this out?

504
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,540
How did this happen?

505
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,840
We have a gangster
in our house now.

506
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,550
- He beat the hell out of his senior!
- What?

507
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,760
That bastard took my guitar.

508
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:45,850
Shame on you! Are you
going to school to fight?

509
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:50,060
All this music nonsense.
You are quitting that band!

510
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,160
- No!
- How dare you?

511
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,570
No! I'm not quitting!

512
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,070
Why are you doing that?

513
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,660
He loves that band.
You can't tell him to quit.

514
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,170
Band?

515
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,580
I won't let him be like you.

516
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:06,570
- What?
- You want him to become like you?

517
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,080
When are you going to stop it?

518
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,790
This is all because of you, mom!

519
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:28,400
You... Is this so damn
important to you?

520
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,910
You think you can be a director?

521
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:44,020
You're just a loser.

522
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,650
Feels nice to walk with a camera
after so long, huh?

523
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:30,660
Oh, I think they're shooting a movie.
Let's check it out. Hurry!

524
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,860
Jiwan!

525
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,390
Hey, keep those people off the set!

526
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,690
Oh, it's you!

527
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,700
- You know him?
- Yes...

528
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:04,990
It's you, Jiwan, right?

529
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:14,500
It is you! What are you doing here?
Are you shooting somewhere near here?

530
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:18,810
- Oh, I'm scouting for locations.
- I see.

531
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,410
Hey, meet my assistant director.

532
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,520
Nice to meet you.

533
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:29,720
So now you're finally making
your debut. Congratulations.

534
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:33,130
Oh, could you do me a favor?
We need an extra.

535
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,130
This person didn't show up.
I know you can act.

536
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,230
- Okay?
- I'm not sure...

537
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:44,930
Could you give her the script?
Thank you, Jiwan!

538
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:47,540
Here is the script.

539
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,740
So, this man tries to start a fight
with you, another passerby.

540
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,540
That guy is your counterpart.
You just need to walk.

541
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,840
Scene 72. Cut 13. Take 1.

542
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,750
Ready! Action!

543
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,970
Hey you.

544
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,370
Come here.

545
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,380
Lady, where are you going?

546
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,300
Ma'am, I said, where are you going?

547
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,290
I don't know.

548
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,800
Cut! NG!

549
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,810
That must've hurt a lot.
Are you ok?

550
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,320
Where are you going, ma'am?

551
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:09,320
I said, where are you going?

552
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,120
I don't know.

553
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,630
Cut! NG!

554
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:26,930
Where are you going?

555
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:32,640
I said, where are you going?

556
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,850
I don't know.

557
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:42,650
Cut! NG!

558
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,860
The tide is coming in. Hurry up!

559
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:51,870
I said, where are you going?

560
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,260
I don't know.

561
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:01,970
Cut! NG!

562
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,570
I said, where are you going?

563
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,880
I don't know.

564
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,390
Cut! NG!

565
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,690
Where are you going?

566
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:29,400
I don't know.

567
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,100
Cut! NG!

568
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:50,130
Ma'am I said... where are you going?

569
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,430
I don't know...

570
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,130
Cut! NG!

571
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:09,640
Jiwan, who would react like that?
Is a movie some joke?

572
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,040
One more time.

573
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,950
- We are giving it another go.
- Hurry it up!

574
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,650
Take fifteen.

575
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:21,250
Ready! Action!

576
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,160
Where are you going?

577
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:31,470
I said, where are you going?

578
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,670
I don't know!

579
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,480
It hurts! Why'd you hit me!

580
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:48,080
You told me to "just walk."
"Where am I going?"

581
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:52,280
Don't know, don't know, Don't know!
I said I don't know! I don't know!

582
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,990
You think I'm a joke?

583
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,580
You think I'm an idiot
because I'm always smiling?

584
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,290
You think I'm a joke?

585
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,990
I feel the pain, too!
It hurts! Hurts! Hurt! Hurt!

586
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:08,300
Cut! Ok! Wow! Great improvisation!

587
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,700
- This one's good!
- Yes.

588
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:20,210
- Jiwan!
- Jiwan!

589
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,820
So you liked getting slapped?

590
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,430
It's embarrassing.

591
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,430
You are now a masochistic idiot.

592
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,540
Yeah, I am an idiot.

593
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,140
Ms. Passerby!

594
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,840
Where did you want to go?

595
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,250
You don't know?

596
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,250
Where did you want to go?

597
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,750
You got your guitar back?

598
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,660
That asshole transferred
to another school.

599
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:50,860
Why?

600
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:53,160
Because he's embarrassed.

601
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,170
Rumors are spreading that
a junior beat him up.

602
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:04,280
I'll play the guitar for the concert.
My song has been approved.

603
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:07,480
- What song?
- I'm not telling you.

604
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,880
Are you also singing?

605
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,780
You bet.

606
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:17,580
- The girl got angry and she's out now.
- Why?

607
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,190
She won't sing my music
because it's shitty.

608
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:26,600
But you have stage phobia.
Won't that be a problem?

609
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:34,710
- You got smacked by someone?
- Oh, no.

610
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:42,610
Are you gonna keep standing there?
You're interrupting my practice. Get out!

611
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,270
Where are you?

612
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,670
You said you were coming.

613
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:44,870
Skip your class!

614
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:49,680
Forget it!

615
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,890
No one's here.

616
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,490
It's the rain.

617
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,500
No, it's because we
have no girl in the band.

618
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,590
That's a good thing.

619
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:18,310
Gundam Man and the Idols

620
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,510
Thank you for coming to our concert.

621
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:25,820
Now for the best band at Songmyeong
Middle School, Gundam Man and the Idols.

622
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,120
On guitar, Park Jaehee!

623
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,320
On the drums, Im Chanseok!

624
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:37,330
On guitar, Baek Siyoung!

625
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,940
And I'm the bassist,
Park Joohyeong.

626
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,740
The first song is called 'Passerby #3'.

627
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:08,860
Hey!

628
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,670
Turn up the volume!
Can't hear a thing!

629
01:25:53,680 --> 01:26:02,410
Walking aimlessly on the streets

630
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:09,910
So many tiring miles for my dream

631
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:14,230
Nobody knows who I am

632
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:18,630
I've always been around

633
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:23,040
Nobody knows who I am

634
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:28,740
I can go anywhere

635
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:37,450
Passerby #3 walks along the street

636
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:44,860
Nobody knows who he is

637
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:49,160
Nobody knows who I am

638
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:53,570
I've always been around

639
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,770
Nobody knows who I am

640
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,470
I can go anywhere

641
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:12,280
Forget that dream of yours

642
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:16,690
Just walk and go

643
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,690
Passerby #3

644
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,990
Nobody knows who I am

645
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:28,500
I've always been around

646

647
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,210
I can go anywhere

648
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,930
Nobody knows who I am

649
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,340
I've always been around

650
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:07,640
Nobody knows who I am

651
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:11,740
I can go anywhere

652
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,350
Mom, what's loser?

653
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,960
A person who has nothing to lose.

654
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:28,760
- How about winner?
- A person who has nothing to win.

655
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,770
Then which one are you?

656
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,670
- Just a passerby.
- What?

657
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,770
- A person walking by.
- That's whack.
