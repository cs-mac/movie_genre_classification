1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,236
<i> I was eating a tomato</i>
<i>at teatime a few weeks ago,</i>

2
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:07,996
<i>and I suddenly realized</i>
<i>that Mummy is not dead at all...</i>

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,912
<i>just very, very mysterious.</i>

4
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,933
<i> Papa spoke languages,</i>
<i>climbed mountains.</i>

5
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:21,693
<i>He was an adventurer.</i>

6
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:26,681
<i>But Mummy was</i>
<i>such a gifted person socially.</i>

7
00:00:26,757 --> 00:00:29,558
<i>She was a master</i>
<i>of the understatement,</i>

8
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:31,668
<i>an adventuress.</i>

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,339
<i>And he was cold and dark,</i>

10
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:42,411
<i>and she was warm and light.</i>

11
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:48,435
<i>And I was "little Tony."</i>

12
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:51,159
Bye. Your mummy loves you.

13
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:54,381
<i>I was the steam</i>
<i>when hot meets cold.</i>

14
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:59,791
<i> Midge? Well, hello.</i>

15
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,554
The reason that I called, darling,
is that Aschwin,

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,280
Prince Aschwin Lippe -

17
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,467
his brother is Prince Bernhard -

18
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:10,304
well, Aschwin thought it would be lovely
to meet at the Stork Club tonight.

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,140
He so wants to know you and Joost,
and asked if I could...

20
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,713
Well, of course.

21
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,821
Shall we say... 10:30?

22
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:22,044
Is that too Continental?

23
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:31,060
Be as catty as you want, but Tony
can hear every word you're saying.

24
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:34,168
Can you imagine
the world he's growing up into?

25
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:38,426
Brooks and I will see you tonight.

26
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:43,145
Brooks...

27
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:45,141
darling.

28
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:51,202
I gather that
you're making commitments for me.

29
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,152
Sans permission,
sans consultation.

30
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:03,403
Prince Aschwin de Lippe, please.

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,242
You may say
Barbara Baekeland is calling.

32
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,273
Don't get difficult,
not tonight, darling.

33
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,342
Please forgive the intrusion
and the damnably short notice,

34
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,182
but we are having supper
with Midge and Joost van den Heuvel,

35
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:18,980
and they would so like
the pleasure of your company.

36
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:21,972
They'll be delighted.

37
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:23,776
As will I.

38
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,500
As will Brooks.

39
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,452
Thank you, darling.

40
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:37,127
<i>People say now that I must have hated</i>
<i>them because of what... transpired...</i>

41
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,775
We won't be back too late,
I promise.

42
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:44,532
<i>... but everything that happened</i>
<i>happened because of love.</i>

43
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,949
Do I...

44
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:51,016
Do I look like a monkey to you?

45
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:56,042
Then why on earth should I get dressed up
in a fucking monkey suit just to eat?

46
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:59,226
You don't have to wear your tux.
And no need to be vulgar.

47
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,104
- In front of the b-o-y?
- Just wear your uniform.

48
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:05,749
- I will not.
- You look so handsome in your uniform.

49
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,358
The war is over.
Had you not heard?

50
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:10,698
You have a right.
You won the war.

51
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:15,647
I mean, you volunteered,
so you have a right to wear your uniform.

52
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:18,909
Your father looked so handsome,
so dashing.

53
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,865
So dashing.

54
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:26,544
Is the little paragon coming with,
or do you plan on leaving him here alone?

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,308
Nini will be here at nine.

56
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:32,030
In that case,
I'm glad that I shall be dining out.

57
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:42,888
Tone. Tony, Tony...

58
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:45,842
Mother, do you think
we should call him "Antony"?

59
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,523
"Antony" will be his full name,
his formal name, his name to the world.

60
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,395
And "Tony" will be his name as a child...
and among intimates.

61
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,851
When I refer to him,

62
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:01,227
when I am asked
if I have a photograph, do I say...

63
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,529
You say, "This is Tony."

64
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:07,059
And they will say,
"What an angel!"

65
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:08,747
Oh, yes.

66
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:10,473
An angel.

67
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,430
What an angel.

68
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:15,768
What an angel you are.

69
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:19,183
- We may be out late.
- "Shall."

70
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,554
Oh, yes... your mummy loves you.

71
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:30,808
Barbara.

72
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:35,028
Good night, Tony.
You are in good hands.

73
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:37,100
Enjoy the Stork Club.

74
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,131
And you may stay out
as late as you wish.

75
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,085
Fuck!

76
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:06,911
Mr. and Mrs. Baekeland.
Right this way, ma'am.

77
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,249
She's gorgeous.

78
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,487
Hello.

79
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,674
Wonderful to see you.

80
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,861
How do you do?

81
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,194
- I'm Barbara.
- Simone.

82
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,688
How do you do?

83
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:40,788
Why, it was with Dieter that Brooks
went on his great adventure, in Peru,

84
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:42,745
in the Villa...

85
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,541
Darling, you know
I'm not at my best with geography.

86
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:50,111
Brooks, help me. Villa?

87
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:54,600
Darling, don't press. Maybe your husband
doesn't feel like in midst of dinner.

88
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:57,363
Brooks, please,
if you don't feel like performing...

89
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,358
- Vilcabamba.
- Ah.

90
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:03,118
Dieter and I,
we went to the Vilcabamba in Peru.

91
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:07,376
So tell us, man,
what was your "little adventure"?

92
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,487
It was nothing.

93
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,863
Well, I lie.
It was something.

94
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:18,503
I was intrigued by a 400-year-old mystery -
what became of Manco Inca.

95
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,651
I wanted to find the ruins
of the lost city.

96
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:25,409
This is actually true.
Give him a dirt road and he'll go up it.

97
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,903
That's very good.

98
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,746
- Would you, Simone?
- Oh, I don't know.

99
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:47,278
Your husband asked you a question.

100
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:49,695
This seems... unfair.

101
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:52,419
This seems...
tedious.

102
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,335
- Hmm... but would you?
- Yes, would you?

103
00:06:56,179 --> 00:07:01,051
Would I eat a pound of human flesh
for $10 million?

104
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,468
No, I would not.

105
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,612
I <i>have</i> eaten horse flesh, you know.

106
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,564
There is a difference between eating
the <i>cheval</i> and eating the <i>chevalier.</i>

107
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:15,784
Brooks, for $10 million,
would you sleep with Simone?

108
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,966
- For $10 million, would you...
- Don't, Barbara.

109
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:22,422
Please, don't be tedious.

110
00:07:24,148 --> 00:07:29,596
Would you go home with the first person
you met going through a nightclub door?

111
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:31,937
Yes, I would.

112
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,658
So... shall we get on with our drinks?

113
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:39,073
Brooks, Barbara,
have you ever been to the Engadin?

114
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,873
Oh, I was practically born in Gstaad!

115
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,866
She practically loves
the ski instructors.

116
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,560
Thank you for coming this evening.

117
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:01,325
Bye.

118
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,241
Barbara.

119
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,889
You said you'd go home
with the first person you met

120
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,615
- at a nightclub.
- No...

121
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:12,797
So I thought I might go home
with the first person...

122
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:13,948
Hello!

123
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,823
Hello, I'm awfully thirsty.
Would you buy me a drink?

124
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,125
Aschwin, Simone.

125
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,928
- Barbara!
- Brooks.

126
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,645
Lovely to see you all.

127
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,660
Nini.

128
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,075
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Quite all right.

129
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:01,331
- I must have...
- You fell asleep. Quite natural.

130
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,398
It's late.
It got late, you fell asleep.

131
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:09,810
- I trust your evening was...
- Oh, we had a fine time.

132
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,421
I can hold down the fort.

133
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:14,491
- Where's Barbara?
- She's returning separately.

134
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,946
- May I get your coat?
- I'll just go.

135
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,670
- And was the prince there?
- Excuse me?

136
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,471
The prince.
The prince of Amsterdam.

137
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:23,852
- Ah.
- Was he there?

138
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:27,727
I think you're thinking of Prince Bernhard,
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.

139
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:31,410
He was Count Lippe-Biesterfeld, of course,
before he married Juliana.

140
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,789
The man with whom we dined,
Aschwin Lippe,

141
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:36,743
is just Aschwin Lippe,
younger brother -

142
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,738
a prince in title, but not in any way...

143
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,498
- Oh, because Barbara said...
- "Barbara said"!

144
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,704
Decent man, nonetheless.

145
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,392
I see.

146
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:57,500
Good man.

147
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,460
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

148
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:46,302
Hey, kid.

149
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:49,640
Oh, what a life.

150
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:52,671
Thirsty? Hm? Thirsty boy?

151
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,203
Tony a thirsty boy?

152
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,454
<i>Papa used to say, "For $2, the court fee,</i>
<i>and $10 for a wedding band,</i>

153
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:06,559
<i>"I made your mummy into</i>
<i>'Mrs. Brooks Baekeland'...</i>

154
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,749
<i>S'il vous plaît!</i>

155
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:12,468
<i>"...and myself for the next 30 years</i>
<i>into 'Barbara's husband. '"</i>

156
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:45,924
Oh!

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,878
You are an angel.

158
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,947
- Where's Papa?
- He went to visit Durán.

159
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:55,170
What shall we do today?

160
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,165
Ah. Well...

161
00:11:57,242 --> 00:12:02,498
tonight we're going to l'Hippo
with Marcel and his wife Teeny.

162
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:05,452
- You remember them.
<i>- Ceux-là ne me plaisent pas.</i>

163
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,332
<i>En anglais, s'il vous plaît.</i>

164
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,478
- Doesn't sound like much fun for a kid.
- You don't have to come.

165
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,473
- But when you leave me alone...
- Tony.

166
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,737
...I feel no bigger than a lima bean.

167
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,497
Oh... you won't be alone.
You'll be with Clothilde.

168
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:20,684
Maybe since I'll be with
boring Clothilde,

169
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:24,137
we can balance it out with something
more fun during the day?

170
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,669
Ah... I see where this is going.

171
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,506
- I need time to paint.
- I'd like to go on the Ferris wheel.

172
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,230
- Really?
- And for lunch, I'd like some ice cream.

173
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:34,227
Ah!

174
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,143
But you had ice cream for breakfast.

175
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:42,706
Please don't tell Papa.

176
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:46,006
I won't.
It will be our secret.

177
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,308
As will the aspirins
you're going to fetch...

178
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:51,185
From the bathroom,
next to the sink.

179
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:56,019
Your mother
has a shocking hangover.

180
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,046
Mummy...

181
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,499
I shall cure you.

182
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,814
- Ha!
- Oh!

183
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,360
Ha!

184
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,698
OK! OK, OK.

185
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:34,770
I concede, I resign.

186
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,842
Well, sir, I'm pretty expert.

187
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:40,640
So there's no embarrassment
in losing, if that's a concern.

188
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,433
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

189
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,423
Will you still love me when my hair is gray
and my tits are sagging?

190
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,534
Well, of course.

191
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:57,675
- Do you remember the dog?
- What dog?

192
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:01,511
- Which dog?
- The one we had in Italy.

193
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,506
Giotto.

194
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,537
I remember when Giotto died.

195
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,532
- He was old.
- No, he wasn't.

196
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,796
In dog years.

197
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:13,558
- We still have his collar.
- I know.

198
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,589
- Somewhere.
- I know where.

199
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,963
Leo was famous.
Not like you're famous, of course.

200
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,920
Well, I'm not...

201
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:25,184
For heaven's sake.
You won the Premio Nadal.

202
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:28,867
You know Picasso, you know Camus,
you know Malraux, you know Dali.

203
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:31,591
Pilar knows them.
I just write.

204
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:35,389
What I'm saying, Carlos,
is that Leo's fame, like yours,

205
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,880
was a function of achievement,
came from what he did.

206
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:40,875
So Leo's stroke of genius

207
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:45,671
was the notion that the formaldehyde
might stabilize the phenol, give it strength.

208
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:49,546
But they never mixed. Leo thought,
"Let's try putting it under pressure."

209
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:53,728
Poof! Long chain molecules,
Bakelite, plastic.

210
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,373
The telephone, bracelets,
radios, records,

211
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,056
coffins, submarines,
the housing for the atom bomb -

212
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,819
the world as we know it today.

213
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:07,655
- That was your father?
- No, that was my grandfather.

214
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:11,684
My father is a <i>crapule.</i>
My grandfather decidedly was not.

215
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:15,827
- What does Papa do?
- How do you mean?

216
00:15:15,904 --> 00:15:19,472
- Well, François at the...
- At the <i>école?</i>

217
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:25,764
- François asked me...
- You can tell him, "My father writes.

218
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,105
"My father explores.

219
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:32,287
"My father has
a very refined knowledge of mathematics."

220
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,399
Oh.

221
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:37,888
And you can tell him that your mother
was almost a movie star.

222
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:43,528
Do you find my wife attractive?

223
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,137
Most men do.

224
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,286
But what she doesn't...

225
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,703
what Barbara doesn't realize...

226
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:53,772
is that women find me...

227
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:58,645
you know...

228
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,640
attractive.

229
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,282
Some people's fathers,
some people's mothers,

230
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:10,078
they have to go to an office or a factory
or a store, I guess, every day.

231
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:12,073
But we are fortunate...

232
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,252
because what we do
is what we love.

233
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,900
What does François' father do?

234
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,545
- He works.
- Ah, well, we worked.

235
00:16:23,621 --> 00:16:27,918
I mean, Father worked, Nini worked.
There was no other way.

236
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:32,637
I kind of had to raise myself,
and then I worked, too - at Filene's.

237
00:16:32,714 --> 00:16:35,553
Then when I could, I left.

238
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,855
I just left.

239
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:42,805
Nini wanted what was best for me -
only what was best for me.

240
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:44,685
"Find the mon," she'd say.

241
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:49,979
She meant "man," I guess,
and she meant "money."

242
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,622
The rich, they don't have
pet names for money.

243
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:57,384
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci
wrote backwards?

244
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,571
So you could only read it in a mirror.

245
00:17:21,555 --> 00:17:22,936
<i>- Entrez.</i>
- Hi.

246
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,893
Carlos!

247
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:29,036
Pilar!
My, you're looking swell!

248
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:30,111
<i>Gracias.</i>

249
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:34,254
Mrs. Baekeland, permit me
to introduce Monsieur Souvestre.

250
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,784
Jean-Pierre,
I am so happy to meet you.

251
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,741
Please, come in.

252
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,342
I have been dying to ask you
about Marcel Proust,

253
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,798
your biography of whom
I have yet to read

254
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:51,634
as my French reading skills
are not what they will be.

255
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:54,090
It is not necessary
to apologize for that.

256
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,315
Brooks reads the language
like a native.

257
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,538
And our Tony is mastering it every day
at the <i>école bilingue.</i>

258
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,490
But for poor <i>moi,</i> I must confess,
it's been a struggle, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

259
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,216
Understood.

260
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,631
What was I saying?
Oh... yes.

261
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,314
Jean-Pierre,
was Proust truly a homosexual?

262
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,539
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu penses?</i>

263
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,985
So you met Carlos here in Paris?

264
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:26,011
I was at the Sorbonne, the adoring
graduate student writing about his work.

265
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:31,804
But then... we woke up one morning
and none of that seemed to matter.

266
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:33,799
I think I knew he was serious

267
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:38,135
when he introduced me
to Marcel and Teeny Duchamp.

268
00:18:38,211 --> 00:18:41,204
Oh! I ran into them today,
at I'Équipe.

269
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:44,120
They said they might
stop over... later.

270
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,731
<i>Je peux lui telephoner?</i>

271
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,993
You may be assured
they were only being polite.

272
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,781
I don't want to be impolite, but
M. Souvestre has the early day tomorrow.

273
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,661
He's off to Vittel.

274
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:03,188
It is regrettable,
but what Mrs. Durán says is the truth.

275
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:07,485
<i>Un petit café</i> for the road?
And you've yet to meet Tony.

276
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:09,902
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

277
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:22,410
<i>Monsieur Souvestre, permettez-moi</i>
<i>de vous présenter mon fils, Tony.</i>

278
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:24,789
Did I get it right?
Did I get the order right?

279
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,203
The younger is presented to the older,
the less distinguished to the more so.

280
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,004
Exception: a gentleman
is always presented to a lady.

281
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:36,951
Exception to the exception: unless the man
is a president, a cardinal or a sovereign.

282
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:39,176
So, then, it's right.

283
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:41,708
Well, everyone, this is Tony.

284
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:43,550
Say hello.

285
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,660
<i>Buenas noches,</i>
<i>señor y señora Durán.</i>

286
00:19:45,737 --> 00:19:47,310
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

287
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,724
<i>Bonsoir, M. Souvestre.</i>
<i>Enchanté de faire votre connaissance.</i>

288
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:53,870
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>
- Told you his French is better than mine.

289
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,518
Perhaps you'd like to read something.

290
00:19:57,554 --> 00:20:00,393
Perhaps Tony would prefer
to get his sleep.

291
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,117
Especially as M. Souvestre
has an early start.

292
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,843
Please.

293
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,570
For me.

294
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:28,938
Thank you, Tony.
It was gracious of you to volunteer.

295
00:20:28,976 --> 00:20:30,702
You are welcome, señora.

296
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,081
Your mother's a bit tired, as are we.

297
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,076
As, I'm sure, are you.

298
00:20:35,575 --> 00:20:37,877
- Um...
- Then we call it an evening.

299
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:40,524
As your friend,
Monsieur Duchamp, says...

300
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:45,243
Your husband or your son
will translate.

301
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,162
Don't you dare.

302
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:50,385
Don't you dare condescend to me.
Fucking French!

303
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:53,799
They tell you how to raise your child,
and then they stare at your ass.

304
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,370
Yes, <i>cul -</i>
I know the word!

305
00:20:56,446 --> 00:21:00,130
It's sick.
This society is sick!

306
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,588
Excuse me.

307
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,621
"Move-ez"!

308
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:16,934
I shall be leaving too.
Tell Tony his father says good night.

309
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:19,121
<i>Un momento, por favor.</i>

310
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,186
<i>Vos clés.</i>

311
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:00,250
What are you doing
in my hotel room?

312
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,151
You bribed the concierge,
didn't you?

313
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,268
Hello?

314
00:23:57,345 --> 00:23:59,263
Hello?

315
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:08,932
Mummy?

316
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:12,385
Mummy?

317
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:31,568
<i>- Bonjour, Maman.</i>
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

318
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,086
Who's that boy?

319
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:42,234
François.

320
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,574
From the <i>école?</i>

321
00:24:45,112 --> 00:24:47,567
From the <i>école bilingue?</i>

322
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,253
I know where he's from.

323
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,890
When you left, and then when Mummy left,
I didn't want to be alone,

324
00:24:56,967 --> 00:24:59,883
so I called François,
and he came over.

325
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,415
We listened to the radio.
It was Boulez -

326
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:05,830
one of those poems by René Char,
which Boulez set to music.

327
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:07,940
I rather like Boulez,
don't you, Mummy?

328
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:10,549
I know that some consider him
atonal and all that,

329
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:14,961
but I think they just don't know
how to listen, or what to listen for.

330
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:17,493
Your friend leaves.

331
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:21,406
Now.

332
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,085
Get him a towel.

333
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:25,939
That wasn't bad, you know.

334
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,435
Tony?

335
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:29,661
Do you have a cigarette for me?

336
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:33,574
Black.

337
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:35,761
I like black tobacco.

338
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:38,178
But sometimes I yearn for the brown.

339
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,288
- You know how they are.
- What?

340
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,818
- Fussing, always making a fuss.
- Not all women.

341
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:16,928
Damn near all.

342
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,806
Always telling us, you know.

343
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:24,141
Always telling us
where to put our cocks,

344
00:27:24,218 --> 00:27:26,175
where not to...

345
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:29,666
and so forth.

346
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:32,966
I don't need to tell you.
You've seen, you know.

347
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:36,073
So what are you saying?

348
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,716
You'll soon be...
Hell, you're on your own.

349
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:45,512
I just wanted to give you a piece of...
what fathers tell sons.

350
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,000
Well, thanks.

351
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:52,724
I mean, your mother was an actress.

352
00:27:53,684 --> 00:27:56,906
In some ways, <i>is</i> an actress.
Will mostly likely be...

353
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,515
Mummy can be histrionic,
but she's not...

354
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:02,470
Don't defend her.
You needn't defend her.

355
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,733
You love her, as do I,
but for the moment,

356
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,726
we're sitting here,
Brooks and Antony, two men.

357
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:16,282
Had she been on time,
we'd never have had this discussion.

358
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,861
Do you think she gets stoned?

359
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:33,201
Well, she's Spanish.

360
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,079
Worth a pull?

361
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,762
After you, pal.

362
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,783
<i>¿Te gustaría fumar?</i>

363
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,008
<i>Sí.</i>

364
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:51,003
<i>Gracias.</i>

365
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:01,324
Taught by experts.

366
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,388
You know what this place needs?

367
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:11,146
Some music.

368
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:13,525
- I have one.
- Excuse me?

369
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:37,504
<i># Once upon a time</i>
<i>a long, long time ago</i>

370
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:43,029

<i>I would surely follow</i>

371
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:47,633

<i>some pain and misery</i>

372
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:52,697

373
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:58,068
<i># Telling me</i>
<i>how much you need me</i>

00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:02,135
<i># Ain't nobody home</i>

00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:04,552
<i># Girl</i>

00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:07,008
<i># Ain't nobody home</i>

377
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:13,108
<i># How many times</i>

378
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:17,405
<i># But you laughed at me</i>
<i>and said, "Let me alone"</i>

379
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:21,740
<i># Ain't nobody home</i>

380
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:22,623
<i># Girl</i>

381
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:24,618
- I don't know.
- What's she like?

382
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:28,838
- I don't know. She's Spanish.
- Well, with a name like Blanca...

383
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:31,677
- Blanca what?
- I don't know Blanca what.

384
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:34,862
This is not a city, it's a port,
so when we hang out,

385
00:30:34,939 --> 00:30:37,931
it's typically on a first-name basis.

386
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:42,919
And if what you're asking is,
"Does she come from <i>bonne famille?"...</i>

387
00:30:42,996 --> 00:30:46,142
You know,
if that's what you're asking, well...

388
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:51,820
aren't there enough counts and countesses
in that stack of <i>cartes de visite</i> in the foyer,

389
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,084
just the way that Nini taught you?

390
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,110
The <i>carte</i> from Prince Bernhard is
always on top, and the bills on the bottom.

391
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:02,332
You will not
speak to your mother like that.

392
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,711
I will not stand for it.

393
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:06,514
Oh, piss off.

394
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,526
A mother knows.

395
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,868
Hm?

396
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:23,894
When her son...
when her son might like someone.

397
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,480
The discovery, that was 1907.

398
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:26,163
In less than ten years
my grandfather was a very wealthy man.

399
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,578
1924, his face on the cover
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

400
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:34,374
1930, Coco Chanel makes all her
mannequins wear Bakelite accessories.

401
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:37,904
Then came the Depression,
which hit everyone except the Baekelands.

402
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,820
We were headed the other direction.

403
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:44,234
Our triumph -
and, of course, our downfall.

404
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:46,690
How do you mean?

405
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:49,337
Leo knew the social register,

406
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:52,636
but it wasn't what moved him,
it wasn't what he prized.

407
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:55,092
To him, all that was just <i>la parade.</i>

408
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,969
But not to George -
his son, my father.

409
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:02,957
He valued all that to a fault,
and in the process lost everything.

410
00:33:02,995 --> 00:33:06,065
<i>Camarero!</i>
No one here is drinking enough.

411
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,827
Another round over here.

412
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:14,083
Tony, let's drink while your father
bores the shit out of your little friend.

413
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,757
- She's not very happy.
- Ah!

414
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,404
Then you understand.

415
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:34,418
Well, it's been a long night.

416
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,139
Bye, kiddo.

417
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,518
- Night, Blanca.
- Good night.

418
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:53,064
- Are you sure that?
- Yes!

419
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:31,431
You know, I don't think
I've ever met a family like yours.

420
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:36,188
All this excitement,
all this history.

421
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,296
- Well, there is that.
- Yes.

422
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:55,760
You really are
such a handsome boy.

423
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:09,304
<i>Later, Mummy said</i>
<i>that I had brought Blanca home</i>

424
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:13,409
<i>like a kitten</i>
<i>that had killed its first mouse...</i>

425
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,711
<i>and laid it at your feet.</i>

426
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:21,159
<i>And you... and you took it.</i>

427
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:52,466
<i>Por favor. ¿Adónde hora</i>
<i>esta la aeroplane de Nice?</i>

428
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:56,418
- Landing? When it lands?
- Oh, it's been delayed.

429
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:58,950
So, 6p.m.
Anytime after that.

430
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,359
<i> Paging Mr. Baekeland -
<i>to the Aviaco counter, please.</i>

431
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:22,929
Paging, please, Mr. Baekeland -
to Aviaco.

432
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,231
Your party is waiting.

433
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:31,715
Boarding time's at 1:30, no?

434
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:34,823
Let me see.

435
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:40,923
Yeah, it's 1:30.

436
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,331
Come, darling.

437
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:50,093
Coward!

438
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:53,546
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

439
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,886
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

440
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:59,109
That's right, that's you
I'm talking about you, little <i>puta.</i>

441
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:00,951
You little whore!

442
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:05,670
<i>- Aún no estamos embarcando.</i>
<i>- Señor, por favor.</i>

443
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,972
You are truly disgusting,
do you know that?

444
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:10,005
You and your little Spanish cunt.

445
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:13,880
- You're speaking too loudly.
- I am speaking of a cunt, half your age.

446
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:17,563
She looked at Tony, looked at you,
thought for about five seconds,

447
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:20,786
and said to herself,
"Ha! That's where the money is."

448
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,283
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

449
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,467
You go on about your grandfather
and the life of the fucking mind.

450
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:28,383
I go away for one week,
and what do you do? <i></i>

451
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:31,874
Something very intellectual.
Very intellectual indeed.

452
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,941
Oh, does he fuck you up the ass?
<i>¿Por el culo?</i>

453
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:38,550
That's what he likes, you know.

454
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,583
He thinks it's very manly.

455
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,765
I think... quite the opposite.

456
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,950
She bats her eyes at you and says:

457
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:50,060
"Oh, Brooks, you...

458
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:53,935
"you big man, you."

459
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:58,462
And you honor the great
Baekeland tradition by fucking her.

460
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,683
OK... fuck her.

461
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,443
Fuck her. I understand.

462
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,514
But leave me?

463
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:11,891
Break my heart?
Break Tony's?

464
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,922
He never broke Tony's heart.

465
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,451
And neither did I.

466
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,441
Much of what you've just said
is an amalgam of paranoia and spite.

467
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:27,007
Sell yourself to yourself any way you like,
but in your heart, you know.

468
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,578
So does everyone else.

469
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,573
Also...

470
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:35,486
you're a little old for this,
don't you think?

471
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,187
<i>¿No lleva equipaje?</i>

472
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,855
<i>No tengo.</i>

473
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:11,134
You are a very nice man.

474
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:17,311
<i>Un... hombre... encantador.</i>

475
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,868
<i>Jake was like a devil...</i>
<i>or a magician.</i>

476
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:15,283
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.

477
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:22,880
<i>He wore little bones and things</i>
<i>on his vest - these certain little bones.</i>

478
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:29,786
Tony! Jake!

479
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:33,661
- You might have knocked.
- I did.

480
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:40,106
I went to the airport today,
to pick up Sam.

481
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:43,176
Who should I see but your father?

482
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:46,168
We had a word or two,
I can tell you that.

483
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:49,506
You <i>can</i> tell me,
you <i>are</i> telling me.

484
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,269
- Don't get harsh with me.
- I'm sorry.

485
00:42:52,345 --> 00:42:56,028
Are you defending him?
Are you taking his side?

486
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:58,024
You must have had a long drive.

487
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,055
Sit down and let me pour you
something to drink, OK?

488
00:43:19,202 --> 00:43:22,425
So I told Sam
you'd be joining us for dinner.

489
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:25,456
I'll see you around nine.

490
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:31,134
How can you live in this shithole?

491
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:55,880
<i>Sam was often called a walker-</i>

492
00:43:55,957 --> 00:43:59,564
<i>one of those homosexuals who escort</i>
<i>wealthy women to dinner or to the opera</i>

493
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,866
<i>when their husbands are not able.</i>

494
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:05,664
<i>But Sam's devotion to Barbara</i>
<i>was never about the money.</i>

495
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,350
<i>In fact, he liked us more</i>
<i>when there was less of it.</i>

496
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:11,304
Do you remember how it was
with Maxime de la Falaise?

497
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:13,836
There was a difficult period.

498
00:44:13,913 --> 00:44:17,558
I helped her, as much as I could -
a few of us, we did what we could -

499
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:20,051
and now, well...

500
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:23,926
no one remembers
the sad period now, do they?

501
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,029
These are the facts we have to face.

502
00:44:30,027 --> 00:44:34,132
One - we are dealing with
an insecure and capricious crowd

503
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:38,736
who, given any doubt or hesitation,
will always follow the money.

504
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:41,997
In this case, meaning Brooks.

505
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,402
Second, and this is in your favor...

506
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,970
you were,
to any sensible observer,

507
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:56,538
the charm and vivacity of the couple.

508
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:59,531
So, we must make that work
to your benefit.

509
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:03,406
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's my pleasure.

510
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:06,168
Pop across to Cadaqués
for a day or two.

511
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,388
<i>You need to be proud, not embarrassed,</i>
<i>to be seen in public.</i>

512
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:14,110
<i>And that will give people permission</i>
<i>to be seen with you.</i>

513
00:45:14,187 --> 00:45:15,568
<i>Hola. Un café...</i>

514
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:20,057
Let us think
who are those, you know,

515
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,241
from whom others take their cue?

516
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:26,579
Someone like Pilar Durán
would be terrific.

517
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:30,991
<i>And then, of course,</i>
<i>we need a doyenne to seal it.</i>

518
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,946
<i>You do, of course,</i>
<i>know Teeny Duchamp?</i>

519
00:45:33,984 --> 00:45:35,902
<i>Teeny Matisse Duchamp?</i>

520
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:40,353
And I shall, naturally,
make sure that the word gets out.

521
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:44,381
<i>As will others.</i>
<i> As will others!</i>

522
00:45:48,103 --> 00:45:50,098
You've got to start painting again.

523
00:45:50,136 --> 00:45:54,088
- The difference between...
- An artist and a divorcée.

524
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:56,275
So you understand.

525
00:45:57,272 --> 00:45:59,037
That's for starters.

526
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:02,030
Some of it will, I've no doubt,
be emotionally unpleasant.

527
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:04,370
Oh, please.
Where <i>is</i> he?

528
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,979
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, Barbara.

529
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:09,972
He's just... being Tony.

530
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:18,336
Mummy,
what I don't understand is Brooks.

531
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:21,904
Of all the places
Brooks would want to go for the season,

532
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:25,280
why choose a place right near us,
and then not want to see us?

533
00:46:25,357 --> 00:46:28,388
Why would Blanca want to go to Mallorca
when she hates me so much?

534
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:30,460
She doesn't hate you.

535
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,371
- And Brooks?
- He doesn't hate you either.

536
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:40,435
- Then why won't he...
- I've given up trying to understand him...

537
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:43,926
explain him, justify his ways.

538
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:47,418
Men do...
This is something you know very well.

539
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:49,681
Men do what... what men do.

540
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,559
Mummy?

541
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:56,779
I think he's writing us a letter.

542
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:00,002
I think he is writing us a letter,

543
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,570
but in another alphabet,
in Baekeland writing...

544
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:05,297
no one else can read.

545
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:08,673
- 'Cause the thing with Brooks is, he...
- Oh, please.

546
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:10,629
Mummy, don't be angry.

547
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:13,507
I'm not angry.

548
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:17,804
I love you.

549
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,643
Mummy, I love you.

550
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,548
- You've been fantastic.
- You needn't...

551
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,464
I wanted to, really.

552
00:47:46,502 --> 00:47:49,034
I can't begin to tell you
how much of an improvement...

553
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:51,989
Well, she'll be all right.

554
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:54,636
Well, she'll always be Barbara.

555
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:56,976
Yeah.

556
00:47:57,053 --> 00:48:00,199
And... what of you?

557
00:48:00,238 --> 00:48:03,192
What of life in the world
of Tony Baekeland?

558
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:05,187
<i>Ça va.</i>

559
00:48:07,028 --> 00:48:09,023
<i>"Ça va"?</i>

560
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,558
<i>"Pas mal"?</i>

561
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:12,822
No, no, no, no!

562
00:48:12,899 --> 00:48:15,085
That isn't good enough by half.

563
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:17,656
Tony takes care of Jake.

564
00:48:17,733 --> 00:48:20,035
Tony takes care of Barbara.

565
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:22,298
Someone must take care of Tony.

566
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,339
What I would like to do, ideally,
is to place you with a gallery.

567
00:49:39,415 --> 00:49:42,523
Or, failing that,
with a private dealer -

568
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,516
and that is something
I know I can do.

569
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:55,951
You shouldn't have done that.

570
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,018
Sam...

571
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:03,778
you should not have done that.

572
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:10,569
He's your child,
and he will always be your child,

573
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:14,482
but he is a grown man
with his own life and his own choices.

574
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,516
You don't know
what you're talking about.

575
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:20,429
Tony is who Tony is.

576
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:23,767
Tony is <i>not</i> who Tony is!

577
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:07,582
<i>Dear Papa,</i>

578
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,841
<i>I don't know any other way to say this</i>
<i>but straight out.</i>

579
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:15,063
<i>Would you please</i>
<i>come back to Mummy?</i>

580
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,672
<i>She's so unhappy.</i>

581
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,818
<i>She needs you...</i>

582
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,003
<i>but is too full of pride to ask.</i>

583
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:30,525
<i>Do you remember our dog</i>
<i>whom you named Giotto?</i>

584
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:34,515
<i>The dog is gone,</i>
<i>but the collar remains.</i>

585
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:39,042
<i>For all the times we've moved,</i>
<i>I've taken it from place to place.</i>

586
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,073
<i>It's never gotten lost,</i>
<i>not even once.</i>

587
00:51:46,524 --> 00:51:48,941
<i>I do not know why you fear me.</i>

588
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:52,701
<i>I do not fear you.</i>

589
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:58,648
<i>Sometimes I have a bloody mind</i>
<i>and I don't know what to do about it,</i>

590
00:51:58,725 --> 00:52:02,484
<i>but I fight it with everything I've got.</i>

591
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:06,359
<i>With my best love, Antony.</i>

592
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,081
Tony!

593
00:52:41,312 --> 00:52:42,885
Tony!

594
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:10,815
Brooks!

595
00:53:55,628 --> 00:53:59,349
Everything is going to be all right.

596
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:53,369
<i>My mummy told me,</i>
<i>ever since I was seven:</i>

597
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:55,671
<i>"Hold your head up high."</i>

598
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:07,488
<i>A very strange thing</i>
<i>is when your charm ceases...</i>

599
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:13,320
<i>and, for one reason or another,</i>
<i>you become gloomy.</i>

600
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:23,756
<i>And people cease to understand you</i>
<i>when you need understanding the most.</i>

601
00:55:33,347 --> 00:55:36,916
<i>I now realize that,</i>
<i>for many years,</i>

602
00:55:36,992 --> 00:55:39,294
<i>I have been living a totally false life.</i>

603
00:55:47,275 --> 00:55:49,538
<i>Anyway...</i>

604
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:54,296
<i>for Mummy's sake, I've decided</i>
<i>to make a new person of myself.</i>

605
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:19,437
We'll be bored rigid without you.

606
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:24,961
- It's harder to get people to come...
- Than it was in Cadaqués? I know.

607
00:58:25,038 --> 00:58:26,957
I know.

608
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:30,179
It's time.

609
00:58:34,285 --> 00:58:36,203
It's time.

610
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:02,829
I'm glad he's gone.

611
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,989
<i>I'm not sure, Papa,</i>
<i>you would want to know this,</i>

612
00:59:16,066 --> 00:59:19,864
<i>but she used sleeping suppositories,</i>
<i>six or seven of them,</i>

613
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:22,742
<i>so that she wouldn't</i>
<i>change her mind - couldn't.</i>

614
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:27,959
<i>I remember she told me that her father,</i>
<i>my grandfather, had killed himself,</i>

615
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:32,870
<i>so I fear that...</i>
<i>all this ran very deep within her.</i>

616
00:59:34,482 --> 00:59:36,592
<i>It was a miracle,</i>
<i>that I came home that night</i>

617
00:59:36,669 --> 00:59:41,042
<i>instead of staying out till morning,</i>
<i>as is my custom.</i>

618
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,263
<i>And a miracle that when I did come home</i>
<i>she was still alive.</i>

619
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:50,366
<i>Taking care of Mummy</i>
<i>had been your job.</i>

620
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:55,277
<i>But when you left, Brooks,</i>

621
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:58,768
<i>taking care of Mummy</i>
<i>became my inheritance.</i>

622
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,720
Barbara?

623
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,044
Hi.

624
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,154
We just missed each other.

625
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:02,725
<i>À l'hôpital?</i>

626
01:01:02,802 --> 01:01:04,950
They told me
that you had been there.

627
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:08,557
This... must be very hard for you.

628
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,578
Your music? Your writing?

629
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:17,074
That!

630
01:01:17,113 --> 01:01:20,182
Carlos thinks very highly of you -
always has.

631
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,558
- And I'm sure he'll...
- Have you seen Brooks?

632
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,704
Carlos saw him.

633
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:34,531
I don't think that Brooks
is liking me very much these days.

634
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:39,902
- He said I was a <i>crapule.</i>
- Oh, please!

635
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:44,199
To Brooks, <i>everyone</i> is a little shit.
Everyone in the whole wide world.

636
01:01:44,276 --> 01:01:48,305
Including me, including you.
Including even Carlos, for God's sake!

637
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:50,300
But not Leo.

638
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,482
Not the sainted grandfather.

639
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:02,193
- What was it he said?
- Who?

640
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,109
Hemingway, I think.
Or the other one...

641
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:08,025
- Fitzgerald?
- Yes. It was one of them.

642
01:02:08,102 --> 01:02:11,938
- Who said?
- What it is I'm trying to remember!

643
01:02:12,898 --> 01:02:14,356
God!

644
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:16,849
I'm turning into Nini.

645
01:02:16,888 --> 01:02:19,842
<i>Monsieur, encore.</i>
<i>Merci bien.</i>

646
01:02:20,763 --> 01:02:23,026
I know.
It was about Paris, I think.

647
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:26,710
"If you're tired of Paris,
you're tired of everything."

648
01:02:27,592 --> 01:02:29,664
I remember.

649
01:02:29,741 --> 01:02:32,503
"To say that one is tired of Paris

650
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:35,419
"is in fact to say
that one is tired of life."

651
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:38,949
Something like that.

652
01:02:39,025 --> 01:02:43,859
<i>Mummy hoped that with a new place</i>
<i>would come better things for us,</i>

653
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:46,775
<i>and she was right -
<i>but not completely so.</i>

654
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:51,226
<i>But still,</i>
<i>Paris was a step up in the world.</i>

655
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:55,216
<i>It was in Paris that I started</i>
<i>writing backwards in my notebook</i>

656
01:02:55,293 --> 01:02:58,017
<i>so that no one could</i>
<i>read my thoughts.</i>

657
01:02:59,283 --> 01:03:02,429
<i>But Mummy seemed to be able</i>
<i>to read them anyway,</i>

658
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:06,304
<i>as if she were inside my head,</i>
<i>looking out.</i>

659
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,783
<i>My great-grandfather Leo once said:</i>

660
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,510
<i>"One of the uses of money is</i>

661
01:03:16,548 --> 01:03:20,922
<i>"that it allows us not to live with</i>
<i>the consequences of our mistakes. "

662
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:25,564
<i>But I fear that, in this,</i>
<i>Leo was wrong.</i>

663
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:30,015
Tony?

664
01:03:30,053 --> 01:03:32,854
Do you know
what I would really love?

665
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,383
What would you really love?

666
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,378
What do you think?

667
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,829
- This is so good.
- I'm glad.

668
01:03:43,788 --> 01:03:46,320
It's exactly what I wanted.

669
01:03:46,397 --> 01:03:49,275
Well, then I'm all the more glad
I was able to obtain it.

670
01:03:49,351 --> 01:03:52,843
Is there a better ice cream
in the whole world?

671
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,332
- Is it Thursday?
- Yes, it is.

672
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:02,665
I have dinner with Ethel tonight.

673
01:04:02,741 --> 01:04:05,389
- Ethel de Croisset.
- I'll make other plans.

674
01:04:05,465 --> 01:04:07,998
- She won't mind if you tag along.
- I don't want to impose.

675
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:12,103
I don't like what happens
when you "make other plans."

676
01:04:12,179 --> 01:04:14,788
Mummy... please.

677
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:19,201
The afternoon
of the longest laundry?

678
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:22,116
- I don't do that anymore.
- Mmm... Hm!

679
01:04:24,188 --> 01:04:26,337
What does the G stand for?

680
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,442
- What, dear?
- The G.

681
01:04:31,823 --> 01:04:34,509
"George" - like his father.

682
01:04:38,269 --> 01:04:40,571
Do my wrists, would you?

683
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:43,799
That was lovely.

684
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:46,677
And now...

685
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,513
I need some privacy.

686
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:56,805
Scoot, so that I can get dressed.

687
01:06:05,054 --> 01:06:07,164
Teeny. I'm so sorry.

688
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,919
<i>Mummy always said that I should be</i>
<i>furious with you for stealing my girl.</i>

689
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:15,029
<i>But I said:</i>

690
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:17,753
<i>"Mummy, he didn't hurt me.</i>

691
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,710
<i>"He hurt you."</i>

692
01:06:19,787 --> 01:06:22,281
<i>Still, Papa,</i>
<i>you should have come back.</i>

693
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:26,616
<i>I thought that one day</i>
<i>you'd wake up and know that, too.</i>

694
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,148
<i>But you never did.</i>

695
01:06:31,297 --> 01:06:34,136
<i>And something else</i>
<i>I want you to know:</i>

696
01:06:34,174 --> 01:06:37,167
<i>Giotto's collar has disappeared,</i>

697
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:41,195
<i>and I will not be able to sleep</i>
<i>until we find it.</i>

698
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:40,664
Not the formal opening dinner -

699
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:45,038
that's me and 17 of the dealer's
closest friends getting pissed at Regine's.

700
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:48,491
This is different, more <i>intime.</i>

701
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:53,056
I was thinking that after the vernissage
I would gather together a small group -

702
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:56,854
you and Mishka, of course,
and Ethel de Croisset and the Duráns

703
01:07:56,931 --> 01:08:00,768
and Bill and Rose Styron,
if they are still in town.

704
01:08:00,845 --> 01:08:03,607
Not buyers -
not... not a business thing.

705
01:08:03,684 --> 01:08:05,602
- Thank you.
- People you love,

706
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:07,712
and who I know would love each other.

707
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:11,012
I can't begin to tell you
how much Tony adores London.

708
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,580
I believe it's brought about
a sea change in him.

709
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,649
Do you remember, in Paris,
how down he could get,

710
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,990
how... pulled within himself?

711
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:21,985
And then, in the morning,
how agitated?

712
01:08:22,061 --> 01:08:24,287
Well... that's still Tony,
of course.

713
01:08:24,363 --> 01:08:28,085
But in London he eats,
he walks, he even shops.

714
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:31,384
This morning we stayed in bed until 11
reading the newspapers.

715
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:33,993
For him, that's unheard of.
For me, paradise.

716
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,175
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

717
01:08:39,211 --> 01:08:42,588
What do you think, Mishka,
of a small dinner following the vernissage?

718
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,081
What's not to like?
It sounds like a great idea.

719
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:47,460
Well, I was thinking
I might have it here.

720
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,913
I thought it might add
a note of class to my own little works,

721
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,062
which they in no way,
on their own merits...

722
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,745
Of course you can have
your little dinner over here.

723
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:00,965
I don't know how to thank you.

724
01:09:02,423 --> 01:09:05,032
Tony will be thrilled.

725
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:14,969
Well? Where is it?

726
01:09:18,384 --> 01:09:20,455
Where is it?

727
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:22,412
Where did you put it?

728
01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:25,865
It is not my responsibility
to keep track of your objects.

729
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,860
But it's not anywhere.

730
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:31,467
Missy Harnden
is the soul of graciousness.

731
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:34,958
When I mentioned that there would be
a vernissage after the opening,

732
01:09:35,035 --> 01:09:39,946
she offered to host a little dinner...
<i>chez</i> Harnden.

733
01:09:39,984 --> 01:09:41,979
I'm so happy for you, Mummy.

734
01:09:42,056 --> 01:09:45,125
I like the way you've been dressing lately.
Is that from Gieves?

735
01:09:45,202 --> 01:09:48,885
No. Actually, it's from Anderson,
from Anderson & Sheppard.

736
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:52,031
- Did you just walk in?
- No. You might just walk into Gieves,

737
01:09:52,108 --> 01:09:55,945
but you're not going to walk into Anderson -
you get walked into Anderson.

738
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:58,707
In my case,
by Timothy Chalmers.

739
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:02,812
Have you been seeing a lot
of young Timothy Chalmers?

740
01:10:04,846 --> 01:10:07,915
I don't think he's the kind of person
you want to learn from,

741
01:10:07,992 --> 01:10:10,370
if what you want to learn
is how to be a man.

742
01:10:12,672 --> 01:10:16,701
- What do you mean?
- I don't think Timothy likes women much.

743
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:19,387
Oh, he's English, is all.

744
01:10:20,192 --> 01:10:23,185
He's the kind of person
that does things for people -

745
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:26,791
in the way that Missy Harnden
does for you.

746
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:29,170
I hope you haven't incurred
any obligation.

747
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,930
Mother, we're talking about
an introduction to a tailor, a clothier.

748
01:10:33,007 --> 01:10:37,189
Well, I very much like
this material... this fabric.

749
01:10:39,913 --> 01:10:43,135
- What would you call it?
- It's a worsted, I should think.

750
01:10:43,212 --> 01:10:45,399
It's much nicer than
your other worsted.

751
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:48,008
Well, that's Anderson.

752
01:10:52,037 --> 01:10:53,955
This is interesting.

753
01:10:55,643 --> 01:10:59,058
Barbara... please.

754
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:03,777
You don't seem to mind it.
Part of you doesn't seem to mind it.

755
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:08,074
I suppose I don't... mind.

756
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:11,258
- You might even enjoy it.
- I might.

757
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:13,944
Ah, I'm finding some buttons here.

758
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:18,970
- How many?
- Five.

759
01:11:19,047 --> 01:11:21,349
- They do them with five.
- That's five.

760
01:11:22,998 --> 01:11:24,917
That's four.

761
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:27,909
That's three.

762
01:11:31,055 --> 01:11:33,242
Hold that thought.

763
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:47,898
God...

764
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,926
I like the boxers you've chosen.

765
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:10,803
I picked them out for myself.

766
01:12:28,529 --> 01:12:30,447
How does that feel?

767
01:12:30,524 --> 01:12:32,595
I think you know.

768
01:13:39,929 --> 01:13:42,768
Did you come?

769
01:13:42,845 --> 01:13:44,341
No.

770
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,204
We can do something about that.

771
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,142
You're the best.

772
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:51,099
You are.

773
01:14:52,212 --> 01:14:54,821
You are the best.

774
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,003
Are you sure
you didn't put it anywhere?

775
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:22,636
Why do you care so much
about this thing?

776
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:26,089
For the same reason that
anyone cares about anything -

777
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:29,811
for its value,
its sentimental value.

778
01:15:29,888 --> 01:15:31,960
We are talking about a dog collar...

779
01:15:32,036 --> 01:15:35,067
We are talking about a collar
that belonged to Giotto,

780
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:38,443
- a dog I loved, and a dog that died!
- Inside voice, please.

781
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,091
Now the dog is gone,
but we still have the collar,

782
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:44,122
and we have moved
and moved and moved,

783
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:45,925
and we have never lost it!

784
01:15:46,002 --> 01:15:47,920
Oh, Tony, please.

785
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:55,095
Go look for it.

786
01:15:59,085 --> 01:16:00,658
Go!

787
01:16:36,262 --> 01:16:38,142
Tony?

788
01:16:39,753 --> 01:16:41,672
Tony!

789
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,798
Get your thumb
out of your mouth.

790
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:55,253
You are not a fucking baby!

791
01:17:05,612 --> 01:17:07,723
You hid it.

792
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:14,744
You hid it in the cupboard. At the very back
of the cupboard, with Nini's silver.

793
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,389
- I did no such thing.
- Then how did it get there?

794
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:21,228
Well, maybe you put it there
for safekeeping,

795
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:23,568
and then you forgot.

796
01:17:37,457 --> 01:17:40,066
Everything's gonna be all right.

797
01:17:43,711 --> 01:17:46,895
Let me help you. Tony. Tony...

798
01:18:05,656 --> 01:18:11,181
After we fought this morning
you wrote something on a piece of paper.

799
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,330
And I was so angry...

800
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:18,049
that when you went out for lunch
I just had to tear it up.

801
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:22,346
We didn't fight this morning. We stayed in
and read the papers, remember?

802
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:28,446
You wrote it
in that backwards writing.

803
01:18:28,868 --> 01:18:30,863
But I'm not stupid.

804
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:34,853
I know that you think
I'm not smart, but I'm...

805
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:39,112
smart enough to know that
if there is a piece of backward writing...

806
01:18:41,376 --> 01:18:43,716
...why, you just hold it up to a mirror.

807
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:50,123
So I tore it into little pieces,
and I flushed it down the toilet.

808
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:56,300
But you know how that toilet is, and
those pieces kept... kept floating to the top.

809
01:18:56,377 --> 01:18:59,945
I don't know what you're talking about.
When you talk nonsense I can't...

810
01:19:00,022 --> 01:19:02,094
- I'm not talking...
- I can't help you.

811
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,664
- I am telling you!
- You are spouting!

812
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,802
I'm going to call an ambulance.

813
01:20:14,607 --> 01:20:16,180
Yes.

814
01:20:17,024 --> 01:20:20,899
83... Cadogan Square.

815
01:20:23,815 --> 01:20:25,618
Thank you.

816
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,779
Yes, I'd like to place an order.

817
01:20:56,081 --> 01:20:57,999
To be delivered.

818
01:20:59,918 --> 01:21:01,836
Yes. Baekeland.

819
01:21:05,442 --> 01:21:07,361
I'm very hungry.

820
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:13,576
Yeah, those thin rice noodles
with pork, shredded pork.

821
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:17,758
Yeah, that would be it.

822
01:21:17,835 --> 01:21:20,520
And some rice, some fried rice.

823
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:23,973
No, the large.

824
01:21:35,483 --> 01:21:37,363
<i>Dear Papa,</i>

825
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,241
<i>I'm hoping you receive this letter.</i>

826
01:21:46,303 --> 01:21:48,681
<i>During the time</i>
<i>preceding what happened</i>

827
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,019
<i>a lot of rather strange things</i>
<i>were happening.</i>

828
01:21:52,096 --> 01:21:53,938
<i>Earlier that afternoon</i>

829
01:21:53,976 --> 01:21:59,156
<i>I had a telephone call</i>
<i>from a friend of ours who lives in Wales.</i>

830
01:21:59,232 --> 01:22:02,800
<i>She told me</i>
<i>I had fallen down an elevator shaft.</i>

831
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,829
<i>I thought this rather strange.</i>

832
01:22:06,906 --> 01:22:09,937
<i>And yet it had</i>
<i>a profound effect on me.</i>

833
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,380
<i>I was in a dreadful state.</i>

834
01:22:18,876 --> 01:22:22,521
<i>For a long time</i>
<i>I didn't know where I was.</i>

835
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:25,629
<i>Past memories</i>
<i>kept flooding my mind,</i>

836
01:22:25,705 --> 01:22:30,041
<i>and I felt like I was re-enacting</i>
<i>parts of my former life.</i>

837
01:22:31,307 --> 01:22:36,985
<i>You know I loved, and still love and adore,</i>
<i>Mummy more than anyone in the world.</i>

838
01:22:37,023 --> 01:22:38,942
Hello?

839
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,625
Hello?

840
01:22:43,738 --> 01:22:45,656
Mr. Baekeland?

841
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:52,715
You would be Mr. Baekeland, sir?

842
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:54,634
Yes.

843
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:58,010
- And this would be?
- My mother.

844
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:06,336
<i>I do wish</i>
<i>we could all be together again.</i>

845
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:12,321
<i>And another thing is,</i>
<i>I have so much in my head that...</i>

846
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,889
<i>to let it out would surely kill me.</i>

847
01:23:17,232 --> 01:23:20,493
<i>Nevertheless, I feel better now...</i>

848
01:23:21,682 --> 01:23:26,862
<i>and even feel that a great weight</i>
<i>has been lifted from my shoulders.</i>

849
01:23:34,497 --> 01:23:39,101
Does anyone know who died?
Is it someone famous?

850
01:23:39,177 --> 01:23:41,633
No. They said to move on.

851
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,551
<i>Yes, it is very boring here,</i>

852
01:23:43,628 --> 01:23:46,429
<i>but I try to be good</i>
<i>and not to fret.</i>

853
01:23:50,879 --> 01:23:55,138
<i>And you ask me what it's like</i>
<i>to be in prison. Well...</i>

854
01:23:55,215 --> 01:23:57,900
<i>just exactly as one would imagine.</i>

855
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:09,142
<i> There will be a Mass given</i>
<i>by Barbara's friends who knew her well</i>

856
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:13,132
<i>and remember</i>
<i>what was lovable and brave in her</i>

857
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:16,201
<i>at St. Mary's,</i>
<i>Cadogan Gardens,</i>

858
01:24:16,278 --> 01:24:20,230
<i>at 6:30 p.m. on November 30.</i>

859
01:24:21,726 --> 01:24:25,217
<i>She would have been happy</i>
<i>to know you had been there, too.</i>

860
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:54,113
<i># Let's get out of town</i>

861
