1
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:55,954
If you're watching this,
you've discovered something
you shouldn't have.

2
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:04,997
Anyway, um--

3
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:12,104
This-- This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,940
Yeah.
I can't remember her name
to save my life,

5
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,210
but she had the bluest eyes
I've ever seen.

6
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:23,048
The only other time
I remember seeing this exact
intensity of blue...

7
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,984
was the day
my sister drowned.

8
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,186
It was everywhere.

9
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:31,857
It was in the water,
in the sky, Nicole's skin.

10
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,393
Blue.
I remember.

11
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,661
And gold.

12
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,931
The gold of the light
off the surface of the water.

13
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:43,268
Like an empty frame
flashing onto the screen.

14
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,405
Nicole.

15
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,141
She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

16
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,344
But I-- I think
she's the problem.

17
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:58,117
I think she's the reason
I am the way I am, right?

18
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,789
Maybe I should back up
and try to explain
what the hell happened here.

19
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,560
<i>Jesus Christ.
What the hell
did happen here?</i>

20
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,028
<i>Um--</i>

21
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,798
Well, let's start with me.

22
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,833
My name is Kevin Wolfe.

23
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,001
I'm a studio photographer.

24
00:03:56,003 --> 00:04:01,139
I do head shots,
and most of my clients
are girls.

25
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,874
Girls.

26
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,844
They've sort of been the focus
of my whole fucking life.

27
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,112
They're sort of
a problem for me.

28
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,849
I've just been trying
to find a way to forget
all the bad experiences...

29
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,585
and try to have
at least one good one, so...

30
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,954
every girl that comes
into this studio--

31
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,958
every actress, every model--

32
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,393
I ask out.

33
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,829
Would you like
to see a movie?

34
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,031
And they almost always say--

35
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,799

No.

36
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,235
And so, I do
this forgetting thing.

37
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,169
It's like a ritual.

38
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:34,773
I mean, I know it sounds weird,
but you gotta do
something positive...

39
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:39,077
to cancel out
the negative experiences,
right?

40
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,079
Um, for instance,

41
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,950
I forgot Theresa
by going to Coney Island.

42
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,586
And before Theresa
there was Carrie,

43
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,755
who decided to stand me up
at the movies.

44
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:55,027
<i>Forgot her
by watching every single
episode of Lost on DVD.</i>

45
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,231
And then, uh--

46
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,099
Then there was Sheila.

47
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,834
She was a real girl, you know?

48
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,903
Not like most actresses--
not fake.

49
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:09,374
Although she does look
really overdone here.

50
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,442
My assistant Jamie,

51
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,911
she sometimes went
a little crazy with the makeup.

52
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,448
Anyway, I remember asking--
Are you single?

53
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,152
Um, I'm only 19.

54
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,687
Oh.

55
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:26,391
Um, do you have
a-- a boyfriend?

56
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,194
Oh, no. No, I don't.

57
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,031
Maybe we could go
to a-a movie sometime?

58
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,268
Uh--


59
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,236
Sure.

60
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,106
Yeah. Uh, sure.
Um--

61
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,275
I-- I like movies.

62
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:46,345
A lot of girls have
a hard time saying no,

63
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,314
especially if they're from Iowa
or some fucking place.

64
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,216
It's like they're trying
to be polite all the time.

65
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,286
But, anyway, she called
the day we were supposed
to go out...

66
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,620
and she said she'd forgotten
about other plans.

67
00:05:55,622 --> 00:06:00,692
Some relative was in
from out of town, I think,
or something, blah, blah, blah.

68
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,362
I forgot her
by going to the newsstand.

69
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,831
Flipping through
the fashion magazines,

70
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,767
the pictures of
the skinny supermodels,

71
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,971
the emaciated
and beautiful.

72
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:20,712
And then, uh,
there are the ones who are
not so easy to forget...

73
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,615
because they are the ones
who said--

74
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,417
Yes.

75
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,219
Okay.

76
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,262
This looks great.
Thanks.

77
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:40,165
It's a great smile.

78
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,535
Have you done
a lot of acting?

79
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,704
I mean, theater or--

80
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:49,341
Um, a few years ago,
I went on some auditions.

81
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,743
And then I met this guy,

82
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,912
and... now I'm a hostess.

83
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,483

But I'm planning on
getting back into it.

84
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,454
How old are you?

85
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,022
How old am I?

86
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,759
Why do you want to know
how old I am?

87
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,929
Where'd you grow up?

88
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,731
Who said I ever grew up?

89
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,766
Oh.

90
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,301
Well, where'd you
go to school?

91
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:20,739
You know, usually, how
this works is that I'm usually
the one asking questions.

92
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,174
Oh.

93
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:25,544

What are you doing tonight?

94
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,213
What am I doing?

95
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,383
Do you want to go out
with me, Kevin?

96
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,885
Oh, like what?
Like a movie?

97
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,056
I was thinking
more like a bar.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,493
Okay.

99
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,472
Kevin.

100
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,613
I had a bad dream.

101
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,040
Oh, my God.

102
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:08,380
- Good morning.
- Are you taking pictures
of me?

103
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,282
Taking one picture.
Here.

104
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,484
See? You look beautiful.


105
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:14,553
Not likely.
Yeah, you do.

106
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,856
Oh, God.

107
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,693
What time is it?

108
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,100
Oh, my God.

109
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,970
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

110
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,372
Get the wrong idea?

111
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,208
What wrong idea?

112
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,977
Um--

113
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,416
Yeah. I mean,
I can't believe
that I, like--

114
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,418
Listen, I'm not, uh--

115
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,322
I'm not the type of person
that just wants to--

116
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,924
Uh, fuck.

117
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,996
Listen, I know that--
I know that I really don't
know you at all, Adrienne.

118
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,099
I can't even think
of your last name
at the moment.

119
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,302
But-- And it's safe to say
that you don't know me,

120
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,971
but...

121
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,240
I really feel
that we made this--

122
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,209
this connection.

123
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,011
Right?

124
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,780
Uh, a connection?
Yeah.

125
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,883
I mean, you're here,
I'm here,

126
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:23,755
and I just feel
like there's this--
there's a spark.

127
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:27,759
I mean, what I want,
really, is just--

128
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,961
I just want a girl,
you know?

129
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,199
I mean, I'm just a guy.
I mean, I'm not, like,
a fashion photographer.

130
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,102
It's nothing glamorous.
I just do head shots, you know--

131
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,405
300 a digital set,
prints are extra.

132
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,642
It's the deal I gave you,
essentially.
Yeah.

133
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,543
Um, hey, listen.

134
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:51,816
Yesterday was, like,
a really, um, weird day for me.

135
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,719
So--

136
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,222
Mmm.
Yeah.

137
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,024
Okay.

138
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,192
Sh-- Coffee?
Do you want coffee?

139
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,995
I could go down
to the corner--
No, thanks.

140
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,897
No, thanks.

141
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,600
You have to go to work?

142
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,935
Work. Yeah, I do.
Work.

143
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,706
Can I, um-- Can I
call you sometime?

144
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,977
Um, did I give you my number?

145
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,715
Oh. Wow.

146
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,884
Uh, yeah, you gave it
to Jamie on the card...

147
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:31,423
so that I could call you
when the pictures were ready.
Oh! Right, right.

148
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,630
Awkward.
Okay.

149
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,465
Thanks!

150
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,170
Fuck. Fucking fuck.

151
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,839
I am such a fucking idiot.
Oh, my God.

152
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,042
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
how stupid I am.

153
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:56,347
No idea how
to talk to people--
girls in particular.

154
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,719
Hi. I really think we had
this connection, right?


155
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,989
Hi! We have a connection.
I really think, uh--

156
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,742
Stupid.
I'm so fucking stupid.
I'm stupid.

157
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:28,513
I'm such a fucking moron.
I'm such a fucking dumb-ass
piece of shit.

158
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,116
Fucking brain--

159
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,786
Hey.

160
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,554
Hi.

161
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,824
Do you wanna go camping?

162
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,593
Uh, Derek and me were--

163
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,730
Derek and I
are going camping,
and we want you to go.

164
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:51,202
And I was thinking
you could do some of
your nature photography.

165
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:56,941
You know,
if you don't want to,
that is totally fine.

166
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,043
Please tell me
you're kidding, right?

167
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,280
Yeah. 
I was kidding.
You're kidding.

168
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,949
Yeah. I got you.
You got me.

169
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,087
I'm going to
go set up now.
Okay.

170
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,449
Do you have any pictures
to show me?

171
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,218
Nah.

172
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,653
You never show me
your pictures.

173
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,122

They're just girls.

174
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,124
They're just...
head shots.

175
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,262
They're boring, Ruby.
They'd bore you.

176
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,465
Girls are nice.


177
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,968
You wouldn't like 'em.
Trust me, Ruby.

178
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,237
You wouldn't like
any of 'em.

179
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,039
They're not dirty pictures,
are they?

180
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,307
Come on.

181
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:40,478
I've seen those magazines.
I know what all kinds of
pictures they have out there.

182
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,914
They're not dirty.
You're taking dirty pictures!

183
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:48,286
You are crazy, Ruby.
You are a crazy old woman.

184
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,957
You shouldn't call me Ruby.
You should call me Grandma.

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,463
Ruby, can I see
the pictures of Nicole?

186
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,311
She wasn't supposed to be
called "Nicole," you know,

187
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,581
because that was
your mother's name.

188
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,216
I know.

189
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:22,153
But when she died,
we thought it was fitting.

190
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,357
Just a newborn baby,
and a little girl and all.

191
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,893
Such a pretty little baby.

192
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:33,031
It was fitting she should
have your mother's name.

193
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,165
Oh, your mother--

194
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:38,670
I guess it was just
one of those things.

195
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:42,640
They said they
couldn't have known.

196
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:48,212
And I thought
I could console myself
with little Nicole.

197
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,785
You're all I've got left.

198
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,255
Fuck.

199
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,292
It's not that you're
a bad guy or anything.

200
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,963
I mean, you seem like
you're really nice.

201
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,065
It's just--
I don't know--

202
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,368
like you seem
kind of like, um--

203
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,240
You know, like, with
the whole connection thing?

204
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,178
And then, plus, the mood
that I was in when we--

205
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:33,851
You know, um, I was kind of
acting something out.

206
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,454
I mean, you--
you asked me out,
you know.

207
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:39,157
Why would you ask me out?
I mean, I don't--

208
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,458
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,395
It's not something
that you should do
lightly, you know.

210
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,868
You know what?
Thank you for the head shots.

211
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,172
I, uh-- Yeah, I have some,
uh, extra prints in here,
if you want them.

212
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:58,543
And I ended up using
one of them, actually,
for my flyer.

213
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,178
I hope that doesn't
bother you.

214
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,681
Oh, no, it's fine.
And these are fine.

215
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:04,949
Yeah.
Um--

216
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,219
It is fine.
It's gonna be fine.
It's totally fine.

217
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,155
It's, uh-- Don't even
feel bad about it.

218
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,491
You know,
I know a lot of girls.

219
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,760
Um, it's just--

220
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,796
I felt... I felt like
we had a, uh--

221
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,698
Hey, Kevin.

222
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,103
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,372
Me too.

224
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:32,276
You know when you're
in a museum and you're
looking at a painting,

225
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,812
and it's really
freaking you out?

226
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:38,416
It's all jagged and awful,
and it gets inside you?

227
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:43,020
Then you just turn your head
and walk through the door...

228
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:46,090
into another room
of the museum,

229
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,959
and you're looking
at another painting--

230
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:54,398
a calculation of colors,
abstract and meaningless,
but beautiful.

231
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,601
So beautiful.

232
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:59,070
Just waiting for you...

233
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,306
if you just walk through.

234
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,283
Hi.

235
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,752
Uh, my name's Kevin Wolfe.
I'm a studio photographer.

236
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:18,556
I do head shots,
$300 a digital set.
Prints are extra.

237
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,392
You've probably
seen my flyers--

238
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,894
all over the city?

239
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,030
No?
Sounds like you've said that
a few times before.

240
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:30,201

Yeah, I think I even
say it in my sleep.

241
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,336
Well, I mean, it's okay
if you haven't seen 'em.

242
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,140
It's probably not something
you'd pay attention to anyway.

243
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,777
I mean, unless, of course,
you know, you wanted to
get head shots, right?

244
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,812
I mean, are you,
uh, an actor?

245
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,183
Yeah, uh,
actually, I need some.

246
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,984
Yeah?

247
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,754
I'm Beth.

248
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,156
Beth, uh--
Beth Dalewell.

249
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,358
Beth Dalewell.

250
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,261
Are you, uh, enjoying
the play so far?

251
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:01,232
Yeah. Uh, so far
it's all right.

252
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,801
Just all right?
Yeah.

253
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,437
I don't know.
It's kind of embarrassing,
isn't it?

254
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:10,675
I mean, the guy's
walking around in white tights
pretending to be a swan.

255
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,444
I don't know.
We're actually supposed
to believe he is one.

256
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:17,982
Yeah.



257
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:23,120
Did-- Did you produce it
or something?

258
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,022
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I mean--

259
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,226
I did the head shots
for someone in that cast.

260
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,729
Yep. And plus,
I'm just a fan
of the theater.

261
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,067
Oh, fuck.
I can't believe
I just said that.

262
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,071
"I'm a fan of the theater."

263
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,806
"The theater."

264
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,975
I'm sorry.
I'm just an idiot.

265
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,944
No, you're--
you're funny.

266
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,946
I'm funny? What do you--
What do you mean?

267
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,583
I don't know. You're just--
You're just funny.

268
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,487
So--

269
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:20,278
Are you, um,
coming from Kevin's?

270
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,981
Uh, yeah.
Just picking up
some head shots.

271
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,816
Photos.

272
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,121
Are you an actress?

273
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,090

I'd like to be.

274
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,031
What do you do?

275
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,667
Nothing.

276
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:45,069
Really?


277
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:50,007
I'm sort of the--
the landlord.

278
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,976
Oh.

279
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,982
I feel like I'm just
like this worthless
piece of shit...

280
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,152
that, like, exists in the world
for absolutely no reason.

281
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:05,189
And, like, I should
just essentially be dead,
and everyone would be happier.

282
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,058
Like everyone else
has a reason to be alive,

283
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,962
and I'm just, like,
this worthless failure
that has no... point.

284
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,464
Okay, Jamie.
James. Listen.

285
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,732
I look in the mirror,
and I'm just like--

286
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:18,636
I just feel like I'm so ugly
and hideous, and I--


287
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:22,573
Jamie, listen.
You're not hideous, Jamie.
You're not ugly at all.

288
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,242
Will you-- Will you stop
being so negative?

289
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,577
<i>Why don't you try
being positive?</i>

290
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,146
<i>Think about--
Think about anything.
I know, Derek.</i>

291
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:33,217
I know it is your job
to talk me down, okay?

292
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,553
And--


293
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:39,156
I'm not gonna
drink anything, okay?

294
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,826
And thank you, you know?
Thank you.

295
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,928
You're like
my only friend
in the entire world,

296
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,665
and that is why I call you,
because you're nice, you know?

297
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:51,769
You're a very, very,
very nice sponsor.

298
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:54,772
I'm really gla--
Can you hold on?

299
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,308
I have another call.

300
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,912
Hi, honey.

301
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,317
<i>Hi, Mom.
I didn't interrupt
anything?</i>

302
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,753
<i>No.
I can call you back
if you want.</i>

303
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,887
<i>No.
What are you doing?</i>

304
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,824
I was just on the other line
with the suicide hotline, so--

305
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,494
<i>Really?
Yeah. They said
I should do it.</i>

306
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:19,029
<i>Oh, my God, Jamie.
Are you okay?
I'm kidding.</i>

307
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,766
<i>I'm kidding, Mom.
Why would you
scare me like that?</i>

308
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,934
Can you please
hold on for a second?

309
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,736
The swan started crying,
you know?

310
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,940
The dancing was one thing,
and then-- and then, yeah.

311
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:24,862
Hi.
Hey.

312
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,631
So, I still need you
to get me a key
for the downstairs,

313
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,501
and then you wouldn't
have to buzz me in
every time I come to work.

314
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:33,037
I don't mind it,
but since I already have
the upstairs key,

315
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,506
and I know it bothers you--
I keep forgetting
about that.

316
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,908
Would you mind making
some coffee, please?
Yes.

317
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,111
So... you know how
I was telling you
Derek is gay?

318
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:45,783
I know you knew he was gay,
but all of my best friends
are always gay.

319
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,652
"Fag hag."
That's what they used to
call me in high school.

320
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,488
Because my best friend
was gay-- Tony.

321
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,722
Oh, my God.
You would like Tony.

322
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,792
The weird thing is
is that I have never known
any lesbians.

323
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,694
I mean, I don't think
I'd get along with one.

324
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,262
Although,
who's to judge?
I don't know.

325
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,564
Maybe I've known
a lot of lesbians
and didn't know. God.

326
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,101
If I was friends with lesbians
in high school, they couldn't
have called me "fag hag."

327
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:09,106
They'd have to call me
something else like
"lesbi-friend." 

328
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,741
Oh, shit.

329
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,710
You didn't think,
a minute ago,

330
00:25:12,712 --> 00:25:14,879
that I was saying
I thought you were gay,

331
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,680
'cause that is not
what I was saying.

332
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,384
I would not want you
to think-- That's not--

333
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,785
Wow.

334
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,787
So, yeah, Derek
is not my boyfriend,

335
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,858
and I wouldn't even want
Derek to be my boyfriend
even if he wasn't gay.

336
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,163
I mean-- You know what I'm saying?
Kevin?

337
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,470
Sorry.


338
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,441
Jesus Christ, Tanner.
It's dark as hell in here.

339
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:44,975
Sorry.

340
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:49,246
I need to borrow your--
your car this weekend.
Is that all right?

341
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,883
What have you got
in your hand?

342
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,420
Just pictures.
Photographs.

343
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,255
Let's see.

344
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,056
I don't think so.

345
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:03,894
If you want
to borrow the Impala,
show me the pictures.

346
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,506
That's a good boy.

347
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,909
Mmm.
Mmm.

348
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,812
I saw this one on the poster.

349
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,982
Wait a minute.
You mean you actually
left your apartment?

350
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,718

Hilarious.

351
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,723
Did you fuck her?

352
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,694
Let's look at yours.

353
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,597
Mine are better.
Yeah, I'm sure.

354
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,134
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

355
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,740
Aw! God.

356
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,443
Look at this one.
What is--
What is that?

357
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,712
That's a fish.

358
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,246
Why would she--

359
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,749
Look at this one.

360
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,285
Yeah. Oh.

361
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,120
Where do you get
this shit?

362
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,390
Come on, Kevin.
This is beautiful.

363
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,726
You're so fucked up.

364
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,527
Yeah.

365
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,064
Can I keep this?

366
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,835
Yeah, it's yours.

367
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,204
Thanks.

368
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,239
Don't you want this?

369
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,475
No.
Why?

370
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,678
What'd you do to her?

371
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,349
I guess I scared her.

372
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,351
Yeah, apparently.

373
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,720
Apparently,
I do that sometimes.

374
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,693
Anyway, Adrienne's memory
played on in my psyche...

375
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:46,797
like one of those
extended remixes...

376
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,235
over and over and over.

377
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,203
How did I forget her?

378
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,307
<i>Hello?
Hey, it's Kevin.</i>

379
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:01,812
<i>You, uh-- You still
going camping?</i>

380
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:02,413
Yes.

381
00:28:02,415 --> 00:28:05,149
So I'm pretty much not sure
what I'm going to call it yet.

382
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,918
It could either be
a "uni-peg" or a "pega-corn,"

383
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,722
or I could just call it
something really simple
like "flying horse with horn."

384
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,891
You know what I mean?
If I just need to
keep it simple.

385
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:17,928
But basically, it's like
the most incredible animal
that's ever existed.

386
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,797
It's half unicorn,
half Pegasus.

387
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,567
So it's like a flying horse
with wings and a horn.

388
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,604
I can't even tell you
how important the Pegasus
on its own, without a horn,

389
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,406
has been essentially
since I was, like, born.

390
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,675
'Cause when I was a kid,
I had this game called
Dark Tower.

391
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,211
It's, like, there's this tower,
and it's called
the Dark Tower.

392
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,481
And there's all these things
like Brigands-- I think
the Brigand is the bad guy.

393
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,616
Then there's this other--
like you have rations.

394
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,452
Oh, yeah. And you go
to the Bazaar.

395
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,087
It spins around,
and I don't know--
Jamie.

396
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:48,625
Could you stop, like--
Could you stop talking, please?
For like a second.

397
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,694
- I'm sorry.
- 

398
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,830
I'm really sorry.
No, don't be sorry.

399
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,666
You just-- You make me
nervous, I guess.

400
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,835
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

401
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,971
There isn't?
No. I like you, okay?

402
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:04,608
Just-- with the talking,
please just be calm, okay?

403
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,944
For an exercise.
Because I want
to be quiet.

404
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:11,148
I mean, I really do.
It's like I want my mouth
to just die.

405
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,016
But then, like,
all of a sudden,
it's back.

406
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:16,019
It resurrects like Christ,
and then it's like--
Jamie!

407
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,387
Please!
I am begging you.

408
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,490
Sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

409
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,258
I'll shut up.

410
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,935
She told me how she feels
about you, Kevin.

411
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,940
You might take that
into consideration.

412
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,245
What are you talking about?

413
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,783
Jamie's... very fragile.

414
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,188
I'm not saying
she'd do anything, but--

415
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,493
Just do me a favor
and be nice to her.

416
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,895
Yeah.

417
00:29:57,897 --> 00:30:00,564
Yeah, of course.

418
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:27,324
Everybody loves him.
He's very talented.

419
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,738
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

420
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:47,010
Tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet!

421
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:51,048
I'm sorry.
Tweet, tweet.

422
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,219
Tweet, tweet!

423
00:30:56,588 --> 00:31:00,657
In the end, I did end up
forgetting Theresa...

424
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,395
and Doris and Allison
and Sheila and Adrienne...

425
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,730
and-- and all of them.

426
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,999
I mean, it's not that
I forgot them literally though.

427
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:14,504
It's just I made it
so I didn't care anymore.

428
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,175
See? That's a picture
of me not caring.

429
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,845
Ah, anyway, um,

430
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:26,850
I decided I had to
try to remember more
about my sister Nicole,

431
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,018
what happened.

432
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,754
Try to really find
the answer this time,

433
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:36,960
try to figure out...
why I'm like this.

434
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,937
All right, Ruby.
Are you comfortable?

435
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,874
What do you
want me to do?

436
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:55,512
Well, I just-- I want
to record you, okay?

437
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:57,681
I want to--

438
00:31:57,683 --> 00:32:02,886
I want to record
some of your stories
about the old days...

439
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,554
because, uh--

440
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,858
I mean, what happens
when you're gone, right?

441
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,060
I mean,
no one's gonna know
what you know.

442
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:13,697
So, I just want you
to talk, all right?

443
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:19,069
Just like normal.
Forget that the camera's
even here.

444
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,873
What do you want me
to talk about?

445
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,777
Talk about Mom.

446
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,886
Talk about Nicole.

447
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,997
What is it?
Uh, there's someone here.

448
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:51,735
I didn't have an appointment.
It's not a good time.

449
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,738
I think you should
come out here, Kevin.

450
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,315
- Hi.
- Um, my name is
Denise Gilcrest,

451
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:09,653
and this is my--
this is Mike Haley.

452
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,622
What--
What can I do for you?

453
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,459
Well--

454
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,195
- Adrienne.
- She's my sister.

455
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:21,164
- You're Kevin Wolfe, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,134
- I took these pictures.
- Have you seen her?

457
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:29,439
Uh, no.
I mean, not for a while.
You know.

458
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,941
Why? Is-- Is she--

459
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:33,910
- She's been missing.
- Missing?

460
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:37,447
- Did you know her?
- Me? No.

461
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:40,517
No, I just saw her
when we did the pictures.

462
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,154
But you knew her
better than that,
didn't you, Kevin?

463
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:48,525
Yeah. I mean,
we went out one night, um,
and then that was it.

464
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,095
I mean, I called her once
after that, and then we saw
each other briefly, but--

465
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:56,900
- Do you remember
what day that was?
- Yeah, that was on--

466
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,736
Uh, when was that?


467
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:04,474
Uh, no, actually I don't
remember exactly.

468
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,776
Well, where did you go?

469
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:09,479
We went to a diner
on 43rd Street,
and then, uh--

470
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,381
Yeah, are you sure
she didn't just take off?

471
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,683
Is that-- I mean,
you called her friends
and everything?

472
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:17,521
If she just took off,
she did it with none
of her belongings--

473
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,122
no suitcase,
no money, nothing.

474
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,758
The detectives think
it's really unlikely, so--

475
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,161
She would have
called her sister,
don't you think?

476
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:28,432
Are the police, like--
Are they helping you guys?

477
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,099
Hardly.

478
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:33,537
So, can you tell us
what you talked about
the last time you saw her?

479
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:38,575
Um, yeah.
Well, I gave her these
pictures, and then, uh--

480
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,344
and then, geez, what did we--
then we talked about, um--

481
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:45,682
Well, we talked about
why she didn't really
wanna see me.

482
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,717
She was breaking up
with you?

483
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,756
Ye-- Well, I mean,
we had hardly left it
at that.

484
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,795
Do you guys
want coffee or--

485
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,332
Hmm.

486
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,433
Oh!

487
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,136
You are one sick
motherfucker.

488
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:09,840
Ah, you're just as interested
in these pictures as I am.

489
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,608
Mm-mmm.

490
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,243
No, I like real girls.

491
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah, but even these girls
won't do it...

492
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:20,350
unless there's a camera there.

493
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,084
It's true.

494
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:26,156
The camera--
That's what makes
all this magic happen.

495
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:30,327
You do have a point.
Which is exactly why
you became a photographer.

496
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:34,531
So that you could get girls
to do twisted shit...

497
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,634
like... that.

498
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:41,371
I don't take pictures
like this.

499
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,307
What about that one?

500
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,577
- It's not pornographic.
- She's naked.

501
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,147
Yeah, but it's different.
It's completely different.

502
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,850
Oh, yeah. I mean,
if I were you, I would--

503
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:59,122
I'm not really interested
in what their bodies look
like in these pictures.

504
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,259
Would Adrienne do
something like--

505
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,895
that?

506
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,831
No.

507
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,535
See her eyes?

508
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:16,139
Yeah?
Yeah, like,
the way they're flat.

509
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,875
Looks like
she doesn't even care,

510
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,977
like it doesn't
even matter.
Yeah.

511
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,546
That's exactly
what I don't like.

512
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,048
When I have a girl
at the studio,

513
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,950
she's, like--

514
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,718
She's doing it for
a whole different reason.

515
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,156
She's looking at the camera
in a completely different way,
like--

516
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:36,826
like she's looking out
at you from the inside.

517
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,629
And you see it.

518
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,732
You see that spark.

519
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,235
You see that life.

520
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,041
Good.

521
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,476
Good. This is really good.
Have you modeled before?

522
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,478
No. I'm an actress.


523
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,647
I mean, I want
to be an actress.

524
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,650
Right.
Wolfe Photography.
Hello.

525
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,653
Uh, Kevin's busy
right now.
Who is it?

526
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,189
Just some girl.
What girl?

527
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:08,658
Uh, Beth,
her name is.

528
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,727
Beth.
Give me the phone.

529
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,129
Hold on. Kevin wants
to talk to you.

530
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:16,466
Hold on for one second.
Beth?

531
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,769
Hi!
Beth from the play, right.

532
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,840
Kevin won
a, uh, portrait award
in college.

533
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:28,011
I don't know
if you know that.
It's true.

534
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,846
I'm Jamie, by the way.

535
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:30,880
I've been doing
Kevin's makeup--

536
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,351
Well, not Kevin's makeup
because Kevin doesn't actually
wear any makeup,

537
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:36,086
but makeup for his clients,
you know.

538
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:39,222
Girls like you--
actresses and models.

539
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,524
You're not a model,
are you?
Mm-mmm.

540
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,592
No. Hmm.

541
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,160
Good. I'm so glad
that you called.

542
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:47,731
<i>Your pitch
was pretty hard to forget.</i>

543
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:51,001
Remember Beth? Hmm?

544
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,969
Those big, watery eyes.

545
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:56,740
Her mouth permanently curved
into a half smile.

546
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:01,578
I'll never forget the day that
she looked me dead in the eye
and she said--

547
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
Okay.

548
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,248
You will?

549
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,284
What do you wanna see?

550
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,653
Um, I don't know.
Whatever.

551
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,856
Anything
that you wanna see.
You can pick it.

552
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,725
Okay. I'll call you.

553
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:20,630
Later this afternoon,
I'll find something
and I'll call you.

554
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,200
Good.
Okay, yeah, call me.

555
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,237

Good.

556
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:27,804
Okay.

557
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,541
I was starting
to get giddy inside.

558
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,711
Like all of a sudden,
I had another chance.

559
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:38,181
It was like Adrienne
had never happened.
Forget Adrienne!

560
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,449

Just relax.

561
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:43,586
I knew exactly what
was gonna happen next.

562
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,889
It was gonna be awesome.

563
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:50,894
Truly, incredibly,
amazingly fantastic.

564
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:56,232
Easily the greatest
romantic experience
of my entire...

565
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:57,033
fucking... life.

566
00:38:57,035 --> 00:39:00,203
You're incredibly blotchy.
What are you talking about?

567
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:04,407
Step away with that thing,
please. Please.

568
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,781
Maybe afterwards
we could grab a bite to eat?

569
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,718
Maybe.

570
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,222
Maybe.

571
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,105
- There's nothing wrong
with me, is there?
- No.

572
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,639
He could-- He could--

573
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,575
I mean, if I really
made an effort--

574
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,844
You would totally
have to help me, Derek.

575
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:44,247
Jamie.
He could go for me,
right?

576
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:47,450
Jamie.
He's all I ever
think about, Derek.

577
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:50,887
I know.
He's all I ever have
on my mind.

578
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:56,126
And sometimes I think
if I could just get him away
from those girls for one minute,

579
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:58,895
if I could just get them out
of the fucking picture--

580
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,230
There's always
another one.

581
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,866
Maybe you should keep
your options open.

582
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:04,834
There are a lot of boys
out there.

583
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:08,004
Kevin can't be
the only one, can he?

584
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,540
He kind of is.

585
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,014
What was she like, Ruby?

586
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,318
What was her--
her personality like?

587
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,423
Oh.

588
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,259
She was full of energy.

589
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,828
She was rambunctious.

590
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,897
Not like you.
You were always quiet,

591
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:36,633
always such
a quiet little boy.

592
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,204
You were very sensitive,
you know.

593
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,707
Oh, but I was
so proud of you.

594
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,176
So proud.

595
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:48,645
Of both of you.

596
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,015
You were
such good children.

597
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,517
A boy and a girl.

598
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,289
Wish your mother
could have seen you.

599
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:03,293
She never even saw
your sister at all,
did she?

600
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,196
She never even saw
what Nicole looked like.

601
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:10,633
She never--
She never got to see
her own daughter.

602
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:18,074
How could I have lost
my two girls like that?

603
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:37,260
Hey, hey.
Hey.

604
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,462
Thought I
wouldn't make it?

605
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:41,297
Hmm. I wasn't sure.

606
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:46,836
Uh, we don't have to
see this particular movie
if you don't want to.

607
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,404
I mean, there are
a lot we can go to.

608
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:52,542
Yeah, this is fine.
I really wanted to see this,
you know, so--

609
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,712
And besides, I already
bought the tickets.

610
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:56,846
Yeah.

611
00:41:56,848 --> 00:42:01,117
Um, do you want
some popcorn?
Sure.

612
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:49,732
 La-la-la-la, la-la

613
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,267
 La-la

614
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:54,504
 La-la-la-la

615
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,646
What about--

616
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:09,619
What about the day
that she-- you know--

617
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,555
in the pool?

618
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:16,793
Kevin. I can't.

619
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,797
You can't remember?

620
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,034
It was my fault.

621
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,737
I wasn't there.
I wasn't--

622
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,873
I know you tried.

623
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,111
Did you see me?

624
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,981
Did you see me try?

625
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:44,921
You know what I like to do
sometimes, Derek?

626
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:52,395
Sometimes I like to imagine
that I have this whole bottle
of little blue pills.

627
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:55,131
Why blue?

628
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:59,569
I don't know.
I just like the color, I guess.

629
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,072
And then, I take
these little blue pills...

630
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:08,678
and I line them up
on the bed, one by one.

631
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,079
Jamie, why are you
telling me this?

632
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:14,250
<i>I'm just making
conversation, Derek.</i>

633
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:19,088
Then I take the pills--


634
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,925
and I push them
into my mouth.

635
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,861
Past my lips.

636
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,799
But you don't have
any... of those pills.

637
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,734
<i>Do you?</i>

638
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,202
No.


639
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:37,874
<i>No, of course not.
'Cause if you did,
you would tell me.</i>

640
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:42,478
I tell you everything, Derek.
You're my sponsor.

641
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,352

I just feel like,
why did she have to call him?

642
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:51,220
<i>Who, Jamie?</i>

643
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:55,725
Her name is--

B-E-T-H.

644
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:59,529
Jamie, I'm--
I'm gonna ask you to
do something for me.

645
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:02,799
I'm gonna put down the phone.

646
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:05,768
And I want you
to look at yourself.

647
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,439
This is gonna sound stupid,
but I want you to look
at yourself in the mirror,

648
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:14,243
and I want you
to tell yourself
that you're pretty.

649
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:22,151
- Did you hear me?
- Are you serious?

650
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,220
<i>Do that for me, Jamie.</i>

651
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:27,557
Are-- Are you gonna stay
on the phone?

652
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,759
<i>I'm right here.</i>

653
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,562
Okay.

654
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,907
You... are--

655
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:50,613

You... are--

656
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:55,451
Fuck you.

657
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,953
Go fuck yourself!

658
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:58,688
I'm not even fucking
kidding around right now.

659
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,925
Go fuck yourself,
you stupid piece of shit!

660
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,293
I fucking hate you!

661
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:09,866
I fucking hate you,
and I want you to fucking die!

662
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:23,646
 The holy crosses

663
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,917
Shit.

664
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,753
Co-- Coming.

665
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,729
Did you find her?

666
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,864
No.

667
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,700
Did you ask anyone
in the diner?

668
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:48,571
Nobody remembers
you two being there.

669
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,308
Where's your boyfriend?
Kevin.

670
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,179
Do you mind if I
ask you a question?

671
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,748
No, not at all.

672
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,185
Did you do something to her?

673
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:04,387
Listen, I-I--

674
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:09,358
I am really sorry
if something bad has happened
to your sister. I really am.

675
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:14,030
<i>But it was her decision to not
see me anymore, you know?</i>

676
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:16,566
That was her choice,
not mine.

677
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:20,169
I've just been trying
to forget I ever met her.

678
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,139
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

679
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:27,076
I don't know what I'm doing.
Just tell me--
Tell me how to help.

680
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,712
I just don't know
where she is.

681
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:32,882
I know. Gee.

682
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:37,587

I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, no. It's okay.

683
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:40,323
It's okay.

684
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,121
That was good.
The movie?

685
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,656
Oh, no, the--
the pizza.

686
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:19,061
Was it, uh,
Ray's Original
or Famous Ray's?

687
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:23,099
Famous Ray's Original.


688
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,742
Um, you can kiss me now.

689
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:38,614
Really?

690
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,587
Hey, hey.

691
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:22,625
Sorry. Not, uh--
Not yet.
What?

692
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,731

Um--

693
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:47,717
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin,
come on. I said stop.


694
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,319
Shit.
Okay.

695
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,421
Sorry.

696
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,026
I just, uh--

697
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,865
Sorry.
I thought that we had a--


698
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:04,700
Oh.
Sorry.

699
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:09,271
No. You're really nice,
you know. Uh--

700
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:13,943
Nice.
And I really like you.


701
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:16,178
And... I just--

702
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,617
I just barely know you.
You know? I mean, we just, um--

703
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,252
I just met you.
And I--

704
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:28,991
I just think, you know,
I gotta wait a little.

705
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:32,495
I mean, you've just
gotta be patient.

706
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,867
But I love you.

707
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,407
Suddenly, I could see
directly into the future.

708
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,042
Sorry.

709
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:51,580
I could see the days
unfolding in front of me
like pages of a newspaper.

710
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:53,849
Huh.
What do you mean?

711
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:58,587
And I realized that Beth
was far, far away.

712
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:02,958
I would have to forget Beth
with some... severity.

713
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,094
It wouldn't be easy.

714
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:12,234
Forgetting Beth
would not be easy at all.


715
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:16,605
If I told her the truth--
This is bullshit.
I'm sorry. This--

716
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,443
If I told her who I really was--

717
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,211
I probably should go.

718
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,847
she would hate me.

719
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:27,917
Uh, Kev. Uh--

720
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:32,688
Why would she go out with me
in the first place?
What the fuck is wrong with her?

721
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,524
Kevin--

722
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:39,228
<i>What the fuck is wrong with me?</i>

723
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,431
I just--

724
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:47,770

And I guess I hadn't really
forgotten Adrienne after all.

725
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,624
Sometimes nothing
can help you forget a girl
better than another one.

726
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:12,561
Hello?

727
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,364
Hey, it's me.
What are you doing?

728
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:19,268
<i>What happened to your date?
What date?</i>

729
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,536
Oh.

730
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,272
Uh, are you hungry?

731
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,007
No.

732
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:29,845
- Will you meet me?
- Okay.

733
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:34,950
The truth is,
women are objects.

734
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,254
I mean, the feminists
can say what they want,

735
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,856
but when it comes
right down to it,

736
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:43,726
girls are made of bones...

737
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:47,429
and muscle...
and blood.

738
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:49,064
And you're over there.

739
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:54,937
You're right behind the camera,
looking at them,

740
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:59,441
creating a moment,
an object in space.

741
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:00,776
- And you're saying--
- Smile.

742
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:04,480
Look this way.
And smooth your hair just back
a little off your eye.

743
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:08,551
<i>- 
And they're saying--
- How do you want me?</i>

744
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,954
Here?
Like this?

745
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:15,958
And you're saying... yes.

746
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,795
Yes, I want you exactly...

747
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,897
like...

748
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,433
that.

749
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,639
Like that.

750
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,875
 I take the "A" train

751
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:44,280
No! 


752
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:46,615
Oh, yes!

753
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,519
- That's one of the saddest
things I've ever seen.

754
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,122
- I'm fine.
And--

755
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,924
- Oh!
- Yes! I got one.

756
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:56,759
Notice the form.

757
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,961

You're like--
I'm a champion!

758
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,897
- Go, Kevin, go!

759
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,367
Your aim--
It almost looks like you're
placing it in the gutter.

760
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,203
There.
You want a direct line.

761
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:12,241
 Cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it 

762
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:15,411
 Feel the hot dough

763
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:16,712
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

764
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:19,014
Are you kidding me?
Oh!

765
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,050
Oh, my God.
I'm like a bowling genius.

766
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:23,085
- That is-- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

767
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:24,086
That-- Wow.


768
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:28,023

Is this helping you?

769
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,326
What do you mean?

770
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,162
With that girl.
With Beth.

771
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:37,800
Is this helping you with
your forgetting thing?

772
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:48,310
Do you know what I need?
What?

773
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,513
I need whiskey.

774
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,083
Neat.

775
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,220
Do you want to go get a drink?

776
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:00,389
Yeah.

777
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,491
That would be fantastic.

778
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:04,493
Okay.

779
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,060
Looks like you caught me.


780
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:42,564
Mmm. Looks like I did.

781
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:02,184
My parents are dead.

782
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,689
Or actually, you know, that I--
I never actually met my dad,

783
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:09,925
so... who knows?

784
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,095
Who knows?
He might still be alive.

785
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:19,168
Um-- And then
when I was eight
or... seven.

786
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,937
Uh-- Something like that--
Eight, seven.

787
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:28,043
I... had a sister.
Uh, Nicole.

788
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:33,148
I have a dead sister...
named Nicole.

789
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,951
What-What happened to her?

790
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,253
You know, I don't know.

791
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:41,790
I, uh-- It's hard
for me to remember.

792
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,959
I, uh--

793
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,562
She drowned in the pool.

794
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,697
She drowned?
Yeah.

795
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:51,400
- Oh, my God.


796
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,905
It's okay, Kevin.

797
00:57:56,907 --> 00:58:00,042
Is it?
Yeah.

798
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,778
It's fine.

799
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,048
I don't pay you enough.
Oh, my God.

800
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,416
Jamie, I don't.
Come on.

801
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:10,385
I don't.
I mean, here we are,
we're sitting here.

802
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:13,222
I feel like I can
tell you anything.

803
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:15,791
You can.
Yeah.

804
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:17,559
I feel like I can--

805
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:22,297
I-I can explain myself
to you.
You can.

806
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:24,867
I feel like--

807
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,835
I feel like
you understand.

808
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:28,937
I do, Kevin.
Yeah.

809
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:32,875
I do.
I-I do understand.

810
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:36,278
I understand
absolutely everything.

811
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,582
Anything that you
could ever say to me,
I would understand.

812
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:44,520
And there's something that I've
been wanting to tell you too.

813
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:46,788
For a really long time, okay?
Mm-hmm.

814
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:51,193
And that is that...
I told my mom...

815
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:55,030
that you were my boyfriend.


816
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,599
And, like, I know
that I shouldn't have.

817
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,168
Oh, and another thing:
I've been following you.

818
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,171
When you're with those girls.
Just to make sure you're okay.

819
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,874
And I know that I shouldn't
and everything, but I just--

820
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,509
I don't know. I wanted
to make sure you were okay.

821
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:11,280
And I just felt, like,
a little bit jealous,
and, uh-- I don't know.

822
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:17,185
It's just that I've always felt
like we have this amazing
connection, you know?

823
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:18,887
And, like, the first time
I ever met you--

824
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,990
It was like
I was watching again.

825
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:26,128
I mean, I was there
with Jamie, in the bar,

826
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,096
sitting on the hard stool.

827
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:33,869
But my true self
was actually up in the ceiling,

828
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:38,707
looking down,
watching myself sitting there.

829
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,810
I could see Jamie too.

830
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:58,427
 I left you on the bed

831
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:02,831
 And took all the money

832
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:16,011
 Gonna buy you something
to ease the hurt 

833
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:19,948
You're here.

834
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,251
You're here.
I am.

835
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,555
I've loved you for so long.

836
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,158
I know.

837
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,397
I've always loved you.


838
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,733
I know.

839
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:40,102
It's okay.

840
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,338
Okay.

841
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:48,143
This is Jean. Jean.

842
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:52,280
Forgotten after
a full-release body massage.

843
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,917
Oh, this is Fiona.

844
01:00:55,919 --> 01:01:01,490
Uh-- I forgot Fiona by joining
a gym I never ended up going to.

845
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:07,729
Brenda. I forgot Brenda
at the Museum of Modern Art.

846
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,566
I forgot... Mary.

847
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,301
Forgot Sarah.

848
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:16,004
Forgot Kelly.

849
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,873
I forgot--

850
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,376
Forgot.

851
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,512
Forgot.

852
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,714
Forgot.

853
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,413
Holy shit.

854
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:15,130

I had to do something radical,

855
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,734
something to forget all this
in a major way.

856
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:20,836
I was really going
out of my mind, I admit.

857
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:23,905
And I don't think I knew--
I mean, I--

858
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,742
I knew what was going on,
what was happening.

859
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:30,812
But I had to find some way
of canceling it all out.

860
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:34,883
Of forgetting Beth,
forgetting Adrienne...

861
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:39,187
and especially
forgetting Jamie.

862
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,197
I had to forget Jamie.

863
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,635
Kevie. Kevie!

864
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:28,603
Kevin!

865
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:31,773
I really feel that we
made this-- this connection.

866
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:34,342
I'm really sorry, Kevin.
But I love you.

867
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:36,044
What do you mean?

868
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:38,113
I feel like
I can tell you anything.

869
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:42,384
I've been following
you. I've always loved you.

870
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,129
Beth.

871
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,631
- What are you doing here?
Oh.

872
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,335
I thought you were someone else.
Ow.

873
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,173
Poor Beth.

874
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,977
She couldn't have known
what I was doing this for.

875
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:12,013
But once I started,

876
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,917
I had to keep going.

877
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,364
Come on.


878
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,500
I had to forget about
all this somehow.

879
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,871
Kevie. Kevie!

880
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:39,441
<i>I just wish I could remember
more about Nicole, you know?
Kevie!</i>

881
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:42,878
What the hell was she doing
in that pool anyway?
She wasn't allowed.

882
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,249
She was too little to swim.
I mean, I could barely
swim myself.

883
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,722
What was I supposed to do?

884
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,791
How was I supposed to save her?

885
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,918
What are we gonna do
with her?

886
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,423
How did you get in?

887
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,161
I finally got a key made.

888
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,832
Oh.

889
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:45,473
Why don't you go
hop in the shower,
and I'll clean up here.

890
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,380
Go.

891
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:18,807
 In the past
I was a man 

892
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:26,047
 But now I'm a ghost
with dirty hands 

893
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:31,486
 I stain the ground
as I crawl to you 

894
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,326
 I stain the ground
as I move on through 

895
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,695
Good.


896
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:44,766
Good. And tilt--
Tilt your head a little
to the left. A little more.

897
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:45,934
Yeah. Completely.

898
01:06:45,936 --> 01:06:48,903
 In the dark I cannot sleep

899
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:52,507
Good. That's good.

900
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:58,513
<i>-  I can't escape
these thoughts that creep 
- Hmm. </i>

901
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,419
Good. Look this way.

902
01:07:04,421 --> 01:07:06,688
Great.
Yeah, let's see that smile.

903
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:09,424
Good. Good.

904
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:11,126
Perfect.

905
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,796
Move your hair.


906
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:24,005
 A shadow descending
to be a man 

907
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,080
Why don't you sit up here?

908
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,148
Me?

909
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:35,950
- Just for one shot.
- 

910
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:37,852
Mmm.
My makeup is a mess.

911
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:40,088
No, that's okay.
It's not a glamour shot,
Jamie.

912
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:44,893
Plus, I just--
I don't have any pictures
of you, that's all.

913
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,103
Let's see.

914
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:14,322
- You know, Jamie,
I've been thinking about--
- I'm not gonna tell anyone.

915
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,157
I know.

916
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:19,661
I know that you
wouldn't do that. But--

917
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,198
You have to understand, I--

918
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,669
I can't go around
remembering all of this.

919
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,807
You know?
I have to forget.

920
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:37,045
Well-Well,
what about last night?

921
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:39,614
Do you have to forget--

922
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,362

Jamie,

923
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:56,865
last night was...

924
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,335
a mistake.

925
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:04,739
Oh.

926
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:07,342
Do you know what I mean?

927
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:20,155
It's okay.

928
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,357
It's okay.

929
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,593
It's okay.

930
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:30,465
'Cause I--
I have been thinking
about something...

931
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,902
for a really long time.

932
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:36,838
And I even told Derek
about it.

933
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,175
And he's trying
to talk me out of it, but...

934
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:46,147
I've got a whole--
whole fucking bottle.

935
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:49,350

Of what?

936
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:51,819
Blue pills.

937
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,956
Blue.

938
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:57,525
Blue.

939
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:03,031
Jamie,
it's gonna be beautiful.

940
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,833
It's gonna be
so beautiful.

941
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,969
You.
Beautiful?

942
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:09,070
You...

943
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:12,807
are gonna be so beautiful.

944
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:15,610
Beautiful.
So beautiful.

945
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,582
So beautiful.
I promise.


946
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:23,418
I promise.

947
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,655
I'll give you something.


948
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:34,295
I wanna be beautiful
for you, Kevin.

949
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,399
I wanna be beautiful
for you.

950
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:50,078
Kevin, if you are watching this,

951
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,615
that means that you found me.

952
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:57,151
And I just want you to know...

953
01:10:57,153 --> 01:11:01,789
<i>why I killed Beth Dalewell
in your studio.</i>

954
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,092
<i>
And also,</i>

955
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:09,564
<i>why I took Adrienne
Gilcrest's life too.</i>

956
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:13,868
<i>I guess I was jealous.</i>

957
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:19,340
And now I have nothing left--


958
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:21,276
<i>to live for.</i>

959
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:24,779
<i>I have nothing left.</i>

960
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,148
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

961
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,387
This is Adrienne.

962
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,556
I forgot her on a camping trip.

963
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,496
This is Beth.

964
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:43,364
Forgotten.

965
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:48,036
And this is Jamie.

966
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,354
Where did you
get these anyway?

967
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,790
A doctor.

968
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,591
Said I was nervous.

969
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:16,297
You should wipe your
fingerprints off the bottle,
don't you think?

970
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:18,266
Don't worry.

971
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:24,339

What if it doesn't work?

972
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,742
It'll work.


973
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,762
Kevin.


974
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:51,065
Can I keep my clothes on?

975
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:55,536
Sure. Sure,
you can keep 'em on.

976
01:16:17,774 --> 01:16:23,010
If you're watching this,
you've discovered something
you shouldn't have.

977
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,720
Anyway, um--

978
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:37,592
This-- This is a close-up
of a model's eye.

979
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:43,064
I can't remember her name
to save my life, but she had
the bluest eyes I'd ever seen.

980
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:48,469
The only other time
I remember seeing this
exact intensity of blue...

981
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:51,572
was the day my sister drowned.

982
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,208
It was everywhere--

983
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:59,880
in the water, in the sky,
Nicole's skin.

984
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:00,948
Blue.

985
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:09,557
Nicole. She's the one girl
I keep trying to remember.

986
01:17:09,559 --> 01:17:13,027
But I-- I think
she's the problem.

987
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:16,931
I think--
I think she's the reason...

988
01:17:16,933 --> 01:17:20,768
I am the way I am, right?

989
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:33,481
This is what it looked like,
these flashes of white.

990
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:36,450
It was like
this empty slide.

991
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:41,088
The sun was flashing
off the water.

992
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,658
It was just like this.

993
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,198
Jesus.

994
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,605
I watched her.

995
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,144
I watched the whole thing.

996
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,150
Through the blue and the gold
and the white flashes.

997
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,554
The white...

998
01:18:13,556 --> 01:18:15,256
flashes.

999
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:16,724
- Flashes.


1000
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,632
Kevie!

1001
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:27,768
Kevin!

1002
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:37,812
Kevin!

1003
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:42,083
Help me! Somebody help!

1004
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:45,219
Do you remember
what happened, sweetheart?

1005
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,788
I just don't remember.

1006
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:56,330
I watched her.

1007
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:01,368
I was looking through the light.

1008
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,672
Into the heart of the light.

1009
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,341
Into the silence.

1010
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:14,081
I knew my baby sister
was drowning.

1011
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:17,852
And I let it happen.

1012
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,426
I watched it...

1013
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,196
because it was beautiful.

1014
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,168
I let it happen...

1015
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:38,639
because it was
beautiful to see.

1016
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:02,196
Under the water,
Nicole called my name.

1017
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,900
What I saw
were flashes of light.

1018
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,170
And what I heard--

1019
01:20:09,771 --> 01:20:12,606
What did I hear?

1020
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:17,077
Put your hands
over your ears.

1021
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:20,848
Press down.

1022
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:26,413
 I know it's hard to tell
how mixed up you feel 

1023
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:31,585
 Hoping what you need
is behind every door 

1024
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:36,690
 Each time you get hurt,
I don't want you to change 

1025
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:41,829
 'Cause everyone has hopes
You're human after all 

1026
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:47,668
 The feeling sometimes,
wishing you were
someone else 

1027
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:52,606
 Feeling as though
you never belong 

1028
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:58,045
 This feeling is not sadness
This feeling is not joy 

1029
01:21:58,047 --> 01:22:04,885
 I truly understand
Please don't cry now 

1030
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:11,292
 Please don't go
I want you to stay 

1031
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:16,297
 I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here 

1032
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:21,835
 I don't want you to hate
for all the hurt
that you feel 

1033
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:28,542
 The world is just illusion
trying to change you 

1034
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:35,549
 Being like you are
Well, this is something else 

1035
01:22:35,551 --> 01:22:41,288
 Who would comprehend?
But some that do lay claim 

1036
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:46,093
 Divine purpose
blesses them 

1037
01:22:46,095 --> 01:22:48,996
 Well, that's not
what I believe 

1038
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:51,999
 And it doesn't matter anyway

1039
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:56,837
 A part of your soul
ties you to the next world 

1040
01:22:56,839 --> 01:23:01,842
 Or maybe to the last,
but I'm still not sure 

1041
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:07,314
 But what I do know is
to us the world is different 

1042
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:13,721
 As we are to the world
I guess you would know that 

1043
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:20,494
 Please don't go
I want you to stay 

1044
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:25,599
 I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here 

1045
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:31,171
 I don't want you to hate
for all the hurt
that you feel 

1046
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:36,910
 The world is just illusion
trying to change you 

1047
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:41,749
 Please don't go
I want you to stay 

1048
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:46,954
 I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here 

1049
01:23:46,956 --> 01:23:52,393
 I don't want you to change
for all the hurt
that you feel 

1050
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:59,099
 This world is just illusion
always trying to change you 

1051
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:35,235
 Please don't go
I want you to stay 

1052
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:40,274
 I'm begging you, please
Please don't leave here 

1053
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:45,746
 I don't want you to hate
for all the hurt
that you feel 

1054
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:51,618
 The world is just illusion
trying to change you 

1055
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:56,423
 Please don't go
I want you to stay 

1056
01:24:56,425 --> 01:25:01,662
 I'm begging you, please
Oh, please don't leave here 

1057
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:07,000
 I don't want you to change
for all the hurt
that you feel 

1058
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:14,041
 This world is just illusion
always trying to change you
