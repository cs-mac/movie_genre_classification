1
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,606
Did you knock?

2
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,489
No, I didn't.

3
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,170
But I did think about it.

4
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,526
And why you didn't?

5
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,887
There was nobody to open.

6
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,482
I was in the cellar.

7
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,002
How did you know?

8
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,083
Do you prefer good company
or the nice view?

9
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,087
I've got the free room upstairs,
next to the Fra's Hubert.

10
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,402
This is really nice monk, really nice.

11
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,002
But there's a view on the wall.

12
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,162
Or this room.

13
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,488
Beautiful view on the yard,

14
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,244
but there's nobody to talk to.

15
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,851
Young foregn girl from next door...

16
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,846
never goes out and never talks with anybody.

17
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,446
The Professor can't see nobody now.

18
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,449
The Professor doesn't receive the patients now.

19
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,566
Let's go to my place.

20
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,841
Can I meet the Professor?

21
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,445
No, it's impossible for now.

22
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,926
I'm sorry.

23
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,209
No, please, understand me. Later.

24
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,240
I had doubts,
if you can handle the situation here.

25
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,489
But dr Barredo commended you much.

26
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,483
Why did you leave his clinic?

27
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,688
Dr Barredo retired.

28
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,362
and his successor wasn't really keen on
accepting my methods of work.

29
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,809
We will try to be convinced by you.

30
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,201
But you are not allowed to teach
the depth perception on your own.

31
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,160
This is due to the safety of the patients.

32
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,282
Do you understand me?

33
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,845
Yes, I do.

34
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,809
Can we come closer?

35
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,924
Why would you like to come closer?

36
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,566
To touch you.

37
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,170
Or smell you.

38
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,369
Yes, to smell.

39
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,209
To smell!

40
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,488
We can smell him!

41
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,729
You can smell.

42
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,566
But stay where you are.

43
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,127
From the distance we can only
recognise that you've been smoking.

44
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,409
And what could you say when being closer?

45
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,171
If you smoke cigarettes or rather a pipe?

46
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,444
Is it worth standing up
just to get to know it?

47
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,764
And without standing up
what else can you tell?

48
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,527
Without standing up? From this place?

49
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,802
You can stand up, if you want.

50
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,168
Somebody's walking on the yard.

51
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,049
A man or a woman?

52
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,367
To my mind it's a woman.

53
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,806
Why?

54
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,328
She's wearing high-heels.

55
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,041
A man can also have heels like that.

56
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,850
The cuban heels.

57
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,931
Like in the 60. or 70.
the disco dancers.

58
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,486
Somebody else?

59
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,325
I think it's a woman.

60
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,006
Because woman's steps are stronger.

61
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,447
I would say it's a man.

62
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,764
Sometimes men can have
stronger steps.

63
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,764
It's a woman.

64
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
Yes, it's a woman.

65
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,881
I think so, too.

66
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,326
Because of the shoes?

67
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,966
Is she young or old?

68
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,326
Young.

69
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,409
And what is she doing?

70
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,087
Sweeping the yard.

71
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,008
The young lady smokes shoddy cigarettes
and coughts like a lunger?

72
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,448
Can you imagine her?

73
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,641
She has finished.

74
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,691
She got ashamed.

75
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,965
But we can still hear her heels!

76
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,767
Who will go to see what she's doing?

77
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,842
Me.

78
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,041
Are your hands clean?

79
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,162
Yes.

80
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,322
Go then.

81
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,641
Without my cane?

82
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,764
Why should you use your cane?
You could hurt her ankle with it.

83
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,201
Watch out!

84
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,486
Did you hurt yourself?

85
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,567
Without the finger in the glass...

86
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,641
...I think I won't make it.

87
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,451
Help!

88
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,405
Over?

89
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,010
Yes.

90
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,046
Was it easy or hard?

91
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,567
Hard.

92
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,123
It's hard. It's very hard.

93
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,480
You're shooing the sparrows.

94
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,049
One comes...

95
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,243
This is some kind of strange bird.

96
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,847
I thought it was a sparrow.

97
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,365
Why a sparrow?

98
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,931
Because it's jumping on both legs.

99
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,570
The others walk like people:
left, right...

100
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,688
This one is much too big for a sparrow.

101
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,482
What do you give them?

102
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,891
The seeds.

103
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,169
What kind of seeds?

104
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,922
Sunflower seeds.

105
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,282
Didn't you know
that the birds like them?

106
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,411
She calls the cat.

107
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,088
She gives him some milk.

108
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,287
And now she goes inside.

109
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,287
She went back to the larder.

110
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,520
And the yardman watches the yard.

111
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,442
How do you know he does?

112
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,050
Because he's smoking.
I can smell the cigarette smell.

113
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,605
Maybe he's sitting?

114
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,129
Yes, it's possible.

115
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,003
Something else?

116
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,089
No. No.

117
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,130
You've missed the cat.

118
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,527
He has passed by just in front
of your noses.

119
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,091
Which cat?

120
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,368
How can you hear the cat?

121
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,209
He would have to bump on something.

122
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,010
You can smell it.

123
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,680
Nobody can smell a cat.
You're inventing it.

124
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,090
You all have smelled it.

125
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,762
You've smelled it with the dog's nose.

126
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,922
You've just missed the dog's barking.

127
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,642
He's probably inventing it. Sure, he does!

128
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,206
Really?

129
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,402
So who has drunk the milk?

130
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,002
Wait. Move the cane a bit forward.

131
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,921
No.

132
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,960
Denilson, come and see yourself!

133
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,649
I'm coming...

134
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,681
You're ready?

135
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,766
What do you have for me this time?

136
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,171
Why?

137
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,241
We wanted to try,
if you use the cane when nobody sees you.

138
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,764
How should I know
if nobody sees me?

139
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,246
I'm blind.

140
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,402
So why don't you use the cane?

141
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,443
A blind man doesn't need a cane.

142
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,250
If only he's not lame.

143
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,328
If you had the cane,
you wouldn't have fallen down.

144
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,569
I told you I didn't use the cane.

145
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,725
Some people claim you're lying.

146
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,644
That's why you spread a fly line
to check me?

147
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,926
And if I knocked my teeth out?

148
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,086
So a cane would be useful?

149
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,682
It's useful for hitting in the desk as well...

150
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,365
So maybe you can see?

151
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,007
Watch out, it can break.

152
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,963
It's not your cane...

153
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,247
Nothing is happening.

154
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,167
Nobody's here.

155
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,486
If nobody's here,
who trims the roses?

156
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,728
How do you know
those are roses?

157
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,849
What else can you trim here?

158
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,407
Who would go to find out
what do they trim here?

159
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,721
Me.

160
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,565
Go then.

161
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,842
Be aware of the thorns.

162
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,201
I'm going, too.

163
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,490
Carefully!

164
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,601
I'll go, too.

165
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,209
There's nobody by the roses.

166
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,169
You looked too low.

167
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,481
This man was standing on the ladder.

168
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,682
I pricked myself three times
at least...

169
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,649
Mother Marie!

170
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,282
Yes, sir?

171
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,529
What are you doing down there?

172
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,569
Stop, Antonio...

173
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,444
My God, you're scratched all over.

174
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,050
What are you doing here?

175
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,642
My God, come with me.

176
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,208
Ian, Tom, come closer, please.

177
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,369
Didn't you prick yourself?

178
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,245
Don't cry.

179
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,283
It's alright.

180
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,649
You didn't prick.

181
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,441
What are you doing?

182
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,809
We were tracing the gardener?

183
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,970
It's good he's not here.

184
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,969
You've stomped his roses...

185
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,167
How come? He has to be here!

186
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,491
You need to be blingfolded
to take part in the lesson.

187
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,165
To my office, please.

188
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,083
The outside lessons
need the preparation.

189
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,127
This group requires at least...

190
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,808
... three sighted attendants.

191
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,608
You are not allowed to walk
patients on your own!

192
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,284
Somebody can be hit by the car!

193
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,569
That's right.

194
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,844
But they don't go straight
on the crossroad, do they?

195
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,284
The only thing that can hit them here
is the cat or the dog.

196
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,042
Ambulances drive in here,
as well as the cars with carbon and with the supply.

197
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,968
You are right.

198
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,128
I'll be more careful.

199
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,611
It's not enought thay you'll be more careful!
Look at yourself.

200
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,609
You're stuck in the middle of the room
because you're not able to see even the chair.

201
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,891
Why don't you use the cane?

202
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,005
I do.

203
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,885
Sometimes.

204
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,844
Far too less considering
the condition of your face!

205
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,120
Who should I speak to
in order to take them outside?

206
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,480
To me.

207
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,767
And I will provide the support
respectively to the number of patients.

208
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,681
I'd like to seat with them on the bench
in front of the door tomorrow.

209
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,886
Alright.

210
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,890
Just write the scenario of the lesson, please.

211
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,090
I'm sorry... Good morning...

212
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,601
Why do we all wait here?
Where's this line from?

213
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,046
We are grounded!

214
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,571
What happened?

215
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,329
The doctor didn't receive the scenario
of the lesson.

216
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,401
Have you forgotten?

217
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,605
Where were you supposed to go?

218
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,131
On the yard!

219
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,046
But you know the yard already.

220
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,930
Didn't you want to go somewhere further?

221
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,445
Sure we did!

222
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,489
We want to see new places!

223
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,169
We want to see new places!

224
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,006
Why don't you just crack open the door?

225
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,129
But we can't go out, right?

226
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,643
You don't need to go out,
crack opening the door is enough.

227
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,249
I'm sorry...

228
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,082
Alright, Serrano, go.

229
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,371
Can you come closer?

230
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,604
Tell me what you see.

231
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,202
The birds.

232
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,162
I can hear some kind of the machine...

233
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,567
... but I don't know what it is used for.

234
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,161
Those are cars.

235
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,608
Can you try a little bit more?

236
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,131
Try harder...

237
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,367
I hear something doing: boom, boom...

238
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,806
What?

239
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,082
I can hear something doing: boom, boom...

240
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,843
This is your heart pounding.

241
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,961
And that's all?

242
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,403
The sky is clear,
but the clouds are coming.

243
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,484
There's going to be a storm.

244
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,891
This is a jet plane.

245
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,486
Are you blindfolded?

246
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,481
No, then I wouldn't be able
to take care of you, right?

247
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,927
So you are not allowed to speak!

248
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,165
And you, Eva?

249
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,966
Me?

250
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,891
I was just passing by...

251
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,365
I saw something...

252
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,051
... but it was impossible.

253
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,771
What was that?

254
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,801
A ship.

255
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,360
What kind of the ship?

256
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,931
What ship?

257
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,401
A big ship.

258
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,721
What?

259
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,401
A big ship.

260
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,008
The one that sails on the ocean.

261
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,686
Can we go out?

262
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,171
We would hear it better.

263
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,401
No, you can't.

264
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,409
We can't.

265
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,002
I can.

266
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,689
But the door looking out the street
are on the other side.

267
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,611
Where is your cane?

268
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,406
Pardon me?

269
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,087
Where is your cane?

270
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,805
I don't own one.

271
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,448
So you can't join me.

272
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,406
Where is this cane?

273
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,530
I broke it down.

274
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,202
How come?

275
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,361
When I was walking around with a cane
everybody was staring at me...

276
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,125
They offered help...

277
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,210
... they pushed and pulled me.

278
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,847
So you broke it down on purpose?

279
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,928
You are able to walk without one...

280
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,486
Can I do that as well?

281
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,811
It's dangerous.

282
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,401
I'll think about that.

283
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,322
I want to try it now!

284
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,641
Please!

285
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,482
And zou tell me
what I'm doing and when I shoudl turn back,

286
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,210
as if you were walking yourself.

287
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,645
You're walking.

288
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,609
You're walking on the pavement.

289
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,085
lam

290
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,285
How are you walking, moron?!

291
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,446
Come back!

292
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,046
Didn't you notice when the pavement
finished?

293
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,442
It was you who didn't notice!
You could have been run over!

294
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,204
I do hear when tha pavement finishes.

295
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,250
And haven't you heard
that the car was coming?

296
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,247
I have.

297
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,808
It was you who haven't heard
since you told me to be back right over the car.

298
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,611
How can you hear the end of the pavement?

299
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,365
Follow me.

300
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,288
Carefully, the step.

301
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,730
The end of the pavement is always hearable.

302
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,921
It is between the steps and the noise of the wheels.

303
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,688
From here you can hear it
with the two-step accuracy.

304
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,765
But when you come closer,
you can track it more precisely.

305
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,446
Imagine it. Then you will hear it.

306
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,091
Listen how it gets closer!

307
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,364
Three steps. Two.

308
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,321
The last step before kerb
always sounds differently.

309
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,362
Try it.

310
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,640
Some more steps..?

311
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,682
No!

312
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,409
Ok, do you want to come back
to the doors?

313
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,522
No, I want to go further.

314
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,770
Eva... Don't let people push you.

315
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,211
Follow me.

316
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,449
The passer-bys go round the obstacles
which don't get out of their way.

317
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,731
But you have to keep determined direction.

318
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,211
What was that?

319
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,726
I don't know.

320
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,246
So how could you go round it?

321
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,211
I did the same as the woman in front of us.

322
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,609
Can you hear her steps?

323
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,649
I can hear many steps.

324
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,120
She's got the shoes on real thin leather.

325
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,482
She uses good parfume.

326
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,762
She's doing window-shopping.

327
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,850
Has she turned?

328
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,643
She's gone into the shop.

329
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,283
A man with the newspaper behind us.

330
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,526
Let him go.

331
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,724
He has a pin in his sole,
can you hear that?

332
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,642
Aren't we following him?

333
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,082
I prefer the other one.

334
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,531
Can you smell him?

335
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,082
Weird parfume.

336
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,687
The mix of yesterday's night drinks
and the morning beer.

337
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,445
What kind of the tree is that?

338
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,565
Can you reach the leaves?

339
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,009
What is this fruit?

340
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,609
Try it.

341
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,769
A cherry.

342
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,444
I can't reach it.

343
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,800
Yes, you can.

344
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,044
You just don't know where to look for it.

345
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,368
Those are bad. Too shy.

346
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,045
Shy? How is that?

347
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,489
Not good.

348
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,370
Trash.

349
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,083
What?

350
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,287
Those are alright.
Eight out of ten.

351
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,209
Try those.

352
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,761
Walk once more.

353
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,165
Some more steps.

354
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,325
Those are the best shoes in the whole shop.

355
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,569
The chair.

356
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,603
What is the chair doing here?

357
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,926
I don't know.

358
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,969
People are sitting on those chairs.

359
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,131
And what are they doing?

360
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,367
I don't know.

361
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,287
Let's have a sit. We'll see what happens.

362
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,883
This is the wind from the see.

363
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,210
How do you know?

364
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,885
I can smell it.

365
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,089
They play checkers.

366
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,971
And drink home-made wine out of the mugs.

367
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,961
Good morning.

368
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,886
Americans?

369
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,365
No. An English man.

370
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,288
German,

371
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,610
Put your hand out.

372
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,966
What's your name?

373
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,205
Two coffees for us, Mario.

374
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,851
Of course!

375
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,801
He didn't notice that I was blind?

376
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,964
No. But don't hold your menu upside down.

377
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,242
How do you know they drink home-made vine?

378
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,289
They pour it out of the jar.

379
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,728
I'd like to have that vine, too.

380
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,206
I think I can smell the sea.

381
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,369
Is there a harbour somewhere?

382
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,841
Yes.

383
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,050
Can you hear those engines?

384
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,805
It sounds like motorcycle racing.

385
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,970
But those are the motorboats in the harbour.

386
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,042
How do you recognise it?

387
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,368
They don't stop at the traffic lights.

388
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,727
The pumps press the petrol... and the water.

389
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,169
You can hear cranes.

390
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,809
In front of us is the wharf.

391
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,245
By the wharf there is a big ship.

392
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,767
Mario has forgotten about us. Mario!

393
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,407
I think I'm deaf.

394
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,605
And who has seen today a big ship?

395
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,648
Maybe you've heard the whistle
when the shop had entered the harbour?

396
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,171
And you've forgotten about than.

397
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,681
Or you've woken up.

398
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,491
The same ship that is now in the harbour?

399
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,725
Can you hear it now?

400
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,169
I don't know well the sounds of this district.

401
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,849
But the church bells reverberate from a big surface.

402
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,367
Maybe it's only the wall made of houses?

403
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,325
Mario probably sees less than me. Mario!

404
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,761
You call him.

405
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,889
I've just invited her for the party...

406
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,525
And that's the problem!

407
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,243
Mario!

408
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,842
A beautiful foreigner is waiting!

409
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,887
I'm going to grab this vine myself
I think.

410
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,848
Mario is talking with a girl.

411
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,565
Maybe the portugese boys take

412
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,011
too many orders?

413
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,889
And the coffee becomes cold?

414
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,564
I don't take orders.
But if you want...

415
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,130
Do you want to smell that?

416
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,364
It's strong!

417
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,969
Brandy. Portugese.
The local speciality.

418
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,120
Wait. I haven't pour it yet!

419
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,367
Try it.

420
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,006
No, thank you. I ordered a vine.

421
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,250
Oh no!

422
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,641
Being too careful doesn't help.

423
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,371
Are you listening?

424
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,289
We're starting.

425
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,808
It hasn't brimmed.

426
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,125
Sometimes it's better to act...

427
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,085
... quickly and resolutely.

428
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,083
Let's try once more.

429
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,969
What are you doing here?

430
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,845
What's wrong?

431
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,281
You're not blind!

432
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,728
Why do you think so?

433
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,722
I know how you cross the street.

434
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,922
And how do I cross the street?

435
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,723
You have to see the cars well,

436
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,689
to cross like that.

437
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,202
You are wrong.

438
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,766
You can see...

439
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,049
every car...

440
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,129
...every car on the street...

441
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,200
...makes a horrible noise!

442
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,889
And then it passes by...

443
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,649
you know how far is every car...

444
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,647
and how fast it is.

445
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,124
I don't believe you.

446
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,568
It is your problem, then.

447
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,804
You can prove you are not lying.

448
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,047
How?

449
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,089
You've said you didn't have eyes.

450
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,044
I don't.

451
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,244
So you have fake eyes.

452
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,405
Glass ones, right?

453
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,847
Please.

454
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,004
Touch them yourself.

455
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,161
Should I take them out?

456
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,771
No!

457
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,844
Take them! Please!

458
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,885
I don't want them!

459
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,330
Play with them!

460
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,240
And, what are you doing now?

461
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,249
I'm clicking.

462
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,566
What?

463
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,602
And where is your cane?

464
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,841
I don't have it.

465
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,642
You don't have it?

466
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,167
No.

467
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,720
Do you want to fall down?

468
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,490
Knock your teeth out?

469
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,725
I don't want it. That's why I'm clicking.

470
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,405
Ian, show to the doctor how to click.

471
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,922
The doctor doesn't believe me.

472
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,849
What did he say?

473
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,681
Please, show how to click.

474
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,126
Are you here?

475
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,447
Yes.

476
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,683
Will you click for doctor Pedros?

477
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,121
Sure.

478
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,446
Very well.

479
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,249
Clicking.

480
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,089
Show me how you walk without a cane.

481
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,489
With clicking.

482
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,005
My mouth is dry, it's hard to click...

483
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,810
The exercise is about...

484
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,851
hearing the bicycle
which Jose left on the courtyard.

485
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,200
Can you hear it?

486
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,802
Yes.

487
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,249
And can you hear it?

488
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,450
I can't hear bell.

489
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,087
Doesn't matter.
We want to hear the bike when it's not using the bell.

490
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,880
Even then it gives the sounds back.

491
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,363
Clicking, for example.

492
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,520
You can also snap your fingers or
tap with the shoes, the good shoes.

493
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,166
Can I start?

494
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,242
Yes!

495
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,689
Yes, please, show it.

496
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,005
It has a bell.

497
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,929
Impressive!

498
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,363
Do you use the sensor?

499
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,686
What do you mean?

500
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,330
The sensor which you have in your pocket.

501
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,408
I don't use any sensor!

502
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,090
But you do own an electronic gadget...

503
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,890
I saw it it your hand.

504
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,929
Do you mean this one?

505
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,125
Yes.

506
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,447
Do you use it sometimes?

507
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,085
Almost never.

508
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,528
It's ultrasonic range finder.

509
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,131
Is it useful in finding your way?

510
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,521
But you don't use the cane, right?

511
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,092
No, I don't.

512
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,207
So you use the sensor...

513
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,004
I use many things.
But rarely the sensor.

514
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,169
Can I see?

515
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,365
You click so well
that you don't need the cane.

516
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,525
I click rarely.
What you need are good shoes.

517
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,368
Did you hear the motorbike?

518
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,601
Which motorbike?

519
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,446
There is a motorbike on the courtyard, too.

520
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,565
You should have heard it.
It is close.

521
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,804
It surely reflects clicking.

522
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,761
I haven't heard it. Does it stand near the wall?

523
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,041
Or any other objects?

524
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,207
No.

525
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,521
So it stands too far.

526
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,166
Few more meters do make a difference.

527
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,163
Won't you find it without the sensor?

528
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,284
I've told you I don't use the sensor
to find my way.

529
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,807
Clever thing. It vibretes more
when the distance gets smaller.

530
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,044
Show me you don't need a sensor!

531
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,043
Yes, show them!

532
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,242
Show them!

533
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,128
He fell in carbon's chute!

534
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,131
He should use the cane as every blind person.

535
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,409
You are dangerous.

536
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,205
Dangerous for yourself and the other blind people.

537
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,966
I won't let you work
with my patients anymore.

538
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,210
I need to fire you.

539
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,443
I gave you good references.

540
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,122
And you'll get the whole month salary.

541
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,565
If I can't work with blind people anymore...

542
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,764
...maybe I could get another work
in the clinic?

543
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,204
What do you think of?

544
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,090
I don't know...

545
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,206
... we need the library in Braille.

546
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,601
Some blind children...

547
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,449
...are waiting for every free place here.

548
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,925
I can't sacrifice those places...

549
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,765
I can rent a room in the town
and come to work everyday as all the others.

550
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,844
I won't give you any work

551
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,641
in which you had any contact with the patients.

552
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,287
This is a private clinic.

553
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,087
It can maintain due to charity donations...

554
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,402
because it doesn't pay taxes to the order.

555
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,451
One missed step can destroy...

556
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,327
...the haritage of many years of hard work.

557
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,043
I'll think about an office work for you.

558
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,765
But you are forbidden...

559
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,163
...to walk around the clinic
without a cane.

560
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,561
The sensor is coming!

561
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,250
He was given a cane!

562
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,409
Lier!

563
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,131
Can you walk?

564
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,845
Why are you interested if I can walk?

565
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,764
Would you like to go somewhere?

566
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,690
Maybe in the same place as yesterday?

567
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,331
To this bar?

568
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:11,567
Yes.

569
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,449
I can't.

570
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,731
Did they take the sensor away?

571
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,081
I don't need a sensor!

572
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,209
Why exactly to this bar?

573
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,763
Do you want to be the girl
without a cane?

574
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,967
To be picked up by the guy again?

575
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,560
Which guy?

576
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,524
Mister "Brandy Portugues".

577
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,642
"Local speciality".

578
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,450
I can go.

579
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,649
Where do you want to go?

580
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,844
To this bar on the corner.

581
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,689
I know where it is.

582
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,770
Ready?

583
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:24,889
Yes.

584
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,882
I'm waiting for you!

585
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,648
A minute or an hour more?

586
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,005
What's wrong?

587
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,440
I don't have a cane.

588
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,922
I do.

589
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,009
Pretend you are leading me.

590
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,121
Come, without the cane you'll be
more sexy.,,

591
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,648
...and I don't mind.

592
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,488
Not so fast!

593
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,530
Watch out!

594
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,247
Please, it's too fast!

595
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,090
Everything's alright?

596
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,200
Yes.

597
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,929
Where are the cherries?

598
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,009
Guincho is the dangerous beach.

599
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,731
...the strong wind is there...

600
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,930
Great beach... for surfing.

601
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,008
I'm sorry, it's my surfboard/

602
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,407
This is an action.

603
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,483
There are no cherries here.

604
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,966
Action?

605
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,006
He says it's an action.

606
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,646
Good morning, my beautiful foreigner!

607
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,050
Good morning, my beautiful foreigner!

608
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,011
Good morning, Senhores.

609
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,571
You've made it!

610
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,086
Is it here?

611
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,449
Can't you recognise the smell?

612
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,881
Coffee!

613
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,731
You can have a seat.

614
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,849
Is it the sea breeze?

615
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,365
Yes.

616
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,963
I can't smell the seeweed.

617
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,725
Is it a motorboat?

618
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,009
It sounds like a common motorcycle.

619
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,929
But it can go wherever it wants.

620
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,920
No traffic lights, no police,
no heavy traffic...

621
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,289
...it's not a motorcycle.

622
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,125
Is this ship still here?

623
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,810
You have to wait.

624
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,004
When the church bells ring,
you'll hear an echo.

625
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,331
It's a motorboat!

626
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,251
I'm terribly sorry!

627
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,640
Are you alright?

628
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,081
Did something happen to you?

629
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,408
No, nothing.

630
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,046
The guy almost bite my hand off.

631
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,530
American, right?

632
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,766
From New York.

633
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,362
You?

634
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,885
From Berlin.

635
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,807
Holidays?

636
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,411
Not really...

637
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,640
I've got a week of holidays left...

638
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,127
and I'm just hanging out on the coast...

639
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,280
Are you staying long?

640
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,203
Until it's possible to keep up
on the surfboard.

641
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,528
Do you surf? Really?

642
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,082
A little bit.

643
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,448
Where can you surf here?

644
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,802
Here, in Europe, nowhere, in fact.

645
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,888
Except Guincho.

646
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,284
Is there any club?

647
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,482
I'd need to rent a board.

648
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,967
It won't be easy.

649
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,441
Those are maniacs,
they don't borrow their boards.

650
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,326
Do you really surf?

651
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,242
A little bit.

652
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,367
It's very dangerous place.

653
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,241
Every year the current takes
somebody under the Cabo da Roca.

654
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,765
I'll be careful.

655
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,331
At least I will watch.

656
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,771
Will we meet there after?

657
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,881
Today, in Gincho?

658
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,246
Yes.

659
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,251
I'll get the board.

660
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,207
The wind... The wind is really strong today...

661
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,488
I'm a bit afraid when weather is like that.

662
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,446
We'll keep on the boards somehow.

663
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,726
I don't know...

664
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,328
It's hard for you to keep on the chair...

665
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,960
The bells!

666
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,451
Listen to the bells!

667
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,765
The church bell ring!

668
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,725
There's an echo!

669
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,681
True!

670
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,929
Every single beat can be heard twice!

671
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,280
And what does it mean?

672
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,280
The sound reflects from the ship.

673
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,721
Which ship?

674
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,729
This one here, in the harbour!

675
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,446
What harbour?

676
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,963
Is there any harbour here?

677
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,967
Senhores, how far is to the harbour
from here?

678
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,243
Which harbour?

679
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,402
Alcȃntara?

680
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,449
Yes. How to go there?

681
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,089
It's too far to walk.

682
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,085
Take the tram 28 to Prazeres.

683
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,562
And then the bus to Alcȃntara.

684
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,485
Is there nothing closer?

685
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,602
Santa Apolónia. A bit closer.

686
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,921
Yes! Santa Apolónia.

687
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,405
How to go there?

688
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,684
Take 28 to Martim Moniz Square.

689
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,844
I need something closer.

690
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,846
There is nothinb between
Alcȃntara and Santa Apolónia.

691
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,086
Try it, please.

692
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,486
Very nice!

693
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,131
What's the price?

694
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,806
Give it a try,

695
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,725
Please, try it! It's good!

696
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,089
You're a lier!

697
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,289
You lie to everybody!

698
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,051
Really?

699
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,565
There is no ship!

700
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,048
There is no harbour even!

701
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,491
Who told you that?

702
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,251
The locals from the bar.

703
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,531
Senhores...

704
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,200
They sit in the bar the whole day long...

705
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,885
and watch the street.

706
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,489
But they can't see anything.

707
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,411
How's that?

708
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,525
They watch...

709
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,250
...but they can't see.

710
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,601
In the harbour there is a big ship
and it can be heard clearly.

711
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,009
Senhores can't see it since you can't see
the coast from the bar.

712
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,001
You're lying, because you know
I can't see anything!

713
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,763
You can prove that you're not lying.

714
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,328
No! Give me the cane back!

715
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,205
And how will I walk?

716
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,447
Keep up with me.

717
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,240
Three steps. Two. Now.

718
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,320
Watch the kerb!

719
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,287
Stop.

720
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,804
Before the scooter will the the break.

721
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,967
Do you know how the scooter sounds?

722
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,087
Yes.

723
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,602
Now.

724
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,282
Now.

725
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,846
How do you feel?

726
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,771
Perfect!

727
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,841
Everything's alright?

728
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,087
I think so.

729
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,804
I've lost my glasses.

730
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,009
Where's my cane?

731
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,561
Here.

732
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,642
I'd prefer to have a cane.

733
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,965
This cane is too short.

734
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,326
Too short...

735
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,966
How long should it be?

736
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,362
I don't know.

737
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,282
It should keep you further away
from the danger.

738
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,050
All blind people have canes like this.

739
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,410
And still they have...

740
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,920
...accidents.

741
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,083
We are looking for the ship?

742
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,321
Yes.

743
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,449
But it's not here.

744
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,448
Where are we?

745
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,848
What's in front of us?

746
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,565
Throw a stone.

747
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,489
What kind of water is that?

748
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,209
The Atlantic.

749
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,847
The Tag river is on the left.

750
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,091
Fish...

751
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,971
Once more.

752
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,011
It's here.

753
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,926
Where?

754
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,291
Here.

755
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,326
Can't you hear it?

756
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,208
No.

757
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,204
It starts here.

758
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,325
Clap your hands.

759
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,446
Can you hear the difference?

760
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,007
Yes.

761
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,564
Here is where the ship ends.

762
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,811
How big it is?

763
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,368
Not that big.

764
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,689
About 30 meters.

765
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,489
We're not looking for this one.

766
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,090
This is this ship.

767
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,926
Where?

768
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,004
What can you hear?

769
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,120
A wall.

770
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,566
Very high wall.

771
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,842
It is a huge ship.

772
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,529
I can't hear it's a ship!

773
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,206
Yes, you can.

774
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,042
Imagine it is talking to you.

775
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,490
How can I imagine that
if I can't hear it?

776
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,803
Imagine it first
and then it will talk to you.

777
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,325
And the you will hear it!

778
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,081
And what is he saying?

779
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,845
He says...

780
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,526
...that the sun was heating it the whole day.

781
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,482
And now it can cool down in Tag.

782
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,529
It's warmer up.

783
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,247
But it has cooled a bit down.

784
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,208
How can you know it's not
a building or a canal boat?

785
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,091
It is not a canal boat!

786
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,042
One of the engines is working.

787
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,368
It always goes at low revolutions.

788
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,208
For the passenger to light the lamp

789
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,567
and take the cold beer from the fridge.

790
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,124
You can't hear it...

791
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:48,085
but the whole ship is vibrating
gently.

792
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,447
Really?

793
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,003
Something else?

794
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,766
A razor buzzes up there, on the left.
Golarka brzęczy w górze, po lewej.

795
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,011
Maybe an officer is shaving
before the sentry?

796
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,770
How do you know it's an officer?

797
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,050
I don't know if it's an officer.

798
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,327
Why would the passenger shave
in the middle of the night?

799
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,566
Can you hear his epaulette, too?

800
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,246
And you can't hear nothing?

801
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,721
No!

802
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,090
I'm cold, I'm going back!

803
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,804
Please, take this.

804
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,206
Thank you!

805
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,529
Do you know where are you going?

806
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,806
Wait here!

807
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,720
What were you doing in the harbour?

808
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,841
Three security cameras filmed you
throwing stones.

809
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,769
We were throwing it.
But we weren't pointing anything.

810
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,931
It's hard to point, without eyes.

811
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,401
Why were you throwing them then?

812
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,280
To hear the plop.

813
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,124
Plop means that something has been pointed.

814
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,562
So you wanted to point something!

815
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:27,842
Point what?

816
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,491
An Atlantic.

817
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,880
Serrano! Didn't I stiched you up last week?

818
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:39,601
No.

819
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,368
And who pu the stiches on you arm?

820
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:44,651
Doctor Pedros.

821
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,807
You stiched up my knee.

822
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,968
Here lies the blind man
who used to be my patient.

823
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,651
Such as you.

824
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,401
I'll show you what happened to him.

825
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,246
Wait here.

826
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:37,201
Why?

827
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,210
He was run over the train.

828
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,522
No breaks.

829
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:00,921
Good.

830
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,085
Thank you.

831
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,447
And now, pack your things, please...

832
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,689
... and leave immidiately!

833
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,006
Do you understand?

834
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,201
Yes.

835
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,968
Can I say good-bye to my friends?

836
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,890
I know they liked you.

837
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,045
But would it be better to protect them...

838
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,087
...from the sad partying?

839
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,041
Alright.

840
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,048
Those are the seeds.

841
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:23,725
I'll show you.

842
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,364
And this is your bird.

843
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,361
Thank you.

844
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,204
Do you remember about scrambled eggs?

845
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,407
I do.

846
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,881
Good morning.

847
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,411
Good morning, Mário.

848
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,929
Something to drink?

849
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,401
A bacon in my scrambled eggs?

850
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:54,961
I'm talking to you!

851
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,564
Why is there a bacon in my scrambled eggs?

852
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,491
I'm terribly sorry!

853
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,404
I can't eat bacon!

854
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,765
Can I move a bit your suitcase?

855
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,129
Something to drink?

856
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,971
More coffee?

857
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,926
Brandy?
