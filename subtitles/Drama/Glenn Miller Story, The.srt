1
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,326
I'm talkin'about friendship.

2
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,724
I'm talkin'about character.

3
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:32,039
I'm talkin'about--
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed
to use the word.

4
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,108
I'm talkin' about ethics.

5
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,314
You know I'm a sportin' man.

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,712
I like to lay the occasional bet.

7
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,205
But I ain't that sportin'.

8
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:45,083
When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

9
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,097
to throw a goddamned fight.

10
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:51,029
I figure I got the right
to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

11
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,674
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch
Bernie Bernbaum,

12
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:57,935
before I know it,
the odds is even up.

13
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,525
Or worse, I'm bettin'
on the short money.

14
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,730
The sheeny knows
I like sure things.

15
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:06,087
He's sellin' the information
I fixed the fight.

16
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,485
Out of town money
comes pouring in.

17
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,691
The odds go straight to hell.

18
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:13,951
I don't know who
he's sellin' to-- maybe
the Los Angeles combine.

19
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:15,870
I don't know. The point is,

20
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:19,898
Bernie ain't satisfied
with the honest dollar
he can make off the vig.

21
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:23,063
He ain't satisfied with
the business I do on his book.

22
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:25,940
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

23
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:29,105
And that means part
of the payoff that should
be riding on my hip...

24
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:31,215
is riding on someone else's.

25
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:33,708
So, back we go
to these questions--

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,448
friendship, character,

27
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,846
ethics.

28
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,833
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

29
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,861
As mud.

30
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:56,823
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return
from a fixed fight.

31
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,275
Now, if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

32
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,536
For a good return,you gotta
go bettin'on chance,

33
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,838
and then you're
back with anarchy.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,756
Right back in the jungle.

35
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:12,647
That's why ethics is important--
what separates us
from the animals,

36
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:15,141
the beasts of burden,
the beasts of prey.

37
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:17,155
Ethics.

38
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:21,087
Whereas, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

39
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,731
ethics-wise, as in
he ain't got any.

40
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,759
- You sure it's Bernie
selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

41
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:32,596
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one that ain't got ethics.

42
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:35,473
What about the fighters
you pay to tank out?

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,405
We only pick fighters
we know we can put
the fear of God in.

44
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:41,707
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

45
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:44,776
I-I lay an occasional bet
with Mink Larouie.

46
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,365
- But it ain't Mink.
I'll vouch for that.
-How do you know?

47
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,530
It ain't Mink.
Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

48
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:54,271
Of course the Dane
always knows about the fix.

49
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,477
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

50
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,834
Let it drift. All it means is
a lot of people know.

51
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:02,232
I guess you ain't
been listenin'.

52
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:04,342
Sure, other people know.

53
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,027
That's why we gotta go
to this question of character...

54
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:10,575
to determine just who, exactly,
is chiselin' in on my fix.

55
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:14,316
And that's how we know
that it's Bernie Bernbaum,
the shmatte kid--

56
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:17,289
'cause ethically,
he's kinda shaky.

57
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:22,372
- So you want to kill him.
- For starters.

58
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,594
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

59
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:45,102
Listen, Leo, I ain't
askin' you for permission.

60
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:49,130
I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.
I need to do this thing,
so it's gonna get done.

61
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:51,144
And I'm tellin' you, as
a courtesy, you'll have trouble.

62
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:54,885
You came here to see if
I'd kick if you killed Bernie.
Well, there's your answer.

63
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:58,530
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer

64
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:00,448
a lot more than the shmatte,

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,462
and I'm sick of gettin'
the high hat.

66
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:05,339
You pay off for protection
just like everyone else.

67
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,120
As far as I know, and
what I don't know in this town
ain't worth knowing,

68
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:10,134
the cops haven't closed
any of your dives...

69
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,532
and the D.A. hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

70
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:15,025
You haven't bought any license
to kill bookies,

71
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:17,040
and today I ain't sellin'any.

72
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,917
So take your flunky and dangle.

73
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:24,137
You think I'm some guinea
fresh off the boat,
and you can kick me.

74
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:28,069
But I'm too big for that now.
I'm sick of takin'
the strap from you, Leo.

75
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:30,562
I'm sick of marching
into this goddamn office...

76
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,576
to kiss your Irish ass,

77
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,974
and I'm sick of the high hat!

78
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:54,060
You's fancy pants, all of youse.

79
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,280
Johnny?

80
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:01,541
You're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger,

81
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,747
and don't forget it, ever.

82
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,159
That's right, Leo.

83
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:10,173
You're the big shot
around here,

84
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,721
and I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

85
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,791
Twist a pig's ear,
watch him squeal.

86
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:35,396
- Bad play, Leo.
- Who got up the wrong side, huh?

87
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,272
-Same side as always.
- That's what I mean.
Still owe money to--

88
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:41,629
Who is your bookie, Lazarre?
I could put it right for you.

89
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,602
- Thanks, Leo. I don't need it.
- In a pig's eye.

90
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,616
You haven't played
a winner in six weeks.

91
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,918
People will speak ill of me
if I let him break your legs.

92
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,658
- People will say I had it coming.
-And they'll be right,
but that ain't the point.

93
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:56,399
Call me a bighearted slob,
but I'm gonna square it
for you, yeah.

94
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:59,852
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

95
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:03,592
Lookin' at you mopin' around
takes away all my--

96
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,182
What do you call it?
"Joy de veever"?

97
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,251
-Joie de vivre.
- Well, if you're gonna
laugh at me, the hell with ya.

98
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:11,744
The hell with you.

99
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,238
I'll square myself with Lazarre,
if you don't mind.

100
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,115
That's why God invented cards.

101
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:22,198
- There is one thing
you can do for me.
- Name it.

102
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,596
Think about what
protecting Bernie gets us.

103
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,185
Think about what
offending Caspar loses us.

104
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:29,487
Oh, come on, Tommy.
You know I don't like to think.

105
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,597
Yeah.

106
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,433
Well, think about
whether you should start.

107
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,863
Wake up, Tommy.

108
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,932
- I am awake.
- Your eyes are shut.

109
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,138
Who you gonna believe?

110
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,798
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

111
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:38,483
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,292
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

113
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,649
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

114
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,966
- Who made off with me hat?

115
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,843
Verna. Verna and Mink.

116
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:58,145
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

117
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,831
Is Thunderclap running tonight?

118
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:10,996
Thunderclap?
Yeah.

119
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,106
What's she leaving at?

120
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,600
Three to one, more than likely.

121
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:18,861
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

122
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,354
Tell Lazarre...

123
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,711
I want 500 on the nose.

124
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:27,204
You would have it.

125
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,262
I want me hat.

126
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:45,906
Is that all you came for?

127
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:48,304
Yeah. I want me hat.

128
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,414
It's mine. I won it.

129
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,004
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

130
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,938
I need a drink.

131
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,527
Why didn't you say so?

132
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,592
Hello, Tommy.
Sorry about the hour.

133
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:07,333
- I'll live. What's the rumpus?
-Can I come in?

134
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,320
Sure.

135
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:23,541
- Drink?
- I wouldn't mind.

136
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,172
I tried callin' earlier.

137
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:34,762
I got home late.

138
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:44,928
- Well, uh, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

139
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:00,274
- Not bad.
- Better than the paint
we sell at the club.

140
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,863
That it is. That it is.

141
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:08,426
- You thought about
cutting Bernie loose?
- Can't do it, Tommy.

142
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:11,303
Can't do it.

143
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,797
That's sort of why I'm, uh--

144
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:19,167
Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.

145
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,524
- Uh-huh.
- I know what you're thinkin',
what else is new?

146
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:25,401
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

147
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:28,758
Verna can take care of herself,
maybe better than you can.

148
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:32,307
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

149
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,225
No.

150
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,335
What does that mean?

151
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,636
How far she got
her hooks into you?

152
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,746
That's a hell of a question.

153
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:44,966
It's a grift.

154
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:48,515
If she didn't need you
to protect her brother
from Johnny Caspar,

155
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:52,063
you think she'd still be going
on slow carriage rides with you
through the park?

156
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:56,380
That's the deal, isn't it?
You keep Bernie under wraps
till Caspar cools down?

157
00:12:56,668 --> 00:13:00,216
Jesus, you're a prickly pear.
What's wrong with her wanting
her brother taken care of?

158
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,134
Nothing. I don't blame her.

159
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:04,436
She sees the angle,
which is you, she plays it.

160
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:07,313
She's a grifter,
just like her brother.

161
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,615
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

162
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,588
and someday they're each
gonna spawn little grifter kids.

163
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,753
Stop it, Tommy.
I don't like to hear my friends
run down, even by other friends.

164
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,959
- Friendship's got
nothing to do with it.
- The hell you say.

165
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:20,740
You'd do anything to help
your friends, like you'd do
anything to kick your enemies.

166
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,275
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

167
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,193
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

168
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,166
You know all the angles,
Christ, better than anybody.

169
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,249
But maybe you're wrong
about this. You don't know
what's in Verna's heart.

170
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,030
Leo, if she's such an angel,

171
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,236
why are you looking for her
at 4:00 in the morning?

172
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,374
I put a tail on her this afternoon.

173
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:49,033
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around,

174
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,294
just, you know,
to keep her out of trouble.

175
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:56,322
I was worried.
After that meeting with Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

176
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:59,487
- So what did Rug say that has you
scurrying over here?
- That's just it.

177
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:04,954
- Nothing. He's disappeared.
- So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

178
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,639
I guess it does sound
pretty sorry at that.

179
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:10,996
Help me out, Tom.
I wouldn't know where
to start lookin'.

180
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,586
You know Rug's crowd.
You know the people Verna runs with.

181
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:17,134
It's just I'm worried now
with things the way they are
between me and Caspar.

182
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,915
You shouldn't be confronting
Johnny Caspar. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

183
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:22,697
You can't trade
body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

184
00:14:22,888 --> 00:14:26,629
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

185
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:33,150
Except you, Tom.

186
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:35,164
And Verna.

187
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,153
Okay. Give me the needle.

188
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,949
I am a sap.

189
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,210
I deserve it.

190
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:57,416
Thanks for the drink.

191
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,964
Let me know
if you hear anything.

192
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:31,750
- Who was that?
- Leo.

193
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:33,956
He's lookin' for you.

194
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:36,450
Did you tell him I was here?

195
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,847
No.

196
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,410
Did you put in a good word
for my brother?

197
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,616
No.

198
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:49,781
- You said you would.
- I said I'd think about it.

199
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,906
What did you tell him?

200
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,468
Did you see
Rug Daniels last night?

201
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,866
No.

202
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,880
What did you tell Leo?

203
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,565
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

204
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,086
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

205
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,304
- Hello, Tom.
What's the rumpus?
- Mink.

206
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:27,414
- I see you got your hat back.
- Yeah, what of it?

207
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,428
Not a thing. Look,
if it ain't my business,
I got not a thing to say.

208
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,442
Listen, Bernie wants to see you.
It's important.

209
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,360
Yeah, well, I'm right here.
I'm not made of glass.

210
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,950
He's nervous walkin' around
in public. He's a right guy,
but he's very nervous.

211
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,539
I mean, who wouldn't be?
In the spot he's in,
who wouldn't be?

212
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:40,841
He asked me to ask you
to ask Leo to take care of him.

213
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,855
Leo listens to you.
Not that Leo wouldn't help
a shmatte anyway.

214
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,157
A guy like Bernie?
A straight shooter like him?

215
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,842
- I don't get it, Mink.
- What's to get? It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

216
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,144
- I thought you were
Eddie Dane's sycophant.
- Yeah, Tom, that's right,

217
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,159
but a guy can have more
than one friend, can't he?

218
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:55,132
Not that I want the Dane to know
about it, but the shmatte,
he's a right guy, Tommy.

219
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,722
He's got a mixed reputation,
but for a sheeny, he's got
a lot of good qualities.

220
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:00,886
- What's goin' on
between you and Bernie?
- Nothin', Tom.

221
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,901
We're just...
friends, you know, amigos.

222
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,298
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

223
00:18:05,394 --> 00:18:09,326
If Eddie Dane finds out
that you got another "amigo"--

224
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:12,971
- Well, I don't peg him
for the understanding type.
- Find out?

225
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,656
How's he gonna find out?
Damn it, you and me
ain't even been talkin'!

226
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:18,150
Jesus, Tom! Damn it!Jesus!

227
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,753
Hello, Tommy.

228
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:25,822
- You know O'Doole and the mayor?
-I oughta.

229
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:28,507
Voted for him six times last May.

230
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,522
And that ain't the record, either.

231
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:36,372
Oh, Verna turned up.
She's downstairs.

232
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,729
- She say where she'd been?
- No. I didn't want to press her.

233
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,948
- You hear about Rug?
- Yeah. R.I.P.

234
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,921
They took his hair, Tommy.

235
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,607
Jesus, that's strange.
Why would they do that?

236
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:53,924
- Maybe it was injuns.
- "Eye-ties," more like it.

237
00:18:56,129 --> 00:18:57,952
Giovanni Gasparo.

238
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,733
So you figure Caspar bumped Rug.

239
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:03,322
- Well, it's pretty obvious, ain't it?
- Yeah?

240
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:08,118
- So what's the plan?
- Well, we'll jump on the guinea
hard with both feet.

241
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,570
- Give him the lowdown, Dale.
- Yes. Well, um,

242
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,352
Leo here just reminded us
that Mr. Caspar operates...

243
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:16,366
several clubs in our city,

244
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,202
wherein the patrons
imbibe of rum and play
at games of chance.

245
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,408
And we're supposed to
stop the party.

246
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,285
- They don't look
to happy about it, Leo.
- Oh, no, it ain't that, Tom.

247
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:28,450
-Jesus, Tom, we do as we're told.
- Maybe they're right
not to like it.

248
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:31,423
Stirring up this hornet's nest
won't be good for anyone,
and it'll mean killing.

249
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:34,492
I'm not thrilled
about it either, but I can't
just lay down to Caspar.

250
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:37,081
You could do worse.
You might not like it, but
giving up Bernie Bernbaum...

251
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,096
is a pretty small price
to pay for peace.

252
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,069
Business is business,
and a war is going to hurt everybody.

253
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,370
Bernie plays with fire,
he's got to deal
with the consequences.

254
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,384
even if that means
he gets bumped off.

255
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,221
SweetJesus, Tom, that ain't
even the point anymore.
Caspar pooped Rug.

256
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:53,003
The day I back down
from a fight, Caspar's
welcome to the rackets,

257
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,113
this town and my place
at the table.

258
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,223
- I didn't start this thing, but--
- You did start it.

259
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,484
- You and Verna.
- We can dangle, Leo,
if you'd prefer.

260
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:02,594
Sit down, Dale!
We're all friends here.

261
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,950
And Caspar hasn't
broken the rules, Bernie has,
and you, too, by helping him.

262
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:08,156
And if that isn't enough,
consider that if you
make this a war,

263
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:10,266
you have more to lose than Caspar.

264
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,198
Okay, but more to beat him with.
Jesus, Tom, the two of us
have faced worse odds.

265
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,747
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

266
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,707
Well, it's your call.

267
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,543
My opinion used to count
for something around here.

268
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,653
But it's always yours
to take or leave.

269
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:33,571
Come on, Tommy.
It's not like that.

270
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,983
Goddamn it!

271
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,874
Goddamn kid's just like a twist.

272
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,272
Get me a stiff one.

273
00:20:46,806 --> 00:20:48,916
No small talk, huh?

274
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:54,192
- They shoot your horse?
- If there's any justice.

275
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:57,837
- Verna around?
- She stepped into
the ladies' room.

276
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,097
- You got Lazarre's 500?
- You'll have to carry me
for a few days.

277
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,070
He ain't gonna like that.
Couldn't you get it from Leo?

278
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,331
It's not Leo's debt.
I'll pay me own way.

279
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:09,345
I admire a man of principle.

280
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,757
Does this go on the tab?

281
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,442
-
- Close your eyes, ladies.
I'm coming through.

282
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:23,923
- Who's the war paint for?
- Go home and dry out.

283
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:26,992
You don't need it for Leo,
believe me.

284
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:29,390
He already thinks you're
the original Miss Jesus.

285
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:31,500
- What the hel"s
the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

286
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,952
- Afraid people might get
the right idea?
- Leo's got the right idea.

287
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,638
I like him.
He's honest and he's got a heart.

288
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,939
Then it's true what they say--
opposites attract.

289
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:43,296
- Do me a favor.
Mind your own business.
- This is my business.

290
00:21:43,488 --> 00:21:46,077
Intimidating helpless women
is part of what I do.

291
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,283
- Then find one
and intimidate her.
-Leo's upstairs...

292
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:50,585
getting ready to shoot himself
in the foot on your account.

293
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,504
-I don't know
what you're talkin'about.
- He's gonna go to the mat...

294
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,422
for your brother,
and it's gonna hurt him.

295
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,628
I don't know Leo's business,
but he's a big boy.

296
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,642
- He used to be.
- Look, what do you want, Tom?

297
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,423
You want me to pretend
I don't care what happens to Bernie?

298
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:04,109
Well, I do.
He's my brother. I don't
want to see him get hurt.

299
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:08,329
If Leo wants to help out,
I'll step out with him,
show him a good time in return.

300
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:11,685
- There's no harm in that.
- There's a name for that kind
of business arrangement.

301
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:15,138
Look, I'll do what I have to do
to protect Bernie.

302
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,536
There's no reason for you
to try and queer that.

303
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,125
Regardless of what
you think about me,
Bernie's a decent guy.

304
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,674
- A straight shooter, huh?
A square "G."
- Yeah.

305
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,702
Sneer at him like everyone else,
just because he's different.

306
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:30,387
People think he's a degenerate.
People think he's scum.

307
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:33,936
- Well, he's not.
-Poor misunderstood Bernie.

308
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,429
What is this about, Tom?

309
00:22:36,525 --> 00:22:39,690
You want me to stop seeing Leo?
Why don't you just say so?

310
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,773
I want you to quit
spinning Leo in circles
and pointing him where to go.

311
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:47,267
- I forgot. That's your job.
- I'll do what I have to do
to protect Leo.

312
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,527
I'm asking you politely.
Leave him alone.
I don't have to ask.

313
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,693
If I told him about our little
dance last night, your pool
would pretty soon dry up.

314
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,707
So would yours.
I don't like being threatened.

315
00:22:55,899 --> 00:22:59,735
I don't like being taken for
a sucker. That might work with
Leo, but it don't work with me.

316
00:23:00,023 --> 00:23:02,996
Do you think last night
was just more campaigning
for my brother?

317
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:04,818
I can see the angles.

318
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,928
You know, if there was a market
for little old ladies,

319
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,942
you'd have Grandma Bernbaum
first in line.

320
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,628
- You're a pathetic rumhead.
- And I love you, angel.

321
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:30,330
I suppose you think
you raised hell.

322
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:37,618
Sister, when I've raised hell,
you'll know it.

323
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,174
- Yeah.
- Lazarre wants
his money. He wants it now.

324
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,763
- I need a couple of days.
- Yeah? How come is that?

325
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,791
- Because I don't have it.
- All right, welsher, how do I
know you ain't got it?

326
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,819
- Because I say so.
- That ain't gonna be good enough.

327
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:30,272
- What would be good enough?
- Lazarre ain't gonna
like it one bit.

328
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,245
Tell Lazarre if he's not happy,
he can send someone over
to break my legs.

329
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:36,122
I won't squawk.

330
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,342
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hello, Tom.

331
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,795
- What's the rumpus?
-Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

332
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,384
Yeah, you weren't here,
so I thought I'd do that.

333
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:48,686
I didn't want to answer
the phone, though. I figured...

334
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:50,604
it wasn't for me.

335
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:55,017
I get it. Get to the point, huh?

336
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:57,702
Okay. The point is,
I'm a good guy.

337
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,812
I've heard that
from a lot of people today.

338
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,730
Good guy, lots of friends.
That's the way it works.

339
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:06,046
Maybe if you appreciated me
a little more, you wouldn't
be making waves with Leo.

340
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:08,827
It's a bad time to be
doing that. Right now,
we're both in a jam.

341
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:12,376
I hear you're on a bad streak.
Short of funds.

342
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:15,733
Well, I got that crazy dago
mad at me.

343
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,651
Don't ask me why.
I'm just a small-timer...

344
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,952
trying to get by
like everyone else.

345
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,830
I need help from my friends
like Leo and you.

346
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,940
Leo gets your sister.
What are you sellin' me?

347
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,337
Come on, Tom.
It's not like that at all.
It wasn't my idea.

348
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,447
She'll sleep with anyone.
You know that.

349
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:32,900
She even tried to teach me
a thing or two about bed artistry.

350
00:25:33,187 --> 00:25:35,777
Can you believe that?

351
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:38,079
My own sister.

352
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:42,970
Some crackpot idea about
saving me from my friends.

353
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:45,176
She's a sick twist, all right.

354
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:48,820
- She speaks highly of you.
- Yeah, well, you stick
by your family.

355
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,411
The point is, I can help you
with your debts if that
would make us friends.

356
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:54,767
My motto is,
"A guy can't have too many."

357
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:57,836
Big payday Saturday, Tom.
You could be in on it.

358
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,234
Another fix? Which fight?

359
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:04,166
That's confidential
at the moment. But it
doesn't have to stay that way.

360
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:06,468
How come you know
so much about it?

361
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,578
Caspar isn't laying
any more bets with you.

362
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:16,155
You really must have Mink
jumping through hoops.

363
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,319
Like I say, you can't
have too many.

364
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:27,376
- We got a deal?
- I'll think about it.

365
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:31,979
I wouldn't want it any other way.

366
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:37,253
Hey, Adolph.

367
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:41,952
- My credit still
good with you?
- Mmm.

368
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,542
Give me a hundred across on Tailor Made
in the third tonight.

369
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,898
- Lazarre won't like it.
- Try 50 across.

370
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,296
I'll try.
It's another 1 50 you'll owe him.

371
00:26:50,488 --> 00:26:53,654
- Only if I lose, Adolph.
- Tommy, the way you're goin'--

372
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:57,202
- Hey, horses got knees?
- I don't know. Fetlocks.

373
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,943
Well, if I was a horse,
I'd be down on my fetlocks
praying you don't bet on me.

374
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,436
- Drift, small guy.
- Drop dead, ape.

375
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,738
Come on, Tom.
Boss wants to see ya.

376
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,040
He didn't have time
to engrave nothin' formal.

377
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:31,633
What you mean, he's eatin' too much?
What's the goddamn doctor know?

378
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,373
- What you eat for lunch?
- A hot dog.

379
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:38,922
-Just a hot dog?
- A hot dog and mustard.

380
00:27:39,113 --> 00:27:43,333
A hot dog and mustard.

381
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,594
A hot dog and mustard!

382
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,062
You hear that, Dane?
My kid is as smart as a whip.

383
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,843
Even Uncle Eddie
thinks that's funny.

384
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:57,720
Okay.

385
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,228
Go ahead. Which hand
is the penny in?

386
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,872
Choose again.

387
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,778
Okay. Here you go.
Take the penny.
Shiny new penny.

388
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:16,518
Take the kid,
wait in the car.
Give him a penny, boys!

389
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:22,080
- I ain't got a penny, boss.
- That's a penny you owe him.

390
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:25,533
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?
You like kids?

391
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,698
- No.
- Have a seat. Go ahead.

392
00:28:30,328 --> 00:28:32,055
Well, you're missin' out
on a complete life.

393
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,548
I know, kids, big deal.

394
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,425
Still, I'm telling you.

395
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:40,878
Anyways, thanks for comin' by.

396
00:28:42,413 --> 00:28:44,810
I just wrote this check out
to your bookmaker Lazarre.

397
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:47,496
It's for an even 1,500,
which is more than I hear
you owe him,

398
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:50,757
but I figured you could always
use some money on the cuff,
a high roller such as yourself.

399
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,826
- What do you say?
- Thanks.

400
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,142
Always the yapper, huh?

401
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:02,362
Well, you're welcome.
You wanna know why I'm puttin'
you square with Lazarre?

402
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:05,623
- Not particularly.
- I want everybody to be friends.

403
00:29:05,815 --> 00:29:08,021
I do this, you're friends
with Lazarre,

404
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:10,610
he's friends with you,
you're friends with me.

405
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:14,830
All you gotta do
to show you're a friend
is give me Bernie Bernbaum.

406
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:18,283
You know it's
the right thing anyway.
The shmatte steals from me.

407
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:22,215
I can't have Leo giving him
a shiny new penny.

408
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,325
So the deal is,
I give you Bernie,

409
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:26,818
smooth it over with Leo
and you bail me out with Lazarre.

410
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,024
Yeah. Then we're all
friends again.

411
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,614
You, me, Leo, the Dane.

412
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,162
- We can maybe
have tea sometime.
- Come on, Eddie.

413
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,135
Friends is a mental state.

414
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:41,684
- What do you say, kid?
- I'll think about it.

415
00:29:41,971 --> 00:29:44,369
You'll think about it.

416
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,342
You hear that, Dane?
The kid's a thinker.
That's terrific.

417
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:51,083
- Does he want
a pillow for his head?
- Okay, kid. Think about it.

418
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:54,824
It's a mental state.
If it'll help you think,

419
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:57,317
you should know that if
you don't do this thing,

420
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,907
you're not gonna be
in any shape to walk out of here.

421
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:04,990
Would that be physically,
or just a mental state?

422
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,964
That ain't friendly, kid.
I make you a nice offer,

423
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:17,458
you give me the high hat.

424
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:58,794
Hold it.

425
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,948
Jesus, Tom.

426
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,900
Just in the nick of time, huh?

427
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,285
Well, no harm done.
Unless your friend broke his foot.

428
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:05,546
- Where am I?
- Where are you? Johnny
Caspar's pleasure dome.

429
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,519
Same as when you left us
about ten seconds ago.

430
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:10,917
Hello, Tom. How are ya?

431
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,027
Care to scrape a knuckle
on your playmate here?

432
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:15,808
- No. Thanks though, Andy.
- Well, if you
change your mind,

433
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:18,973
we'll be interrogating
for a while.

434
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:22,234
- What was that party
about, anyway?
- We do this every weekend.

435
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:24,919
Jesus, what is the matter
with you people?

436
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,700
Well, they said make it hurt,
so we make it hurt.

437
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:35,661
Drink, O'Doole?

438
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:37,867
I'm on duty.

439
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,648
To Volstead.

440
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,005
-
- Any news about Rug?

441
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,498
Still dead, far as I know.

442
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:49,183
- Get a slug out of him?
- Yeah, .22.

443
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,774
Listen, Tom, I'm just
the chief around here,

444
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,980
so don't bother tellin' me
if you don't happen to
feel like it,

445
00:32:54,076 --> 00:32:55,802
but what the hell is Leo doin'?

446
00:32:55,994 --> 00:33:00,118
Make him listen to you, Tom.
It ain't right, all this fuss
over one sheeny.

447
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,995
Let Caspar have Bernie.
What's one Hebrew more or less?

448
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:05,009
We're burnin'
our meal ticket here.

449
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,215
Leo will do what suits him,
and you'll do what he tells you.

450
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,133
Last I heard, Leo was still
running this town.

451
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,722
Yeah, well, he won't be
for long if this keeps up.

452
00:33:11,914 --> 00:33:14,408
It's no good for anyone.
You said as much yourself.

453
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,436
First off, O'Doole, I can
say what I please to Leo
and about him.

454
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,546
You can't.

455
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:23,998
Second, once Leo decides,
that's that.

456
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,396
If that sticks going down,
there are plenty
of coppers I know...

457
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,177
who wouldn't mind
bein' chief and could
swallow it clean.

458
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:33,205
Jesus, Tom,
I was just speculatin'
about a hypothesis.

459
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:35,315
I know I don't
know nothin'.

460
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:37,617
It's just a--
just a damn mess, is all.

461
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,841
Hello, Officer. I'd like to
report an intruder...

462
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:05,815
at 346 West Lewis--

463
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,267
Who's this?
Hello, Shad. Tom Reagan here.

464
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:12,048
- You need the booze?
- No, we won't be
needing any today.

465
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,830
- False alarm, huh?
- Yeah. My mother.
She didn't recognize me.

466
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:17,132
Let me talk to Mulveany.
Miss me?

467
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:19,529
Drop dead.

468
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,639
- Mulveany here.
- Sean?

469
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:23,557
Tell O'Doole to get a car
over to Leo's tonight.

470
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:26,434
If we're banging away
at Caspar, we oughta be ready
for him to bang back.

471
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:28,640
-
- What do you want?

472
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:32,285
I was in the neighborhood,
feeling a bit daffy,

473
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,258
so I thought I'd drop in
for an aperitif.

474
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,765
- Rug Daniels is dead.
- Gee, that's tough.

475
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:41,971
Don't get hysterical.

476
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,424
I've had enough excitement
for one night without a dame
going all weepy on me.

477
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,534
- I barely knew the gentleman.
-Rug?

478
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:51,755
A bit of a shakedown artist,
not above the occasional grift.

479
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:55,495
Bet you'd understand that.
All in all, not a bad guy,

480
00:34:55,783 --> 00:34:58,852
if looks, brains
and personality don't count.

481
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:01,537
- You better hope they don't.
- Yeah, well--

482
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,031
We're none of us the saint
I hear your brother is.

483
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:06,237
- Who killed him?
- Leo thinks Caspar did.

484
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:08,251
- But you know better.
- I do now.

485
00:35:08,346 --> 00:35:11,415
You see, Caspar just tried
to buy me into fixing
his tiff with Leo,

486
00:35:11,607 --> 00:35:14,197
which he'd hardly do
if he was waging war.

487
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:18,129
So I figure you killed him, angel.
You or St. Bernard.

488
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:21,773
Why would I or my brother
kill Rug Daniels or anybody else?

489
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:25,706
Rug was following you.
He knew about you and me,

490
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:28,391
and that wouldn't help
your play with Leo, would it?

491
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,501
You think I murdered someone?

492
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:33,474
Come on, Tom.
You know me a little.

493
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,967
Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

494
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:38,173
You know, or you
wouldn't be here.

495
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:41,434
Not at all, sugar.
I came to hear your side of the story.

496
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:45,846
How horrible Rug was,
how he goaded you into it,
how he tried to shake you down.

497
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,052
- That's not why
you came either.
- Tell me why I came.

498
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:51,122
- The oldest reason there is.
- There are friendlier
places to drink.

499
00:35:51,313 --> 00:35:53,136
- Why can't you admit it?
- Admit what?

500
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:56,301
That you don't like
me seeing Leo
'cause you're jealous.

501
00:35:56,492 --> 00:35:58,602
Admit that you've
got a heart,

502
00:35:58,794 --> 00:36:01,096
even though it may be
small and feeble...

503
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,206
and you can't remember
the last time you used it.

504
00:36:03,398 --> 00:36:06,275
If I'd known we were gonna
cast our feelings into words,

505
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:08,864
I'd have memorized
the Song of Solomon.

506
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:13,947
Maybe that's why
I like you, Tom.

507
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:16,633
I never knew anybody
that made being
a son of a bitch...

508
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,414
such a point of pride.

509
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,291
Though one day you'll
pay the price for it.

510
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,278
Okay, Verna.
But until then, let's get stinko.

511
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,772
Let's do something else first.

512
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,677
Yeah. Let's do plenty.

513
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:27,335
- Who's winning?
- We are, for the nonce.

514
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:31,267
- What's the "disposish"?
- Last night, four to one. Dana
Cudahy went up with the house.

515
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,569
- And theirs?
- One burned.

516
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,391
- The other three?
- Lead.

517
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:37,405
- Whose?
- Leo's.

518
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,611
The old man's still
an artist with a Thompson.

519
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,625
Yeah, do that.

520
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:45,269
Well, find him, goddamn it!
Go and see if he fell in the john.

521
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,585
Son of a bitch. No chief.

522
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:52,847
- Who's mindin' the goddamn store?
-Can't raise O'Doole?

523
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,957
No, nor the mayor either.

524
00:40:55,149 --> 00:40:59,177
- That's not good.
They're running.
- They wouldn't dare!

525
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:01,862
I don't know, Leo.
I warned you not to
hit Caspar's club.

526
00:41:02,054 --> 00:41:04,643
- I'm still here, ain't I?
-Caspar's play hurt you anyway.

527
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:07,041
That sorry son of a bitch
just slit his own throat.

528
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:10,110
Listen to me, Leo.
Last night made you
look vulnerable.

529
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:13,563
You don't hold elected office
in this town. You run it
because people think you run it.

530
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:16,248
Once they stop thinking it,
you stop running it.

531
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,509
Jesus, Tom. It sounds like
a bad break for me
I wasn't killed!

532
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:22,578
I mean it, Leo.
Start taking Caspar seriously.

533
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,702
I know, I know.
Retreat to win, give up Bernie.
That'll solve all our problems.

534
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:28,812
Won't anymore, I'll grant you that.

535
00:41:29,003 --> 00:41:31,305
But going toe-to-toe
with a psychopath
will get you nowhere.

536
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,895
It'll force people
to choose sides just when
you're looking shaky.

537
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:37,060
- The hell I do!
- Then where's the mayor?

538
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:39,361
Why aren't there
any police here?

539
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:41,375
Why weren't there any police
at your place last night?

540
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:43,869
- I didn't ask for any.
- I did.

541
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:49,624
Mother hen, huh?
What's the matter, Tommy?

542
00:41:49,816 --> 00:41:53,077
- Don't you think
I can take care of myself?
- I know you can't.

543
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:55,858
Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

544
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,872
you let Caspar think
he's made his point.

545
00:41:58,064 --> 00:42:00,749
- Then you wait for him
to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

546
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,051
You're sticking on Bernie.
You're sticking your neck out...

547
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:05,928
for a guy who'd chop you off
at the heels if there
was two bits in it.

548
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,916
Tom,

549
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:14,176
things aren't as, uh,
clear-cut as you make it.

550
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:19,643
Bernie's--
Well, hell,you know
about me and Verna.

551
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:23,383
Things now are, uh--

552
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:27,028
Not that I haven't
been a gentleman, but--

553
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:32,399
I plan to ask her
to marry me, Tom.

554
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:40,167
I guess you think
that's a bonehead play.

555
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:47,839
- You think she wants you to?
- How the hell do I know?

556
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:50,622
I think she does.
Yeah, of course she does.

557
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:54,362
I know you think different,
but, well, we just, uh--

558
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,760
We just differ on that.

559
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:02,418
Leo, Caspar didn't kill Rug.

560
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,063
- Course he did.
- No. Think about it
just this one time.

561
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,173
- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

562
00:43:08,364 --> 00:43:11,625
It needn't have been that
sinister. Strange man follows
her down a dark alleyway.

563
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:14,023
- I told you she can
look after herself.
- Verna wouldn't panic,

564
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,092
shoot someone just because
he was following her.

565
00:43:17,284 --> 00:43:20,736
Nah, it wouldn't have happened
like that, and if it had
she would have told me.

566
00:43:21,024 --> 00:43:23,997
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.
A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

567
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:26,203
I know you don't
like her, Tom,

568
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:29,080
but I trust Verna
as much as I trust you.

569
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,533
Okay, Leo.

570
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:34,739
Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

571
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,287
Maybe Rug knew something
she didn't like him knowing
and wouldn't want you to know.

572
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,932
Rug was following her.
Maybe he knew
where she was sleeping,

573
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:43,850
and who with.

574
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:50,181
Maybes don't make it so.

575
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,154
There's more than maybes.

576
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:56,606
You've trusted me before,
you've never lost anything
by it. Trust me on this.

577
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,648
- This is too important.
- I don't ask much,
and I don't ask often.

578
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,046
Trust me on this.

579
00:44:05,238 --> 00:44:08,211
- Tommy.
- Trust me on this,
or to hell with you.

580
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:13,006
You don't mean that.

581
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:17,610
She was with me...

582
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:20,871
the night Rug
was following her,

583
00:44:21,062 --> 00:44:22,885
the night you dropped by.

584
00:44:36,024 --> 00:44:38,230
Oh.

585
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:32,264
Okay, Leo. Okay.
I'll throw him out.

586
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,772
Yeah, do that.

587
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,937
It's the kiss-off.

588
00:46:40,128 --> 00:46:43,197
If I never see him again,
it'll be soon enough.

589
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:55,091
- Hello?
- Hello, Frankie.

590
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,489
It's Tom.
How's the flunky business?

591
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:00,941
I've had worse.
Your ventilator mending?

592
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:04,010
-
- Tell Caspar it's forgotten.

593
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:06,408
- I'd like to see him.

594
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:10,148
Ah. All right, let me know.

595
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,334
It worked, whatever you did.

596
00:47:57,622 --> 00:48:00,691
Leo says we're quits.

597
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:03,376
But you know I didn't have
anything to do with Rug.

598
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:06,062
Maybe not.

599
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:08,076
Anyway, that isn't
what soured him on you.

600
00:48:08,267 --> 00:48:10,377
Oh, you and me, huh?

601
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:15,460
You always take
the long way around to get
what you want, don't you, Tom?

602
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,872
You could have just asked.

603
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:25,435
What did I want?

604
00:48:25,626 --> 00:48:28,024
Me.

605
00:48:53,057 --> 00:48:55,646
Yeah?

606
00:48:55,742 --> 00:48:57,564
Yeah, yeah.

607
00:48:57,756 --> 00:48:59,866
When?

608
00:49:00,058 --> 00:49:01,784
Okay.

609
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:09,073
You still up?

610
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:11,279
Yeah.

611
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,800
What are you chewin' over?

612
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,102
Dream I had once.

613
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,706
I was walking in the woods.
I don't know why.

614
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:29,213
Wind came whippin'.
Blew me hat off.

615
00:49:31,227 --> 00:49:33,913
And you chased it, right?

616
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,310
You ran and ran.

617
00:49:36,502 --> 00:49:39,379
You finally caught up to it.

618
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:43,407
And you picked it up,
but it wasn't a hat anymore.

619
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:47,340
It had changed into something else,
something wonderful.

620
00:49:47,435 --> 00:49:50,122
No, it stayed a hat.

621
00:49:50,218 --> 00:49:52,519
And no, I didn't chase it.

622
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,507
Nothing more foolish
than a man chasin' his hat.

623
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,808
Where are you going?

624
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,494
Just have to do a few things.

625
00:50:02,686 --> 00:50:05,850
- You and Leo might still
be able to patch things up.
- Me and Leo are finished.

626
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:09,207
-Nothing's gonna change that.
- You never know.

627
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:12,948
- He's got a big heart.
- We're quits as far as I'm
concerned, never mind him.

628
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:17,071
And if Leo did want me back,
he's an even bigger sap
than I thought.

629
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,661
Then why don't we just
pick up and leave town?

630
00:50:19,757 --> 00:50:22,442
There's nothing keeping you here.

631
00:50:22,538 --> 00:50:24,360
I know there's nothing keeping me.

632
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,621
- What about Bernie?
- He could go with us.

633
00:50:28,964 --> 00:50:30,882
You, me and Bernie?
Where would we go, Verna?

634
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:32,896
Niagara Falls?

635
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:34,814
Why do you hate him?

636
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:36,732
- I don't hate anyone.
-Or like anyone.

637
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,638
Where is Bernie?

638
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,035
- Why?
- Leo can't protect him anymore.

639
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:49,393
I oughta tell him to skip.

640
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,407
The Royale, room 302.

641
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:59,943
I guess we both
double-crossed Leo, huh?

642
00:51:00,134 --> 00:51:01,861
There's no gettin' around that.

643
00:51:03,107 --> 00:51:05,697
I guess he's well rid
of both of us.

644
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:09,917
The two of us, we're about
bad enough to deserve each other.

645
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,192
Are we?

646
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:19,987
We're a couple of heels, Tom.

647
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,576
Yes, we are.

648
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:26,892
So he says,
"Screw him. Give him a dollar.
This was my idea. "

649
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,537
Hello, Tom.

650
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:33,798
Uh, you know O'Doole
and the mayor.

651
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:36,962
- Hello, boys.
- Tom's a big booster.
Always has been.

652
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:40,895
That's fine, that's fine.
Well, Tom and I got
the proverbial fat to chew.

653
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,772
-Just let us know
if you need anything.
- Yeah. Happy days.

654
00:51:43,964 --> 00:51:46,745
Have a seat, kid.
Yeah, that's it.

655
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:50,103
So,you had enough time
to think about things?

656
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:54,035
- Yeah, well, uh,
circumstances have changed.
- Don't I know it.

657
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:57,104
Last night I know the Dane
was disappointed
the bulls showed up...

658
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:59,693
before Frankie and Tic-Tac
really pinned your ears back,

659
00:51:59,885 --> 00:52:04,009
but I said, "Relax, Eddie.
I got a feeling about this kid.

660
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:08,133
The kid and Leo
are gonna go bust-o.
Matter of time."

661
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:10,914
I said, "The kid
is too smart for Leo."
That's what I said.

662
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:13,887
Like a psychic.
Ask the Dane if I did.
Like a goddamn psychic.

663
00:52:13,983 --> 00:52:16,285
-Go ahead, ask him.
- You vouch for that
psychic business?

664
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:18,874
- That's right, smart guy.
-I know you knew...

665
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,752
protecting the shmatte
was a dumb idea.

666
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,492
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.

667
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:27,602
Only a matter of time-- bust-o.

668
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:30,671
That's why last night
we didn't put the arm on you,
only Leo.

669
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:34,028
Seeing how you squiffed
your play on Leo,
I can only be so grateful.

670
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:38,248
- Oh, that's real brave coming
from Little Miss Punching Bag.
- Okay, Eddie.

671
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:41,508
- Friends now, huh?
- Nuts.

672
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:45,057
So, I guess you'll be
looking for a job, eh, kid?

673
00:52:45,153 --> 00:52:47,646
I might be.

674
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:49,661
You got references?
You been to college?

675
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:53,018
We only take yeggs
what's been to college.
Ain't that right, Dane?

676
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:58,868
I'm joking, of course.
We all know you could be
useful to us,

677
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:00,882
a smart kid such as yourself.

678
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:04,431
The man who walks behind the man,
who whispers in his ear.

679
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,075
- I guess you could be
useful in spades.
- Yeah, I can do plenty for you.

680
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:12,391
- Can you get Leo off me?
- I'm tellin' you
not to worry about Leo.

681
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,405
- We got plans for him.
- Oh,yeah?

682
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:17,091
- Like what?
- Not so fast there, "kaputnik."

683
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:19,584
I-I think what the Dane
is trying to say is,

684
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:21,694
there'll be time
to talk about that.

685
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,900
We can table that
for a later date.

686
00:53:25,434 --> 00:53:29,654
See, last time we jawed,
you gave me the high hat.

687
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:32,244
I guess I'm sayin'...

688
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:35,696
you gotta put something
on the table first.

689
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:38,382
- Ante up.
- Fair enough. Where do we start?

690
00:53:38,574 --> 00:53:41,834
Hear that, Dane? All business.
I told you he was a good kid.

691
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:44,040
"Where do we start?"
All business.

692
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:47,013
Well, we can start, for instance,
with the shmatte.

693
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:49,028
Like, where's the shmatte?
You could maybe tell us that.

694
00:53:49,124 --> 00:53:52,961
The Royale, room 302.
And you might find Mink with him.

695
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:55,070
The hell you say.

696
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,180
Sure. Bernie and Mink
are cozy as lice.

697
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,345
- And it ain't just business.
- This guy is lying.

698
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:02,263
- Why would I?
- This guy is wrong.

699
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:07,155
This guy is all wrong.
Mink is clean and this clown
is a smart guy.

700
00:54:09,073 --> 00:54:10,895
It's easy enough to find out,
ain't it?

701
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:16,266
You find Mink,
you bring him back here.

702
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,732
Go to the car.
I'm gonna send Frankie and
Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.

703
00:54:21,924 --> 00:54:24,034
If Bernie's there,

704
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,336
Frankie and Tic-Tac'll
take care of him.

705
00:54:26,528 --> 00:54:28,734
And if he's not there?

706
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:31,994
I'll sit facing the corner
in a funny hat.

707
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:36,214
- Get your little hebe ass
in the car.

708
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,324
- Let's go.
Come on,you skel.

709
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,338
What are you doing to me?

710
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,448
- We're going to
Miller's Crossing.
-I didn't do-- Tom! Tom!

711
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,942
- Lock him up.
Jesus! Are you part of this?

712
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,052
- Sit still, hymie.
- You can't be part of this.

713
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:49,738
I think these guys
are gonna whack me!
Tom,you gotta talk to 'em!

714
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:52,519
- You're giving me a headache,
you little sheeny. Let's go!
- Talk to 'em!

715
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:57,794
Get me outta here!

716
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,192
Oh, Tommy.!

717
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,206
Get him outta here!
- Frankie!

718
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:05,083
- Come on! Come on!

719
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:09,303
- Tic-Tac!
- Quiet him down!

720
00:55:09,495 --> 00:55:11,317
Uuh!

721
00:55:11,317 --> 00:55:13,331
- Get up, you skel!

722
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:15,345
- Come on.
- Frankie, no!

723
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:18,702
- Get up, you son of a bitch.
- Frank-- Aah!

724
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,387
- Oh, Frankie!
- Get up, you kike!

725
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:25,127
Okay, take him in the woods
and whack him.

726
00:55:25,415 --> 00:55:27,429
- What?
- That's right.

727
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,210
The boss wants you to do it.
Make sure you're with the good guys.

728
00:55:30,498 --> 00:55:33,088
- You know how to do this, right?
- You little yid! Get up!

729
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:35,198
Ya gotta remember
to put one in his brain.

730
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:38,171
Your first shot puts him down.
Then you put one in his brain.

731
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:40,185
Then he's dead.
Then we go home.

732
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:45,843
Get up and walk.

733
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:48,145
I can't get up. I can't get up.

734
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:53,037
- Get up and walk,
you pissing little yid!
- Let's go!

735
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,287
Tommy, you can't do this.
You don't bump guys.

736
00:56:15,383 --> 00:56:17,589
You're not like
those animals back there.

737
00:56:19,987 --> 00:56:22,001
It's not right, Tom.

738
00:56:22,193 --> 00:56:24,399
They can't make us do this.

739
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,427
It's a wrong situation.
They can't make us
different people than we are.

740
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:30,537
We're not muscle.
I never killed anybody.

741
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:33,030
I used a little information
for a chisel, that's all.

742
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:35,620
It's my nature, Tom.
I can't help it.

743
00:56:35,811 --> 00:56:39,360
Somebody hands me an angle,
I play it. I don't deserve
to die for that.

744
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:41,278
Do you think I do?

745
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,457
I'm just a grifter.
Huh, Tom? I'm a nobody!

746
00:56:46,649 --> 00:56:49,815
But I tell you what--
I never crossed a friend.

747
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:52,308
I never killed anybody,
I never crossed a friend.

748
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,226
We're not like those animals.

749
00:56:54,418 --> 00:56:56,145
This is not us.

750
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:58,734
This is a dream!

751
00:56:58,926 --> 00:57:01,899
It's a dream, Tommy!
I'm praying to you!

752
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:03,817
I can't die.

753
00:57:04,009 --> 00:57:05,735
I can't die...

754
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:09,380
out here in the woods
like a dumb animal.

755
00:57:09,475 --> 00:57:11,777
In the woods like a dumb animal!

756
00:57:11,873 --> 00:57:14,654
Like a--
Like a dumb animal!

757
00:57:14,942 --> 00:57:18,299
I can't--
I can't-- I can't die
out here in the woods...

758
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:20,888
like a dumb animal.

759
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,149
I can't... die!

760
00:57:27,985 --> 00:57:29,712
I'm praying to you.

761
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:34,027
Look in your heart.

762
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:36,137
I'm praying to you.

763
00:57:37,384 --> 00:57:41,316
Look in your heart.
I'm praying to you.

764
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:44,098
Look in your heart.

765
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:47,358
I'm praying to you!

766
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,469
Look in your heart!

767
00:57:51,004 --> 00:57:53,881
I'm praying to you!
Look in your heart.

768
00:57:54,073 --> 00:57:56,950
I'm praying to you!

769
00:57:57,238 --> 00:58:01,170
Look in your heart!
Look in your heart!

770
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,471
You can't kill me.

771
00:58:03,663 --> 00:58:06,348
- Look in your heart.

772
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:23,803
- Tommy--
- Shut up. You're dead. Get me?

773
00:58:26,392 --> 00:58:28,790
I understand. I'm dead.

774
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:31,188
- God bless you.
-Shut up.

775
00:58:31,284 --> 00:58:34,448
You have to disappear for good.
No one can see you.
No one can know.

776
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:37,709
- God bless you.
-Go somewhere no one knows you.

777
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:41,066
Anyone sees you,
you really are dead.
You're not my problem anymore.

778
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,560
Of course not.
You've done your share. Thank you.

779
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:46,437
- Don't worry. I understand.
-Shut up. Shut up.

780
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:49,890
- Thank you.
- Shut up. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

781
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:52,480
God bless you.

782
00:59:22,307 --> 00:59:24,129
Put one in his brain?

783
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:27,294
- Yeah.
Atta boy.

784
00:59:43,406 --> 00:59:45,516
Mink? Tom Reagan.
Where you been?

785
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:54,532
Will you look?
Eddie Dane's been looking for you.

786
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:56,450
- Bernie's dead.
-Jesus Christ!

787
00:59:56,642 --> 01:00:00,478
Stop wailing and listen to me.
Caspar knows you were
in on selling out his fix.

788
01:00:00,766 --> 01:00:02,876
- Who the hell
gave him that idea?
- Heh!

789
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:06,329
- I guess I gave him that idea.
Sorry. It just slipped out.
- What are you trying to do?

790
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,206
Shut up and let me talk.
You lay low till Caspar
cools off.

791
01:00:09,494 --> 01:00:13,809
Then tell him the Dane was in
on the sellout, and I'll
make Caspar go easy on you.

792
01:00:14,097 --> 01:00:16,782
- You got me into this mess.
- That's right, I got you into this.

793
01:00:16,974 --> 01:00:20,235
-Just remember, Mink, I'm the
only one who can get you out.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

794
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:23,016
Waah! Uuh!

795
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:33,470
Hello, Terry.
Getting out the vote?

796
01:00:33,662 --> 01:00:38,841
A message from Leo.
Leo says if you're smart
you'll sit this one out,

797
01:00:39,129 --> 01:00:41,430
not that he cares one way
or the other.

798
01:00:41,622 --> 01:00:45,746
Leo says if you're on
the wrong side you take
your chances like anybody else.

799
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:48,337
Leo says he gives
no special favors, that's all.

800
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:51,214
Tell Leo he's not God
on the throne.

801
01:00:51,502 --> 01:00:54,858
He's just a cheap political boss
with more hair tonic than brains.

802
01:00:54,954 --> 01:00:58,311
Uhh!

803
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:02,914
Did Leo say that as well?

804
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:04,833
No, I said that.

805
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,285
Cross Leo,
next time I'll say plenty.

806
01:01:15,286 --> 01:01:18,068
When you're right,you're right.

807
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:21,232
But you never say,
"I told you so."

808
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,438
So what am I right about?

809
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,275
Well, I'll tell you.

810
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:30,919
But first you gotta promise
not to say I told you so.

811
01:01:31,207 --> 01:01:34,947
I never say that,
and I don't like people who do.

812
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:39,838
Mink was robbing me
right along with the shmatte.

813
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,756
What convinced you of that?

814
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:43,962
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

815
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,360
The Dane, he's making
excuses for him.

816
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:48,759
But personally,
I think you was right.

817
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:51,348
I think that Mink and Bernie
was in it together.

818
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:54,801
I think Mink heard
that you bumped
the shmatte and lit out.

819
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:57,007
Lousy son of a bitch.

820
01:01:58,829 --> 01:02:02,090
- I told you so.
- What?

821
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:07,748
You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

822
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,817
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

823
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,845
You was a good sport
to bump the shmatte.

824
01:02:15,996 --> 01:02:17,914
How do you know
Mink skipped?

825
01:02:18,106 --> 01:02:20,695
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

826
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,628
- Meaning what exactly?
-Maybe nothing.

827
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:28,656
I didn't give it much thought,
'cause a guy'll say anything
when his number is up.

828
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:31,437
But, uh,just before
I bumped Bernie,

829
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:34,410
he swore to me
that Eddie Dane and Mink
were setting him up--

830
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:37,287
that they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

831
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,453
Well, uh--

832
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:49,756
Well, like you say, uh,
a guy'll say anything.

833
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:52,154
So why isn't
Eddie Dane here?

834
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,278
Well, he don't
care for you, kid.

835
01:02:57,428 --> 01:03:00,114
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

836
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:03,566
After you left us,
he tried to sell me
on a double-cross.

837
01:03:03,758 --> 01:03:06,444
He says to me,
why don't we double-cross you
and give you the bump...

838
01:03:06,635 --> 01:03:08,362
after we get the shmatte.

839
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:12,198
Well, I figure a dea"s a deal.
You're square with me.

840
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:16,706
You bump the shmatte,
I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

841
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,926
Everything above board so
everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

842
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,337
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

843
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:27,255
We go back.

844
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:33,969
Of course there's always
that wild card when,
uh, love is involved.

845
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,956
I know Mink
is Eddie Dane's boy.

846
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,368
Still, I--
I don't make it that way.

847
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,260
- Then there's nothing
to worry about.
- Yeah.

848
01:03:48,548 --> 01:03:52,480
Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister! Papa, Papa,
I got a prize from the sister!

849
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:55,932
- Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister!
- Yeah.Just a minute.

850
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:58,042
- Of course, then, there's
no reason-- Shut up!
- Papa, Papa, I got--

851
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:01,399
You take a page
out of this guy's book.

852
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:05,235
- A little less you talk,
a little more you think!

853
01:04:07,633 --> 01:04:09,743
Kids. You gotta be firm.

854
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:14,250
Anyways, there's no reason
not to check things out.

855
01:04:14,538 --> 01:04:17,703
If Mink is around,
I want you to find him.
He can tell us what's what.

856
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:20,676
What's the matter?
Somebody hit you?

857
01:04:20,964 --> 01:04:23,553
What's the matter?
Aren't we friends anymore?

858
01:04:23,649 --> 01:04:26,431
If you find him,
I wanna talk to him alone.

859
01:04:26,526 --> 01:04:28,924
That's the way you get
the straight dope--man to man.

860
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:32,569
Just me, Mink...
and my friend Roscoe.

861
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,254
You understand
what I'm saying?

862
01:04:35,446 --> 01:04:37,652
- It ain't complicated.

863
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:52,038
You should leave town
for a few days. Things are
gonna heat up around here.

864
01:04:52,326 --> 01:04:54,532
Go to the Palisades.
I'll join you soon as I'm done.

865
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,409
I can't find Bernie.
Did you find him?

866
01:04:58,848 --> 01:05:00,574
Yeah.

867
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,780
Is he leaving?

868
01:05:02,972 --> 01:05:07,000
He, uh-- He left.

869
01:05:07,192 --> 01:05:09,589
- He say where to?
- He didn't say.

870
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,795
- You--
- Thanks.

871
01:05:24,934 --> 01:05:28,003
- What's that
potato-eater up to?
- Beats me.

872
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,497
- That's Bernie's sister, ain't it?
- Beats me.

873
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:32,895
- What's he seeing her for?
- Beats me. Maybe--

874
01:05:33,086 --> 01:05:36,539
Shut up. Get lost.

875
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:39,033
I'll see where
the twist flops.

876
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:43,540
You know who I am?

877
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,130
Yeah,Johnny Caspar's shadow.
What, did he stay in bed today?

878
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:50,063
Jesus. I open my mouth,
the whole world turns smart.

879
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:53,515
- You're Leo's twist, right?
- Me and Leo are through.

880
01:05:53,803 --> 01:05:56,297
Yeah?
So you're sluttin' around
with Tom now, huh?

881
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:58,982
You get outta here.

882
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:01,284
Okay. See you later.

883
01:06:03,394 --> 01:06:05,600
Before I go,
what's your boyfriend up to?

884
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,710
- Nothing I know about.
- Yeah?

885
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:09,819
That doesn't
figure for me--

886
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:12,888
you dumpin' Leo for the guy
who put a bullet in your brother.

887
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:21,041
He didn't tell you. Aww.

888
01:06:21,328 --> 01:06:23,055
Spin her, Eddie.

889
01:06:24,205 --> 01:06:26,507
Ooh!

890
01:06:41,948 --> 01:06:45,784
- You Leo's?
- Yeah. He wanted her
looked-out for.

891
01:06:45,976 --> 01:06:49,909
Well,you did a bang-upjob.
I'll be sure to tell him.

892
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:53,841
- Where's Leo?
- If I tell you, how do I know
you won't kill me?

893
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:58,924
Because if you told me and I
killed you and you were lying,
I wouldn't get to kill you then.

894
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,610
- Where's Leo?
- He's moving around.

895
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:05,542
- He's getting his mob together
tomorrow at Whiskey Nick's.
- You sure?

896
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,556
Check it. It's gold.

897
01:07:07,748 --> 01:07:11,105
You know what,yegg?
I believe you.

898
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:34,314
Go ahead and run, sweetie.

899
01:07:34,506 --> 01:07:37,671
I'll track down
all of you whores.

900
01:08:35,598 --> 01:08:39,051
Hello, Bernie. Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

901
01:08:39,242 --> 01:08:42,024
Hello, Tom.

902
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:45,668
I thought I'd do that,
since you didn't seem to be in.

903
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:49,793
Figured it was a bad idea
to wait in the hall, seeing
as I'm supposed to be dead.

904
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,164
How'd you know it was me?

905
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,562
You're the only one I know
who'd knock and then break in.

906
01:08:57,753 --> 01:08:59,576
Your other friends
wouldn't break in?

907
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:02,645
My other friends
want to kill me,
so they wouldn't knock.

908
01:09:02,836 --> 01:09:05,138
What's on your mind. Bernie?

909
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:09,742
Things.

910
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,921
I guess you must be angry.
I'm supposed to be
gone far away.

911
01:09:15,112 --> 01:09:17,990
I guess it seems sort of
irresponsible, my being here.

912
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:23,840
And I was gonna leave.
Honest, I was.

913
01:09:23,936 --> 01:09:25,758
But then I started thinking...

914
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:28,539
if I stuck around,
that would not be good for you.

915
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,225
Then I started
thinking that--

916
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,622
that might not
be bad for me.

917
01:09:36,883 --> 01:09:39,377
You didn't see
the play you gave me.

918
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:41,678
I mean, what am I gonna do?

919
01:09:41,774 --> 01:09:44,460
If I leave, I got nothing.

920
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:47,146
No money, no friends, nothing.

921
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:49,352
If I stay, I got you.

922
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:53,668
Anyone finds out I'm alive,
you're dead, so...

923
01:09:55,874 --> 01:09:57,792
I got-- I got you, Tommy.

924
01:10:00,285 --> 01:10:03,450
What's the matter?
You got nothing
to crack wise about?

925
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:05,848
Bernie ain't
so funny anymore?

926
01:10:09,013 --> 01:10:11,698
I guess I made kind of
a fool of myself out there...

927
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,302
bawling away like a twist.

928
01:10:16,493 --> 01:10:18,699
I guess--

929
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:20,617
I guess I turned yellow.

930
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:24,262
- You didn't tell anyone
about that?
- No.

931
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:26,372
Of course,
you know about it.

932
01:10:30,304 --> 01:10:32,318
It's a painful memory...

933
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,648
and I can't help remembering
that you put the finger on me,

934
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,717
and you took me out there
to whack me.

935
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:45,265
I know... you didn't.
I know.

936
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:49,007
- You didn't shoot me, but--
- But what have I done
for you lately?

937
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:51,117
Don't smart me.

938
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,857
See, I want
to watch you squirm.

939
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,789
I want to see you
sweat a little.

940
01:11:00,707 --> 01:11:02,625
And when you smart me...

941
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,366
it ruins it.

942
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,162
There's one other thing I want.

943
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,670
I want to seeJohnny Caspar
cold and stiff.

944
01:11:22,766 --> 01:11:25,931
That's what you'll do
for your friend Bernie.

945
01:11:29,095 --> 01:11:32,069
In the meantime,
I'll stay out of sight.

946
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:35,425
But if Caspar ain't stiff
in a couple of days...

947
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:37,535
I start eating
in restaurants.

948
01:11:50,963 --> 01:11:52,977
Oof!.

949
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,403
Uuh!

950
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:01,513
You make me laugh, Tommy.

951
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,965
You're gonna catch cold.
Then you're no good to me.

952
01:12:05,061 --> 01:12:07,747
What were you gonna do
if you caught me?

953
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:11,199
I'd just squirt a few,
and then you'd let me go again.

954
01:12:18,009 --> 01:12:21,078
Hello, Tad.
How's the club holding up?

955
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,626
We're managing to squeak by
without you.
Got Lazarre's money?

956
01:12:24,914 --> 01:12:27,791
- No.
- You're not supposed to be here
since you turned rat.

957
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:30,285
Relax, Tad.
Leo isn't around, is he?

958
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:34,217
Last couple of days you booked
any heavy bets on a long shot
at Saturday's fights?

959
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:36,423
Why the hell
should I tell you?

960
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:40,067
The truth is, Tad,
no reason on Earth.

961
01:12:42,753 --> 01:12:44,575
Saturday's fights?

962
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:48,316
DropJohnson put two grand
on one yesterday--

963
01:12:48,604 --> 01:12:51,769
on Sailor Reese,
an undercard bum.

964
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:54,742
DropJohnson.
He play your book much?

965
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:58,003
- Are you kidding? I didn't
even know he could count.

966
01:12:58,194 --> 01:13:00,208
Jesus. You bring them with you?

967
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,565
Hello, Brian.
Still fighting the good fight?

968
01:13:03,757 --> 01:13:05,867
Hello, Tom.
Neither rain nor wind nor snow.

969
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,977
That's the mailman. O'Doole here?

970
01:13:14,211 --> 01:13:16,896
Hello, O'Doole.
You don't look happy.

971
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,006
Look at this mess.

972
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,267
Guttin' the golden calf again.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

973
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:25,911
Yeah, it's awful confusing.
You know a yegg
named DropJohnson?

974
01:13:26,103 --> 01:13:28,597
- We spanked him
a couple of times.
- Where does he flop?

975
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:30,803
- Terminal Hotel, Bay Street.

976
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:35,022
Jesus!
Look, don't nobody ask me since
I'm just the chief around here,

977
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,228
but I'll tell you my opinion.

978
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:41,352
Caspar is just as crazy as Leo,
and an "eye-tie"
into the bargain.

979
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,517
What's the matter, O'Doole?
Doesn't anything ever suit you?

980
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:56,890
Hop in, Tom.
We been lookin'for you.

981
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:59,384
- I'm busy.
- Hop in anyway.

982
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:02,549
You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac.
We're on the same side now.

983
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,330
Or didn't you get
that far in school?

984
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:16,071
How'd you get the fat lip?

985
01:14:16,263 --> 01:14:20,291
- Old war wound.
Acts up around morons.
- Very smart.

986
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:23,360
What were you doing
at the club, talking
things over with Leo?

987
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:26,237
Don't think so hard, Eddie.
You might sprain something.

988
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:28,923
You are so goddamn smart.

989
01:14:29,115 --> 01:14:30,841
Except you ain't.

990
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,718
I get you, smart guy.
I know what you are.

991
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,732
Straight as a corkscrew.

992
01:14:35,828 --> 01:14:37,650
Mr. Inside Out-ski,

993
01:14:37,746 --> 01:14:41,582
like some goddamn Bolshevik
picking up his orders
from Yegg Central.

994
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,788
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

995
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,994
You join upJohnny Caspar,

996
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:48,009
you bump Bernie Bernbaum.

997
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:52,421
Up is down. Black is white.

998
01:14:53,763 --> 01:14:56,641
Well, I think you're half smart.

999
01:14:56,737 --> 01:14:59,134
I think you were straight
with your frail,

1000
01:14:59,326 --> 01:15:01,724
I think you were queer
with Johnny Caspar...

1001
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:05,752
and I think you'd sooner
join a ladies' league
than gun a guy down.

1002
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,068
Then I hear from these
two geniuses they never even
saw this rub-out take place.

1003
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:13,808
- Boss said to have him do it.
He didn't say nothing about--
- Shut up!

1004
01:15:14,096 --> 01:15:17,069
Or maybe you still got
too many teeth.

1005
01:15:19,658 --> 01:15:23,494
Everyone is so goddamn smart.

1006
01:15:23,782 --> 01:15:27,235
Well, we'll go out
to Miller's Crossing...

1007
01:15:27,331 --> 01:15:30,112
and we'll see who's smart.

1008
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:57,350
You understand if we don't
find a stiff out here,
we leave a fresh one.

1009
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,436
Where are your friends
when you need 'em, huh?

1010
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,984
Where's Leo now?

1011
01:16:21,998 --> 01:16:24,204
Hey, Tic-Tac!

1012
01:16:24,396 --> 01:16:27,944
You ever notice how
the snappy dialogue dries up...

1013
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,438
once a guy starts
soiling his union suit?

1014
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:16,570
Okay. There's nothing out here.

1015
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:33,641
- Think about this... smart guy.

1016
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,518
It's hanky time.

1017
01:17:41,218 --> 01:17:44,287
- Birds have been at him.

1018
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:46,781
Jesus Christ.

1019
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:14,211
Told you
to put one in his brain,
not in his stinkin' face!

1020
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:21,595
I told you, Dane.
We heard two shots.

1021
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:50,081
Hello, Drop.

1022
01:18:53,725 --> 01:18:55,931
How are the Katzenjammers?

1023
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:58,616
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?

1024
01:19:00,055 --> 01:19:02,068
Had any visitors?

1025
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,178
Uhh, no.

1026
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:06,096
Not ever, Drop?

1027
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:08,014
Not lately.

1028
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:10,508
Then you must be happy to see me.

1029
01:19:13,768 --> 01:19:15,495
So, uh...

1030
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:19,235
you didn't see Bernie Bernbaum
before he was shown across.

1031
01:19:19,427 --> 01:19:21,249
Uh, no.

1032
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:23,263
Seen him since?

1033
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,579
One last question, Drop.

1034
01:19:27,771 --> 01:19:31,991
You got a lot of money
on tomorrow's fight.

1035
01:19:32,278 --> 01:19:36,019
That your bet, or, uh...
you placing it for a friend?

1036
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:38,033
No, no, no, it's my bet.

1037
01:19:38,129 --> 01:19:42,444
- I just have a good feeling
about that fight.
- A good feeling, huh?

1038
01:19:42,732 --> 01:19:45,130
When did a feeling
return to your head?

1039
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:47,720
You've outgrown that one.

1040
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:49,926
Must be all the thinking
you been doing.

1041
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:52,899
Tell Bernie something's come up,
he has to get in touch.

1042
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:55,968
There'll be nothing stirring
till I talk to him.

1043
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:31,837
All right, anyone left in there,
come on out grabbing air.
You know the drill.

1044
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:49,773
Aah!

1045
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:33,602
Hello, Tom.
Where you been hiding?

1046
01:21:33,794 --> 01:21:35,904
Hither and yon.
Is the mayor in?

1047
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:38,301
- He's with Mr. Caspar.
- That's who I'm looking for.

1048
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:41,466
- Scare me up some gargle, will you?
- Sure. I'll announce you.

1049
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:44,151
Don't bother. I'm well-liked.

1050
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:48,756
I can't do it.
I'll look ridiculous.
It simply isn't done.

1051
01:21:48,948 --> 01:21:51,729
-Assistants, maybe.
- For a mayor, you don't hear so hot.

1052
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:54,702
I said head.
Head of the assessor's office.

1053
01:21:54,894 --> 01:21:58,730
- But there are two of them.
- I can count. Co-heads.

1054
01:21:59,018 --> 01:22:01,799
Johnny, needless to say,
this office will do
anything in its power...

1055
01:22:01,991 --> 01:22:04,389
to assist you and your cousins.

1056
01:22:04,581 --> 01:22:06,019
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

1057
01:22:06,115 --> 01:22:08,033
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

1058
01:22:08,129 --> 01:22:11,773
Damn right.
Had every potato-eater from
County Cork on the public tit.

1059
01:22:11,965 --> 01:22:14,171
But there's a way we do things,

1060
01:22:14,363 --> 01:22:17,240
hallowed by usage
and consecrated by time.

1061
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:22,227
- When we put people on the pad
when Leo was running things--
- Leo ain't runnin' things!

1062
01:22:22,419 --> 01:22:26,543
I ain't interested
in ancient history!
I'm runnin'things now!

1063
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:29,037
Nobody can appreciate it
more than I.

1064
01:22:29,228 --> 01:22:31,338
I can give them jobs.
I can give them good jobs.

1065
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,407
I can even give them jobs
where they won't have
to perform any work,

1066
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:37,189
where their lack of English
will be no impediment, but I can't--

1067
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,394
What is this, the high hat?

1068
01:22:39,586 --> 01:22:44,382
Tom, can you explain it to him?
I can put them in public works,
but I can't--

1069
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,397
You can do whatever
the hell Caspar tells you.

1070
01:22:46,588 --> 01:22:48,890
I don't remember
all this double talk
when Leo gave you an order.

1071
01:22:48,986 --> 01:22:52,918
- Tom.Jesus!
- Stop whimpering
and do as you're told.

1072
01:22:53,206 --> 01:22:56,179
- You can start
by gettin'out of here.
-Johnny, it's my office.

1073
01:22:56,275 --> 01:23:00,879
Get out of here!
Take it on the heel and toe
before I whack you one!

1074
01:23:03,276 --> 01:23:05,482
- You two beat it.

1075
01:23:05,578 --> 01:23:09,414
-
- Yeah, go and keep
the mayor company.

1076
01:23:09,702 --> 01:23:12,483
I'll take care
of ya's later.

1077
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,376
- Runnin' things--
it ain't all gravy.

1078
01:23:24,663 --> 01:23:28,404
- What's the fireworks?
-Knocking over one of Leo's clubs.

1079
01:23:28,595 --> 01:23:31,473
Son of a bitch
won't go belly up.

1080
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,638
I'm sorry, kid.
I heard about your
little ride this morning.

1081
01:23:34,829 --> 01:23:36,556
Yeah, well,
sorry don't fix things.

1082
01:23:36,747 --> 01:23:40,296
We could just as easily
have missed Bernie's corpse,
and I'd be dead now.

1083
01:23:40,392 --> 01:23:43,845
I know, I know, but that don't mean
the Dane's up to anything.

1084
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:47,682
So he hears a rumor
that Bernie ain't dead.
These stories pop up.

1085
01:23:47,874 --> 01:23:50,847
Any stories
about Bernie being alive
the Dane's made up himself.

1086
01:23:51,038 --> 01:23:54,587
You don't know that.
It don't make sense. Why would he?

1087
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,081
There could be
a damn good reason...

1088
01:23:58,807 --> 01:24:01,396
if you got
a fixed fight coming up.

1089
01:24:03,698 --> 01:24:06,575
- Do you?
- Maybe.

1090
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:12,042
Okay, yeah, sure.
Tomorrow night.
The fix is in. What of it?

1091
01:24:12,234 --> 01:24:14,344
- The Dane know about it?
- Yeah.

1092
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:20,482
Okay, I get it.

1093
01:24:20,674 --> 01:24:23,359
If the Dane's been selling
you out on these fights
and means to again,

1094
01:24:23,551 --> 01:24:26,428
- he's gonna have to have somebody
else to point the finger at.
- Yeah, I get it.

1095
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,826
With Bernie dead,
there ain't a hell of a lot
of people he can point to.

1096
01:24:29,017 --> 01:24:32,470
Yeah, the Dane sells me out,
makes pretend Bernie's still
doing it.

1097
01:24:32,662 --> 01:24:34,484
That's real pretty.

1098
01:24:34,676 --> 01:24:38,416
Bernie leaked the fix,
and you take the fall
for not killing him.

1099
01:24:40,526 --> 01:24:44,650
But I don't know.
Why would Eddie cross me
like that? Money?

1100
01:24:44,842 --> 01:24:46,953
Okay, everybody likes money,

1101
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:50,022
but somehow it just
don't seem like him.

1102
01:24:50,214 --> 01:24:54,338
- And I know the Dane.
- Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

1103
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:57,119
Money don't mean
that much to him.

1104
01:24:57,311 --> 01:24:59,325
Then it's not just
the money he's after.

1105
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:02,969
- He's got a wart on his fanny.
- Huh?

1106
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:06,518
A wart on his fanny
giving him the fidgets.

1107
01:25:06,614 --> 01:25:08,915
Maybe he's sick of sitting
on the couch.

1108
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:12,080
Maybe behind your desk
don't look like a bad place to move to.

1109
01:25:12,176 --> 01:25:14,478
Kid, you got a lip on you.

1110
01:25:15,725 --> 01:25:17,931
But you're honest.

1111
01:25:18,122 --> 01:25:21,479
That's something we can't
get enough of in this business.

1112
01:25:25,028 --> 01:25:28,193
I'll admit since last we jawed...

1113
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,686
my stomach's
been seizing up on me.

1114
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:33,563
If the Dane's saying
we should double-cross you--

1115
01:25:33,659 --> 01:25:37,591
You double-cross once,
where's it all end?

1116
01:25:37,879 --> 01:25:40,469
An interesting ethical question.

1117
01:25:45,744 --> 01:25:48,717
I'll find the Dane,
talk to him,
straighten things out.

1118
01:25:49,005 --> 01:25:52,170
- Sure, talk to him.
Have a chat.
- I'll take care of it.

1119
01:25:52,266 --> 01:25:55,143
- Ask him if he's selling you out.
I'm sure he'll come clean.
- I'll take care of it.

1120
01:25:55,335 --> 01:25:58,596
- You're swimmin' in it.
- I said I'd take care of it!

1121
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:11,160
-Johnny.

1122
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:15,284
My chin's hanging out
right alongside yours.

1123
01:26:17,106 --> 01:26:20,271
I'd worry a lot less if
I thought you were worrying enough.

1124
01:26:24,682 --> 01:26:26,409
But I am, kid.

1125
01:26:30,053 --> 01:26:31,779
Christ.

1126
01:26:33,122 --> 01:26:35,328
Running things.

1127
01:26:45,302 --> 01:26:47,509
- Yeah?
I got your message.

1128
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:50,578
Oh, Bernie. I had a dream
about you the other day.

1129
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:53,935
- Yeah? A nightmare?
- On the contrary. Very sweet.

1130
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:57,196
I dreamt you were
lying out at Miller's Crossing
with your face blown off.

1131
01:26:57,387 --> 01:27:00,552
You get a kick out of that?
- I was in stitches.

1132
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,429
- It's Mink, isn't it?
- I came back.
He wasn't happy to see me.

1133
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:05,348
- Can you beat that?
- Some friend.

1134
01:27:05,539 --> 01:27:07,362
Yeah. You know what
a nervous boy he was.

1135
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:10,910
I figured you're a friend,
maybe you could use
some insurance.

1136
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:13,020
Did Mink have a .22?

1137
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,911
-He already ditched it. Why?
- After he shot Rug?

1138
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:20,980
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter.

1139
01:27:21,076 --> 01:27:25,488
- I've been thinking about
our deal. You can stick it
in your ear.  - Huh?

1140
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,845
You don't have anything
on me that I don't have on you,
so I'm calling your bluff.

1141
01:27:29,132 --> 01:27:31,242
- Wait a minute.
- I'm pulling out
tomorrow morning.

1142
01:27:31,338 --> 01:27:34,695
You only have to decide
whether or not I leave behind
a message for Caspar...

1143
01:27:34,887 --> 01:27:36,613
that you're still around.

1144
01:27:36,805 --> 01:27:39,011
If you want me to keep
my mouth shut, it's gonna
cost you some dough.

1145
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:41,600
I figure a thousand bucks
is reasonable, so I want two.

1146
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:44,669
- In a pig's eye!
- I'm going out. I'll be back
at 4:00 this morning.

1147
01:27:44,957 --> 01:27:47,643
If you're not here at my place,
4:00, with the dough,

1148
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:50,904
- Caspar's gonna be
looking for you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait!

1149
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:01,646
- Got any money?
- No.

1150
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,290
Okay.

1151
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:20,923
Third race tonight.

1152
01:28:21,019 --> 01:28:24,567
By the finish, Tailor Made
had a view of the field.

1153
01:28:24,855 --> 01:28:27,061
You oughta lay off
the ponies, Tom.

1154
01:28:33,486 --> 01:28:35,213
Okay.

1155
01:28:41,351 --> 01:28:44,612
Lazarre said he's sorry about this.
It's just getting out of hand.

1156
01:28:44,803 --> 01:28:46,627
Yeah.

1157
01:28:46,723 --> 01:28:48,545
He likes you, Tom.

1158
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:51,038
He said we didn't have to
break anything.

1159
01:28:51,901 --> 01:28:53,916
It's okay.

1160
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:56,409
Tell him there's
no hard feelings. Heh!

1161
01:28:56,601 --> 01:29:00,437
Christ, Tom...
he knows that.

1162
01:29:03,123 --> 01:29:05,137
Take care now.

1163
01:29:18,947 --> 01:29:20,769
- Tom Reagan.
- Yes, sir.

1164
01:29:20,865 --> 01:29:24,222
- Mr. Caspar's in the great room.
- Swell. Can you hold these?

1165
01:29:25,852 --> 01:29:27,675
Kid, what's the rumpus?

1166
01:29:27,866 --> 01:29:29,593
I got news.

1167
01:29:29,784 --> 01:29:32,661
Yeah. News at this end too.

1168
01:29:32,852 --> 01:29:35,154
My stomach's been
seizing up on me.

1169
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,744
- Mink just told me that he--
- Eh?

1170
01:29:37,936 --> 01:29:41,196
- You talked to Mink?
- Yeah, on the phone.

1171
01:29:41,388 --> 01:29:44,265
The Dane wants you to think
that he's disappeared
so you can't talk to him,

1172
01:29:44,457 --> 01:29:47,239
- but he's been here in town.
- You sure it was Mink?

1173
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:50,980
Yeah. See for yourself.
He's coming to my place,
4:00 this morning.

1174
01:29:51,267 --> 01:29:54,720
He's afraid of
a crossing with Dane.
He told me about the fix.

1175
01:29:54,912 --> 01:29:57,981
He says he'll sing for
a couple of grand skip money,
tell us everyone involved.

1176
01:29:58,269 --> 01:30:00,474
But you'd better take care
of the Dane tonight.

1177
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:03,256
Mink says he's
coming after us tonight.

1178
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:11,504
Leo's holed up
at Whiskey Nick's dump.

1179
01:30:11,696 --> 01:30:13,518
What? How do you know?

1180
01:30:13,518 --> 01:30:16,395
That ain't all we know, smart guy.

1181
01:30:17,642 --> 01:30:20,615
Recognize your playmate?

1182
01:30:24,643 --> 01:30:27,232
You thought I'd quit, huh? Uh-uh.

1183
01:30:27,424 --> 01:30:30,110
I followed you
this afternoon,

1184
01:30:30,397 --> 01:30:33,754
and I wondered why Einstein
would wanna talk to a gorilla.

1185
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,111
So I grabbed the gorilla,
and I beat it out of him.

1186
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:40,659
You give me a big guy
every time. They break easy.
Not like you.

1187
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:44,016
Is there a point,
or are you just brushing up
on your small talk?

1188
01:30:44,304 --> 01:30:47,470
I like that.
Cool under fire.

1189
01:30:48,716 --> 01:30:50,539
I'm impressed.

1190
01:30:52,169 --> 01:30:55,526
The gorilla didn't know
whose stiff we found,
but I can fill that in.

1191
01:30:55,717 --> 01:30:58,499
You killed Mink,
you son of a bitch!

1192
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:02,910
It was Mink,
you son of a bitch.

1193
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,610
It was Mink, and by God,
I'll hear you say it.

1194
01:31:07,898 --> 01:31:10,103
Is this how you told Drop
his story?

1195
01:31:12,405 --> 01:31:14,515
Come here, bum.

1196
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,133
I am gonna send you
to a deep, dark place,

1197
01:31:21,324 --> 01:31:23,914
and I am gonna have fun doing it.

1198
01:31:39,738 --> 01:31:41,561
Oof!.

1199
01:31:41,753 --> 01:31:46,549
You son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
You lousy son of a bitch!

1200
01:31:46,932 --> 01:31:50,385
If there's one thing
I can't stand,
it's a double-cross artist!

1201
01:31:52,879 --> 01:31:55,660
I had a theory
about this son of a bitch!

1202
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,387
Shut up, you lousy
son of a bitch, or I'll give you
something to holler about!

1203
01:32:04,675 --> 01:32:07,552
Johnny, it's okay.
The Dane made him do it.
It's not important.

1204
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,101
Then make him shut it!

1205
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:14,841
And we do the same to Mink
this very same night!

1206
01:32:15,033 --> 01:32:17,718
We can't double-cross Mink.
He wants to spill the whole setup.

1207
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:21,267
- I've never let
a son of a bitch walk.
- You've never crossed anyone.

1208
01:32:21,459 --> 01:32:24,624
4:00, my place. Mink's
coming in on his own hook,
so I promised him the money.

1209
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:29,803
- Don't make me out
to be a liar.

1210
01:32:32,392 --> 01:32:34,694
Look at this, kid.

1211
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:39,105
Something I try to teach
all my boys.

1212
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:51,095
Always put one in the brain.

1213
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:14,016
What's the rumpus?

1214
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:17,469
I was just in the neighborhood
feeling a little daffy.

1215
01:33:17,757 --> 01:33:19,867
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

1216
01:33:19,963 --> 01:33:22,072
Don't let on more
than you have to.

1217
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:23,991
In the rain.

1218
01:33:28,498 --> 01:33:30,320
Bernie's dead, isn't he?

1219
01:33:31,663 --> 01:33:34,540
- What makes you think that?
- That's no answer.

1220
01:33:39,144 --> 01:33:41,637
I can't tell you
anything yet.

1221
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:44,515
No one really cares, do they?

1222
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:49,407
- His friends
didn't really like him.
- He didn't like his friends.

1223
01:33:49,599 --> 01:33:52,572
You're someone to talk.
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

1224
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:55,545
You got me
to tell you where he was,
and then you killed him.

1225
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:58,710
I want to know why.

1226
01:33:58,806 --> 01:34:02,354
- What was in it for you?
- Nothing for me.

1227
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:10,218
Giving up Bernie was
the only way I could see to
straighten things out for Leo.

1228
01:34:12,232 --> 01:34:14,918
I thought you said
you didn't care about Leo.

1229
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:18,466
I said we were through.
It's not the same thing.

1230
01:34:18,754 --> 01:34:21,056
I don't understand.
I don't care.

1231
01:34:21,248 --> 01:34:24,317
I don't care what reasons you had
or you thought you had.

1232
01:34:24,413 --> 01:34:26,810
He's still alive.

1233
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,838
You expect me to believe you?

1234
01:34:36,017 --> 01:34:37,839
No.

1235
01:34:41,004 --> 01:34:43,882
That's you all over, Tom.

1236
01:34:44,169 --> 01:34:46,376
A lie and no heart.

1237
01:35:03,543 --> 01:35:05,366
Oh--

1238
01:35:12,654 --> 01:35:14,573
It isn't easy, is it, Verna?

1239
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:33,274
But before
you even think about doing
that, you gotta towel down.

1240
01:35:33,466 --> 01:35:38,549
So you towel down first
with a hot towel,
as hot as you can stand.

1241
01:35:38,741 --> 01:35:41,139
Put the razor
in cold water, not hot,

1242
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:43,824
because metal
does what in cold?

1243
01:35:44,112 --> 01:35:48,141
- I don't know,Johnny.
- That's why I'm telling you!
It contracts.

1244
01:35:50,347 --> 01:35:53,895
That way you get
a first-class shave every time.

1245
01:35:54,183 --> 01:35:56,005
Okay,Johnny.

1246
01:35:58,595 --> 01:36:00,513
Ain't it the life though?

1247
01:36:04,061 --> 01:36:07,322
Hello, Sal. You can dangle.

1248
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:12,021
Hello, Tom. You sure?
You don't look so hot.

1249
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:13,940
I'm okay.

1250
01:36:16,625 --> 01:36:18,639
I'll drive him home.

1251
01:37:09,087 --> 01:37:11,676
Mr. Reagan, there were shots.

1252
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:14,553
Go down to the drug store
and call the police.

1253
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,965
You'd better stay there
till the officers arrive.

1254
01:37:20,116 --> 01:37:22,034
Will my cats be all right?

1255
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:24,048
Yeah, they'll be fine.

1256
01:38:13,824 --> 01:38:16,606
I get it. You set me up.

1257
01:38:16,702 --> 01:38:19,483
Anything to avoid
a little dirty work yourself, huh?

1258
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:24,662
How'd you know he'd get it
and not me? Or didn't you care?

1259
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:27,251
I figured you'd come early
looking for blood.

1260
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:30,128
He wouldn't, so you'd likely
have the drop on him.

1261
01:38:31,759 --> 01:38:35,691
You're right.
The chump never knew what hit him.

1262
01:38:35,787 --> 01:38:39,048
But if you knew
I'd come to kill you,
how do you know I won't still?

1263
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:42,021
There's nothing in it
for you now.

1264
01:38:42,213 --> 01:38:44,899
With him dead, you and me
got nothing on each other.

1265
01:38:45,954 --> 01:38:48,256
- Let me have the gun.
- Why?

1266
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,749
Pin this on the Dane.

1267
01:38:50,845 --> 01:38:53,627
Neither of us want him
walking around after this.

1268
01:38:53,818 --> 01:38:57,271
The cops'll be Leo's now.
They won't care what
they hang the Dane for.

1269
01:38:57,463 --> 01:38:59,285
I guess that's true,

1270
01:38:59,477 --> 01:39:03,505
if you don't mind keeping
the gun that killed Caspar
and Mink.

1271
01:39:04,656 --> 01:39:06,862
Why did Mink
shoot Rug anyway?

1272
01:39:07,053 --> 01:39:08,876
I don't know.
It was just a mix-up.

1273
01:39:09,067 --> 01:39:11,273
Here.

1274
01:39:14,055 --> 01:39:17,507
- So you're gonna say
the Dane did this?
- Sure.

1275
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:20,288
Mink thought Rug
was tailing him.

1276
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,878
You know Mink. Hysterical.
Skin full of hop,
head full of boogeymen.

1277
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:27,194
Comes home crying one day,
saying he had to pop
one of the Dane's spies.

1278
01:39:27,481 --> 01:39:30,742
Rug was tailing Verna,
not Mink. Mink just
happened to be with her.

1279
01:39:30,934 --> 01:39:32,756
Funny, ain't it?

1280
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:35,825
Mink was terrified
the Dane'd find out me and him
were jungled up together.

1281
01:39:36,017 --> 01:39:38,798
I bet you kept him
worried about that to
keep him under your thumb.

1282
01:39:39,086 --> 01:39:41,292
Yeah, so what?
Scratch, huh?

1283
01:39:41,484 --> 01:39:43,881
A little bonus.

1284
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:47,143
- Why did Mink take Rug's hair?
- Beats me. The kid was dizzy.

1285
01:39:47,335 --> 01:39:51,171
Fifty-fifty on the dough?
Or maybe I should get more,
since I did the deed.

1286
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:56,350
Okay, you keep it.
I want you to have it.

1287
01:40:02,967 --> 01:40:07,378
Bernie... we can't pin this
on the Dane.

1288
01:40:07,570 --> 01:40:12,941
- Why not?
- Because the Dane's already
dead halfway across town.

1289
01:40:13,229 --> 01:40:16,202
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- Eddie Dane is dead.

1290
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:18,216
It's gotta be you.

1291
01:40:19,846 --> 01:40:22,052
I mean, it was your gun.

1292
01:40:24,354 --> 01:40:28,190
What is this?
What the hell are you talking about?

1293
01:40:28,478 --> 01:40:30,684
You--

1294
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:34,136
You took my gun.
It's just your word against mine.

1295
01:40:37,493 --> 01:40:39,507
Not necessarily.

1296
01:40:40,562 --> 01:40:42,576
Are you crazy?

1297
01:40:42,768 --> 01:40:45,838
We're square.
You said it yourself.
We got nothing on each other.

1298
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:48,236
Yep.

1299
01:40:48,331 --> 01:40:52,455
So what's in it for you?
There's no angle.

1300
01:40:52,647 --> 01:40:55,333
You can't just shoot me
like that.

1301
01:40:58,785 --> 01:41:02,046
Jesus Christ,
it don't make sense.

1302
01:41:04,252 --> 01:41:06,074
Tommy--

1303
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:10,390
Tommy!

1304
01:41:12,116 --> 01:41:13,938
Look in your heart.

1305
01:41:16,432 --> 01:41:18,926
- Look in your heart.
- What heart?

1306
01:42:02,276 --> 01:42:04,194
Tad? It's Tom.

1307
01:42:05,633 --> 01:42:08,414
Tell Lazarre
I got his money.

1308
01:42:08,606 --> 01:42:10,428
Yeah, all of it.

1309
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,305
I wanna place a bet
on tonight's fight.

1310
01:42:18,197 --> 01:42:19,923
- They set you up downstairs?
- How's that?

1311
01:42:20,115 --> 01:42:22,129
A little hooch, whatever?

1312
01:42:22,225 --> 01:42:24,910
Thanks for coming, Tom.
Leo's real anxious to see you.

1313
01:42:25,102 --> 01:42:27,020
Yeah, I happened to be near.

1314
01:42:29,322 --> 01:42:32,295
Well, uh, actually this might
not be the best time.

1315
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:35,172
- Who's he got in there?
- O'Doole and the mayor.

1316
01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:39,680
- I'll try again.
- They're planting the sheeny
tomorrow. You could stop by.

1317
01:43:07,877 --> 01:43:11,234
- Big turnout.
- Drop dead.

1318
01:43:11,426 --> 01:43:13,344
She's under a lot of strain.

1319
01:43:13,536 --> 01:43:16,796
- Yeah, well, at least
she didn't hit me.

1320
01:43:16,892 --> 01:43:20,057
Glad you came, Tommy.

1321
01:43:20,249 --> 01:43:23,797
- I guess, uh-- Huh?
- She's taking the car.

1322
01:43:28,401 --> 01:43:31,278
- I guess we're walkin'.
- Guess we are.

1323
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:38,183
We're, uh--
We're getting married.

1324
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:43,266
Congratulations.

1325
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:48,255
Funny thing is, she asked me to
tie the knot. I guess you're
not supposed to say that.

1326
01:43:48,542 --> 01:43:51,132
- It doesn't matter.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1327
01:43:52,666 --> 01:43:55,352
Hell, Tom, why didn't you
tell me what you were up to?

1328
01:43:55,448 --> 01:43:57,749
I thought you'd
really gone over.

1329
01:43:57,845 --> 01:44:01,202
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

1330
01:44:01,394 --> 01:44:04,655
Telling you would only
have queered things if it--

1331
01:44:04,942 --> 01:44:07,628
There just wasn't any point.

1332
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:09,546
I can see that.

1333
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,862
It was a smart play all around.

1334
01:44:14,053 --> 01:44:16,835
I guess you know I'm grateful.

1335
01:44:17,026 --> 01:44:18,849
No need.

1336
01:44:20,575 --> 01:44:23,164
Heh!
I guess you picked
that fight with me...

1337
01:44:23,356 --> 01:44:26,521
just to check yourself
in with Caspar.

1338
01:44:26,617 --> 01:44:30,166
I don't know.
Do you always know
why you do things, Leo?

1339
01:44:30,453 --> 01:44:32,180
Sure I do.

1340
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:36,879
- It was a smart play.
- Fine.

1341
01:44:40,044 --> 01:44:43,305
Jesus, Tom, I'd do anything
if you'd work for me again.

1342
01:44:43,593 --> 01:44:46,663
I know I've made
some bonehead plays,
I know I can be pigheaded,

1343
01:44:46,758 --> 01:44:49,156
but, damn it, so can you.

1344
01:44:49,252 --> 01:44:53,472
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

1345
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,870
I know it.
I just know it.

1346
01:44:55,965 --> 01:45:00,185
As for you and Verna,
well, I understand.

1347
01:45:00,473 --> 01:45:03,062
You're both young.

1348
01:45:03,158 --> 01:45:05,268
Damn it, Tom, I forgive you.

1349
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,666
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't want it.

1350
01:45:13,804 --> 01:45:15,626
Good-bye, Leo.
