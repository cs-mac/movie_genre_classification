Sure. Go ahead.

May I use the soap too?

156
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:39,480
Also the towel.

Be ready to go in half an hour.

Say, what's goin' on in there?
Sounds like she's taking a shower.

161
00:15:57,162 --> 00:16:00,187
Well, how do you like that? Not so loud.
I don't want her to know you're here.

162
00:16:00,266 --> 00:16:02,597
Why not? Well, I think she's
gonna pull something.

163
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,599
Huh?
I may be wrong, but...

180
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:04,596
Where are you going? I think I'd better
take her down to Palmer Field myself.

181
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:08,070
But you told the general I was gonna do it.
I think I'd better.

182
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:10,801
Who's gonna look after the outfit?
You're second in command.

183
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,171
But you were right in the middle
of those night interception tests.

184
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,919
I said you were second in command.
Besides, you're a married man.

185
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,208
What's that got to do with it?

186

I don't want you exposed to temptation. Now
wait a minute. Maybe you got her all wrong.

187
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:24,140
She really might've gotten soap in her
eyes. It's happened to me lots of times.

Wonder what I did
with the lady's lighter.

194
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:05,635
Did you see it? I didn't know she had one.
What'd you do with it?

Well, if I knew,
I wouldn't ask you.

196
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,275
It isn't possible you were
thinking of something else.

197
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,661
This is just a shot in the dark,

198
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:49,223
but her eyes don't look like
they had soap in 'em.

199
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:59,234
This might be some new form
of Russian propaganda.

200
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,341
Maybe they are actually trying to
make friends and influence people.

201
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,402
Could be.

202

<i>That is correct.</i>

I'm not going to tell you anything

In other words,
you want something for nothing.

Your precious freedom...
it has to be bought?

211
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:03,976
Why not?
We paid a high price for it.

212
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:06,479
And it's getting
scarcer in the world all the time.

213
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:10,379
Exactly. What kind of
people do you think we are?

214
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:14,214
You're trying to confuse me. I won't tell
you anything, I don't care what you say.

215
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:17,845
I can't get used to women soldiers.

216
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,325
I don't like the idea
of putting pressure on a girl like you.

217
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,191
Pressure?

218
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,696
I didn't know they did things
like that in the United States.

219
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,527
What things?
Pressure means torture, doesn't it?

220
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,930
I didn't hear the general say anything
about torture. Did you, Rivers?

221
00:20:41,002 --> 00:20:43,434
I didn't even hear the general
say anything about pressure.

222
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:46,959
Did you, Major?
I didn't hear the general say anything.

223
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,370
You gentlemen are making me feel
very much at home.

224
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:54,102
That's just the way
we want you to feel, Lieutenant.

225
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:57,042
You're a soldier.
Would you have any respect for me...

226
00:20:57,111 --> 00:20:59,578
if I told you what you wanted to know
about the Russian Air Force?

227
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,579
Don't you think
I have a sense of honor?

228
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,125
Are you referring to your
honor as a Soviet soldier?

229
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,307
What else do you think
I'm talking about?

230
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,152
What's so funny about that?

231
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,120
It's very refreshing to hear
a commie talk about honor.

232
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,450
I honor my country above everything.

233
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:22,720
Does that mean you can have no honor,
no love, no respect for anything else?

234
00:21:22,793 --> 00:21:25,488
Precisely.
Not even for yourself?

235
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:27,154
With us, the state is everything.

236
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,489
The individual has no right
to even think of himself.

237
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:33,355
Well, if we respected your feelings in
this manner, you'd have no respect for us.

238
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:35,627
Why not?

239
00:21:35,701 --> 00:21:37,634
You'd think it was a good joke.

240
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:41,068
Sure, Americans are so simple
about this freedom thing.

241
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:45,163
They don't seem to realize they're cooking
the calf in the milk of its own mother.

242
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,503
Isn't that, uh, true?

243
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,509
I've never even thought about it
in that light.

244
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:53,204
I think you should.

245
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,609
Come in, Captain.

246
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,648
In fact, I'd advise you
to give it very careful thought.

00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:24,551
Yes, sir. If anybody's gonna get anything
out of this girl, it'll be Shannon.

250
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:27,462
Me? The most perfect case
of ambivalence I ever saw.

251
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,523
Case of what?
Ambivalence?

252
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,091
Double values.

253
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:34,362
They both like and hate each other.

254
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,166
They don't know which feeling to follow.
Wonderful confusion.

255
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:41,173
Perfect sex antagonism.
This proves it.

256
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,231
Proves what?
Yeah, proves what?

257
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,609
Look at the doodle she made.

258
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:47,035
Did you make a pass at her when
you brought her down in the C-47?

259
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:47,688
I did not!

260
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,441
Let me look at that. You mean
these doodles would show it?

261
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,412
I don't know.

262
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,471
You'd get practically
the same effect if he didn't.

263
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:56,982
That's just the way it was!
I didn't! Now, Jim...

264
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,677
And speaking of passes, sir,
she threw one at me...

265
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,015
right in my office
almost before her hands got warm.

266
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:04,179
What? Then she tried it
again in the shower.

267
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:05,846
Shower?
What shower?

268
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,855
I got one in the office.
Oh, well.

269
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:09,857
What is she doing in a shower?
Well, after she undressed...

270
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:12,392
in the bathroom, gentlemen.

271
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,087
It's all in my notes, General.
I had to search her, didn't I?

272
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:17,355
Yes, but you didn't say
anything about this shower business.

273
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:19,658
She asked me if she could take one.
What else could I do?

274
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,927
General, I think we can spare
Colonel Shannon any further details.

275
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,024
The overall picture seems
to be sufficiently corroborated.

276
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:28,331
I think we'd be fully justified
in exploiting it.

277
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:30,892
Listen, General... Don't look at me.
They're absolutely right.

278
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,866
You were made for this job.

279
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:35,801
General Black, I'm a
jet man, not a gigolo.

280
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,570
How about that job you did for us
with that German Frau?

281
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:41,667
That was an accident, not in the
line of duty. Well, this is.

282
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:44,338
I'm putting you in full charge
and holding you completely responsible.

283
00:23:44,412 --> 00:23:46,937
<i>But... I don't want this angle
to get into the records.</i>

284
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,714
So I'll leave it to you
to inform your people

285
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:50,810
and the F.B.I. You do the
same with the C.I.A.

286
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,441
Yes, sir.
But, General...

287
00:23:52,517 --> 00:23:55,041
The newspapers don't know
a thing about this girl, so watch yourself.

288
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,586
Washington wants to keep it this way.
Savvy?

289
00:23:57,654 --> 00:24:01,053
General, let's don't change the subject.
Colonel Shannon?

290
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:09,757
I can take a hint.
About face! Forward march.

291
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,419
Where ya been?
You're a day late.

292
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:56,546
Ran into some bad weather in Edmonton,
but we're all present and accounted for.

293
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,954
You're still in charge.
What's the matter?

294
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,960
Well, they couldn't get
any more out of her nibs

295
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:02,888
than we did, so they
tossed her back in my lap.

296
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:05,416
You better give the group
a couple of days rest.

297
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,428
Serves you right for not
letting me bring her down.

298
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:10,293
I wish I had.

299
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:14,988
Look, I'm gonna have to
put on an act for her,

300
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:20,332
so after we pull out, you tell that Waf
captain not to take it too seriously.

301
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:24,272
Never mind.
I'll tell her myself.

302
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:31,732
You remember Major Rexford.
Oh, yes. How do you do?

303
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:34,438
Colonel Shannon tells me
you two are going up for a flight.

304
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:36,741
I still can't believe it.
You're not serious?

305
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:39,247
Why not?

306
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:41,407
You mean I'm not going
to be confined?

307
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:44,349
From now on,
you're a guest of the air force.

308
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,612
You may go where you want
and see what you like.

309
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:49,915
<i>I was instructed to give you
the same treatment and hospitality...</i>

310
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:52,286
<i>that was given to
those other two Russian fliers,</i>

311
00:25:52,357 --> 00:25:55,256
one of whom has already
returned to Russia.

312
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,258
How do you like that?

313
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,020
Well, it's very simple.
He probably became homesick.

314
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,164
Do you stuff birds too?

315
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,494
Captain.

316
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:13,766
What does he mean,
do I stuff birds too?

317
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:17,794
Nothing.
His father was a taxidermist.

318
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,362
<i>Oh. JIM: Lieutenant?</i>

319
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,907
If you please.

320
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,670
What's this all about, Major?
I can't make head or tail of it.

321
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,306
You don't know what's behind it all?

322
00:26:33,382 --> 00:26:35,815
Mind your own business.

323
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:43,183
There's your tailpipe heat,
your fuel pressure gauge.

324
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:45,187
Here's your tachometer.

325
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:47,688
I thought this was it.
Oh, that's right.

326
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:50,350
On this type, it's on the other side.

327
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:52,449
You better have a little respect
for that red handle...

328
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:55,789
<i>unless you wanna be 75 feet
in the air without a plane.</i>

329
00:26:55,861 --> 00:27:00,593
Oh. The seat ejector.
So your father was a bird stuffer.

330
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:04,656
Is that why you took up flying?

331
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,566
You're pretty well-stuffed yourself.

332

"S" For Shannon
calling "A" For Anna.

333
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,374
This is "A" For Anna.
Go ahead.

334
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,042
Meet you over the field at 30,000.

335
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,573
All right. But why didn't you tell me
you were going to pull up like that?

336
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,916
I didn't think you could make it.

337
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:41,080
(ANNA SCOFFS)

338
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:48,751
"S" For Shannon
calling "A" For Anna.

339
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,056
Go ahead.
Where are you?

340
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,595
Can't you see me?
No!

341
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:56,426
I'm very close to you.
How close?

342
00:27:56,498 --> 00:28:00,159
Well, if these guns were loaded,
you'd be minus your rudder and one wing.

343
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:03,600
Say, where are you?

344
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:05,602
(ANNA OVER RADIO)
Right underneath you.

345
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,264
Underneath me? I don't believe it.
Why don't you take a look.

346
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,137
Hello.
(LAUGHING)

347
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,836
Not bad.
I have now shot away your other wing.

348
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:20,436
(JIM LAUGHS)
I'll never hear the last of this.

349
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,524
Lady, you sure are the Peruvian doughnuts!
I wouldn't mind having you for a wingman.

350
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:48,619
I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

351
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:52,825
Let's see if you're as good in a
tight turn. That's my specialty.

352
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:07,333
ANNA: You're fabulous. That's the
tightest turn I've ever seen.

353
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:10,569
But I'll get inside of
you just the same. How?

354
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:14,168
You can't tighten it much more
without going into a spin yourself.

355
00:29:14,245 --> 00:29:16,303
Maybe, but I'm figuring
you'll do it first.

356
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,370
ANNA:
Maybe.

357
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:33,554
<i>(ANNA SCREAMS)
You see what I mean?</i>

358
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,929
JIM:
Now the gun's on the other shoulder.

359
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,930
It's much worse than that.
What's wrong?

360
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:48,989
How far are we from the field?
Why?

361
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:52,057
I've got a flameout.
A flameout? Cut your throttle.

362
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:55,365
What's the procedure for a restart?
Slow down to 200.

363
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:59,496
Right. Now start to glide, and don't touch
anything till we get down to 15,000.

364
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:02,563
Right. Hello, Palmer Tower.
This is Colonel Shannon.

365
00:30:02,642 --> 00:30:08,236
Emergency. Stand by for a dead-stick
landing of an F-86 on the long runway.

366
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:11,608
Roger, Colonel Shannon.
Crash circuit.

367
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,944
Emergency landing, F-86.
Dead stick. Runway 6.

368

<i>(SIREN WAILING) (MAN OVER PA)

<i>Emergency landing, F-86.
Dead stick. Runway 6.</i>

371
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:29,256
What's the course to the field?
Straight ahead.

372
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:32,121
But I don't think there's a chance
for a dead-stick from here.

373
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:35,251
You can't restart your engine,
you'll have to bail out.

374
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,886
Bail out?
With the seat ejector?

375
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,691
Have you ever tried it?
Not in these trousers.

376
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:44,028
They say it's pure rugged,
so you'd better try to get an air start.

377
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,534
I'm unlucky. I've never been able
to get one yet.

378
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:52,162
Now, just take it easy. You've only enough
juice in that battery for one stab at it.

379
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,864
Is your compressor turning over?

380
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:58,374
Yes. It's windmilling about 17%.
That's fine.

381
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,773
We're almost down to 15,000.

382
00:31:00,843 --> 00:31:03,811
Have you got your emergency
fuel switch on? Yes.

383
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:06,936
Now turn on your ignition boost
and crack your throttle.

384
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,947
What next?
Say a prayer.

385
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:11,141
I don't believe in that nonsense.

386
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:14,343
Then you'd better quit flying jets.
Why?

387
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:18,284
Never mind.
I'll say one for you.

388
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:21,288
Maybe you should say another one.
Why?

389
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:23,345
The temperature's beginning
to rise in my tailpipe.

390
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:27,949
You probably only have two burners going.
Open your throttle another crack.

391
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:34,722
They're all burning now. Should
I try full power? Go ahead.

392
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,900
You're all right.
Pour on the coal and head for home!

393
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:54,072
Hey, that turn of yours...
I wish you'd show me how to do it.

394
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:56,371
You can show me a few things too.

395
00:31:56,443 --> 00:32:01,436
I don't think so.
You're the best I ever saw.

396
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:05,379
Then how come you got underneath me?
Just a trick.

397
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,382
How'd you do it?

398
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,214
I'll tell you if you'll show me how
to do that tight turn. I can't.

399
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:14,617
Why not?
It was revealed to me in a dream.

400
00:32:14,688 --> 00:32:16,746
Oh.

401
00:32:41,171 --> 00:32:44,867
The way she flies that F-86,
the Soviets must have an equivalent type.

402
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,907
She sure is
fully operational with it.

403
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:51,671
I don't think their battery system
or burners are as good as ours. Why?

404
00:32:51,744 --> 00:32:55,041
When she had the flameout, she said
she'd never been able to relight one.

405
00:32:55,112 --> 00:32:57,671
But they have some tactics
we oughta study.

406
00:32:57,747 --> 00:33:00,510
You mean the way she gets inside of you
on that loop? Couldn't get rid of her.

407
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:05,279
She must be pretty good. Only thing I
could beat her at was a tight turn.

408
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,911
If we'd have been using bullets
instead of film,

409
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:11,114
I'd have been cold meat
long before that.

410
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,179
Well, that's fine, Jim.

411
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:18,889
<i>What are you gonna try her on next?</i>

412
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,359
She seems to be interested
in our night interceptions.

413
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:23,361
Think we oughta
give her a whirl at it?

414
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,419
I don't see why not.

415
00:33:25,497 --> 00:33:28,727
Washington wants us to find out
what interests her most,

416
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,994
which, by all processes of deduction,
should give them some idea...

417
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,126
of the things the Russians haven't got.

418
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:34,977
Go ahead.

419
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,364
That means she'll get a peek
at some of our new stuff.

420
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:40,496
We'll bring out
an old night fighter from Dayton.

421
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,166
We'll also set up
our old method of interception.

422
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,615
Then all she'll get out
of it's a ride. How

423
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,074
are you progressing on
the sentimental side?

424
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:51,874
I'm not rushing it, Rivers.
Why not, Colonel?

425
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,404
She hasn't given me a chance, Major.

426
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,780
Maybe I was imagining things
up in Alaska.

427
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,097
Shannon to Pilot.
Push in the channel "C" button.

428
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:40,608
That'll put us
on fighter control frequency.

429
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:45,977
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.
I'm airborne.

430
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:50,175
Broken clouds and a full moon.
Request instructions. Over.

431
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,773
Red Dog to Shannon.
We have you.

432
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,579
Our B-36 is turning inland.

433
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:05,385
It's taking up a heading of 0-9-0.

434
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:09,893
How far out is she?
I'd say about 140 miles.

435
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:12,428
B-36 track, she's moved to...

440

Use full power.

441
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,839
I wanna ask you something first.
(OVER RADIO). Go ahead

442
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:37,035
Is this a collision course I'm flying?

443
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,839
JIM: Yes. Haven't you
ever flown one? Yes.

444
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:44,574
But for a dry run in stuff like this, well,
at jet speed, I think it's too dangerous.

445
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:47,810
Get on course. Let the fighter
control do the worrying.

446
00:35:47,883 --> 00:35:50,442
Why should they worry,
sitting on the ground?

447
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:53,315
If you've got cold feet, I'll be glad
to take over the controls.

448
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,911
No, thanks.
I'll feel safer doing it myself.

449
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:00,219
Then get on the course and
get off the air. I'm on it.

450
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:12,729
<i>MAN 1: It's okay now.
MAN 2: Yeah, he's right on the button.</i>

451
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,731
We'd better warn Shannon.

452
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,097
He should pick it up
on his scope pretty quick.

453
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,829
In exactly 35 seconds.

454
00:36:20,903 --> 00:36:23,961
Red Dog to Shannon.
Go ahead, Red Dog.

455
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,336
Watch your scope
very closely now.

456
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,340
You should be able
to blossom any second.

457
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:31,968
Shannon to Red Dog. Okay.

458
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,974
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.

459
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:42,710
Target contacted.

460
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,711
Ah! Only a fifth of a second off.

461
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:48,980
I'll have to give you some homework.

462
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:51,851
Roger, Shannon.
Understand you have target.

463
00:36:51,922 --> 00:36:54,651
It's all yours.
Red Dog listening. Out.

464
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:57,213
Shannon to Pilot.
We're on our own now.

465
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:01,920
The B-36 is a little to our left
about seven miles ahead of us.

466
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:05,520
<i>Turn left 10 degrees.
Range. Six and a half miles.</i>

467
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,895
Increase speed 3-0 miles.

468
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:10,593
ANNA:
Right.

469
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:20,069
Now, watch your scope and tell me when you
see a pip on it. That is your target.

470
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:30,341
<i>ANNA:
I see one.</i>

471
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,209
No-Yes, yes, I see it!

472
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,839
JIM: Now center it on your
crosshairs and hold it there.

473
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:38,247
When the image spreads to those other
lines, you're in range to shoot.

474
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:44,380
<i>The image has now reached the outer lines.
How should I attack? Astern?</i>

475
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:48,253
JIM: No, no. From astern, they'd
shoot you down. Pull up parallel.

476
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:52,382
<i>MAN:
Hey, Paul, take a look at this, will you?</i>

477
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:58,561
I think 4-7-9's getting
a little too close for comfort.

478
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,723
<i>PAUL:
Yeah! Red Dog to Shannon.</i>

479
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:04,994
<i>What are you doing? You're supposed
to intercept, not coincide.</i>

480
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,193
JIM: Drop your dive brakes.
You're right on top of it!

481
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,430
ANNA: I saw it. JIM: Then
why don't you break it off?

482
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,266
Well, why should I?
I was watching it on my scope.

483
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,573
The pips have coincided.
I hope they haven't.

484
00:38:18,642 --> 00:38:21,871
Boy, if they haven't,
they must be riding piggyback.

485
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,973
Now look. They're separated again.

486
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:34,813
I hope those aren't just pieces of them.
No, they'd be off there by now.

487
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:38,285
Hello, Red Dog. Shannon here.

488
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:42,151
I'm sitting on the wing off that B-36.
Any further instructions?

489
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:46,658
Red Dog to Shannon. Brother, you
had us sittin' on something too.

490
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:50,626
Steer 2-3-0 degrees for base.
Listening out.

491
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:53,218
JIM:
Ah, roger.

492
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:56,628
Shannon to Target.
Good night, mama.

493
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,892
You look pretty good in there.

494
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:03,094
MAN: Good night, baby. You did
quite a bit of lookin' yourself.

495
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,899
How do you like it?
Like what?

496
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:18,603
Our night interception routine.
Oh, you Americans.

497
00:39:18,678 --> 00:39:20,612
What's the matter with us?

498
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:23,476
You are utterly antagonistic to any
form of regimentation on the ground,

499
00:39:23,547 --> 00:39:26,538
but in the air, you accept it
in the most abject manner.

500
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,742
Well, you've got to admit
it works pretty good.

501
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:33,048
Well, that's what puzzles me.
I can't understand it.

502
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,417
What'll you give me if I tell ya?

503
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:38,979
Give you?
What do you want?

504
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:41,217
Is this too much?

505
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:47,355
That's a habit with you.
What?

506
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,419
Trying to get something for nothing.

507
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:53,488
I believe in looking at
merchandise before I pay for it.

508
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,659
So do I. I'd really like to
know about these maneuvers.

509
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:59,634
These, or those?

510
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:02,000
Those.

511
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:05,767
Well, I warn ya, I won't come through
unless you improve on that last sample.

512
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,668
Very well.

513
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:36,749
How was that?
Very much better.

514
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:39,987
Why?
It was a perfect example of teamwork.

515
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,460
Just apply it to that interception routine,
and you've got the answer.

516
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,463
Teamwork?

517
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,657
Everybody works together.

518
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:50,791
Like the first time I kissed ya,
you didn't do your part.

519
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:53,891
So we didn't get anywhere.
In other words,

520
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,368
you believe the individual
must sacrifice his personal feelings...

521
00:40:57,437 --> 00:41:00,064
and work with somebody else
for the benefit of the whole enterprise?

522
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:02,663
That's right. Mass production.
I see.

523
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,674
The idea's purely capitalistic.

524
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:08,177
No wonder every loyal Russian
instinctively rejects it.

525
00:41:08,244 --> 00:41:10,871
I give up. Come on.

526
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:14,403
Get in, you silly Siberian cupcake.

527
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,449
Cupcake? What does that mean?

528
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,507
If the P.X. Is still open,
I'll buy you a couple.

529
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:23,280
First, it's baloney.
Then it's stuffed birds.

530
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:25,445
And now, it's cupcake.

531
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,258
ANNA:
Why are you letting down?

532
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:37,921
Well, Washington said you could go
where you want and see what you like.

533
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,986
And this, I think, you'll like.

534
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:43,930
Hello, Palm Springs Tower.
This is Air ForceJet 1-9-0.

535
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:47,490
This is Palm Springs Tower.
Go ahead, 1 -Niner-0.

536
00:41:47,568 --> 00:41:51,936
JIM: Ten miles west. Request landing
instructions for two F-86's.

537
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:55,166
Roger, 1 -Niner-0.
Runway 2-4.

538
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,230
Wind: Northwest 1-4.

539
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:00,764
Altimeter: Two-niner-niner-seven.
Call on initial.

540
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:03,402
JIM:
Ah, roger.

541
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,615
ANNA:
Hey, what was that?

542
00:42:11,683 --> 00:42:13,946
JIM:
I'll show you sometime.

543
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:40,226
Capitalism has certain
dangerous advantages.

544
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:43,825
That's one thing we have in common
with the Soviet. What's that?

545
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:47,462
We both believe in uplifting
the, uh, masses.

546
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:50,164
Yes, but that's not true in
all instances. Of course.

547
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,173
There are some who don't require.

548
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:03,803
So that's the shape you're in.
Freddie!

549
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:09,148
Was he making fun of me?
On the contrary.

550
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:11,616
He was paying you
the highest compliment in his power.

551
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:13,619
You mean, he liked me?

552
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:17,818
That's strange.
By Russian standards of beauty,

553
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,289
I'm considered only fair.

554
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:23,383
They prefer a more robust type.
Mm-hmm.

555
00:43:23,459 --> 00:43:26,256
The more, the merrier.

556
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:28,261
Then you agree with my countrymen?

557
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:30,762
No, I can't say that I do.

558
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:34,390
I'm very much interested in your
point of view, so please, be frank.

559
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:37,161
Tell me exactly what you think.
I can't.

560
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:41,896
Why not?
I haven't sufficient flow of speech.

561
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,665
Well, that sounds very nice.

562
00:43:44,739 --> 00:43:46,729
Is it?

563
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:50,673
Well, it's, uh,
the best I can do at the moment.

564
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:53,801
In other words,
I'm attractive to you...

565
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:55,845
in every way except politically?

566
00:43:55,912 --> 00:44:01,473
That's about it.
I hate your insides, and vice versa.

567
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:04,948
Which is more important to you?
It's a toss-up.

568
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,919
Can't make up my mind.

569
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:12,580
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why?

570
00:44:14,423 --> 00:44:16,822
'Cause I feel exactly
the same way about you.

571
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:21,554
You do?
That's why I spoke to you about it.

572
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:25,995
Have you any solution? The more I
think about it, the worse it gets.

573
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,397
I have the same trouble.
One minute I wanna kill you,

574
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:35,596
and the next minute
I want to kiss you and...

575
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:39,435
kiss you and...
kiss you.

576
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:42,769
Same here.
What are we gonna do about it?

577
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,171
I don't know.
I've never met anyone before...

578
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:47,607
who aroused and revolted me
in the same proportion.

579
00:44:47,677 --> 00:44:50,304
I'm very confused.
Something else I can do for you?

580
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:52,902
Maybe you could advise us.
What would you do if you knew a man...

581
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,971
Try this on, Lieutenant.

582
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:59,847
What is the price of this coverall
and golden heliotrope?

583
00:45:06,688 --> 00:45:09,623
This hat is perfectly silly,
and I adore it.

584
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:11,851
I wish you'd have bought the red one.
I liked it better.

585
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:15,792
I like this one. Well, you're wearing
it too far back on your head.

586
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,192
That's the way I like it.
Which one is my bedroom?

587
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,253
Take your pick.

588
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:30,959
(SQUEALS)

589
00:45:34,872 --> 00:45:38,931
They're both exactly the same.
I like this one.

590
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:41,134
But, uh...
But what?

591
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:43,176
Who's gonna use this room?

592
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:45,437
Both of us.

593
00:45:45,512 --> 00:45:47,445
Really?

594
00:45:47,513 --> 00:45:50,106
Accommodations in Palm Springs
are very scarce.

595
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:53,911
This is all they had.
Anyway, I'm responsible for you.

596
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,646
Well, naturally,
but I was thinking about the waste.

597
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,743
What waste?
All this lovely space.

598
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,787
In Russia, they'd put at least
three families in it.

599
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:05,483
Four by dividing the room with a curtain.
Two on that side, two on this side.

600
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:09,919
Well, why don't you build
more houses?

601
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:12,154
Jets and bombers
are more important just now.

602
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,162
I agree with you.
You do?

603
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,996
What's the use of building
houses if somebody's

604
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:17,459
gonna blow 'em off the map?
Of course.

605
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:21,762
We go right on spending billions for
housing, and only millions for planes.

606
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:26,531
It's awful.
I think you're absolutely right.

607
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:32,896
But, uh...

608
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,843
But, uh...

609
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:43,368
But...

610
00:46:47,649 --> 00:46:49,742
But what?

611
00:46:49,818 --> 00:46:53,752
You realize that you and I are
of the same mind about this matter?

612
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,551
Say, that's right.

613
00:46:58,623 --> 00:47:00,783

Oh, it's you. What are you trying to do,

618
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:27,973
Well, I didn't think you were in.
Well, then what'd you knock for?

Well, I...
Oh, hello, Georgie.

Fine. Uh...

621

Major Rexford's wife, Georgie.

You told me to give

What's that? That smile of yours.
Where have you been keeping it?

I'm happy tonight.

628

Why don't you look where you're going? I
haven't got eyes on the back of my head.

629
00:48:08,032 --> 00:48:12,524
Major Rexford and his wife
dance very well together, don't they?

630
00:48:13,802 --> 00:48:16,497
I wish I could say the same for us.

631
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:19,834
What am I doing that's wrong?
You're holding me too tight.

632
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:25,497
Too tight?
I can hardly breathe.

633
00:48:25,575 --> 00:48:29,704
You're not serious?
I was never more serious in my life.

634
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:37,913
Is that better?
What do you think?

635
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:40,075
I think it's divine.

636

What's your first name?

637
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,544
Jim.

Jim and Anna.

639
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,782
Anna and Jim.

640
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,970
Are you married?

641
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:20,374
That's good.

642
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,476
Are you?

643
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:30,648
Ever been in love?

644
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,979
Not in your sense of the word.

645
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,279
Oh.

646
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:39,184
So you feel about love...

647
00:49:39,254 --> 00:49:42,347
the same way you feel about religion?

648
00:49:42,422 --> 00:49:45,720
That's right.
Both are dangerous narcotics.

649
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:48,486
They make individuals forget
their duty to the state.

650
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,651
How's that?

651
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:53,752
Well, under the influence
of love or religion,

652
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:57,229
individuals are unable to sacrifice
one another for the national good.

653
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:59,992
Now, isn't that just too bad?

654
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:02,659
Why?

655
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,126
You were made for it.

656
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:11,636
Made for what?
Love.

657
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,800
I don't see the connection.

658
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:25,043
Why do you suppose
you're so beautiful?

659
00:50:25,115 --> 00:50:29,948
Purely a biological fallacy which makes
our necessities appear pleasurable to us,

660
00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:31,950
like eating, drinking...

661
00:50:32,018 --> 00:50:35,783
Then you do admit
that love is a necessity.

662
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:38,822
I admit that passion is.

663
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,222
What's the difference?

664
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,516
Well, it's pretty hard to explain.

665
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:48,661
Why?

666
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,725
I haven't sufficient flow of speech.

667
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:58,594
Have you had many of them?

668
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:00,396
Many what?

669
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:04,938
Women?

670
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:08,273
Well, I don't know.

671
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:16,440
These girls, were they
as beautiful to you as I am?

672
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:19,847
No.

673
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,782
Not one?

674
00:51:25,351 --> 00:51:27,341
Not lately.

<i>Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.</i>

676
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,588
What about you?

677
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:39,115
I'm not ignorant of passion, but I've never
had such a feeling for a man before.

678
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:42,456
I've never been so stirred by a kiss.
I can't even stop thinking about it.

679
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:46,560
You're not the only one.

680
00:51:46,631 --> 00:51:51,532
We, uh, can't do it here,
of course.

681
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,466
No.
But it won't hurt to talk about it.

682
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:58,163
No.
It's almost as nice.

683
00:51:58,238 --> 00:52:00,171
Well, go ahead.

684
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:05,535
Do you close your eyes
when you do it?

685
00:52:05,609 --> 00:52:07,667
Don't you?

686
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:10,404
Well, you know what it means
when you don't?

687
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:13,241
You're thinking of someone else.

688
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,910
What kind do you like best?

689
00:52:16,982 --> 00:52:20,473
The slow, sweet ones like this?

690

anything more divine?

692
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:35,420
Well, we're gonna have one
just like it in a few minutes.

693
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:38,655
Isn't this it? You mean they have
more than one like this? Sure.

694
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:41,287
That's all they serve here.

695
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:47,289
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?

696
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:49,494
We're lost.
Who's lost?

697
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:54,470
How can Russia compete
with such propaganda?

698
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,563
Good night. I had such a lovely time.
So did we.

699
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:01,108
See you tomorrow, Rex.
Oh, no, you won't.

700
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:03,109
Why not? We've gotta
drive back to the field.

701
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:05,111
What's the rush?
We couldn't find a room.

702
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:07,202
The town's jammed.
Oh, that's too bad.

703
00:53:07,279 --> 00:53:09,645
What about our sitting room?
Well, what about it?

704
00:53:09,715 --> 00:53:12,181
Why couldn't they use that?
Oh, we wouldn't wanna bother you.

705
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,911
I should say not. Bother? Why would
it bother us? The room is empty.

706
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,849
And the couch is one of
those wonderful American

707
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,476
inventions that can
be turned into a bed.

708
00:53:19,554 --> 00:53:22,522
Isn't it, Jim?
Yeah. Come on.

709
00:53:27,692 --> 00:53:31,649
Sorry, folks. We haven't got a thing.
All filled up. Not a place I could put you.

710
00:53:31,728 --> 00:53:33,957
Well, looks like
we have to go back to I.A.

711
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:37,986
But, honey, I'm just dead.
Let's try someplace else, huh?

712
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:41,829
This is Major Rexford and his wife.
They're gonna use my sitting room tonight.

713
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,867
Care to register, Major?
With pleasure.

Oh. Mary Lou Simpson.

Why, yes!

Jim? Jim,
this is Mr. And Mrs. Simpson.

717
00:53:53,774 --> 00:53:55,708
How do you do?
They can use my room.

718
00:53:55,776 --> 00:53:57,709
Huh?
Go on and register.

719
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,803
Well, wait a minute.
Where are you gonna sleep?

720
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:04,278
Well, there are two beds in your
room, aren't there? Yes, but...

721
00:54:04,347 --> 00:54:06,871
You can't sleep in both of them.
Well, I know, but...

722
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:09,215
Don't worry. I'm used to it.
Nobody in Russia

723
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,213
has any privacy. But
how are you gonna...

724
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:14,879
It's very simple.
I merely undress in the bathroom.

725
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,856
Haven't you got that bed fixed yet?

726
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:29,058
Look, honey. This is the swellest
nightgown I've ever seen.

727
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,461
<i>Just as light as a spider's web.</i>

728
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:35,396
Jim picked it out for me. Honey,
the colonel picked it out for her.

729
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,404
Well, what are you
looking at me for?

730
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:47,337
She asked me which one I felt was the
nicest, and I told her. That's all.

731
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:49,966
Jim, I understand perfectly.
So do I.

732
00:54:50,043 --> 00:54:53,010
I do too. Well, who asked you?
Let's get this thing fixed.

733
00:54:53,077 --> 00:54:55,772
That's easy.
I've handled beds like this before.

<i>Here we go again.

Oh, hello, General.
Yes, she's here.

What did you say, sir?

738
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:17,090
Yes, sir. I understand.

739
00:55:17,158 --> 00:55:21,321
It's, uh, five after 3:00.
We'll leave right away.

Yes, sir. Good-bye, sir.

Looks like you're gonna have a bedroom to
yourself after all. Well, what happened?

742
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:33,523
I gotta take Anna back to Palmer Field.
Something wrong?

743
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,694
I'll say.
They're gonna deport her.

744
00:55:57,883 --> 00:56:00,714
"A" For Anna
calling "S" For Shannon.

745
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,453
Go ahead, Anna.

746
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,478
I guess this is the last time
we'll be flying together.

747
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:15,690
I was just thinking the same thing.

748
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:39,840
I thought Palmer Field was that way.

749
00:56:39,907 --> 00:56:43,934
SHANNON: It still is. Then why
did you change your course?

750
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,773
I think you'd be better off
if we go this way.

751
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:51,543
What are you going to do? I'm not
gonna talk about it on the air.

752
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:01,745
I thought Palm Springs was hot,
but this place is simply fantastic.

753
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:06,689
Yuma's always like this. It won't be bad
after the air conditioning gets to work.

754
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:09,817
You think that clerk'll be able
to locate the justice of peace?

755
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,588
Sure. The judge gives 24-hour service.

756
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:15,891
So does the license clerk. You folks
are as good as married right now.

757
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:20,399
Here ya are. That's all right, sir.
I'm an old air-force man myself.

758
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,396
Is that why you brought me here?
To get married?

759
00:57:26,469 --> 00:57:30,404
Well, they can't deport
the wife of an American citizen.

760
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,769
But you'll get into trouble
if you marry me.

761
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:35,831
Sure, I will.

762
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:40,238
Plenty of trouble.

763
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:50,547
Wait'll I take a shower, Jim.
I'm soaking wet.

764
00:57:50,618 --> 00:57:52,608
So am I.

765
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:57,879
What will they do to you?
I don't know.

766
00:57:57,955 --> 00:58:02,049
Probably kick me out of the service.
Is that all?

767
00:58:02,124 --> 00:58:04,524
Isn't that enough?

768
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:08,357
You love your air force
a great deal, don't you, Jim?

769
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:10,454
Well, I've been in it
quite a while, you know.

770
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,054
Then why are you doing this?
Wouldn't you do the same for me?

771
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:14,723
No.
You wouldn't?

772
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,823
Of course not.

773
00:58:28,874 --> 00:58:32,638
ANNA: Was that better?
You're still going too high.

774
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,699
Watch this.

775
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:40,707
ANNA:
I see.

776
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:57,758
ANNA:
How was that?

777
00:58:57,825 --> 00:59:00,258
SHANNON:
Well, now you got it!

778
00:59:14,936 --> 00:59:18,893
SHANNON: Hello, Palmer Tower,

779
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,904
Gear down and in the green.

<i>You are number one to land.
I have a message for you.</i>

<i>General Black requests that
you report to his office at once.</i>

784
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,879
Ah, roger.

785
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:45,649
Yesterday morning at 3:00, I told you to
start back here immediately! Yes, sir.

786
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,847
You're just about 30 hours overdue.
Yes, sir.

787
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:50,412
Where have you been all this time? I've
been looking all over the country for you!

788
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:53,050
Yuma, sir. Yuma? What
did you go there for?

789
00:59:53,124 --> 00:59:55,183
To get married.
Married?

790
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,489
You married that Russian girl?
That's right.

791
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,925
You married that girl after I told you
she was gonna be deported?

792
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,622
Yes, sir.
That's why I did it.

793
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:06,154
Will that make any difference? Not
after two or three years of red tape.

794
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:10,100
An alien cannot be deported if it works
a hardship on an American citizen.

795
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:11,913
Jim Shannon, do you realize
you've cooked your

796
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:13,763
whole career just to get
this girl out of a jam?

797
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,533
Yes, sir, I thought about that.
I've been thinking a lot about it.

798
01:00:17,608 --> 01:00:19,437
Apparently, you're in love with her.

799
01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:22,032
What else does it look like?

800
01:00:22,109 --> 01:00:24,338
Well, I'm sorry, Jim,
very sorry,

801
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,570
but I think I've got
a pretty fast cure for it.

802
01:00:26,645 --> 01:00:28,805
Cure? I don't know
that I wanna be cured.

803
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,474
As your wife, she can't
be deported for some time.

804
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:33,846
That part you've accomplished.
But that's only peanuts.

805
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:36,975
Now I'll tell you the real jam you're in.
You're married to a Soviet agent.

806
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,747
Yes, sir, one of their best.
What?

807
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:45,017
I understand she drove
the British Intelligence absolutely nuts.

808
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:47,353
Mister, you'll have to prove this to me.

809
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:49,550
That I think I can do.

810

Yeah.
Was it worse than you thought?

01:02:09,441 --> 01:02:13,536
Yeah.
What are they going to do to you?

820
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:15,873
I don't know yet.

821

They haven't decided.

Things are flying around in my head
like feathers in a bag.

840

Are you going to kill me?
I don't know.

841
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:33,913
Whatever happens, I wish you'd
remember one thing. What's that?

842
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:36,483
I've hated myself for doing this to you.
You mean you hated being a spy?

843
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:38,721
I'm not ashamed of that.
Then what are you talkin' about?

844
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:40,886
Marrying you.
I tried to keep you from doing it.

845
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:43,692
Is that all that's worrying you?
Yes.

846
01:03:43,765 --> 01:03:46,324
Well, I got somethin'

Oh, Jim.

851
01:03:57,406 --> 01:04:00,772

01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,579
I've been a little busy
the last few days.

857

Let's catch another drink.
By all means.

Shall we eat something?
Why, are you hungry?

859
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:32,217
Not particularly. But I always heard
that condemned criminals...

860
01:04:32,294 --> 01:04:34,760
eat a hearty meal
the night before they're hanged.

861
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,228
Yeah, but there's no bar
at the jail.

862
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:39,259
If they could have all
they want to drink, I'll

863
01:04:39,274 --> 01:04:41,129
bet they wouldn't worry
much about the food.

864
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:43,793
What'll we have?
Go for some more champagne?

865

Mmm! Like we did last night?
Yeah.

Hello, Charlie. Haven't seen you
for a week or two, Colonel.

Where have you been? We've been
doing our drinking at home.

871
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,585
Two Tom Collins. And instead of
club soda, make it champagne.

872
01:05:13,652 --> 01:05:15,586
Oh, no wonder you stayed home.

873
01:05:17,221 --> 01:05:19,245
That was no dream.

874
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:21,313
It wasn't?

875
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,417
Didn't I have it on when I woke up?

876
01:05:25,493 --> 01:05:29,825
When I came to, all you had on
was... my bathrobe.

877
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:32,830
Oh, yes.

878
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:37,524
I put that on for the milkman.

Now, let's see.

01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,061
When was the last time I wore it?

881
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:50,131
I seem to remember taking it out
of a hatbox.

882
01:05:54,944 --> 01:05:58,605
Say, that was in Yuma.

883

Mmm, Yuma.

884
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:07,446
I know where it is.

885
01:06:13,222 --> 01:06:15,155
Where are you going?

886
01:06:15,223 --> 01:06:17,282
I washed it when we got back here, and it's
been hanging out on the line ever since...

887
01:06:17,357 --> 01:06:19,291
along with the rest
of my nice underwear.

888

Oh, if anybody's taken it
Don't worry. Nobody's gonna bother it.

889
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:24,686
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.

890
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:27,389
And what's the difference?
I can always buy you another one.

01:06:57,849 --> 01:06:59,783
Certainly.

903
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,007
Please hurry.

904
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:08,785
Do you have a call for me, Henry?
Yes, sir.

905
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:11,050
You can take it in the office.

906
01:07:16,594 --> 01:07:18,527
Well, Jim.
General.

907
01:07:18,595 --> 01:07:20,529
We got our okay from Washington.
Swell.

908
01:07:20,596 --> 01:07:23,155
But I don't like this business.
I never have. Why?

909
01:07:23,231 --> 01:07:25,461
I don't want you
to stick your neck in a noose.

910
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:27,850
Oh, I'll be all right. I
don't see how anything

911
01:07:27,866 --> 01:07:30,297
can go wrong the way we've
got things worked out.

912
01:07:30,369 --> 01:07:32,131
Maybe.

913
01:07:32,203 --> 01:07:34,932
But I want you to know, if you have any
doubts, it isn't too late to say so.

914
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:38,439
Do you understand? That's why
I didn't bring Rivers and Sinclair along.

915
01:07:38,507 --> 01:07:41,634
You can back out right now.
I'll take the bump. Be glad to.

916
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:44,176
Thanks, General,
but I wouldn't miss this for anything.

917
01:07:44,244 --> 01:07:47,302
No kidding.
So long, sir.

918
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:49,777
Thanks, Rex.
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

919
01:07:49,847 --> 01:07:52,144
I don't mind babysitting
this kind of a baby.

920
01:07:52,215 --> 01:07:54,341
Any news?

921
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:57,543
Yeah.

922
01:07:57,619 --> 01:08:00,212
See ya later.
Okay.

923
01:08:00,287 --> 01:08:02,220
Is this it?

924
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:04,778
Have they finally decided
what they're going to do to us?

925
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:07,483
Yes.
What about you?

926
01:08:07,557 --> 01:08:10,583
They're gonna let me off
with a reprimand.

927
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:14,025
Is that all?
Oh, that's fantastic.

928
01:08:14,095 --> 01:08:16,426
They don't suspect you
of any complicity?

929
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:18,463
Why should they?

930
01:08:18,532 --> 01:08:21,328
This is really an amazing country.

931
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,333
Do you know what
they'd do to you in Russia?

932
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,527
They'd either shoot you
or send you to the uranium mines.

933
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,263
Oh, Jim, I'm so happy for you.

934
01:08:34,774 --> 01:08:36,707
All right. Tell me.

935
01:08:36,776 --> 01:08:39,504
As good as it is for me,
it's that bad for you.

936
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:41,544
Go on.

937
01:08:41,611 --> 01:08:43,909
Looks like 15 years
in the penitentiary...

938
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:46,105
the way they're tightening up
on you commies.

939
01:08:46,181 --> 01:08:48,911
Five years. That's the worst they
can do to me, and a $10,000 fine.

940
01:08:48,983 --> 01:08:52,611
Put 10 years on top of that
for transmitting stolen information...

941
01:08:52,686 --> 01:08:54,618
and another $10,000 fine.

942
01:08:54,686 --> 01:08:59,621
Why? Well, they got that
report you tried to send out.

943
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,987
Fifteen years?

944
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,218
I'll be an old woman
by the time I get out.

945
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:11,119
What about us?
Where will you be?

946
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:13,255
I was thinking the same thing.

947
01:09:13,331 --> 01:09:15,958
I've never had too much fear of death,

948
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:20,525
but somehow this seems
more frightening.

949
01:09:20,602 --> 01:09:22,762
Fifteen years!

950
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:24,736
I wouldn't expect you
to wait that long.

951
01:09:24,804 --> 01:09:26,738
It wouldn't do any good if I did.

952
01:09:26,806 --> 01:09:29,501
They'll deport you
when you've done your time.

953
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:34,134
When are they going to arrest me?
I don't know.

954
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:38,203
Maybe not till after the dance.
It usually breaks up around 2:00 or 3:00.

955
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,270
Five hours.

956
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:44,615
That's a long time.

957
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:48,976
You gonna try and make a break for it?
Do you think there's a chance?

958
01:09:49,053 --> 01:09:51,316
Well, there's only two of those men
from the F.B.I.

959
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:54,719
One of'em's probably out in front,
and one out in back.

960
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,314
Now, the ladies' room
is on the east side.

961
01:09:57,391 --> 01:10:00,257
If you were to drop out a window...
It's no use.

962
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:03,385
I couldn't get out of this field. It's
too well-guarded. How do you know?

963
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:07,294
I tried it night before last
after you were asleep.

964
01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:12,458
Well, how'd you get by those F.B.I. Men
that were planted around our house?

965
01:10:12,533 --> 01:10:16,127
I've had a lot of experience
in that sort of work.

966
01:10:16,202 --> 01:10:21,899
And the only way you can get out of
this field is to have a gate pass.

967
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:23,964
I'm thinking of an easier way.

968
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,564
What's that?
I could take you out by plane.

969
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:30,099
Are you insane?
Haven't I got you in enough trouble?

970
01:10:30,178 --> 01:10:32,975
I won't get in any trouble over this.
Why not?

971
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:37,845
If we leave now, we'll probably be in
Siberia before this dance breaks up.

972
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:39,746
Siberia?

973
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:43,182
Let's go on in and finish our drinks.

974
01:10:56,927 --> 01:10:59,622
First call for French 75's
I've had in a long time.

975
01:10:59,695 --> 01:11:02,389
They're all right
if you like a direct hit.

976
01:11:04,332 --> 01:11:07,027
Well, here's one for the road.

977
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:11,233
Are you serious?

978
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:13,236
What else could I do?

979
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:17,363
I don't think I'd be very happy
without you.

980
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:29,868
They have anything like this
in Russia?

981
01:11:29,947 --> 01:11:32,938
We can get the champagne.
I don't know about the gin.

982
01:11:33,016 --> 01:11:35,279
I can make 'em with vodka.

983
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:36,492
Are they as good?

984
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:39,614
All right if you don't
mind the Russian breath.

985
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,517
What's that?

986
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:44,181
Knocks everything over within 15 feet.

987
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:47,349
(LAUGHS, COUGHING)

988
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:54,288
<i>(BIG BAND RESUMES)</i>

989
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:26,702
(ENGINE POWERING UP)

990
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:57,589
Where ya been?
I went back to the house.

991
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,691
Back to the house?
What for?

992
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:02,167
You think I'm gonna go back
to Russia without that nightgown?

993
01:13:02,235 --> 01:13:04,225
Oh!

994
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:33,982
Well, he's off.

995
01:13:34,055 --> 01:13:37,581
Godspeed.
Amen.

996
01:13:48,998 --> 01:13:52,125
What is it, Sergeant? Oh, sir.
I'm worried about this F-94.

997
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,358
Number 479. It took off
from here about a half

998
01:13:54,373 --> 01:13:56,362
hour ago. Colonel Shannon?
What about him?

999
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:59,562
<i>Well, it looks like he's heading
for Siberia instead of Palmer Field.</i>

1000
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:01,604
Siberia?

1001
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:10,340
Hello, Air ForceJet 479.
This is Fighter Control.

1002
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:12,901
Fighter Control calling
Colonel Shannon in 479.

1003
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:17,039
This is Colonel Shannon in 479.
Go ahead, Freddie.

1004
01:14:17,116 --> 01:14:19,378
Colonel Shannon,
do you know where you're going?

1005
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:22,315
According to our radar,
you're headed west over the Bering Sea.

1006
01:14:22,386 --> 01:14:24,682
Yes, I know where I'm going.

1007
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:26,584
So long, Freddie.

1008
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:31,582
He says he knows where he's going.

1009
01:14:31,657 --> 01:14:33,782
Did you hear that, Anna?

1010
01:14:33,858 --> 01:14:36,156
Looks like the soup has hit the fan.

1011
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:38,854
I'm surprised we got this far
before they found out.

1012
01:14:38,928 --> 01:14:42,259
Every jet outfit in Alaska
is probably scrambling to head us off.

1013
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:46,992
ANNA: They'll never catch us. I'm
more afraid of our jets. Why?

1014
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,761
You better stop dropping down a little.
What for?

1015
01:14:49,834 --> 01:14:52,051
At this altitude, you'll
be showing up on the

1016
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:54,202
Soviet radar net in
less than five minutes.

1017
01:14:54,271 --> 01:14:58,171
What about it? Your radio
transmitter's on the wrong frequency.

1018
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,299
So I can't identify myself
if they intercept us.

1019
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:04,775
They won't shoot if we lower our
landing gear. Oh, yes, they will.

1020
01:15:04,844 --> 01:15:07,470
Okay, I'll go down on the deck.

1021
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,732
I have one of my own.

1022
01:15:49,804 --> 01:15:53,261
What am I saying?
Refusing an American cigarette.

1023
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:59,508
Why did you let him
destroy that plane?

1024
01:15:59,577 --> 01:16:01,401
If he hadn't, our fighter
and the flak would.

1025
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:02,976
Why didn't you shoot
our fighter down?

1026
01:16:03,045 --> 01:16:07,173
I told Shannon to, but he said
he didn't come over here to start a war.

1027
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:09,875
War? What war?
That's idiotic.

1028
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:13,076
Why didn't you shoot Shannon? I didn't
have anything to shoot him with.

1029
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,916
Nonsense. You have been taught
to kill without weapons.

1030
01:16:16,987 --> 01:16:19,352
I thought of that.
Then why didn't you do it?

1031
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:25,558
I couldn't make up my mind at the moment
which was the most valuable to us...

1032
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:27,559
the plane or my husband.

1033
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:29,992
Is that why you decided in his favor?

1034
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:34,258
No. He's one of the best jet men
in the United States.

1035
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:36,458
You couldn't ask
for a better encyclopedia.

1036
01:16:36,533 --> 01:16:38,864
And you're one of the best in this country,

1037
01:16:38,935 --> 01:16:41,732
and I cannot believe the Americans
got much information out of you.

1038
01:16:41,802 --> 01:16:44,964
Of course not.
But this is different.

1039
01:16:45,038 --> 01:16:48,028
Why?
The man's in love with me.

1040
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:50,199
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

1041
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:53,538
You believe he's completely
under your domination?

1042
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,601
Haven't I proved that?

1043
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,943
Vassily, I am glad to see you again.

1044
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:02,981
This is my husband,
Colonel Shannon,

1045
01:17:03,049 --> 01:17:05,107
late of the United States Air Force.

1046
01:17:05,183 --> 01:17:07,840
Colonel Shannon, it's a rare
privilege to welcome an American

1047
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:10,141
Air Force officer to the
Soviet Union, however late.

1048
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:13,312
You're the first, but I hope
you will not be the last.

1049
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:15,446
I hope so too.

1050
01:17:18,992 --> 01:17:23,188
And I salute your courage...
and your judgment.

1051
01:17:23,261 --> 01:17:26,524
It's quite a story.
Would you like to hear it?

1052
01:17:26,597 --> 01:17:29,792
No, no, I've heard all about it.

1053
01:17:29,865 --> 01:17:34,267
My interest in you
is going to be purely technical.

1054
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:40,903
<i>(BUZZER SOUNDS)</i>

1055
01:17:40,972 --> 01:17:44,235
You've had a long day's travel.
You must be a little tired.

1056
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:47,468
I haven't been getting
much rest lately.

1057
01:17:49,277 --> 01:17:51,676
Show this gentleman to his quarters.

1058
01:17:55,081 --> 01:17:57,878
I'll call on you tomorrow
around 10:00.

1059
01:17:57,948 --> 01:17:59,939
Okay, sir.

1060
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:10,621
Well, go ahead.
After you, sir.

1061
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:12,623
Go on!
You go first.

1062
01:18:12,691 --> 01:18:14,623
We insist. What's the
matter with these guys?

1063
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,381
Well, they were told to follow us.
How can

1064
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:18,183
they follow us if you
tell them to go ahead?

1065
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:20,751
Oh.

1066
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,762
Pardon me.

1067
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:31,834
Why are they following us?
I'm afraid your

1068
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,099
movements here will be
more or less restricted.

1069
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,138
Maria.
Olga.

1070
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,707
Who was that? Don't you remember
that famous woman sniper?

1071
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:45,834
The one who killed over a hundred Germans?
That's her.

1072
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:48,344
Well, is that the way
you reward your heroes?

1073
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:52,972
Well, the trip she made to the States had
rather a strange affect on her. It did?

1074
01:18:53,048 --> 01:18:55,881
When she came back,
she started shooting at Russians.

1075
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,849
Right in there, sir.
The door is unlocked.

1076
01:19:03,888 --> 01:19:07,345
Not quite as nice as your place
in Palmer Field.

1077
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:09,914
Palmer Field.

1078
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:12,391
Are you sorry you left it?

1079
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,654
Would it do any good if I were?

1080
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:17,753
No. Why worry about it? Come on.

1081
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:20,923
My quarters are over there.
Your quarters?

1082
01:19:20,999 --> 01:19:24,433
I received very definite orders
to that effect before I left Moscow.

1083
01:19:24,501 --> 01:19:27,833
What's wrong? You're my wife, aren't you?
Yes, but orders are orders.

1084
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:31,167
What are they up to?
Are they trying to put pressure on me?

1085
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:33,672
Well, you haven't been
too cooperative.

1086
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:35,707
I've been talking my head off.
That's true.

1087
01:19:35,774 --> 01:19:39,641
But so far, you haven't told us anything
we don't know. Well, it's not my fault.

1088
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,644
There's a lot of stuff
I seem to have forgotten.

1089
01:19:41,712 --> 01:19:43,872
I can't make it out.

1090
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:46,311
I usually have a pretty good memory.

1091
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,780
I may see you tomorrow.
Well, wait a minute.

1092
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:51,907
Why? This is all so sudden.
I'm gonna miss you.

1093
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:54,315
Don't worry. You'll have
a batman to look after you.

1094
01:19:54,385 --> 01:19:57,080
A batman?
What do I want with a batman?

1095
01:19:57,154 --> 01:20:01,714
He'll come in and he'll cook for you and
clean up, do your laundry and so forth.

1096
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:05,657
And so forth? Shall I let him
wash that nightie of yours?

1097
01:20:05,726 --> 01:20:08,626
Did I put that in your suitcase?
Oh, don't let the batman touch it.

1098
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:10,628
Please hide it somewhere for me.
Hide it?

1099
01:20:10,695 --> 01:20:12,629
He'll steal it.
A nightgown?

1100
01:20:12,697 --> 01:20:15,893
You can't buy anything like that in the
Soviet. I wouldn't lose it for anything.

1101
01:20:15,966 --> 01:20:18,933
I'm not even going to wear it anymore.
I don't blame you.

1102
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:21,025
I'll bring it over to you after dinner.

1103
01:20:21,102 --> 01:20:23,262
You'd better not.

1104
01:20:23,337 --> 01:20:25,997
You mean I can't come
and see you if I want to?

1105
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:29,039
Not unless I receive orders to that effect.
And you can't come and see me?

1106
01:20:29,106 --> 01:20:31,267
No.
I won't stand for it.

1107
01:20:31,341 --> 01:20:34,571
I don't know what else you can do.

1108
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:37,133
I'll complain to Washington.

1109
01:20:42,548 --> 01:20:45,482
Well, it looks like Shannon
still has everything under control.

1110
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,483
Did you hear
from the State Department?

1111
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,541
The Russian government says
they have no record...

1112
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:53,611
of a ColonelJames Shannon being found
in Siberia or elsewhere as yet.

1113
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:57,019
I guess that means Shannon
hasn't reached the end of his rope.

1114
01:20:57,090 --> 01:20:59,956
When are you gonna raise the ante?
Ten days, two weeks.

1115
01:21:00,026 --> 01:21:04,859
We might offer as high as half a dozen
Soviet agents in exchange forJim.

1116
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:07,453
Well, I think it ought to
be done right away. Why?

1117
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,862
Well, he might run out of stuff to tell
'em. You heard what that Russian dame said.

1118
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:15,231
To them, pressure means torture...
or worse.

1119
01:21:15,302 --> 01:21:18,861
I'd like to know what that drug is
that they use. We know what it is.

1120
01:21:18,937 --> 01:21:21,303
The same stuff they gave
Cardinal Mindszenty? Mm-hmm.

1121
01:21:21,372 --> 01:21:23,806
Worst part of it,
they've improved it.

1122
01:21:23,873 --> 01:21:29,400
Now it even makes you forget
that you've forgotten.

1123
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:32,934
We've been making excellent progress
with Colonel Shannon.

1124
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:37,380
Until yesterday, I've been completely
satisfied in regard to his sincerity.

1125
01:21:37,448 --> 01:21:42,008
What happened? Well, I brought up the
matter of the parasite fighters.

1126
01:21:42,084 --> 01:21:44,142
He said he had
no experience with them.

1127
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:47,187
That's quite possible.
I don't think so.

1128
01:21:47,254 --> 01:21:50,222
We know they've perfected their method
of hooking back onto the mother bomber,

1129
01:21:50,289 --> 01:21:54,691
which could only have been done
by experts of his type.

1130
01:21:54,759 --> 01:21:56,693
He never mentioned
any such work to me.

1131
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,718
I still think you might
be able to help us. How?

1132
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:04,890
Perhaps you can persuade him
to show us their method.

1133
01:22:04,965 --> 01:22:07,270
You mean for him to
actually fly one of our

1134
01:22:07,286 --> 01:22:09,923
parasite jets and return
it to the mother bomber?

1135
01:22:10,001 --> 01:22:12,264
Do you want him to be killed?
Of course not.

1136
01:22:12,335 --> 01:22:15,065
But you know there must be something
wrong with our methods or our equipment.

1137
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:17,264
We've already lost several
of our best pilots.

1138
01:22:17,339 --> 01:22:20,329
If our equipment or our methods
are at fault,

1139
01:22:20,408 --> 01:22:25,275
then Colonel Shannon will naturally
tell us what's wrong before he uses them.

1140
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:30,204
That seems reasonable.

1141
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,474
Whether or not he'll see it that way,
I can't promise.

1142
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:34,845
Why not? This is a
matter of vital tactics.

1143
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:37,577
You should have no trouble.
Why?

1144
01:22:37,651 --> 01:22:40,880
He betrayed the United States for you.
He became a deserter on your behalf.

1145
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:45,081
Compared to that,
this parasite fighter thing means nothing.

1146
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:47,750
Well, I suppose not.

1147
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:50,383
And then again,
it may be the last straw.

1148
01:22:50,459 --> 01:22:54,393
For him, or for you? Why not for me?
What do you think I'm made of?

1149
01:22:54,461 --> 01:22:57,658
Isn't there a limit of what can be asked
of me too? I know how you feel, Olga.

1150
01:22:57,731 --> 01:23:00,095
But you've done pretty well
with him so far. I know.

1151
01:23:00,165 --> 01:23:02,395
But I think it's a mistake
to use me at this point.

1152
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:04,933
And I wish you'd tell Moscow so.
It's too palpable...

1153
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:08,765
I'm sorry, Olga,
but you have no choice in the matter.

1154
01:23:08,836 --> 01:23:12,532
I was instructed to give you this
in case you proved reluctant.

1155
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:20,373
See ya tomorrow, boys.

1156
01:23:20,444 --> 01:23:23,640
<i>(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)</i>

1157
01:23:37,588 --> 01:23:41,886
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Olga.

1158
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:49,661
Why don't you come over here?

1159
01:23:50,895 --> 01:23:53,329
The payload on that bed
is pretty low.

1160
01:23:53,397 --> 01:23:55,523
(CHUCKLING)

1161
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:02,702
You don't seem surprised to see me.
Why should I be?

1162
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:05,761
I've been expecting you, Olga.

1163
01:24:05,839 --> 01:24:10,239
"Olga."
You haven't called me that lately.

1164
01:24:10,308 --> 01:24:12,901
Well, I always think of you
as two girls...

1165
01:24:12,976 --> 01:24:15,442
Anna, the lovely kid
I thought was a refugee,

1166
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:19,808
and Olga, a Soviet Tootsie Roll
that made a chump out of me.

1167
01:24:19,879 --> 01:24:22,312
You still hate me for that,
don't you?

1168
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:25,349
And you came here tonight
to do the same thing.

1169
01:24:26,984 --> 01:24:29,577
They said they'd transfer me
if I didn't.

1170
01:24:29,652 --> 01:24:32,119
Where?
To Hungary.

1171
01:24:32,187 --> 01:24:34,950
Well, what's so terrible about that?

1172
01:24:55,301 --> 01:24:58,565
Do you think I could survive
being separated from you?

1173
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:03,863
Where did I hear that before?

1174
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,766
It was true then.
It's even more true now.

1175
01:25:08,843 --> 01:25:13,072
What are you talking about?
I don't know. I...

1176
01:25:13,145 --> 01:25:15,443
I guess I've fallen in
love with you. Huh?

1177
01:25:15,514 --> 01:25:18,607
I've fallen in love with you!
I thought you didn't believe in it.

1178
01:25:18,682 --> 01:25:20,979
I don't.
I thought I hated you...

1179
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:23,847
as much as I hated your country
and everything it stands for.

1180
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:26,147
And now you only hate
my country?

1181
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:29,447
I don't hate anything.

1182
01:25:29,522 --> 01:25:32,888
That's what makes it so strange.
I can't understand it.

1183
01:25:34,825 --> 01:25:36,792
You're good, Olga.

1184
01:25:36,859 --> 01:25:39,952
I gotta hand it to you, baby.
You're the best I've ever seen.

1185
01:25:40,028 --> 01:25:42,552
You don't believe me?
Why should I?

1186
01:25:42,631 --> 01:25:44,563
All right. Let me go.
Why?

1187
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:46,565
Why should I stay here?
Why shouldn't you?

1188
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:48,566
You don't believe me.
You still hate me.

1189
01:25:48,633 --> 01:25:52,090
Will you stay if I show 'em
how to handle that parasite fighter?

1190
01:25:55,504 --> 01:25:57,562
Are you serious?

1191
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,607
It's all you wanted,
wasn't it?

1192
01:25:59,673 --> 01:26:01,902
Well, of course.
Then they won't transfer me.

1193
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:04,067
Okay, it's a deal.

1194

Oh, Jim!

1195
01:26:06,545 --> 01:26:09,638
But I'm not doing it for you.

1196
01:26:09,713 --> 01:26:12,805
<i>I'm doing it for myself.
Yourself?</i>

1197
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:16,713
Sure. There's nothing secret
about that parasite fighter stuff.

1198
01:26:16,783 --> 01:26:19,876
But I knew if I held out on it,
they'd send you over to work on me.

1199
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:21,885
Nothing secret about it?

1200
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:24,421
All the magazines and papers
in the United States...

1201
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:27,251
have had big spreads on it,
including diagrams.

1202
01:26:27,324 --> 01:26:31,724
And we only do that with projects
we've decided to abandon.

1203
01:26:31,793 --> 01:26:34,124
Still love me?
Oh, let me go!

1204
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:37,425
Why? You think I'd stay
here another minute?

1205
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:39,487
Why not?

1206
01:26:41,766 --> 01:26:43,756
(GRUNTS)

1207
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,294

1211
01:27:01,578 --> 01:27:03,512
<i>Will you give me my pants?</i>

1212
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:06,706
What are you hiding behind that barrel for?
Why don't you get in it?

1213
01:27:06,781 --> 01:27:09,476
<i>Give me back my pants!</i>

1214
01:27:09,549 --> 01:27:11,846
I think I'll keep 'em for a souvenir.

<i>The whole regimental band
is coming down the street!</i>

1221
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:45,959
The regimental band?
How many pieces?

1222
01:27:46,038 --> 01:27:48,369
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Open the door!</i>

<i>You're gonna have to cooperate a little.
What do you mean?</i>

1227
01:28:02,548 --> 01:28:05,744
Gonna have to do a little pushing
from the other side.

1228
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,698
What are you looking for?

1229
01:28:32,766 --> 01:28:35,097
I've run out of cigarettes.
Have you got some?

1230
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:37,157
Russian ones.

1231
01:29:10,022 --> 01:29:13,115
Where'd you get these matches?
Out of your jacket.

1232
01:29:28,767 --> 01:29:32,292
If you ever hear of me holding out again,
you'll know it's on account of two things...

1233
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,802
American cigarettes
and American coffee.

1234
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,635
<i>Those generals cleaned me out.
(PHONE RINGING)</i>

1235
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,105
I guess that's for me.

1236
01:29:45,544 --> 01:29:47,773
Yes?

1237
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:50,472
<i>Yes, this is she.</i>

1238
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:56,716
<i>Good morning, Colonel Sokolov.</i>

1239
01:29:58,419 --> 01:30:02,615
Yes, he's agreed to show us all he knows
about the parasite fighter.

1240
01:30:04,555 --> 01:30:06,715
Good. I'll tell him.

1241
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:09,019
He's coming by for you
in a few minutes.

1242
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:10,931
Why didn't you tell him
our people had found out

1243
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,651
the whole business wasn't
worth the trouble?

1244
01:30:12,727 --> 01:30:17,128
He wouldn't believe it.
Why, these matches are from Yuma.

1245
01:30:17,196 --> 01:30:19,356
Yeah, I've been keeping 'em
for a souvenir.

1246
01:30:19,432 --> 01:30:22,160
Oh, Yuma.

1247
01:30:22,232 --> 01:30:24,859
May I have them?
Not a chance.

1248
01:30:24,934 --> 01:30:27,594
Oh, Jim.
What's this? Nothing.

1249
01:30:27,668 --> 01:30:30,501
Then why'd you snatch it like that?

1250
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:33,562
I'd better get the rest
of my flying togs.

1251
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:48,539
Give me those matches, Jim.

1252
01:30:48,616 --> 01:30:52,345
Now, don't get all excited.
I'm serious.

1253
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:55,010
Then why have you got the safety on?

1254
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:57,077
(GROANS)

1255
01:31:16,832 --> 01:31:22,167
You sure know your stuff, Olga.
You're not so bad yourself.

1256
01:31:23,737 --> 01:31:25,669
I was only kiddin' ya.

1257
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:29,036
That's just a list of the things
they've been questioning me about.

1258
01:31:29,107 --> 01:31:31,039
It's quite clear.

1259
01:31:31,108 --> 01:31:36,305
I only jotted 'em down
so I wouldn't get all mixed up.

1260
01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:39,004
I told ya how I keep forgetting.

1261
01:31:39,078 --> 01:31:42,706
Perhaps. But it's also
an almost complete list...

1262
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:44,839
of every weakness
in the Soviet Air Force.

1263
01:31:44,915 --> 01:31:48,372
Well, that isn't my fault. There isn't a
thing there they haven't asked me about.

1264
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:50,475
You can check
with Colonel Sokolov.

1265
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:53,019
I'm going to check with
Moscow first. Why?

1266
01:31:53,087 --> 01:31:56,453
You've swindled him too.
Me? What did I do?

1267
01:31:56,523 --> 01:31:58,114
<i>What did you do to me?</i>

1268
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:00,919
Oh, you weren't such a chump after all.
You made a chump out of me.

1269
01:32:00,992 --> 01:32:04,949
You made chumps out of all of us, you...
you Yankee gangster.

1270
01:32:05,028 --> 01:32:09,088
And all the time, I thought it was
because you... Now you know how I felt.

1271
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:11,964
Is that why you did it?

1272
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:13,966
Could be.

1273
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:17,968
The idea of paying you off in rubles
was pretty hard to resist.

1274
01:32:18,037 --> 01:32:21,471
You risked more than I did.
It was worth it.

1275
01:32:21,538 --> 01:32:24,232
One thing I can't understand.

1276
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,264
Now that you've gathered
all this information, how

1277
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,139
did you ever plan to get
out of Russia with it?

1278
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,574
Same way I got in.
What do you think I am?

1279
01:32:31,644 --> 01:32:34,271
I'm not worried.
You've got too big for it.

1280
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:37,939
Big for what?
Your Soviet straightjacket.

1281
01:32:39,349 --> 01:32:41,612
Is that a fact?

1282
01:32:41,684 --> 01:32:44,015
Wait a minute, Olga.

1283
01:32:44,085 --> 01:32:47,247
If you turn me in, you'll be
turning yourself in too. Why?

1284
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,549
You brought me here, didn't you?

1285
01:32:49,622 --> 01:32:53,079
And if I know Moscow,
we'll both end up against the same wall.

1286
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:56,819
Don't worry. They won't shoot you.
Why not?

1287
01:32:56,893 --> 01:33:00,918
You're 10 times more valuable as an enemy
agent than you ever were as a traitor.

1288
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:05,293
What are you gonna do,
have me stuffed?

1289
01:33:05,365 --> 01:33:08,060
Courage won't help you.
Your government trusts you.

1290
01:33:08,133 --> 01:33:11,760
<i>And if I know Moscow,
they'll really make use of that.</i>

1291
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,894
All that bunk about love last night.

1292
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:18,597
I knew it wasn't on the level.

1293
01:33:18,672 --> 01:33:21,106
Or was it?
Stay where you are, Jim!

1294
01:33:25,876 --> 01:33:28,208
Must be Colonel Sokolov.

1295
01:33:28,279 --> 01:33:30,974
Let him in.

1296
01:33:31,047 --> 01:33:33,276
Let him in yourself.

1297
01:34:00,131 --> 01:34:02,098
Good morning, Colonel.
Be right with you.

1298
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,661
Pardon me, Colonel.

1299
01:34:14,806 --> 01:34:19,504
If this be forever, baby,
then forever fare thee well.

1300
01:34:32,784 --> 01:34:37,186
This is Lieutenant Orlieff. I wish to
speak to General Langrad in Moscow.

1301
01:34:39,956 --> 01:34:43,355
Yes, General Dimitri Langrad.

1302
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:46,449
(RINGING)

1303
01:34:46,526 --> 01:34:49,221
Yes? Who?

1304
01:34:49,294 --> 01:34:51,227
Put her through.

1305
01:34:51,295 --> 01:34:53,285
I'll call you back.

1306
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,164
Well, Olga, what can I do for you?

1307
01:34:57,232 --> 01:35:00,092
Something has happened
that I must report, sir.

1308
01:35:00,107 --> 01:35:01,066
Go ahead.

1309
01:35:01,135 --> 01:35:03,967
It's in regard to my husband,
Colonel Shannon.

1310
01:35:05,872 --> 01:35:07,862
Well,

1311
01:35:09,173 --> 01:35:11,333
I, uh...

1312
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:13,533
I merely wanted to suggest that...

1313
01:35:13,609 --> 01:35:17,476
Colonel Sokolov be a little more discreet
when interrogating him.

1314
01:35:19,412 --> 01:35:21,606
Well, my husband has been
talking things over with me,

1315
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,546
and while he doesn't seem
to realize it himself,

1316
01:35:24,616 --> 01:35:27,426
it's quite clear to me that Colonel
Sokolov is only questioning

1317
01:35:27,442 --> 01:35:29,916
him about subjects we've made
little or no progress in.

1318
01:35:29,986 --> 01:35:32,044
What's wrong with that?

1319
01:35:34,655 --> 01:35:37,020
Oh, you think he should
be more subtle?

1320
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,389
I'll think it over.
Perhaps you're right.

1321
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:44,450
I had no idea Colonel Sokolov
was so well-informed,

1322
01:35:44,528 --> 01:35:46,518
or you either for that matter.

1323
01:36:24,018 --> 01:36:25,668
If you're gonna get
anywhere with these things,

1324
01:36:25,684 --> 01:36:27,384
you'd better breed yourselves
a race of midgets.

1325
01:36:29,555 --> 01:36:31,489
What are you doin' over here?

1326
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:33,682
I heard you were going
to make the drop in this thing today.

1327
01:36:33,757 --> 01:36:37,351
They're sure in an awful rush.
No wonder you lose so many pilots.

1328
01:36:37,426 --> 01:36:40,861
If you're not ready to do it, you
don't have to do it. Who said so?

1329
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:42,715
Colonel Sokolov. He promised me that.
But he

1330
01:36:42,731 --> 01:36:44,693
hasn't been around for the
last couple of weeks.

1331
01:36:44,764 --> 01:36:48,392
He was sent to Moscow. But why don't
you wait until he comes back?

1332
01:36:48,466 --> 01:36:52,093
Oh, I'm as ready as I'll ever be, but...
But what?

1333
01:36:52,168 --> 01:36:56,069
That rocket motor's about as reliable
as a $2 coronet.

1334
01:36:56,138 --> 01:36:58,071
Even with you working on it?

1335
01:36:58,139 --> 01:37:02,597
We only let you people steal
our defective stuff.

1336
01:37:02,675 --> 01:37:05,165
Yeah, I know that.

1337
01:37:05,243 --> 01:37:07,233
That's why I'm so worried about you.

1338
01:37:08,478 --> 01:37:11,309
Don't worry, baby.
I love you too.

1339
01:37:12,615 --> 01:37:15,776
You're not lying to me?
What are we gonna have for lunch?

1340
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:18,249
Same as we had yesterday.
Blintzes!

1341
01:37:18,318 --> 01:37:21,309
We had those the day before too.
Well, what would you like?

1342
01:37:21,385 --> 01:37:24,649
How about a nice, big, juicy steak?

1343
01:37:24,721 --> 01:37:27,712
Mmm! Palm Springs.

1344
01:37:27,790 --> 01:37:30,224
Haven't you anyplace
like that around here?

1345
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:34,226
I don't think there's anyplace
like that in the whole world.

1346
01:37:40,698 --> 01:37:43,029
There's Colonel Matoff.

1347
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,067
Aren't you gonna say good-bye?

1348
01:37:45,134 --> 01:37:48,795
Oh, no. Good luck.

1349
01:37:51,503 --> 01:37:55,404
Colonel Matoff!
My dear Olga, how you've changed.

1350
01:37:55,473 --> 01:37:57,839
Changed? Yes, you're more
beautiful than ever.

1351
01:37:57,909 --> 01:38:02,605
Colonel Matoff!
Oh.

1352
01:38:09,915 --> 01:38:12,475
How is everything in Berlin?
Well the,

1353
01:38:12,551 --> 01:38:15,313
uh...

1354
01:38:15,385 --> 01:38:18,012
the Americans are still there.

1355
01:38:18,087 --> 01:38:20,020
(CHUCKLES)

1356
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:22,613
I must congratulate you on the way
you've handled this one of yours.

1357
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:24,987
Moscow is very pleased
as you shall see.

1358
01:38:25,058 --> 01:38:28,253
They've given you
another important project.

1359
01:38:28,326 --> 01:38:30,317
Excuse me.

1360
01:38:37,332 --> 01:38:39,265
I must find Colonel Sokolov.

1361
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:42,529
If you mean your superior officer,
you won't have to look very far.

1362
01:38:42,602 --> 01:38:44,899
Why?
I'm taking his place.

1363
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:48,267
This is the passenger
mentioned in your orders.

1364
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:50,601
Captain Orlieff,
may I present Lieutenant Diompkin.

1365
01:38:50,673 --> 01:38:53,437
"Captain"?
You've been promoted.

1366
01:38:53,509 --> 01:38:56,306
Lieutenant Diompkin
is your assistant.

1367
01:38:56,378 --> 01:38:59,641
Really?
Your plane is ready, Captain.

1368
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,680
I'll be with you
in a few moments.

1369
01:39:02,747 --> 01:39:06,614
Uh, Colonel Sokolov, he has
been promoted also? Oh, yes,

1370
01:39:06,683 --> 01:39:09,207
to the uranium mine.

1371
01:39:09,285 --> 01:39:12,048
<i>Colonel Sokolov?
(LAUGHING)</i>

1372
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:16,350
You're the only one who hasn't been
contaminated by this American.

1373
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:20,522
Thank goodness I shall have
no personal contact with him.

1374
01:39:20,592 --> 01:39:22,456
Why?

1375
01:39:22,526 --> 01:39:27,291
He's to be exchanged for five
very valuable countrymen of ours.

1376
01:39:27,362 --> 01:39:30,057
When?

1377
01:39:30,131 --> 01:39:34,294
Well, if he doesn't
get blown up in that thing,

1378
01:39:34,367 --> 01:39:36,458
I have orders to send him
to Moscow tomorrow...

1379
01:39:36,534 --> 01:39:40,902
<i>where, I imagine, he'll be turned over
to the American ambassador.</i>

1380
01:39:40,971 --> 01:39:42,904
Tomorrow?

1381
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,673
Oh, it's time for you to leave.

1382
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,537
Now?
Yes, you must leave at once.

1383
01:39:49,643 --> 01:39:51,633
Tomorrow?

1384
01:40:14,291 --> 01:40:17,623
Why are you so concerned?

1385
01:40:17,694 --> 01:40:19,751
I think it's a great mistake.

1386
01:40:19,828 --> 01:40:22,226
To exchange this American?

1387
01:40:22,295 --> 01:40:25,092
Aren't you a little tired
of him by now?

1388
01:40:25,164 --> 01:40:28,291
You know my personal feelings
are of no consequence.

1389
01:40:28,366 --> 01:40:32,892
Then why do you say
it's a great mistake to exchange him?

1390
01:40:32,969 --> 01:40:35,869
I'm afraid he knows too much.
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry.

1391
01:40:35,937 --> 01:40:38,030
General Langrad
is taking care of that.

1392
01:40:38,105 --> 01:40:40,335
General Langrad?

1393
01:40:40,407 --> 01:40:45,604
He has ordered me to see that Colonel
Shannon be given the final medication...

1394
01:40:45,677 --> 01:40:48,872
<i>before he is turned over
to the American ambassador.</i>

1395
01:40:48,945 --> 01:40:50,879
Medication?

1396
01:40:50,946 --> 01:40:53,607
Didn't you know we've been
giving it to him all along?

1397
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:57,874
No.
Yes.

1398
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:00,042
Our new technique...

1399
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:02,450
just in very small doses, of course.

1400
01:41:02,519 --> 01:41:06,249
<i>Just enough to make him forget
his loyalty to his...</i>

1401
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:08,950
<i>dirty, rotten, capitalistic country.</i>

1402
01:41:09,024 --> 01:41:12,117
That's why his memory's
been so bad.

1403
01:41:12,193 --> 01:41:15,161
When he returns for lunch...

1404
01:41:15,228 --> 01:41:17,160
if he does return...

1405
01:41:17,229 --> 01:41:19,924
I'll arrange to have
the final dose placed in his food.

1406
01:41:19,998 --> 01:41:23,228
<i>It will be a massive one,
but completely tasteless...</i>

1407
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,733
<i>in either a stew
or an omelet.</i>

1408
01:41:25,801 --> 01:41:29,360
But won't that destroy
his memory entirely?

1409
01:41:29,436 --> 01:41:32,370
(CHUCKLING)

1410
01:41:32,438 --> 01:41:35,701
In 36 hours,
he'll be a complete idiot.

1411
01:41:35,773 --> 01:41:39,606
<i>Won't even remember who he is,
much less you.</i>

1412
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:42,906
And now if you'll pardon me,
I must talk with the local medical staff.

1413
01:41:42,978 --> 01:41:44,911
Good-bye.

1414
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:08,792
You ever bailed out
of one of these planes before?

1415
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:12,454
No, Captain. I'm not a flier.
I've never even been in a jet before.

1416
01:42:14,296 --> 01:42:17,264
I've, uh, been having
a little trouble with this one.

1417
01:42:17,332 --> 01:42:20,266
Maybe I'd better take it up myself
to make sure it's all right.

1418
01:42:22,435 --> 01:42:24,402
I'm sorry, Captain.

1419
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:26,561
I've been ordered not
to let you out of my sight.

1420
01:42:28,005 --> 01:42:29,938
Is that a fact?

1421
01:42:30,006 --> 01:42:31,996
Yes, Captain.

1422
01:42:32,074 --> 01:42:35,065
I've been instructed
to go wherever you go.

1423
01:42:40,379 --> 01:42:42,313
Very well.

1424
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:45,246
Get up in the back seat.
You can watch me from there.

1425
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:51,609
Oh!

1426
01:42:51,686 --> 01:42:54,244
Now you put
the other foot over there.

1427
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,310
(STRAINING)

1428
01:42:58,956 --> 01:43:00,947
Here.

1429
01:43:06,128 --> 01:43:09,494
You comfortable?

1430
01:43:09,564 --> 01:43:12,690
No, Captain,
it's rather a tight fit.

1431
01:43:14,066 --> 01:43:17,865
Oh. Well, in that case,
just pull that little red lever.

1432
01:43:17,935 --> 01:43:19,869
Then you'll have plenty of room.

1433
01:43:21,204 --> 01:43:23,865
Thank you, Captain.

1434
01:43:34,112 --> 01:43:36,238
Hey!
What's wrong?

1435
01:43:36,314 --> 01:43:40,111
He made a mistake. He pulled the seat
ejector instead of the seat adjustor.

1436
01:43:40,182 --> 01:43:42,548
Aah!

1437
01:44:37,584 --> 01:44:41,019
After you get this thing unbuckled,
buzz me twice before you turn me loose.

Oh? What's on your mind?

1444
01:45:28,313 --> 01:45:32,180
That steak you were talking about.
Did you get one?

1445
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,184
No. I'm afraid...

1446
01:45:34,252 --> 01:45:37,083
we'll have to get it at the same place
we had it last time.

I repeat: The same place.

The same place? What are you talkin' about?
Where are you?

1449
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:45,117
You know that jet
that's guarding you on top?

1450
01:45:45,192 --> 01:45:48,216
Yeah.
I'm right underneath him.

Enough to get us to Vienna.

Good. Give her the gun.

1471

Yes.
Well, make a right turn into it.

whip to the left.

Maybe we can lose them. I was just
thinking the same thing. Here we go!

Cigarettes?

Cigarettes?

1483
01:51:50,546 --> 01:51:55,537
Mmm, Papa. Is this a steak,
or is this a steak?

I bet that's all
you came back for.

It's one of the reasons.

If I could make my people
realize that things like

this are better than all
