165
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,599
Cold sober for 10
years, and now he's
just getting--

166
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,201
Well, so what, Bruce?
You ever hear the phrase
"To hell with it?"

167
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,369
You've got a gun nut.

168
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,638
He goes around waving
loaded guns.

169
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,440
You've got 5 women
come out of the woodwork--

170
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,808
"He did the same
thing to me."

171
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,842
You've got the chauffeur.

172
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,411
The chauffeur
is on record--

173
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,679
"My boss came out:
I think I just
killed somebody."

174
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,181
Well, exclude
the woman.

175
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,182
How? On EWOL?

176
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,483
You bet.

177
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,619
No, I say the judge
allows it under Caitlyn.

178
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,821
In which case
it's reversible.

179
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,122
I'm doing a TV show.

180
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,657
Really? About the case?

181
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,125
No, independent of
the case.

182
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,193
Oh, great.

183
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,162
Now, the chauffeur.

184
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,464
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce,
he shot the girl.

185
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,999
He shot the girl, all right?

186
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,066
He's a freak.

187
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,668
Those are the public
who don't hate him.

188
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,236
He's a genius.

189
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,372
He transformed
the entire
music industry.

190

What's that--what's that
kid's name--James?

191
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,042
James. James?

192
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,612
I'm Linda Kenney
Baden.

193
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,314
Could you tell me
what this is?

194
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,383
I'll give you
a dollar if you can
tell me.

195
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,651
Is it something
to do with music?

196
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,852
Why would you
say that?

197
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,053
Because the case
has to do with music.

198
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,154
No, no, no.

199
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,589
The case has nothing
to do with music.

200
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,693
No. This is an insert
that allows a 45 RPM
record to be played

201
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,329
on an LP phonograph, OK?
Now...

202
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,330
OK.

203
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,865
What is this?

204
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,905
Something to do with
an early computer.

205
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,640
Mmm.

206
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,812
Put it on
your key chain.

207
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,681
It's a piece
of the past.

208
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,049
Mmm.

209
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,285
This kid doesn't know
what a phonograph is,

210
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,688
a 45, a--a transistor
radio.

211
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,791
Nobody on the jury
is gonna know anything
except your guy's

212
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,159
a murderer and a freak.

213
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,460
The girl killed herself.

214
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,329
Well, maybe, but
I don't want to take
that case.

215
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,396
There...

216
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,464
I don't like
that case.

217
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,899
There is no evidence.

218
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,300
There's no blood
spatter on his cuff.

219
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,436
Well, you've got--
as to the blood
spatter--

220
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,373
There is no blood spatter
on the back wall. Why?

221
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,474
Why?

222
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,144
Linda, the bullet
lodged in the skull.

223
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,446
The skull was intact.

224
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,881
All the blood
in the brain matter
had to come

225
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,683
out of the mouth
toward him.

226
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,285
Exact model of
the coat he wore.

227
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,386
Exact model.

228
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Blood spatter?

229
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,822
You find it. Go ahead.

230
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,091
It's more than
a pinpoint, Bruce.
I read the report.

231
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,425
It's more than one,
and--

232
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,161
And it is inconsistent with
anything but a defensive--

233
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,663
Bruce...

234
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,466
a defensive movement.
and the angle of the shot
is inconsistent.

235
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
The only way
he walks--

236
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,302
I think
he's not guilty.

237
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,238
Of course you do.
The only way, however,
that he walks is what?

238
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,573
She shot herself.

239
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,607
That's right. Why?

240
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,742
She was depressed.

241
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,010
We have a history
of e-mails, comments...

242
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,512
They let O.J. go.
They let Michael
Jackson go.

243
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,681
They are not gonna
let him go.

244
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,816
They will be trying him
for the murder of
O.J.'s wife,

245
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,286
and they will find him
guilty.

00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,656
The girl was crazy,
Linda.

248
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,958
She made this tape
to promote herself
as an actress.

to attack the girl,

He changed the tune
as he came to me.

What would you tell
your students?

283

Would you say,

your sensibilities,"

or is he presumed
innocent?

Because you're
screwed up,

because you
read the same gossip
everybody else did,

he's guilty.

All right, they
think he's guilty.

No.

I might need one.

00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,812
Why would you need
more than one?

I don't know.

about guns?

How do you feel
about them?

502
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,998
I can take them
or leave them.

503

Yeah, but if you
leave them and somebody

I have a question, Linda.

609
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:27,638
If Jesus was so big,
why did they kill him?

610
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,906
Because he was
the son of God.

611
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
No!

612
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,476
Because he was still
the son of God.

613
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,678

What is news, then?

617
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,223
News is that he likes
little boys,

618
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,561
that he's a thief,
that he cheats
on his wife.

619
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,565
Or in the absence
of any fault,
that he's just

620
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,834
too goddamn big
for his fucking britches,

621
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,571
which is why
they killed Christ.

They told me it was
too long.

626
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,117
Came in at 4 minutes
and 5 seconds.

627
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,221
Nobody could release
a cut over 2 1/2 minutes.

628
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,089
So, what did I do?

629
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,425
I redid the labels.

630
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:26,263
"Running time 2 minutes,
48 seconds."

631
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,400
I didn't change
the length.
I changed the label.

632
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,104
They played it.
It made everybody rich.

enlisted as a private.

957
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,424
You--you want to explain
that to me?

958
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,427
So, what is it, then?

959
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,462
What are we talking
about here?

960
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,097
Hatred.

961
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,033
What do they hate
about me?

962

I'm alive.

You know the saying
"The good die young," right?

964

Why?

965
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,046
Because the file
is closed.

966
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,016
REPORTER: I understand.
Have you said that--

967
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,852
This is the story.

968
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,654
The girl exceeded
her shelf life.

969
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,624
She's in L.A.
She's down on her luck.
She is broke.

970
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,625
Spector didn't help her?

971
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,893
That's not his job.

972
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:57,894
You're thinking
of Christ.
He's not Christ.

973
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,396
He's a guy. He
wanted affirmation.

974
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,397
He wanted sex.

975
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,332
68-year-old guy.
It's the same thing.

976
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,367
What is he--
pussy-crazed?

977
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,602
OK, she's working
in some bar.

978
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,738
A guy comes in.
She brushes him off.

979

The boss says,
"Do you know
who that is?"

980
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,208
So, what we have
is a car crash.

981

She's lonely.

982

supposed to do?

I'm lonely"?

These women come out and say
I pulled a gun on them.

994

Where were they at the time
of the supposed offense?

995
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,970
No. They came out
of the woodwork years later.

996
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,004
They came out
at the time.

997

No. Bullshit.

998
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,876
They--no. They didn't even
press their case. Come on!

999
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,412
They came out when
it was in their interest
to come out--

1000
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,648
they came out when there was
something in it for them.

1001
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,183
What was in it?
Publicity.

1002
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,284
What did Lana Clarkson want?

1003
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,452
Publicity.

1004
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,620
What do they all want?

1005
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,556
People--people think
it's contagious--

1006
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,227
you can get it by hanging
around someone

1007

who's got it.

1008

I would have helped--

00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,300
why not?

1010
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,471
came in here and ruined my life
by sticking a gun

1011
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,007
in her mouth.

1012
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,276
For--for what?

1013
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,779
For what?

1014
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,080
For what is this
retribution?

1015
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,083
For what am I
being punished?

1016
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,553
For being the most
successful music producer

1017
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,522
in the history
of the world.

1018
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,423
And if you think
that's bullshit,

1019
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,660
then you're not
as smart as I know you are.

1020
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:46,469
I am--I am so sorry
that that girl,

1021
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,406
that her life
was full of suffering.

1022
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,544
I'm sorry she died.

1023
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,445
I didn't do it.

1024
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,451
The State says
the gun was in her mouth.

1025
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,754
If he were 10 feet away,
could he have done it?

BRUCE: The prosecution says
you didn't go to her,
you didn't touch her.

1027

LINDA: Bruce.

1028
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,200
He throws up his hands
to avoid the paint.

1029
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:22,271
His coat has one spot
of paint on it,
10 feet away.

1030
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,012
This is an exact copy if
the coat Mr. Spector wore

1031
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,882
on the night
of the shooting,
with a replica

1032
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:37,086
of the blood spatter--
4 spots and 2 pinpricks--

1033
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,521
of blood on the coat.

1034
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,424
You're free to examine it
if you wish.

1035
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,335
Here is what happens
to somebody standing

1036
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,439
within arm's length
of such an explosion.

1037
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,975
When the shot comes
from inside the mouth,

1038
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,043
the brain explodes.

1039
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,481
When the skull is intact,
as here, the brain matter

1040
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:12,088
the blood, is ejected through
the nose and the mouth.

1041
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:16,325
It seems to me Mr. Spector had
to have been standing a minimum

1042
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,129
of 10 feet from the event for
him to have avoided being

1043
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:25,234
painted--painted with brain
matter and blood.

interview.

RONNIE: I believe--I believe
that Phil at one time

1048
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:42,285
was very much like you or me,
and at the start--at the start

1049
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,056
of his career he was
talented and devoted

1050
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,926
a very serious musician.

1051
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,131
But as the press began to write
about him as a great, an icon,

1052
00:48:55,165 --> 00:49:01,904
or a genius, he began, yes,
to be affected by it

1053
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,575
and it affected him horribly,
like a drug,

1054
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,011
for it confused him.

1055
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:13,282
He was tormented--not by
the adulation, no, but by

1056
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:18,354
the question--is it true,
or is it deserved,

00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,957
35 years in
forensics.

1113
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,258
Exactly.

1114
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,260
Now, in your career
you have investigated...

1115
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,597
Over 10,000 instances
of gunshot wounds.

1116
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,031
Fatal.

1117
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,600
Yes, gunshot wounds
to the head.

1118
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,237
Good. And then
they show you
the diagram,

1119
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,705
and they say,
have you ever...

1120
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,941
in 35 years, that wound,
the angle of that wound

1121
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,510
is absolutely
inconsistent with any

1122
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,178
but a self-inflicted
wound.

1123
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,246
I'd put it simpler.

1124
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,714
I don't understand.

1125
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,484
I would say, "I've only
ever seen that as
a self-inflicted wound."

1126
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,485
That's right.

1127
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,320
In 95%, that is
a self-inflic--

1128
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,356
No. Dr. Spitz, you
cannot say 95%.

1129
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,557
I beg your pardon.

1130
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,691
I was just using that
as a figure of speech.
90--

1131
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,026
Shh, shh.

1132
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,030
Good, but you know, to the
prosecution, you say 95%,

1133
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,200
on cross-examination
you've just admitted that
there's a 5% chance

1134
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,968
that it is not
a self-inflicted wound.

1135
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,704
Is there a 5% chance that
somebody else shot her?

1136
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,705
There is no chance.

1137
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,474
Then do not say 95%.

1138
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,576
That was just
a figure of speech.

1139
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,712
Sure, Dr. Spitz, but you've
seen 10,000 case, right?

1140
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,348
5% of which,
the prosecution will
point out,

1141
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:11,554
is 500 cases in which
that is not a
self-inflicted wound.

1142
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,989
It is a self-
inflicted wound.

1143
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,659
The we require you
to so testify.

1144
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,129
Now, Dr. Spitz, we're
gonna take a look at
the bullet itself.

1145
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,463
Yes.

1146
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,041
BRUCE: That's good
if they let you use it.

1147
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,175
What?

1148
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,176
Oh, the tape?

1149
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,544
Mm-hmm.

1150
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,613
LINDA: No, no.
I'm not planning on
using the tape.

1151
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,248
No. Listen, it is
impossible

1152
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,950
that Philip
took that shot.

1153
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,085
If he had, his coat,
his hair, his
everything

1154
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,954
would have been
covered in blood.

1155
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,856
We've got to break
that thought into
the jury's mind--

1156
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,425
he could not
have done it.

1157
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,759
So you don't show them
the tape?

1158
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,629
No. No. I'm gonna
build it.

1159
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,398
BRUCE: Uh-huh.

1160
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,435
I'm gonna build
a bulletproof
Plexiglas chamber

1161
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,271
and put it
in the courtroom.

1162
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,574
I'm gonna put the wound
dummy in the chair

1163
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,711
and a ballistics tech in
a lab coat and have him
pull the trigger.

1164
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,481
When they see the booth
and the coat, everything
covered in blood,

1165
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,517
the jury sees that, we
just broke their thought
processes.

1166
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,685
We won the case.

1167
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,320
The judge will never
allow that.

1168
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,489
"Culpepper
v. Volkswagen."

1169
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,091
I've got a hearing
tomorrow at noon.

1170
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,125
She shot herself.

1171
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,360
You bet she did.

1172
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,828
Why?

1173
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,298
Not our problem anymore.

1174
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,200
It's been decided
it's inadmissible.

1175
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,735
PHIL: What does
that mean?

1176
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,004
LINDA: It means you can't
legally base a demonstration

1177
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,438
on a theory.

1178
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,874
You know what? Why don't
they get a carpenter
in there?

1179
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,843
Get a carpenter
in there,
build me a coffin,

1180
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,177
have the judge
nail me in.

1181
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,178
Philip.

1182
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,179
Get it over with.

1183
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,648
Philip,
the California law--

1184
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:46,982
They see that
demonstration,

1185
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,350
I walk out of there
free.

1186
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,287
It's been decided the
judge will--and can legally

1187
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,921
disallow it.

1188
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,024
Therefore, to make
a request doomed
to failure is--

1189
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,692
Why would I kill
that girl?

1190
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,427
Why?

1191
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,698
Because she wouldn't
what?

1192
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,899
She wouldn't what?

1193
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,534
She would have done
anything I asked.

1194
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,770
That's why she came
here.

1195
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,838
No. So forget why.

1196
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,073
How?

1197
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,308
What did I do?
What did I say?

1198
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,509
"Here.

1199
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,779
"You hold the gun and
you put it in your
mouth.

Why?

Because I want to prove
my power.

1203
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:25,454
My power was she got in
the car.

1204
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,022
That was my power.

1205
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:32,828
Some wretched,
stunted Jewish kid,
a poor kid,

00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,147
What if it were
an accident?

1268
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,120
Ah.

1269
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,154
Thank you for coming today.

1270
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,189
Thank you.

1271
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,624
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.

1272
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,758
Good.

1273
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,859
My name is Michael
Brown.

1274
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,028
Jenny O'Brien.

1275
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,863
BROWN: I'm a retired
federal officer.

1276
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,199
I've spent most of
my government service
occupied with

1277
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,501
ballistics, which is
the study of projectiles

1278
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,137
and firearms.

1279
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:08,076
This is a model
of a firearm, a revolver.

1280
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,347
As you see, it cannot
fire anything.

1281
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,883
There is nothing
to fire.

1282
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,953
It's solid plastic.
That's all it is.

1283
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,957
This model--I won't
call it a toy, because
it's not a toy--

1284
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,892
is designed for purposes
of demonstration.

1285
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,394
OK?

1286
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,495
Mmm.

1287
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:31,266
Basically...it's
a garage door opener.

1288
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,269
Now, here is one
thing this model
can do.

1289
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:38,840
If the trigger is
depressed, it sends
a signal...

1290
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,975
[Alarm sounds]

1291
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,544
The light and
the alarm go off.

1292
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,082
You all received your
checks for coming in
today?

1293
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,250
Yes.

1294
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,818
Fine.

1295
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,688
In addition to your
honorarium, in addition
to that,

1296
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,425
if you can insert the model
in your mouth without
pulling the trigger,

1297
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,760
you'll receive $300.

1298
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,362
You understand?

1299
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,599
Yeah.

1300
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,067
Wrapped in plastic.

1301
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,169
Completely sterile.

1302
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,038
Please remove it
from the plastic.

1303
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:19,014
Now without pulling
the trigger,

1304
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,750
insert the model
in your mouth.

1305
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,886
Close it.

1306
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,489
JAMES: For God's sakes,
what the fuck
are you doing?!

1307
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,024
Take it out!
Take it out of your mouth!

1308
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,994
[Alarm ringing]

1309
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:40,268
That's our case.

1310
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,737
And what does
forensics say?

1311
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,740
Forensics says the gun
was inside her mouth,

1312
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,175
handle and trigger guard
down, which means that

1313
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,510
the front sight was up.

1314
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,147
Now, somebody yells, "Take
that gun out of your mouth."

1315
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,082
She pulls it out fast.

1316
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:57,085
The front sight gets caught
on her upper teeth,

1317
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,921
hand keeps pulling,
depresses the trigger,
the gun goes off.

1318
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:00,989
It's not in
evidence.

1319
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,157
I'll put it
in the closing.

1320
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,492
It's too late.
I'll tell you
why.

1321
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,427
Everybody at that
point assumes that
he's guilty.

1322
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,596
Linda, all of this,
the rubber gun?

1323
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,564
I won't take the rubber
gun to court.

1324
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,099
Linda...

1325
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,968
It's so clear.
The judge didn't allow
Clarkson's diary.

1326
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,202
he won't allow--

1327
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,171
Linda, the point is,
all right,

1328
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,440
they think he's
a monster.

1329
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,841
You take the skull in,
they're sure.

1330
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,743
Monster. Lives in a
cave. Look at the skull.

1331
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,845
They turn away from your
client and his evidence.

1332
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,047
I make them
look at it.

1333
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,581
You're thrashing,
Linda.

1334
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,417
I'm telling you that
if she put the gun
in her own mouth--

1335
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,685
and she did--

1336
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,887
And I am telling you,
the only way you can
introduce

1337
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,722
all this fucking
Ben-Hur

1338
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,324
is in support of
direct testimony.

1339
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,694
Remember procedure,
which testimony only
comes and could come

1340
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:42,397
on direct from
Mr. Spector.

1341
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,865
Are you gonna put him
on the stand,

1342
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,501
or should I just fucking
go jump under a train.

1343
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,136
What?

1344
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,377
BRUCE: Take care of
yourself.

1345
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,285
PHIL: Thank you,
Ben.

1346
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,754
People say diet
is bullshit.

1347
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:06,955
Diet is not
bullshit.

1348
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,224
I want to talk to you
about tomorrow.

1349
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,325
What's this?

1350
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,461
LINDA: That's
a note from Bruce.

1351
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,129
A note?

1352
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,937
"My personal
numbers" in case
of what?

1353
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,207
In the case
you need him.

1354
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,541
These numbers are
in New York.

1355
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,676
Yeah. Well, Bruce
went back.

1356
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,677
Look here.

1357
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,112
This is the statement--

1358
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,713
Bruce went back
to New York?

1359
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,448
Yeah, sure. You knew
he was going back.

1360
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,750
To do his
television show.

1361
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,152
No. He didn't go back
to do his television show.

1362
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,221
He left me to do--

1363
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,522
Philip.

1364
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,758
Philip, you told him
you didn't wish him to--

1365
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,392
do you recall
the closing?

1366
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,129
You agreed,
the judge agreed that
Bruce could retire

1367
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,163
before the closing.

1368
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,664
Retire from
the case?

1369
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,932
Yes. Well,
you agreed.

1370
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,334
What, I agreed?
What do you mean,
I agreed?

1371
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:56,171
I agreed to what?
I agreed to what?

1372
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,339
It's relevant to this?

1373
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,107
No, no, no, no.

1374
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,475
No. This is unethical.

1375
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,011
He withdrew in open
court, Philip.
You were there.

1376
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,713
I didn't understand.

1377
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,747
Well, you
discussed this.

1378
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,017
When I paid him
$1 million

1379
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,318
to defend my life?

1380
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,121
You and the judge
and Bruce Cutler, remember?

1381
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,356
You all talked
about this.

1382
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,359
I thought he was going
on a trip. Come on!

1383
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,594
"These are my
New York numbers"?

1384
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,695
He has other clients.

1385
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,897
He left me.

1386
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,132
He left me to do
his television show.

1387
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,400
Don't break my heart.

1388
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:30,472
And I paid him
$1 million, and I
foolishly expected

1389
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,974
from him, loyalty.

1390
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,476
For--for what?

1391
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,477
For life?

1392
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,778
No.

1393
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,682
For the duration
of a trial, in which

1394
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,685
he pleaded with me
to give him the job.

1395
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,686
Why did he want
the job?

1396
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,821
Why?

1397
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,155
Because he liked me?

1398
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,824
He despised me.

1399
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,060
He wanted the job
because I needed him,

1400
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,362
because I was weak.

1401
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,064
He was strong.

1402
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,900
He wanted my money.

1403
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,101
I don't understand
that?

1404
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,138
Philip, you agreed
in front of a judge--

1405
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,706
I thought he was
going shopping.

1406
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,674
Please.

1407
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,108
Who was there to
tell me different?

1408
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,244
Who? Who could have?
I'm ignorant.

1409
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,745
What do I know
about these things?

1410
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,015
Who could have sat me
down and told me and
explained it to me?

1411
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,016
Who?

1412
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,484
My lawyer.

1413
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,519
That's who.

1414
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,520
Who's gone.

1415
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,589
You let him go.

1416
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,199
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you're upset.

1417
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,536
I know you are.

1418
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,670
So.

1419
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,274
What do we do now?

1420
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,644
If you testify,
we get to do

1421
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,112
the demonstrations.

1422
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,280
I don't get that.

1423
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,483
That means I've got
to put you on the stand.

1424
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:49,551

telling the truth.

It's certainly not
all right, Philip.

You might want to

Shut up, Philip.

You know the
difference between

1615
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,985
your different
behaviors.

1616
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,322
I act the same
with everyone.

1617
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,990
No, nobody does.

1618
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,358
You didn't act the
same around your
bands.

1619
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,260
You didn't act
the same around
the Beatles

1620
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,128
like you did with
an autograph-seeker.

1621
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,164
You can control
your behavior.

1622
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,799
Why is this
important?

1623
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,000
Because if you
don't,

1624
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:22,437
you're going to jail
for the rest
of your life.

1625
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,871
The prosecution is
gonna do everything

1626
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,973
in its power
to enrage you

1627
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,277
because that's all
they have.

1628
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,245
That is what we are
doing here today.

1629
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,083
They have no facts.
They have to break
you.

1630
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,118
You see, if you go
off, the jury will
say,

1631
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,721
"He did it now.
I'm sure he
did it then,"

1632
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,055
and they'll put you
away.

1633
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,757
I had no trouble
with the Beatles.

1634
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,126
And you will have no
trouble with the
D.A.

1635
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,695
if you recall that
you want something
from him

1636
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,265
and you will go
free.

1637
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,369
Now, I want
something from you.

1638
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,971
I want you to give
up the pills,
give up the wine

1639
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,973
for the 2 or 3 days
you'll be on the
stand

1640
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,508
and keep your
composure,

1641
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,676
just like you did
around the Beatles.

1642
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,312
I mean, if Paul
disagreed with you,

1643
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:05,413
did you scream at
him?

1644
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,115
On "Let It Be"?

1645
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,017
I was proved right.

1646
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,887
And you will be
proved right here

1647
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,922
if you keep
your composure.

1648
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,191
But if you don't,
you won't.

1649
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,929
I promise you that
I will be prepared
mentally,

1650
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,233
spiritually, and that
I will make a good
impression

01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:30,204

Why?

Not for what they
think of me, but what
you think of me.

You did an excellent
job.

1680
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:42,777
You were paid to
perform,

1681
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:46,347
and your performance
was perfect.

1682
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,884
So can I do as
well as you?

Tomorrow, we'll see.
