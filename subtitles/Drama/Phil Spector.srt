00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,231
What is this?

11
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,332
INTERVIEWER:
He's wearing a button
that says "back

12
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,033
to mono."

13
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,168
MAN ON VIDEO:
"Back to mono."

Yeah. All right.

"The wall of sound."

00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,173
All it is is, it's reverb.

17
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,374
You cook it down.

18
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,309
You mix it down time and again.

19
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,747
Oh, that reverb--what
it is is, it's mud. It's--

20
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,982
Good morning, Maggie.
Hello.

21
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,084
Excuse me. Could I have
a glass of water, please?

40 musicians,
20 hours a day,

26
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:43,462
working on one note--
one note...

27
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,430
until it's perfect.

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,732
Thank you.

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,267
Thank you very
much. [Laughs]

30
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,571
Not at all.
Not at all.

Wasn't much of
a singer, but..

MAN ON VIDEO: OK.
[Laughs]

35
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,546
Linda!

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,047
Where's she staying?
Someone!

37
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,482
Get her bags
to the hotel!

38
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,483
Get her installed.
whatever she needs!

MAGGIE: New York's
on the phone.

40
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,752
About what?

41
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,920
MAGGIE: Your
television show.

42
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,087
Television show--
it can wait.

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,589
The gun,
the blood spatter,

44
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,890
that whole wall.

45
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,793
Lana Clarkson, suicide threats,
depression--James,

46
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,861
you know what I'm
looking for.

47
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,629
Did they feed you
on the plane?

48
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,997
What do you think
I am--crazy?

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,232
Get her something
to eat.

50
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,568
I don't need
anything to eat.
I need a doctor.

51
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,669
Nick Stavros,

Linda Kenney Baden.

53
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,737
Hi. I won't touch you.
I'm very sick.

54
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,940
I need the case laws
on televised,

55
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,474
federal and California.

56
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,542
Grounds for exception,
grounds for appeal.

57
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,677
At least we can
slow them down.

58
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,644
Linda!

59
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,712
Could you get me
a cup of tea, please?

60
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,347
Here's the part
never cut in.

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,249

That was fantastic.

65
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,157
Some wonderful
material.

66
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,191
I'm so grateful
to you.

67
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,659
Oh, thank you.

68
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,660
INTERVIEWER:
Excellent.

69
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,697
Who is the girl
in the picture?

70
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,131
MAN IN VIDEO:
I don't know her name.

71
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,033
INTERVIEWER:
Phil didn't, either.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,702
Phil--he can attract
a girl?

73
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,738
Why not?
He can attract a girl.

74
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,573
He can get her
to his house.

75
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,842
Afterwards,
he's on his track.

76
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,377
How can he
keep her there?

77
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,812
You tell me.

78
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,046
With a gun.

79
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,749
He thinks he has to
have a gun..

80
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,051
INTERVIEWER: I think
we've covered just
about everything.

81
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,052
Ah.

82
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,120
INTERVIEWER:
Some questions at...

83
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,289
OK. All right, all right.

84
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,857
Linda, please.

85
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,694
Come on. We've got
3 days' worth to do
in half an hour.

86
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,597
MAN ON VIDEO:
..how far this goes back.

87
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,598
To the desert.

88
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,700
to the moors...

89
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,403
Thank you for coming.

90
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,404
You said that.

"Telegraph," London,
fax to Phil.

Day of the shooting.

00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,642
"Lost genius of
rock 'n' roll".

94
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,343
Yeah, I know
about the article.

95
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,778
What you
don't know--
read the article--

96
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,613
he's been cold sober
for 10 years.

97
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,682
Cold sober.
That night,
House of Blues

98
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,683
and Lana Clarkson.

99
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,651
Uh-huh.

100
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,685
Article
sets him off.

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,253
Hmm. That's a shame.

102
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,655
It sets him off.

103
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,456
Yes, but how does that
help your case?

104
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,225
My case, in court
tomorrow, all right?

105
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,994
How does it help your
case that he's nuts
and he's drunk?

106
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,230
He still put the gun
in the girl's mouth.

107
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,831
We've got
right there...

108
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:00,932
Yeah, I read that.

109
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,702
Maggie, play her
the fucking audiotape,

110
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,703
First officers?

111
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,671
I read it.

112
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:06,672
I want you
to hear it.

113
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,673
Phil and the first
officers.

114
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,207
Let's go.
Uh.

115
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,809
PHIL: This piece of shit!

116
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,477
I don't know what
the fucking problem was,

117
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,413
but she certainly
had no right

118
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,650
to come to my fucking
castle and blow her
fucking head open!

119
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,951
I don't see the case.

120
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,820
No? He's drunk.
He's enraged.

121
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,156
He mouths off
to the cops.
Why is he enraged?

122
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,324
You heard it.

123
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,125
Is that a man who
just shot somebody?

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,394
That's hearsay. They'll
never allow it into court.

125
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,562
"The People vs. Cruz".

126
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,630
James?

127
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,731
"The People vs. Lou."

128
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,333
He put the gun
in the girl's mouth...

129
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,334
No.

130
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,768
He pulled
the trigger.

131
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,403
Where's the blood?
Where's the massive
blood spatter?

132
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,606
I don't know where
the massive blood
spatter is.

133
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,509
This is my vacation
in Venice--

134
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,312
first-class tickets,
5-star hotel.

135
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,914
You know, we have
a meeting with him
tonight.

136
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,915
Not me.

137
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,982
You're here.
Why are you here?

138
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,484
I do it for a living.

139
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,453
I'm listening.

140
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,123
62 grand worth
of a vacation.

141
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,692
My hourly rate,
out of the office,
door to door,

142
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,060
24 hours a day.

143
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,329
30 grand on top,
and I'll give you 3 days,

144
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,330
if that's any use to you.

145
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,566
Thank you.

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,034
So is that
any use to you?

147
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,168
You give me
your assessment.

148
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,470
And you put back
my vacation

149
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,905
and you pay for it.

150
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,208
Stop negotiating.

151
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,242
And I need a shot.

152
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,210
Will you find me a doctor?

153
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,078
James!

154
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,480
James, drive her
to the hotel.

155
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,414
A doctor when she
gets there.

156
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,649
You walk her
to the room.

157
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,784
LINDA: Other side have
those outtakes?

158
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,119
Not yet.

159
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,787
They're filing
to admit the testimony
of 5 women...

160
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:29,821
Yeah, I read the
Grand Jury testimony.

161
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,356
This is gonna
be your office.

162
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,658
Oh, 5 women.
Count them.

163
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,028
5 women on oath
before the Grand
Jury.

164
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,830
"He pulled a gun on me.
He wanted sex."

165
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,599
Cold sober for 10
years, and now he's
just getting--

166
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,201
Well, so what, Bruce?
You ever hear the phrase
"To hell with it?"

167
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,369
You've got a gun nut.

168
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,638
He goes around waving
loaded guns.

169
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,440
You've got 5 women
come out of the woodwork--

170
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,808
"He did the same
thing to me."

171
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,842
You've got the chauffeur.

172
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,411
The chauffeur
is on record--

173
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,679
"My boss came out:
I think I just
killed somebody."

174
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,181
Well, exclude
the woman.

175
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,182
How? On EWOL?

176
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,483
You bet.

177
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,619
No, I say the judge
allows it under Caitlyn.

178
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,821
In which case
it's reversible.

179
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,122
I'm doing a TV show.

180
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,657
Really? About the case?

181
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,125
No, independent of
the case.

182
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,193
Oh, great.

183
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,162
Now, the chauffeur.

184
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,464
Bruce, Bruce, Bruce,
he shot the girl.

185
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,999
He shot the girl, all right?

186
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,066
He's a freak.

187
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,668
Those are the public
who don't hate him.

188
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,236
He's a genius.

189
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,372
He transformed
the entire
music industry.

190

What's that--what's that
kid's name--James?

191
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,042
James. James?

192
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,612
I'm Linda Kenney
Baden.

193
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,314
Could you tell me
what this is?

194
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,383
I'll give you
a dollar if you can
tell me.

195
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,651
Is it something
to do with music?

196
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,852
Why would you
say that?

197
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,053
Because the case
has to do with music.

198
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,154
No, no, no.

199
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,589
The case has nothing
to do with music.

200
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,693
No. This is an insert
that allows a 45 RPM
record to be played

201
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,329
on an LP phonograph, OK?
Now...

202
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,330
OK.

203
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,865
What is this?

204
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,905
Something to do with
an early computer.

205
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,640
Mmm.

206
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:00,812
Put it on
your key chain.

207
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,681
It's a piece
of the past.

208
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,049
Mmm.

209
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,285
This kid doesn't know
what a phonograph is,

210
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,688
a 45, a--a transistor
radio.

211
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,791
Nobody on the jury
is gonna know anything
except your guy's

212
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,159
a murderer and a freak.

213
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,460
The girl killed herself.

214
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,329
Well, maybe, but
I don't want to take
that case.

215
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,396
There...

216
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,464
I don't like
that case.

217
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,899
There is no evidence.

218
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,300
There's no blood
spatter on his cuff.

219
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,436
Well, you've got--
as to the blood
spatter--

220
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,373
There is no blood spatter
on the back wall. Why?

221
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,474
Why?

222
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,144
Linda, the bullet
lodged in the skull.

223
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,446
The skull was intact.

224
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,881
All the blood
in the brain matter
had to come

225
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,683
out of the mouth
toward him.

226
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,285
Exact model of
the coat he wore.

227
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,386
Exact model.

228
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Blood spatter?

229
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,822
You find it. Go ahead.

230
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,091
It's more than
a pinpoint, Bruce.
I read the report.

231
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,425
It's more than one,
and--

232
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,161
And it is inconsistent with
anything but a defensive--

233
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,663
Bruce...

234
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,466
a defensive movement.
and the angle of the shot
is inconsistent.

235
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,700
The only way
he walks--

236
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,302
I think
he's not guilty.

237
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,238
Of course you do.
The only way, however,
that he walks is what?

238
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:01,573
She shot herself.

239
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,607
That's right. Why?

240
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,742
She was depressed.

241
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,010
We have a history
of e-mails, comments...

242
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,512
They let O.J. go.
They let Michael
Jackson go.

243
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,681
They are not gonna
let him go.

244
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,816
They will be trying him
for the murder of
O.J.'s wife,

245
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,286
and they will find him
guilty.

The girl was crazy,
Linda.

248
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,958
She made this tape
to promote herself
as an actress.

to attack the girl,

He changed the tune
as he came to me.

281

He's entitled
to a defense.

What would you tell
your students?

283

Would you say,
"Don't take the case

your sensibilities,"

or is he presumed
innocent?

286
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,931
Because you're
screwed up,

287

because you
read the same gossip
everybody else did,

so you think
he's guilty.

All right, they
think he's guilty.

Do you think he's
gonna give that up?

326
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,195
He's following

INTERVIEWER:
Mm-hmm.

330
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,536
The whole thing was about,
"How do I keep these
broads?"

331
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,605
But he didn't
want to keep them.

332
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,840
That's true.

333
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,108
Why?

334
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,275
Ha.

335

He didn't know
what love was.

336
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,380
He knew what
pussy was,

337
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,851
and that's as close
as he came.

your favorite of all

Fantastic. Yeah.

one of the greatest
recordings ever made.

At least, that's
what Phil would say.

So I suppose you

MAN ON VIDEO: Well,
it was the old days.

350
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,340
You know, you got to clip
everything, and it was mono,

8 track, live sound.

355
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,518
It was more realistic to be live

He says his father
shot himself
when he was 5,

365
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,826
but Philip was 5
in 1944.

366
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,594
He didn't shoot himself
when he was 5.

367
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,696
He killed himself
when Phil was 10--1949.

How? With a gun?

it's a matter of

there was still

I didn't want
to do it.

Just didn't
want to do it.

You didn't want to
do it? Why?

I'd done it.

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,566
The girls, the money,
the fame. No.

455

You know,

456
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,136
I thought I'd move
to Belize.

457
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,105
Is that a fantasy?

458
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,274
Everything I've done
in my life has been
a fantasy.

459
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,642
I made it happen.

460
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,111
I couldn't keep you here
by force

461
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,613

all my guns.

â™ª

escaped me that people
thought,

464
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:38,029
or were taught to think,
that I was a clown

465
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,664
or freak of some sort

466
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:45,603
and that my accomplishments
were somehow not to
be admired.

467
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,641
But in their breadth
of number,
the sign of a freak.

468
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,046
But I understand.

469
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,482
It's called "envy."

470
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,687
I believe it's even
mentioned in the Bible.

471
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:06,791
Extraordinary
accomplishments, Linda,

472
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,228
transforms the grateful
into an audience

473
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,566
and the envious, Linda,
into a mob.

474
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,701
You watch.

475
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,603
See if I'm not right.

476
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:24,308
It stems from a feeling
of inadequacy

477
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,712
which is a lack
of courage.

478
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,146
Yeah, I understand.

479
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:34,885
I had it, too, but
I dealt with it
by doing something.

480
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,754
You know?

481
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,856
What was I to do?

482
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,091
Did I tear anybody down?

483
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:43,794
No.

484
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,763
They were no threat to me.

485
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,032
I was too busy.

486
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,701
It's pretty, eh?

487
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:51,736
Hmm.

488
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,837
Here you go.

489
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,039
Thank you.

490
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,642
Why do you have
so many guns?

491
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,744
I might need one.

492
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,812
Why would you need
more than one?

493
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:02,813
I don't know.

494
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,148
How many pairs
of shoes do you
have?

495
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,182
Mmm.

496
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,151
How many feet?

497
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,320
But they're gone.

498
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,156
And I'm not going to
shoot you, so why don't
we sit down?

499
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,226
LINDA: Mmm. Thank you.

500
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,629
So how do you feel
about guns?

501
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,663
How do you feel
about them?

502
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,998
I can take them
or leave them.

503
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:25,302
Yeah, but if you
leave them and somebody
pulls one on you,

504
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,370
well, there you are--

505
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,006
Anybody ever pull
a gun on you?

506
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,674
You think I shot
the girl, Linda?

507
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,675
Hmm.

508
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,676
You're smart.

509
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,911
High praise, indeed.

510
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:34,945
You think I shot
the girl?

511
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,847
Your chauffer
is on record.

512
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:40,551
"My boss came out.
I think I just
killed somebody."

513
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,855
[Telephone beeps]

514
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:49,960
Tomorrow's "Times,"

515
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,898
today's "Times,"
you're quoted

516
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,333
as denouncing "the
Hitler-like D.A.

517
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,569
and his storm
trooper henchmen."

518
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,605
Do you let people
screw with you?

519
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,444
That's the white piano.
That's where John wrote
"Imagine."

520
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:12,082
Lenny, Lenny Bruce,
he would sit here
at the end,

521
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,617
talking about
the fourth
amendment.

522
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,953
That's how nuts
they had him at the end.

523
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:21,959
Shooting smack,
talking about the
commerce clause.

524
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,861
Wisest man
I ever met.

525
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,864
There's John,
John Lennon, clubbed up
with his wife at

526
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:32,136
the Dakota, prior to which
he was living in 2 1/2
rooms in the East Village,

527
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,140
head shaved,
hadn't bathed in
a year and a half.

528
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,675
This genius.

529
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,709
What's this?

530
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,044
Thank you, Vernon.

531
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,547
PHIL: Do we know him?

532
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,584
As your attorney,
I must counsel you not,

533
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:50,154
whatever the
provocation, not
to talk to anyone.

534
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:53,190
They're indicting me
for murder.

535
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,229
All right, sorry.

536
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,298
"You--You Lost That
Loving Feeling".

537
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,366
What was it?

538
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,401
Are you kidding me?

539
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,636
What was it?

540
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,940
It was--it was the
greatest song ever released.

541
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,911
I sold over 2.5
million copies.

542
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:16,080
You say the Jews
invented the music
business.

543
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,849
The Jews didn't invent
the music business.

544
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:19,984
I invented
the music business.

545
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,054
7th Avenue, New York,
there's a statue,

546
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,723
a little old
Jewish guy, yarmulke,

547
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,558
bent over
a sewing machine.

548
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,860
He's that guy who invented
ready to wear.

549
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,229
I invented
the music business.

550
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,664
Where's the statue of me?

551
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,835
Where's the
Presidential Medal?

552
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,340
â™ª

553
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,109
Sidney Poitier broke
the color barrier?

554
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,378
Are you kidding me?

555
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:50,047
He was playing Superman.

556
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,982
You want to know
who he was?

557
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:56,420
He was an uptight
frightened white guy's
version

558
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,755
of a black man.

559
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,390
I put the Ronettes
in their home.

560
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:03,827
I put black America
in the white home.

561
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,764
The first time you got
felt up, the first time

562
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,768
you got somebody's
hand on you--guess what.

563
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,369
You were listening
to one of my songs.

564
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,572
Did you kill
that girl?

565
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,641
I thought attorneys
never ask that question.

566
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,710
I'm the Christmas help.
I'm going home.

567
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,445
Ah.

568
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,948
"I think I just
killed somebody."

569
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:29,053
My chauffeur
at the time barely
spoke English.

570
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,222
I came out, having
seen what I saw,

571
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,827
and I said, "I think
I should call somebody."

572
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,196
Is that true,
Philip?

573
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,497
That's what my mother
used to call me.

574
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,000
Did you shoot her?

575
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,903
Lana Clarkson?

576
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,671
Listen. Listen.

577
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,772
Come.

578
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,242
Let me tell you about
Lana Clarkson.

579
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,546
All her life,
all she wanted

580
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,516
was this thing.

581
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:05,556
It was a drug.
She thought it was
called "fame,"

582
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,595
and to put here
in here, in Hollywood,
with this drug all around,

583
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,498
why don't you put
a diabetic in
a chocolate shop?

584
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,934
Why don't you hire
a recovering coke-head

585
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,304
to work in a meth lab?

586
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,340
Did Hollywood kill Marilyn?

587
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:29,313
She killed herself
with help from
an unfulfillable longing.

588
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:34,952
Or maybe she just got
drunk and lost count
of the pills.

589
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,854
Did you ever do that?

590
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,425
Lana Clarkson, at her death,
had more prescription

591
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,927
pharmaceuticals in her
than Walgreen's.

592
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,496
No, no.

593
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,665
The toxicology screens
showed she had only--

594
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:48,699
Bullshit. Bullshit!

595
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,901
I looked in her eyes!

596
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,203
She had the equivalent
of two Vicodin
and some antihistamine.

597
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:54,905
Come on,
the prosecution--

598
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,342
do you think I
don't know a hophead
when I see one?

599
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,410
.14.

600
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,178
All right, that's it.

601
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,980
She was gone.

602
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,014
Please.

603
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,049
Please.

604
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,119
I can't go on
about that stuff.

605
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,688
I'm done.

606
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,092
Gonna wear that
cross tomorrow?

607
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,165
It's a Mayan artifact.

608
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,400
I have a question, Linda.

609
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:27,638
If Jesus was so big,
why did they kill him?

610
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,906
Because he was
the son of God.

611
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,340
No!

612
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,476
Because he was still
the son of God.

613
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,678
"Still" is not news.

614
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,348
Somebody is "still"
the greatest beauty, actor,

615
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,452
record producer--
you can't put that
in the paper.

616
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:42,920
What is news, then?

617
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,223
News is that he likes
little boys,

618
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:50,561
that he's a thief,
that he cheats
on his wife.

619
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:54,565
Or in the absence
of any fault,
that he's just

620
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,834
too goddamn big
for his fucking britches,

621
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,571
which is why
they killed Christ.

622
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,906
See this here?

623
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,843
"You Lost That Loving
Feeling", this was--

624
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,445
this was the best
song ever released.

625
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
They told me it was
too long.

626
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,117
Came in at 4 minutes
and 5 seconds.

627
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:17,221
Nobody could release
a cut over 2 1/2 minutes.

628
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,089
So, what did I do?

629
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,425
I redid the labels.

630
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:26,263
"Running time 2 minutes,
48 seconds."

631
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,400
I didn't change
the length.
I changed the label.

632
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,104
They played it.
It made everybody rich.

633
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,775
It's not, Linda,
that you have to go
against the tide.

634
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:42,045
Some people--some people,
that's all they can do.

635
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,347
You understand?

636
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:48,852
Our friend Lawrence--
5'4", S&M freak.

637
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,990
Greatest general
that ever lived.

638
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,826
End of his life,
he retired,

639
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:01,064
Took on a false name,
enlisted as a private.

What did he want?

641
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,234
Money, fame?

642
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,603
They made him sick.

643
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,973
What he wanted was what
he had in the desert.

644
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,944
What he wanted
was privacy,
you understand?

00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,245
They say I'm
standoffish.

646

I'm not standoffish.

647

Is it--is it that
I don't like people?

I don't know.

651
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:31,161
I never spend
any time with them.

652
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:34,698
Ah. OK.

653

I can't even
do this for you.

My hands are
shaking.

658
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,977
I'm taking these drugs,
neuroleptic drugs.

659
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:53,183
And a side effect is,
it mimics MS.

It says he said,
"We should call somebody."

Yeah, well, that's what
he told me he said.

How do you get that
into the record?

Mm-hmm.

him of, "I just don't

Good morning,
everybody.

716
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,099
We spent a lot of
time over the last
few days

717
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,134
talking about what
you've read about

about the case,

what you know,
what you think you
know about the case.

720

This is my opportunity
to talk with you
for a few minutes

721
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,845
about what we expect
the evidence to show,
the actual facts

722
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,848
in the case, to show.

723
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,517
And that evidence,
ladies and gentlemen,

724
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:51,621
is going to paint
a very, very clear picture.

725
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,192
the picture of a man,
Philip Spector,

726
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,028
who, when he's confronted
with the right
circumstances,

727
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:00,797
when he's confronted
with the right situation,

You all right?
Yeah.

to paint a picture of a man

731
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:11,074
who on February 3, 2003,
put a loaded pistol
in Lana Clarkson's mouth

inside her mouth,
and shot her to death.

But to understand more
fully, more globally, why

735
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,356
Philip Spector would have done
what he did, how Lana Clarkson

fell victim to this man,
you're going to be
introduced to evidence

of the defendant's very
rich history of violence,

you had better tell me

all doubt, because I
do not like your guy.

00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,399
I thought you were
going back to New York.

798
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,868
I'm staying on
for the hotel food.

799
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,703
Get on board
because our case is

800
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,873
she's a suicidal pillhead,
and we have letters

801
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,209
and we have e-mails,
and we...

802
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:37,580
WITNESS: I turned around,
and there was a gun
pointing at me.

803
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:40,350
I said, "Stop that."

804
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,853
I said, "Put it down."

805
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,656
"Stop. Just--

806
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,991
Stop.

807
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:52,128
He was screaming,
"You're not going.

808
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,497
"I'm not unlocking the door.

809
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,132
"I'll blow you away.

810
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,801
I'll shoot you."

811
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:03,073
â™ª

812
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:10,413
Now--now how many of you
think he's guilty?

813
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:19,656
â™ª

814
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,626
What if, with all
the facts that seem to be
against him...

815
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:24,594
BRUCE: The girl fucking
shot herself.

816
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,697
WOMAN: What if we have
testimony

817
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:31,534
that he'd said in public--
that Phil Spector
had said in public

818
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,269
to Lana Clarkson...

819
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,437
REPORTER: You're
on record as
saying

820
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,140
you're never
happy unless
you're unhappy.

821
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,274
Yeah.

822
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,442
So does that make me
so unusual?

823
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,577
Mr. Spector?

824
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,480
How many millions
of people..

825
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,849
That's good, and
how many millions--

826
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,551
Freud was, God bless him,

827
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,689
essentially
a confidence man.

828
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,725
He didn't invent a cure.
He invented a disease.

829
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,793
MAN: Phil!
PHIL: Yeah?

830
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,429
MAN: Where do you
want it from?

831
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,232
PHIL: Take it from
measure 14.

832
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,868
REPORTER: Freud said
there was no cure but
that perhaps

833
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,370
he could transform
unbearable
unhappiness

834
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,039
into simple human
misery.

835
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,775
PHIL: Jack Daniels
can do that.

836
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,510
MAN: Phil, where
do you want it from?

837
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,511
PHIL: Oh, man.

838
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,812
A job can do that.

839
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,247
Please, guys!

840
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,615
What are you guys
doing, man?

841
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,117
Hey, malingerers,
what do you want?

842
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,820
You want one of them
lounge chairs, floats
in your pool?

843
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,088
When did this
come in?

844
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,089
PHIL: A little...

845
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,123
We just got that.

846
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,458
PHIL: Are you cold?

847
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,193
Listen, you want to
rest, go ahead.

848
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:33,163
Rest until you feel like
picking it up

849
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,197
at measure 14.

850
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,198
I don't care.

851
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,166
Let me know.

852
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
REPORTER:
You know, Freud--

853
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,201
Freud?

854
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,769
What's Freud gonna do?

855
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,138
What is he gonna do--
change the past?

856
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,907
Tell the fucking client
to indulge his feelings?

857
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,243
I--you know what
I say? No.

858
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,646
If he's got the courage,
let the guy go out

859
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,114
and make something
of his life.

860
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,182
It can be done, you know?

861
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,349
MAN: Phil, where
do you want it from?

862
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,552
Yeah? Yeah. Oh, Barry,
what do you want?

863
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,287
BARRY: You want it
from measure 14?

864
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,222
PHIL: No, you know
what I want?

865
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,225
I want you motherfuckers--
I'm coming.

866
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:03,893
Hold on a minute,
all right?

867
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:07,697
Here you go. Hey.

868
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,698
We'll be with you
in a minute. Don't worry.

869
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,966
MAN: Don't
be stupid--

870
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,403
PHIL: OK, motherfuckers.

871
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,506
I told you you should
finish college, huh?

872
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,175
Join the Marines, anything
rather than throw yourself

873
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,710
on my...

874
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,878
MAN: Phil, OK--

875
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:22,979
PHIL: boundless mercy.

876
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,848
Right?

877
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,451
Take you in from
the cold--and you
know I did.

878
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,755
You should consider it
a mercy I killed
a lot of you,

879
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,691
save you the shame,
Walter, of ruining

880
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,460
this simple fucking song.

881
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,528
[Gunshot]

882
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,998
MUSICIAN: Oh! What--

883
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:42,999
REPORTER: Oh,
my goodness.

884
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,834
Send out for Chinese.

885
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,903
We're gonna be here a while.

886
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:51,407
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
See that?

887
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,343
Lesson learned.

888
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,012
OK, pretty.
We're ready for you. Mwah.

889
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,614
Oh, you moved.

890
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,615
Where were you?

891
00:41:58,649 --> 00:41:59,649
Ha.

892
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,617
PHIL: Let me see.
Oh, yeah.

893
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,618
Here you go.

894
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,319
Thank you.

895
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,622
Let him go out and
do something with his life.

896
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,323
MUSICIAN: Phil,
what do you want?

897
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:13,029
Uh, play till the lemon
chicken comes.

898
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,030
[Linda coughs]

899
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,865
You're sick?

900
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
End of a case,
if you're not sick,

901
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,034
you're not working
hard enough.

902
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,802
It's not the end
of the case.

903
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,970
You're killing yourself.

904
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,772
Oh, what? I wish I could
say the same for you.

905
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,940
I was in New York.

906
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,642
My caseload
is not lim--

907
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,911
I have clients I left
in New York, all right?

908
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,279
LINDA: Hmm.

909
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,513
BRUCE: What is it
you love this guy,

910
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,248
all of a sudden you're
working yourself to death?

911
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,349
LINDA: He's our client!

912
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,851
BRUCE: Oh, that's right.
You told me.

913
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,185
He covered you
with a blanket.

914
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,253
WOMAN: Here you go.
BRUCE: You're a cheap date.

915
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,755
LINDA: Oh, fuck
you, Bruce.

916
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,490
You've got a case
that should have
been thrown out.

917
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,359
The cops and the DA
are trying him
on the O.J. case.

918
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,827
The prosecution
has nothing.

919
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,863
BRUCE: Except everyone's
conviction that he's guilty.

920
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,331
LINDA: We've got
ballistic evidence.

921
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,167
They trot up
their experts;
we trot up ours.

922
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,503
At the end of the day
the jury finds him guilty,

923
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,705
and we have wasted
their time--

924
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,040
unless we indict
the girl.

925
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,675
Is he guilty?

926
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,511
Not beyond a reasonable
doubt, but why don't you
just show the yokels

927
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,581
your two-toned shirts,
your cufflinks,
fix your tie,

928
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,050
and say the law protects
all equally?

929
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,251
Is that untrue?

930
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,719
It's true if you win.

931
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,621
Not true for freaks.

932
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,156
But for him,
off he goes.

933
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,058
Is that what this
is about--freaks?

934
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,025
Very good, Bruce.

935
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,126
That's right.
That's right.

936
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,929
It's all about me.
It's about me.

937
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,898
You know, the poor geek,
the bookworm--

938
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,266
she gets judged
in the schoolyard,

939
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,135
doesn't get a fair
trial, except our
guy does,

940
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,472
and the facts do not
support a conviction.

941
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,140
I don't give a shit
who he is.

942
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,876
I don't give a shit
what he's done before.

943
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,414
OK.

944
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,418
Marvin Gaye--his father
shot him, right?

945
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:47,523
Sam Cooke...in bed
with some girl,
husband comes home,

946
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,625
bam, bam, bam!

947
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,827
End of story.

948
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,462
Who gives a shit?

949
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:56,499
Lana Clarkson shot herself.
I was there.

950
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,936
Now they're treating
me worse than they treated
Mark David Chapman.

951
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,872
His name plate reads
"What a shame,"

952
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,440
and he shot John Lennon.

953
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,309
And I, who happened
to be in the same room

954
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:12,081
when this girl
shot herself,

955
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,351
I am a monster the likes
of which never saw

956
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,687
the light of day.

957
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,424
You--you want to explain
that to me?

958
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,427
So, what is it, then?

959
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,462
What are we talking
about here?

960
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,097
Hatred.

961
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,033
What do they hate
about me?

962

I'm alive.

You know the saying
"The good die young," right?

964

Why?

965
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,046
Because the file
is closed.

966
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,016
REPORTER: I understand.
Have you said that--

967
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,852
This is the story.

968
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,654
The girl exceeded
her shelf life.

969
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,624
She's in L.A.
She's down on her luck.
She is broke.

970
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,625
Spector didn't help her?

971
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,893
That's not his job.

972
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:57,894
You're thinking
of Christ.
He's not Christ.

973
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,396
He's a guy. He
wanted affirmation.

974
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,397
He wanted sex.

975
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,332
68-year-old guy.
It's the same thing.

976
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,367
What is he--
pussy-crazed?

977
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,602
OK, she's working
in some bar.

978
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,738
A guy comes in.
She brushes him off.

979

The boss says,
"Do you know
who that is?"

980
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,208
So, what we have
is a car crash.

981
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,209
She's lonely.

982
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,610
What is she
supposed to do?

983

"Please help me.
I'm lonely"?

Wait, wait, wait,

arguing my case?

kill that girl?

Who are these women?

These women come out and say
I pulled a gun on them.

994
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,834
Where were they at the time
of the supposed offense?

995
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,970
No. They came out
of the woodwork years later.

996
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,004
They came out
at the time.

997
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,339
No. Bullshit.

998
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,876
They--no. They didn't even
press their case. Come on!

999
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,412
They came out when
it was in their interest
to come out--

1000
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,648
they came out when there was
something in it for them.

1001
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,183
What was in it?
Publicity.

1002
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,284
What did Lana Clarkson want?

1003
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,452
Publicity.

1004
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,620
What do they all want?

1005
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,556
People--people think
it's contagious--

1006
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,227
you can get it by hanging
around someone

1007
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,661
who's got it.

1008

I would have helped--

00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,300
why not?

1010
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,471
came in here and ruined my life
by sticking a gun

1011
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,007
in her mouth.

1012
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,276
For--for what?

1013
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,779
For what?

1014
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,080
For what is this
retribution?

1015
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,083
For what am I
being punished?

1016
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,553
For being the most
successful music producer

1017
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,522
in the history
of the world.

1018
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,423
And if you think
that's bullshit,

1019
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,660
then you're not
as smart as I know you are.

1020
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:46,469
I am--I am so sorry
that that girl,

1021
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,406
that her life
was full of suffering.

1022
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,544
I'm sorry she died.

1023
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,445
I didn't do it.

1024
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,451
The State says
the gun was in her mouth.

1025
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,754
If he were 10 feet away,
could he have done it?

BRUCE: The prosecution says
you didn't go to her,
you didn't touch her.

1027

LINDA: Bruce.

1028
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,200
He throws up his hands
to avoid the paint.

1029
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:22,271
His coat has one spot
of paint on it,
10 feet away.

1030
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,012
This is an exact copy if
the coat Mr. Spector wore

1031
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,882
on the night
of the shooting,
with a replica

1032
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:37,086
of the blood spatter--
4 spots and 2 pinpricks--

1033
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,521
of blood on the coat.

1034
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,424
You're free to examine it
if you wish.

1035
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,335
Here is what happens
to somebody standing

1036
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:56,439
within arm's length
of such an explosion.

1037
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,975
When the shot comes
from inside the mouth,

1038
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:01,043
the brain explodes.

1039
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:05,481
When the skull is intact,
as here, the brain matter

1040
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:12,088
the blood, is ejected through
the nose and the mouth.

1041
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:16,325
It seems to me Mr. Spector had
to have been standing a minimum

1042
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,129
of 10 feet from the event for
him to have avoided being

1043
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:25,234
painted--painted with brain
matter and blood.

interview.

RONNIE: I believe--I believe
that Phil at one time

1048
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:42,285
was very much like you or me,
and at the start--at the start

1049
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,056
of his career he was
talented and devoted

1050
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,926
a very serious musician.

1051
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,131
But as the press began to write
about him as a great, an icon,

1052
00:48:55,165 --> 00:49:01,904
or a genius, he began, yes,
to be affected by it

1053
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,575
and it affected him horribly,
like a drug,

1054
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,011
for it confused him.

1055
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:13,282
He was tormented--not by
the adulation, no, but by

1056
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:18,354
the question--is it true,
or is it deserved,

00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,920
Oh, yeah. We will
add your
publication.

1112
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,957
35 years in
forensics.

1113
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,258
Exactly.

1114
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,260
Now, in your career
you have investigated...

1115
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,597
Over 10,000 instances
of gunshot wounds.

1116
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,031
Fatal.

1117
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,600
Yes, gunshot wounds
to the head.

1118
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,237
Good. And then
they show you
the diagram,

1119
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,705
and they say,
have you ever...

1120
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,941
in 35 years, that wound,
the angle of that wound

1121
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,510
is absolutely
inconsistent with any

1122
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,178
but a self-inflicted
wound.

1123
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,246
I'd put it simpler.

1124
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,714
I don't understand.

1125
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:35,484
I would say, "I've only
ever seen that as
a self-inflicted wound."

1126
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,485
That's right.

1127
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,320
In 95%, that is
a self-inflic--

1128
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,356
No. Dr. Spitz, you
cannot say 95%.

1129
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,557
I beg your pardon.

1130
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,691
I was just using that
as a figure of speech.
90--

1131
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,026
Shh, shh.

1132
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,030
Good, but you know, to the
prosecution, you say 95%,

1133
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:51,200
on cross-examination
you've just admitted that
there's a 5% chance

1134
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:52,968
that it is not
a self-inflicted wound.

1135
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,704
Is there a 5% chance that
somebody else shot her?

1136
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:56,705
There is no chance.

1137
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,474
Then do not say 95%.

1138
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,576
That was just
a figure of speech.

1139
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,712
Sure, Dr. Spitz, but you've
seen 10,000 case, right?

1140
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,348
5% of which,
the prosecution will
point out,

1141
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:11,554
is 500 cases in which
that is not a
self-inflicted wound.

1142
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,989
It is a self-
inflicted wound.

1143
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,659
The we require you
to so testify.

1144
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,129
Now, Dr. Spitz, we're
gonna take a look at
the bullet itself.

1145
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,463
Yes.

1146
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:32,041
BRUCE: That's good
if they let you use it.

1147
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,175
What?

1148
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,176
Oh, the tape?

1149
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,544
Mm-hmm.

1150
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,613
LINDA: No, no.
I'm not planning on
using the tape.

1151
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,248
No. Listen, it is
impossible

1152
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,950
that Philip
took that shot.

1153
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,085
If he had, his coat,
his hair, his
everything

1154
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,954
would have been
covered in blood.

1155
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,856
We've got to break
that thought into
the jury's mind--

1156
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,425
he could not
have done it.

1157
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,759
So you don't show them
the tape?

1158
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,629
No. No. I'm gonna
build it.

1159
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,398
BRUCE: Uh-huh.

1160
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,435
I'm gonna build
a bulletproof
Plexiglas chamber

1161
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,271
and put it
in the courtroom.

1162
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,574
I'm gonna put the wound
dummy in the chair

1163
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,711
and a ballistics tech in
a lab coat and have him
pull the trigger.

1164
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,481
When they see the booth
and the coat, everything
covered in blood,

1165
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,517
the jury sees that, we
just broke their thought
processes.

1166
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,685
We won the case.

1167
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,320
The judge will never
allow that.

1168
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,489
"Culpepper
v. Volkswagen."

1169
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,091
I've got a hearing
tomorrow at noon.

1170
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,125
She shot herself.

1171
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,360
You bet she did.

1172
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,828
Why?

1173
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,298
Not our problem anymore.

1174
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,200
It's been decided
it's inadmissible.

1175
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,735
PHIL: What does
that mean?

1176
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,004
LINDA: It means you can't
legally base a demonstration

1177
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:36,438
on a theory.

1178
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,874
You know what? Why don't
they get a carpenter
in there?

1179
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,843
Get a carpenter
in there,
build me a coffin,

1180
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,177
have the judge
nail me in.

1181
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,178
Philip.

1182
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,179
Get it over with.

1183
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,648
Philip,
the California law--

1184
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:46,982
They see that
demonstration,

1185
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:48,350
I walk out of there
free.

1186
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,287
It's been decided the
judge will--and can legally

1187
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,921
disallow it.

1188
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,024
Therefore, to make
a request doomed
to failure is--

1189
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,692
Why would I kill
that girl?

1190
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,427
Why?

1191
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,698
Because she wouldn't
what?

1192
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,899
She wouldn't what?

1193
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,534
She would have done
anything I asked.

1194
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,770
That's why she came
here.

1195
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,838
No. So forget why.

1196
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,073
How?

1197
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,308
What did I do?
What did I say?

1198
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,509
"Here.

1199
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,779
"You hold the gun and
you put it in your
mouth.

1200
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,614
I'll pull the trigger."

1201
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,648
Why?

1202
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,251
Because I want to prove
my power.

1203
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:25,454
My power was she got in
the car.

1204
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,022
That was my power.

1205
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:32,828
Some wretched,
stunted Jewish kid,
a poor kid,

1206
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,698
who could have, over the
years, any fucking woman
I wanted--

1207
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,133
oh, I'm gonna throw my
life away for her.

1208
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,168
Why not?

1209
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,936
She was a cocktail
waitress.

1210
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,741
In the old days,
the cops,
they showed up,

1211
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,210
she shot herself, they
throw her in jail

1212
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,145
for fucking up my
evening,

1213
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,513
dead as she was.

1214
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:52,715
I want you to put me
on the stand.

1215
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,516
LINDA: One-way
ticket to the
gallows.

1216
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:58,287
I want to tell
what happened.

1217
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,788
What happened?

1218
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,057
You got 12 seconds?

1219
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,893
â™ª

1220
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:09,832
I was drunk.
She was screwed up
out of her mind.

1221
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,800
I took her home.

1222
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,269
She asked me--
she asked me

1223
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,439
did I have any guns
around the house?

1224
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:23,445
I said, "Why?"
She said, "I find
it exciting."

1225
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,647
Many women do.

1226
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,851
So I showed her
the guns,

1227
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,120
I went in the other
room, I came back.

1228
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,056
She's got a gun in her
hand, and she's smiling

1229
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,660
provocatively, right?

1230
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:42,564
She takes the stupid
gun, puts it in her
mouth.

1231
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,767
I scream, "No!"

1232
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,104
The gun goes off.

1233
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:54,643
â™ª

1234
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,817
LINDA: It's interesting.

1235
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:04,653
PHIL: What?

1236
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,688
The various looks,

1237
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,890
the wigs.

1238
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,927
A lot of people
think they're wigs.

1239
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,462
That's called
prejudice.

1240
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:18,534
â™ª

1241
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,157
Brindon, where are they?

1242
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,192
They have gone.

1243
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,760
We must tell Torvald.

1244
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,894
He was with them.

1245
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,329
No.

1246
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,264
BRINDON: Shall I
alert Princess Isa?

1247
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,134
No. Better to take
a dagger through the heart,

1248
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,669
for the news would
kill her.

1249
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:54,670
Brindon...

1250
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,873
95%. Unbelievable.

1251
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,244
LINDA: My boss came out
of the house and said,

1252
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:04,046
"I think I just
killed somebody."

1253
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,848
"I think I should call
somebody"?

1254
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,816
You want to know
the case?

1255
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,919
Our guy used to be
a big shot.
Now he's nobody.

1256
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:11,987
The girl--she's living
the dream.

1257
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,388
Should have died
10 years ago

1258
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:14,957
when she could marry
money.

1259
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,659
Too late now--she's
every woman's nightmare.

1260
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,928
She goes home
with a fella.
She ends up dead.

1261
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,330
Let your guy go?
Why?

1262
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,498
What was he doing
there with her?

1263
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,466
That's not what he's
being tried for.

1264
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,301
Really?

1265
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,143
What time does Bruce
get in?

1266
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,111
1:05.

1267
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:39,147
What if it were
an accident?

1268
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,120
Ah.

1269
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,154
Thank you for coming today.

1270
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,189
Thank you.

1271
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:48,624
How are you?
I'm well, thank you.

1272
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,758
Good.

1273
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,859
My name is Michael
Brown.

1274
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,028
Jenny O'Brien.

1275
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,863
BROWN: I'm a retired
federal officer.

1276
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,199
I've spent most of
my government service
occupied with

1277
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,501
ballistics, which is
the study of projectiles

1278
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,137
and firearms.

1279
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:08,076
This is a model
of a firearm, a revolver.

1280
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,347
As you see, it cannot
fire anything.

1281
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,883
There is nothing
to fire.

1282
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,953
It's solid plastic.
That's all it is.

1283
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,957
This model--I won't
call it a toy, because
it's not a toy--

1284
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:23,892
is designed for purposes
of demonstration.

1285
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,394
OK?

1286
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,495
Mmm.

1287
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:31,266
Basically...it's
a garage door opener.

1288
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,269
Now, here is one
thing this model
can do.

1289
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:38,840
If the trigger is
depressed, it sends
a signal...

1290
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,975
[Alarm sounds]

1291
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,544
The light and
the alarm go off.

1292
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,082
You all received your
checks for coming in
today?

1293
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,250
Yes.

1294
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,818
Fine.

1295
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,688
In addition to your
honorarium, in addition
to that,

1296
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,425
if you can insert the model
in your mouth without
pulling the trigger,

1297
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,760
you'll receive $300.

1298
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,362
You understand?

1299
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,599
Yeah.

1300
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,067
Wrapped in plastic.

1301
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,169
Completely sterile.

1302
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,038
Please remove it
from the plastic.

1303
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:19,014
Now without pulling
the trigger,

1304
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,750
insert the model
in your mouth.

1305
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,886
Close it.

1306
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,489
JAMES: For God's sakes,
what the fuck
are you doing?!

1307
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,024
Take it out!
Take it out of your mouth!

1308
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,994
[Alarm ringing]

1309
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:40,268
That's our case.

1310
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,737
And what does
forensics say?

1311
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:44,740
Forensics says the gun
was inside her mouth,

1312
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,175
handle and trigger guard
down, which means that

1313
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,510
the front sight was up.

1314
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:52,147
Now, somebody yells, "Take
that gun out of your mouth."

1315
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:54,082
She pulls it out fast.

1316
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:57,085
The front sight gets caught
on her upper teeth,

1317
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,921
hand keeps pulling,
depresses the trigger,
the gun goes off.

1318
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:00,989
It's not in
evidence.

1319
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,157
I'll put it
in the closing.

1320
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:03,492
It's too late.
I'll tell you
why.

1321
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,427
Everybody at that
point assumes that
he's guilty.

1322
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,596
Linda, all of this,
the rubber gun?

1323
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,564
I won't take the rubber
gun to court.

1324
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,099
Linda...

1325
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,968
It's so clear.
The judge didn't allow
Clarkson's diary.

1326
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,202
he won't allow--

1327
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,171
Linda, the point is,
all right,

1328
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,440
they think he's
a monster.

1329
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,841
You take the skull in,
they're sure.

1330
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,743
Monster. Lives in a
cave. Look at the skull.

1331
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,845
They turn away from your
client and his evidence.

1332
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,047
I make them
look at it.

1333
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,581
You're thrashing,
Linda.

1334
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,417
I'm telling you that
if she put the gun
in her own mouth--

1335
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,685
and she did--

1336
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,887
And I am telling you,
the only way you can
introduce

1337
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,722
all this fucking
Ben-Hur

1338
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,324
is in support of
direct testimony.

1339
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,694
Remember procedure,
which testimony only
comes and could come

1340
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:42,397
on direct from
Mr. Spector.

1341
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,865
Are you gonna put him
on the stand,

1342
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,501
or should I just fucking
go jump under a train.

1343
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,136
What?

1344
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,377
BRUCE: Take care of
yourself.

1345
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,285
PHIL: Thank you,
Ben.

1346
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,754
People say diet
is bullshit.

1347
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:06,955
Diet is not
bullshit.

1348
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,224
I want to talk to you
about tomorrow.

1349
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,325
What's this?

1350
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,461
LINDA: That's
a note from Bruce.

1351
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,129
A note?

1352
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,937
"My personal
numbers" in case
of what?

1353
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:25,207
In the case
you need him.

1354
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,541
These numbers are
in New York.

1355
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,676
Yeah. Well, Bruce
went back.

1356
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,677
Look here.

1357
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,112
This is the statement--

1358
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,713
Bruce went back
to New York?

1359
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,448
Yeah, sure. You knew
he was going back.

1360
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,750
To do his
television show.

1361
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,152
No. He didn't go back
to do his television show.

1362
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,221
He left me to do--

1363
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,522
Philip.

1364
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,758
Philip, you told him
you didn't wish him to--

1365
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,392
do you recall
the closing?

1366
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,129
You agreed,
the judge agreed that
Bruce could retire

1367
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,163
before the closing.

1368
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,664
Retire from
the case?

1369
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:50,932
Yes. Well,
you agreed.

1370
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,334
What, I agreed?
What do you mean,
I agreed?

1371
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:56,171
I agreed to what?
I agreed to what?

1372
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,339
It's relevant to this?

1373
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,107
No, no, no, no.

1374
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:00,475
No. This is unethical.

1375
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,011
He withdrew in open
court, Philip.
You were there.

1376
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,713
I didn't understand.

1377
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,747
Well, you
discussed this.

1378
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,017
When I paid him
$1 million

1379
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,318
to defend my life?

1380
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:13,121
You and the judge
and Bruce Cutler, remember?

1381
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,356
You all talked
about this.

1382
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,359
I thought he was going
on a trip. Come on!

1383
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,594
"These are my
New York numbers"?

1384
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,695
He has other clients.

1385
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,897
He left me.

1386
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,132
He left me to do
his television show.

1387
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,400
Don't break my heart.

1388
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:30,472
And I paid him
$1 million, and I
foolishly expected

1389
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,974
from him, loyalty.

1390
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,476
For--for what?

1391
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,477
For life?

1392
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:36,778
No.

1393
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,682
For the duration
of a trial, in which

1394
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,685
he pleaded with me
to give him the job.

1395
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,686
Why did he want
the job?

1396
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,821
Why?

1397
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:47,155
Because he liked me?

1398
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,824
He despised me.

1399
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,060
He wanted the job
because I needed him,

1400
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,362
because I was weak.

1401
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,064
He was strong.

1402
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,900
He wanted my money.

1403
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,101
I don't understand
that?

1404
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,138
Philip, you agreed
in front of a judge--

1405
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,706
I thought he was
going shopping.

1406
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,674
Please.

1407
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,108
Who was there to
tell me different?

1408
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,244
Who? Who could have?
I'm ignorant.

1409
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,745
What do I know
about these things?

1410
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,015
Who could have sat me
down and told me and
explained it to me?

1411
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,016
Who?

1412
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,484
My lawyer.

1413
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,519
That's who.

1414
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,520
Who's gone.

1415
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:20,589
You let him go.

1416
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,199
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you're upset.

1417
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,536
I know you are.

1418
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:35,670
So.

1419
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,274
What do we do now?

1420
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,644
If you testify,
we get to do

1421
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,112
the demonstrations.

1422
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,280
I don't get that.

What does it cost her
to lash out at me?

1581
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:43,805
Or you, for that
matter?

1582
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,373
Philip, this is
a rehearsal.

1583
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,774
I know it's
a rehearsal!

1584
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,110
Damn it! What do you
think I am?

1585
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:50,578
An idiot?

1586
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,046
Do you think
I'm a fool?

1587
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,948
Do you think I don't
know what this is
about?

1588
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,851
I've played this
game a million
times before.

1589
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,187
I know how
the game is played!

1590
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:02,323
I've done this
my whole life.
What do you think?

1591
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:08,263
They kill men for
telling the truth.

1592
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:09,497
This is the truth!

1593
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,633
All right. All right.
All out.

1594
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,700
Everybody out.
PHIL: Uh, but...

1595
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:13,935
[Linda coughs]

1596
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,471
OK.

1597
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,447
I worked my whole life.

1598
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:32,520
I worked my whole life.

1599
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,322
All right?

1600
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:35,623
LINDA: It's not all right.

1601
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,659
It's not all right.
It's not all right.

1602
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,560
It's certainly not
all right, Philip.

1603
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,196
If you go off like
that in the
courtroom--

1604
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:44,465
And I know you put
the woman up there to see

1605
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,533
if I'd go off.

1606
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,868
This is not going off.

1607
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,737
Not re-fucking-motely.

1608
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,073
Would you like to
trust me, Philip?

1609
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:54,442
You might want to
trust me, because
I'm the last person

1610
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,045
who both, "A,"
believes in you and
"B" has the power

1611
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,212
to help your case.

1612
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,414
Oh, is that why
you brought back--

1613
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,682
Shut up, Philip.
Now listen.

1614
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,650
You know the
difference between

1615
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,985
your different
behaviors.

1616
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,322
I act the same
with everyone.

1617
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,990
No, nobody does.

1618
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,358
You didn't act the
same around your
bands.

1619
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,260
You didn't act
the same around
the Beatles

1620
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,128
like you did with
an autograph-seeker.

1621
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,164
You can control
your behavior.

1622
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,799
Why is this
important?

1623
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,000
Because if you
don't,

1624
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:22,437
you're going to jail
for the rest
of your life.

1625
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,871
The prosecution is
gonna do everything

1626
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,973
in its power
to enrage you

1627
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,277
because that's all
they have.

1628
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,245
That is what we are
doing here today.

1629
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:35,083
They have no facts.
They have to break
you.

1630
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,118
You see, if you go
off, the jury will
say,

1631
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,721
"He did it now.
I'm sure he
did it then,"

1632
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,055
and they'll put you
away.

1633
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,757
I had no trouble
with the Beatles.

1634
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,126
And you will have no
trouble with the
D.A.

1635
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,695
if you recall that
you want something
from him

1636
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,265
and you will go
free.

1637
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,369
Now, I want
something from you.

1638
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,971
I want you to give
up the pills,
give up the wine

1639
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,973
for the 2 or 3 days
you'll be on the
stand

1640
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,508
and keep your
composure,

1641
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,676
just like you did
around the Beatles.

1642
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,312
I mean, if Paul
disagreed with you,

1643
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:05,413
did you scream at
him?

1644
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,115
On "Let It Be"?

1645
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,017
I was proved right.

1646
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,887
And you will be
proved right here

1647
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,922
if you keep
your composure.

1648
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,191
But if you don't,
you won't.

1649
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:21,929
I promise you that
I will be prepared
mentally,

1650
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,233
spiritually, and that
I will make a good
impression

1651
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:30,204
and...keep their respect.

1652
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,173
I understand.

1653
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,343
Thank you.

1654
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:36,344
You know why?

1655
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:37,845
Why?

1656
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:43,351
Not for what they
think of me, but what
you think of me.

1657
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,952
Thank you. I
take that

1658
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,387
as a great
compliment.

1659
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:55,029
LINDA: Vicky,
where's the car?

1660
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,030
PHIL: So.

1661
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:57,098
All right?

1662
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,766
Yeah. I'm just
saving it--you know,

1663
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:03,771
saving my best work
for when we're rolling.

1664
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,573
I'm a little tired, too,
I think.

1665
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,643
Best I go home
and rest for tomorrow.

1666
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,411
PHIL:
No, I get it.

1667
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,148
It--it don't start
getting better till
it's gotten bad.

1668
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,583
I'm equal to it.

1669
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:19,654
Hey, guys, you want
to see if the car's
ready, please?

1670
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:20,655
MAN: I got it.

1671
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,656
Anyway, thank
you.

1672
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,291
No.

1673
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,159
This was
a good idea.

1674
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,494
You rest up.
We'll see you tomorrow.

1675
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,763
OK.

1676
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,665
So thank you
all.

1677
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:34,068
Let me just say I
know you were paid

1678
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:37,171
to get me prepared.

1679
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,973
You did an excellent
job.

1680
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:42,777
You were paid to
perform,

1681
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:46,347
and your performance
was perfect.

1682
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:49,884
So can I do as
well as you?

1683
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:52,920
Tomorrow, we'll see.

1684
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:56,691
If I do, it's
because of you,
right?

1685
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,926
Thank you.

1686
01:14:58,961 --> 01:14:59,994
Linda, you want to go
to the car?

1687
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,429
LINDA: Yeah.

1688
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:08,569
What you're doing,
Linda, is good.

1689
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:11,506
It's what I always
tried to do,

1690
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,807
so I know
what you're doing.

1691
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:16,410
What am I doing, Philip?

1692
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,547
You're defending
the artist.

1693
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:22,216
I know you're not
well.

1694
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,586
I know what this
is costing you.

1695
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,122
That's what I go by.

1696
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:32,426
I've met a lot of
crazy people
in my life.

1697
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:36,764
I've met very few
sane ones

1698
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,866
that I could
talk to.

All right.

1701
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,208
Here we go.

1702
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:53,648
â™ª

1703
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,416
He don't look good.

1704
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,785
He's tired.

1705
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,422
Are you going to keep him
up on the stand
all day tomorrow?

1706
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:04,425
I'm gonna keep him
up there till they
all get used to him,

1707
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,761
after which he will
no longer be an
oddity

1708
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,897
but a beloved
eccentric,

1709
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:11,465
and they'll be
telling their
grandchildren

1710
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,835
how they helped to
set an innocent man
free.

Linda, hi.

1715
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:28,149
You know my wife
Kelly.

Linda Kenney Baden.

1717
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,384
No. Hi.

1718
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,752
How do you do?

1719
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:33,187
Honey, the tickets.

1720
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,789
The tickets--
I'm sorry.

1721
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:36,991
I'll be right back.

1722
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:41,495
So how long have
you two been married?

1723
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,698
I've been following
your trial.

1724
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:47,368
How could you defend
that man?

1725
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,537
What does your pin mean?

1726
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:50,705
Medical aid
for Africa.

1727
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,672
And are you active
in that?

1728
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:52,807
Yes, I am.

1729
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,175
So you're compassionate.

1730
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,176
All right.

1731
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,544
So would you hire
an ex-convict?

1732
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:57,878
I might.

1733
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,681
So suppose she was
convicted of, say,
theft

1734
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,384
and she comes to you,
she tells you her story,
and you judge she deserves

1735
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:07,254
a break, so you give
her a job, and then after
a year or so,

1736
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,389
the household money
goes missing.

1737
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:09,957
Do you suspect her
first?

1738
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,025
I would of course
check--

1739
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,927
Of course you do.

1740
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,796
No matter how much
you're committed to
"presumed innocent,"

1741
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,732
you will suspect
her first.

1742
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:20,935
I work in the music
business.

1743
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,037
I know something
about your client.

1744
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,438
He's a terrible man.

1745
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,906
He's not being tried
for that.

1746
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,274
Do you think
he shot her?

1747
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:29,043
I don't see how
he could have.

1748
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,078
Can you prove that
he didn't shoot her?

1749
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,114
Well, that's not
my job.

1750
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,482
By the way--

1751
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:35,716
I got them.

1752
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:38,019
did you know that
your husband is
cheating on you?

1753
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,420
That's ridiculous.

1754
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:41,756
And that's called
"giving him the benefit
of the doubt."

1755
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,723
It's good to see
you, Linda.

1756
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,758
You, too.

1757

you'll get him off?

Yes, I do.

If you get him off,
what will you do

the next girl?

As we near the end
of a long--a very long
trial,

1767
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,997
Phil Spector, once
the darling of the music
industry,

1768
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:34,769
having sold millions
of records, now facing
a jury,

1769
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:38,472
charged with the shooting
death of actress Lana
Clarkson.

1770
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,007
What are we seeing down
there, Patty?

1771

PATTY: That's right, Bill.

1772
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,844
His name is in the record
books, and we all
know his music,

1773
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:47,982
but the trial, the charge,
have nothing to do
with his profession

1774
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,483
but of course with
his personal life.

1775

I know this is the day
that you've all been
waiting for.

You've been waiting
on his arrival,

01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:58,159
and here, yes, here is
Phil Spector.

1778
01:19:58,193 --> 01:19:59,326
Ready.

1779
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,594
Dr. Spitz, you
understand we
won't be

01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,662
getting to you for
several days

1781
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:02,863
Yes.

1782
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:04,165
we will be examining
Mr. Spector...

1783
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,566
I understand.

1784
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,667
But I thought it was
important for you to
hear the testimony

1785
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:07,701

OK.

no, no, no, no.

Either way.

OK? this.
Uh-huh.

You come from the
back of the court

1807

and you
pass me a note,

1808
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,079
only make sure
it's not blank,
because Fiedler

1809
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,949
might ask to see it,
so it should say

1810

1812
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,321
Can he keep it
together on the stand?

1813
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,323
He's got to,
all right?

PATTY: We're here outside
the State Courthouse, where

1815

a rather spectacular entrance.

01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,840
[Knock on door]

1894
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,942
Yes, we're
coming.

1895
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,777
I presume they want us
back in court.

1896
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:44,912
Yes, that's it.

1897
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:46,547
So...

1898
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:54,354
I want you to put
your mind at rest.

1899
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:58,492
When I'm up there,
should they mention
my hair, and they may,

1900
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:01,361
I'll be proud to
tell them just
what I told you.

1901
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,333
All right?

1902
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:10,370
I'm ready.

1903
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:12,206
All right.

1904
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,409
I'm ready.

1905
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,978
WOMAN: All rise.

1906
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,447
The Superior Court for the
County of Los Angeles,
hear ye, hear ye,

1907
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:23,016
"People vs. Philip Spector."

1908
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,552
The honorable judge Larry
Paul Fidler presiding.

1909
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,154
All having business before
this court come forward

1910
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,288
and you will be heard.

1911
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:29,289
Be seated.

1912
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:32,259
â™ª

1913
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:36,730
FIDLER: Ms. Baden,
I believe you wanted to call

1914
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,465
one more witness
for the defense.

1915
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:43,337
â™ª

1916
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,173
Counselor?

1917
01:25:49,677 --> 01:25:53,514
Ms. Baden, I'm waiting.

1918
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,481
[Clears throat.

1919
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:56,884
Counselor!

1920
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:59,486
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.

1921
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,289
â™ª

1922
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,525
The defense calls...

1923
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:07,461
the defense calls
Dr. Werner Spitz.

1924
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,830
â™ª

1925
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,865
SPITZ: Excuse me.

1926
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,734
MAN: All right.

1927
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,102
SPITZ: Excuse me.

1928
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:20,407
â™ª

1929
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,809
Philip, we'll just--
let's see tomorrow,

1930
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,077
we'll see how it goes.

1931
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,346
MAN: Raise
your right hand.

1932
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,082
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony
you're about to give

1933
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:30,484
in the matter now
before this court...

1934
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:33,987
Phil Spector has arrived.
Take a look behind me

1935
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:37,491
as his Mercedes begins to make
its way down the drive.

1936
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,894
You can see his driver going at
a very fast speed

1937
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,597
while the protesters are yelling
"Justice for Lana."

1938
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,633
Here he comes as he makes his
way down the street,

1939
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:50,137
up to his mansion, and he's
pulling up to...

1940
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:52,272
MAN: Go ahead.

1941
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:53,307
No, no, no, no, no.

1942
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:54,274
Stop. Get back.

1943
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,576
Hold on.

1944
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,910
REPORTER: ...
on the driveway...

1945
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:59,479
â™ª

1946
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:04,685
I've got one
for you.

1947
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:05,686
All right.

1948
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,387
Why the barbed wire?

1949
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:08,989
To keep people
out.

1950
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:12,626
Nobody was trying
to get in.

1951
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,662
Why does the monster
live in a castle?

1952
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,531
Why does the minotaur
live in a cave?

1953
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:19,333
I mean, he could live
wherever he wanted.

1954
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,235
Why does he live
in a cave?

1955
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,537
Why does the minotaur
live in a cave?

1956
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:26,306
To keep himself
from doing harm.

1957
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,375
But he came out.

1958
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:38,151
I believe he is
not guilty.

1959
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,220
Are you sure?

1960
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,289
No.

1961
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:44,558
But I have
a reasonable doubt.

1962
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,861
MAN: This is
Brian Jennings.

1963
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:50,998
Another day, another
turn in the saga.

1964
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:55,068
Phil Spector retired for the
night to his home that

1965
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,737
that he calls his "castle."

1966
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,006
And we'll leave you
for tonight, too.

1967
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:02,175
Signing off from Los
Angeles...

1968
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:10,117
