1
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,908
You're late!

2
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,041
Well, I could not come earlier.

3
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,033
Well I've only come because
you like this music.

4
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,966
Sarge caught me running
and I had to lose him.

5
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:15,577
Come on!

6
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,500
Watch out, man!

7
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,015
What do you think?

8
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,550
Oh, well... not bad, a little noisy...

9
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,440
- What shall we do tonight?
- Have not we done?

10
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:16,750
- We have to do something else.
- Oh no, I can not.

11
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,390
My parents will be
hysterical if I late again.

12
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,140
Fuck them!

13
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Okay, here we go.

14
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,365
Hello!

15
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,315
I was cleaning.

16
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,045
Listen, it does not give
me the last 2 innings.

17
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,740
You close this thing and
see the movie for free.

18
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,505
I do not like flying saucers.

19
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,975
There is a movie of dishes... is a warning.

20
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,010
I do not like warnings and...
I like you either.

21
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,645
- Sure you do. - No... seriously.

22
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
If you do not treat me
right I will not ask out.

23
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:34,720
I do not want to date you.

24
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:37,250
Goodbye, baby!

25
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,620
It nixer... accelerates,
accelerates before we see.

26
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:45,150
Come, we gonna catch.

27
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,580
- Do you have to make supplication?
- Hey, I already had a point!

28
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,675
Would not she the one who had to point?

29
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,228
- Just below the navel. - What?

30
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,091
Since you run off to boots.

31
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,850
Hey! Have you seen the sci-fi movie?

32
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:59,437
Do we have to bear it, Dude?

33
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,568
The only opinion I need is yours.

34
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,540
Try some aliens, who steal their
soul to humans while they sleep.

35
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,300
There's a guy with his girl,
trying to escape human monsters

36
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,301
to warn the world of what happens.

37
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,490
How does it end?

38
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,771
The girl falls asleep and
becomes one of them.

39
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,425
Will run at night?

40
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,994
Yes, I'd say about aunt, aunt's passing.

41
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,172
Because I had to warn the world.

42
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,218
And an aunt is not more
important than the world.

43
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:29,744
Wait... What if I wanted to? What
if she was for all the world?

44
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:33,710
That if, if she was his whole world
had to stay with her, right?

45
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,375
The hell!

46
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,410
- I thought you left me.
- We're out, baby... Do not you see?

47
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Va, come darling.

48
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,634
Why do not you come down here, nixer?
See you later.

49
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:52,735
Hey Dude!...

50
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,391
Look who's coming.

51
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,070
Hey!... but if it Dude...
The human anteater.

52
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,583
Is today the catechesis
the released them before?

53
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,510
Look at his girlfriend... Dude do you do?
To go girls across the Mexican border?

54
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,565
Shut up, asshole!

55
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,170
Oh, speaking Spanish ons!

56
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:22,731
You're jealous because
I speak two languages.

57
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,824
Better stick with the Spanish,
because your English bites.

58
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,310
So bitch!

59
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,675
You look beautiful tonight, Sister Teresa.

60
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,300
The largest I have your head.

61
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:39,578
Shut up, fool!

62
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,180
Hey, that's my sister, largemouth!
I'll kill you!

63
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,528
Let's go.

64
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,935
Hey!... To!... You hair is burning!

65
00:09:26,628 --> 00:09:27,758
You hair is burning!

66
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:51,728
And now, where we're going, Dude?

67
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,453
This is very romantic, very romantic...

68
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:56,591
take me home.

69
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,250
- That... take her home. - Come on, Donna.

70
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,840
Shit!

71
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,562
Hey, you have fallen!...
brake!, have fallen!

72
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,592
Fuck.

73
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,335
I'll upload the bastard!

74
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,186
Go!

75
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:16,995
Give me a kiss.

76
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,036
Within

77
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
You can see your parents.

78
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,830
What do you say? They are sleeping.

79
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:23,926
Apparently not.

80
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,524
Very timely, as always.

81
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:28,486
I have brought the
newspaper a little early.

82
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,574
I had to have given the kiss here.

83
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,957
Anyway, Donna.

84
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,640
Pussy!

85
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,600
Setting

86
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,780
- Have you noticed the hand? - Damn, right!

87
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:15,669
See? Do you see how carefully
covers it with the bread?

88
00:13:17,118 --> 00:13:19,390
Watch as changes bread texture.

89
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:26,633
My particular theory... is partly
due to the fat of the sausage,

90
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,460
and partly to the sweet
angelic touch of their hands.

91
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,652
My mom makes them every day
since it enters the body.

92
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,686
And taught me...

93
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,684
to bring a spare in your pocket.

94
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,326
God bless you!

95
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,894
What if I need a snack to get by.

96
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:46,717
Ten!

97
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,042
We do not yet

98
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,987
First I want the smell.

99
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:03,308
You have to learn to use something
other than the eyes and ears.

100
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,816
He showed it to all my new teammates.

101
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,292
Tricks of the trade.

102
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:17,832
Only that...

103
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:19,588
anyone will tell...

104
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,166
if you know the tricks...

105
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:22,715
know the trade.

106
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:24,906
Sink your teeth!

107
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,420
Damn, that woman has great hands.

108
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,638
Slip this into your pocket.

109
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Ehm... Listen to me carefully...

110
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,533
Those guys are no longer the same.

111
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,693
You know who is to blame?

112
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,054
The Rock'nRoll.

113
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:06,318
That music makes the guys
in a gang of werewolves...

114
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:09,099
love sex, beer and car racing.

115
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,647
There goes that Dude!

116
00:15:16,657 --> 00:15:17,857
Let's get that son of a bitch!

117
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:47,853
How much noise coming, officer?

118
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,936
What a show the last night, Dude.

119
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,980
Yes, you should be more careful...
Someone could get hurt.

120
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,883
Hey, do not get smart, boy.

121
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:00,967
What do you have eaten?

122
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:03,600
Eh! He has made his mother, blockhead!

123
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:05,228
Do you cook in a pigsty?

124
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,132
Out of the car!

125
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,222
Hands on the door.

126
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:16,562
These thugs need to be careful,
have switchblade knives.

127
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,613
Does wearing today, blockhead?

128
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,468
- What?

129
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,069
Do you carry knife?

130
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,553
Why not sign up to your own son?

131
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:24,987
Regístrale pockets!

132
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:29,483
Regístramelos good puppy.

133
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:32,083
You may find dog biscuits
which makes his mother.

134
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:36,013
Hey, his mother makes
them especially for him.

135
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,132
I'm certain you have.

136
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:39,363
Do you know?

137
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:43,310
One of these days I'll kick your ass.

138
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,692
Why do not you do it now
and saved the wait?

139
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,967
No... When I give you...

140
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:50,853
be for something that you
can not escape happily...

141
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:53,500
rabbit with that smirk.

142
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm so close to beat you
up nearly'm seeing.

143
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,651
Would you aroused just
thinking about it, eh?

144
00:17:09,182 --> 00:17:12,963
Listen, I can lock up when
I damn well, but surely...

145
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,631
that the prison is too
good for a guy like you.

146
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,050
This is my city.

147
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,101
No one rides their own laws in my city.

148
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,560
Take care of yourself, kid. Right?

149
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Hey, can you look your Uncle
Charlie, talk alike, but it is not.

150
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:06,841
Half the people in town are aliens...

151
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,982
and the other half is about to be.

152
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,323
They are all like zombies.

153
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,271
Van following the usual
routine without any emotion.

154
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,051
What are hell are you talking about?

155
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:21,059
"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"

156
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,805
It's a movie, JT. You shut
up and kitchen, will you?

157
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,338
We talk about a movie.

158
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,547
Shut up fool, or I spit on the burger.

159
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:29,625
Go ahead...

160
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:31,914
not be more disgusting.

161
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:36,435
- What time is spent? - Keep it up, nixer!

162
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,470
At 9. but starts at 9 and 10. There
are 3 developments and news.

163
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Well, look... not a true story, is a movie.

164
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,680
You must see it.

165
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,376
- Sorry. -'s Burning!

166
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,859
JT, do you fill it again?

167
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:54,784
Do you... have a rag?

168
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:55,659
Yes, I have 40 wipes.

169
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:57,896
Well give us 30.

170
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,166
Take this.

171
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:01,632
Only one. Oh, and Sign me up this thing.

172
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,598
And now I want to refill.

173
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:06,433
If you would not mind.

174
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:08,753
A pair of doubles!

175
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:10,431
Shut up.

176
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:13,476
Get out!

177
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,448
I've burned all the hair
my girlfriend, Dude.

178
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,476
Pussy!, Now has to wear a wig.

179
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:30,342
It seems an old!

180
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I thought it was your old.

181
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:40,387
Do one thing...

182
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:42,864
bring it here...

183
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:44,594
Take off the wig...

184
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,951
and daddy will make bald spit shine.

185
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,494
If you want you can kill...

186
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,754
but what will you do in my place, okay?

187
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:07,998
And now let fooling...

188
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,293
before I get to make fresh meat patties.

189
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:16,491
Sit Dude!

190
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:21,831
Sorry, JT.

191
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:28,667
Tonight...

192
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:29,693
on the cliff...

193
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:31,063
at 9.

194
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,531
Does the cliff? Uncle Jo!,
That site is dangerous...

195
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,158
Shut up, asshole!

196
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:40,832
No, do not you remember Teddy?, Now
have to take my sister to skate.

197
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:41,876
Fuck him!

198
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,900
Dude, I've promised!

199
00:20:44,114 --> 00:20:45,679
As compensation for having burnt hair.

200
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:48,703
Do you skate? Hey Teddy...

201
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,832
beware do not go wrong with
the likes of the skirt.

202
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:55,797
We see the faces... Dude.

203
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:58,810
Sure thing.

204
00:21:43,057 --> 00:21:44,112
"Hello?"

205
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:45,432
Hi, Donna.

206
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,459
Dudi!

207
00:21:48,005 --> 00:21:49,234
Oh, do not call me that.

208
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:52,366
Hey, sorry about last night.

209
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,331
He had to have known they would be raised.

210
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,143
Now they want to be home for dinner, sorry.

211
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,367
Bah, anyway, just want to
tell their side of the story.

212
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,327
Get out of here!

213
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,129
When I see you again?

214
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,171
Want to go skating tonight?

215
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,505
Would you take me to skate?

216
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:12,237
Why do not you?

217
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,023
Well... but I can not
believe you want to go.

218
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:18,963
Of course I want, for my Donna anything.

219
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,241
Pick me up at 8.

220
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:25,232
Best at 9.

221
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,111
All right, bye.

222
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,217
Shit!

223
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,127
To see if you aim!

224
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,866
Have not you ever had one of those
days where the jet is divided into two

225
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:16,060
and goes to the two sides of
the urinal and hit them all?

226
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:18,470
Si. Be more careful!

227
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,813
With a little will suffice.

228
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,741
Duel.

229
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:50,932
At last.

230
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,753
It's okay Julie, it looks great.

231
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,651
The hell!

232
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,977
It takes getting used to.

233
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,520
- Julie is here.
- If... and also Teddy. That strong, right?

234
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,580
- Coincidence? - Sorry, Donna.

235
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,812
Oh!... I thought you were
going to get to skate.

236
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,424
We skated.

237
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,635
It's time to dance in pairs.

238
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:10,142
And here's a song dedicated to Julie.

239
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,785
She devotes nixer.

240
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,937
Let me crash head on my wall...
Of Hasil Adkins.

241
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:35,818
Wait a minute.

242
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:38,816
Going out in the newspapers.

243
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:40,904
Fuck you in the ass.

244
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,025
Are you satisfied?

245
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,344
Care... sliding.

246
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:29,949
Sorry Donna, compensare you, I promise.

247
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:31,677
Come on, you hear this.

248
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,318
- What?

249
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,140
- What?

250
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,768
"What do you want?

251
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:09,029
What I tell you?

252
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,417
What I tell you?

253
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,142
I was caught off guard.

254
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,930
Then you have a problem.

255
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:24,081
And if you want to be a man have to solve.

256
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:26,427
And do not come to me for help.

257
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,877
I will resolve it.

258
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:30,381
Yes

259
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,662
For now do nothing but
look like an asshole.

260
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,889
I've never made a fool!

261
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:40,636
We'll never

262
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,195
You have to take these tough fumes

263
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,006
and then sew it to hosts to kick his ass.

264
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:50,590
Have not I taught you anything?

265
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:56,393
If I ever catch you doing that
in public, hit a beating...

266
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:59,721
the hit you as if you were nobody.

267
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:00,557
Can you hear me?

268
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,720
That does not look like
I have a son asshole.

269
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,260
Be a man.

270
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,090
I'll show you who's the asshole.

271
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,224
There is nothing good in that radio shit.

272
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,693
I have an idea.

273
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,302
Ten... touches your something.

274
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,167
If you do not like the music I play.

275
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,941
You touch something.

276
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,290
Why do not you play in a band?

277
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,526
I do not like playing the most.

278
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:01,289
But there must be someone you admire.

279
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:06,084
I do not admire anyone.

280
00:33:06,455 --> 00:33:07,159
To no one.

281
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:08,852
No, no.

282
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:10,869
No one, no?

283
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,466
Link Wray's fine.

284
00:33:16,845 --> 00:33:18,000
Link Wray...

285
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,513
Is it famous?

286
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,934
No... make it right.

287
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,466
If it was so good...
seriously famous, is not it?

288
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:37,805
But what do you do? Oh, my God!

289
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,437
If the good is because he's
famous, you can all go to hell.

290
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,226
But, what are you doing girl?

291
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,421
Come on, play something sweet.

292
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:52,863
This is sweet.

293
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:01,748
You do not give bad.

294
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,434
It sucks.

295
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,982
If I could see your father!

296
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,210
You have given me.

297
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,351
You will... when you
came and you found out.

298
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,386
You think you're funny, right?

299
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,932
It's a good comic, Sarge.

300
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,720
Do you like hot dogs, Sarge?
You can bite mine.

301
00:35:17,817 --> 00:35:19,967
Hey, you should not talk like that,

302
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,213
unless you want Donna's mother finds out

303
00:35:22,272 --> 00:35:24,730
what were you doing last
night at Marphis Point.

304
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,641
I have nothing to hide, boss.

305
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:28,448
Really?

306
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:29,980
Really?

307
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:32,856
Well check this out...

308
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:37,580
if you have nothing to hide, as
you've deleted the name, huh?

309
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,876
Do not you know that's against the law?

310
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,741
The name does not matter.

311
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:46,072
Oh, forget it lieth me to
mourn and a time to another.

312
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,914
You asked for it.

313
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:53,179
What happens Dude? Your dad didnt want you?
Dont you showed love and understanding?

314
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:55,841
I thought you had to be sensitive you

315
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:58,252
to the problems of today's youth.

316
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:00,735
And we are... I'm sensitive.

317
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:03,600
But you, son, you're a lost cause.
Do you know?

318
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:05,773
Just like your father...

319
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:13,062
Your father... had some funny ideas
about how things had to be resolved.

320
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,005
And I take from here to kicks. He
left with his tail between his legs

321
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:21,145
And if you're still so shit that
history will repeat itself.

322
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,389
Take care, Delanney!

323
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,198
Ah, this bumper.

324
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:01,027
I mean you Johnny without a lead
guitarist it will not work.

325
00:37:01,062 --> 00:37:02,420
Who played guitar?

326
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,986
I'll tell you who touch her.

327
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:07,567
The touches me.

328
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,962
- But if you have to play the saxophone.
- Also I'm going to play.

329
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,098
Does it look bad?

330
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,268
No, what you say, Johnny.

331
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:25,016
- Ready, Tommy? - Sure, Johnny.

332
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:26,629
Ok

333
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,279
Do not go man.

334
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,066
Now, Johnny!

335
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,391
Very good guy.

336
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:33,105
Give!

337
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,186
And then going nixer and says: Come
on baby, you know that I'm good.

338
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,055
It's weird.

339
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,888
Tell me, going all night. He wants to
give you free tickets or something.

340
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:26,324
Go, go, go! Are not you something
north of the border, miss?

341
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,326
Where is your hero? Is not that
going to your side, right?

342
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,209
They are a chihuahua... and a giraffe.

343
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,581
I think we will make a stop here.

344
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,098
I do not understand... If it is Mexican?
How is it that their parents are white?

345
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:20,566
Ah... I had reductions in Mexico?

346
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,221
Son of a bitch.

347
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:28,780
Mamma Mia! I think I'm in
love with corn pancake.

348
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,971
We got screwed.

349
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,541
Any suggestions?

350
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:36,462
I'm just the drummer, Johnny.

351
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:37,366
Well, okay.

352
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,323
It will not work. We got screwed!

353
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,497
- Well, come on, let's go man.
- Now twice as fast!

354
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,367
How'd it go last night with that girl?

355
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,630
Bah... sent me gargle.

356
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,462
You had to have done the tea bag.

357
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:58,926
Is the tea bag?

358
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:01,050
What's that?

359
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:05,224
Consists put him and pull his
tongue over and over again.

360
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,720
- I have to talk to you, Dude.
- Do it again.

361
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,550
- Want to go to the movies tonight?
- No, I have to study.

362
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,049
Leave that shit the study and
come to the movies with me.

363
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:28,327
Why do not you go with him? I like more.

364
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,747
Come Dude, I have to talk, really.

365
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,211
- Come I want to see...
- Shit... there is Teddy.

366
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,356
"What happened?"

367
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,234
I enjoyed our walk in the park, Donna.

368
00:42:02,035 --> 00:42:03,310
Trying to tell you.

369
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,488
Did you do something?

370
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:05,928
I have an idea.

371
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:09,206
Promise you will not do anything.

372
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:11,473
What did he do?

373
00:42:12,737 --> 00:42:13,540
We'll have a party.

374
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:16,063
What did he do?

375
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,099
And Donna can make piñata.

376
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,457
The so-called

377
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:30,483
tried to kiss me.

378
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:34,575
So everyone will have their part.

379
00:42:46,091 --> 00:42:47,757
Have you got the shotgun shells?

380
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,968
Please do not do anything stupid.
He just wants to piss you off.

381
00:42:57,469 --> 00:42:57,969
Dude.

382
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:11,237
Dude.

383
00:43:17,673 --> 00:43:19,699
If I'm doing something stupid.

384
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,427
See you later, Donna.

385
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,860
Come Dude... as if there were
lots like her out there.

386
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:43,139
- What's the matter baby? Dont you like it?
- Forget what I said, Dude.

387
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:50,410
Want a tamale with that shake?

388
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,183
Hello, JT.

389
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,840
Sarge...

390
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,780
What do I owe you, JT?

391
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:09,428
Thank you.

392
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,614
JT, do not give special
treatment to this thug.

393
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:17,288
Are you a business,

394
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:19,197
or you take it as a business,

395
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,423
or you were in the street before
resorting to the Ministry of Health.

396
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:25,355
My thing is to feed people, Sergeant,

397
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,328
keep the thugs at bay is up to you.

398
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:32,549
You better be devoted to each his own.

399
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:36,489
That's the spirit, JT!

400
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,102
You shut up!

401
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:39,689
Yes

402
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,473
Got a minute?

403
00:45:59,103 --> 00:45:59,723
Sure.

404
00:46:03,544 --> 00:46:06,655
Well, you might seem a
little sudden, but...

405
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:09,692
I want to say that I like what you do.

406
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,748
Thank you.

407
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,053
How did you do that?

408
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:18,574
Fact what?

409
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:22,133
Well, that... I mean...

410
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:28,277
that the world is not very easy for those
who want to do things differently.

411
00:46:29,716 --> 00:46:33,828
Well I started playing, and went with it.
Nothing special.

412
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,063
- Do you smoke? - Yes... yes

413
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:53,638
Look at this, JT.

414
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:04,847
From here... to Eternity is
the time before I was born.

415
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:13,083
And from here to Eternity...
is the time after I die.

416
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:23,931
And this... is all the time that I have...

417
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:27,681
to use it.

418
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,560
You do nothing.

419
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,430
You'll spend the rest of
your days here in this town.

420
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,070
And you will die here...
with my burger in hand.

421
00:47:55,259 --> 00:47:55,940
And nothing more.

422
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,520
I want you to know that in my group
have good news and bad news.

423
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:15,656
We have signed a record
label to take on tour.

424
00:48:18,045 --> 00:48:21,940
- And the good news?
- That's the good news.

425
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:28,050
- Ah... well... what's the bad?
- Gone is the guitarist.

426
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:32,890
- Why?
- Because it was not the time or something.

427
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:35,907
Did you say you play?

428
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:40,677
If you think we can help,
you should do a test.

429
00:48:42,196 --> 00:48:44,060
If it goes well you could do the tour.

430
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,412
There is a lot of money.

431
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:49,783
Enough for 2 people to live?

432
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:52,197
Sure.

433
00:48:54,871 --> 00:48:59,296
Hey, I think you do because you know
that everyone is covered in shit.

434
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:04,971
If... I'm sick of all these people
who have success being a real shit.

435
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:08,882
Look, I want to make music...
to affright staff.

436
00:49:09,804 --> 00:49:11,592
If... I understand.

437
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:18,111
That same train came to
me long ago, and I lost.

438
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:21,954
This time will not go without me.

439
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,450
Our last show is tomorrow.

440
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,219
Come if you think you can fill the gap.

441
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,986
Okay... thanks.

442
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:59,844
Uncle!, A record... a tour.

443
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:03,401
Forget all this...

444
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,500
I never have an opportunity like that.

445
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:13,489
Girls... women... fame and fortune.

446
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,095
If... not say anything to
Donna, yet nothing is certain.

447
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,732
It might be jinxed.

448
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:26,232
No... I do not want to get your
hopes up, in case it does not work.

449
00:50:28,646 --> 00:50:35,148
Well... if you need rep
or something... not...

450
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:39,979
someone to help you... and if
I have other commitments...

451
00:50:41,327 --> 00:50:43,762
Shit... I will not go without you.

452
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:50,030
- Do you want to go see that movie tonight?
- I can not.

453
00:50:54,874 --> 00:50:56,438
Is it Donna?

454
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,011
Are you sure you want to
date someone like Dude?

455
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,736
Yes

456
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,241
It's that one day his father was caught
and we are scared to do the same.

457
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:17,225
Donna, just think about your future...
as good parents.

458
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:20,590
And with no one to guide him,
we fear that it can not give

459
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:22,644
everything you expect from a man.

460
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:27,453
Dude I know things you do not
know any of your friends gossip.

461
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:29,009
Like what?

462
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:32,176
As it is a good musician...

463
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:35,730
going to have a group going
to sign a record deal,

464
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:38,204
and earn so much money that will suck.

465
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,583
Well, if that happens you
will have our blessing.

466
00:51:41,003 --> 00:51:42,711
I already said.

467
00:51:43,565 --> 00:51:48,258
But if not, I want you to be
prepared to look at other options.

468
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:57,410
- Oh!... This will look that good. - If...

469
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,809
Go body!

470
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:09,027
I assure that you'll get later I can.

471
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,870
Ah... this jumps a lot, right?

472
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:51,037
It is good idea but jumps every
time we caught a pothole.

473
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,570
Well... What we do tonight?

474
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:21,052
Whatever you want, Donna. I like the dark.

475
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:28,564
I want to go see... a movie.

476
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:32,001
Want to watch a movie with me?

477
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,989
For my Dudi whatever.

478
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,438
What do you want to go see?

479
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,510
Thank you, Donna.

480
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,291
How many times have you seen this movie?

481
00:54:09,325 --> 00:54:10,098
15.

482
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,590
Why do not you tell me that
you had left your father?

483
00:55:26,742 --> 00:55:28,285
Never tell me anything.

484
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,114
There is nothing you have to know
about me that I have not counted.

485
00:55:33,545 --> 00:55:35,443
I want to hear about your father.

486
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:39,388
From my father just got a thing.

487
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:41,372
What?

488
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,474
Better not to know.

489
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:57,797
Fight,... in the park... tonight... at 9.

490
00:55:58,078 --> 00:55:59,773
Where children play, Teddy?

491
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:01,275
They will not miss.

492
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,273
I love to jump rope with you,
but I have an appointment.

493
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,154
It's settled, goes to your appointment.

494
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:09,294
I already atizare other day, not tonight.

495
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:11,308
With that hot chick got that quote?

496
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,969
Surely not this whore with which you.

497
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,031
With this Mexican whore.

498
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,791
We are

499
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:21,977
Like the music, right?

500
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:26,037
The cockroach... cockroach...

501
00:56:26,323 --> 00:56:27,590
Is a Mexican song, right Donna?

502
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:30,574
Did you know that you
were throwing a cockroach?

503
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,579
Leave her out of this.

504
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:35,007
Why? You would have burned my
girlfriend's hair, so bud!

505
00:56:35,204 --> 00:56:37,164
You think I'm going to
leave you alone like that?

506
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:47,382
Fuck you in the ass!

507
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:52,353
Tonight...

508
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,951
at 9...

509
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:57,744
At 9.

510
00:56:58,025 --> 00:56:59,413
I'm sure you are.

511
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:12,450
Are you are going through a bit, is not it?

512
00:57:21,716 --> 00:57:23,756
- What have been those now?
- Teddy wants to dance.

513
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,039
I thought that was the police.

514
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:47,369
Yeah right... is the police, but...

515
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:49,292
Do you not understand?,
Can not trust anyone.

516
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,720
They've taken over the entire city.

517
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,243
How the hell warn others if there's no one?

518
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:01,201
Fuck!, You can not even
trust his girlfriend.

519
00:58:01,675 --> 00:58:04,230
Well,... and when he learns
that the girl is one of them?

520
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:06,992
When she kisses him.

521
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:12,243
Whenever you hear well, right?

522
00:58:13,996 --> 00:58:19,063
When it's late... So are they... girls.

523
00:58:22,326 --> 00:58:24,159
Listen to me, guys.

524
00:58:24,282 --> 00:58:27,045
I have lived much longer than you.

525
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:31,461
Do you think a child dreamed of
making burgers for scum like you?

526
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,798
You have to know you want to do.

527
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,029
And above all... when.

528
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,850
Because the time is important.

529
00:58:47,184 --> 00:58:49,568
If not, you realize, as
the guy in the movie,

530
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:53,541
that... fuck... it's too late.

531
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:38,135
We ask you something.

532
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:42,470
What do you think it gives impression
that the son of Sergeant...

533
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:43,671
is the village idiot? Huh?

534
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,265
I'll tell you.

535
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,520
People say that you can skip the laws.

536
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,677
You know... my laws.

537
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:00,096
Because apparently you can not
handle a thug dirty and disgusting.

538
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,580
- I told you I will. - Yes?, How?

539
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:07,158
I challenged him to a fight tonight.

540
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:10,796
I have the kids ready if
comes up with something.

541
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,230
Everyone knows it's a hook.

542
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,724
You'll have to work hard to fuck at all.

543
01:00:17,734 --> 01:00:18,796
Listen...

544
01:00:20,092 --> 01:00:23,994
Not because I had a problem
with his father long ago.

545
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,691
Got it?"

546
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,605
I have my reasons for putting a broth.

547
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:35,834
You know, son? If excuses
were worth cents...

548
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,700
you'd be a fucking silver dollar.

549
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,520
Do not forget to put this
in my hand when I'm dead.

550
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:52,830
"Who knows what the devil
looks in the human heart"

551
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,130
"The Shadow knows"

552
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:19,436
- Dudi? - Hey, baby!

553
01:01:19,985 --> 01:01:20,285
Come here, I have to talk to you.

554
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:23,331
- What happens? - Sit.

555
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,480
You know that group you like?
They are looking for a guitarist.

556
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,215
- Yes, I have heard some comment.
- Is our chance!

557
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,459
- What do you mean?
- Have signed a record deal.

558
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:42,039
And are your style, do not
touch anything sweet.

559
01:01:42,962 --> 01:01:45,173
Now!, But I have to think about my mother.

560
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,290
Listen! If you had wanted to go
somewhere ask me to leave my parents.

561
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:58,887
Yeah, well... but not the same,
they are not your real parents,

562
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,498
are not your own blood.

563
01:02:05,285 --> 01:02:08,302
Do not go to the fight
tonight, Dude... please.

564
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,233
Come to the club, show them what you do.

565
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:17,067
Worth a try. We will not have
another chance like this.

566
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,660
Please... You promise you're going to try?

567
01:02:29,326 --> 01:02:30,214
"Please!

568
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,804
I promise you.

569
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,700
Ready to machacarles?

570
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,801
Yes, very well.

571
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,268
Teddy has gone too far.

572
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,652
I spoke to the club.

573
01:03:44,705 --> 01:03:46,260
I was talking about the fight.

574
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,996
Did not you hear anything I said JT?

575
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,415
Yes, I... an uncle very deep.

576
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:59,168
Dude, fuck the fight,

577
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:02,610
the only chance to get out of here.
Why waste it with Teddy?

578
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,475
My father never faced with
anything in his sad life.

579
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,175
One was dedicated to flee.

580
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:13,360
And I'm not going to flee.

581
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,803
Neither Teddy nor pig of his
father, or anyone else.

582
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,727
Do you have the brass knuckles?

583
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,186
- Oh, yes.

584
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:55,892
Do you think it will?

585
01:04:57,597 --> 01:05:00,079
At least that appears with this Donna.

586
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:04,612
You know that I like fair fights.

587
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:14,430
Meddle not, assholes... is all mine.

588
01:05:18,766 --> 01:05:21,159
Lately you have not hit very hard.

589
01:05:23,742 --> 01:05:25,399
Want to see how you swallow that comment?

590
01:05:27,366 --> 01:05:31,150
Just saying... Apparently
that made you all a cocoon.

591
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,670
You were lucky.

592
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:36,771
And the hair of my sister?

593
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:38,584
Then what are you gonna do, Teddy?

594
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:41,961
Would you let your face like a
finely chopped raw hamburger?

595
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,063
If... that and much more.

596
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:54,941
Its true that I do nothing of myself, but
I dont get in trouble.

597
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:57,379
People do not want to
know anything about you.

598
01:05:58,638 --> 01:06:02,138
It's exactly what I want,...
so do not bother me.

599
01:06:04,288 --> 01:06:07,886
Look, Dude... have forced me to be.

600
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:12,024
And you have forced... give me one.

601
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,455
You'd fuck not no crabs in a whorehouse.

602
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:15,679
Oh, very well.

603
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:18,421
Ten reflections!

604
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,620
Sorry, Dude.

605
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:33,926
- It's okay. - But...

606
01:06:34,071 --> 01:06:35,107
Stay away!

607
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:55,794
This if... which is stronger!...

608
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,190
We're here waiting asshole face.

609
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,580
That guy is not going to appear.

610
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:16,798
Hey, where are you going?

611
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,991
It's too chicken to come... we go.

612
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,095
I love it when you play out of tune!

613
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,592
Quarter's 11!

614
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:14,368
I know you hate this city,
you hate Teddy, I also...

615
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,223
But I also know how you like your music.

616
01:08:19,250 --> 01:08:23,696
Fight for what you like...
not for what you hate.

617
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,241
Well, what are you gonna do?

618
01:08:34,575 --> 01:08:38,238
Clubbing... and machacarles.

619
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,243
Need a lift?

620
01:11:25,484 --> 01:11:30,195
Hey, hey! They put a record spinning!

621
01:11:30,221 --> 01:11:33,721
It is a fraud!, Is a fraud!,
A fraud!, A fraud!, Fraud!

622
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,119
You bastards!...

623
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,152
They were playing a fucking fag.

624
01:12:09,187 --> 01:12:11,915
Music, Dude... it was just that...
just music.

625
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,160
A great fuck!

626
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:20,094
You did not have to, we had a
chance and you fucked up as ever.

627
01:12:22,733 --> 01:12:25,970
You're selfish, Dude. I give
a shit about my dreams.

628
01:12:26,335 --> 01:12:30,517
Those dreams are mine, not yours.
You get one.

629
01:13:34,483 --> 01:13:35,466
Asshole."

630
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,020
Now your father if you're going
to be okay to broth, Teddy.

631
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,621
No, Teddy!...

632
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:50,667
yes

633
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,119
Here we are...

634
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,447
Cursed chickenshit.

635
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,746
It's time...

636
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:32,454
once you start.

637
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,734
Fuck off with your shotgun cartridges!

638
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:27,990
Do you really think I would
have to buy the chocolates?

639
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,715
But if you're too fat.

640
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,225
I think with the petunias enough...

641
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:40,980
and even perhaps

642
01:17:41,277 --> 01:17:44,930
- Mustard? - Eh, sorry... what?

643
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,348
Do you want the dog
with or without mustard?

644
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:49,035
Sarge Con love the mustard.

645
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,610
Get in the fucking car...

646
01:17:53,852 --> 01:17:54,738
we go!

647
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,700
But do not want to eat?

648
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,030
Get in the fucking car now!

649
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,782
Add all at once!

650
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:45,271
- Where are you going, Dude?
- Looking for Donna.

651
01:18:46,570 --> 01:18:48,070
A Teddy something happened.

652
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,019
They say he is dead...

653
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:01,003
Take me with you, Dude.

654
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:04,490
You have to start following only your way.

655
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,620
What I do here? If I'm not
in trouble, I go crazy.

656
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,058
You spend what you better
looking than me mounting them.

657
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:27,815
What will you do?

658
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,851
Living in the streets,
with all the garbage...

659
01:19:37,344 --> 01:19:39,935
People throw many good things.

660
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,660
They're hung...

661
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,922
What are you doing, dude?

662
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,452
Say you do not think we
will go skating, Donna.

663
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:24,980
I want to help.

664
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,517
No can help me.

665
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,292
I will not ever believed
that I am a problem.

666
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:50,506
I can not go with you, Dude.

667
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:56,239
It's all... you're better off without me.

668
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,012
What remained of me?

669
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:10,414
A dim image in a mirror...

670
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,478
Faster!... catch that son of a bitch!

671
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,519
Damn...

672
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,410
This time will not get away, you bastard!

673
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:05,516
We... to end this... now.

674
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:10,485
I should have fucking long.

675
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,730
I'm going to kill you, fucking asshole.

676
01:24:08,969 --> 01:24:11,553
Check the brake! Check the brake!

677
01:24:26,102 --> 01:24:28,873
About the camera a little.

678
01:24:32,464 --> 01:24:34,580
To see wait a little, soon followed.

679
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,474
The mother who bore!

680
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:59,393
Sometimes it can seem as hard as you want!
