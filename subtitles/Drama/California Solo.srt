1
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,199
Welcome to another
addition of "Flame-Outs. "

2
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:17,434
The show where
we consider the tragic

3
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:18,969
and sometimes
spectacular deaths

4
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,938
of the world's
greatest musicians.

5
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,639
I am your host,
Lachlan MacAldonich.

6
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,257
I know you can do it.

7
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,492
But the market is
special, all right.

8
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:44,760
Okay, it's about talking
to the customers

9
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:46,963
and Lachlan has a
way with them.

10
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:48,998
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,767
You gotta rotate,
a higher rotate.

12
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:56,672
Back up a little bit.

13
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:58,808
Good.

14
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,621
How we doing tonight, Sir?

15
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:48,623
Fuck-a-duck.

16
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,990
Where were you heading?

17
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:51,725
Home.

18
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:53,894
Where are you coming from?

19
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:56,430
A bar.

20
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,299
Out of the car, please.

21
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,301
Yes.

22
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:07,741
You're gonna go against
that wall,

23
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,743
against that chart.

24
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,978
Against the wall.

25
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,047
Look at me, please.

26
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,082
I knew that.

27
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,985
Okay, here we go.

28
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,353
To your right, please.

29
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:22,622
Is that badass, that look?

30
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,991
Come on, let's get
one taken together.

31
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,559
I don't think so.

32
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,762
Well, Mister McAldon...

33
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:32,332
MacAldonich, Lachlan
MacAldonich.

34
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,800
Is that Irish?

35
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,969
Excuse me,
I am from Scotland.

36
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,439
We have your BAC level
written down here

37
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,674
at point-two-four.

38
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:43,009
That is an aggravated DUl,

39
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:45,011
which means that your license
is suspended,

40
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,480
effective immediately.

41
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,452
Four months for one DUl.

42
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:53,586
What a crock.

43
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:54,721
I tell you, Warren.

44
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,823
You see, back in the UK
they would have

45
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:00,126
dumped me on the front
step and rang the bell.

46
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,695
Well, maybe when
I was a kid.

47
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:03,963
Yeah, here too.

48
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:07,100
That's...
that's that's bullshit.

49
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:10,770
Well, what am I gonna
do about Saturday now?

50
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:14,106
Shit.

51
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:16,408
Goddamn DUl.

52
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,676
What the hell, man, I...

53
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:21,112
I thought you
were smarter than that.

54
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,959
Oh, shut up.

55
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,674
You know,
in a previous life,

56
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:54,078
I'd only get to see this side
of Saturday in the arse end.

57
00:04:56,948 --> 00:05:00,518
Bet you had some crazy
nights back in the day, huh?

58
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,754
Yeah...
Ancient history now.

59
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:07,992
Yeah, I know.

60
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:10,594
Fuck off.

61
00:05:18,436 --> 00:05:20,036
This guy comes home
one day, right?

62
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,538
He says to his wife,

63
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,473
"There's a rumor going
around at work

64
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:26,609
"that the postman has had sex
with every woman on this street

65
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:28,144
except one. "

66
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,679
And she says, "I bet
it's that stuck-up co-ed

67
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,080
at number fifty-six. "

68
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:54,670
Oh, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

69
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,138
Ain't that always
the way?

70
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,139
How about a radish?

71
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:58,774
- Radish?
- Yeah.

72
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,142
I know it sounds crazy.

73
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,678
Try a little salt, a
little butter, fantastic.

74
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,979
Yeah, you cook?

75
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:04,980
I don't cook.

76
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:06,548
A customer told me.

77
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,817
You all right
there, my friend?

78
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,486
I see you've been eyeing
these eggs?

79
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:12,688
How many
would you like?

80
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,157
These eggs are laid
with love.

81
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:16,592
Happy chickens.

82
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:20,761
Cage free, chemical free,
hormone free.

83
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,963
Matter of fact, the only thing
that ain't free is the cost.

84
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,264
Four dollars
for the dozen.

85
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,832
Thank you very much.

86
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:25,833
All right, Beau?

87
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:26,834
Hey, Lachlan...
How you doin'?

88
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,870
Good...
What's good today?

89
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:29,971
Thank you, Sir.

90
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,139
Tomatoes are spectacular.

91
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,141
"Peachy" tomatoes.

92
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,843
- Yeah... Peachy?
- Yeah.

93
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:39,180
I think you can do
better than that sign.

94
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,249
They'll work with the sea
bass I just picked up.

95
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:44,852
I have some mushrooms,
lemon, and capers.

96
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:47,121
Very tasty.

97
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,891
Well, work's been really
slow lately,

98
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:52,193
so I've had
plenty of time to cook

99
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,061
pathetically elaborate
dinners.

100
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,062
That's perfect.

101
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,531
When do I get to
try one?

102
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,765
I told you, when I get
an invite to your farm.

103
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,268
You have had
an invite for months.

104
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,237
Oh, by the way, my
boyfriend is here.

105
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,039
He, uh, he usually works
late Friday nights,

106
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,641
so he can't make it,

107
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,943
but I dragged his ass out of
bed this morning.

108
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,945
Hey, Paul...

109
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,880
Come here.

110
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,715
Look, if you do want
to come,

111
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:15,715
it's quite simple really.

112
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:18,685
If you leave at the
ass-crack of dawn.

113
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,119
Yes, thank you very
much, Julian, thank you.

114
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,887
Back to work.

115
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,822
Thanks.

116
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,225
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, um, Paul this is Lachlan.

117
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:27,226
Nice to meet you.

118
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:28,327
You're both musicians.

119
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,342
- Oh yeah, what do you play?
- I'm a DJ.

120
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,231
- A really good one.
- Right.

121
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,166
Some good stuff in
the bins over there.

122
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,602
Yeah, I just found The Beach
Boys "Sunflower" over there.

123
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,870
Classic.

124
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:38,971
Hell of a lot better than
"Pet Sounds",

125
00:07:38,973 --> 00:07:39,972
if you ask me.

126
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,840
A fellow
contrarian, I see.

127
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,142
Absolutely.

128
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:44,743
Did you get a coffee?

129
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,811
I did not get a coffee

130
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:46,879
'cause the coffee guy's
too slow

131
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,781
and I couldn't
wait any longer.

132
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:49,982
You ready to go?

133
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:52,051
Yeah... I'm just gonna get
these and, yeah.

134
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,587
Well, it's nice to see you
this morning, Beau.

135
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:55,721
Nice to
meet you too, Paul.

136
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,890
- I'm gonna go pay for
that record. - Cool.

137
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:58,891
What's the
damage on these?

138
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,125
Oh, just make that a buck.

139
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,660
- No.
- I'm telling you.

140
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:02,995
Thank you.

141
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,063
There you go.

142
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:06,699
All right, Robinson Farm,
Road 28.

143
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,167
I'll sleep with
one eye open.

144
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,234
Okay.

145
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,669
See ya.

146
00:08:10,671 --> 00:08:12,204
Bye.

147
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,309
All right, my friends,

148
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,678
Some lovely carrots here,
some lovely zucchini.

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,080
We've got...

150
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,248
You ready?

151
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,818
Yep.

152
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,721
Drive downtown.

153
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:30,722
Where to?

154
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,857
Towards the tall
buildings.

155
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,826
What for?

156
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,662
I want to stop somewhere
before we go home.

157
00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:44,801
You took the FST.

158
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:46,069
I'm sorry, I
took the what?

159
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:48,138
Field Sobriety Test.

160
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,773
Yeah, well he had me get
out of the car

161
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,742
and stand on one leg.

162
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:53,210
If I hadn't been
so drunk,

163
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:55,379
I'd have probably found the
whole thing rather humiliating.

164
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,814
And I probably would've
passed it as well.

165
00:08:57,816 --> 00:08:59,383
There's no such
thing as passing those tests.

166
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,684
No matter what you do,

167
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:01,885
it's just more evidence
against you.

168
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,754
You should
never agree to them.

169
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,023
Well that's good
to know, now.

170
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,724
Thanks.

171
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,993
Okay.

172
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:12,362
If we plead guilty,
I do my courtroom thing,

173
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,265
I can probably get you four
months suspended license

174
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,701
plus a fine
in the neighborhood

175
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,002
$4,000. or $5,000.

176
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,937
Wow.

177
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,005
That's the best
you're gonna get.

178
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,040
Oh, one other thing.

179
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,241
What's your
immigration status?

180
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:26,375
Permanent legal resident.

181
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,110
Got a green card,
been here for years.

182
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,879
Good...
No prior arrests?

183
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:31,814
One.

184
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:32,882
You have a prior?

185
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:34,717
Arrest or conviction?

186
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,052
Half an ounce
of marijuana or something.

187
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,687
It was a long, long
time ago.

188
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:38,888
But you're gonna need to
speak to an immigration lawyer.

189
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,790
I have a guy I recommend,
David Piper,

190
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,792
and I'll see if he can see you
first thing Monday morning.

191
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,326
Yeah, but I- I'm a
permanent legal resident.

192
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,300
- I got a green card.
- No, doesn't matter.

193
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,998
You should talk to Piper,
he's the guy.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,268
Uh, oh, one last thing,
and this is important.

195
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,371
Do not drive while
your license is suspended.

196
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:57,440
We don't want to have a bad
situation get worse.

197
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:59,909
Okay?

198
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,866
- You all right?
- Yeah.

199
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:26,867
You mind if I go
hang out?

200
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:27,868
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,869
All right.

202
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,471
Enjoy yourself,
have fun.

203
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,532
We have a winner!

204
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,768
Jacob Welsh.

205
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,075
There's a bunch of kids
out there stuffing their face

206
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:09,476
with cherry pies.

207
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:14,782
Am I the only one that
finds that vaguely disturbing?

208
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,884
I met with your lawyer
friend today.

209
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,552
He seems
like a decent guy.

210
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:21,955
I'll probably have to consult
with an immigration lawyer now.

211
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,090
What the hell's
that mean?

212
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:24,158
You're illegal?

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,259
Fuck off, Warren.

214
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,425
I'm practically
American these days.

215
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:29,095
They wouldn't
recognize me back home.

216
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:34,100
Did you see Melodie
out there today?

217
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,170
No.

218
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,838
She's like flippin'
that baton...

219
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,206
Boom!

220
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,907
Grabbed it out of the air
every single time,

221
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,241
never dropped it once.

222
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:45,110
But I remember Julian back
in the day, you know,

223
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:48,413
he's like out there dressed up
like a little cherry tree.

224
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,248
And he's, you know,

225
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,484
he's giving it everything
he's got, you know.

226
00:11:52,486 --> 00:11:56,288
And it's like, every year
I dread coming to this thing.

227
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,024
And then I get here and I see
my kids and the parade

228
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,194
and I'm just, you know...

229
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,399
Hey, I'm...
I'm sorry, man.

230
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,867
Oh.

231
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:10,202
Not at all, Warren.

232
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,337
That's an absolutely
beautiful sentiment, brother.

233
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,172
Cheers.

234
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:32,623
Welcome to another
edition of "Flame-Outs".

235
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,459
The show where we
discuss the tragic

236
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,561
and sometimes
spectacular deaths

237
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,430
of the world's greatest
musicians.

238
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,899
I am your host,
Lachlan MacAldonich.

239
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:44,368
Tonight, Marc Bolan,
of T. Rex.

240
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:48,136
Back in the 1970's this guy was
the biggest star in the UK.

241
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,040
Immensely talented.

242
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,443
His car hit a tree
outside London

243
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:54,044
when he was just shy of 30.

244
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:56,280
His poor
wife was driving.

245
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:59,283
Some would say that
Marc Bolan truly met his end

246
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,185
nine days previously when,

247
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,087
during his
last public appearance,

248
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,155
he slipped and fell over
on the TV

249
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,457
in front of millions.

250
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:07,992
His old pal, David Bowie,

251
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:09,994
standing there beside
him laughing,

252
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,462
already well on
his way to a lifetime

253
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,264
of Ziggy stardom.

254
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:17,367
But, this broadcast
is about tragedy.

255
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:19,402
And what could
be more tragic in the annals

256
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,971
of British Rock than
Marc Bolan?

257
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:24,107
A rocker with
a genuinely good heart

258
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:27,543
who became all flabby
and egotistical.

259
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,912
Man, he broke some
hearts back in the day.

260
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,580
Including mine.

261
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,348
I must have listened to
this record at least

262
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,119
10,000 times.

263
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,655
But hey, I promised I wouldn't
talk about myself

264
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:41,957
on "Flame-Outs" until
I'm actually dead.

265
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,361
So, in the meantime,
let's just stick to Marc Bolan.

266
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,276
Tell me about your
prior conviction.

267
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,611
Well, it's all a bit
of a blur now, really.

268
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,313
More than
fifteen years ago.

269
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,717
But I was getting on a plane,
next thing you know,

270
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,652
I'm getting
taken in for grass.

271
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:46,653
Drugs.

272
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,488
Yeah.

273
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:50,702
Had them in my bag.
Stupid.

274
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,994
Anyway, I was in a
band at the time.

275
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,629
And our manager,
he sorted it.

276
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,665
He... No more than a
speeding ticket,

277
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,133
he said at the time.

278
00:15:00,135 --> 00:15:03,003
Yeah, you
got a good manager.

279
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,338
Uh, what kind of visa
were you on?

280
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,507
I don't remember.

281
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,143
H-1-B?

282
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:12,212
0-1

283
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:14,180
0-1.

284
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,515
0-1.

285
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:17,250
"Extraordinary ability",
something like that, yeah.

286
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,451
Oh, those are tough to get.

287
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,552
I know.

288
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,755
You wouldn't think to
look at me now.

289
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:25,025
- Wow.
- Yeah.

290
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,761
Well, look, uh,
all right.

291
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:31,131
Here's the issue as I see
it right now, okay?

292
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:35,134
Um, under
current immigration law,

293
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:39,304
both the DUl and possibly this
prior drug conviction

294
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,740
count as
violations of moral turpitude.

295
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,777
I- I'm sorry
to interrupt you, um,

296
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,379
I'm just a bit confused about
the immigration side of this.

297
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,281
I've got a green card.

298
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,283
I mean, surely that means
I'm practically a citizen here.

299
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,284
No.

300
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:53,719
Not at all.

301
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,487
You can face removal
proceedings whether you have

302
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,622
a green card or not.

303
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:58,424
It doesn't matter.

304
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:01,093
Shit.

305
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:03,195
Look...

306
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,098
No offense to
anyone, you know.

307
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,266
But I ain't a terrorist.

308
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,667
I'm not a drug mule.

309
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,235
Uh, I'm a moderately
lazy Scotsman.

310
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,205
I just... I just want to live
out the rest of my days

311
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,474
in this lovely
land I've called my home

312
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,678
for the last 12 years.

313
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,647
I can help you.

314
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,817
Good, great.

315
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,486
How much do I owe you?

316
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,656
Well, in these cases I
normally work on an hourly rate.

317
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,592
But I think in your case it's
more cost effective

318
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,359
to go with a flat fee.

319
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,761
Right, okay.

320
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,362
How much is that?

321
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,164
$5,000.

322
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,835
Half up front and, uh, half
when we're done.

323
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,418
Oh, it's Lachlan.

324
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,240
Hey, Wendell!

325
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,307
Look at you, man!

326
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,243
Look at your hair.

327
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,345
Well, that's the music
business, isn't it?

328
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,280
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you, man.

329
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,581
- How you been?
- I've been well.

330
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,383
- I've been well, yeah.
- Fantastic, okay.

331
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,218
Oh, God, you know, I was in
London last week.

332
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,685
I was at this event with
like Mick and Rod Stewart,

333
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:38,820
all of them,

334
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:40,488
and all they could talk
about, Lachlan,

335
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,790
was how fucked
the music business is.

336
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,493
Poor Mick, probably taken
the scrambled flamingo eggs

337
00:17:45,495 --> 00:17:46,594
off the rider.

338
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:47,829
- Flamingo egg whites, mate.
- Oh, yeah.

339
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:49,497
Very fit bastard.

340
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:50,765
Makes Iggy look fat.

341
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:53,268
For sure.

342
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,269
How you doin', you
all right?

343
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,904
Yeah, I'm well,
I'm well.

344
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,805
Not playing
so much anymore.

345
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,742
No rolling stone, I'm afraid,
too much moss.

346
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,943
But I'm keeping busy.

347
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:02,944
Doing a lot of
broadcasting at the moment.

348
00:18:02,946 --> 00:18:03,945
Good, good.

349
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:06,481
Well, it's a podcast,
in actual fact.

350
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:08,216
But I, like, discuss
the spectacular deaths

351
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,351
of the world's great
musicians.

352
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:14,656
Marvin Gaye, Janis
Joplin, Serge Gainsbourg.

353
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,925
Lindsay Lohan.

354
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,627
Did you do a show on Jed?

355
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,731
No, not yet, no.

356
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:28,469
Fuck, Wendell, to
be honest,

357
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,804
it's more
of a hobby, really.

358
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:30,872
Right.

359
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,307
Well, what do
you do for work?

360
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,708
Actually... sorry.

361
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,513
Do you recall
that marijuana charge

362
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,447
that you helped to
get us out of,

363
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,649
way back in
the '96 Glass Houses tour?

364
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:44,418
No.

365
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,786
Okay, LAX.

366
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,633
- I had some weed in my bag.
- Oh, geez...

367
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:50,044
Stupidly stuck it through the
X- ray machine like an idiot.

368
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:51,566
Yeah, I remember.

369
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,860
Well, that
small misdemeanor,

370
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,429
coupled with a recent DUl,

371
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:56,530
means I might
be getting kicked out

372
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,599
of the good ol' US of A.

373
00:18:58,601 --> 00:18:59,900
That's fucking terrible.

374
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,401
Yeah, well, I've got a
lawyer who thinks

375
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:02,502
he might be
able to help me,

376
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:06,739
but uh,
his fee is $5,000.

377
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:11,310
Fuck.

378
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,679
Wendell.

379
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:14,747
Come on, man.

380
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,315
You're the only friend
I have left

381
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:17,750
whose house I have to
drive up a considerable incline

382
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:20,820
Lachlan, I've told
you a thousand times...

383
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,821
I know... I know what
you said,

384
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,456
and my
house is in order,

385
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,491
but it's just a tiny, wee
fucking house, that's all.

386
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:26,759
Yeah, well, you
just got to have some money

387
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:28,327
under the fucking bed,
okay, Lachlan.

388
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,963
Okay, right...

389
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:33,532
I work on a farm.

390
00:19:33,534 --> 00:19:34,667
I don't mind my life.

391
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:35,968
I don't mind it at
all, in fact, but...

392
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,905
I've got less than
$1,200 in the bank.

393
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:42,841
I don't even have
a credit card.

394
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:46,511
I've got money coming in,
Wendell, I can pay you back.

395
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:50,515
I just cannot go back
to the UK.

396
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:53,652
Nothing for me there.

397
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:58,356
And you understand that,
don't you, man?

398
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,992
Yes, I understand
that, man.

399
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:02,060
Do you ever go back?

400
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:03,061
- No.
- Never?

401
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:05,430
Never.

402
00:20:05,432 --> 00:20:07,465
Then why the fuck did
you come to me?

403
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,833
'Cause you...
Why the fuck...?

404
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:11,303
Fuck, 'cause you're
Johnny-on-the-spot, aren't you?

405
00:20:11,305 --> 00:20:12,837
Thrive in a crisis,
and all of that.

406
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:14,372
To wit, the old
drug charge.

407
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:16,641
Yeah, Johnny-on-the-spot,
that's good.

408
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:20,521
I cleaned up every shit pile you
ever trod in, and your mates.

409
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,780
- Right, didn't I?
- Yeah.

410
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,481
- That was me doing that.
- I know.

411
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,550
Except the last one.

412
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:27,852
You've cost me, boy.

413
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:32,857
You've cost me a lot more
than five grand.

414
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:35,459
Yeah, well, I think we made you
quite a bit as well, Wendell.

415
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:36,927
Your brother made it,
all right?

416
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:38,729
Your fucking brother
made me the money.

417
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:39,897
Not you.

418
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:42,799
It wasn't about the money.

419
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:45,635
You see, what you've got
to understand is,

420
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,003
I haven't
given you a thought.

421
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:49,105
I didn't know whether you
were alive or dead.

422
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:51,374
- Cheers.
- That's right.

423
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,110
And I was never your
manager, you see, Lachlan.

424
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,612
I was never your
fucking friend.

425
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,881
Jed was the band.

426
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,051
So if they send you back
to England,

427
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,554
I think it would
be about fucking time.

428
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,863
Take care of yourself.

429
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:22,505
You tight-fisted
mother fucker.

430
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:23,506
Five grand.

431
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:26,709
Open the fucking gate!

432
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:31,447
Five grand,
you fucking wank?

433
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:33,783
Fucking dick.
Hurry up!

434
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,121
Fuck.

435
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:48,430
The people of the state of
California

436
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,132
have charged
you with one count of violating

437
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,969
California Vehicle Code section
23-152-A,

438
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:56,905
driving under the influence
of alcohol or a drug.

439
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:59,574
And with one count
of violating Vehicle Code

440
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,910
section 23-152-B

441
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:03,878
driving with
a blood alcohol content

442
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,480
of point-zero-eight percent
or greater.

443
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:08,149
These are misdemeanors and
carry with them

444
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,152
a maximum punishment of six
months imprisonment.

445
00:22:11,154 --> 00:22:12,586
How do you plead?

446
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,088
Not guilty, your honor.

447
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,790
Defendant pleads
not guilty.

448
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,993
We'll set the pre-trial hearing
for approximately 30 days...

449
00:22:24,699 --> 00:22:27,668
Two shots, please.

450
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,869
Rough day, huh?

451
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:30,805
Tell me about it.

452
00:22:35,544 --> 00:22:36,544
Yep.

453
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:39,046
Totally shite fucking day.

454
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:03,970
Oh, fuck me.

455
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,083
There we go.

456
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,918
That'll be five dollars.

457
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,493
Hey, Beau.

458
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:27,961
Hey, Paul.

459
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:29,062
Two weeks runnin', eh?

460
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:30,063
Yeah.

461
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,063
How were the tomatoes?

462
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:34,500
Thank you for
pushing them on me.

463
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,536
Beau didn't uh, tell me
who you were last week.

464
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:40,038
Who am I?

465
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,108
Well, I was spinning
at a party that night

466
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,210
and I put on a song from
"Bank Street Waltz"

467
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:48,746
by The Cranks.

468
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,248
And I'm looking at the
back of the album,

469
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,016
the band photo.

470
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:55,253
And I'm like, holy shit.

471
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:57,722
There you are standing
right next to Jed.

472
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,224
The guy from the fucking
farmer's market.

473
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:01,826
Man, "Bank Street Waltz"
is literally

474
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,628
my favorite
album of all time.

475
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,862
Yeah.

476
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,098
He hasn't stopped talking
about it all week.

477
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,566
Look, I'm doing a party
in a few weeks

478
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:09,600
at Three of Clubs.

479
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:10,601
You gotta come.

480
00:24:10,603 --> 00:24:11,802
No, thanks for the invite,

481
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,204
but I don't do anything
like that anymore.

482
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,039
Anything like what?

483
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,008
Anything interesting.

484
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,976
Oh, it's all you know, your
kind of stuff, man.

485
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:21,913
You see, Blur, Stone
Roses, Black Grape, Oasis.

486
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,314
Look, if you come, I'll
play the whole the entire

487
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,715
side one of
"Bank Street Waltz".

488
00:24:24,717 --> 00:24:25,850
No, you know, I- I've
heard quite enough

489
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:27,051
of that album, thank you.

490
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:28,052
No, seriously.

491
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:29,053
You gotta come.

492
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:30,054
I really don't want
to, man.

493
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:31,055
Babe.

494
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,056
He can't make it.

495
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,057
Shh...
He's coming.

496
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,225
Shh?

497
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:38,162
He doesn't want to.

498
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:41,666
All right, look,
if you change your mind,

499
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,301
it's Three of Clubs
next month.

500
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:47,638
And um, you know, we'll
make you the guest of honor.

501
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,106
It's gonna be amazing.

502
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:50,307
I hope... I hope you
change your mind.

503
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:51,975
It's really nice
to meet you.

504
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:53,109
Seriously.

505
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,778
It's a pleasure,
it's an honor.

506
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,845
I'm really sorry
about your brother, man.

507
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:56,846
Cheers...
I appreciate that.

508
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,082
Yeah... Cheers.

509
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:17,700
So, you were a big
deal back in the day?

510
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:20,069
I was the guitar player
in a big deal band,

511
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:23,105
for a moment, yeah.

512
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,774
How come you never
said anything?

513
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,143
You ever heard of
The Cranks?

514
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,345
No.

515
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:31,714
So what do you want
me to say?

516
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,715
I don't know.

517
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,116
Something.

518
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:35,317
"I play guitar.

519
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,786
I'm a big fucking deal. "

520
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,755
Something like that.

521
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:42,691
Jesus Christ.

522
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:44,226
I didn't think it was
that bad, actually.

523
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:45,761
Fuck off,
it's "not that bad. "

524
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:47,730
24 months probation.

525
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:48,964
$5,000 fine.

526
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,666
Four months in prison.

527
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,634
It's a first plea offer.

528
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,836
We can push back
on the prison time.

529
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:59,340
Okay, but we can't go any
further with that

530
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,743
until we find out
what is gonna work best

531
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:03,378
for your immigration
situation.

532
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,346
Yeah, I know,
I understand that.

533
00:26:05,348 --> 00:26:08,416
He says you still haven't
gotten back to him.

534
00:26:08,864 --> 00:26:10,357
I'm trying, man.
It's just...

535
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:12,887
I know, I'm sorry.

536
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:17,792
I just don't have
the money.

537
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:19,727
Okay, I...
I understand.

538
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,729
This is what he said
he could do for you.

539
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:23,331
He'll take a thousand
up front,

540
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,899
as a consultation fee.

541
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,901
And then a thousand more to
be paid at a later date.

542
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:31,088
But we've got to get him
on board right away.

543
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,209
I understand.

544
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,388
I'm possibly interested in
selling an old guitar of mine.

545
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,793
It's a Les Paul 90-60
Sunburst.

546
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:55,361
How much will one
of those go for nowadays?

547
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,263
Well, that depends on what
kind of shape it's in.

548
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:59,965
Well, have you heard
of The Cranks, my friend?

549
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,034
Doesn't ring a bell.

550
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:03,135
No?

551
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:07,306
Album called
"Bank Street Waltz"?

552
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,942
"Glass Houses?"

553
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:11,944
No.

554
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,279
Well, they said that
the lead singer

555
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,915
was the British Kurt Cobain.

556
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,784
I thought that was
nonsense, but anyhow...

557
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,754
I... I'm not too big
on British bands.

558
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,757
Well, it was used by the
lead guitarist of The Cranks.

559
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,959
He bought it directly from
Paul Weller of The Jam,

560
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,962
who played
it before him.

561
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,198
You're familiar with
The Jam?

562
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,869
You work
in a music store.

563
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,405
Let me guess, you're
the guy from...

564
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,974
The Cranks...
I was, yeah.

565
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:43,309
So what kind of
condition is it in?

566
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:44,810
Trust me, man.

567
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:46,879
This guitar is of
royal lineage.

568
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:49,115
It's steeped
in musical history.

569
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:52,384
Well, my partner is the vintage
guitar buff around here.

570
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:53,953
Trying to move it fast?

571
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,121
Well, when you finish
gauging interest,

572
00:27:56,123 --> 00:27:57,254
why don't you
just bring it on by,

573
00:27:57,256 --> 00:27:59,389
we'll take a look at it.

574
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,992
Sure, I'll do that.

575
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,762
Thank you.

576
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:10,367
You fucking loser,
you fucking loser.

577
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,235
I'm sorry I didn't
make it back.

578
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:22,038
I'll be in bright and
early tomorrow, I promise.

579
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:36,484
- Yeah, hello?
- Lachlan?

580
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,639
- Yep.
- It's Beau.

581
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,590
From the farmer's market.

582
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:43,750
Beau, how ya doin'?
Yeah, of course.

583
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,479
I forgot you gave me your phone
number a few months ago.

584
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:50,583
Yeah, well, yeah,
I forgot too, completely.

585
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:53,134
I was thinking that
tomorrow I might just want

586
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:56,371
to get in my car
and drive.

587
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,373
Uh, could I come
check out the farm?

588
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,474
I tell you what, tomorrow
it just so happens

589
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:02,509
to be my day off, so you're
welcome to come

590
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,144
any time you like.

591
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,213
Okay, yeah, sure.

592
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,494
Thank you.

593
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:23,364
Hey... Welcome.

594
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:25,366
All right.

595
00:30:25,368 --> 00:30:29,136
So this is where
all my food comes from.

596
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:31,605
Well, actually this row
here, see the empty row,

597
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,574
you eat all of that.

598
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,943
So, how did you
start working here?

599
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:38,012
I grew up on a farm.

600
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:41,181
I actually know how
to do some of this stuff.

601
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:43,984
A few years ago when an
opportunity came up,

602
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:47,354
I thought,
back to my roots.

603
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:50,057
And what
do you do here?

604
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:52,693
Are you immigration
or something?

605
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:54,093
- No.
- A lot of questions.

606
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:56,930
I'm just...
I am... I'm curious.

607
00:30:56,932 --> 00:30:58,998
Well, I am, in actual
fact, the manager.

608
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Oh.

609
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,167
Warren sells
loads of these, you know,

610
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:04,403
direct-to-the-consumer
baskets.

611
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,004
I deal with those and
also handle

612
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:08,140
the wholesale orders.

613
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,208
How do I sign up
for a basket?

614
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,710
Well, I could tell you,

615
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,378
but then you wouldn't
have to come to the market

616
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,948
every Saturday.

617
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,449
True.

618
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,952
That is true.

619
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:22,287
So here we
have Burt and Doris.

620
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,555
Oh-ho.

621
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,724
The mental chickens.

622
00:31:25,726 --> 00:31:27,092
Want to
help me feed them?

623
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,161
Um, I think I'm...
I'm good.

624
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:30,162
Thanks.

625
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:33,632
I'm good.

626
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:35,067
Watch this,
I'll just be a second.

627
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:37,002
Okay.

628
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:38,537
Get back, beasts.

629
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,034
Great.

630
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,335
No skill required.

631
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:12,336
You're cheating.

632
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:13,571
I know you're cheating.

633
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,211
I didn't cheat
that time.

634
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,779
But you know,
anything for a win.

635
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:24,080
Warren, I want to see you,

636
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,682
but I'm on my last
legs here, man.

637
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,751
Yeah?

638
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:30,754
Pretty active
for a school night, huh?

639
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:32,655
Ah, come on, Warren.

640
00:32:32,657 --> 00:32:34,591
I'm just having a drink.

641
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:40,096
All right.

642
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:41,765
I got your Gatorade.

643
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:46,770
So tell me...

644
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:50,173
why did you want
to come and see me today?

645
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,108
I don't know.

646
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,778
I guess I've had your farm's
address tacked up

647
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,313
on my fridge
for like months.

648
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:59,749
And every time I see
you I feel like

649
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:02,752
you're just
as sad as I am.

650
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:06,355
Oh...

651
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:07,356
Good night.

652
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,757
Night, night.

653
00:33:12,095 --> 00:33:16,432
You know, I don't-I don't
think I should drive.

654
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,600
Well, neither can I.

655
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,135
Listen, my place
ain't much,

656
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,470
but you're welcome to
come stay the night.

657
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:24,807
Oh, um...

658
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:25,841
It's cool.

659
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:27,109
Yeah?

660
00:33:27,111 --> 00:33:28,410
No pressure.

661
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,579
We can get a taxi.

662
00:33:30,581 --> 00:33:32,381
Okay?

663
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,452
Welcome.

664
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:38,620
You weren't kidding.

665
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,856
Well, I told you.

666
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:44,827
Well, it's not a
bad space,

667
00:33:44,829 --> 00:33:47,329
it's just, I don't know,

668
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,499
it needs a
little straightening up.

669
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,733
It's okay,
you can say it.

670
00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:56,304
It needs a woman's touch.

671
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,306
I think it's nice.

672
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,448
Do you still play?

673
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,417
No.

674
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:12,385
Is this the one
you played when...

675
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:15,689
Mm-hmm.

676
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:17,524
Will you
play me something?

677
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,192
No.

678
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,428
It's the best way to
impress a girl, you know.

679
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,731
I've been known to
use that tactic in my day.

680
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:26,233
Yeah, I'm sure.

681
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:35,809
You aren't
gonna give up, are ya?

682
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:38,178
Mm-mm.

683
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,380
Oh, fuck it...
Any requests?

684
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:42,382
No, you can choose.

685
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:43,683
My choice.

686
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:46,720
Well...

687
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:51,591
I did have a solo
album once the band broke up.

688
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:52,659
- It was called...
- I know.

689
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:55,562
I Googled
you last week.

690
00:34:55,564 --> 00:34:57,430
- "California Solo".
- Ooh...

691
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:59,399
You Googled me,
did you?

692
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,368
- Mm-hmm, guilty.
- Oh, my God.

693
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,470
Where has all
the mystery gone, Beau?

694
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:04,638
You know,
I remember the days

695
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,373
when people used to speak
to each other.

696
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,607
Old fashioned.

697
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,751
Okay.

698
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,430
I forget the words.

699
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,584
Wow.
It's been a while.

700
00:38:23,764 --> 00:38:25,998
That was beautiful.

701
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
Yeah?

702
00:38:31,572 --> 00:38:32,939
Hey.

703
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:34,974
Listen, you sleep in
the bed,

704
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:37,143
I'm gonna sleep here.

705
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:39,379
Oh, we can share
the bed.

706
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:41,681
I mean, we're
both grown-ups.

707
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:42,682
Yeah.

708
00:38:42,684 --> 00:38:44,717
Yeah, you're
absolutely right.

709
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,453
Um...

710
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:50,757
just so you know...

711
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:55,628
nothing is going to
happen tonight.

712
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,629
No.

713
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:59,065
God, of course
not, no.

714
00:39:02,836 --> 00:39:05,805
Right.

715
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:06,939
Long day.

716
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:09,075
I'm drunk.

717
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:31,496
What do you think?

718
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:32,631
Underdeveloped.

719
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:33,732
Yeah.

720
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:35,500
But, by how much?

721
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:37,102
Couple of days,
maybe a week.

722
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:40,071
I don't know.

723
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:41,573
Yeah, see.

724
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:45,110
Shit, I need to
take this.

725
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:47,211
Yeah, Mister Domenico.

726
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:51,215
Okay.

727
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,518
And what is it?

728
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:57,888
Probation?

729
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,527
I'll have to go
to court.

730
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:09,099
Okay.

731
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:11,702
All right, cheers.

732
00:40:11,704 --> 00:40:13,971
Bye-bye.

733
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:15,840
Well, well.

734
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,909
Are you gonna keep us
in suspense?

735
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:21,778
No.

736
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,946
I got the plea bargain.

737
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:26,749
I'm not
gonna get deported.

738
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:28,084
Then I guess we're
stuck with ya.

739
00:40:28,086 --> 00:40:30,119
Unfortunately, for you.

740
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:32,622
Even more unfortunate
for you, my friend.

741
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:38,695
Lachlan Mac...

742
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:39,829
MacAldonich.

743
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,598
It's Lachlan MacAldonich.

744
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,932
Tough name to say.

745
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,767
Never take
the easy road.

746
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,536
- I'm Carol Brody...
- Hi, Carol.

747
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:48,104
...your probation officer.

748
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:50,907
- Right this way.
- Sure.

749
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:56,112
I'm with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement,

750
00:40:56,114 --> 00:40:57,614
I need you to come with
me, please, sir.

751
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,282
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what's this?

752
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,817
We'll explain
everything.

753
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:01,885
Miss Brody?

754
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:03,553
ICE put a hold
on you.

755
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,821
You have
to go with them.

756
00:41:04,823 --> 00:41:06,122
So, what is this...
So, is this a trap, yeah?

757
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,057
It's standard
procedure, sir.

758
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:09,859
Well, you haven't even read
me my rights yet.

759
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:11,094
Because you're not
being arrested,

760
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:12,662
you're just being detained,
Mister McDonald.

761
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,101
Okay, name.

762
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:20,601
Lachlan MacAldonich.

763
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,602
Date of birth.

764
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,237
First of April, 1969.

765
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,238
All right.

766
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,606
Place of birth.

767
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:28,309
It's Kilmarnock in
Scotland, in the UK.

768
00:41:29,845 --> 00:41:32,813
K- I-L-M-A-R-N-O-C-K.

769
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,284
Marital status.

770
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,886
Divorced.

771
00:41:38,888 --> 00:41:41,155
Any children?

772
00:41:41,157 --> 00:41:44,058
Yeah, a daughter.

773
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,961
Her age?

774
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,830
Thirteen, I think.

775
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:51,265
Occupation.

776
00:41:51,267 --> 00:41:54,168
Agricultural worker.

777
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,673
All right,
Mister MacAldonich...

778
00:41:58,675 --> 00:41:59,907
do you know why you've
been detained?

779
00:41:59,909 --> 00:42:01,876
I haven't
got a fucking clue.

780
00:42:01,878 --> 00:42:03,244
Well, your case was
referred to this division

781
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,646
after your conviction
on a DUl...

782
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,848
To initiate
removal proceedings.

783
00:42:11,286 --> 00:42:12,853
Sir, this
is a fucking joke.

784
00:42:12,855 --> 00:42:14,689
But I've already sorted
all this out with my lawyer.

785
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:17,258
Wanna watch your language,
please, Sir?

786
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,594
Now this is
your notice to appear.

787
00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:20,895
In about two or
three weeks

788
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:23,997
check with your lawyers for
the exact date.

789
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,600
A judge... I'm sorry, I... I
don't want this.

790
00:42:26,602 --> 00:42:28,368
This is a...
This is a fucking mistake.

791
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,036
Those are your charging
papers for immigration court,

792
00:42:30,038 --> 00:42:31,338
so you're
gonna need those.

793
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,106
Yeah, but man, it's
a mistake.

794
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:35,375
Not my problem, sir.

795
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:41,147
Okay, can I go now,
please?

796
00:42:41,149 --> 00:42:43,148
No, you can't.

797
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,052
You have a bond posted
for $10,000.

798
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:48,921
I thought you said that I
hadn't been arrested.

799
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,790
It's not bail,
it's a bond.

800
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:52,891
Now if you need,

801
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:54,994
we have a list
of local bail bondsman

802
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:56,929
who will post bonds for
immigration removal cases.

803
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:59,698
I recommend you call
one of them.

804
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:05,337
Do you mind if I
make a phone call from here?

805
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,940
Yeah, go ahead.

806
00:43:07,942 --> 00:43:09,174
Let me call my lawyers.

807
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:10,709
Tear 'em
a new asshole.

808
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:12,811
Well, well I thought we
took this plea deal

809
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,747
in order to avoid this.

810
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:16,248
Well, it's not
an exact science.

811
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,651
You make a judgment
based on case law...

812
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,953
Well, well nobody told me
when I was signing up for this

813
00:43:20,955 --> 00:43:22,655
that you
were fucking guessing!

814
00:43:22,657 --> 00:43:23,888
All right, calm down...

815
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,390
No, don't tell me to
calm down, Mister Piper.

816
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:27,325
Don't tell me
to calm down, mate.

817
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,127
I took your sound
legal advice.

818
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:31,262
I paid for your
sound legal advice,

819
00:43:31,264 --> 00:43:32,897
and you've stuck me in
a raft and sold me

820
00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:34,432
right up the fucking river.

821
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:35,667
We're not
there quite yet.

822
00:43:35,669 --> 00:43:36,701
You still
have a decent...

823
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:37,702
We are there.

824
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:38,870
We're here right
fucking now!

825
00:43:38,872 --> 00:43:40,104
Look at us!

826
00:43:40,106 --> 00:43:41,105
We are doing our
best to try and figure out...

827
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:42,340
Don't do
your fucking best!

828
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:43,908
You go fix this!

829
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,376
You will fix this or
you're gonna understand

830
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:48,346
why I was kicked out of
every fucking club in the UK!

831
00:43:48,348 --> 00:43:49,847
Do you get that?

832
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,249
I will not go back there!

833
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:53,951
I will fucking not
go back there!

834
00:43:58,724 --> 00:44:02,326
Okay... Okay.

835
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:06,364
Well uh, do you have
someone to post your bond?

836
00:44:06,366 --> 00:44:08,966
I tell you what.

837
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:11,169
You post my bond, friend-o.

838
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:14,071
I'm sorry,
that's against firm policy.

839
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:46,302
I got all these Mexicans
working on my farm,

840
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:48,838
and it's the Scottish guy that
gets into shit with immigration.

841
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,473
Warren, I'm sorry, man...
I'll pay you back.

842
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:52,808
Yeah, how
you gonna do that?

843
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,144
Is your boss planning
on giving you a raise?

844
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:32,814
Yeah, hello?

845
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:33,948
Hey, it's David Piper.

846
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,049
You got a sec?

847
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:40,521
Look, uh, I found out a little
bit more about your situation.

848
00:45:40,523 --> 00:45:42,523
Turns out it was
that old drug arrest.

849
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:46,093
Three ounces of marijuana found
on your person.

850
00:45:46,095 --> 00:45:49,496
It turns out they could've
deported you at any point

851
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,398
in the last fifteen years.

852
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:54,501
Then why didn't they?

853
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:57,471
Well, no one was
paying any attention.

854
00:45:57,473 --> 00:46:00,240
Basically, we
got two options.

855
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:04,144
Um, first one, you accept
the removal ruling,

856
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:06,980
you go back home,
and you never come back.

857
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:08,916
Oh, please, please don't
tell me I have to pack my bags.

858
00:46:08,918 --> 00:46:10,818
- Come on.
- No, no, not necessarily.

859
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,219
The second option is this.

860
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:14,521
It's something we call
extreme hardship.

861
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:17,157
We would basically have to
prove that your removal

862
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:19,326
from the country would
cause extreme hardship

863
00:46:19,328 --> 00:46:21,862
to a US citizen.

864
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:26,934
It's the only viable
choice we've got here.

865
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:29,402
Anyone you can think of?

866
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:32,371
I don't believe
there's anyone who gives a toss

867
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,473
whether I'm here or not.

868
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:03,928
Now that was The Cranks.

869
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:06,563
First track from the album
"Back Street Waltz".

870
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:09,366
I haven't listened to
this for many years, my friends,

871
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,635
but what a ball we had.

872
00:48:11,637 --> 00:48:13,604
What a ball.

873
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:18,509
I cannot humbly
call him one of the greats.

874
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:20,511
But fuck it, yes I can,

875
00:48:20,513 --> 00:48:24,248
because that's
exactly what he was.

876
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:28,018
Jed MacAldonich.

877
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,954
He never followed a single
rule from the moment

878
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:33,089
he was conceived.

879
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:38,593
Grew up listening to the records
of The Smiths, New Order.

880
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,464
When he was seventeen

881
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,700
he made a pilgrimage
to the Hacienda Night Club

882
00:48:44,702 --> 00:48:49,371
in Manchester with his
little brother in tow.

883
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:52,708
A few years later they were
playing The Hacienda.

884
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,215
They and The Cranks.

885
00:49:00,217 --> 00:49:03,418
We were The Cranks.

886
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,091
A couple years after that
we recorded an album

887
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:12,127
at Abbey Road Studios:

888
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,463
"Magical One".

889
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:19,167
But the death of Jed
MacAldonich did not happen

890
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,236
in England, my friends.

891
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,271
No.

892
00:49:23,273 --> 00:49:27,442
His demise came in a shining
death trap

893
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:31,713
we call
the Hollywood Hills.

894
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:35,082
Recording the third album,

895
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:40,254
his stupid little brother
brought in some bad drugs

896
00:49:40,256 --> 00:49:44,759
to keep him
going through the night.

897
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:49,363
He kept hassling Jed
to take it.

898
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:51,532
He didn't care
that Jed was determined

899
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:54,368
to go straight, you know?

900
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,637
To straighten out.

901
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:07,714
But the little brother,

902
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:11,584
he never
went back to the UK.

903
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:14,554
How could he?

904
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:19,459
How could he face
the family?

905
00:50:19,461 --> 00:50:23,163
Devastated fans.

906
00:50:23,165 --> 00:50:26,666
Angry friends.

907
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,636
He knew what he'd done.

908
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:33,206
And he didn't need anyone
to fucking tell him.

909
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:42,848
Jed's best
years were still to come.

910
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,284
We didn't see past that.

911
00:51:11,144 --> 00:51:12,778
Excuse me.

912
00:51:14,848 --> 00:51:17,483
Excuse me, hello?

913
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:19,284
Julian, customer.

914
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:21,364
- I'm busy.
- Oh, shit.

915
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:23,946
You okay?

916
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,427
- You okay? - Thanks. Yeah.
- Okay.

917
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,429
Two bucks, ma'am.

918
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,797
- Two?
- Yeah.

919
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,235
Thank you.

920
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:44,474
Oh, fuck.

921
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,409
Hey.

922
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:47,611
Slow day?

923
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:49,513
Well, I'm slow today.

924
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:52,249
That's for sure.

925
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:53,583
Everything okay?

926
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:55,585
Yeah, I'm fine.

927
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:56,887
How are you?

928
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:00,657
Not great.

929
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,760
Paul and I decided
to take a break.

930
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:06,530
I don't like the idea
of cooking just for myself.

931
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:13,403
Well, I eat.

932
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:14,938
Oh, you do, do you?

933
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,174
Mmm-hm, a lot, yes.

934
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,542
And I know that's all I
can help you with

935
00:52:18,544 --> 00:52:22,712
because I'm a shite cook.

936
00:52:22,714 --> 00:52:25,248
So, you would like to come
over for dinner.

937
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,217
No, no.

938
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,419
Well, yeah...
I mean, you said, you know,

939
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,855
you need another mouth
to feed.

940
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,557
Well, I do.

941
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:35,692
Okay, cool.

942
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,195
All right, I'll text you my
address.

943
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,329
Yeah, sure.

944
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:40,429
Find us something to eat
then, all right?

945
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:42,198
Right... Thanks.

946
00:52:43,934 --> 00:52:45,401
Hey, Julian.

947
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:46,368
Yeah.

948
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,469
I'm gonna be
staying in LA today.

949
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:48,571
No.

950
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:50,940
I'm not unloading the truck
by myself again.

951
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:53,742
Julian, listen, life is
happening to me, man.

952
00:52:53,744 --> 00:52:55,311
I'm powerless to stop it.

953
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:56,679
Yeah, well you're supposed
to be there to unload

954
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:59,782
the truck when
it gets back to the farm.

955
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:01,684
Come on... Hey.

956
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:09,224
My dad's gonna
be pissed.

957
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:11,926
I'll talk to him
in the morning, okay?

958
00:53:15,864 --> 00:53:16,998
Excuse me, my friend.

959
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,669
Um, does
Catherine Breem live here?

960
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:23,805
She doesn't
live here, no.

961
00:53:23,807 --> 00:53:25,707
Shit.

962
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:28,676
Well, she lived here
a few years back.

963
00:53:28,678 --> 00:53:31,613
I'm sorry
to bother you.

964
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:34,649
Hang on.

965
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:36,951
She's our landlord
we rent the house from.

966
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:38,686
Oh, right.

967
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:41,022
Do you know where
she happens to live now?

968
00:53:41,024 --> 00:53:43,590
I'm an old friend.

969
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:45,425
All right, let me give
you her number first.

970
00:53:45,427 --> 00:53:46,960
- You can...
- Thank you.

971
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:48,996
You can call her.

972
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:50,931
Fantastic...
Thank you so much.

973
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,605
Fuck-a-duck.

974
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:06,580
Hello?

975
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:08,282
- Hi, is that Catherine?
- Yeah.

976
00:54:08,284 --> 00:54:10,450
It's you-know-who.

977
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,720
Oh my...
Lachlan?

978
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:16,323
Yeah, how are you doin'?

979
00:54:16,325 --> 00:54:17,958
Hah!

980
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,828
Surprise,
sur-fucking-prise.

981
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:25,499
6-6-1... is
that where you're living?

982
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:26,767
Uh, it's Antelope Valley.

983
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:30,804
No, well at the moment,
actually, I'm smack bang

984
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:35,341
in the middle of
our old stomping ground.

985
00:54:35,343 --> 00:54:37,043
What for?

986
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:38,477
Well, I stopped by our
old place,

987
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:40,813
the guy told me
you'd moved.

988
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:42,682
And he gave you my number?

989
00:54:42,684 --> 00:54:45,317
Yeah, well it's
the accent, remember.

990
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:48,753
It causes Americans
to trust me.

991
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:50,088
Oh.

992
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,923
Is something wrong?

993
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:53,491
No, no, no, why?

994
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:55,493
Well, you're calling me.

995
00:54:56,829 --> 00:55:00,899
Okay, listen, can we meet
up somewhere?

996
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:05,470
Jesus, Lachlan.

997
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,472
Okay, fine, you know
what, I'm home right now.

998
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,841
So why don't you just
come on by.

999
00:55:09,843 --> 00:55:11,476
Perfect, perfect.

1000
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,411
What's the...
I'll get a pen.

1001
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:14,546
You need my address?

1002
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:17,082
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:19,751
Hold on, I've got one,
I've got one.

1004
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:22,687
No, you don't.

1005
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,656
No, I do.

1006
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,458
No, you don't have a pen.

1007
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,993
All right, Catherine,
I absolutely do have a pen.

1008
00:55:28,995 --> 00:55:30,795
Oh, my god.

1009
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:32,464
Turn around.

1010
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:34,733
- What?
- Turn around.

1011
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,601
Green house.

1012
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,443
You're still angry.

1013
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:47,878
No, I'm not...
Honestly.

1014
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,546
No, I can tell.

1015
00:55:49,548 --> 00:55:54,785
The corners of your
mouth are all pinched.

1016
00:55:54,787 --> 00:55:57,154
Well, are you my favorite
person in the world?

1017
00:55:57,156 --> 00:55:58,956
No.

1018
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,690
But you know, I get it.

1019
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,558
I get you,
and that's it.

1020
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,726
That's a bit severe, isn't it?

1021
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:04,961
Which part?

1022
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:06,529
Well, that you get me.

1023
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:08,398
It's like you got the final
word on me somehow?

1024
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,166
Well, I'm not qualified
to make a judgment?

1025
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,001
Well yeah, but you haven't
seen me in ten years.

1026
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:13,669
Exactly.

1027
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:15,104
I rest my case.

1028
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,572
So much for small talk.

1029
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,808
That's right.

1030
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,578
Okay, look, I've had
some problems

1031
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,047
with immigration recently.

1032
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,150
The only way I'm gonna be able
to stay in the country

1033
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:30,086
is if I can prove
that I'm worth something

1034
00:56:30,088 --> 00:56:33,122
to someone who's
a citizen here.

1035
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:35,024
Yeah, bureaucratic
bullshit.

1036
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:36,192
I see.

1037
00:56:36,194 --> 00:56:38,461
Combined with all my
fucking mistakes.

1038
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,062
So, what do you
need, money?

1039
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,899
No.

1040
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:44,600
I need you.

1041
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,469
I need you and Arianwen
to both need me.

1042
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,603
What does that mean?

1043
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,906
If I can prove
to the authorities

1044
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:54,443
that by deporting me they are
going to cause you and Arianwen,

1045
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:55,644
and this is their words,

1046
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:57,946
"extreme hardship,"

1047
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:00,015
then they'll let
me stay.

1048
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,883
Lachlan, you've been here
ten minutes,

1049
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,019
you haven't even
asked how she's doing?

1050
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,720
Well, of
course I'm interested.

1051
00:57:08,624 --> 00:57:11,726
Sorry... How's she doin'?

1052
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:16,565
She's a great kid.

1053
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,000
I'd like to see her.

1054
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,803
Come on.

1055
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,138
Just a meeting.

1056
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,240
You, me, Arianwen.

1057
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,108
We'll have a coffee, take it
from there.

1058
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,210
I know you haven't
had it easy.

1059
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,877
Neither of us have.

1060
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,913
But for you to come here
and ask me...

1061
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:34,548
Look, Catherine, look,
you know, it ain't easy.

1062
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,117
And it ain't easy sitting
here asking you for this.

1063
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,719
Ari's gonna come
home soon...

1064
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,087
Good.

1065
00:57:41,523 --> 00:57:43,557
I don't think she's
ready for this.

1066
00:57:53,567 --> 00:57:56,669
I was
a selfish prick back then.

1067
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:58,538
But I was also a fuck load
of a good time.

1068
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,774
And she knew, she knew
she was signing on for a party.

1069
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:04,611
She fucking knew
that, man.

1070
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:09,015
No way was she
signing on for a husband.

1071
00:58:09,017 --> 00:58:12,085
A fucking father...
Jesus Chri...

1072
00:58:12,087 --> 00:58:13,887
Mmm.

1073
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:15,121
I hate
talking about this.

1074
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:22,695
Where on
Earth did you get that?

1075
00:58:22,697 --> 00:58:24,030
I know where you
got that.

1076
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:25,932
That's Paul's, isn't it?

1077
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:27,934
Well, I stole
it out of his crate.

1078
00:58:27,936 --> 00:58:29,802
This is an original...
You know, you missed that.

1079
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,274
So that...

1080
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:37,010
Is that you around
the time you married her?

1081
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:43,116
And that's Jed?

1082
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:45,251
Aye.

1083
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:50,689
She should have known you
were a dead-ender.

1084
00:58:50,691 --> 00:58:52,691
I can tell.

1085
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:59,664
What happened?

1086
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,632
Well, don't you know how
to use Wikipedia?

1087
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:11,909
It's cool.

1088
00:59:12,778 --> 00:59:14,712
Crazy, crazy
time, you know?

1089
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:16,080
Especially after that
India tour.

1090
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:17,615
That's when
it all kicked off.

1091
00:59:18,718 --> 00:59:20,351
Sorry... It's Paul.

1092
00:59:20,353 --> 00:59:22,086
Hmm.

1093
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:24,055
He's just...

1094
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:27,658
been texting me nonstop.

1095
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,994
Hmm?

1096
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:31,629
You know
what tonight is?

1097
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:33,297
No.

1098
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,366
It's that
Brit Pop thing.

1099
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:37,602
He's begging us to come.

1100
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:39,203
- He knows I'm here?
- Yeah.

1101
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:41,172
That's why he's
hounding me.

1102
00:59:41,174 --> 00:59:44,609
He wants you to come.

1103
00:59:44,611 --> 00:59:45,776
All right...

1104
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:49,747
And, uh, he wants
his Cranks record back.

1105
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,048
Okay.

1106
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,749
I can just say
we're not gonna go.

1107
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:54,884
No, wait, wait, wait, no.

1108
00:59:54,886 --> 00:59:57,387
Let's go.

1109
00:59:57,389 --> 00:59:58,722
Seriously?

1110
00:59:58,724 --> 00:59:59,889
Fuck it, why not?

1111
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:01,324
I could use
the distraction.

1112
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:33,222
Hey, Beau.

1113
01:00:47,037 --> 01:00:48,737
Gimme that motherfucker!

1114
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:52,841
Hey, man!

1115
01:00:52,843 --> 01:00:54,043
How you been, man?

1116
01:00:54,045 --> 01:00:55,777
So glad you made it!

1117
01:00:55,779 --> 01:00:58,012
Yo, this is Lachlan
from The Cranks!

1118
01:00:58,014 --> 01:00:59,180
Oh, shit!

1119
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:03,351
They brought
my record back.

1120
01:01:03,353 --> 01:01:04,419
Hey, you guys want
a drink?

1121
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:06,454
Yeah, I'd love
a drink.

1122
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:25,131
Yeah, hello?

1123
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:27,166
Lachlan.

1124
01:02:27,168 --> 01:02:28,868
Catherine.

1125
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,970
I'm only doing
this because Ari's therapist

1126
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:33,205
thinks it'll be good
for her, so...

1127
01:02:35,242 --> 01:02:36,876
Okay.

1128
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:37,943
Okay, what?

1129
01:02:37,945 --> 01:02:39,912
A meeting: one cup
of coffee.

1130
01:02:39,914 --> 01:02:41,447
No promises beyond that.

1131
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:44,250
Right, of course...
of course not.

1132
01:02:44,252 --> 01:02:46,519
Two Figs at uh, 12:00?

1133
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:47,887
I'll be there.

1134
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,054
Don't be late.

1135
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,489
No, I won't be...

1136
01:02:57,531 --> 01:03:00,031
Fuck me.

1137
01:03:18,184 --> 01:03:20,919
Oh, man.

1138
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:36,934
Beau?

1139
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:48,345
Beau?

1140
01:03:48,347 --> 01:03:50,247
Beau, I- I'm
sorry, babe, I have to go.

1141
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:52,015
You don't have
any aspirin, do you?

1142
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:55,419
Yeah, just give me
one second.

1143
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:21,043
- Hey.
- Hey.

1144
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:24,947
You were a piece
of work last night.

1145
01:04:24,949 --> 01:04:26,883
Yeah?

1146
01:04:26,885 --> 01:04:31,387
I remember nothing
after a certain point.

1147
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:34,323
My head seems to remember
fucking everything.

1148
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:39,262
Thanks.

1149
01:04:52,608 --> 01:04:58,213
My ex-wife
wants to meet me after all.

1150
01:04:58,215 --> 01:04:59,514
That's good news, right?

1151
01:04:59,516 --> 01:05:02,349
Well, she's bringing
my daughter with her.

1152
01:05:02,351 --> 01:05:04,018
Good.

1153
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,491
He's actually really nice.

1154
01:05:10,493 --> 01:05:14,161
He's funny...
He's really funny.

1155
01:05:14,163 --> 01:05:15,529
Oh, he's right here.

1156
01:05:20,635 --> 01:05:21,969
Is that really you?

1157
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:23,404
Hey.

1158
01:05:36,084 --> 01:05:37,318
What did you
do last night?

1159
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,220
Oh, it was a, it was
like an event,

1160
01:05:40,222 --> 01:05:42,356
like a tribute.

1161
01:05:42,358 --> 01:05:44,325
Yeah, live it up
while you can.

1162
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:46,994
Where was it at?

1163
01:05:46,996 --> 01:05:48,629
You know, I've
got absolutely no idea,

1164
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:51,031
but it was
a wonderful night.

1165
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,266
A large coffee, please.

1166
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:53,567
Yeah, me
too, thank you.

1167
01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:55,436
And could you
get me a mimosa?

1168
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:57,171
Cheers.

1169
01:06:05,312 --> 01:06:07,347
So...

1170
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:11,317
It's really good to see
you again, Arianwen.

1171
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:13,353
Do you remember me?

1172
01:06:13,355 --> 01:06:17,457
I- I've seen some
photos of you and mom together.

1173
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:19,192
Arianwen.

1174
01:06:19,194 --> 01:06:21,660
Oh, wee Arianwen.

1175
01:06:21,662 --> 01:06:23,729
Lachlan,
you know, it's Ari.

1176
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:25,097
What?

1177
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:26,331
Her name.

1178
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:28,200
Mom, it's cool.

1179
01:06:28,202 --> 01:06:30,102
No it's not,
it's your name.

1180
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:31,236
What's Ari?

1181
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:32,537
Her name... It's Ari.

1182
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:34,573
Well, that's
what everyone calls me.

1183
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:36,775
Arianwen's too
complicated.

1184
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:39,244
Nothing wrong
with being complicated.

1185
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,612
Well, no one can
pronounce it.

1186
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:42,180
Well, it's, you can, you
pronounce it exactly

1187
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:43,382
the way you spell it.

1188
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:45,050
No one can
spell it either.

1189
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:47,552
Fuck, it's
a beautiful name.

1190
01:06:47,554 --> 01:06:49,688
A beautiful name and she
thought so too

1191
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,157
when we chose it.

1192
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,592
Hey, thank you.

1193
01:06:59,132 --> 01:07:00,499
Thank you.

1194
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:05,803
So you're
at high school.

1195
01:07:05,805 --> 01:07:07,538
Yes, ninth grade.

1196
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,106
Ninth grade.

1197
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,808
What's that, then?

1198
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,711
I think that's roughly the
time I dropped out, in fact.

1199
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:15,179
Yeah.

1200
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:18,449
I didn't-I didn't actually
drop out.

1201
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,418
What I mean is that...

1202
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:25,423
I left one day and I
didn't go back.

1203
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:26,490
Why?

1204
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:27,658
To meet my brother,
you see.

1205
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,427
We went to
Manchester, in England.

1206
01:07:29,429 --> 01:07:33,097
We went for the weekend,
end up staying seven years.

1207
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:34,365
What happened?

1208
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:36,233
Everything happened.

1209
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:40,104
The music scene was
buzzing and bunch of parties,

1210
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:41,806
lots of drugs,
lots of drinking.

1211
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,241
Let's just
talk about now.

1212
01:07:44,243 --> 01:07:47,745
Let's just keep it
to the present, you know?

1213
01:07:47,747 --> 01:07:49,146
Yeah.

1214
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,847
Now.

1215
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:55,085
I got this
form from my lawyer.

1216
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:57,587
And it's a list of reasons
why a person can claim

1217
01:07:57,589 --> 01:08:00,690
extreme hardship
from a relative, you know.

1218
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:02,692
Lines one,
two, three, and four.

1219
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:10,632
You have a major medical
condition, e. g., brain tumor,

1220
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:12,634
multiple sclerosis,
cerebral palsy,

1221
01:08:12,636 --> 01:08:15,838
for which you need your
spouse to help take care of you.

1222
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,774
You're caring for an
elderly, chronically disabled...

1223
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:20,175
- That's hilarious.
- What is this?

1224
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:21,343
No, forget it,
forget it.

1225
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:23,112
Skip down to levels
two and three.

1226
01:08:23,114 --> 01:08:26,115
Much more reasonable
reasons, I guess.

1227
01:08:26,117 --> 01:08:28,150
Uh-uh.

1228
01:08:28,152 --> 01:08:29,585
I can't perjure myself...

1229
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:31,854
No, I don't want you
to lie, Catherine...

1230
01:08:31,856 --> 01:08:33,455
...and I certainly won't
let Ari.

1231
01:08:33,457 --> 01:08:35,657
Well, I don't want you
to make her feel uncomfortable.

1232
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:37,593
We can find language that
works for us, you know?

1233
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:38,827
Look at you.

1234
01:08:38,829 --> 01:08:41,130
No, I won't re... I won't
create a history

1235
01:08:41,132 --> 01:08:42,631
that didn't happen.

1236
01:08:45,602 --> 01:08:47,769
We aren't creating
anything, it's just a form.

1237
01:08:47,771 --> 01:08:49,538
It's nothing.

1238
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,241
could you speak
to your mother, please?

1239
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:54,543
Oh, you're
not serious, are you?

1240
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:56,211
- Come on.
- Lachlan, don't.

1241
01:09:00,517 --> 01:09:01,817
Fuck it.

1242
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:05,254
Fuck it... Thank you very
much, once again.

1243
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:06,355
You're gonna leave?

1244
01:09:06,357 --> 01:09:07,422
I knew this
was never gonna work.

1245
01:09:07,424 --> 01:09:09,357
Sit down.

1246
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,560
Come on.

1247
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:15,429
Arianwen...

1248
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:17,431
it was really
lovely to see you again.

1249
01:09:17,433 --> 01:09:18,698
Just finish your coffee.

1250
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,568
Really lovely.

1251
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:23,503
Lachlan, sit down,
you're being ridiculous.

1252
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:25,505
Later.

1253
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:42,322
Okay, Warren, look, if
you're pissed about yesterday,

1254
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:43,957
I'd like to apologize.

1255
01:09:43,959 --> 01:09:47,427
Yeah, it's uh, this
new girlfriend in LA?

1256
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:49,529
No, see now that's
not where I was going.

1257
01:09:49,531 --> 01:09:51,665
Lachlan, the first half of
you job on Saturdays

1258
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:54,201
is to get
up and load the truck.

1259
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:56,536
The second half of your
job is to sell the produce.

1260
01:09:56,538 --> 01:09:59,839
The third half of your job
is to bring the shit home

1261
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:02,642
and restock it.

1262
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:05,745
This new deal where
you stay in LA every weekend

1263
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,447
and make my son do
your work,

1264
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:09,349
it is not acceptable.

1265
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:10,916
I know, you're right.

1266
01:10:12,786 --> 01:10:14,587
This came for you.

1267
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:16,722
It's from immigration.

1268
01:10:19,826 --> 01:10:21,827
I hope your shit's
in order, man.

1269
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:13,710
This will be the last edition
of "Flame-Outs", my friends.

1270
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:16,647
Looks like I'm gonna have
to take my show on the road.

1271
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,915
But, as promised,

1272
01:11:18,917 --> 01:11:21,351
I've saved the best for last.

1273
01:11:21,353 --> 01:11:23,687
And what could be
better than the western world's

1274
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:29,693
original tragic musician,
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

1275
01:11:29,695 --> 01:11:37,501
Hey, what does a rocker
like me know about Mozart?

1276
01:11:37,503 --> 01:11:41,405
than the Stones
and the Sex Pistols, eh?

1277
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,509
Listen to this.

1278
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:52,482
The man had more talent in
his little pinky

1279
01:11:52,484 --> 01:11:55,419
than most of us
have in our entire body.

1280
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:58,955
He worked to his very last
on this one

1281
01:11:58,957 --> 01:12:01,625
in order to
finish it before he died.

1282
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:04,828
Sadly, he didn't make it.

1283
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,565
And not only did he
come up short on his Requiem,

1284
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:10,567
but his wife, Constanze,

1285
01:12:10,569 --> 01:12:12,769
she spent her husband's
dying days hustling

1286
01:12:12,771 --> 01:12:14,970
to try and get payment
from the Count

1287
01:12:14,972 --> 01:12:17,005
who commissioned the
Requiem in the first place.

1288
01:12:19,508 --> 01:12:23,445
Unfinished business.

1289
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:25,814
I played this,
and it's for you.

1290
01:12:44,867 --> 01:12:47,469
Yes, Lachlan
here for Mister Piper.

1291
01:12:52,742 --> 01:12:54,476
Yes, it's Lachlan.

1292
01:12:54,478 --> 01:12:58,680
Listen uh, I've been thinking
about what you were saying.

1293
01:12:58,682 --> 01:13:01,082
It's really
time for me to go back.

1294
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:04,419
No, no, that's-that's
just not gonna work out.

1295
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,154
I want to go home.

1296
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:08,757
I need to go home.

1297
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:02,508
Hi, this is Beau's phone.

1298
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,610
Leave a message.
Hey, Beau, it's Lachlan.

1299
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:05,912
How you doin'?

1300
01:14:05,914 --> 01:14:09,048
No, I just wanted to
thank you for, oh,

1301
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:11,751
that lovely hospitality you
gave me over the weekend.

1302
01:14:11,753 --> 01:14:14,187
That was really,
really nice.

1303
01:14:14,189 --> 01:14:16,789
And you know, maybe, maybe
a voicemail

1304
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,590
isn't the right
way to say this,

1305
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:23,929
but I really wanted to be that
lad in your bed last night.

1306
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:31,770
Fuck off.

1307
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:33,171
Not Paul.

1308
01:14:33,173 --> 01:14:34,773
He's-he's not the man
for you.

1309
01:14:34,775 --> 01:14:36,575
I mean, I'm
not even saying that I am.

1310
01:14:36,577 --> 01:14:38,477
It's just that he's fucking
definitely not.

1311
01:15:06,138 --> 01:15:07,739
Another wee one,
Brian.

1312
01:15:07,741 --> 01:15:11,543
No, I think you're
good, Lachlan.

1313
01:15:11,545 --> 01:15:13,677
Good, man, I'm
always good.

1314
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,881
Another wee one.

1315
01:15:16,883 --> 01:15:19,116
What's the matter
with you, man?

1316
01:15:19,118 --> 01:15:21,050
I've got money, I've
got money.

1317
01:15:21,052 --> 01:15:23,720
My money's as good as
anybody's in that fucking bar.

1318
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:33,096
How about if I
pour you?

1319
01:15:33,098 --> 01:15:35,665
How about if I pour
you, eh?

1320
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:37,133
That's right.

1321
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:38,868
Warren.

1322
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:40,703
Hey, tucked the kids up
in bed, have you?

1323
01:15:40,705 --> 01:15:41,971
Yeah, hours ago.

1324
01:15:41,973 --> 01:15:44,173
Hey. nice...
Nice, lovely.

1325
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:46,309
So I'm here to drive
you home, my man.

1326
01:15:46,311 --> 01:15:47,877
I'm going fucking nowhere.

1327
01:15:47,879 --> 01:15:50,013
I'm listening
to music, come on.

1328
01:15:50,015 --> 01:15:51,180
I'm gonna listen
to some music.

1329
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:53,016
John Lennon.

1330
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:55,184
I love John Lennon.

1331
01:15:55,186 --> 01:15:57,220
What'd you go and die for,
that bastard shot you.

1332
01:15:57,222 --> 01:15:58,922
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

1333
01:15:58,924 --> 01:16:02,325
- Janis Joplin!
- What happened?

1334
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:04,727
- Cut em off.
The Doors, Jim Morrison!

1335
01:16:04,729 --> 01:16:05,929
Tell you what, I'm not
gonna be running out

1336
01:16:05,931 --> 01:16:07,797
of subject matter, am I?

1337
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:14,337
What else?

1338
01:16:14,339 --> 01:16:16,172
What else is on here?

1339
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:19,008
Hey, let's take a,
let's take a load off.

1340
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,010
Hey... Who the fuck says!

1341
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:22,210
Come on, man, don't...

1342
01:16:22,212 --> 01:16:23,712
Flash of
temper there, Warren?

1343
01:16:23,714 --> 01:16:26,014
I got out of bed in the
middle of the night

1344
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:27,215
to come get you, so
let's just go.

1345
01:16:27,217 --> 01:16:29,318
Oh, away from your perfect
wee farmhouse, eh?

1346
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,986
Your perfect wee kids all
dressed up

1347
01:16:30,988 --> 01:16:32,988
as cherries and bananas.

1348
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:37,859
Don't talk bad about
my family.

1349
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:40,762
You talk about my family?

1350
01:16:40,764 --> 01:16:44,198
You want to talk about
my family?

1351
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,267
Do you know who's
not in this jukebox?

1352
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:49,070
Do you know who's
not in this jukebox?

1353
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,805
My brother, Jed.

1354
01:16:50,807 --> 01:16:52,173
And do you know why?

1355
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:53,274
Do you know why?

1356
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:55,710
I know fucking why!

1357
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:57,712
Because he died!

1358
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,213
He died before he got a
chance to be in

1359
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:02,383
a fucking American jukebox!

1360
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:08,322
And it's my fault... I fucking
killed him.

1361
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:12,627
I can't go home.

1362
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,391
I can't go home.

1363
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:17,064
It's just a
black night, man.

1364
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:19,233
It'll-it'll feel
different in the morning.

1365
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,904
You ready to go now?

1366
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:29,209
No, I'll fucking
go myself.

1367
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,844
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1368
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,781
All right, now I'm
not asking!

1369
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:35,915
And I'm not telling.

1370
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,083
You really want to find
out what happens

1371
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,218
if you get a second DUl?

1372
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,886
Yeah, no, actually that
would be...

1373
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,221
You're not driving.

1374
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,822
Give me the fucking keys

1375
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,924
You're not going
to do it.

1376
01:19:10,175 --> 01:19:11,976
Ready?

1377
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:18,149
Thanks for coming to
collect me, Beau.

1378
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:19,517
You didn't have
to do this.

1379
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:22,220
I know.

1380
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:23,888
Thanks, anyway.

1381
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,289
Well I was your one
phone call.

1382
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:26,290
Your two phone calls.

1383
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:27,858
I was wasted.

1384
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,359
I'm really sorry.

1385
01:19:31,462 --> 01:19:33,230
You need to get
your shit together.

1386
01:19:46,309 --> 01:19:48,010
Hey, Beau.

1387
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,377
Oh, hi.

1388
01:20:56,379 --> 01:20:58,613
Sorry.
That's all right.

1389
01:20:58,615 --> 01:21:01,082
You're lost in
music, eh?

1390
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:07,621
Hey, thanks for
meeting me.

1391
01:21:07,623 --> 01:21:10,390
I like coming down here.

1392
01:21:10,392 --> 01:21:14,528
The buses are a pain in
the butt, though.

1393
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:16,330
How'd you get my number?

1394
01:21:16,332 --> 01:21:18,465
Snuck it off my mom's
phone last night.

1395
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,200
Excellent.

1396
01:21:20,202 --> 01:21:22,536
And what did Catherine have
to say about that?

1397
01:21:22,538 --> 01:21:24,071
Nothing.

1398
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:25,873
She's at work.

1399
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:30,143
I had to sneak out of
school, though.

1400
01:21:30,145 --> 01:21:33,446
All that stuff I was talking
about stopping off school,

1401
01:21:33,448 --> 01:21:35,081
I mean, I don't want you
to think I was endorsing that

1402
01:21:35,083 --> 01:21:36,148
in any way.

1403
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:37,617
Oh, yeah, I know.

1404
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:40,386
I'm like first in my
class in grades.

1405
01:21:40,388 --> 01:21:44,423
Well, that's good.

1406
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:47,894
That's really good.

1407
01:21:47,896 --> 01:21:51,530
I was shite in school.

1408
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:54,333
Never stuck in, never
applied myself, you know?

1409
01:21:56,603 --> 01:21:58,304
Are you
playing somewhere today?

1410
01:21:58,306 --> 01:22:01,440
No, I don't, I don't
play anymore.

1411
01:22:01,442 --> 01:22:03,910
Oh.

1412
01:22:03,912 --> 01:22:06,512
So, where do you work?

1413
01:22:06,514 --> 01:22:09,081
On a farm.

1414
01:22:09,083 --> 01:22:11,183
That's weird.

1415
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:12,218
Really?

1416
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,654
No, no, it's
cool, it's cool.

1417
01:22:17,457 --> 01:22:19,191
What are you
listening to?

1418
01:22:19,193 --> 01:22:20,159
Oh, do you want
to listen?

1419
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:21,594
Yeah.

1420
01:22:28,635 --> 01:22:31,938
Hey, you
have good taste.

1421
01:22:37,976 --> 01:22:41,578
So, how long have
you worked there?

1422
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,483
Oh, at the farm, four
years now.

1423
01:22:46,485 --> 01:22:50,654
And before that you
lived in LA?

1424
01:22:55,193 --> 01:22:58,362
How come you never
came to see us?

1425
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:05,169
What did your mother
tell you?

1426
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:10,341
That she told you to
leave us alone.

1427
01:23:10,343 --> 01:23:12,476
So, I did.

1428
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:18,215
I guess...

1429
01:23:18,217 --> 01:23:20,718
if it were me...

1430
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,420
at least I would
have tried.

1431
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:28,025
You know?

1432
01:23:28,027 --> 01:23:31,195
Yeah.

1433
01:23:31,197 --> 01:23:33,464
You're right.

1434
01:23:36,467 --> 01:23:38,334
All right.

1435
01:23:38,336 --> 01:23:41,604
Arianwen...

1436
01:23:41,606 --> 01:23:43,406
would you like
to run an errand with me?

1437
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:49,645
Hello?

1438
01:23:49,647 --> 01:23:50,713
How ya doin', my friend?

1439
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:52,048
I don't know if you
remember me,

1440
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,116
I was here
a few weeks back?

1441
01:23:53,118 --> 01:23:54,584
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I remember.

1442
01:23:54,586 --> 01:23:57,320
Glad you came back.

1443
01:23:57,322 --> 01:23:59,489
My partner nearly tore me
a new one

1444
01:23:59,491 --> 01:24:01,524
when he
heard you'd come by.

1445
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:04,793
Apparently he was a fan
of the Jam.

1446
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:06,762
Well, I have to say that it's
finally time for me

1447
01:24:06,764 --> 01:24:10,532
and the old battle
axe to go our separate ways.

1448
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:12,467
All right.

1449
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:15,070
Let's take a look.

1450
01:24:15,072 --> 01:24:18,140
Is this a real Les Paul?

1451
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:19,574
You recognize it?

1452
01:24:19,576 --> 01:24:22,077
I play in a band.

1453
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:23,178
Guitar?

1454
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:28,417
I have a Gibson too, but
it's just a regular one.

1455
01:24:28,419 --> 01:24:30,152
That's unbelievable.

1456
01:24:30,154 --> 01:24:32,487
It's not as bad as
I thought it would be.

1457
01:24:32,489 --> 01:24:35,524
Let me see what I
can get for you.

1458
01:24:35,526 --> 01:24:36,791
You're selling it?

1459
01:24:36,793 --> 01:24:39,727
- Yeah.
- Why?

1460
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:42,596
I don't have
any money, sweetheart.

1461
01:24:42,598 --> 01:24:44,265
I need some.

1462
01:24:44,267 --> 01:24:46,801
You know, I bet my partner's
gonna keep this one for himself.

1463
01:24:46,803 --> 01:24:49,804
Yeah, well I hope he takes
better care of it than I did.

1464
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:51,338
So...

1465
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,074
This is good.

1466
01:24:53,076 --> 01:24:54,475
Yeah.

1467
01:24:54,477 --> 01:24:56,310
Um...

1468
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:59,513
I've got to get back before
my afternoon class starts.

1469
01:24:59,515 --> 01:25:01,182
My bus picks
me up over there.

1470
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:02,583
I'll walk with you.

1471
01:25:02,585 --> 01:25:03,851
Okay.

1472
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:05,853
Any plans for the summer?

1473
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:08,189
Not yet.

1474
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:12,460
I may get a job at a coffee
shop where my friend works.

1475
01:25:12,462 --> 01:25:14,395
Well...

1476
01:25:14,397 --> 01:25:17,331
how do you fancy visiting
me in Scotland?

1477
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,333
Are you kidding?

1478
01:25:19,335 --> 01:25:22,570
No, I have to go back,
unfortunately.

1479
01:25:22,572 --> 01:25:24,505
But hey, look...

1480
01:25:24,507 --> 01:25:27,208
I'd really like give
you something before I go.

1481
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:28,409
Oh, wait a minute...

1482
01:25:28,411 --> 01:25:32,146
Now look, all you have to
do is promise

1483
01:25:32,148 --> 01:25:36,282
that you'll buy a
plane ticket with that.

1484
01:25:36,284 --> 01:25:38,118
I need to talk to my
mom about that first.

1485
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,652
No, I'll call
her, I'll convince her.

1486
01:25:40,654 --> 01:25:42,821
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

1487
01:25:42,823 --> 01:25:44,790
It'll be okay.

1488
01:25:46,526 --> 01:25:48,760
You're going back
to Scotland?

1489
01:25:48,762 --> 01:25:51,663
Afraid so.

1490
01:25:51,665 --> 01:25:54,867
Because I'll do that
extreme hardship thing

1491
01:25:54,869 --> 01:25:58,537
with the government
if you want.

1492
01:25:58,539 --> 01:25:59,838
I don't mind.

1493
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,274
Oh.

1494
01:26:02,276 --> 01:26:03,909
No.

1495
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:06,612
Just promise me instead...

1496
01:26:06,614 --> 01:26:11,416
you'll come visit me.

1497
01:26:11,418 --> 01:26:14,786
I promise.

1498
01:26:14,788 --> 01:26:17,756
And hey, let's
get a cab instead.

1499
01:26:17,758 --> 01:26:18,624
Forget the bus.

1500
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:20,259
Okay.

1501
01:26:24,664 --> 01:26:26,331
Here you are, bro.

1502
01:26:29,369 --> 01:26:31,570
I do remember you.

1503
01:26:31,572 --> 01:26:33,205
You do?

1504
01:26:33,207 --> 01:26:35,474
My first memory.

1505
01:26:35,476 --> 01:26:37,309
You accidentally slammed
the car door on my hand

1506
01:26:37,311 --> 01:26:40,678
when I was three.

1507
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,648
I had to go to the
hospital and get stitches.

1508
01:26:51,557 --> 01:26:55,593
I'm so sorry, Arianwen.

1509
01:26:55,595 --> 01:26:57,595
It's okay.

1510
01:26:57,597 --> 01:27:00,264
It's something
to remember you by.

1511
01:27:00,266 --> 01:27:03,733
I guess.

1512
01:27:03,735 --> 01:27:06,970
Yeah, I'm gonna
see you soon.

1513
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,940
Go on in.

1514
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,447
See you now.

1515
01:28:04,995 --> 01:28:06,028
Hey, Catherine.

1516
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,730
I hope you're happy.

1517
01:28:07,732 --> 01:28:09,932
Yeah, perfectly...
Why do you ask?

1518
01:28:09,934 --> 01:28:12,768
She's 14 and you
hand her 600 bucks?

1519
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:15,638
Yeah, well, tell you what,

1520
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,973
why don't you
come visit me too?

1521
01:28:17,975 --> 01:28:19,875
So you're going back?

1522
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:21,443
Yeah.

1523
01:28:23,546 --> 01:28:26,282
Ari's therapist still thinks
it's a good idea

1524
01:28:26,284 --> 01:28:27,950
that she get to know
her biological father.

1525
01:28:27,952 --> 01:28:30,286
She's... she's obviously
an excellent therapist,

1526
01:28:30,288 --> 01:28:31,853
I would say.

1527
01:28:38,327 --> 01:28:40,295
Catherine, you still there?

1528
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:44,064
One week.

1529
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:46,833
Thank you.

1530
01:28:46,835 --> 01:28:49,403
I want photos of
where you're living.

1531
01:28:49,405 --> 01:28:52,839
I'm gonna email you a list
of rules that we follow.

1532
01:28:52,841 --> 01:28:54,775
I know
she'll stick to them.

1533
01:28:54,777 --> 01:28:56,009
Yes, dear.

1534
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:59,713
It's you I'm not
so sure about.

1535
01:28:59,715 --> 01:29:02,349
<i>And just remember
one thing.</i>

1536
01:29:02,351 --> 01:29:05,719
<i>She's 14.</i>

1537
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:08,388
Catherine...

1538
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,725
I'll be a good dad.

1539
01:29:11,727 --> 01:29:14,628
<i>How about you?</i>

1540
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:17,698
<i>You doin' okay?</i>
