Uh-oh.

21
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,871
What is it?

22
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:10,337
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

23
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:15,864
Just pass me. Pass me.

24
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:24,520
- Is it a cop?
- I can't see.

25
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:30,464
- What the fuck are they playin' at?
- They ain't playin'. You better believe it.

26
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:44,855
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

27
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,572
OK. Hold on, you guys.

28
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:06,442
There's a truck too.

29
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:24,901
Shit. It is a cop.

30
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,864
You better stop.

31
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:33,348
OK. Sit tight, you guys.
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

32
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,728
All right? We'll be all right. Just relax.

33
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:17,669
Y'all think you can drive
any speed you want around here?

34
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:19,859
You had us scared to death, man.

35
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:24,343
- Don't you call me "man", Jew-boy.
- No, sir. What should I call you?

36
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:29,036
You don't call me nothin',
nigger-lovin' Jew-boy. You just listen.

37
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,269
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,900
Hell, you even startin' to smell
like a nigger, Jew-boy.

39
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:41,759
- Take it easy. We'll be all right.
- Sure you will, nigger-Iover.

40
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:46,139
He's seen your face. That ain't good.
You don't want him seein' your face.

41
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:49,789
Oh, it don't make no difference no more.

42
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:57,819
Whoa, shit! We into it now, boys.

43
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:01,156
You only left me a nigger,
but at least I shot me a nigger.

44
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,953
Yes, indeed.

45
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:32,963
# Now listen,
you communists and niggers and Jews

46
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,674
# Tell all your buddies to spread the news

47
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,220
# Your Day of Judgment will soon be nigh

48
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:42,140
# As the Lord in his wisdom
looks down from on high

49
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,894
# Will his battle be lost
by mixin' the races?

50
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:50,274
# We want beautiful babies,
not ones with brown faces

51
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,090
# Never, never, never, I say

52
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:55,280
# For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay

53
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:57,470
# Never, never, never, I say

54
00:08:57,574 --> 00:09:00,807
# Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay

55
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:04,144
These Ku Kluxers are better
with lynchings than with lyrics.

56
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:09,046
Just read the file, Mr Anderson.
I can do without the cabaret.

57
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,278
- You don't like me much, do you, boss?
- Sure I like you.

58
00:09:12,591 --> 00:09:15,928
I just don't share your sense of humour.

59
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:18,536
Sometimes that's all you got left.

60
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,768
- How long you been in the Bureau?
- Three years.

61
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,836
- Right outta college, huh?
- No. From the Justice Department.

62
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:29,277
Kennedy boy. Now I see.

63
00:09:30,007 --> 00:09:33,136
No. I don't think you do see.

64
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's get this thing straight.

65
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:39,393
I haven't had a pimple in years.
I shave every morning.

66
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:43,668
I even go to the bathroom by myself.
So you can quit this "boss" stuff.

67
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,840
I'm in charge because
I've been through this before.

68
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:52,845
- Birmingham? Montgomery?
- Oxford. I was with Meredith at Old Miss.

69
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,913
Oh. You got hit in the head with a brick,
so they gave you a promotion.

70
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,103
No. Shot in the shoulder.

71
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:06,402
- Well, at least you lived. That's important.
- Meredith lived. That's what's important.

72
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,561
What's got four eyes and can't see?

73
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,377
- What?
- Mississippi.

74
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,861
# Never, never, never, I say

75
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:28,198
# Cos the Ku Klux Klan is here to...

76
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:03,968
- Big building for a small town.
- Yeah.

77
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,016
Howdy.

78
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,265
Good morning. My name's Alan Ward.

79
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,498
I'm with the FBI.

80
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,626
Federal Bureau of Integration?

81
00:11:55,068 --> 00:12:00,386
- In that get-up, you ain't undercover.
- We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey.

82
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,202
Sheriff's right busy now.

83
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,686
You'll have to wait
or come back some other time.

84
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,066
We'll wait.

85
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:27,292
Listen to me,
you backwoods shit-ass, you.

86
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:32,402
You got two seconds to get the sheriff out
here or I'll kick the goddamn door in. OK?

87
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,284
Well, hell.
Looks like we got some company.

88
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,579
Some Hoover boys come down to visit.

89
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,769
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

90
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,793
- I'm Sheriff Stuckey.
- Rupert Anderson.

91
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,817
Rupert, we've been expectin' you.

92
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:54,197
- I assume you met my deputy, Mr Pell.
- Sure did.

93
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:57,534
You down here to help us
solve our nigger problems?

94
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,872
No. It's just a missing-person case.

95
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:03,062
Well, come on.

96
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,816
- You gonna want your boy in on this?
- Sheriff...

97
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,987
I'm Special Agent Ward
and I'm in charge of this case.

98
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,263
We think it might be a little
more serious than missing persons.

99
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:18,287
I don't think so, boy.
Know what I think it is?

100
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:22,459
It's a publicity stunt cooked up
by that Martin Luther King fella.

101
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:25,274
Come on.

102
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:42,168
At around 3pm, Deputy Pell says
he arrested the three boys for speeding.

103
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:46,027
He held them in jail until 10pm
and then released them.

104
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:50,198
They drove off. He says he followed them
as far as the county line...

105
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:52,388
...and never saw them again.

106
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,664
Why didn't they make a phone call?

107
00:13:56,768 --> 00:14:00,731
- Why should they?
- These boys were trained activists.

108
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:05,528
They're taught to check in every hour and,
if arrested, the moment they're released.

109
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:11,368
The hotel is near the jail. They could've
phoned from the lobby. It doesn't follow.

110
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,975
- Maybe they had a beer.
- Not these boys.

111
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,355
The civil rights office in Rossville started
making calls when they didn't check in.

112
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,735
The sheriff's office here said
they had no idea where the boys were.

113
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:25,655
First lie.

114
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,661
By who?
Sheriff's office or civil rights office?

115
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,955
Who would you believe?

116
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:37,440
Mr Ward, I was a sheriff in a little
Mississippi town just like this.

117
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,090
- Yes, I'm aware of that.
- Well, lyin' just don't come into it.

118
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:45,052
We were ten miles from Memphis,
a million miles from the rest of the worid.

119
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:50,475
If a sheriff in a town like this says that's
what happened, that's what happened.

120
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,561
Let's go eat.

121
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:09,977
We're full up, honey.
Y'all wanna wait a while?

122
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:13,001
- Is the wait worth it?
- We're not full for nothin', sugar.

123
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:15,504
Y'all wanna look at a menu
while you wait?

124
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:17,381
Thank you.

125
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:20,822
Well, what y'all gonna do? Wait or leave?

126
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:23,534
We're gonna wait
cos we wanna be near you.

127
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:28,748
- There are some empty seats down there.
- Uh, Mr Ward...

128
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,981
That's coloured down there.
Don't even think about it.

129
00:15:32,085 --> 00:15:37,195
- People here are gettin' ready to leave.
- Aren't you hungry, Mr Anderson?

130
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:48,145
Good afternoon. Looks good.

131
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:02,432
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

132
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,726
I'm looking for some information.

133
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:11,400
- I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.
- Just a few questions.

134
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:18,805
I ain't got nothin' to say to you, sir.

135
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:43,520
The civil rights boys came to propose
setting up a voter registration clinic.

136
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,066
Before the locals got a chance to say yes,
the Klan burned 'em down.

137
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,342
- You give a man a vote but he can't use it.
- Yeah, that's the way it works.

138
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:53,532
What did their office in Rossville say?

139
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:57,494
That the boys came back here
to apologise to the congregation.

140
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,414
"Sorry you folks didn't get to vote."

141
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,169
"I suppose most of you
never knew you even had one."

142
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,776
"Now you got no place to go on Sunday."

143
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:12,720
Apparently, after they came back here,
they talked to some locals down the road.

144
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,100
- I think that's where we should start.
- Oh, they won't talk to you.

145
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,480
These people have to live here
long after we're gone.

146
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,400
They'd rather bite their tongue off
than talk to us.

147
00:17:24,504 --> 00:17:26,694
Bureau procedure, Mr Anderson.

148
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:38,061
The church caught fire
and you ran home. Is that correct?

149
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,147
Yes, sir.

150
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,859
And then the four white men
stopped you?

151
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,423
Yes, sir.

152
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:48,073
And these four white men
attacked your husband?

153
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:50,471
Yes, sir.

154
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:53,078
But you can't identify them.

155
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,041
No, sir.

156
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:59,753
Did you report this to the police?

157
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:02,360
No, sir.

158
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,176
But you told the civil rights boys
what happened?

159
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,678
Yes, sir.

160
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:11,433
Ma'am, did they tell you
where they were going after that?

161
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:18,420
- No, sir.
- Nothing?

162
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,505
No, sir.

163
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:24,885
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

164
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,971
You're welcome.

165
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:42,405
- Come on, boy.
- Open up.

166
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,994
- Your brother Hollis here, Fennis?
- Yes, sir.

167
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,601
Well, wake his ass up. We wanna see him.

168
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,582
- Why?
- Just wake him up, boy.

169
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,294
- What is it?
- There you are, nigger trash!

170
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,987
Come here, boy!

171
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,342
Hollis! Hollis!

172
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:04,409
Get your ass back here,
you fuckin' nigger!

173
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:06,391
Hollis! Hollis!

174
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,954
We better not catch you talkin' to the FBI.

175
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:27,457
Or you'll be dead, boy. Real dead.

176
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,356
You admire these kids, don't you?

177
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:51,964
Don't you?

178
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,154
I think they're bein' used.

179
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:58,638
They're sent here in their
Volkswagens and sneakers...

180
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:00,828
...just to get their heads cracked open.

181
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:04,686
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
they believed in what they were doing?

182
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,753
- Did it occur to them they'd end up dead?
- Maybe.

183
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:12,403
In Washington they sure as hell knew,
didn't they?

184
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:15,219
Some things are worth dying for.

185
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:20,642
Well, down here
they see things a little differently.

186
00:20:21,998 --> 00:20:25,752
People down here feel
some things are worth killin' for.

187
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:32,322
Where does it come from, all this hatred?

188
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:38,058
You know, when I was a little boy...

189
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:42,438
...there was an old Negro farmer lived
down the road from us, name of Monroe.

190
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:47,756
And he was... Well, I guess he was just
a little luckier than my daddy was.

191
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,535
He bought himself a mule.

192
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,227
That was a big deal around that town.

193
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:02,043
My daddy hated that mule.

194
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:07,675
His friends kidded him that they saw
Monroe ploughin' with his new mule...

195
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,367
...and Monroe was gonna rent
another field now that he had a mule.

196
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:17,164
One morning that mule
just showed up dead.

197
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:22,066
They poisoned the water.

198
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:28,114
After that there was never any mention
about that mule around my daddy.

199
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:36,249
One time we were drivin' past
Monroe's place and we saw it was empty.

200
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:40,524
He'd just packed up and left, I guess.
Gone up North or somethin'.

201
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:45,634
I looked over at my daddy's face...

202
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,119
...and I knew he'd done it.

203
00:21:50,223 --> 00:21:52,204
And he saw that I knew.

204
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,394
He was ashamed.

205
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,523
<i>I guess he was ashamed.</i>

206
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:02,633
He looked at me and he said...

207
00:22:02,737 --> 00:22:06,908
<i>..."If you ain't better than a nigger,
son, who are you better than?"</i>

208
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,080
Do you think that's an excuse?

209
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:14,938
No, it's not an excuse.
It's just a story about my daddy.

210
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,134
Where does that leave you?

211
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,324
With an old man who was so full of hate...

212
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:29,121
...that he didn't know that
bein' poor was what was killin' him.

213
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,654
Get the light! Get the light!

214
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:43,930
You all right?

215
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,340
I guess they know we're here.

216
00:23:32,631 --> 00:23:35,029
Now you know what you're gettin' into.

217
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:38,262
I'm gonna call Washington.
I need more agents.

218
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:42,121
Would it change your mind if I say
that's exactly the wrong thing to do?

219
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:43,581
No.

220
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:36,349
The whole place for 75 a month.
It's private. It's central. It's perfect.

221
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,686
There's room for a hundred more agents.

222
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,606
Two hundred, maybe.
More in the balcony.

223
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,943
We're just trying to find the three boys,
Mr Anderson.

224
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:48,342
I'll take all the help I can get.

225
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,618
When's the show start?

226
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,079
- Who's the big shot?
- It's the Klan.

227
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:54,667
No pointy hats but plenty of pointy heads.

228
00:25:55,606 --> 00:25:57,900
Let me run a check on the plates.

229
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,063
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

230
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:34,504
Anderson.
Say hello to our mayor, Mr Tilman here.

231
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,841
- How do you do, Anderson?
- Mr Mayor. Mr Barber.

232
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:44,411
Well, this looks like the place to be.
Even for me.

233
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:49,208
Yep. Nothin' like a barbershop
for jawin' your socks off.

234
00:26:49,938 --> 00:26:51,920
Where you from, Anderson?

235
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,465
Thornton, Mississippi, sir.
Just a spit from Tennessee.

236
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:59,220
Well, then you must know
how we all feel down here.

237
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:02,974
We don't take to outsiders
tellin' us how to live our lives.

238
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:05,685
And I'm here to tell ya,
our nigras were happy...

239
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,648
...till those beatnik college kids
came down here stirrin' things up.

240
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,985
Before that, there wasn't
anybody complainin'.

241
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,697
Nobody dared.

242
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,660
We got a real peaceful
community down here, Anderson.

243
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:24,457
Course, they're just like any other folks,
I reckon, when you push 'em too far.

244
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:29,462
The way I figure it,
it's like three sticks of old dynamite.

245
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:34,260
You shake it up... and we're gonna
be scrapin' bodies off the street.

246
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:39,682
I'm just here to investigate the missing
three kids, ask some questions.

247
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,977
If this all boiled down to gravy...

248
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:45,209
...there wouldn't be enough
to cover a chicken-fried steak.

249
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:52,405
Them kids you're lookin' for? I'd bet you a
shiny new dime they're in Chicago now...

250
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:57,828
...drinkin' a cold beer and havin' a laugh
about the commotion they stirred up here.

251
00:27:57,932 --> 00:27:59,809
Well, I sure hope so.

252
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:04,502
You can tell your bosses people got
the wrong idea about the South.

253
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:07,631
You know what I'm talkin' about.

254
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:11,281
Everybody runnin' around ragged,
backwards and illiterate...

255
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:15,244
...eatin' sowbelly and corn pone
three times a day.

256
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:19,519
Simple fact is, Anderson,
we got two cultures down here.

257
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:23,482
White culture and a coloured culture.

258
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:27,966
That's the way it always has been.
That's the way it always will be.

259
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:32,659
- The rest of America don't see it that way.
- The rest of America don't mean jack shit.

260
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:35,058
You in Mississippi now.

261
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:37,769
Oh, that's for sure!

262
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:43,922
- What's the score, Mr Barber?
- St Louis on top, five to nothing.

263
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,633
- What inning is it?
- Bottom of the seventh.

264
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:50,179
- You like baseball, Anderson?
- Yeah, I do. You know...

265
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:56,853
...it's the only time when a black man
can wave a stick at a white man...

266
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,669
...and not start a riot.

267
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,502
Sir.

268
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:21,048
We checked on the plate, sir.
Clayton Townley.

269
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:25,219
Townley. Grand Wizard of
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

270
00:29:25,323 --> 00:29:28,139
That's him. And we have a lead on the car.

271
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:31,997
A Choctaw on the reservation
thinks he knows where it is.

272
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:33,353
Good.

273
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,020
You have an appointment next Tuesday?

274
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,210
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

275
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:23,723
Afternoon, ladies.

276
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:26,539
- Can I help you?
- Well, yes, you can.

277
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:30,501
I tell you, I just...
I hate the way I look. You know?

278
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:34,256
What do you think? A permanent wave,
maybe? Or a bleach job?

279
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:40,096
- That looks good. Was it done in here?
- No. Jackson.

280
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,727
A wig's your only hope, hon. You won't
be able to do much with that cue ball.

281
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,150
If you wanna ask us some questions,
this is where you'll hear it all.

282
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:53,444
Yeah, matter of fact, I do.

283
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:57,928
I was wonderin' who that gentleman was
that just drove in over there.

284
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:02,308
- I know that isn't President Johnson.
- His name's Townley. Clayton Townley.

285
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:06,167
- Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

286
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:11,381
Well, I think it's a shame if those two kids
are dead. But I sure hope you find 'em.

287
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:15,761
Thank you. Actually, three kids are
missin'. There's a coloured kid also.

288
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:20,663
Do you think your people'd be down here
if it weren't for those two white boys?

289
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,853
- Maybe not, miss.
- Mrs.

290
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:26,398
Pell. Her old man's Ray Stuckey's deputy.

291
00:31:29,631 --> 00:31:31,612
But I'm single.

292
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,095
Move out of the way.

293
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:59,769
Move over, boy.
We'll take care of this. It's a local problem.

294
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:02,898
We'll handle this.
We don't need your damn help.

295
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:09,885
It ain't right havin' blood on Main Street.
How'd that look on the TV news?

296
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:14,161
- Get up.
- OK, I got him. I got him.

297
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,105
He's the kid from the diner.

298
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:23,546
Think twice before you talk to
coloured kids with an audience.

299
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:27,092
They're sending a message from
the boss in Tupelo, and you know it.

300
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,116
I know it, yes. Clayton Townley,
chief pointy head.

301
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:33,454
Yeah, that's right. How did you know?

302
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:35,852
Bureau procedure, Mr Ward.
Try it sometime.

303
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:37,625
We did.

304
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:40,232
We found the car the kids were driving.

305
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,676
Good morning.

306
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:33,418
Good morning.

307
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,680
Two beer cans, a Coca-Cola bottle,
a green plastic bottle...

308
00:34:57,784 --> 00:35:03,311
...a badly burned wristwatch stopped
at 12.45, and a set of keys. No bodies.

309
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:07,796
- I want the area searched. Every inch.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,611
- It's a big swamp.
- Every inch, Mr Bird.

311
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:17,286
I guess they never left Mississippi.

312
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:21,144
They're dead. They're dead.

313
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:24,168
Mr Bird?

314
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:28,027
- Yes, sir?
- There's a telephone at the truck stop.

315
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:32,615
Get to it, get on it, and get me
a hundred more men here by morning.

316
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:35,223
- A hundred?
- A hundred.

317
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,768
- Bureau people, sir?
- I don't care if it's the army!

318
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:42,105
- I want this entire swamp searched!
- Yes, sir.

319
00:35:45,234 --> 00:35:47,528
Don't do it, Mr Ward.

320
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:51,491
- You'll just start a war.
- It was a war long before we got here.

321
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:52,394
Get the fuck outta here now!

322
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:35,150
Sir?

323
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:40,782
The sheriff's alibi is solid. He was playing
poker with his wife's brother and cousins.

324
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:44,849
- The whole time?
- For three hours. He lost $11.38.

325
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:51,210
There's something else. We're having
a little trouble with the motel manager.

326
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:55,799
- What kind of trouble?
- He wants us out. We're bad for business.

327
00:37:55,903 --> 00:37:57,885
Buy it.

328
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:00,492
- Sorry, sir?
- Buy it!

329
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:03,516
The motel.

330
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,227
- How high can I go?
- Whatever it takes.

331
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:32,507
Today in Jessup County, Mississippi...

332
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:36,157
...amidst the violence of this week,
the eyes of the nation...

333
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:40,224
...are fixed on the search
for the missing civil rights workers.

334
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:45,439
I think it's all a big hoax. But if they
are in that swamp, then they asked for it.

335
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:51,591
Naval reserves have joined FBI
agents in searching for the missing men.

336
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:56,284
I think they planned it. They're sittin' up in
New York laughin' at us Mississippi folks.

337
00:38:56,389 --> 00:39:01,499
- You think it's a hoax?
- A big hoax. They gonna find nothin'.

338
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:05,983
Civil rights leaders are optimistic
as to the young men's whereabouts.

339
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:10,676
But privately there is mounting concern
that they will ever be found alive.

340
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,491
They came lookin' for trouble
and found it.

341
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:17,976
This is Marek Baribobi, Network News,
Jessup County, Mississippi.

342
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:24,858
Tell you what I think they oughta be doin'.
Lookin' up in Canada for them boys...

343
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,570
...instead of our swamps around here.

344
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:33,201
I'll tell you somethin' else. I think it's
a stunt dreamed up by NAAC people.

345
00:39:33,306 --> 00:39:36,226
- NAAC people?
- NAACP.

346
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,335
Know what it stands for? Niggers,
Alligators, Apes, Coons and Possums.

347
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,151
Tell you what you got.
You got your NAACP.

348
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:48,010
You got your SNCC. You got your COFO.

349
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:52,703
You know what all that mess is?
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T.

350
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,893
You got it?

351
00:39:58,543 --> 00:40:04,070
One day we won't have to say
"Good morning, sir, Mr Sheriff."

352
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:08,450
Maybe there'll come a time when
we won't have to say "Mr Stuckey".

353
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:13,038
One day there'll come a time when
we'll just say "Stuckey" or "Sheriff".

354
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:17,731
And one day there'll come a time when
the sheriff won't even be a white man.

355
00:40:29,202 --> 00:40:30,975
Hello.

356
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:37,024
I wonder if I could ask you
a few questions.

357
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:41,612
I don't suppose you could tell me
what kind of flower these are, could you?

358
00:40:41,717 --> 00:40:44,741
I been seein' 'em
all over the place here and...

359
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:48,599
Never saw such a darn pretty plant.

360
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,519
They're trumpet-pitchers.

361
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:53,605
Trumpet-pitchers?

362
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,421
They're beautiful. They really are.

363
00:40:56,734 --> 00:41:00,071
They don't smell so good
but they're pretty.

364
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:06,432
It's nice talkin' to you.

365
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:11,542
Sorry about interruptin' your meeting
but we can't get anybody to talk to us.

366
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:13,732
They zip up, like my momma used to say.

367
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:18,738
People don't wanna talk to you because
they're afraid it'll get back to the law.

368
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,554
<i>- We are the law.
- Not around here you ain't.</i>

369
00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:28,645
We came to find out what happened to
those boys. They were here to help you.

370
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:33,546
- It ain't coloured folks you should talk to.
- Who should we talk to?

371
00:41:34,381 --> 00:41:36,466
Come on, Aaron.

372
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:40,533
You should start with the sheriff's office.

373
00:41:41,993 --> 00:41:44,913
<i>- Why aren't you afraid?
- How come you ain't?</i>

374
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:46,791
Aaron?

375
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,545
Aaron, come on, son.

376
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:08,273
<i>Here's the pitch. Swing and a line-drive
base hit. Another run is home.</i>

377
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:15,260
<i>On to the next pitch by the ruffled
Bob Gibson. He is upset.</i>

378
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:18,285
<i>Ron Hunt singled to centre.
Hickman passed third...</i>

379
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,579
<i>... and scored the Mets' second run.</i>

380
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:23,290
<i>Hunt holds on at first,
and the Mets lead two to one.</i>

381
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:40,080
Good evening, Mrs Pell. I'm Agent Ward.
This is Agent Anderson.

382
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:42,479
We're with the FBI.

383
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,669
Is your husband home?

384
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,172
We'd like to have a word with him.

385
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,987
Y'all come in, then.

386
00:42:56,453 --> 00:43:00,937
It's the FBI gentlemen, Clinton. They
wanna ask you some more questions.

387
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:03,336
You want me to put
your dinner in the oven?

388
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:08,550
Leave us alone.

389
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,740
Mind if I take a seat?

390
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:17,727
What's so goddamn important
you got to bother me at home?

391
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:22,629
I just wanted to run through once again
your movements on June 21st.

392
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,923
June which?

393
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,113
June 21st.

394
00:43:27,217 --> 00:43:32,223
Deputy, we both know what day we're
talking about, so let's do this civilised.

395
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:36,707
Then you get back to your ball game
and we can get back to Washington.

396
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,743
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

397
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:56,104
It's just when you've heard a question
a dozen times, it gets kinda boring.

398
00:43:56,626 --> 00:43:58,920
Yeah, I guess so.

399
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:08,618
- You don't eat together?
- He works funny hours.

400
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,728
- You think that's odd?
- No.

401
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:16,231
No, I work funny hours myself.

402
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:22,280
I eat when I'm hungry.
He eats when he can.

403
00:44:22,384 --> 00:44:25,930
- Can I get you somethin'?
- No, no. Thanks.

404
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:28,015
This is a nice house.

405
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,352
- How long have you lived here?
- I was born here.

406
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:35,107
But my father lost the house
in a poker game a long time ago.

407
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:40,008
We've been payin' rent ever since.

408
00:44:42,824 --> 00:44:45,535
It's a wicked game.

409
00:44:48,038 --> 00:44:49,811
Poker.

410
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,939
Wicked.

411
00:44:53,044 --> 00:44:55,025
Mr Anderson?

412
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,448
It's nice talkin' to you. Guess I gotta go.

413
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:07,539
Them pork chops still any good, honey?
Bring me a beer.

414
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:09,938
Good night.

415
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:12,545
Let you get back to your baseball.

416
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:16,299
They say it's the only game
where a black man can wave a stick...

417
00:45:16,404 --> 00:45:18,489
I know. I already heard that one.

418
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:27,771
Fifty minutes of his alibi
hinges on his wife.

419
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:31,108
- You talked to her. What's she like?
- She's a nice lady.

420
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:34,862
Tell me, Mr Anderson.
How does a woman like that end up with...

421
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:38,825
With shithead in there? You know
what these small towns are like.

422
00:45:38,929 --> 00:45:43,413
A girl spends all her time in high school
lookin' for the guy she's gonna marry...

423
00:45:43,518 --> 00:45:46,021
...and spends the rest
of her life wonderin' why.

424
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,732
Something's wrong. He's too confident.

425
00:45:48,836 --> 00:45:51,652
- Did you see the wedding photograph?
- No.

426
00:45:51,756 --> 00:45:55,719
His three pals, the ushers,
had their thumbs hooked in their belts...

427
00:45:55,823 --> 00:45:58,535
...with their three fingers pointing down.

428
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,246
So what is that?
Some sort of Masonic thing?

429
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:04,271
No! KKK.

430
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:12,822
I know you ain't drunk.

431
00:46:12,926 --> 00:46:16,055
- I'm not drunk.
- All right. You ain't drunk.

432
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,600
I'm just gonna take you
where you can sleep it off.

433
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:21,790
All right. Hold up.

434
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,900
Watch your head.

435
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,030
Hi. Uh... There was a couple of things
I needed to check with you.

436
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:30,931
- My husband's not here.
- Actually, it was you I wanted to talk to.

437
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,956
Me?

438
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,563
OK. You'd better come in, then.

439
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:42,507
Just take a minute.

440
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:45,740
My boss, he's kind of a pain.
A college kid.

441
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:49,703
He has to dot all the i's
and cross all the t's.

442
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:55,230
- What is it you wanted to ask me about?
- It's a time thing we're not so clear about.

443
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:58,358
Should I put your flowers
in some water while you're here?

444
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,548
Yeah. Actually they're for you.

445
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,198
They're beautiful.

446
00:48:04,303 --> 00:48:06,388
They are pretty, aren't they?

447
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:09,413
They don't smell so nice
but they're pretty.

448
00:48:09,934 --> 00:48:12,437
Can I get you anything? Some tea?

449
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,627
Yeah. Thanks.

450
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,981
Oh, don't you look at that.
It's a terrible photo.

451
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:35,588
Oh, I don't know about that.

452
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:39,864
- Is this recent?
- No. I wish.

453
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:42,575
Well... this here looks recent to me.

454
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,287
We were married 14 years ago.

455
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:48,311
Are you kidding me? No! Come on.

456
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,961
- You take sugar?
- Sure do.

457
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:57,905
- You know, I grew up in a town like this.
- You were smart enough to leave.

458
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,887
Why didn't you?

459
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:02,077
"For better or for worse."

460
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:08,647
How about you? Are you married?

461
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:13,027
Well, I was, as I remember.

462
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:16,781
It didn't last very long. I was never home.

463
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:23,559
I guess she got fed up with... phone calls
from Miami, postcards from Des Moines.

464
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,897
There was always a guy around.

465
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:30,651
Any guy that could spare the time
for a movie or a beer...

466
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:33,675
...or a quarter for the jukebox.

467
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:38,681
She left.

468
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:46,189
- How about you?
- Well, you know the South, Mr Anderson.

469
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:51,299
You leave high school and marry
the first boy who makes you laugh.

470
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:53,802
Hey, your husband's quite a guy.

471
00:49:56,201 --> 00:50:01,623
You know, my boss has this thing
about an hour - 50 minutes, to be exact -

472
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:05,273
...that your husband says
that he was with you.

473
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:12,469
- And I guess he was.
- Guess he was.

474
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:18,518
Well, that's a pity.

475
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,149
That means that I don't have an excuse
for hangin' around here any more.

476
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,486
Well...

477
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,406
Thank you for the iced tea.

478
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,013
- Thank you for the flowers.
- Sure.

479
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,706
Do you know what kind they are?

480
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:43,129
- I heard they're called trumpet-pitchers.
- Oh, that's right.

481
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,883
My daddy used to call 'em
ladies-from-hell because they're carn...

482
00:50:46,988 --> 00:50:48,760
Carnivorous.

483
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:50,846
- That's the word?
- Yeah.

484
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,852
That pretty colour's the bait. Insects just
home in there and wham, they're dead...

485
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:58,772
...even before they got their shoes off.

486
00:51:02,213 --> 00:51:04,507
Maybe I should've picked something else.

487
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:06,489
Maybe.

488
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:22,236
<i># Sing the wondrous love of Jesus</i>

489
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:29,849

00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:26,893

00:53:35,929 --> 00:53:40,727
You already been told once, nigger.
We don't wanna have to tell you again.

506
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:45,002
You make any more trouble by flappin'
them boot-lips off to them federal men...

507
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:50,321
...we'll sure as hell put you in the ground,
boy, and that's without a pine box!

508
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:53,971
You understand me?

509
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:08,884
How are Negroes treated in Mississippi?

510
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:13,264
They're treated about fair.
About as good as they oughta be.

511
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:23,796
The niggers around here have been
treated awful bad for a long time.

512
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:37,145
I think Martin Luther King's
one of the leaders.

513
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:40,273
I mean, J Edgar Hoover said
that he was a communist...

514
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,985
...and they had proof to that effect.

515
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:47,782
But I don't know that for sure. I hadn't
seen it myself, but that's what they say.

516
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,425
Hey, you really wanna find that nigger?

517
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:08,952
They say we've got to eat together and
use the same bathroom as the niggers.

518
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:12,393
And that's awful hard
for some Mississippi folks to do.

519
00:55:12,497 --> 00:55:18,337
They're not like us. They don't take baths.
They stink, they... they're nasty...

520
00:55:18,963 --> 00:55:21,049
...they're just not like white folks.

521
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:29,392
What do you think has happened
to the three boys?

522
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,582
Dead.

523
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,606
Just as dead as they can be.

524
00:55:35,023 --> 00:55:37,109
It feels so good.

525
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:42,114
- Is she asleep? Is she?
- Yeah.

526
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:46,599
Oh, my Lord. I'm sorry I woke you up.

527
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:52,960
- Bye, hon. I'll be a couple of hours.
- All right.

528
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:55,984
Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid?

529
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:59,739
Yeah.
She's growin' up real quick, ain't she?

530
00:56:09,229 --> 00:56:11,731
Tuesday'll be just fine on those, Mary.

531
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:19,031
Funny.

532
00:56:21,117 --> 00:56:23,203
Their kids are so cute.

533
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:31,963
Is that thing back on me again?

534
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:35,613
If the entire Secret Service
couldn't protect the president...

535
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:39,054
...how in hell are we supposed
to protect a few nigras?

536
00:56:39,158 --> 00:56:44,790
It ain't nothin' but a bunch of lowlife white
trash drinkin' too much cheap alcohol.

537
00:56:44,894 --> 00:56:49,795
More like paint thinner and snake juice,
because this state's as dry as a martini...

538
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,298
...and we got the alcoholics to prove it.

539
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:56,678
Give me a little room here.
Excuse me, Bob.

540
00:56:59,077 --> 00:57:01,475
- Is this OK?
- Your name, please?

541
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,291
Clayton Townley. Local businessman.

542
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:08,671
Are you, sir, a spokesman for
the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan?

543
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:11,800
I told you. I'm a businessman.

544
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:15,450
I'm also a Mississippian.
And an American.

545
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:18,787
And I am sick and tired
of the way many of us Mississippians...

546
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:22,437
...are havin' our views distorted
by your newspapers and on TV.

547
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,627
So let's get this straight.

548
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:28,485
We do not accept Jews
because they reject Christ.

549
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,908
Their control of the international banking
cartels are at the root of communism.

550
00:57:34,012 --> 00:57:37,558
We do not accept Papists
because they bow to a Roman dictator.

551
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:41,729
We do not accept Turks, Mongols,
Tartars, Orientals nor Negroes...

552
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:45,171
...because we're here to protect
Anglo-Saxon democracy...

553
00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:48,925
...and the American way.
- Thank you, sir.

554
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:55,287
Lefty, you are livin' proof
that cousins shouldn't fuck.

555
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:01,544
What I was tryin' to say...
there's this coloured boy.

556
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:05,298
He wants to play football
for Bear Bryant over at Alabama.

557
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,531
So Bear says
"I'm gonna give you a tryout."

558
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:10,929
What's he gonna run with? A watermelon?

559
00:58:12,285 --> 00:58:14,684
He's gonna keep on runnin' too.

560
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:17,916
"OK, boy" he says.
"You get down there on one goal line."

561
00:58:18,021 --> 00:58:22,922
He puts a whole team on the other goal
line. He throws the boy the ball and says...

562
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:32,099
- Are you open?
- You got to be a member to drink here.

563
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:35,228
A member?

564
00:58:35,332 --> 00:58:37,418
A member of what?

565
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:42,423
A member of the social club.

566
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:46,073
I thought you'd just buy me a beer.

567
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:49,202
Give him a beer, Frank.

568
00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:55,772
Nice to be back in a dry county again.

569
00:58:55,876 --> 00:58:58,900
When I was sheriff,
half of my take-home pay...

570
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:02,238
...was from collectin' taxes
on illegal jukes like this.

571
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:04,115
Probably works the same here.

572
00:59:04,323 --> 00:59:08,286
I would think you'd haul in a tidy penny
here, winkin' at the bootleggers.

573
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:10,580
I wouldn't know nothin' about that.

574
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:14,022
Yeah... A tidy penny.

575
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:20,800
- Got anything stronger than this, Deputy?
- No. No, we ain't.

576
00:59:21,218 --> 00:59:22,782
Oh?

577
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:28,413
You know, in Thornton, Mississippi,
there's a joy-juice still in every yard.

578
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:32,689
All you need is just some corn
and sugar and a pot to boil it in.

579
00:59:34,149 --> 00:59:36,756
I was tryin' to fingerprint
this old boy once.

580
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,467
He'd had his hand
in the mash barrel all his life.

581
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:42,700
There was no skin at all on there.
No prints.

582
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:46,246
We ain't interested in your
good ol' Mississippi boy stories.

583
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,540
You ain't from here no more.

584
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:55,006
- Why'd you leave, anyway?
- I just wanted a change of scenery.

585
00:59:57,717 --> 01:00:00,950
The grits started leavin'
a bad taste in my mouth.

586
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:04,183
Well, if that's how you feel about it,
Mr FBI Man...

587
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:10,232
...why don't you get back to your commie,
nigger-lovin' bosses up North?

588
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,943
You must not know my boss - Mr Hoover.

589
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:16,697
He's not too fond of commies.
He'd be on your side there.

590
01:00:16,801 --> 01:00:20,764
I don't give two shits whose side
your Mr Hoover's on, boy.

591
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:26,083
All I know is we got 5,000 niggers in this
county who ain't registered to vote yet.

592
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:29,003
And, as far as I'm concerned,
they never will.

593
01:00:29,003 --> 01:00:35,051
So tell your stiff suits up in Washington,
DC, they ain't gonna change us one bit.

594
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:39,953
Unless it's over my dead body.
Or a lot of dead niggers.

595
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:47,044
You'd kill, Frank?
Is that what you're sayin'?

596
01:00:47,357 --> 01:00:51,633
I wouldn't give it no more thought
than wringin' a cat's neck.

597
01:00:51,737 --> 01:00:55,387
And there ain't a court in Mississippi
that'd convict me for it.

598
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:57,577
How about you, Deputy?

599
01:00:57,577 --> 01:01:01,748
- How are you with wringin' necks, huh?
- Just keep pushin' me, Hoover boy.

600
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:04,251
You get this straight, you cornhole fucker.

601
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:09,570
Tell your queer-ass bosses they'll never
find them civil rightsters down here.

602
01:01:09,674 --> 01:01:13,845
So you might as well pack your bags
and head up North where you belong.

603
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,538
You get this straight, shitkicker.

604
01:01:18,643 --> 01:01:21,771
Don't you go mistakin' me
for some whole other body.

605
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:25,004
Your brain's in your dick
if you think we'll just fade away.

606
01:01:25,108 --> 01:01:28,237
We're gonna be here
till this thing's finished.

607
01:01:29,697 --> 01:01:32,512
How about you, Deputy?

608
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,641
Is that gun just for show?

609
01:01:35,745 --> 01:01:39,082
Or do you get to shoot people
once in a while?

610
01:01:46,278 --> 01:01:49,094
Thanks for the beer.

611
01:01:54,517 --> 01:02:00,982
<i>Ask them if they want to help save this
country from the onslaught of integration.</i>

612
01:02:01,087 --> 01:02:05,779
<i>You know the system: They want to throw
white children and coloured children...</i>

613
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:08,699
<i>... into the melting pot of integration...</i>

614
01:02:08,804 --> 01:02:15,165
<i>... out of which will come a conglomerated,
mulatto, mongrel class of people!</i>

615
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:18,607
<i>Both races will be destroyed
in such a movement.</i>

616
01:02:18,711 --> 01:02:23,925
<i>I, for one, under God will die
before I'll yield one inch...</i>

617
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:26,636
<i>... to that kind of a movement in America.</i>

618
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:31,121
Do you know the trouble you've caused?

619
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:35,918
They've been on the radio all day,
talkin' about FBI intimidation.

620
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:39,568
We're not thugs, Mr Anderson.
We're gonna do this thing my way.

621
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:44,469
- I know. Bureau procedure.
- Why were you at the beauty parlour?

622
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:48,328
If that was Bureau business, I wanna
know about it. If not, I won't allow it.

623
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,935
- Do you understand me?!
- Get in here!

624
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:57,088
You know your problem? You don't know
when to speak and when to shut up!

625
01:02:57,192 --> 01:02:59,799
That makes you a fool!

626
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:03,241
Mrs Pell won't say anything
her husband doesn't want her to.

627
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:05,431
And I'm not gonna choke it out of her!

628
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:09,185
This can of worms
only opens from the inside.

629
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,006
I know that.

630
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,496
Freedom! Freedom!

631
01:03:34,422 --> 01:03:36,508
White nigger!

632
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:41,513
White niggers!

633
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,145
Hurry up! Hurry up!

634
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:51,003
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

635
01:03:59,763 --> 01:04:02,266
20 cents?

636
01:04:05,603 --> 01:04:09,462
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

637
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:14,676
<i># Bring him</i>

638
01:04:15,093 --> 01:04:20,412
<i># Your burdens</i>

639
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:27,712
<i># Seek not his favour</i>

<i># Tell... tell him your sorrows</i>

641
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:45,753
- Hi.
- Hey, now!

642
01:04:46,796 --> 01:04:51,176
Just passin' by. Just sayin' hello.
You're not out watchin' the parade?

643
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,224
How come you don't ask me questions?
Everybody's been talked to 'cept me.

644
01:04:59,727 --> 01:05:03,690
Why don't you send some of them
good-Iookin' FBI boys to talk to me?

645
01:05:04,524 --> 01:05:08,174
Sorry about the intrusin.
I was at the hardware store and...

646
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:11,198
- Pecan?
- I'm sick of pecans.

647
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:14,431
Freedom! Freedom!

648
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,873
- Are you willing to stand and fight?
- Yes!

649
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:54,164
How'd you find out about this?

650
01:05:55,311 --> 01:05:57,605
Bureau procedure, Mr Ward.

651
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:11,892
Sheriff Stuckey.

652
01:06:12,414 --> 01:06:14,604
He got his phone call.

653
01:06:17,419 --> 01:06:19,922
Wonder who else was called.

654
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:23,781
Where you goin', boy?

655
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:26,388
Go on. Get outta here.

656
01:06:43,282 --> 01:06:45,368
Here they come.

657
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:57,256
- Come on. Let's go.
- We'll wait until they go back inside.

658
01:06:58,195 --> 01:07:00,281
Get him!

659
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:06,225
Get him into the goddamn truck!

660
01:07:06,642 --> 01:07:09,458
Get inside, you sons of bitches.

661
01:07:10,813 --> 01:07:13,629
- Let's go!
- Wait until they go back inside!

662
01:07:19,156 --> 01:07:21,555
Come on, Ward. Let's go. Come on!

663
01:07:22,389 --> 01:07:24,266
Go on!

664
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:33,094
- Turn left!
- How do you know?

665
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,597
I don't. Just turn left.

666
01:08:38,726 --> 01:08:41,020
There's the truck.

667
01:08:41,124 --> 01:08:43,419
Go up that little road there.

668
01:08:47,069 --> 01:08:49,363
Stop, stop.

669
01:09:23,986 --> 01:09:26,176
What's wrong with these people?

670
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:40,880
Mrs Walker, I know this is difficult
for you, but I really need your help.

671
01:09:40,984 --> 01:09:44,634
If you could just persuade
your son to press charges...

672
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:48,180
...then we could pick up
the deputy at least, right away.

673
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,787
He won't talk to no one.

674
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:54,645
- And it won't do no good anyway.
- I promise you, it will.

675
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:57,148
Leave him alone.

676
01:09:57,253 --> 01:09:59,547
<i>Maybe then they'll let us alone.</i>

677
01:10:12,061 --> 01:10:18,214
If this is a pattern, I guess at least
we know what happened on June 21st.

678
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:21,864
Pell stopped the three boys
for speeding at three o'clock.

679
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,097
He held them in jail until
the Klan could get organised.

680
01:10:25,201 --> 01:10:30,207
Then he released 'em at 10.30. By that
time, his buddies were ready and waiting.

681
01:10:30,311 --> 01:10:33,231
No. Pell went with 'em that night.
I'm sure of it.

682
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:34,795
Do you think he'll crack?

683
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,924
Down here they say
rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.

684
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:50,855
Did you release
the three civil rights workers...

685
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,609
...into the hands of the Klan
on the night of June 21st?

686
01:10:54,714 --> 01:10:55,757
No.

687
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:58,885
- Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?
- No.

688
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:03,161
- Have you ever been a member?
- No.

689
01:11:03,265 --> 01:11:06,394
Are you familiar with
the term Grand Cyclops?

690
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:08,062
I've heard of it.

691
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:12,025
Were you in fact the Grand Cyclops
of the East Mississippi Klavern...

692
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:15,571
...of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
for the past three years?

693
01:11:15,675 --> 01:11:19,846
Objection. My client's already told you,
he's not even a member of the Klan.

694
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,956
Objection? This is just an interview, sir.
There's really no need to be so formal.

695
01:11:25,165 --> 01:11:31,526
Well, if this is just an interview, I guess
I don't have to stay here. I got work to do.

696
01:11:33,612 --> 01:11:38,096
- I guess you do too, don't you?
- Yes, sir. You can be sure that we'll do it.

697
01:11:38,722 --> 01:11:40,808
Good luck.

698
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:46,543
Y'all get enough to indict me,
you know where to find me.

699
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:50,610
- How'd it go?
- Fine. Just fine.

700
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,218
Don't you worry about a goddamn thing.

701
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,242
Are you about to be indicted?

702
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:59,370
Does the FBI have evidence
against the sheriff's office?

703
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:03,333
- Are you cooperating with them?
- We're cooperatin'. We have all along.

704
01:12:03,438 --> 01:12:05,419
There's not one iota of proof.

705
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:09,486
Could you not do that, please?
Sir, do not do that, please.

706
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:14,075
You've already been told once!
Get the fuck outta here!

707
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:20,019
Do we have to tell you 2,000 times?
Go back where you belong!

708
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:23,252
Get outta my face!

709
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:26,485
Get on outta here and leave us alone!
Leave us alone!

710
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:30,552
Go on home where you belong, boy!
You're gonna get hurt!

711
01:12:33,055 --> 01:12:36,287
Mr Ward, this is gettin' to be
about as much as we can take.

712
01:12:36,392 --> 01:12:39,312
- I cannot register a stronger complaint.
- Not now, sir.

713
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:44,213
Now, just a minute. I resent your
public pursuit of my sheriff's department.

714
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:47,967
You have made every effort to
implicate them in these disappearances.

715
01:12:47,967 --> 01:12:52,869
Your slimy innuendoes are not evidence
that they were connected with any crime.

716
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:55,789
We're trying to get to the truth.
We're frustrated too.

717
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:59,230
Any jackass can point a finger,
but that ain't evidence.

718
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:03,506
Us old cotton-choppers are still
stupid enough to believe in democracy.

719
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:08,199
- We know our rights under the law!
- You know somethin', all right.

720
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:13,413
- I'd bet a cotton-choppin' dollar on that.
- You're gettin' so far up my nose...

721
01:13:13,517 --> 01:13:16,437
...I'm beginnin' to feel
your boots on my chin.

722
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:19,461
And I'm tellin' you one more time,
Mr Apple Red.

723
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:24,154
A couple of crazies in bedsheets dancin'
round the countryside scarin' Negroes...

724
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:27,179
...is not the fault of the entire
state of Mississippi!

725
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:32,914
There are three dead kids and a lot of
scared people because of your sheriff.

726
01:13:33,018 --> 01:13:38,754
- So get used to havin' us around.
- Get used to my boots on your chin too.

727
01:13:38,858 --> 01:13:40,944
And you people better back off.

728
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:46,993
Goddamn FBI. Who do they think they are,
comin' to my part of the country...

729
01:13:47,097 --> 01:13:50,538
- Do you have a statement, Mr Mayor?
- Goddamn right I have.

730
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:53,458
For a moment there, Mr Anderson...

731
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:56,587
...it sounded like we were
both on the same side.

732
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:27,038
- Are you all right, honey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

733
01:14:27,142 --> 01:14:30,375
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thanks. I will.

734
01:15:54,951 --> 01:15:56,619
Momma! Come quick!

735
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,329
There's no sign of him, sir.
He's long gone.

736
01:16:16,433 --> 01:16:20,188
His mother lives across the street.
She won't even answer the door.

737
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:23,838
I want the whole area covered.
Someone must have seen something.

738
01:16:23,942 --> 01:16:26,236
- They won't talk to us.
- Get going, Mr Bird.

739
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,052
If they won't talk to us, shake it out of 'em.

740
01:16:32,389 --> 01:16:34,892
Let's go. Every house. Come on.

741
01:16:41,983 --> 01:16:43,756
What?

742
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:49,492
All these white guys chasin' around with
their notebooks will get you nowhere.

743
01:16:49,596 --> 01:16:52,307
<i>OK. What would you do?</i>

744
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:00,024
It's OK to be afraid.

745
01:17:07,846 --> 01:17:12,017
Go on, Willie. Tell 'em what you saw.

746
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:48,726
The defendants will rise.

747
01:17:51,646 --> 01:17:54,774
In this country a man's home is his castle.

748
01:17:56,026 --> 01:18:00,614
That is one of the principles
by which this community survives.

749
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,847
You men have done violence
to that principle.

750
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:06,976
But I want you to know
that the court understands...

751
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:11,564
...that the crimes you have committed
have been, to some extent at least...

752
01:18:11,668 --> 01:18:15,423
...brought about by... outside influences.

753
01:18:24,391 --> 01:18:27,520
Outsiders have come
into Jessup County...

754
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,900
...and they've been
people of low morality...

755
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,507
...and unhygienic.

756
01:18:34,924 --> 01:18:38,261
And their presence here
has provoked a lot of people.

757
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:43,162
So the court understands...

758
01:18:43,162 --> 01:18:46,917
...without condoning them, mind you...

759
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:50,045
...that the crimes to which
you men have pled guilty...

760
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:55,677
...were, to some extent at least,
provoked by these outside influences.

761
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:02,560
So, with all this,
I'm gonna make your punishment light.

762
01:19:03,602 --> 01:19:08,191
I'm gonna sentence you each
to five years' imprisonment.

763
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:13,822
But I'm gonna suspend these sentences.

764
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:51,052
You can't go in there, sir.

765
01:19:51,156 --> 01:19:53,242
FBI. Let us through.

766
01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:55,745
I'm sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

767
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:03,253
Sheriff?

768
01:20:06,486 --> 01:20:08,885
Y'all really started somethin' this time.

769
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:11,492
Move these cars.
I wanna go in and talk to them.

770
01:20:11,596 --> 01:20:15,038
- You've gone as far as you're gonna go.
- We can handle this.

771
01:20:15,142 --> 01:20:18,062
Just some crazy coloureds
tearin' up their own assholes.

772
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:20,252
Local problem.

773
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:40,588
Look at those flames, Mr Ward. That's
why they sent you down here, wasn't it?

774
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:44,655
It would've happened anyway
and you know it.

775
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:49,452
If I was a Negro,
I'd probably think the same way they do.

776
01:20:49,973 --> 01:20:54,145
If you were a Negro,
nobody'd give a damn what you thought.

777
01:21:51,084 --> 01:21:55,673
Aaron! Take your momma, grandmomma
and the children out the back door.

778
01:21:55,673 --> 01:22:00,053
When you hit the road, keep goin'.
You understand? Keep goin', son.

779
01:22:01,721 --> 01:22:04,120
Nathan! Come on, Nathan. Get up!

780
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:07,353
Get up, Nathan, now! Come on!
Get out of the bed!

781
01:22:07,353 --> 01:22:11,941
- What's happening?
- Momma! Come on, Momma.

782
01:22:14,548 --> 01:22:16,634
Come on, y'all.

783
01:22:17,468 --> 01:22:20,180
Come on, Grandma. Let's go!

784
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:35,927
<i># All ye who labour</i>

785
01:22:36,344 --> 01:22:41,350
Who's there? If you're in there,
come on out! You hear?

786
01:22:42,184 --> 01:22:44,374
I ain't takin' this shit no more!

787
01:22:59,287 --> 01:23:07,630
<i># Bring him your burdens</i>

788
01:23:09,194 --> 01:23:15,034
<i># Seek not his favour</i>

789
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:23,898

01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:42,357

01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:47,049
<i># He satisfies</i>

793
01:23:49,344 --> 01:23:51,325
Everything's OK, Papa.

794
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:53,828
Momma and the giris are fine.

795
01:23:53,932 --> 01:23:57,374
They just cracked your head some.
You just keep on breathin'.

796
01:23:57,478 --> 01:23:59,668
Don't you go dyin' on me now.

797
01:23:59,876 --> 01:24:01,962
You hear me?

798
01:24:03,214 --> 01:24:05,195
You gonna be just fine.

799
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:37,211
You know, cows won't run away. No one
knows why. They're just stupid, I guess.

800
01:24:37,315 --> 01:24:42,946
They just stand there until
their bellies swell up and they pop.

801
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,866
They have relatives in Detroit.

802
01:24:46,596 --> 01:24:50,142
- Are they gonna go?
- I didn't give 'em any choice.

803
01:24:51,706 --> 01:24:54,835
At least we know who did this.

804
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:57,755
- We did.
- Well, don't fret. It's progress.

805
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:02,239
20 years ago they'd have
strung 'em up for stealin' a watermelon.

806
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:05,785
I don't understand you, Mr Anderson.
Not at all.

807
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,643
Let's get somethin' straight, all right?

808
01:25:09,747 --> 01:25:13,815
This thing was fucked up the moment
we turned it into a show for the newsmen.

809
01:25:13,919 --> 01:25:16,526
<i>The moment those three kids
disappeared, it was news.</i>

810
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:21,010
The moment the three civil rights
workers disappeared, it was news.

811
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:24,452
To me they're just kids.
They're still missin'.

812
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:29,145
What's missing... is the 50 minutes
Pell said he was with his wife.

813
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,089
OK.

814
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:53,652
I love Mississippi.

815
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:06,166
They...

816
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,564
They hate Mississippi.

817
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:13,153
They hate us because
we present a shining example...

818
01:26:13,257 --> 01:26:16,490
...of successful segregation.

819
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:21,183
These Northern students,
with their atheist, communist bosses...

820
01:26:21,183 --> 01:26:25,354
...that have come into our community
this summer with the wish to destroy it...

821
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:29,108
...this week have taken a terrible blow.

822
01:26:29,943 --> 01:26:33,593
This week their cause has been crippled.

823
01:26:33,697 --> 01:26:38,494
This week all of these federal policemen
you see out here pryin' into our lives...

824
01:26:38,598 --> 01:26:40,580
...violatin' our civil liberties...

825
01:26:40,684 --> 01:26:43,500
...have learned that they are
powerless against us...

826
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:49,131
...if every single Anglo-Saxon
Christian one of us stands together!

827
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:55,701
This week...

828
01:26:57,161 --> 01:26:59,560
- Ward?
- We have company, sir.

829
01:27:00,707 --> 01:27:03,105
Why are you here?
This is a political meeting.

830
01:27:03,105 --> 01:27:07,381
- Doesn't smell that way to me, Deputy.
- It's a political meeting, Hoover boy.

831
01:27:07,485 --> 01:27:13,117
Oh, it looks like a political meeting
but smells more like Klan to me...

832
01:27:13,117 --> 01:27:16,454
...with or without the Halloween costumes.

833
01:27:17,184 --> 01:27:18,957
Gentlemen.

834
01:27:18,957 --> 01:27:22,607
In the courts of Mississippi,
they have been reminded...

835
01:27:22,711 --> 01:27:25,944
...that they cannot by force
turn our communities...

836
01:27:26,048 --> 01:27:28,551
<i>...into replicas of their communities.</i>

837
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:33,140
Communities in which Negroes run riot,
unrestrained and unpunished...

838
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:37,520
...as they do this summer in the streets
of Harlem, or in the streets of Oakland...

839
01:27:37,624 --> 01:27:39,814
...or in the streets of Chicago!

840
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:03,346
Can I come in?

841
01:29:11,793 --> 01:29:13,983
It's not good for you to be here.

842
01:29:14,088 --> 01:29:16,799
- Why?
- It's ugly.

843
01:29:17,633 --> 01:29:19,928
This whole thing is so ugly.

844
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:24,725
Have you any idea what it's like
to live with all this?

845
01:29:25,663 --> 01:29:30,252
People look at us...
and only see bigots and racists.

846
01:29:32,442 --> 01:29:35,570
Hatred isn't something you're born with.

847
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:37,760
It gets taught.

848
01:29:39,533 --> 01:29:43,496
At school they said segregation
is what it said in the Bible.

849
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:48,710
Genesis 9, verse 27.

850
01:29:51,943 --> 01:29:56,844
At seven years of age, you get
told it enough times, you believe it.

851
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,016
You believe the hatred.

852
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:05,709
You live it. You breathe it.

853
01:30:07,899 --> 01:30:09,984
You marry it.

854
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:42,938
My husband drove
one of the cars that night.

855
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:46,484
- Shh.
- That's what you wanna hear, isn't it?

856
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:53,471
The bodies are buried
on the Roberts farm, in an earthen dam.

857
01:31:12,138 --> 01:31:13,807
Sir!

858
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,824
Take a break, Mr Bird.

859
01:31:28,928 --> 01:31:31,640
Put some handkerchiefs around your face.

860
01:31:44,988 --> 01:31:47,074
Bring that here.

861
01:32:01,465 --> 01:32:05,011
The bodies of the three civil rights
workers were found today...

862
01:32:05,011 --> 01:32:07,409
...at an undisclosed grave.

863
01:32:08,869 --> 01:32:13,354
Neither the FBI nor the sheriff's
department will comment on the case.

864
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:16,274
The bodies were brought
to Jessup County Hospital.

865
01:32:16,274 --> 01:32:18,777
Officials here also refused comment.

866
01:32:18,881 --> 01:32:23,261
There is speculation that an autopsy
will be performed later tonight.

867
01:32:25,346 --> 01:32:28,266
OK, keep it open. We're comin' through.

868
01:32:28,371 --> 01:32:30,978
Come on, open it up.

869
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:34,002
Hold it back.

870
01:32:53,921 --> 01:32:56,841
Clinton,
you got problems at home to tend to.

871
01:32:56,945 --> 01:32:58,405
What do you mean?

872
01:32:58,509 --> 01:33:02,159
I mean pull your head
out of your ass and get home!

873
01:33:02,263 --> 01:33:06,748
<i>"I, Vincent Thompson, am the
cheddar-cheese champion of the worid."</i>

874
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:13,422
<i>"In international competition with 42 other
entries, my cheddar won first prize...</i>

appearance and colour."</i>

876
01:33:22,182 --> 01:33:25,936
Hey, Clinton.
I didn't expect you home so early.

877
01:33:27,188 --> 01:33:29,273
Hi, Frank.

878
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:42,205
No, don't. I'm sorry.

879
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,056
Sir.

880
01:34:00,142 --> 01:34:02,227
Say again?

881
01:34:03,583 --> 01:34:05,669
I'll be right there.

882
01:34:10,466 --> 01:34:12,864
- Mr Bird.
- Yes, sir?

883
01:34:12,864 --> 01:34:14,950
Get five men and meet me outside.

884
01:34:17,349 --> 01:34:20,477
- Where's Anderson?
- He's at the motel, sir.

885
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:29,237
You two take the front door. If anyone
tries to get past you, break 'em down.

886
01:34:29,342 --> 01:34:32,262
You two take the door on the corridor.
Mr Bird?

887
01:34:34,034 --> 01:34:37,997
OK. Go get Anderson. Bring him here.

888
01:34:38,101 --> 01:34:42,899
Don't tell him why.
Don't tell him anything. Just get him here.

889
01:35:14,184 --> 01:35:16,478
Mr Anderson. Stop!

890
01:35:16,478 --> 01:35:18,147
- Mr Anderson!
- Go to hell.

891
01:35:18,251 --> 01:35:21,797
I'm telling you to stop and
I mean it. We're not killers.

892
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:25,968
<i>- It's the difference between them and us.
- No, between them and you!</i>

893
01:35:26,073 --> 01:35:28,471
- You're no more like them than I am.
- Wrong.

894
01:35:28,575 --> 01:35:32,121
What do you care what I do to a bastard
hidin' behind a sheriff's badge?

895
01:35:32,225 --> 01:35:35,354
- You have the whole worid to change!
- And I'm changin' it.

896
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:39,004
- You're as arrogant as you are stupid!
- You're changin' it too.

897
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:41,090
I'll make some changes right now!

898
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:45,574
Don't mess this up just because
you like foolin' around with witnesses.

899
01:35:55,377 --> 01:35:57,567
A gun don't mean shit unless you use it.

900
01:35:57,671 --> 01:36:01,842
- I'll kill you now if you don't listen to me.
- Fuck you.

901
01:36:01,947 --> 01:36:04,032
Let me go. Let me go.

902
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:10,707
- We'll go after all of 'em, together.
- You wouldn't know how!

903
01:36:10,811 --> 01:36:13,418
- You'll teach me.
- You don't have the guts.

904
01:36:13,522 --> 01:36:16,755
Not only do I have the guts,
I have the authority.

905
01:36:16,859 --> 01:36:18,945
What is that supposed to mean?

906
01:36:19,049 --> 01:36:24,159
New rules. We nail 'em any way we can.
Even your way.

907
01:36:24,264 --> 01:36:27,184
Is this you talkin' or
some guy pullin' your strings?

908
01:36:27,288 --> 01:36:29,269
Both.

909
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:31,459
- We do it my way.
- Your way.

910
01:36:31,564 --> 01:36:34,275
- With my people!
- Whatever it takes.

911
01:36:36,152 --> 01:36:38,029
OK.

912
01:36:44,078 --> 01:36:46,164
Gimme a minute.

913
01:36:53,881 --> 01:36:56,801
- You think he would've shot me?
- Oh, yes, sir.

914
01:36:58,052 --> 01:37:00,555
He's a ballsy little bastard, isn't he?

915
01:37:08,585 --> 01:37:11,192
They want me to say "Let us not forget...

916
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:16,302
...that two white boys also died
helping Negroes help themselves."

917
01:37:19,431 --> 01:37:24,749
They want me to say "We mourn with
the mothers of these two white boys."

918
01:37:27,982 --> 01:37:32,362
But the state of Mississippi
won't even allow these white boys...

919
01:37:32,466 --> 01:37:36,012
...to be buried in the same
cemetery as this Negro boy.

920
01:37:38,723 --> 01:37:42,999
<i>I say I have no more love to give.</i>

921
01:37:43,103 --> 01:37:46,232
<i>I have only anger in my heart today...</i>

922
01:37:46,232 --> 01:37:49,882
<i>... and I want you to be angry with me!</i>

923
01:37:49,986 --> 01:37:52,489
<i>Now, I am sick and I am tired...</i>

924
01:37:52,593 --> 01:37:55,826
<i>... and I want you to be
sick and tired with me!</i>

925
01:37:55,930 --> 01:38:00,206
<i>I... I... I am sick and tired
of going to the funerals...</i>

926
01:38:00,206 --> 01:38:03,960
<i>... of black men who have been
murdered by white men!</i>

927
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:08,132
<i>I... I am sick and tired
of the people of this country...</i>

928
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:12,199
<i>... who continue to allow
these things to happen!</i>

929
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:16,996
<i>What is an "inalienable right"
if you are a Negro?</i>

930
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:20,437
<i>What does it mean,
"equal treatment under the law"?</i>

931
01:38:20,542 --> 01:38:25,234
<i>What does it mean,
"liberty and justice for all"?</i>

932
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:28,467
<i>Now I say to these people:</i>

933
01:38:28,572 --> 01:38:34,412
<i>Look at the face of this young man
and you will see the face of a black man.</i>

934
01:38:34,516 --> 01:38:38,792
<i>But, if you look at the bloodshed, it is red.
It is like yours!</i>

935
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:41,190
<i>It is just like yours!</i>

936
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:13,170
You...

937
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:17,862
I'm gonna tell you a story.

938
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:25,058
A young kid named Homer Wilkes
lives about 30 miles north of here.

939
01:40:25,162 --> 01:40:30,690
He'd just taken his girlfriend home
and was walkin' back along the road...

940
01:40:30,794 --> 01:40:33,088
...when a car pulled up.

941
01:40:33,192 --> 01:40:36,008
Three white boys took him for a ride.

942
01:40:39,971 --> 01:40:41,639
Now...

943
01:40:42,682 --> 01:40:45,394
...he hadn't done anything...

944
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:49,252
...except...

945
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:52,277
...be a Negro.

946
01:40:54,988 --> 01:40:57,282
And they took him to a shack.

947
01:40:57,908 --> 01:41:00,619
A shack like... like this one.

948
01:41:01,558 --> 01:41:04,686
And they took out a razor blade...

949
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:08,545
...a regular old razor blade, like this one...

950
01:41:10,839 --> 01:41:13,968
...and they pulled down his pants...

951
01:41:16,784 --> 01:41:19,495
...and they spread his legs...

952
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:23,875
...and they sliced off his scrotum.

953
01:41:26,899 --> 01:41:28,985
Put it in a coffee cup.

954
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:39,831
And do you know how much you bleed
when somebody cuts off your balls?

955
01:41:39,935 --> 01:41:42,021
Huh?!

956
01:41:44,628 --> 01:41:50,363
When they found Homer, he looked like
he'd been dipped in blood up to his waist.

957
01:41:50,468 --> 01:41:53,805
He was barely alive when
they got him to the hospital.

958
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:56,516
He can hardly walk now.

959
01:42:06,528 --> 01:42:08,718
Mayor, we know you know...

960
01:42:08,822 --> 01:42:12,993
...who was there when those three
civil rights boys was murdered.

961
01:42:13,098 --> 01:42:15,600
We know you know
who pulled the trigger.

962
01:42:21,649 --> 01:42:24,152
Is there somethin' you wanna say to me?

963
01:42:30,826 --> 01:42:32,912
OK!

964
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,359
- Is he with the Bureau?
- Yeah. He's kind of a specialist.

965
01:42:41,463 --> 01:42:44,800
- You're sure the mayor won't talk?
- No, they'd kill him!

966
01:42:44,904 --> 01:42:47,616
All right. What do you have?

967
01:42:47,616 --> 01:42:51,474
There were three cars and seven men.
Pell and Bailey did the killing.

968
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:54,707
- Sheriff Stuckey?
- He was too smart to be there.

969
01:42:54,812 --> 01:42:57,419
- So Pell pulled the trigger for him.
- And Townley?

970
01:42:57,523 --> 01:43:01,486
It was his idea. Grand Dragons,
they don't get their hands dirty.

971
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:05,136
The whole thing, huh? Bullet by bullet.

972
01:43:06,596 --> 01:43:13,166
I don't suppose you're interested in words
like "coercin" or "hearsay" or "duress".

973
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:15,564
This is no good in court.

974
01:43:15,669 --> 01:43:19,527
We're not in court, Mr Ward.
We'll never get 'em on murder anyway.

975
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:23,490
That's a state charge.
These hayseeds will never prosecute.

976
01:43:23,594 --> 01:43:26,827
- I know that!
- We've got to get 'em in federal court!

977
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:30,999
- Violation of civil rights!
- Remember whose rights you're violatin'!

978
01:43:31,103 --> 01:43:34,961
- Don't put me on your perch, Mr Ward!
- Don't drag me into your gutter!

979
01:43:35,066 --> 01:43:38,090
These people crawled out of a sewer,
Mr Ward!

980
01:43:38,194 --> 01:43:40,906
And maybe the gutter's
where we should be!

981
01:43:46,641 --> 01:43:48,727
Thank you.

982
01:44:12,295 --> 01:44:14,381
This better be important.

983
01:44:22,828 --> 01:44:25,331
Who the hell called this meeting?

984
01:44:27,938 --> 01:44:31,275
<i>- We thought you did.
- Of this group? Are you stupid?</i>

985
01:44:31,797 --> 01:44:33,987
You didn't call this? Shit.

986
01:44:34,091 --> 01:44:37,324
- If you didn't call this, who the fuck did?
- Shut up.

987
01:44:37,324 --> 01:44:42,225
Is this some kind of bullshit setup?
Ray, are you sure you didn't call this?

988
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:46,605
Cos I got a note from my wife
and it said it was from you and Clinton.

989
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:49,004
Lester, shut up!

990
01:44:50,672 --> 01:44:55,052
Now,
we're all gonna walk straight outta here...

991
01:44:55,157 --> 01:44:57,242
...and say nothing.

992
01:44:57,555 --> 01:44:59,641
That means nothin', Lester.

993
01:44:59,745 --> 01:45:02,665
- First one who opens his mouth is dead.
- Shut up.

994
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:05,689
Hey, Clinton.

995
01:45:09,444 --> 01:45:10,487
Clinton.

996
01:45:14,658 --> 01:45:18,829
Looks like the rattlesnakes
are startin' to commit suicide.

997
01:45:46,256 --> 01:45:48,342
Hi, Lester.

998
01:45:53,243 --> 01:45:56,372
We'll give you that ride home.

999
01:45:56,893 --> 01:45:58,666
What?

1000
01:45:58,771 --> 01:46:02,733
Well, I know you said 4.30
but we're runnin' a little late, so...

1001
01:46:02,838 --> 01:46:05,549
- I'll meet you in the car.
- You're cracked.

1002
01:46:07,635 --> 01:46:09,720
Do you have change of a 20?

1003
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:12,849
Sure.

1004
01:46:18,063 --> 01:46:20,045
Get in the car, Lester.

1005
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:24,216
Or you'll have a hard time pickin'
your nose once I've closed this drawer.

1006
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:32,455
Lester, you could make it a lot easier on
yourself by goin' on the record right now.

1007
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:37,669
I ain't got nothin' to say.
You barkin' up the wrong tree, mister.

1008
01:46:38,712 --> 01:46:42,570
Lester, I gotta tell you somethin'.
We got you cold.

1009
01:46:42,675 --> 01:46:45,595
Your buddies have already talked.

1010
01:46:46,325 --> 01:46:48,410
You're lyin'.

1011
01:46:53,103 --> 01:46:59,152
You're in a lot of trouble. We know you
drove the second vehicle, the green truck.

1012
01:46:59,256 --> 01:47:02,906
And your buddy says...
Refresh my memory here, Mr Bird.

1013
01:47:03,010 --> 01:47:06,660
"Lester Cowens kicked the Negro
twice in the face and then shot him."

1014
01:47:06,764 --> 01:47:10,102
- That's a goddamn lie.
- No, it's true. What else, Mr Bird?

1015
01:47:10,206 --> 01:47:15,212
"Lester Cowens said 'They only left me
a nigger, but at least I shot me a nigger."'

1016
01:47:17,714 --> 01:47:21,886
- I didn't kill him. I shot him in the ass.
- We know that.

1017
01:47:22,512 --> 01:47:26,996
He was already dead by the time you shot
him. But your buddy sees it differently.

1018
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,897
<i>Your buddy tells it that you killed the kid.
You either go on the record right now...</i>

1019
01:47:32,001 --> 01:47:36,590
...or it's gonna be your ass
we're talkin' about, not just a black kid's!

1020
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:54,006
Think about it, Lester.
Come on out of there.

1021
01:47:55,883 --> 01:47:57,968
Come on out.

1022
01:48:41,247 --> 01:48:43,332
This is tricky.

1023
01:48:44,167 --> 01:48:46,878
They make it look so easy, don't they?

1024
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:51,467
I got a question for you, Clinton.

1025
01:48:52,510 --> 01:48:55,638
You don't mind if I call you Clinton,
do you?

1026
01:48:55,742 --> 01:48:58,245
I feel like I know you so well.

1027
01:49:00,644 --> 01:49:04,190
The way we have it,
on the night of the murders...

1028
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:07,944
...you made a short speech as the
bulldozer buried the kids in the dam.

1029
01:49:08,465 --> 01:49:10,342
How does Lester tell it?

1030
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:15,557
"Mississippi will be proud of you.
You've struck a blow for the white man."

1031
01:49:15,557 --> 01:49:18,789
Is that what you said, Clinton? Hm?

1032
01:49:19,207 --> 01:49:21,709
Is that what you said?

1033
01:49:21,814 --> 01:49:23,691
It must've been you...

1034
01:49:23,795 --> 01:49:28,071
...because Clayton Townley and
Ray Stuckey were too smart to be there.

1035
01:49:29,218 --> 01:49:34,015
And you was too stupid to think
anybody'd remember what you said.

1036
01:49:34,119 --> 01:49:36,414
But old Lester, he got a good memory.

1037
01:49:41,106 --> 01:49:44,756
I'm sorry.
I haven't done this for a long time.

1038
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:50,284
Did you make a speech the night that
you beat up your wife, Clinton? Huh?

1039
01:49:50,701 --> 01:49:52,891
Did ya?

1040
01:49:52,891 --> 01:49:56,124
Did you strike a blow
for the white man that night?

1041
01:50:00,608 --> 01:50:03,423
You got a stupid smile.
You know that, Pell?

1042
01:50:03,528 --> 01:50:06,656
Can you see it? Huh? Good!

1043
01:50:07,491 --> 01:50:12,183
Did you smile when the bulldozer
ran over the black kid's body? Did ya?!

1044
01:50:16,355 --> 01:50:19,901
Did you smile when the bodies
were covered over? Did ya?!

1045
01:50:20,109 --> 01:50:22,925
Get up here. Come on. Get up!

1046
01:50:23,029 --> 01:50:26,158
Did you smile that same stupid smile,
huh?!

1047
01:50:26,262 --> 01:50:28,139
Did ya?! You...

1048
01:50:33,145 --> 01:50:36,899
Did ya smile, Pell? Did ya smile?!

1049
01:50:37,003 --> 01:50:39,506
Huh?! Did ya?!

1050
01:50:44,825 --> 01:50:47,223
Make no mistake about it, Deputy.

1051
01:50:47,328 --> 01:50:53,585
I'll cut your fuckin' head off and not give
a shit how it reads in the report sheet.

1052
01:51:15,693 --> 01:51:17,779
One more bite. One more bite.

1053
01:51:18,926 --> 01:51:21,429
One more bite, darlin'. One more bite.

1054
01:51:38,427 --> 01:51:42,390
- Shit, Lester! What the fuck is goin' on?!
- Shut up!

1055
01:51:42,494 --> 01:51:46,353
Get in the bedroom and lock the door!
And stay away from the windows!

1056
01:51:57,616 --> 01:51:59,493
Shit.

1057
01:53:03,628 --> 01:53:06,235
Please. Please! I didn't say a thing!

1058
01:53:06,235 --> 01:53:10,407
I swear! It's a setup! I didn't say nothin'!
I didn't say nothin'!

1059
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:16,142
Nothin'! I didn't say nothin'!
I didn't say nothin'!

1060
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:26,049
I didn't say nothin'!

1061
01:53:46,072 --> 01:53:49,409
You're lucky we've been
watchin' your ass, Lester.

1062
01:53:51,912 --> 01:53:57,752
If you go on the record, Mr Cowens,
we'll give you protection. If not...

1063
01:53:57,752 --> 01:54:01,298
If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.

1064
01:54:01,611 --> 01:54:04,844
Oh. You need a toilet, Lester.

1065
01:54:29,976 --> 01:54:32,062
We really had him goin', huh?

1066
01:55:16,487 --> 01:55:19,095
We'll take care of the check, Mr Swilley.

1067
01:55:43,497 --> 01:55:46,522
Well, I suppose I'II... be back for supper.

1068
01:55:56,012 --> 01:55:58,514
Button up, Wesley.

1069
01:57:13,913 --> 01:57:16,311
Why did he do it?

1070
01:57:16,415 --> 01:57:20,587
He wasn't even in on it. Wasn't even Klan.

1071
01:57:21,734 --> 01:57:24,028
Mr Bird, he was guilty.

1072
01:57:24,967 --> 01:57:29,972
Anyone's guilty who watches this happen
and pretends it isn't.

1073
01:57:30,077 --> 01:57:33,310
No. He was guilty all right.

1074
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,585
Just as guilty as the fanatics
who pulled the trigger.

1075
01:57:39,671 --> 01:57:40,818
Maybe we all are.

1076
01:58:35,463 --> 01:58:37,549
Hello!

1077
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:40,678
Yeah.

1078
01:58:46,622 --> 01:58:51,211
I just missed you at the hospital.
They said you'd gone home.

1079
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:54,756
What's left of it.

1080
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:58,823
- I'm real sorry.
- So am I.

1081
01:59:00,179 --> 01:59:03,308
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1082
01:59:06,019 --> 01:59:09,460
- Where will you go?
- I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm stayin'.

1083
01:59:09,565 --> 01:59:12,172
This is my home. Born here.

1084
01:59:13,736 --> 01:59:15,822
Probably die here.

1085
01:59:19,263 --> 01:59:23,435
If I wanted to leave,
I would've done it a long time ago.

1086
01:59:23,539 --> 01:59:25,833
Things'll work out.

1087
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:30,005
There's enough good people around here
know what I did was right.

1088
01:59:30,109 --> 01:59:34,280
And enough ladies
like the way I fix their hair.

1089
01:59:49,089 --> 01:59:50,862
Hey.

1090
01:59:52,217 --> 01:59:54,824
If you're ever in Des Moines...

1091
01:59:54,929 --> 01:59:57,014
...don't send me a postcard.

1092
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,726
OK.

1093
02:00:07,652 --> 02:00:12,866
<i># We cannot see</i>

1094
02:00:13,596 --> 02:00:16,412
<i># In the future</i>

1095
02:00:16,829 --> 02:00:21,209
# No, no, no, no, no

1096
02:00:22,251 --> 02:00:25,380
# And it's hard

1097
02:00:26,006 --> 02:00:29,343
# To smile

1098
02:00:29,864 --> 02:00:32,993
# Through trials

1099
02:00:34,453 --> 02:00:41,440
# No, we cannot see

1100
02:00:42,379 --> 02:00:47,697
# Every pitfall

1101
02:00:48,948 --> 02:00:51,973
# But we must walk on

1102
02:00:52,911 --> 02:00:56,040
# By faith

1103
02:00:56,561 --> 02:00:59,168
# Each day

1104
02:00:59,481 --> 02:01:02,818
# Oh, Lord

1105
02:01:03,653 --> 02:01:08,867
# Whoa, on Monday

1106
02:01:09,701 --> 02:01:13,873
# Walk on

1107
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:16,584
# And on Tuesday

1108
02:01:16,584 --> 02:01:19,608
# Walk on

1109
02:01:19,713 --> 02:01:25,970
- # Whoa, let Jesus
- # Let Jesus be

1110
02:01:26,804 --> 02:01:32,227
- # Let him be your
- # Your guide

1111
02:01:32,227 --> 02:01:34,104
# Whoo-oo-oo

1112
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:37,441
# He's able

1113
02:01:37,441 --> 02:01:40,152
# He could carry your load

1114
02:01:40,257 --> 02:01:46,931
# And he could see way down the road

1115
02:01:47,035 --> 02:01:50,060
# Walk on

1116
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:54,335
You wanna drive, Rupert?

1117
02:01:56,942 --> 02:01:59,028
Yeah.

1118
02:02:01,114 --> 02:02:03,512
# On Monday

1119
02:02:03,617 --> 02:02:07,475

1120
02:02:07,579 --> 02:02:13,315
- # And on Tuesday

1121
02:02:13,419 --> 02:02:18,947

1124
02:02:29,896 --> 02:02:32,086

1125
02:02:32,191 --> 02:02:37,614
# And he can see way down the road

1126
02:02:38,865 --> 02:02:40,951
# Walk on...
