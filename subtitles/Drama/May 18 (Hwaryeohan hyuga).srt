9
00:00:017,060 --> 00:00:018,000
maintain a distance?

10
00:00:020,060 --> 00:00:022,000
if you're worried about the incident this morning ..

11
00:00:022,060 --> 00:00:024,000
sorry, but I'm still afraid of you

12
00:00:024,030 --> 00:00:025,000
so be careful

13
00:00:025,030 --> 00:00:026,040
that's why I changed

14
00:00:026,050 --> 00:00:028,000
after all I do not want to see you anymore

15
00:00:029,000 --> 00:00:030,060
of course because I consider you an enemy

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:034,060
though now I also feel strange with all this

17
00:00:035,000 --> 00:00:036,000
but this is a misunderstanding

18
00:00:037,000 --> 00:00:038,000
so, what happened this morning ..

19
00:00:038,030 --> 00:00:040,000

I do not know

72
00:03:011,000 --> 00:03:012,040
do not bother her just because her is beautiful

73
00:03:013,060 --> 00:03:015,000
I hear she is older than us

74
00:03:016,000 --> 00:03:019,060
I heard her ex-boyfriend like an exo member

75
00:03:020,030 --> 00:03:021,000
You believe that?

76

I want to say that to the teacher

98
00:05:034,000 --> 00:05:037,000

00:010:059,000 --> 00:011:00,000
aigoo

165
00:011:01,000 --> 00:011:03,000
stop jigging

166
00:011:05,000 --> 00:011:07,000
but who are you?

167
00:011:021,000 --> 00:011:022,000
how do I look?

168
00:011:024,000 --> 00:011:025,030
now it's okay right?

169
00:011:025,060 --> 00:011:027,000
I told you to stay away three steps away from me

170
00:011:027,020 --> 00:011:028,000
hey I'm not a bacteria or anything like that

171
00:011:028,010 --> 00:011:029,000
You're worse than bacteria

172
00:011:029,010 --> 00:011:031,000
this is a misunderstanding

173
00:011:033,000 --> 00:011:035,000
do you want to get a hit from me this morning?

174
00:011:047,000 --> 00:011:048,050
han na bi!

175
00:011:050,060 --> 00: 011:052,000
Do not you understand?

176
00:011:052,060 --> 00:011:054,000
I told you to stay away three steps from me

177
00:012:03,000 --> 00:012:04,000
wah, he changed

178
00:012:05,000 --> 00:012:06,060
how can he change?

179
00:012:07,000 --> 00:012:09,000
Has he changed because of that person?

180
00:012: 09,040 --> 00: 012: 011,000
do i have to ask her?

181
00: 012:011,030 --> 00:012:013,000
ask her about who is jin wook

182
00:012:013,030 --> 00:012:014,040
ah no, no

183
00:012:014,000 --> 00:012:017,000
If I asked without care, it would only cause trouble

184
00:012:018,000 --> 00:012:021.000
but if it is true that person is causing han na bi to kill himself ..

185
00:012:021,030 --> 00:012:023.000
What should I do?

186
00:012:023,030 --> 00:012:024.000
han na bi

187
00:012:024,40 --> 00:012:026.000
have you finished your school entry plan?

188
00:012:026,030 --> 00:12:029.000
aigoo, you really annoyed me

189
00:012:029,060 --> 00:012:031,000
follow me!

190
00:012:050 --> 00:012:052,000
What happened to you

191
00:012:052,050 --> 00:012:054.000
hey, hey let me go

192
00:012:056.000 --> 00:012:059.000
aigoo, why can you be like this?

193
00:012:059,020 --> 00:013:00,000
explain to me, quickly

194
00:013:01,000 --> 00:013:03,000
Do not exaggerate

195
00:013:03,030 --> 00:013:05,000
but like what I've said

196
00:013:05,030 --> 00:013:08,000
When someone suddenly changes like this, this may be the end of them

197
00:013:08,030 --> 00:013:09,040
really!

198
00:013:010,000 --> 00:013:011,000
You have to believe me

199
00:013:012.000 --> 00:013:018,000
~ Trust me ~
~ in my dream ~

200
00:013:019,000 --> 00:013:021,000
Hey! jang seul gi!

201
00:013:026.000 --> 00:013:027.000
What's wrong with him?

202
00:013:032,000 --> 00:013:034,000
hey oh kyung hwi what happen with your face?

203
00:013:037,000 --> 00:013:040,000
did you do plastic surgery last night?

204
00:013:040,030 --> 00:013:042,000
How can?

205
00:013:042,030 --> 00:013:044,000
wah, is this a dream?

206
00:013:044,030 --> 00:013:047,000
do not think with you like this I will not tell you to buy more bread!

207
00:013:048,000 --> 00:013:05,.000
because I'm still in a good mood so go find some more cream bread for us, we're hungry

208
00:013:051,050 --> 00:013:053,000
now still not too late

209
00:013:054.000 --> 00:013:059,000
that's why you have to run now and back before the bell rings

210
00:014:00,000 --> 00:014:02,000
what the hell? you have to go now

211
00:014:02,040 --> 00:014:03,000
come on!

212
00:014:03,030 --> 00:014:06,000
stop talking nonsense and think about how your life will change

213
00:014:06,050 --> 00:014:010,000
if you continue like this you can all go to jail

214
00:014:010,030 --> 00:014:011,000
What?

215
00:014:012,000 --> 00:014:014,000
hey we told you to buy creamy bread

216
00:014:014,020 --> 00:014:015,000
hey!

217
00:014:016,000 --> 00:014:018,000
if you want to fight to go elsewhere, do not get in the way

218
00:014:020,000 --> 00:014:024,000
han na bi,you still look pretty even when you're angry

219
00:014:024,050 --> 00:014:026,000
how long will you keep going like this?

220
00:014:026,030 --> 00:014:027,000
I've been waiting

221
00:014:027,030 --> 00:014:029,000
You have to make quick decisions

222
00:014:029,010 --> 00:014:030,000
Let's end here

223
00:014:030,030 --> 00:014:031,000
Why?

224
00:014:031,060 --> 00:014:033,000
do you also like han na bi?

225
00:014:034,000 --> 00:014:037,000
oh! That's why you acted cold yesterday?

226
00:014:037,060 --> 00:014:039,000
and you also changed your hairstyle

227
00:014:041,030 --> 00:014:045,000
na bi, it's all because you have not decided yet when you're single

228
00:014:045,010 --> 00:014:048,000
that's why even cats, dogs, and beggars are attracted to you

229
00:014:049,000 --> 00:014:050,000
there are cats, dogs, even pigs

230
00:014:050,050 --> 00:014:051,000
What?

231
00:014:052,000 --> 00:014:053,060
ah, lucky you're beautiful

232
00:014:054,000 --> 00:014:055,000
stop it

232
00:014:055,030 --> 00:014:058,000
do not get this pretty face angry

232
00:015:03,000 --> 00:015:04,060
my memory is still good

233
00:015:05,000 --> 00:015:07,000
you'll be grateful after I told you this

234
00:015:07,020 --> 00:015:08,000
what is this nonsense?

235
00:015:08,030 --> 00:015:011,000
What? you will be sorry

235
00:015:012,000 --> 00:015:013,000
your little friend should be careful

234
00:015:016,000 --> 00:015:017,000
why have not you gone yet?

235
00:015:018,000 --> 00:015:019,000
Go, hurry

236
00:015:033,000 --> 00:015:035,000
How about this?

237
00:015:045,030 --> 00:015:047,000

238
00:015:051,000 --> 00:015:052,000
