Hello?

30
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,956
Mr. Detective?

31
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,063
Huh? You're where?

32
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,330
And where is that?

33
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,609

34
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,249
Yeah?

35
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,790
Where are we, exactly?

36
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:30,160
I chose this place by chance.

37
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,762
Yeah, some are dead in here.

38
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,577
There are four survivors.

39
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,083
Everybody has to die sometime.

40
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,522
Hey Mr. Detective.
Who am I? Pop quiz!

41
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,491
Yeah, pop quiz.

42
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,833
Well, when you figure it out,
speak up, so I can hear you.

43
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,771
Hello?

44
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,042
Hello. Lost it.

45
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,513
Nothing. Can you hear me?

46
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,250
That's better.

47
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,156
It's stuffy in here.

48
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,418
I'm going out for a minute.

49
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,451
Hey Mr. Bus Driver...

50
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,587
Would you step outside with me?

51
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,562
How about letting the children go?

52
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,975
That's true.

53
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,977
Well, the children ARE our future

54
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,342
but all I really want right now

55
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:34,885
is to go out
and get some fresh air.

56
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:31,571
Wow... what a beautiful day.

57
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:39,652
Hey Mr. Bus Driver, you gotta name?

58
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:44,856
<i>SAW N . .. SNNN Makoto.</i>

59
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,558
Does Makoto mean anything?

60
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,830
Truthful, direct.

61
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,890
Great name!

62
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:03,672
Ever wish you were somebody else?

63
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,778
I don't know.

64
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,854
I really would have liked
to be someone else.

65
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,062
Now I'm just sick of everything.

66
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:29,400
Ready?

67
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,335

That's not true!
Don't be ridiculous!

Did Makoto say anything, dad?

104
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:21,784
He just said
he was going out for a bit.

105
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:24,484
Kiyoko, tea please.

106
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,256
I'll check the station
and the police.

107
00:19:34,356 --> 00:19:37,200
The sooner the better.

108

Here and there.

Yumi went back home to Hakata.

139
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:10,541
One of her old friends called.
She's back at the beauty parlor.

140
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:12,935
You could go visit her.

141
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:15,378
Silly. It's not so easy.

142
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:19,014
So, let's drink to his health.

143
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,711
Sorry, I don't drink anymore.

144
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:21,752
Why?

145
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,619
He doesn't have to.

146
00:29:24,712 --> 00:29:26,953
Makoto, the bath's ready.

147
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,395
What are you going to do for work?

148
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:36,231
I'll go see Shigeo tomorrow.

149
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,297
I see.

150
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:41,000
It's a good idea.

151
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,538
We should be able to help you.

152
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:46,134
No, thanks, really.

153
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,680
But that's day labor, isn't it'?

154
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,114
I'm not even sure yet.

155
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:53,180
I'll be OK.

156
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,189
He just said he's OK.
Leave him alone.

157
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:59,053
Now Mikiko, you stay out of this.

158
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:02,651
I'm going to bed.

159
00:30:03,084 --> 00:30:04,188

160
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,296

Papa, here's your new toothbrush.

162
00:33:35,296 --> 00:33:36,297
Good morning!

163
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,180
There's a typhoon coming.

164
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,975
You didn't sleep?

165
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,017
Not really.

166
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:56,894
Let's walk.

167
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:08,131
I gave everything to your brother.

168
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,510
He's doing well at city hall.

169
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,449
And his wife's behaving better.

170
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:23,753
Little Mikiko has all but grown up.

171
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,189
So you can do as you please.

172
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,445
Shigeo, see that? He's back.

173
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:50,539
Be cool about it, will ya?!

174
00:35:13,427 --> 00:35:18,137
Hey Shigeo, look who we got here!!

175
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:23,412
Hey Keiko, where's my tea?

176
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:31,288
Like I said Shigeo,
your old pal Makotds back.

177
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:32,982
What's your problem?!

178
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,889
He'll start tomorrow.
OK?

179
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,827
Shigeo, is that OK?

180
00:35:40,187 --> 00:35:41,962
Keiko, where's the tea?

181
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,229
Well, tomorrow morning then.

182
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,032
All right.

183
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,006
- Need a lift?
- No thanks, I'll walk.

184
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,980
Whatever, see you tomorrow.

185
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,785
What's with you, Shigeo?

186
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,065
What's with him?

187
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:21,734
He's probably happy.

188
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,393
Shigeo, you going drinking tonight?

189
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:51,830
I'm visiting mom, in the hospital.

190
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,834
So come along later.

191
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,503
We'll be celebrating his return.

192
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,371
Is it alright with you Makoto?

193
00:37:02,503 --> 00:37:04,574
Don't bug him, idiot!

194
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,145
Makoto that's alright.
I'm not going tonight either.

195
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:11,554
OK, how about tomorrow?

196
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:14,819
Any time.
We can go drinking whenever.

197
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:16,895
So just shut that motormouth.

198
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,691
Why are you so angry?

199
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,390
Makoto!

200
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:22,124
See you.

201
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:22,288
Shigeo, let's go!

202
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,067
Don't go out after dark Mikiko.

203
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,965
But why?

204
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:07,301
You haven't heard?

205
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:09,567
A killer's stalking young women.

206
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,074
What do you mean?

207
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,504
Another body was found
this morning, by the river.

208
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,841
Really?

209
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,712
But I'll be alright.
Makoto will watch over me,

210
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,285
right Uncle Makoto?

211
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,488
Mikiko, listen to your mother!

212
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,589
They say
it was the new teacher in town.

213
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,422
You mean Takekawa's teacher.

214
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:32,758
Really?!

215
00:39:45,532 --> 00:39:46,840
Good night.

216
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,134
Hey Makoto, see that house?

217
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:51,171
What about it?

218
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:53,110
That's where those kids live.

219
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,414
Mom vanished, dad died,

220
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:01,486
they're alone.
They don't go to school.

221
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:08,586
Let's get going.

222
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,954
Feels great!

223
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,178
What about the others?

224
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:04,744
They left already.

225
00:42:05,506 --> 00:42:09,249
Lucky ones.
I'm always doing overtime.

226
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:13,849
Thanks anyway, but I don't drink.

227
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:16,450
Really? Not at all?

228
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,257
I can't handle it.

229
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:19,623
Really?

230
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:22,692
Then I'll have it.

231
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:32,273
Sawai-san,
are you going straight home?

232
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:33,869
Why?

233
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:37,505
These serial killings...

234
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:42,277
One of the victims
lived right near me.

235
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:46,024
I was wondering
if you'd walk me home?

236
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,558
To Shiroishi?

237
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,898
Did you know, there was
a shocking incident near here?

238
00:43:01,395 --> 00:43:02,840
Haven't you heard?

239
00:43:03,463 --> 00:43:05,101
Hear what?

240
00:43:07,901 --> 00:43:10,472
That bus driver...

241
00:43:10,571 --> 00:43:11,811
Was me.

242
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:15,312
You're kidding!

243
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,648
I can't believe it!... Really?!

244
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:23,586
But you're a hero.
That's great.

245
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:32,761
Oh, I'm sorry.
Many people died, didn't they?

246
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,178
I'm sorry. Please don't be angry.

247
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:42,269
No, I'm not.

248
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:43,976
Really?

249
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:45,480
Yes, really...

250
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:49,419
Well, good.

251
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:11,469
Here we are.

252
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,441
Alright, see you.

253
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:18,646
Aren't you going to ask?

254
00:44:19,306 --> 00:44:20,444
What?

255
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:25,351
What everybody else asks...
whether I live alone?

256
00:44:25,445 --> 00:44:26,515
Well...

257
00:44:34,187 --> 00:44:35,598
Don't you want to come in?

258
00:44:37,057 --> 00:44:39,435
No, I've got to get back.

259
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,437
Thanks, good night.

260
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:15,331
There's nothing for you today.

261
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:19,842
You can go home <i>as</i> well.

262
00:45:22,536 --> 00:45:25,676
Watch out for my car!

263
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:37,690
Hey Makoto, let's go.

264
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,023
Shigeo...

265
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:43,528
The boss seemed strange today...

266
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:45,468
Is it something I did?

267
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:46,867
It's nothing.

268
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:23,270
Makoto!

269
00:47:57,657 --> 00:48:00,695
So! I hear you've got a girlfriend.

270
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:05,176
No, I haven't.

271
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:11,046
Word is you were out with
a young woman late last night.

272
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:18,946
So this girl isn't your girlfriend?

273
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:21,485
No.

274
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:26,921
Just walking out late
with a woman not your girlfriend?

275
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:34,339
It wasn't late.
It was only 8 p.m..

276
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,874
You went to her place, didn't you?

277
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:50,481
Come on, speak up.

278
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,457
You know why I'm asking...

279
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:05,597
With these murders lately,
nobody's above suspicion.

280
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,108
Vicious rumors start
from the smallest things.

281
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,804
You vanish. And then
suddenly reappear...

282
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:19,315
that in itself is suspicious.

283
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:20,476
Get it?

284
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:25,114
Yoshiyuki, now don't pick on
poor Makoto.

285
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,748
Even if there's no connection...

286
00:49:27,847 --> 00:49:29,884
if a rumor's circulating about you

287
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:33,726
we could be suspected as well:
me, my wife, my daughter.

288
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,025
It reflects badly on all of us.

289
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,407
We certainly don't care,
but think of Mikiko.

290
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,776
You're not involved?

291
00:49:56,376 --> 00:49:59,084
Why don't you answer me?

292
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:02,092
Of course he's not involved.

293
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,961
Just like when we were kids...

294
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:08,488
you just clam up and stick it out!

295
00:50:11,524 --> 00:50:13,697
Just like when mom died.

296
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:17,305
You refused to face the truth.

297
00:50:17,397 --> 00:50:19,968
That's so long ago.

298
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,212
Enough already...

299
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:26,417
You're up early tomorrow.
Get some sleep.

300
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:28,876
Think about it.

301
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:16,495
I fixed your old bike.

302
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,895
It's got a few good years left.

303
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:39,683
Thanks.

304
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,246
Remember me?

305
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:20,985
I ran away from home.

306
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:32,395
Can I stay here with you?

307
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,117
You haven't had breakfast yet?

308
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,127
I'll make it for you.

309
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:33,515
May I have the day off?

310
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:36,489
Yeah, sure... why not.

311
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:38,495
I'll be in tomorrow.

312
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,561
No problem.

313
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:43,566
Hey Shigeo...

314
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,397
I'll come in by myself.
Dad fixed my old bike.

315
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:55,344
Yeah, sure...

316
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:57,213
Thanks.

317
00:55:57,503 --> 00:55:58,743
Sorry.

318
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:55,021
Sorry... I was snoring, right'?

319
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,983
<i>When summer arrives
in the hamlet,</i>

320
00:59:29,248 --> 00:59:32,786
<i>the baby partridge chirps
with its high-pitched voice.</i>

321
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,610
Good morning.

322
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,019
Sit down, breakfast's almost ready.

323
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:30,569
Is this it?...

324
01:03:01,293 --> 01:03:02,863
It moves.

325
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:27,730
Remember me'?
Akihiko, your cousin.

326
01:03:33,859 --> 01:03:35,964
We met at grandpa's funeral.

327
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:37,772
Remember?

328
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:54,988
Go ahead, dig in!

329
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:13,839
Delicious, right?!

330
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:17,407
Kokura octopus dumplings
are the best!

331
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:20,746
People think Osaka dumplings
are the best.

332
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,014
But the ones from Kokura
are better.

333
01:04:25,911 --> 01:04:29,358
You agree? I'm glad.

334
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,221
Some have too much ginger.

335
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:36,493
That's a sin.
Should be just a shred.

336
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:55,650
Tonight.

337
01:04:55,741 --> 01:04:58,085
Why not order some sushi?

338
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:03,552
Hello.

339
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,905
When they ordered for four,

340
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:18,831
I just thought they were hungry.

341
01:05:19,565 --> 01:05:20,908
Yeah...

342
01:05:23,335 --> 01:05:25,975
You mean... they spoke?

343
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:28,608
No, they held up four fingers.

344
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:30,050
I see.

345
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,816
Mr. Sawai,

346
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:37,989
please help yourself.

347
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:46,934
I had no idea you were here.

348
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:48,928
Sorry.

349
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,440
No I didn't mean it like that.

350
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:59,849
If it's cool with them
it's cool with me.

351
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:05,320
How long will you be staying?

352
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:06,718
Don't know.

353
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,888
How about you?

354
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:16,495
Hey, what's up?

355
01:06:17,389 --> 01:06:21,098
What'd I say?

356
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:25,036
Sorry,

357
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:27,542
I really don”: have
anywhere else to go.

358
01:06:30,502 --> 01:06:33,210
I see.

359
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:38,220
Oh, so
you're really living here now?!

360
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:42,322
I'll be leaving
when school holiday's over

361
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,293
in about a month.

362
01:06:47,386 --> 01:06:48,797
Oh really?

363
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,566
He'll stay with us a month.
Good for you.

364
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:06,843
Hey, what gives?

365
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:09,477
Eat up!

366
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:13,284
Hey, Mr. Sawai, eat up!

367
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:42,646
I was a bit surprised.
I never imagined.

368
01:07:44,209 --> 01:07:46,951
He seems nice enough.

369
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:52,221
The kids are enchanted by him.

370
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:56,855
He's some kind of day worker.

371
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:02,566
I'll call if there's anything
to report.

372
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,741
Give my best to dad.

373
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:31,565
Let's start with the easiest.

374
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:05,968
Naoki, be serious!

375
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:10,400
Wait! Where are you going?

376
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:32,376
Perfect score?!

377
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:09,881
Shigeo...

378
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:12,353
check point ahead.

379
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:39,540
Another victim?!

380
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,635
What's up?

381
01:13:46,304 --> 01:13:48,477
Bad dreams?

382
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:52,717
Why do you ask?

383
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:58,689
Obvious, isn't it'?
Insomnia and night sweats?

384
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:16,774
See bad dreams often?

385
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:20,672
First time since I've been here.

386
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:23,984
Because I came?

387
01:14:24,309 --> 01:14:27,916
No, that has nothing to do with it.

388
01:14:28,346 --> 01:14:32,260
It is possible.
Could it be sub-conscious'?

389
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:34,728
Sorry.

390
01:14:39,257 --> 01:14:40,895
Why do you always apologise?

391
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:44,638
Well, I...

392
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:47,172
I'm not asking for an apology.

393
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:53,176
Akihiko, how old are you?

394
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:57,284
Almost 22.

395
01:15:00,445 --> 01:15:02,322
You're really mature for you age.

396
01:15:04,483 --> 01:15:07,362
Well, that would be a first.

397
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:14,027
Maybe because I have
a past like yours.

398
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:18,541
What do you mean?

399
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:23,106
I'll tell you about it some day.

400
01:15:27,839 --> 01:15:30,319
OK, good night then.

401
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,331
What now?

402
01:15:49,694 --> 01:15:53,540
I just wanted to say
your presence has really helped.

403
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:56,612
I mean...

404
01:15:57,836 --> 01:15:59,076
Thanks.

405
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,623
Don't mention it.

406
01:16:15,954 --> 01:16:20,027
Sawai-san, there's something here
for you from the insurance company.

407
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:21,531
Thanks.

408
01:16:32,404 --> 01:16:34,680
What do you think it is?

409
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:42,988
A second medical exam?
You OK?

410
01:16:43,982 --> 01:16:45,928
I'm alright.

411
01:16:54,559 --> 01:16:56,470
Put it on the desk.

412
01:16:58,597 --> 01:17:00,804
Don't forget to go to the clinic.

413
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:03,038
Yes, of course.

414
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,763
Sorry...

415
01:17:24,089 --> 01:17:28,162
The other day
I embarrassed you.

416
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:32,501
It wasn't your fault.

417
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,577
Want a sip?

418
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,578
I guess not...

419
01:17:44,376 --> 01:17:49,382
The other night I had a glass
and slept through my alarm clock.

420
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,194
You really can't hold your liquor!

421
01:17:58,323 --> 01:17:59,597
Overtime, again?

422
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:09,276
Is it true you are living
with children?

423
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:10,912
Yes.

424
01:18:21,046 --> 01:18:24,050
I was orphaned <i>as</i> well.

425
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:29,157
Both my parents died
when I was little.

426
01:18:30,555 --> 01:18:34,594
My relatives fought over me
for the insurance money.

427
01:18:36,428 --> 01:18:41,377
They split it amongst themselves,
and put me in an orphanage.

428
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:51,617
I wish I had someone like you
to take care of me.

429
01:18:57,282 --> 01:19:00,820
In fact, it's those kids
who are helping me.

430
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:03,096
They take care of me.

431
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:31,169
Oh, Sawai.

432
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:50,015
Sawai.

433
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:55,291
You have been called in
as a prime suspect.

434
01:22:57,021 --> 01:22:59,695
Early this morning, your colleague

435
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:04,536
Ms. Kono Keiko was found dead.
Did you know?

436
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:09,511
Yes, I heard about it a moment ago.

437
01:23:10,468 --> 01:23:11,811
Is that so?

438
01:23:13,104 --> 01:23:17,712
Where were you

439
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:20,986
between midnight and 2 a.m.?

440
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,382
I was at home in bed.

441
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:27,763
Are you referring

442
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:33,261
to the Tamura residence
where you are a lodger?

443
01:23:33,391 --> 01:23:35,064
Yes.

444
01:23:36,394 --> 01:23:38,806
Can anyone corroborate your story?

445
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:45,713
Everybody was asleep.

446
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,916
Sawai-san, is something wrong?

447
01:23:55,146 --> 01:23:56,591
No, I'm OK.

448
01:24:07,258 --> 01:24:14,472
Are you aware of the implications
of your present position?

449
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:18,847
Moments ago I informed you

450
01:24:19,003 --> 01:24:22,507
that you are as of now
our prime suspect in this case.

451
01:24:23,007 --> 01:24:24,577
It follows that

452
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:28,855
everything you say can be used
as evidence in a court of law.

453
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:30,957
Do you understand?

454
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,293
Then we will proceed...

455
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:40,834
Please answer truthfully.

456
01:24:43,194 --> 01:24:45,231
Last night at approximately 8 p.m.

457
01:24:45,329 --> 01:24:49,675
you escorted Ms. Kono
to her residence.

458
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:52,404
Is this correct?

459
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,947
Did you enter her apartment?

460
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,383
What did you do there?

461
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,659
Nothing really.

462
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,730
You engaged in sexual intercourse,

463
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:13,499
didn't you?!

464
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,799
Nothing happened.
We drank tea.

465
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:26,341
Where did you go after you left
Ms. Kane's apartment?

466
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:28,414
I went straight home.

467
01:25:29,507 --> 01:25:33,978
Do you know
where Ms. Kono went then?

468
01:25:34,078 --> 01:25:35,216
No.

469
01:25:36,547 --> 01:25:39,323
After she had you walk her
all of the way home,

470
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:41,897
why do you suppose
she'd go out alone after you left?

471
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:48,336
I have no idea.

472
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:51,603
Didn't you call her?

473
01:25:52,196 --> 01:25:53,971
I did not call her.

474
01:26:14,418 --> 01:26:16,125
Sawai-san...

475
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,335
Listen... this is

476
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:22,595
a murder investigation.

477
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,539
You do understand.

478
01:26:44,148 --> 01:26:46,094
You are lying.

479
01:26:47,752 --> 01:26:51,723
Concluding sexual intercourse
with Ms. Kono,

480
01:26:52,223 --> 01:26:56,035
you left and then called her

481
01:26:57,028 --> 01:26:58,439
or perhaps...

482
01:26:59,997 --> 01:27:03,467
hid and waited for her to leave

483
01:27:03,568 --> 01:27:05,980
at which time you hunted her down

484
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,175
and killed her by the riverside.

485
01:27:09,774 --> 01:27:11,253
Isn't that the truth?!

486
01:27:16,647 --> 01:27:18,320
What's the matter?

487
01:27:21,485 --> 01:27:25,456
That is what happened, isn't it!'?

488
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:30,598
- I haven't killed anybody.
- But you did lie in wait for her!

489
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,874
No I did not.

490
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:38,445
I had no reason to kill that woman.

491
01:28:06,264 --> 01:28:08,335
Let me be frank.

492
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,740
I believe you are the killer

493
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:17,482
and the perpetrator
of this spate of killings.

494
01:28:19,677 --> 01:28:22,590
It's all just intuition

495
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:25,526
but since that incident
on the bus

496
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:29,592
I knew you would turn bad.

497
01:28:30,288 --> 01:28:32,666
I knew that we would meet again

498
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,868
in circumstances like these.

499
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,973
Your eyes were just like

500
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,613
those of that killer.

501
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:55,184
I have done nothing.

502
01:32:14,778 --> 01:32:15,882
Thanks.

503
01:32:20,518 --> 01:32:22,054
I really appreciate it.

504
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:38,979
Hi.

505
01:32:42,173 --> 01:32:43,345
Sorry.

506
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:49,755
You really are a loser, Sawai-san.

507
01:32:51,015 --> 01:32:52,289
Sorry.

508
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:57,364
Our family is about ready
to kick you out, you know.

509
01:32:57,955 --> 01:33:00,492
What will you do? Leave?

510
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:08,670
I told my mom

511
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:11,309
that you weren't the killer.

512
01:33:13,771 --> 01:33:18,015
But they're really worried
you're after the kids' money

513
01:33:20,444 --> 01:33:22,720
that they want to be spending.

514
01:33:24,582 --> 01:33:26,823
I told her you aren't like that.

515
01:33:28,085 --> 01:33:29,291
Thanks.

516
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:34,928
You may not realise it,
but you're quite a narcissist.

517
01:33:35,392 --> 01:33:37,929
You can do whatever you want

518
01:33:38,028 --> 01:33:40,167
but leave the kids out of it.

519
01:33:40,898 --> 01:33:42,343
Sorry.

520
01:33:44,602 --> 01:33:47,105
Boy, you're really a piece of work.

521
01:33:47,905 --> 01:33:51,876
You think you can do anything
with an apology?

522
01:33:52,042 --> 01:33:53,851
At least until now.

523
01:33:58,182 --> 01:34:02,995
But it won't work when my family
descends on this place.

524
01:34:03,954 --> 01:34:05,763
I won't be able to help.

525
01:34:21,972 --> 01:34:25,681
They won't listen to me.

526
01:36:02,406 --> 01:36:05,012
<i>Did you see, Kozue?</i>

527
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:09,247
<i>The ocean.</i>

528
01:36:12,015 --> 01:36:13,619
<i>Did you see it?</i>

529
01:36:15,386 --> 01:36:17,024
<i>Did you see it?</i>

530
01:36:20,023 --> 01:36:21,434
<i>The ocean.</i>

531
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:59,028
<i>To.' Sawai Sex]!
From: Sawai Yumiko</i>

532
01:37:59,122 --> 01:38:02,103
Uncle Makoto, I'm sorry.

533
01:38:02,426 --> 01:38:03,700
What for?

534
01:38:03,894 --> 01:38:06,602
Mom and dad didn't try to help you.

535
01:38:08,265 --> 01:38:11,644
Don't worry. It was expected.

536
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:15,712
Grandpa and I believe in you.

537
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:20,249
I believe in you too

538
01:38:20,344 --> 01:38:23,120
and even in your parents.

539
01:38:25,282 --> 01:38:27,592
Don't worry about it.

540
01:38:36,193 --> 01:38:37,570
What's the matter?

541
01:38:40,564 --> 01:38:42,441
Please don't cry.

542
01:38:44,935 --> 01:38:48,576
You never cried <i>as</i> a child.

543
01:38:52,943 --> 01:38:54,581
But you don't understand.

544
01:38:56,079 --> 01:38:57,786
In the beginning,

545
01:39:00,284 --> 01:39:03,424
I, too, suspected you, uncle.

546
01:39:09,526 --> 01:39:11,972
But that's normal.

547
01:39:12,563 --> 01:39:14,804
I feel so ashamed.

548
01:39:15,933 --> 01:39:18,573
But it's not your fault.

549
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:21,205
It's not anybody's fault.

550
01:39:27,578 --> 01:39:31,424
If anyone, it's me to blame...
for making you worry.

551
01:39:32,849 --> 01:39:34,385
Please forgive me.

552
01:39:39,523 --> 01:39:41,093
Now, dry your tears.

553
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:47,605
Go home to your schoolwork.

554
01:39:56,173 --> 01:39:57,709
<i>Uncle Makoto,</i>

555
01:39:58,442 --> 01:40:00,080
<i>will you go to see Aunt Yumi?</i>

556
01:40:00,877 --> 01:40:02,356
<i>I suppose.</i>

557
01:40:03,647 --> 01:40:06,218
<i>I want to see her too.</i>

558
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:10,332
<i>Why don't you?</i>

559
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:13,367
<i>I'll tell her that you miss her.</i>

560
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:20,107
<i>She really loves you,
if“ make her happy.</i>

561
01:40:32,609 --> 01:40:35,613
<i>NOTIFICATION OF DIVORCE</i>

562
01:41:30,934 --> 01:41:33,938
It's good to see you're OK...

563
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:37,981
Yes, you too.

564
01:41:39,276 --> 01:41:40,812
Sleeping?

565
01:41:43,113 --> 01:41:44,387
Some.

566
01:41:46,049 --> 01:41:48,029
Still having nightmares?

567
01:41:50,387 --> 01:41:52,128
From time to time.

568
01:42:01,798 --> 01:42:07,305
I was surprised to hear
you'd returned.

569
01:42:08,138 --> 01:42:11,779
Why'd you come back?
Homesick?

570
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:21,793
So I could start over.

571
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:28,332
But in the end,

572
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:31,706
it didn't work out.

573
01:42:35,332 --> 01:42:37,642
I thought I could start over,

574
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:41,841
but things just continued.

575
01:42:44,975 --> 01:42:46,716
Start over.

576
01:42:47,778 --> 01:42:49,553
That's not true!

577
01:42:50,514 --> 01:42:52,494
You just ran away.

578
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:59,626
Maybe you're right.

579
01:43:01,725 --> 01:43:03,762
You were self-obsessed,

580
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:07,336
never thinking about me.

581
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,438
I'm sorry.

582
01:43:12,969 --> 01:43:15,813
You left me
in that sad little town.

583
01:43:46,469 --> 01:43:49,473
You're really a monster, Makoto.

584
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:57,481
I'm living with another man now.

585
01:44:02,152 --> 01:44:03,529
Really?

586
01:44:07,157 --> 01:44:08,602
Happy for me?

587
01:44:12,596 --> 01:44:13,768
No.

588
01:44:14,297 --> 01:44:15,776
I don't know.

589
01:44:17,767 --> 01:44:19,303
You really are terrible.

590
01:44:22,873 --> 01:44:23,851
Sorry.

591
01:44:51,134 --> 01:44:52,670
Well then...

592
01:44:53,436 --> 01:44:54,574
Yeah?

593
01:44:55,405 --> 01:44:56,850
Take care of yourself.

594
01:44:57,474 --> 01:44:58,714
You too.

595
01:45:03,246 --> 01:45:04,589
Makoto?

596
01:45:08,051 --> 01:45:10,554
Did you ever think about
starting over with me'?

597
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:18,398
That's why I came back.

598
01:45:22,732 --> 01:45:24,177
It was too late.

599
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:31,745
Yumiko?

600
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:38,317
Do you think one can live
only for others?

601
01:45:43,687 --> 01:45:47,658
Sorry. I'm talking nonsense.

602
01:45:49,025 --> 01:45:50,834
I don't know...

603
01:45:53,063 --> 01:45:54,804
It would be great if you could.

604
01:45:58,234 --> 01:46:00,077
You. I think you could do it.

605
01:46:05,208 --> 01:46:07,814
But you couldn't do it for me.

606
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:11,758
I'm so sorry.

607
01:46:12,215 --> 01:46:13,421
Don't be.

608
01:46:14,184 --> 01:46:15,492
Forgive me.

609
01:46:16,386 --> 01:46:18,889
You really did live for me.

610
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:22,331
I know you did.

611
01:47:52,949 --> 01:47:54,553
Come on. Get up.

612
01:48:50,473 --> 01:48:51,884
He's crying.

613
01:50:54,297 --> 01:50:55,640
Who are you?

614
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,145
I live here.

615
01:50:59,335 --> 01:51:00,837
Kid's relation, huh?

616
01:51:01,204 --> 01:51:02,376
I'm their cousin.

617
01:51:02,572 --> 01:51:03,949
Makoto around?

618
01:51:06,876 --> 01:51:09,550
- He's asleep.
- So wake him up.

619
01:51:09,812 --> 01:51:11,052
Why?

620
01:51:11,714 --> 01:51:14,160
None of your business, get to it.

621
01:51:15,351 --> 01:51:17,592
Excuse me, but who exactly are you

622
01:51:17,687 --> 01:51:19,894
to be giving me orders?!

623
01:51:19,989 --> 01:51:22,128
Loudmouth! Tell him it's Shigeo.

624
01:51:22,225 --> 01:51:23,704
Shigeo what?

625
01:51:23,793 --> 01:51:25,397
You want your butt kicked?!

626
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:29,338
Then shut up and do <i>as</i> you're told.

627
01:51:29,499 --> 01:51:31,410
What was that?

628
01:51:32,001 --> 01:51:33,776
What are you on about?

629
01:51:36,372 --> 01:51:39,046
Makoto, hurry up.
The boss' calling.

630
01:51:39,142 --> 01:51:40,985
Are we from the same town'?

631
01:51:41,077 --> 01:51:43,387
<i>- Where's that'?
- Mo“.</i>

632
01:51:43,479 --> 01:51:45,425
So what's with the big city accent?

633
01:51:45,515 --> 01:51:47,358
I grew up in Tokyo.

634
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:49,123
What's with your small-town accent?

635
01:51:49,218 --> 01:51:51,789
You gonna watch your mouth.

636
01:51:51,921 --> 01:51:53,127
Sorry, Akihiko.

637
01:51:53,289 --> 01:51:55,633
Watch it, you little snot.

638
01:52:00,697 --> 01:52:02,973
I'll kick his butt.

639
01:52:24,987 --> 01:52:29,993
See'? This one raises the arm
up and down.

640
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:36,210
And this one operates the boom,

641
01:52:36,799 --> 01:52:38,745
and this one's for the bucket.

642
01:52:40,203 --> 01:52:43,673
Here's the safety lock.
Want to try it on your own'?

643
01:52:56,185 --> 01:52:57,755
That's it.

644
01:52:58,354 --> 01:53:00,129
Good. That's it.

645
01:53:01,591 --> 01:53:03,161
Now move the boom.

646
01:53:06,963 --> 01:53:08,874
That's right.

647
01:53:09,465 --> 01:53:10,569
Now try digging-

648
01:53:11,134 --> 01:53:13,808
Bring the bucket forward.

649
01:53:15,037 --> 01:53:16,539
You're getting it.

650
01:53:34,624 --> 01:53:36,900
Why did you miss your check-up?

651
01:53:40,196 --> 01:53:41,470
I'll go in sometime.

652
01:53:41,697 --> 01:53:44,837
That's a pretty nasty cough.
At least cut back on the smokes.

653
01:53:47,069 --> 01:53:48,377
Yeah, I guess.

654
01:53:49,806 --> 01:53:52,844
I'll put you on the steam shovel.

655
01:53:55,011 --> 01:53:57,355
I just remembered.

656
01:53:58,181 --> 01:53:59,319
What's that?

657
01:53:59,749 --> 01:54:03,287
Remember how much we were
fascinated with bus drivers?

658
01:54:05,555 --> 01:54:07,125
You could go back to driving.

659
01:54:07,957 --> 01:54:10,460
It wasn't what I had expected.

660
01:54:10,626 --> 01:54:15,871
In fact, all you do is follow
the same routes over and over.

661
01:54:18,568 --> 01:54:20,570
Then that busjack happened.

662
01:54:21,571 --> 01:54:23,778
And that was it.

663
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:27,752
That'd happen in any job.

664
01:54:30,713 --> 01:54:35,492
But operating that steam shovel
kind of brought me back.

665
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:37,898
But not in the same way.

666
01:54:41,224 --> 01:54:42,567
With another kind of bus.

667
01:54:43,659 --> 01:54:45,502
What do you mean?

668
01:54:47,463 --> 01:54:48,840
I don't know.

669
01:54:50,733 --> 01:54:52,269
You don't know?

670
01:55:09,986 --> 01:55:11,863
A new kind of bus, huh?

671
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:18,231
Hitoshi, we're taking off.

672
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:18,854
Naoki...

673
01:57:24,253 --> 01:57:26,096
Naoki, look at me.

674
01:57:34,096 --> 01:57:36,042
You smashed the graves, didn't you?

675
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:51,122
Feel better?

676
01:58:19,775 --> 01:58:23,621
Go to sleep now,
don't worry.

677
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:26,287
I'm here with you.

678
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:33,031
Don't cry.

679
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:36,292
Are you in pain?

680
01:58:38,594 --> 01:58:41,507
You hit your head, didn't you?

681
01:58:56,712 --> 01:58:59,886
First thing in the morning,

682
01:59:00,282 --> 01:59:02,853
Akihiko will fix everything.

683
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:11,627
So please don't cry.

684
01:59:32,014 --> 01:59:36,326
Are you mad at Naoki?

685
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:40,726
Even after what he did?

686
01:59:46,195 --> 01:59:47,265
Really?

687
01:59:52,168 --> 01:59:55,945
How did you know

688
01:59:56,071 --> 01:59:59,780
what he did?

689
02:00:04,647 --> 02:00:08,254
I'm sorry, I won't ask...

690
02:00:08,551 --> 02:00:10,258
Just please don't cry.

691
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:18,070
Hey Kozue,

692
02:00:20,496 --> 02:00:24,569
let's all go away, together,
and start all over again.

693
02:00:32,975 --> 02:00:35,455
OK, it's settled then.

694
02:00:38,147 --> 02:00:39,353
That way,

695
02:00:40,282 --> 02:00:43,991
we can always be together.

696
02:00:47,690 --> 02:00:49,033
Listen,

697
02:00:51,427 --> 02:00:52,838
Kozue,

698
02:00:53,262 --> 02:00:57,870
first you'll have to eat
to get your strength back.

699
02:01:02,137 --> 02:01:04,378
I'll go fix something for you.

700
02:01:10,980 --> 02:01:13,984
You have to let me go,
if you want me to cook something.

701
02:01:16,986 --> 02:01:18,397
Not yet, huh?

702
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:28,335
OK, I'll stay right here with you.

703
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:32,942
So just rest and relax.

704
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:25,654
What's that?

705
02:03:26,248 --> 02:03:27,318
I bought it.

706
02:03:27,649 --> 02:03:30,357
Wha... what for?

707
02:03:31,653 --> 02:03:34,156
So the four of us can go on a trip.

708
02:03:37,126 --> 02:03:39,265
What kind of moronic idea is that?

709
02:03:39,862 --> 02:03:42,502
The kid's don't want to leave.

710
02:03:42,865 --> 02:03:44,845
Stop trying to pressure them.

711
02:03:45,834 --> 02:03:48,576
We've got to get out of this place.

712
02:03:48,804 --> 02:03:50,078
Why?

713
02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:53,142
Because we have to.

714
02:03:53,976 --> 02:03:57,753
Your paranoia's got you
escaping reality.

715
02:03:58,313 --> 02:04:01,419
They're better off staying put,
quietly, right here.

716
02:04:01,884 --> 02:04:05,297
You want to upset them
by pure egotism?

717
02:04:21,036 --> 02:04:22,845
It doesn't have an automatic door.

718
02:04:23,672 --> 02:04:28,143
It's used, but if we fix it up
we can live in it.

719
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:31,855
With some beds and a table.

720
02:04:33,882 --> 02:04:35,190
You want to help?

721
02:04:39,288 --> 02:04:40,892
You're too much.

722
02:04:41,557 --> 02:04:45,300
I didn't know
you were such a Peter Pan.

723
02:04:45,761 --> 02:04:47,638
I give up.

724
02:04:48,864 --> 02:04:51,037
You're impossible.

725
02:04:52,267 --> 02:04:53,507
I'm outta here...

726
02:04:54,002 --> 02:04:55,379
C'mon Naoki.

727
02:04:57,739 --> 02:04:59,548
Kozue, let's go.

728
02:06:43,145 --> 02:06:44,317
OK...

729
02:06:46,582 --> 02:06:47,925
I give in...

730
02:06:49,318 --> 02:06:51,821
Suit yourselves.

731
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:01,672
Let's take it out for a spin.

732
02:07:16,178 --> 02:07:17,179
Wait for me!

733
02:07:17,879 --> 02:07:19,881
Close the door,
it's not automatic...

734
02:09:18,066 --> 02:09:19,636
Hey Shigeo, thanks a lot.

735
02:09:22,537 --> 02:09:23,811
Here's the new kind of bus.

736
02:09:24,406 --> 02:09:25,578
Yeah, completely different.

737
02:09:30,312 --> 02:09:32,952
Hey Mr. Tokyo,
wake up and lend a hand.

738
02:09:33,582 --> 02:09:35,289
Who's Tokyo?

739
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:36,494
You mean me?

740
02:09:36,585 --> 02:09:38,394
Get in gear, Tokyo.

741
02:09:38,687 --> 02:09:41,429
Enough small-town attitude!

742
02:09:41,523 --> 02:09:43,366
You started, Tokyo.

743
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:49,699
I didn't say anything, Hicktown.

744
02:09:49,798 --> 02:09:52,711
I'm from Yahata.

745
02:09:52,834 --> 02:09:54,973
Well excuse me Mr. Yahata.

746
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:11,021
Sawai-san, dinner is served.

747
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,030
Thanks. I'll be right in.

748
02:10:29,371 --> 02:10:30,816
What are you doing?

749
02:10:33,074 --> 02:10:34,644
I bought a bus.

750
02:10:45,187 --> 02:10:46,598
Planning another escape?

751
02:10:48,757 --> 02:10:51,237
More or less.

752
02:10:53,061 --> 02:10:54,802
That won't change anything.

753
02:10:57,466 --> 02:10:59,070
You want to come along?

754
02:11:00,669 --> 02:11:02,307
Is that supposed to be funny?

755
02:11:07,642 --> 02:11:11,818
We need some time
to find ourselves.

756
02:11:12,681 --> 02:11:16,561
Could you leave us alone
for a while?

757
02:11:20,055 --> 02:11:22,934
Not if people
keep turning up dead.

758
02:11:26,795 --> 02:11:28,741
There will be no more murders.

759
02:11:40,075 --> 02:11:41,486
Sawai,

760
02:11:44,246 --> 02:11:46,157
I really don't like you.

761
02:11:49,351 --> 02:11:53,458
I can tell you think
my work is meaningless.

762
02:11:57,759 --> 02:12:00,399
Maybe you are right.

763
02:12:04,299 --> 02:12:05,437
But

764
02:12:07,502 --> 02:12:09,743
I cannot admit that.

765
02:12:12,207 --> 02:12:13,948
Well then, that's fine.

766
02:12:17,546 --> 02:12:18,854
You'll be back, right?

767
02:12:22,384 --> 02:12:24,057
I have no place to come back to.

768
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:03,991
OK, we're off.

769
02:14:10,525 --> 02:14:12,869
Take care, Shigeo.

770
02:15:58,733 --> 02:16:00,872
Isn't this your old bus route?

771
02:17:24,052 --> 02:17:26,191
We're starting off from right here.

772
02:17:28,489 --> 02:17:30,435
Take a good long look.

773
02:18:13,134 --> 02:18:15,045
Oh, I should tell you...

774
02:18:16,671 --> 02:18:17,706
What?

775
02:18:18,907 --> 02:18:22,286
I said I'd experienced
what you had, remember?

776
02:18:23,344 --> 02:18:24,823
Oh yeah!

777
02:18:26,547 --> 02:18:27,855
In fact,

778
02:18:30,919 --> 02:18:36,028
I came really close
to being killed once too

779
02:18:36,124 --> 02:18:39,230
by a Yakuza, friend of a friend,
with a gun.

780
02:18:41,696 --> 02:18:42,868
Really?!

781
02:18:44,232 --> 02:18:47,270
My friend saved me
and I escaped.

782
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:50,376
When was this?

783
02:18:51,105 --> 02:18:52,379
Four years ago.

784
02:18:53,808 --> 02:18:55,310
High school senior year.

785
02:18:57,278 --> 02:19:01,454
The Yakuza killed himself,
and my friend vanished.

786
02:19:02,684 --> 02:19:04,561
I haven't seen him since.

787
02:19:06,421 --> 02:19:07,900
Really?

788
02:19:10,591 --> 02:19:12,366
I wonder what he's up to?

789
02:19:15,663 --> 02:19:17,802
Did you ever go back there?

790
02:19:18,533 --> 02:19:22,174
Of course not.
What would I do there?

791
02:19:23,604 --> 02:19:26,414
That's like returning
to the crime scene.

792
02:19:27,909 --> 02:19:29,684
I wasn't the criminal.

793
02:19:31,346 --> 02:19:33,792
You watch too much TV.

794
02:19:39,520 --> 02:19:44,026
It might be worth
revisiting some day.

795
02:19:45,059 --> 02:19:46,231
Why?

796
02:19:49,163 --> 02:19:50,972
But I don't want to.

797
02:20:08,483 --> 02:20:10,588
I really thought I was a goner,

798
02:20:11,719 --> 02:20:13,198
that he would kill me.

799
02:20:19,227 --> 02:20:21,571
There were two corpses
in front of me.

800
02:20:23,231 --> 02:20:25,233
I was terrified.

801
02:20:27,001 --> 02:20:28,309
You know?

802
02:20:30,004 --> 02:20:32,280
Weren't you afraid, yourself?

803
02:20:36,444 --> 02:20:39,550
Three of us, Naoki, Kozue, and me,

804
02:20:40,281 --> 02:20:42,090
we survived.

805
02:20:43,151 --> 02:20:45,153
I wanted to go back

806
02:20:47,955 --> 02:20:49,901
in order to start over.

807
02:20:59,133 --> 02:21:01,272
Well I'm never going back.

808
02:21:20,154 --> 02:21:21,292
Kozue.

809
02:21:41,042 --> 02:21:43,682
Put some coffee in the curry,
it'll be good.

810
02:21:56,390 --> 02:21:57,698
Hey Naoki!

811
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:09,940
Sawai-san!

812
02:23:17,171 --> 02:23:18,616
Hey everybody!

813
02:23:43,564 --> 02:23:46,340
Akihiko, I'm going to bed.

814
02:23:46,567 --> 02:23:47,841
Good night.

815
02:26:59,226 --> 02:27:04,039
Is Aomori too far?

816
02:27:10,237 --> 02:27:13,184
My friend's a projectionist,

817
02:27:13,441 --> 02:27:15,114
in the town hall there.

818
02:27:16,677 --> 02:27:19,487
I thought about going this summer.

819
02:27:25,753 --> 02:27:29,291
He knows a Native American
who can bend spoons

820
02:27:30,324 --> 02:27:34,500
who healed him
with a miracle remedy.

821
02:27:38,566 --> 02:27:40,239
Aomori?

822
02:27:43,237 --> 02:27:46,946
D'you think our little bus
can make it?

823
02:33:45,933 --> 02:33:49,642
Stop, brake!
The one the middle!

824
02:39:48,828 --> 02:39:50,205
Welcome!

825
02:39:59,472 --> 02:40:00,712
What're you gonna get?

826
02:40:05,212 --> 02:40:06,418
Miss!

827
02:40:16,056 --> 02:40:18,969
May I take your order?

828
02:40:19,092 --> 02:40:20,730
Rice with hot pickles.

829
02:40:24,531 --> 02:40:25,737
One green salad.

830
02:40:31,605 --> 02:40:33,414
One meatball soup lunch.

831
02:40:34,608 --> 02:40:36,019
Sawai-san, what about you?

832
02:40:36,276 --> 02:40:38,847
I'll have the meatball soup, also.

833
02:40:41,881 --> 02:40:43,155
Something wrong?

834
02:40:44,618 --> 02:40:46,620
She looks just like an old friend.

835
02:40:46,753 --> 02:40:47,959
Where from?

836
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:08,578
You OK?

837
02:41:10,010 --> 02:41:11,353
Carsick?

838
02:41:13,179 --> 02:41:14,283
Excuse me!

839
02:41:14,381 --> 02:41:15,655
What is it?

840
02:41:16,116 --> 02:41:18,027
My friend just threw up.

841
02:42:17,377 --> 02:42:18,947
Naoki's gone.

842
02:42:26,453 --> 02:42:28,592
We'll get further if we split up.

843
02:42:28,722 --> 02:42:30,099
OK, I'll look over here.

844
02:43:55,508 --> 02:43:56,646
Find him?

845
02:43:57,777 --> 02:43:59,620
He was asleep when I got back.

846
02:44:46,526 --> 02:44:49,530
<i>Woman found murdered</i>

847
02:45:38,578 --> 02:45:40,558
Sawai-san, you look terrible.

848
02:45:40,713 --> 02:45:42,056
Yeah?

849
02:45:43,883 --> 02:45:46,727
- You sick or something?
- Sort of.

850
02:45:53,126 --> 02:45:55,663
Wow, you're burning up!

851
02:45:55,762 --> 02:45:57,332
I guess so.

852
02:45:57,830 --> 02:45:59,468
Better stay in bed.

853
02:46:00,500 --> 02:46:03,743
I guess I should.

854
02:46:07,707 --> 02:46:12,247
You've still got that cold
from jail.

855
02:46:16,215 --> 02:46:18,422
Naoki, let's go to the bath house.

856
02:46:22,488 --> 02:46:24,934
Kozue, let's go clean up.

857
02:47:18,811 --> 02:47:21,155
Aren't you coming, Naoki?

858
02:47:25,451 --> 02:47:27,658
Are you sick, too?

859
02:47:28,988 --> 02:47:30,558
That's too bad.

860
02:47:43,036 --> 02:47:44,640
Water for the medicine.

861
02:47:53,379 --> 02:47:57,657
You guys rest up and get well.

862
02:47:58,251 --> 02:48:00,731
Don't forget your medicine.

863
02:48:01,587 --> 02:48:03,123
Let's go Kozue.

864
02:49:28,474 --> 02:49:29,714
What's happening?

865
02:49:29,976 --> 02:49:31,922
He disappeared again.

866
02:49:48,928 --> 02:49:51,101
Split up again?

867
02:49:51,764 --> 02:49:54,040
No. Let's stay together.

868
02:49:54,133 --> 02:49:56,579
Don't worry, I'm feeling better.

869
02:49:57,503 --> 02:49:59,574
I no longer trust you.

870
02:50:00,506 --> 02:50:01,985
What are you talking about?

871
02:50:03,676 --> 02:50:07,317
A woman was killed
in the town we just left.

872
02:50:09,649 --> 02:50:12,186
It's either you or Naoki.

873
02:50:13,853 --> 02:50:15,924
Why didn't you tell me?

874
02:50:16,022 --> 02:50:19,367
I didn't trust you.
I know who you are.

875
02:50:19,559 --> 02:50:23,439
I struggled like you.
I thought about killing.

876
02:50:23,629 --> 02:50:25,631
It didn't frighten me.

877
02:50:25,731 --> 02:50:27,642
Don't be foolish.

878
02:50:28,134 --> 02:50:30,774
You never considered it?

879
02:50:34,707 --> 02:50:38,416
Yes, I've thought about it.
I too had the urge.

880
02:50:39,412 --> 02:50:42,950
How could I live if I ever gave in?

881
02:50:45,218 --> 02:50:47,220
If I'm ever killing others...

882
02:50:48,287 --> 02:50:50,528
it means I'm no longer who I am.

883
02:50:51,224 --> 02:50:53,534
Well I resisted, too!

884
02:50:53,626 --> 02:50:55,196
That's enough.

885
02:50:57,730 --> 02:51:00,734
Stay here and watch over Kozue.

886
02:51:00,933 --> 02:51:03,277
- No!
- Trust me, will you?!

887
02:53:42,194 --> 02:53:45,664
Why can't I kill?

888
02:53:52,271 --> 02:53:53,909
I didn't say that.

889
02:54:10,289 --> 02:54:11,529
Let go of the knife.

890
02:54:12,091 --> 02:54:13,229
Let go!

891
02:54:24,503 --> 02:54:26,278
What shall I do?

892
02:54:36,582 --> 02:54:37,754
Does it hurt?

893
02:54:39,852 --> 02:54:41,490
Do you want me to try killing?

894
02:54:42,855 --> 02:54:45,301
We could find someone
to kill together...

895
02:54:46,459 --> 02:54:48,097
What do you think, Naoki?

896
02:54:50,229 --> 02:54:54,439
Let's go. Let's kill someone.

897
02:55:02,007 --> 02:55:03,281
What is it?

898
02:55:04,543 --> 02:55:07,490
You want to kill somebody, right?

899
02:55:40,079 --> 02:55:41,581
If you want to kill,

900
02:55:43,215 --> 02:55:46,662
why don't we start with
the person dearest to you?

901
02:55:56,495 --> 02:55:58,406
Naoki...

902
02:55:59,298 --> 02:56:01,244
let's go back to the bus.

903
02:56:35,601 --> 02:56:37,137
Hold on tight now.

904
02:56:38,704 --> 02:56:42,117
You don't fall and hurt yourself.

905
02:56:53,686 --> 02:56:57,657
We can ride in circles like this

906
02:57:00,726 --> 02:57:03,206
or go back and kill Kozue.

907
02:57:04,597 --> 02:57:06,042
What will it be?

908
02:57:09,735 --> 02:57:12,682
Decide by our third time round.

909
02:57:53,846 --> 02:57:59,125
We can keep going round here.

910
02:59:16,528 --> 02:59:17,802
Naoki...

911
02:59:19,231 --> 02:59:21,074
Promise me one thing.

912
02:59:26,171 --> 02:59:27,912
I'm not saying that you must live,

913
02:59:29,742 --> 02:59:31,050
but I am asking you

914
02:59:31,977 --> 02:59:33,479
not to die.

915
02:59:40,652 --> 02:59:42,256
We'll meet again.

916
02:59:47,459 --> 02:59:49,063
We'll be waiting for you.

917
02:59:51,764 --> 02:59:53,334
We'll come to get you.

918
03:00:00,105 --> 03:00:01,482
Understand?

919
03:00:24,797 --> 03:00:27,437
OK, now let's go.

920
03:00:32,704 --> 03:00:35,708
<i>POLICE STATION</i>

921
03:01:16,381 --> 03:01:17,758
What happened to your hand?

922
03:01:19,418 --> 03:01:20,556
Nothing.

923
03:01:27,793 --> 03:01:31,570
It was hard.
She suddenly burst out crying.

924
03:01:32,564 --> 03:01:35,306
I'm no good with crying women.

925
03:01:35,601 --> 03:01:37,706
I couldn't go in there.

926
03:01:51,016 --> 03:01:53,053
She knows.

927
03:01:55,787 --> 03:01:57,562
Without using words,

928
03:01:58,924 --> 03:02:01,097
no matter how far apart,

929
03:02:02,794 --> 03:02:04,432
she can communicate with him.

930
03:07:43,902 --> 03:07:45,813
He'll spend the rest of his life

931
03:07:45,904 --> 03:07:48,214
in jails or institutions.

932
03:07:56,448 --> 03:07:58,121
It's sad,

933
03:07:58,250 --> 03:08:01,925
but shouldn't we lock up
people who cross the line?

934
03:08:07,792 --> 03:08:10,534
It's probably
the best thing for him.

935
03:08:23,875 --> 03:08:24,876
Get out!

936
03:08:35,954 --> 03:08:37,433
The best thing?!

937
03:08:37,522 --> 03:08:39,934
What do you mean best for him?

938
03:08:41,459 --> 03:08:43,234
It doesn't matter where he goes.

939
03:08:43,328 --> 03:08:47,333
Some day he'll be back
to reclaim everything he's lost!

940
03:08:48,066 --> 03:08:52,310
And when he does, people like you
will be standing in his path.

941
03:08:52,837 --> 03:08:57,013
As for me, I'll stake my life
on protecting him.

942
03:08:58,810 --> 03:09:00,790
Never forget that!

943
03:09:04,683 --> 03:09:07,061
Come back if you change your mind.

944
03:09:07,786 --> 03:09:09,163
I'll be waiting for you, too.

945
03:09:28,673 --> 03:09:30,812

946
03:09:48,560 --> 03:09:49,903

947
03:09:50,929 --> 03:09:52,374

948
03:10:05,176 --> 03:10:07,156

953
03:11:32,397 --> 03:11:34,240
Isn't it beautiful tonight?

954
03:11:35,166 --> 03:11:37,737
It's always beautiful.

955
03:11:55,186 --> 03:11:58,360
Ever been to the sea, Kozue?

956
03:12:01,726 --> 03:12:05,299
After I left to wander,

957
03:12:05,396 --> 03:12:08,240
I always stayed near the sea.

958
03:12:11,002 --> 03:12:14,074
Sitting on the sand,
looking at the sea...

959
03:12:15,807 --> 03:12:19,254
all else seems inconsequential.

960
03:12:23,815 --> 03:12:25,192
What do you think?

961
03:12:25,650 --> 03:12:27,926
Shall we go to the sea?

962
03:15:45,917 --> 03:15:47,555
He forgot this.

963
03:15:51,656 --> 03:15:53,636
