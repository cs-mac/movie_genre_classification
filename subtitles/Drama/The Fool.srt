1
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:40,625
You fuck, you broke it.

2
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,883
What the hell was that?

3
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,541
What was what?

4
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,585
I'm referring to the enormous
underwater explosion.

5
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:30,883
- Alfonz?
- What?

6
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:36,081
Do you have any idea what this is?

7
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,784
I would guess it is a piece of a plate
from Howard Johnson's.

8
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,393
Do you have any idea what this is, buddy?

9
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,721
This is it.

10
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:47,022
This is it, man, this is what
I've been looking for for eight years.

11
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:48,891
Eight years.

12
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,990
Huh?

13
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,656
Oh, good God. Oh, thank you.

14
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,733
Oh, baby, I knew you were here.
Oh, yes, you are.

15
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,962
Where's the boat?

16
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:01,330
- Where's the boat?
- I don't know.

17
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,632
What, did somebody just take it?

18
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,066
I found it.

19
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:16,973
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- It will come to you.

20
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,008
Oh, no.

21
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,650
For some reason,
I'm not entirely surprised.

22
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,842
Oh, no.

23
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,832
- Hey, guys.
- Get in.

24
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:10,266
- You wanna know where the boat went.
- It took us a minute to figure it out too.

25
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:13,167
- You sunk it.
- Listen, Curtis, forget the boat.

26
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,705
We found something.
I mean, we found something.

27
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:19,673
Big Bunny spent some major bank
on that leaky-ass piece of shit.

28
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:20,935
How come it sunk?

29
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,339
Look, boats sink.
I mean, nobody knows why.

30
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,808
Can I show you what I found?

31
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,105
- I think it was the compressor.
- Don't help me.

32
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,213
I want them to know it was you
who stole their money.

33
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,972
You didn't buy a new compressor?

34
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:35,882
- It's okay if I take off now?
- Yeah, man, we don't care about you.

35
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:39,451
Oh, you disloyal Ukrainian prick.

36
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,116
Ho! Ho! Ho! Easy.

37
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,484
Get in the damn boat.

38
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:00,625
Oh...

39
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:14,493
Oh...

40
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:18,705
What perfect hair.

41
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,897
What a perfect hairstyle.

42
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:25,371
Oh, my God, what perfect nails.
Where did you get them done?

43
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:29,772
You did them yourself? Oh, my God.

44
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:32,810
They're so incredibly perfect.

45
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,846
Like your incredibly perfect face,
and your...

46
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:41,211
...perfect personality.

47
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:45,077
Ugh. Ooh.

48
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:47,117
That's nice.

49
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:55,617
Lillian, I've called Teddy and Purdy...

50
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,986
...and they're not going to tell
their editors...

51
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,216
...not to publish stories about her.

52
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,860
It's how they make a living. Anyway...

53
00:08:04,028 --> 00:08:06,655
...what about the other half-dozen
bloody magazines...

54
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,820
...she's always appearing in
half-clothed...

55
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:11,487
...and halfway on her way
to the bloody halfway house?

56
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:12,757
Crush them too?

57
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:15,991
No, no, no, I assure you
that as soon as Gemma arrives...

58
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,760
...I have every intention of giving her
a very firm talking-to, and I...

59
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,326
Hello? Oh...

60
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,495
My ex-wife.

61
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,535
Yes, sir.

62
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,941
Was there something else, uh?

63
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,210
- Tess.
- I'm sorry. Tess, yes.

64
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,744
No, sir.

65
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:44,678
I just wanted to tell you how much
I appreciate you accommodating me.

66
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:47,247
How did I do that?

67
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:51,573
You know, by agreeing to stop
in Key West for my thing tomorrow.

68
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:53,679
Your thing?

69
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:57,521
Oh, yes, I remember.
Married, are you getting?

70
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,247
Oh, no.

71
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,181
Divorced.

72
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:04,990
Oh.

73
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,282
Your idea?

74
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,925
Yeah.

75
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,360
I don't mean to pry, just...

76
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,428
That's all right.
I'll tell you all about it sometime.

77
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,054
If you like.

78
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,122
Anyway, thanks again.

79
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,593
You're welcome.

80
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:37,069
I authorized $62,581.43 to fix that boat.

81
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:42,432
So where my money at?

82
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,237
Oh, God, I don't know, um...
It's all over.

83
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,605
All over where?

84
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,141
The world.

85
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:50,440
All over the world?

86
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,246
The Caribbean, mainly.

87
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,078
Hell, I was pretty much blown out...

88
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,948
...at just about every dive supplier
south of Key West.

89
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,014
- I don't believe this guy.
- Look.

90
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,818
I used the money
to pay off some old debts...

91
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:04,791
...which, if anything,
should reassure you.

92
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:09,363
Because now I owe you money,
and you know that I'm good for it.

93
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:11,500
Huh?

94
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,905
Now, can we talk about the plate?

95
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,137
Come on.

96
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,609
A plate from Howard Johnson's.

97
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,844
It is not a plate
from Howard Johnson's, man.

98
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:34,115
That's got half the Vangor family crest
stamped on the back of it.

99
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,555
And if you just let me get back
down to my boat...

100
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:38,991
...all right, before my books rot,
I'll prove it.

101
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,630
Shit look more to me
like half a Arby's logo or something.

102
00:10:44,635 --> 00:10:47,399
Look at the filigree scalloping on the rim.

103
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,201
Do you understand what this means?

104
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,876
Get his embezzling ass off my island.

105
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,254
Fine.

106
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,320
Can I have my shard back?

107
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:10,188
You ain't gonna need it.

108
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,229
So you do know what it means.

109
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:18,166
No, no, no, get...

110
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,828
You guys are making a big mistake.

111
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:27,339
<i>Bigg Bunny is never gonna find
the Aurelia without me.</i>

112
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:33,204
You ever hear the expression,
"miss by an inch, miss by a mile"?

113
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,081
It's a diving expression.

114
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:39,085
It means, you miss by an inch,
you miss by a mile.

115
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,652
Now, that wreck could be scattered
over 20 miles, guys.

116
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:46,627
Any last words?

117
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,369
Yeah.

118
00:11:58,474 --> 00:11:59,998
Tell Tess I love her.

119
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,837
Okay.

120
00:12:02,812 --> 00:12:03,836
Who's Tess?

121
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:06,142
It's my wife.

122
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:10,775
At least she will be
till 10:00 tomorrow morning.

123
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,550
She's divorcing me...

124
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,789
...and I still don't know what I did wrong.

125
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:24,260
Well, brother, you ain't never
gonna find out, neither.

126
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,061
- Let's go.
- Curtis, hold it, help.

127
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,966
Help. Help!

128
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,397
Oh, shit.

129
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:40,273
Hey.

130
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:45,086
Hey. Don't move.

131
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,797
Oh, shit.

132
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,369
Whoa. Whoa.

133
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:15,478
Get him.

134
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,517
Use the boat. Start the engine.

135
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:24,157
Oh, shit!

136
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,690
Whoo!

137
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,194
Shit.

138
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,950
Shit.

139
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:35,557
Please, Lord,
don't let me shoot off my foot.

140
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:14,862
Okay, guys...

141
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:16,594
...wish me luck.

142
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,966
Good luck, honey.
Don't lose your nerve at the last minute.

143
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:23,438
She don't need her nerve,
10-to-1 the guy don't even show up.

144
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:27,375
- Why do you say that?
- Because that's his nature.

145
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,605
- What the hell do you know?
- That's right.

146
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:32,410
Defend that bastard
and attack your friends who love you.

147
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:33,745
I've got no feelings.

148
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,616
I'm just saying you don't know
anything about my marriage.

149
00:15:36,789 --> 00:15:39,189
- Well, I heard enough.
- Hmm.

150
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,622
Do I comment on your love life?

151
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:45,786
You could, if I didn't happen to be
the most fortunate guy in the world.

152
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:47,555
Get out of here.

153
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:51,930
I just want you to have the happiness
me and Eddie thank God for every day.

154
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:54,401
He's not exaggerating, either.
We really do that.

155
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:57,097
Apparently this makes me
some kind of deranged animal.

156
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,835
You make it sound
like I never meant anything to him.

157
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:04,347
All I said was the guy has a tendency
to miss a lot of appointments.

158
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,179
Behold this dude.

159
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,905
What's up?

160
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:14,676
Oh, my God, are you from Cuba?

161
00:17:14,852 --> 00:17:18,253
Lucky for you we happened along,
my most superfluously toasted friend.

162
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,787
Water, water.

163
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,552
It appears that you have run dry
of the sacred nectar.

164
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:24,819
Oh, yeah.

165
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:29,154
Yeah.

166
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:34,396
All hail Neptune,
and those who party on his mighty waves.

167
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,937
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!
- Hail, Neptune. Whoo!

168
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,406
Decent rescue.

169
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,380
Holy shit.

170
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:59,725
Go faster. Whoo!

171
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,288
Take a left right here.

172
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:13,674
I'll give him a few more minutes,
Mr. McCintry...

173
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,611
...but if he's not here by a quarter past...

174
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,013
...I'll be forced to award everything
to Mrs. Finnegan here...

175
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,551
...by default.

176
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,383
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Do you wanna go to prison?

177
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,085
If it gets me out of Florida?

178
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:34,852
Honey, Florida didn't ruin your life.
You did.

179
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,559
You married a guy for the sex,
and then expected him to be smart.

180
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,003
Aah.

181
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,235
Maybe he had car trouble.

182
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,405
Car trouble?

183
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:51,012
<i>Yeah. You know...</i>

184
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,439
...car trouble.

185
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,911
He'd have to own a car...

186
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:01,982
...which he couldn't even if he wanted to
because he has no money.

187
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,955
<i>He has no credit.</i>

188
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,652
He has no clue how to behave
like a responsible adult.

189
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,287
Oh...

190
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:15,960
Which is why I can't get a loan,
because everything is in our name. Ha-ha.

191
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,635
I can't even pay for school
and finish my degree...

192
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,175
...which is what I was doing
in the first place...

193
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,745
...before I got dragged down here
on spring break.

194
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:31,111
But like you said, the sex was really...

195
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:34,554
...really, really great.

196
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:39,988
Do you have any idea
how humiliating it is...

197
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,062
...to get divorced by yourself?

198
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:58,112
Your Honor, this is a big mistake.

199
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,009
This woman...

200
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:03,415
...and I still love each other.

201
00:20:04,985 --> 00:20:06,748
Don't do this, Tess.

202
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,151
Look, I know I messed up, all right?

203
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,349
But I'm willing to change in any area
that you feel needs work.

204
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:13,959
I wanna make you happy.

205
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,226
I'll do anything.

206
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,861
I'll see a counselor.

207
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:27,865
Will you come to Chicago with me
like you promised?

208
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,040
Could be... I mean, that could work.

209
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:35,777
I'll definitely see the counselor.

210
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,954
Mr. Finnegan...

211
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:46,191
...I can't tell you what a pleasure it is
to inform you that under Florida law...

212
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:50,696
...you and this woman have been divorced
for the last 50 or 60 seconds.

213
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:54,857
Moreover, as you were not present
at the time of the proceedings...

214
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,629
...she got everything.

215
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,537
We're divorced?

216
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,779
I'm afraid so.

217
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:17,720
Why?

218
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,284
Excuse me.

219
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:35,073
Oh, wait, Tess.
I gotta tell you what happened.

220
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:37,267
Tess.

221
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,869
We found it. Me and Alfonz.

222
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:45,279
About a hundred yards off the reef.
Right where we always said she'd be.

223
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:49,116
Oh...

224
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,116
Prove it.

225
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,526
Excuse me, excuse me,
you have a pen, paper?

226
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:01,961
Anybody got a pen, pencil,
paper, anything?

227
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:04,433
Your uselessness is epic.

228
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:07,835
What does that mean? Here we go.

229
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:12,308
All right. Alfonz and I are diving...

230
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:17,048
...and I come across this plate,
dinner plate, about yay big.

231
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:19,183
It's plain white...

232
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:20,750
...but this...

233
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,848
...was stamped on the back...

234
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,554
...in blue.

235
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,557
It's the Vangor family crest, Tess.

236
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,062
You were right all along.
You were right before anybody.

237
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:38,836
- Where did you find this?
- A hundred yards off the reef.

238
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:43,397
Wow, Finn. Oh, my God.

239
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,406
That's what I'm saying.

240
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:47,572
Where's the plate?

241
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,039
Well, I don't have it on me
this minute.

242
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,574
Where do you have it?

243
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,685
Well, it's back there.

244
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:58,983
Wow.

245
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:01,683
Wow.

246
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,557
I know what you're thinking, Tess.
But I swear to God it's the truth.

247
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:06,755
You can ask Alfonz.

248
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,923
Okay. Where is he?

249
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:10,363
Well, he's back there too.

250
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:13,129
I can't believe you would dangle this
in front of me.

251
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,364
I can't believe it.

252
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,839
- You really think I'd lie about this?
- Why not? You're a liar.

253
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:21,341
But this is an inappropriate time
to dwell on that.

254
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,480
You... I can draw this picture too.

255
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:27,208
Hey, Tess, I'm telling you, we solved
a 300-year-old mystery yesterday.

256
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,545
Married or not...

257
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:32,314
...if we don't go after that ship,
it's gonna haunt us the rest of our lives.

258
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,822
I wasted eight years of my life
on this bullshit.

259
00:23:34,992 --> 00:23:37,654
I'm going back to Chicago.
I'm gonna get my Ph. D...

260
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:41,628
...and I'm going to spend the rest of my life
teaching, reading and writing books.

261
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,064
And somewhere in there I'm gonna meet
an intelligent, successful man...

262
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:50,173
...who can get through an entire
conversation without using "definitely."

263
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,170
First of all,
I hardly ever say that anymore.

264
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:00,706
And when are you gonna stop selling
this crap about going back to school?

265
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:04,218
You want history?
It's under the ocean, lady.

266
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:08,688
What, are you telling me you wanna
spend your life in some dark room...

267
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:11,259
...taking notes and writing books...

268
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:14,592
...about what some old putz in
another room cooked up in his head...

269
00:24:14,765 --> 00:24:17,199
...about things
that you have actually seen...

270
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:21,134
...and touched and pulled out of the sand
with your own hands?

271
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,037
Bullshit.

272
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:31,274
I'm so glad we're not married anymore.

273
00:24:37,454 --> 00:24:40,787
Well, where are you gonna get
the tuition money anyway?

274
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:44,120
That's the best part. By selling the boat.

275
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:48,359
By selling my boat, which belongs to me,
which used to belong to us...

276
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:50,999
...but you missed the divorce
so now it belongs to me.

277
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,628
I'm gonna fix it up, I'm gonna sell it,
and I'm going back... What?

278
00:24:54,804 --> 00:24:55,930
This is hard to say.

279
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:57,732
What is?

280
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:18,217
Well, you act like this is totally my fault.

281
00:25:19,162 --> 00:25:21,892
Can I borrow this cane
for a second, please?

282
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:23,794
Oh, come on, Tess.
You're not gonna hit me.

283
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,229
Ugh.

284
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:30,664
Sorry.

285
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,803
Oh, my God.

286
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:08,169
Oh, my God.

287
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:10,810
Oh, God.

288
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,898
I take it they didn't kill you.

289
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,278
No...

290
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:49,577
...but thanks for your help.

291
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:52,617
- You need help.
- You are not my mother.

292
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:53,811
You're right.

293
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,424
I guess maybe I act like your mother
sometimes because I never had one.

294
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:58,650
Easy, Gary, easy.

295
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,761
Okay, look, the main thing is
we get away from Key West.

296
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,763
The second Finn lays eyes on this boat,
he's gonna be on board in 10 minutes.

297
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:08,367
What do you mean?
You told him you're working here?

298
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,766
- Are you kidding?
- Then I don't get it.

299
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,432
He needs money, Gary.

300
00:27:13,641 --> 00:27:16,576
Another boat, new equipment, everything.

301
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:19,975
And I doubt he's gonna squeeze
another dime out of that Bugs Bunny.

302
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:23,344
- Bugs Bunny?
- The rapper guy we had the fight about.

303
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:25,314
- You mean Bigg Bunny Deenz?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:25,486 --> 00:27:28,284
- Bigg Bunny Deenz is Finn's investor?
- Yeah.

305
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:31,550
- Hey, Gary?
- He is a very dangerous guy.

306
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:34,092
I did like that one song he had,
"Call Me Thumper."

307
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,455
That was some funny shit.

308
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,928
- Anyway...
- There's something wrong with my bisque.

309
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:39,497
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Anyway...

310
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,396
But I don't get it,
because has Finn ever even met Nigel?

311
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,231
No. But he will, don't you understand?

312
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:48,101
He is a genius at exactly three things:

313
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:53,712
Treasure salving, finding money
for treasure salving, and one other thing.

314
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:57,616
- What other thing?
- What other thing?

315
00:27:59,352 --> 00:28:01,013
I don't wanna talk about it.

316
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,314
How do you plan to get another boat?

317
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,755
I can't think about this right now, Alfonz.

318
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:09,360
I just got divorced.

319
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,725
May I make a suggestion?

320
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,266
No.

321
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:19,001
You see that big yacht lying offshore?

322
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,663
No, which one?

323
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,673
The owner is Nigel Honeycutt.

324
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,570
- So what?
- I only mention it...

325
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:32,082
...because he is worth $ 700 million.

326
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,917
And just to let you know,
I'm back on board, obviously.

327
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,884
So whenever you want to weigh anchor
is great.

328
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,127
Thank you.

329
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:45,661
So should I tell the captain?

330
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,958
Ready to weigh anchor?
Ready to push off?

331
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,797
Actually, no.

332
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:54,097
My daughter, Gemma, is joining us today...

333
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,264
...and I said I would wait here for her.

334
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,910
Oh, great. God.

335
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:01,905
When is she coming?
Where is she coming from?

336
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:04,106
How far away is she? How great.

337
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:06,677
I sent the chopper to Miami...

338
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,787
...but she could be anywhere.

339
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:13,447
That's so funny that you would wait
in Key West for her...

340
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,355
...when she's coming by chopper.

341
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,587
- Is it?
- Well, just because the helicopter...

342
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:20,493
...could just meet the boat anywhere.

343
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:24,898
I mean, anywhere at all, that's what's
so incredibly great about helicopters.

344
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:28,429
She wants to do some shopping.

345
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:36,737
What do you do, Tess?

346
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:41,317
I'm the new steward.

347
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,318
But what do you really do?

348
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,755
What makes you think I do anything
besides stewarding?

349
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:53,124
Stewing, stewarding,
stewarding? Stewarding.

350
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:57,996
My infallible lifelong instinct
for sizing people up.

351
00:30:00,738 --> 00:30:02,103
Have you sized me up?

352
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:04,866
Not quite.

353
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:10,608
You don't mind the work,
but you're not here for long.

354
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:16,280
You have a deep but not entirely unclouded
love for the sea.

355
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:20,416
You perform your duties
with superlative efficiency and ease...

356
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,389
...suggestive of someone expending
approximately one-tenth...

357
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,426
...of her available brain power.

358
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:28,164
So...

359
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,730
...what do you do
with the remaining 90 percent...

360
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:33,837
...when you're not getting divorced?

361
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,671
I hope I'm not being too personal.

362
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:46,347
No, not at... Not at all.

363
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:53,647
It's just been a crazy couple of years.

364
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:59,160
It's probably his helicopter.

365
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,456
His daughter
is supposed to be arriving today.

366
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:04,361
The whole town is buzzing
with excitement.

367
00:31:22,886 --> 00:31:26,720
Hey, so where you say
this, uh, museum is at?

368
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:30,621
Number 2, Water Street.

369
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:34,321
Okay, uh, every street on this island
is called Water Street.

370
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:37,227
This place has a magic atmosphere.

371
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,368
Will you just find
the damn address, man?

372
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:42,061
Yo, Cordell, we got MapQuest
on these things?

373
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,612
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, darling.

374
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:31,118
Hello, my baby.

375
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:32,982
Daddy.

376
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:41,158
- Pleasant flight?
- Uh-huh.

377
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:45,098
So, um, is this the whole boat?

378
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:50,498
- Yes.
- Oh, so cute.

379
00:32:50,673 --> 00:32:53,005
I can't believe we're at sea.

380
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:56,338
Well, uh, technically, we're at anchor.

381
00:32:56,512 --> 00:33:02,450
Oh, wait, okay. So that just means
that the anchor is in the water, right?

382
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,648
- Yes.
- Yes.

383
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:08,220
Okay. Because I totally wanna learn
all the sea terms.

384
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:10,220
And so you shall, my darling.

385
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:13,622
Okay, let me try again.
Excuse me, Nigel.

386
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:16,161
Yes, my dear.

387
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,890
You know what,
let's not do the accent thing.

388
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,624
It's no good?

389
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:24,100
It's fine.

390
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,499
Um... Anyway...

391
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:31,509
Nigel, remember when you asked me
this afternoon what I really did?

392
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:47,190
Have fun shopping.

393
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:48,989
Thank you, Daddy.

394
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:51,631
Do try to keep it
under 50 thousand.

395
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,457
What? Ha.

396
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,463
Supper's at 7.

397
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:00,334
I was supposed to meet some friends,
but I'm gonna try to get out of it.

398
00:34:00,508 --> 00:34:02,772
Invite them aboard if you like.
Just let me know.

399
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:04,969
Okay, I will. Love you.

400
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:25,662
My hat.

401
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,841
Hey, look. The hat, he is a Frisbee.

402
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,171
Can you turn the boat around?
Thank you.

403
00:34:39,346 --> 00:34:41,974
Okay, but we never gonna catch him.

404
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,570
Whoa!

405
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:11,767
God.

406
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:17,382
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

407
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:22,413
Oh, my God. You killed him.

408
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,450
Ow. Ow. Ow.

409
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,256
What in God's name happened?

410
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:35,891
Daddy, this man saved my life.

411
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,729
Sir, sir...

412
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,264
...I really don't think you should get up
until I make sure...

413
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:53,444
Is this your hat?

414
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,280
Yes. Ha-ha.

415
00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:02,086
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

416
00:36:03,596 --> 00:36:07,930
Sir, thank you so much.

417
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,124
Thank you.

418
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,996
- Thank you, indeed.
- He'll be okay.

419
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,070
Just a little bump on the head.

420
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,799
Just try not to move around too much
for the next few hours.

421
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,639
- But I gotta go back to town.
- Oh, I really don't advise it.

422
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,207
Oh...

423
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,745
Now what am I gonna do?

424
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,709
Uh...

425
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:31,117
May I suggest a hot shower,
some clean clothes...

426
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,586
...and cocktails at 6:30?

427
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,354
Okay. Thanks.

428
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,029
Take him to the Saint Regis.

429
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,293
Whoa, whoa.
Yep, yep, yep, I'm good. I'm good.

430
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,197
Hey, Mr. Honeycutt?

431
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,037
Miss Honeycutt,
she leave him on the boat.

432
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,840
Gemma. Your lifeline
to civilization, darling.

433
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,075
Oh.

434
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,287
Oh, my God, I would have been so dead.

435
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,423
Here you are, darling.

436
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:18,558
Well, Mr. Deenz, I'm always delighted
to welcome an entrant into my field...

437
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,067
...whether it be on land or sea.

438
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:24,402
But I feel I need to warn you.

439
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,835
There's no way
of getting away from treasure...

440
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,672
...once it's fastened itself on your mind.

441
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:32,337
I want you to find me the Queen's Dowry.

442
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,847
Heh.

443
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,885
- Well, now, Bunny, uh...
- Bigg Bunny. It's one word.

444
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,018
Well, that's an emerald
of a different color, isn't it?

445
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,321
Cordell.

446
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,800
This is a piece of the plate
that we found in the Bahamas...

447
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,773
...off of Topsail Cay.
Now, if you turn it over...

448
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:03,401
...you may notice that it has
the Vangor family crest stamped on it.

449
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,514
That's what that is right there.

450
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,513
That's very nice, uh...

451
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,547
...but who the hell are the Vangors...

452
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:16,557
...and why the hell should I give
a rat's ass about their family crest?

453
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,398
It's not an investment, per se,
because you probably won't see a dime...

454
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,366
...but it's a chance to pull out
a piece of living history...

455
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:31,370
...from the sand
with your own two hands.

456
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:35,804
<i>To the Aurelia.</i>

457
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,749
Hey, babe.

458
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,678
What are you doing here?

459
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,444
Have a good dinner.

460
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:48,047
<i>Bon appétit, everybody.</i>

461
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:50,282
Ugh!

462
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:56,726
I take it you've met.

463
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,330
So Tess and I first hooked up when
we worked for this cat named Moe Fitch.

464
00:39:02,505 --> 00:39:06,271
He's kind of a local character, you know,
big talker, lot of tall tales...

465
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:07,841
...a lovable, old sea dog.

466
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,673
- You should live to be so eccentric.
- Ooh...

467
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:13,246
Thank you, babe.

468
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:15,316
I do wish you would sit down.

469
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:19,581
Moe Fitch is the most respected and
successful treasure salver in the world.

470
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,814
- Nobody said he wasn't.
- When Finn met Moe...

471
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,186
...he was repairing outboards
and lawn mowers...

472
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,828
...during the brief intervals
he wasn't getting fired.

473
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,896
Two times, Tess. I got fired two times.

474
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,929
I'll be off in one second.

475
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:34,301
Moe picked him out of a puddle
of motor oil and suntan lotion...

476
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:38,701
...gave him a job, a vocation,
taught him everything he knows.

477
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,570
Almost.

478
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,515
Anyway, then they had a tremendous
falling-out over this cannon we found...

479
00:39:47,682 --> 00:39:49,445
On our day off.

480
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:52,711
<i>From the Aurelia,
three miles east of Vero Beach.</i>

481
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:56,414
Which the court ruled was Moe's,
because we borrowed his equipment.

482
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:00,661
The sea is all attached, right?

483
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:02,826
To what, darling?

484
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:05,557
Kerry and Vivante
grabbed a plane for the Yucatân...

485
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:07,964
...and I thought
we could hook up with them...

486
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:11,003
...instead of just sailing around
doing nothing.

487
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,042
Tell us about the treasure.

488
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:24,975
July 31 st, 1715.

489
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:28,919
A hurricane sinks the entire Spanish
treasure fleet off the coast of Florida...

490
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,581
<i>...including her flagship, the Capitana...</i>

491
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,855
...which, according to its manifest,
carried the Queen's Dowry.

492
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:39,396
Forty chests
of jewelry and gold crowns...

493
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:42,592
...especially crafted in the Orient
for the new queen of Spain.

494
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,238
When we say jewels, we mean...

495
00:40:45,406 --> 00:40:51,311
...Indian diamonds, Burmese rubies and
Colombian emeralds the size of your fist.

496
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:55,312
We should probably start with what Tess
and I got excited about on our honeymoon.

497
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:57,541
Well, I think we can all guess.

498
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:01,578
After we lost the court case...

499
00:41:01,755 --> 00:41:04,485
...we decided to go backpacking in Spain
for two weeks.

500
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:09,556
Ended up spending two years
in the Archives of the indies in Seville.

501
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,925
You spent your honeymoon in a library?

502
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:13,628
<i>Okay.</i>

503
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:19,270
I love you.
Oh, baby, I love you too.

504
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,137
Where every known record,
official transcript and royal decree...

505
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,778
...relating to the fleets
has been kept for centuries.

506
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:29,177
<i>At first it was for fun, but then
we decided to look up the Aurelia...</i>

507
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:33,046
...because of the cannon we'd found in
Florida, and it became our pet project.

508
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,657
Especially when we learned the captain was
an 18-year-old kid named Sebastian Vangor.

509
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:40,588
Who we also discovered
was the illegitimate son...

510
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,196
<i>...of Captain General Don Juan Ubilla
of the Capitana...</i>

511
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:47,526
...and his Mexican mistress,
Francesca Vangor.

512
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,568
We thought it was an interesting sidebar
and really didn't think much more of it...

513
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:57,767
...until Tess found this very obscure
Spanish book published in 1905...

514
00:41:57,944 --> 00:42:01,436
<i>...titled, The vangors:
An 18th Century Family.</i>

515
00:42:01,614 --> 00:42:04,378
- It was a collection of letters.
- So why is this important?

516
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:08,987
Because the Vangors controlled
the mule train that transported the Dowry...

517
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:11,817
...over the mountains
from the Pacific to the Caribbean...

518
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:14,960
...and then loaded it onto Spanish galleons
here in Veracruz.

519
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:18,528
So I'm reading this, and all
of a sudden I start hyperventilating...

520
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:23,135
...because there it is right in front of me
in Ubilla's last letter to Francesca.

521
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:24,929
He wrote:

522
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:28,729
<i>"My faith in the Aurelia
is that she is swift and light...</i>

523
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,809
...and can outrun the storms
we will most certainly encounter.

524
00:42:31,978 --> 00:42:35,675
But it is my faith in Sebastian
that knows no bounds.

525
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:39,614
Our son is good and strong
and wiser than this old fool...

526
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:42,720
...who leaves your bed
more and more reluctantly.

527
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:48,622
"The glory of the Spanish Crown
rests in his capable hands."

528
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,319
So...

529
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,662
...Ubilla pulled a switch.

530
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,323
Mm.
With the Vangors' help.

531
00:42:57,068 --> 00:43:02,472
<i>And moved the Queen's Dowry
from the Capitana to the supply ship.</i>

532
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:03,665
Because?

533
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:06,003
<i>The Capitana
was already way overloaded...</i>

534
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:08,645
...so it was very heavy and very slow.

535
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:11,077
It wasn't just hurricanes
they had to worry about.

536
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:13,547
British warships,
French privateers, you name it.

537
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:17,119
About the time Finn and I were ready
to leave, we found this article...

538
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,918
...about a Spanish sailor
who was rescued off a deserted island...

539
00:43:21,092 --> 00:43:23,185
...after being shipwrecked for three years.

540
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:24,555
Off Topsail Cay?

541
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:27,960
- Right. 1718.
- Three years after the hurricane.

542
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:31,899
A Dutch frigate had come to grief
on the shoals off of Topsail Cay...

543
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,538
...and while waiting for the tide to rise...

544
00:43:34,706 --> 00:43:37,766
...they saw what they thought
was an old man paddling out on a log.

545
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:41,538
Only he wasn't an old man.
He was 21 years old.

546
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:44,739
Looked like Tom Hanks in that movie.
What was that movie?

547
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:45,940
Um...

548
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:49,043
<i>- Cast Away.
- Ha-ha.</i>

549
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,311
- Yes.
- Ha-ha.

550
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:54,253
He told the Dutch captain
his name was Raphael Serrano...

551
00:43:54,425 --> 00:43:56,916
<i>...of the tobacco ship Francesca.</i>

552
00:43:57,127 --> 00:43:59,527
Ha. As in mother of Sebastian.

553
00:43:59,697 --> 00:44:00,789
- Yes.
- Exactly.

554
00:44:01,398 --> 00:44:02,763
Now, he said...

555
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:06,425
...he had struck the same reef
and sunk in just 30 feet of water.

556
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:08,336
Wow.

557
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:10,473
You guys must really like treasure.

558
00:44:11,175 --> 00:44:14,633
Yes. I mean, it's very impressive...

559
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:17,679
...but it's still thin.

560
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:21,079
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Only Francesca...</i>

561
00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,910
...she didn't sink off Topsail Cay.

562
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,455
She sank off the coast of Veracruz
in 1708...

563
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:32,221
...with all hands,
including her captain, Raphael Serrano.

564
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:34,663
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Neither did we.

565
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:39,269
<i>Until we discovered the Francesca
had been owned by the Vangor family.</i>

566
00:44:41,038 --> 00:44:42,300
Yeah.

567
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:46,739
So, what do we know
about Sebastian Vangor?

568
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:53,240
Well, we know for a fact that
he survived a hurricane, a shipwreck...

569
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:57,409
...starvation, pirates, most likely,
and then he lied about it.

570
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:02,523
Now, why lie about being part
of the greatest treasure fleet in history?

571
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:06,360
Unless you're sitting on top
of a huge secret.

572
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:11,091
A secret that nobody, not even
the king of Spain, knew existed.

573
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:14,836
Well, I can think of only one reason:

574
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:17,301
Honor.

575
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:20,799
Because his father had entrusted him...

576
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:23,172
...with precious gifts
mankind had never seen...

577
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:27,783
...he had to survive
to fulfill the privilege...

578
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:30,646
...Ubilla had bestowed on him
that fateful day in Veracruz.

579
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,878
That's why he lied.

580
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:37,955
That's why he lived.

581
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,852
And that's why we can't give up.

582
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:49,165
Sebastian Vangor is the unsung hero
of an entire nation...

583
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:51,329
...and we intend to prove it.

584
00:45:51,974 --> 00:45:55,205
- So, what happened to him?
- Sebastian?

585
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,907
He was taken off the Dutch ship
in Martinique...

586
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:00,844
...and died a week later of consumption.
Oh...

587
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:02,540
He drank too much?

588
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:08,089
No. Um... Consumption, darling.
As in tuberculosis.

589
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:12,522
Not to be confused with consuming,
as in guzzling.

590
00:46:12,694 --> 00:46:15,663
Oh, man. I'm so dumb.

591
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:17,889
Huh. You wanna hear dumb?

592
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:23,026
I used to think that it meant he died
having sex, as in consummating.

593
00:46:23,805 --> 00:46:25,500
- You did?
- Yeah.

594
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:26,834
You did?

595
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,566
Yeah.

596
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,341
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

597
00:46:34,683 --> 00:46:38,346
Anyway, that's our idea.

598
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,012
It's Tess' mostly, she was always
the brains of the operation.

599
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:47,794
Well, Gemma? What do you think?

600
00:46:47,963 --> 00:46:49,590
You're asking me?

601
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,789
I am.

602
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:53,799
A treasure hunt in the Bahamas?

603
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:58,269
Or a month with Kerry and Vivante
in the Yucatân?

604
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:06,441
Will you teach me how to dive?

605
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:09,906
Yes, I will.

606
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:12,776
- Tess.
- Hey, Alfonz.

607
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:16,021
- Long time.
- This is Mr. Nigel Honeycutt. Alfonz.

608
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,589
Welcome aboard.

609
00:47:17,758 --> 00:47:19,658
This is Gemma Honeycutt. Alfonz.

610
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:21,727
Pleased to meet you.

611
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:39,973
Like that.

612
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:42,344
- There you go.
- Thank you.

613
00:47:42,817 --> 00:47:45,547
And... Whoa.

614
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,631
Okay. Okay.

615
00:48:10,276 --> 00:48:12,335
Now, the island is basically triangular.

616
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:15,106
You got cliffs and breakers,
harbor and town, and beach.

617
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:18,375
Now, I found the plate near the reef
just on the other side.

618
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,076
But you haven't got
the exact coordinates?

619
00:48:21,254 --> 00:48:23,779
The exact position
of the find is irrelevant.

620
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:27,188
- Why?
- We, uh, kind of left a marker.

621
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,329
We set the boat on fire,
and then we sank it.

622
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:33,363
- But we would never do that to your boat.
- Nope, just my boat.

623
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:34,830
- Our boat.
- My boat.

624
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:36,332
- Our boat.
- My boat.

625
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:41,496
Hey, did you know that this entire island
is owned by Bigg Bunny Deenz?

626
00:48:41,975 --> 00:48:44,535
- Who?
- He owns the whole island?

627
00:48:46,713 --> 00:48:49,204
Bigg Bunny Deenz.

628
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,179
Oh, yes, I remember.

629
00:48:51,351 --> 00:48:55,481
Didn't he murder someone
named Fuzzy Dice...

630
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,282
...or Pogo Stick or something?

631
00:48:57,457 --> 00:48:59,857
His name was Exta-C.

632
00:49:00,026 --> 00:49:01,584
You're really close.

633
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:03,228
And he was totally acquitted.

634
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:08,060
Well, it was difficult to secure a conviction
because he murdered all the witnesses.

635
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:10,668
You are really incredible, Finn.

636
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:14,636
Okay, so he owns the island. So what?
He doesn't own the water.

637
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:18,242
And how's he gonna feel when we're
hauling treasure up out of the water...

638
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:20,378
...in front of his beach house?

639
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:24,741
- Supportive?
- I told you not to get involved with him.

640
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:28,614
What if we need food or fuel
or flashlight batteries?

641
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:30,584
Will you relax, Tess?

642
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,849
<i>It's Aurelia.</i>

643
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:39,790
She's right around the corner,
and she's all ours.

644
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,772
Hey, guys.
Come look at this boat.

645
00:49:51,944 --> 00:49:57,405
It's got these really big, um, tubes
going in the water off the back.

646
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,459
Is that where you found the plate?

647
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:19,665
Man, oh, man.

648
00:50:19,837 --> 00:50:25,400
Anybody but me wanna spend
a weekend in Paris with that boat?

649
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:28,704
- I think she's already taken.
- What?

650
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,087
Oh, you son of a...

651
00:50:37,254 --> 00:50:38,278
Bitch.

652
00:50:38,456 --> 00:50:39,980
- What's the matter?
- It's Moe.

653
00:50:40,157 --> 00:50:41,624
- What?
- What is it?

654
00:50:45,363 --> 00:50:48,025
What's happened?
I'm pretty sure hell just froze over.

655
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:51,462
Well, don't that just beat all.

656
00:50:53,004 --> 00:50:55,768
<i>The Aurelia's mine, goddamn it.</i>

657
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,874
Not if I find her first.

658
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:02,602
Looks like he's only been here
a day or two.

659
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,476
- How can you tell?
- It's a full day's work to lay the grid.

660
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,583
But... So, what are they looking for?

661
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:10,277
Do you really not know
the answer to that?

662
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:16,955
Darling.

663
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:19,856
Huh.

664
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:21,760
Oh...

665
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:24,933
- I will go comfort her.
- No, you stay there.

666
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:26,728
I'm sorry, but she's gotta learn...

667
00:51:26,903 --> 00:51:29,895
...there's better ways to get attention
than acting like a bimbo.

668
00:51:30,073 --> 00:51:31,734
Like what?

669
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:00,733
Ahoy there. Good morning.

670
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:04,431
Morning to you.
That's quite a bucket you got there.

671
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:05,631
Hello, Moe.

672
00:52:07,677 --> 00:52:09,804
- Hey, darling.
- Small world, huh?

673
00:52:09,979 --> 00:52:12,038
Where's that good-for-nothing husband?

674
00:52:12,215 --> 00:52:14,581
- Ex-husband.
- Congratulations.

675
00:52:33,836 --> 00:52:35,895
Find anything yet, Mr. Fitch?

676
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:39,404
Well, sir, we're just gonna set
off some charges and take a look.

677
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:44,035
You might wanna ease back a ways just
in case we accidentally scratch your finish.

678
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:45,510
I'll tell the captain.

679
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:47,911
Let's blow some holes.

680
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:52,209
Come on.
I'm getting old, let's find some gold.

681
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:03,923
Oh, my God.

682
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,663
- What?
- Delay, delay.

683
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:08,666
Uh, excuse me, Moe?

684
00:53:09,338 --> 00:53:14,366
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the Ukrainian sidekick.

685
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:17,307
I don't think of myself that way.

686
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:21,779
I am the lead character in my own story.
Ha.

687
00:53:22,117 --> 00:53:26,713
But why does everyone I know think
I'm hot except the ones on this boat?

688
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:28,186
We think you're hot.

689
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:29,984
- Are you kidding me?
- I know I do.

690
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:32,354
Gemma. I need your help.
No time to explain.

691
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:36,361
What do you want?
Some expert advice on how to be stupid?

692
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:39,089
Oh...

693
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:42,168
Look. See how dumb they are?

694
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:45,297
Yeah.

695
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:49,000
They can't help it. You can. The end.

696
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:50,269
Let's go.

697
00:53:57,752 --> 00:53:59,242
- Okay.
- Okay, you're on.

698
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,944
- Okay.
- All right, go, go, go.

699
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,185
Hi.

700
00:54:06,561 --> 00:54:09,029
Hi. I'm Gemma.

701
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,401
- It's Gemma Honeycutt.
- Are you serious?

702
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:18,630
It's Gemma Honeycutt.

703
00:54:18,806 --> 00:54:22,902
- Hi. What are your names? Oh.
- I'm Happy.

704
00:54:23,077 --> 00:54:25,341
- I'm Jim.
- Hi.

705
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,606
- Hi.
- Petruchio, eh.

706
00:54:27,782 --> 00:54:30,683
So did you all grow up on this boat?

707
00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:34,077
- Oh! Oh, my God, there's Finn.
- Gemma.

708
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,723
Goddamn bastard. I'll get
that little shit out of there myself.

709
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,665
What, are you crazy, Moe?

710
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:53,328
Who the hell set off that charge?
There's a man down there.

711
00:54:53,506 --> 00:54:55,167
- What the hell?
- Right over here.

712
00:54:55,342 --> 00:54:57,401
He ripped up the grid.
Nobody rips the grid.

713
00:54:57,577 --> 00:55:00,205
Anybody gonna kill that boy,
it's gonna be me.

714
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,779
Okay.

715
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,328
Finn?

716
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:29,433
- Hey, honey.
- Ha-ha-ha!

717
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:32,373
- You go, girl.
- I'll be right over.

718
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:33,739
Hey.

719
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,780
Bravo. Bravo.

720
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,748
Oh, shit.

721
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:44,848
Oh, hello, Moe.

722
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:48,121
Hello, Finn. Anything broke?

723
00:55:48,994 --> 00:55:51,827
- I don't think so.
- Good.

724
00:55:53,632 --> 00:55:56,533
- Finn!
- Finn! Oh!

725
00:55:58,504 --> 00:56:00,165
Is that all you got, old man?

726
00:56:02,675 --> 00:56:05,974
It's difficult to maintain enthusiasm
for your leadership...

727
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:10,104
...when you keep getting beat up
by that old man.

728
00:56:10,282 --> 00:56:13,080
He's 56 years old.

729
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:14,513
I can't hit him.

730
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:16,951
That's quite obvious.

731
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,522
Was that a yellow and white
Cessna 206 seaplane?

732
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:31,033
I would describe it more
as banana and cream.

733
00:56:31,203 --> 00:56:35,196
I still can't get over the way
he just came up out of the water like that.

734
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:37,069
I know, and holding the sword.

735
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:39,574
And then he just makes
this totally perfect toss...

736
00:56:39,745 --> 00:56:42,407
...and the sword ends up sticking
straight up in the deck.

737
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:44,208
Amazing.

738
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:49,046
But it's more than just the sheer power
of his raw sexuality.

739
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,213
It's a totality of his emotional commitment
to the task at hand.

740
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:55,325
Yeah, it's the focus. It's the focus.

741
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:57,358
He sees it. He wants it.

742
00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:01,196
- He goes after it. He gets it.
- He sure got me.

743
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:02,890
Do you mind?

744
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:06,095
- I'm sorry.
- We're sorry.

745
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:12,873
Well...

746
00:57:13,044 --> 00:57:17,174
Here's to a wonderfully exciting first day...

747
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:21,307
...and to the safe landing
of our glorious leader.

748
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:26,180
Hear, says I. Hear, hear, Nigel.
You the man.

749
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,417
No, he meant you, stupid.

750
00:57:30,094 --> 00:57:31,118
What?

751
00:57:31,295 --> 00:57:33,763
- No, Finn, honey, Finn.
- Oh.

752
00:57:33,931 --> 00:57:36,832
There's port in the salon
if anyone's interested...

753
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,901
...and a wonderful selection of cigars...

754
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:42,528
...if anyone feels like
ruining the evening for the rest of us...

755
00:57:42,707 --> 00:57:44,004
...and cupcakes.

756
00:57:44,175 --> 00:57:45,733
Are there any prostitutes?

757
00:57:48,646 --> 00:57:50,841
Sorry. No.

758
00:57:51,015 --> 00:57:52,709
Well, maybe we can call some.

759
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:55,751
Oh. My God, are you serious?

760
00:57:56,753 --> 00:57:59,551
Pay him no attention, Gemma,
he's a provocateur.

761
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:03,454
Okay, but we're not in France right now,
we're in America.

762
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:10,157
- Think I'm gonna head to bed.
- That's it for me tonight.

763
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,566
A coincidence that we got up together,
and we're both going to bed...

764
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,401
...because we're not going
to bed together.

765
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:19,599
- Obviously.
- No.

766
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,971
Well, it's really none of our business.

767
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,045
Or even interesting.

768
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:26,045
- What she's trying to say...
- Good night.

769
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:27,649
Good night.

770
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:30,512
Good night.

771
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,583
Nigel, great day.
Gemma, sweet dreams.

772
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,427
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Tess.

773
00:58:48,138 --> 00:58:49,799
I hope...

774
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,736
I hope, Gemma...

775
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:58,035
...it hasn't been too dull for you here.

776
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:01,741
Of course not, Daddy.
It's been really fun.

777
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,578
Yes.

778
00:59:06,555 --> 00:59:08,045
Do you still play gin rummy?

779
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:10,749
Oh, my God, all the time.
Whenever I fly.

780
00:59:11,827 --> 00:59:13,795
Oh. Penny a point?

781
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,713
Hey, it's Tess.

782
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:43,155
Don't get the wrong idea,
I just, uh, wanna talk. Um...

783
00:59:43,726 --> 00:59:49,665
I just thought,
since I've been kind of critical recently...

784
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:55,193
...maybe I should tell you
how magnificent you were today...

785
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:58,465
...you know, taking out their grid and...

786
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:01,775
You couldn't hit Moe back.

787
01:00:02,176 --> 01:00:04,974
Uh, it just reminded me of how...

788
01:00:09,016 --> 01:00:10,779
Are you in here?

789
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:19,551
Oh.

790
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:29,068
Gin.

791
01:00:29,236 --> 01:00:30,931
What?

792
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:36,810
Hundred and five.

793
01:00:36,977 --> 01:00:39,070
Twenty-eight thousand.

794
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:43,981
- Dollars?
- Well, it's all going to charity, Daddy.

795
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:48,351
Well, darling, I'm very pleased
you've inherited...

796
01:00:48,522 --> 01:00:51,423
<i>...not only your mother's beauty
and na:? Ve charm...</i>

797
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:57,354
...but also her singular talent for
getting huge sums of money out of me...

798
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:59,795
...with a modicum of effort.

799
01:01:04,705 --> 01:01:05,797
What's wrong?

800
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:09,706
I don't want it.

801
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,970
I'm sorry. It was a joke.

802
01:01:16,616 --> 01:01:18,709
I mean, be honest...

803
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:23,379
...she didn't exactly marry me for love,
did she?

804
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:33,024
My mother...

805
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,364
...was a 24-year-old blackjack dealer
from Nebraska.

806
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:43,437
You had to tip her $500
just to have a drink with you.

807
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:47,136
You got married two weeks later
at the age of 175.

808
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:49,008
- 51 to be precise.
- Now you're mad...

809
01:01:49,182 --> 01:01:52,413
...because she had the brains to get
some money before you dumped her?

810
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:54,018
No, I'm mad about the amount.

811
01:01:54,187 --> 01:01:57,679
Oh, well, okay, you can have mine.
Because I'm cutting myself off.

812
01:01:57,857 --> 01:02:01,088
I don't want anything from you anymore.

813
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:05,297
Except for food. And clothes.

814
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:09,329
And rent and, like, travel.

815
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:11,662
And I'm totally serious.

816
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:18,434
Yes, that's what is so frightening
about it.

817
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:22,840
Gemma?

818
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:28,747
For what it's worth...

819
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:32,679
...I loved your mother, and I love you.

820
01:03:17,735 --> 01:03:20,533
You believe in ghosts, Curtis?

821
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:25,669
You know what,
you are some kind of stupid.

822
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:28,334
Now you sound like my wife.

823
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:29,809
Bunny around?

824
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,508
You know, I can't hear you,
you talking to my deaf ear.

825
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:36,448
Oh, sorry.

826
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:43,417
Curtis?

827
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,107
Take me to see Bigg Bunny.

828
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:04,805
Bigg Bunny ain't never wanna find out
you didn't drown the first time.

829
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,481
Okay.

830
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:10,843
Shit.

831
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:15,657
When's the last time
you had this thing sharpened?

832
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,259
1715.

833
01:04:22,665 --> 01:04:24,462
Okay, okay, okay, one second.

834
01:04:24,867 --> 01:04:29,566
Now look, 20 people saw me today,
everybody on Moe's boat.

835
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:32,367
Now if you guys take me to Bigg Bunny...

836
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:36,638
...it's gonna look a lot better than if
he finds out I'm alive from someone else.

837
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,511
- It ain't his decision no more.
- Now, who in the hell are you?

838
01:04:50,693 --> 01:04:52,354
Ow.

839
01:04:52,795 --> 01:04:55,389
Ain't no fool like a gold fool.

840
01:04:55,565 --> 01:04:57,760
Ain't that right, Mr. Finnegan?

841
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:00,963
Who's the new guy?

842
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,968
This here is Cyrus.
He's my new, uh, chief of staff.

843
01:05:07,043 --> 01:05:09,978
He's helping me to refocus, reform,
and renew.

844
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,116
What do you need him for, huh?
We handling it.

845
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:19,378
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

846
01:05:19,555 --> 01:05:22,319
God, jeez. What's the...?

847
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:24,391
Why'd you do that?

848
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,322
Just a little restructure.

849
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:31,059
See, you let this boy get past
you not just once, but twice.

850
01:05:31,233 --> 01:05:32,495
So I hope you focused now.

851
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,431
Oh, extremely focused. Very motivated.

852
01:05:35,604 --> 01:05:39,438
My morale probably 20 percent higher
than when I came in here.

853
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:41,803
- Can I get a word in?
- What? What do you want?

854
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:45,176
I wanna buy some time.

855
01:05:46,248 --> 01:05:48,239
You still breathing, ain't you?

856
01:05:49,718 --> 01:05:51,151
Yeah, thank you.

857
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,778
Now, hear me out.

858
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:57,450
All right, the way I see it, you bet
on Moe, you got a fifty-fifty chance...

859
01:05:57,626 --> 01:06:02,120
...but you bet on the both of us, and we
cover twice the ground in half the time...

860
01:06:02,297 --> 01:06:07,735
...and I'm willing to give you 10 percent
of everything I find.

861
01:06:08,503 --> 01:06:11,438
Plus what I already owe you, of course.

862
01:06:12,274 --> 01:06:14,174
How much you say?

863
01:06:14,342 --> 01:06:16,936
Ten percent, across-the-board.

864
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:18,477
Ten percent, huh?

865
01:06:18,814 --> 01:06:20,475
Wow.

866
01:06:21,283 --> 01:06:23,843
- Say it again.
- Come on, what...?

867
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:25,418
You know, 12 percent's cool.

868
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,181
You know, I couldn't even hear you.
What you say?

869
01:06:28,356 --> 01:06:31,381
- Fifteen percent, but I gotta find...
- I'm sorry, how much?

870
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,528
- Eighteen, but I owe other people.
- That don't sound right.

871
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:37,095
- Twenty percent, but that's it, final.
- Oh.

872
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:39,095
Damn it. What? How much do you want?

873
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:41,798
I'll tell you what.

874
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,400
You find the treasure and I won't kill you.

875
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:07,650
- How much do you owe him?
- Whoa.

876
01:07:08,729 --> 01:07:10,720
Jesus, Tess.

877
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:12,958
How much do you owe him?

878
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:19,439
Owe who? Owe who what?

879
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,000
Bigg Bunny.

880
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:23,476
I don't owe him any money.

881
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:27,136
Finn, how much do you owe him?

882
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:30,240
Just tell me so I'll know.

883
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:33,818
Oh, God, Tess. I mean, that's so hard
to be specific about.

884
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:36,455
- It's a really complex payment schedule...
- How much?

885
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:41,287
Sixty-two thousand, five hundred and
eighty-one dollars and forty-three cents.

886
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:44,625
But we're good now.

887
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:47,830
Is there a reason
you didn't tell me this before?

888
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:50,525
Yeah.

889
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:55,036
You wouldn't have come.

890
01:07:56,776 --> 01:07:58,403
Yeah, I would.

891
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:03,576
Just wouldn't have come with you.

892
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:14,550
Are we finished?

893
01:08:18,631 --> 01:08:20,462
We sure are.

894
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,473
- You good?
- Yeah.

895
01:08:34,647 --> 01:08:36,274
Okay.

896
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,150
What happened to your face?

897
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:42,686
Somebody hit me with a cricket bat.

898
01:08:42,888 --> 01:08:44,253
Ah.

899
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:49,053
- This is a new type of regulator...
- Shove it up your ass.

900
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:51,491
- All right, we're good to go.
- Ready, darling?

901
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,528
Drop dead.

902
01:08:54,466 --> 01:08:56,957
This is just like the old days, huh?

903
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,096
Hello, darling.

904
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,994
Drink?

905
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,371
I have one.

906
01:10:46,277 --> 01:10:48,108
You know what else
is really bugging me?

907
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,243
No.

908
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,645
Please, tell us. Because I may personally
drop dead from disappointment...

909
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:59,016
...if I don't find out the 700-millionth thing
about life on planet Earth...

910
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:00,850
...that is bugging you.

911
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,789
Well, this is fun.

912
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,392
No, listen.

913
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:08,589
If I am the Dutch frigate
stuck on a reef in a dead calm...

914
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,825
<i>...in the same cove
the Aurelia sank three years earlier...</i>

915
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:16,199
...in less than 30 feet
of the clearest water in the world...

916
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:20,975
Then how come I can't see her?

917
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,173
Because she isn't there.

918
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:30,745
Yeah, I don't know.

919
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,879
No, no, no. Sebastian specifically said
that's where she sank.

920
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:36,889
- And he said it.
- Yeah.

921
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,326
My dear children, your entire theory
is predicated on the proposition...

922
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:46,265
...that Sebastian lied about everything he
could to prevent the ship being found.

923
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:50,566
So why on Earth would
he tell the truth about where she sank?

924
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:54,770
<i>I mean, it seems to me that
the Aurelia can't be in the cove...</i>

925
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,379
...for the simple reason that
that's where Sebastian said she was.

926
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:14,988
Sorry to disturb.

927
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,860
We've had to move to the lee side
on account of the storm.

928
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,058
She won't fit in the marina?

929
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:23,864
Afraid not. A taxi will take you
to the beach on the north end.

930
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,031
- Call, we'll pick you up on the launch.
- Better safe than sorry.

931
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:28,642
Sir.

932
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:32,245
I've grown rather fond of not sinking.

933
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:34,472
Ugh. Don't even say that.

934
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,585
Oh, it would be a shame
to lose the art collection.

935
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,944
Or Gemma's shoes.

936
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:43,484
Especially because we're so close
to shore, you know?

937
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,421
Oh, my God.

938
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,799
What?

939
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,429
Oh, my God, of course.

940
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:55,263
Of course what?

941
01:12:57,472 --> 01:12:59,996
You are a genius.

942
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:03,003
Stefan.

943
01:13:03,444 --> 01:13:05,537
- Stefan.
- Yes.

944
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,474
Why did you pick the north beach?

945
01:13:08,983 --> 01:13:12,111
I didn't. It's the only beach on the
island not blocked by the reef.

946
01:13:12,887 --> 01:13:16,015
Yes. Yes. He ran her aground.

947
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,851
What are you so happy about?

948
01:13:18,025 --> 01:13:20,550
- He ran her aground.
- What?

949
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:26,428
To save the Dowry. Sebastian ran
the whole goddamn thing aground.

950
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:31,193
Bet you $ 1000 I find something
between here and that beach.

951
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:33,101
You don't have $ 1000.

952
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:34,933
Fine, make it 10.

953
01:13:35,509 --> 01:13:36,976
You don't have $ 10.

954
01:13:37,745 --> 01:13:39,804
Fine, make it a million.

955
01:13:46,053 --> 01:13:47,611
What are you doing?

956
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:50,621
You think I'm letting you go out
there alone, you're crazy.

957
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,448
What, you don't trust me?

958
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:55,187
Why on Earth would I trust you?

959
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,221
Huh.

960
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:17,406
- I found a cannon.
- I found a cannon.

961
01:15:17,576 --> 01:15:19,237
- You did what?
- You mean there's two?

962
01:15:19,411 --> 01:15:20,901
- There's two cannons.
- Aah!

963
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:23,947
- And I owe you a million dollars. Aah!
- Yes, you do. Oh!

964
01:15:24,116 --> 01:15:25,549
Whoo!

965
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:27,816
<i>We got the Aurelia, baby!</i>

966
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:32,481
Listen to me, if anybody finds out about
this outside of our crew, we are screwed.

967
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,252
Wow. Can't you just enjoy this
for a second?

968
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:38,520
Oh, I'm enjoying it.

969
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,564
Oh, God. Thank God.

970
01:15:49,208 --> 01:15:51,642
Whoo-hoo!

971
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:20,167
Well, there's not much here.

972
01:16:20,338 --> 01:16:24,274
Now, they probably burned the ship
and took everything inland.

973
01:16:24,442 --> 01:16:27,900
Look, a pistol.
Cool.

974
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,412
All right, well, what do we know
about Topsail Cay?

975
01:16:31,816 --> 01:16:34,148
We got the town, the church...

976
01:16:34,318 --> 01:16:35,444
There's Preacher's Cave.

977
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,646
We were up there once.
It said something about first settlers...

978
01:16:38,823 --> 01:16:39,847
...religious freedom...

979
01:16:40,024 --> 01:16:42,549
God, I think that is just so important.

980
01:16:44,262 --> 01:16:45,559
Yeah, but that was like...

981
01:16:46,464 --> 01:16:49,956
- Oh.
- Like 1780-something.

982
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:54,367
I mean, Sebastian beat them here
by almost 70 years.

983
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:56,734
If there are any records,
they're in the church.

984
01:16:56,908 --> 01:17:00,139
- Letters, journals, sermons.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
01:17:01,479 --> 01:17:03,606
That's smart, Tess.

986
01:17:04,382 --> 01:17:06,816
It's the oldest building on the island.

987
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,118
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

988
01:17:18,228 --> 01:17:19,923
When Moe finds out we're gone...

989
01:17:20,097 --> 01:17:22,565
...he's gonna come barreling up
your ass like a freight train.

990
01:17:22,732 --> 01:17:24,962
Oh, my, that ought to be interesting.

991
01:17:25,135 --> 01:17:28,002
Well, I'm just saying
we don't have much time.

992
01:17:28,638 --> 01:17:29,696
Oh, my God.

993
01:17:30,474 --> 01:17:31,498
Stop the boat!

994
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:35,702
I just figured it out. It's been
right in front of us this whole time.

995
01:17:35,879 --> 01:17:37,005
What?

996
01:17:37,614 --> 01:17:39,844
<i>Precious Gem.</i>

997
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:41,708
Yes.

998
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:47,919
Well, do you realize how incredibly similar
the word "gem" is to "Gemma"?

999
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:51,525
Uh... I thought I did.

1000
01:17:51,695 --> 01:17:53,094
My God.

1001
01:17:53,263 --> 01:17:56,960
Daddy, you named the boat after me
and didn't even know it.

1002
01:17:58,535 --> 01:17:59,661
I didn't?

1003
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:01,896
Don't you see?

1004
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:09,478
You were running away to sea,
only you wanted to bring me along.

1005
01:18:09,646 --> 01:18:12,774
So you unconsciously
named the boat after me.

1006
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:18,154
That is so beautiful.

1007
01:18:24,393 --> 01:18:27,157
Of course I named it for you, Gemma.

1008
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:33,499
But it wasn't unconscious.
I gave it a lot of thought.

1009
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:37,503
No. You did it unconsciously.

1010
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:42,669
And then I did it unconsciously.

1011
01:19:07,703 --> 01:19:09,295
Good afternoon.

1012
01:19:09,471 --> 01:19:11,530
Afternoon. May I help you?

1013
01:19:11,707 --> 01:19:14,335
- I hope so. I'm Finnegan.
- Nice to meet you.

1014
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,704
- Tess.
- Tess.

1015
01:19:29,691 --> 01:19:31,215
Don't even think about it.

1016
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:35,053
- What?
- Don't "what" me. You know what.

1017
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:39,428
It's weird, right?

1018
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:44,065
- What?
- This.

1019
01:19:44,706 --> 01:19:46,333
Us, together.

1020
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:50,575
It's complex, but not in a good way.

1021
01:19:55,483 --> 01:19:59,544
Well, can I just say
I really wish we were still married?

1022
01:20:04,692 --> 01:20:06,216
No.

1023
01:20:15,103 --> 01:20:16,536
Oh, my God, listen to this.

1024
01:20:16,704 --> 01:20:19,571
Listen. "That we are by no means...

1025
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:21,834
...the first Europeans to visit here...

1026
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:25,537
...is finally proven
by the discovery of a Spanish gravestone...

1027
01:20:25,713 --> 01:20:27,271
...that of a woman.

1028
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,643
I cannot but wonder who she was...

1029
01:20:29,817 --> 01:20:33,081
...and how she came to die here,
for the headstone reads simply...

1030
01:20:33,253 --> 01:20:35,483
...'Aurelia, 1715."'

1031
01:20:35,656 --> 01:20:37,055
Holy shit.

1032
01:20:37,224 --> 01:20:40,716
"Forsake her I could not."

1033
01:20:40,894 --> 01:20:44,352
And so it was here,
on this beautiful hilltop...

1034
01:20:44,531 --> 01:20:47,989
...that I resolved to bury our own dead...

1035
01:20:48,168 --> 01:20:52,161
"...and begin work building a church."

1036
01:20:53,273 --> 01:20:55,537
He marked it with a headstone.

1037
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:58,200
And this guy built a church around it.

1038
01:20:58,378 --> 01:21:00,812
- It's in the cemetery.
- It's in the cemetery.

1039
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,082
- Finn.
- Mm-hm.

1040
01:21:09,756 --> 01:21:11,246
Oh...

1041
01:21:12,459 --> 01:21:14,427
- No, come on.
- Here we go.

1042
01:21:14,594 --> 01:21:16,118
Oh, shit, I got you.

1043
01:21:18,699 --> 01:21:20,360
Mm-hm.

1044
01:21:33,613 --> 01:21:35,342
Anything?

1045
01:21:36,615 --> 01:21:38,549
It's not here.

1046
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:41,276
I refuse to believe that.

1047
01:21:41,787 --> 01:21:46,884
Well, just because you refuse to
believe something doesn't make it true.

1048
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:48,754
Or false.

1049
01:21:49,628 --> 01:21:52,153
Or whatever the hell I'm saying.

1050
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:53,355
Something wrong, Tess?

1051
01:21:53,532 --> 01:21:56,399
Something wrong?
Why would anything be wrong?

1052
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:59,197
We just had sex in a church
and we're not even married...

1053
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,306
...and now we're gonna dig up a grave.

1054
01:22:01,474 --> 01:22:03,169
What is that, like a triple sin?

1055
01:22:03,342 --> 01:22:05,742
I can't believe we haven't been
struck by lightning. Oh!

1056
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:08,577
- Ow.
- Oh, shit, you okay?

1057
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:11,945
Stupid rock.
That's the second time I've done that.

1058
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:13,449
Okay, we can't have that.

1059
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:15,985
Come here, you rock. Stupid rock.

1060
01:22:22,161 --> 01:22:23,526
Wait, stop.

1061
01:22:23,696 --> 01:22:25,891
Oh... Honey, it's heavy.

1062
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:30,431
So is this.

1063
01:22:56,895 --> 01:22:58,522
Finn? Finn?

1064
01:23:00,365 --> 01:23:01,389
Finn.

1065
01:23:01,566 --> 01:23:03,158
- What?
- What if it's a body?

1066
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:10,071
Well, then he was a midget
with very cheap relatives.

1067
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:16,035
- What if it's a head?
- Do you mind?

1068
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:01,624
Oh, my God.

1069
01:24:05,229 --> 01:24:06,594
It's his.

1070
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:09,461
"To my everlasting relief..."

1071
01:24:09,633 --> 01:24:13,262
...and after a year's toil
in this lonely place...

1072
01:24:13,437 --> 01:24:17,635
...have I finally stumbled upon
a suitable place...

1073
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:19,799
...for my cargo...

1074
01:24:19,977 --> 01:24:24,141
...fortified by nature
against the encroachments...

1075
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:25,747
...accidental or deliberate...

1076
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:31,115
...even of those who would force
our tongues to betray its trust.

1077
01:24:32,089 --> 01:24:37,618
The low December tide showed us
the only way in and the only way out.

1078
01:24:37,794 --> 01:24:39,557
But from January to November...

1079
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:43,928
...the beached whale's spout
is both ingress or egress.

1080
01:24:44,101 --> 01:24:48,162
"Thus is the vault rendered,
made virtually impenetrable."

1081
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:52,501
The beached whale's spout?
Are you sure?

1082
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:58,874
Yeah.

1083
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:04,842
It's a blowhole.

1084
01:25:06,889 --> 01:25:08,288
It's the one at Clifton Point.

1085
01:25:08,457 --> 01:25:12,553
- The low December tide drops so low...
- The winter solstice.

1086
01:25:12,728 --> 01:25:15,856
The lowest tide of the year
exposes the mouth of the blowhole...

1087
01:25:16,032 --> 01:25:19,490
...which is normally
under 15 to 20 feet of water.

1088
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:22,164
Two days out of the year it's a cave.

1089
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:25,800
They float the chests in, the tide returns...

1090
01:25:25,975 --> 01:25:28,273
...then the place becomes a deathtrap.

1091
01:25:30,379 --> 01:25:33,007
Did we just find our treasure?

1092
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:36,212
Sound like it.

1093
01:25:38,054 --> 01:25:39,749
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Finnegan.

1094
01:25:40,356 --> 01:25:41,914
Hey, Bunny.

1095
01:25:42,091 --> 01:25:43,991
What the hell are you doing here?

1096
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,287
- Give me the book.
- Come on, Bunny.

1097
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:51,764
I mean, are you sure you don't wanna,
you know, give it to the new guy?

1098
01:25:58,373 --> 01:26:00,432
What you think you're gonna
do with that, huh?

1099
01:26:03,178 --> 01:26:05,772
Hey, you better put the damn shovel...

1100
01:26:09,384 --> 01:26:12,285
Hey, hey, hey, look, you know,
I don't want no trouble.

1101
01:26:12,454 --> 01:26:13,546
Get me out the hole!

1102
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:19,251
Get him, baby, get him.

1103
01:26:27,769 --> 01:26:29,202
Finn!

1104
01:26:31,172 --> 01:26:33,436
Where you...? What you...? Grab him.

1105
01:26:37,612 --> 01:26:38,977
Come on.

1106
01:26:41,683 --> 01:26:43,173
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1107
01:26:43,351 --> 01:26:44,409
Come on, go, go, go.

1108
01:26:45,587 --> 01:26:47,578
Hey. Hey...

1109
01:26:51,926 --> 01:26:53,416
Get after them, damn it.

1110
01:26:55,497 --> 01:26:56,521
Hang on.

1111
01:26:56,698 --> 01:26:59,462
Cyrus, my bike. Hey, you.

1112
01:27:01,168 --> 01:27:02,192
Are you shot?

1113
01:27:03,504 --> 01:27:05,631
- What?
- Shot? You?

1114
01:27:05,806 --> 01:27:09,333
- No. Are you shot?
- No, not yet.

1115
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:12,669
We got the book, Cyrus.

1116
01:27:12,846 --> 01:27:14,245
Finn!

1117
01:27:14,415 --> 01:27:15,439
I got you, Tess!

1118
01:27:15,949 --> 01:27:19,476
- Duck!
- What? Ugh!

1119
01:27:20,554 --> 01:27:22,385
- Finn!
- Uh-oh.

1120
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,126
Finn. No.

1121
01:27:32,066 --> 01:27:35,832
No. Finn. Oh, my...

1122
01:27:42,309 --> 01:27:44,140
Finn.

1123
01:27:45,913 --> 01:27:47,540
Let's go.

1124
01:27:58,058 --> 01:28:01,357
You sure he's dead? I've been
disappointed a lot of times before.

1125
01:28:01,528 --> 01:28:04,725
I should've aimed at your head,
you little son of a bitch.

1126
01:28:05,099 --> 01:28:06,565
I'm gonna tell you what.

1127
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:10,066
I'm gonna have my boys submit your theory
to a little academic review...

1128
01:28:10,236 --> 01:28:12,500
...while I go sit my balls on some ice.

1129
01:28:36,729 --> 01:28:39,459
After this wave,
you've got about 50 seconds.

1130
01:28:44,504 --> 01:28:45,994
Would you just get in the hole?

1131
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:48,669
Whoa! Whoo!

1132
01:28:55,948 --> 01:28:57,415
I can't.

1133
01:28:57,617 --> 01:28:58,777
Uh...

1134
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:00,509
Excuse me, Curtis.

1135
01:29:00,953 --> 01:29:02,887
Get in the hole.

1136
01:29:03,556 --> 01:29:07,253
Damn, Cyrus.
Why you always in my business, huh?

1137
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:09,792
I'm handling this shit.

1138
01:29:16,802 --> 01:29:18,633
You know what? You run it.

1139
01:29:20,872 --> 01:29:22,362
You run it.

1140
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:43,749
It's not here.

1141
01:29:43,928 --> 01:29:45,951
Check underwater.

1142
01:29:47,727 --> 01:29:49,387
There's nothing but rock.

1143
01:29:49,562 --> 01:29:51,153
I'm supposed to believe you, am I?

1144
01:29:51,329 --> 01:29:56,024
You want a second opinion, come on down.
Get me out of here.

1145
01:29:56,197 --> 01:29:57,423
Please.

1146
01:29:57,629 --> 01:29:59,095
Pull her up, man.

1147
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:03,854
Hey.

1148
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,997
Say hi to your husband.

1149
01:30:06,164 --> 01:30:07,391
What? No.

1150
01:30:07,565 --> 01:30:09,088
What the hell are you doing, man?

1151
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:10,753
Oh, God.

1152
01:30:17,767 --> 01:30:19,596
Throw me the rope.

1153
01:31:47,516 --> 01:31:48,607
Whoo!

1154
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:51,681
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1155
01:32:00,184 --> 01:32:01,309
<i>Talk to me.</i>

1156
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:03,348
It's here. Bring the tanks.

1157
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,751
We're gonna have to go in
through the ocean.

1158
01:32:06,919 --> 01:32:08,010
<i>And the girl?</i>

1159
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,345
Uh...

1160
01:32:10,753 --> 01:32:12,150
She won't need one.

1161
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:33,513
This better be good.

1162
01:32:33,691 --> 01:32:36,623
Moe, it's Finn. It's bad, it's real bad.

1163
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:38,621
<i>- They got Tess.
- What?</i>

1164
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:41,155
The treasure's in the blowhole
at Clifton Point.

1165
01:32:41,325 --> 01:32:42,348
They took her hostage.

1166
01:33:03,696 --> 01:33:07,652
That is one big-ass,
sensible-sized emerald.

1167
01:33:10,797 --> 01:33:13,263
Sure, go have fun.
Go get yourselves killed.

1168
01:33:13,431 --> 01:33:15,624
Go pump some lead in your fellow man.
Go ahead.

1169
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:16,821
What a sissy.

1170
01:33:16,998 --> 01:33:18,987
He is more man
than you'll ever be, honey.

1171
01:33:19,165 --> 01:33:20,631
Hey. You ladies wanna move out?

1172
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:23,824
They could have killed
a whole graduation class by now.

1173
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,556
Daddy.

1174
01:33:26,466 --> 01:33:29,558
- I'm scared.
- She's going to be all right.

1175
01:33:29,733 --> 01:33:32,598
- I promise.
- I'm worried about you.

1176
01:33:33,934 --> 01:33:36,127
Oh, bless you for that.

1177
01:33:37,268 --> 01:33:38,598
I'll see you at breakfast.

1178
01:34:22,243 --> 01:34:25,607
Hey! Hey!

1179
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:28,998
Goddamn.

1180
01:34:29,177 --> 01:34:31,371
How many times am I gonna
have to kill this boy?

1181
01:34:39,012 --> 01:34:40,638
Shit.

1182
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:46,873
Oh, shit.

1183
01:34:50,314 --> 01:34:52,177
Somebody help.

1184
01:34:54,148 --> 01:34:55,307
Tess!

1185
01:34:56,048 --> 01:34:57,674
Finn?

1186
01:34:58,849 --> 01:35:00,145
Finn!

1187
01:35:11,218 --> 01:35:12,808
Shit.

1188
01:35:46,957 --> 01:35:49,924
Whoo. There's a whole lot more
where this came from.

1189
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:07,556
- Where's Cyrus?
- He said he'd be right up.

1190
01:36:12,896 --> 01:36:14,555
Mm.

1191
01:36:17,863 --> 01:36:18,886
Ugh.

1192
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:24,388
Find out who that was.

1193
01:36:24,597 --> 01:36:26,620
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1194
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:37,908
Oh, my God.

1195
01:37:38,777 --> 01:37:39,834
Shit.

1196
01:37:41,011 --> 01:37:42,170
Cover me.

1197
01:37:42,344 --> 01:37:43,571
Where you going?

1198
01:37:43,745 --> 01:37:45,938
Where's he going? Wait.
Where are you going?

1199
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:47,237
Shit, man.

1200
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:57,174
Aah!

1201
01:37:58,347 --> 01:38:00,609
You son of a bitch.

1202
01:38:00,981 --> 01:38:02,277
Uh-oh.

1203
01:38:21,184 --> 01:38:24,480
Here, cock it. Cock it.

1204
01:38:25,451 --> 01:38:27,974
I can't make it cock.

1205
01:38:34,387 --> 01:38:35,978
No, no, no.

1206
01:38:46,555 --> 01:38:48,283
Give that to me.

1207
01:38:51,924 --> 01:38:54,856
- You okay, Moe?
- Yeah, great.

1208
01:38:55,024 --> 01:38:58,218
- Get in the plane. Get...
- No. Aah!

1209
01:39:00,058 --> 01:39:02,923
- No.
- Get your hands off her.

1210
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:10,751
Get in the plane.

1211
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:27,226
Sit back.

1212
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:32,320
Get your hands... Sit back now.
Sit back now.

1213
01:39:33,764 --> 01:39:35,355
Shit.

1214
01:39:59,902 --> 01:40:02,424
Gemma. No.

1215
01:40:06,436 --> 01:40:09,164
- Get me on that plane.
- Hang on.

1216
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,735
Go. Go. Go.

1217
01:40:13,437 --> 01:40:15,301
You happy now, you big butch bastard?

1218
01:40:15,471 --> 01:40:18,562
Just go help Moe. Go help him.

1219
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,967
I want you to pull me right up
next to the port side.

1220
01:40:23,139 --> 01:40:24,435
What's a port side?

1221
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:26,503
Uh... The left side.

1222
01:40:26,673 --> 01:40:28,105
- Oh, okay.
- Right next to her.

1223
01:40:42,609 --> 01:40:44,439
- Go, go, go, stay with it.
- Okay.

1224
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:52,068
- My God, what are you doing?
- Pull right up next to the pontoon.

1225
01:41:19,249 --> 01:41:20,545
Whoa!

1226
01:41:24,517 --> 01:41:27,347
Now that's a man who loves his wife.

1227
01:41:33,918 --> 01:41:35,316
That's it.

1228
01:41:36,452 --> 01:41:37,782
That's it.

1229
01:41:57,722 --> 01:41:58,746
Oh!

1230
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,954
- Tess!
- Finn!

1231
01:42:16,225 --> 01:42:17,452
Tess!

1232
01:42:18,193 --> 01:42:19,284
Oh!

1233
01:42:19,459 --> 01:42:22,551
Damn, baby,
since when do you know how to fly?

1234
01:42:22,727 --> 01:42:24,784
Don't. Can't.

1235
01:42:26,561 --> 01:42:31,517
Well, you're doing a great job.
I mean, we're still in the air, right?

1236
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:33,024
Technically.

1237
01:42:34,062 --> 01:42:35,086
Oh, shit.

1238
01:42:36,296 --> 01:42:38,626
I think he hit the engine.

1239
01:42:39,363 --> 01:42:42,023
Okay. Um...

1240
01:42:42,264 --> 01:42:47,061
Wings, flaps, air speed, altitude...

1241
01:42:47,331 --> 01:42:51,196
...pedals for the rudder. Check. Okay.

1242
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,524
- How do you know what to do?
- You know...

1243
01:42:53,699 --> 01:42:55,598
...PlayStation. Ha-ha!

1244
01:42:57,633 --> 01:42:59,599
Oh, God.

1245
01:42:59,866 --> 01:43:01,298
- Oh, God.
- Hang on, hang on.

1246
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:03,092
Here we go. Aah!

1247
01:43:06,468 --> 01:43:08,832
Whoo! Finn!

1248
01:43:09,368 --> 01:43:11,857
- Wow. Whoa.
- Hey, you're doing it.

1249
01:43:12,035 --> 01:43:16,366
Way to go. That's great, oh, wow.
We're flying.

1250
01:43:16,903 --> 01:43:18,460
Yep.

1251
01:43:19,003 --> 01:43:20,128
How do we land?

1252
01:43:21,804 --> 01:43:23,100
Yep.

1253
01:43:25,071 --> 01:43:26,537
How'd you do it in the game?

1254
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:37,100
I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich!

1255
01:43:48,008 --> 01:43:51,134
Now, honey, this next part...

1256
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:54,673
...I'm not exactly sure how to pull off.

1257
01:43:55,110 --> 01:43:58,906
I do know that we've got to completely
stall out just before we hit the water.

1258
01:43:59,077 --> 01:44:00,737
- Stall?
- Stop flying.

1259
01:44:00,911 --> 01:44:04,139
- Stop flying?
- Yeah, and land.

1260
01:44:04,978 --> 01:44:07,809
On the nice soft... water.

1261
01:44:08,979 --> 01:44:11,411
- Are we gonna die?
- No.

1262
01:44:11,813 --> 01:44:13,506
No, we're not.

1263
01:44:17,981 --> 01:44:20,413
Oh, shit, where's Finn?

1264
01:44:20,981 --> 01:44:22,948
Probably he's flying the plane.

1265
01:44:23,114 --> 01:44:25,047
You mean there's hope?

1266
01:44:25,215 --> 01:44:27,613
Not necessarily.

1267
01:44:30,482 --> 01:44:32,812
- Hey, let me just say this.
- No.

1268
01:44:34,516 --> 01:44:36,448
- Well, why not?
- Because.

1269
01:44:36,616 --> 01:44:38,776
Tell me after we crash.

1270
01:44:41,018 --> 01:44:43,382
That'll give me something
to look forward to.

1271
01:44:56,620 --> 01:44:58,279
Okay.

1272
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,154
One hundred.

1273
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:21,621
We got it, baby. Eighty.

1274
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,548
Sixty.

1275
01:45:27,459 --> 01:45:28,483
Forty.

1276
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,154
Pull her up, boy.

1277
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:36,656
Baby, baby...

1278
01:45:36,828 --> 01:45:38,316
- I love you.
- I love you.

1279
01:45:38,494 --> 01:45:39,551
Pull her up.

1280
01:45:53,731 --> 01:45:54,754
Oh, shit.

1281
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:14,895
Finn?

1282
01:46:17,868 --> 01:46:19,300
I'm sorry.

1283
01:46:19,469 --> 01:46:23,128
I love you.
I've learned a lot from my mistakes.

1284
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:24,460
Marry me.

1285
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:26,363
No...

1286
01:46:26,869 --> 01:46:28,665
...you haven't.

1287
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:30,931
And, yes...

1288
01:46:31,104 --> 01:46:32,764
...I will.

1289
01:46:39,138 --> 01:46:40,297
Baby.

1290
01:46:40,472 --> 01:46:41,961
What?
