{126552}{126607}Rachel's come to see you.
{126661}{126714}-Rory's mum?|-Yeah.
{126716}{126764}Hi, l'm Simon Griffiths.|l'm the doctor.
{126766}{126863}l examined Rory before tea.|And l bet you're Rory's sister.
{126865}{126896}Yeah.
{126897}{126940}Hi. Hello, Rory.
{126941}{126992}So, why don't we have|a sit down...
{126993}{127039}and we can have|a bit of a chat, OK?
{127040}{127123}Make yourselves at home.|Get comfy.
{127186}{127241}-ls he gonna be all right?|-He'll be fine.
{127242}{127320}We've run some tests, X-ray,|checked his blood--
{127321}{127395}-Ain't he had a heart attack?|-Well, yes and no.
{127396}{127424}What do you mean?
{127425}{127476}He's had a kind of heart attack.
{127477}{127537}ln your heart,|you've got four chambers...
{127539}{127629}divided by a big wall|of muscle, OK?
{127630}{127685}And Rory's got a problem|with this muscle.
{127686}{127756}He ain't never had nothing|like that before.
{127757}{127794}That's the thing, you see.
{127795}{127845}He's probably had it|since he was a baby...
{127846}{127920}but it's only just|come to light.
{127921}{127998}l can't believe all this.
{127999}{128070}l know. We think|that's what must be wrong...
{128071}{128121}but the consultant's got to have|a look at him tomorrow.
{128122}{128150}What's going to happen?
{128151}{128198}Good news is he should|be home within a week.
{128199}{128254}But the thing|with this condition...
{128255}{128289}is that it won't just go away...
{128290}{128366}and we can't actually|cure it as such.
{128368}{128417}-Can't you?|-No. Afraid not.
{128418}{128457}We're gonna have|to put Rory on medication.
{128458}{128489}How long for?
{128490}{128540}Probably for the rest|of his life.
{128541}{128586}That don't seem right.
{128587}{128631}Not to worry.|Lots of people take pills...
{128632}{128697}every day of their lives and|they're none the worse for it.
{128698}{128729}Rory will just pop in...
{128730}{128775}see a cardiologist|every six months...
{128776}{128844}and everything should be cool.
{128913}{128961}He's through|the worst of it now.
{129047}{129085}He's only little.
{129087}{129162}-He's been a good lad.|-Yeah, he is a good lad.
{129164}{129205}Does he smoke?
{129206}{129252}No.
{129314}{129356}Yeah, he does a bit.
{129357}{129396}Fuck off.
{129397}{129473}Rory! Sorry, Doctor.
{129474}{129547}Once Rory's decided|whether he smokes or not...
{129548}{129583}he can give it up.
{129584}{129659}The same goes for burgers and|chips and fry-ups and crisps.
{129660}{129701}All that crap, eh, Rory?
{129702}{129785}The sooner you get rid of them,|the better it'll be for you.
{130066}{130107}-Hello?|-Phil, it's me.

{130746}{130797}What do you mean,|''What do l mean, heart attack''?
{130799}{130886}-ls he all right?|-No, he ain't all right!
{130887}{130917}He ain't dead, is he?
{130918}{130973}Of course he ain't dead.|Where are you?
