{1788}{1864}Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
{2423}{2461}Harry. Harry.
{2465}{2513}Harry, open the door.
{2678}{2734}Marge. How lovely to see...
{2739}{2820}Uncle Vernon,|I need you to sign this form.
{2824}{2856}What is it?
{2860}{2911}Nothing. School stuff.
{2915}{2979}Later perhaps, if you behave.
{2983}{3036}I will if she does.
{3040}{3115}- Oh, you're still here, are you?|- Yes.
{3125}{3188}Don't say yes|in that ungrateful way.
{3192}{3239}Damn good of my brother|to keep you.
{3243}{3347}He'd have been straight to an orphanage|if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
{3351}{3456}Is that my Dudders?|Is that my little neffy-pooh?
{3460}{3503}Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
{3507}{3562}Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
{3566}{3613}Okay.
{3694}{3763}Finish that off for Mommy.|Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
{3787}{3858}- Can I tempt you, Marge?|- Just a small one.
{3863}{3934}Excellent nosh, Petunia.
{3948}{3996}A bit more.
{4009}{4088}Usually just a fry-up for me,|what with 12 dogs.
{4093}{4155}Just a bit more. That's a boy.
{4229}{4277}You wanna try|a little drop of brandy?
{4281}{4378}A little drop of brandy-brandy|windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
{4414}{4457}What are you smirking at?
{4461}{4505}Where did you send the boy,|Vernon?
{4510}{4589}St. Brutus'. It's a fine|institution for hopeless cases.
{4593}{4665}Do they use a cane|at St. Brutus', boy?
{4748}{4780}Oh, yeah.
{4785}{4849}Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
{4853}{4915}Excellent. I won't have this|namby-pamby...
{4920}{4995}...wishy-washy nonsense about|not beating people who deserve it.
{4999}{5074}You mustn't blame yourself|about how this one turned out.
{5078}{5172}It's all to do with blood.|Bad blood will out.
{5176}{5228}What is it the boy's father did,|Petunia?
{5232}{5304}Nothing. He didn't work.|He was unemployed.
{5308}{5376}- And a drunk too, no doubt?|- That's a lie.
{5380}{5441}- What did you say?|- My dad wasn't a drunk.
{5513}{5611}Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.|I have a very firm grip.
{5615}{5659}I think it's time you went to bed.
{5663}{5741}Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
{5774}{5846}Actually, it's nothing to do|with the father.
{5851}{5941}It's all to do with the mother.|You see it all the time with dogs.
{5945}{6042}If something's wrong with the bitch,|then something's wrong with the pup.
{6047}{6087}Shut up! Shut up!
{6207}{6249}Right.
{6253}{6304}Let me tell you...
{6818}{6869}Vernon!
{6942}{6985}Vernon! Vernon, do something!
{8027}{8075}Stop!
{8137}{8198}I've got you, Marge. I've got you.
{8281}{8328}- Hold on, hold on.|- Get off.
{8359}{8402}- Don't you dare!|- Sorry.
{8431}{8475}Oh, Vernon.
{8479}{8521}Oh, God.
{8525}{8568}Marge!
{8737}{8790}Please!
{8805}{8858}Marge!
{8884}{8960}Come back!
{9535}{9593}You bring her back!|You bring her back now.
{9597}{9675}- You put her right!|- No. She deserved what she got.
{9686}{9761}- Keep away from me.|- You can't do magic outside school.
{9766}{9838}- Yeah? Try me.|- They won't let you back now.
{9842}{9874}You've nowhere to go.
{9878}{9934}I don't care.|Anywhere is better than here.
{12239}{12283}"Welcome to the Knight Bus...
{12287}{12368}...emergency transport|for the stranded witch or wizard.
{12372}{12491}My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be|your conductor for this evening. "
{12581}{12615}What you doing down there?
{12633}{12685}- I fell over.|- What you fall over for?
{12690}{12754}- I didn't do it on purpose.|- Well, come on, then.
{12759}{12811}Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
{12982}{13055}- What you looking at?|- Nothing.
{13059}{13101}Well, come on, then. In.
{13105}{13173}No, no, no. I'll get this.|You get in.
{13292}{13345}Come on.
{13582}{13648}Come on. Move on, move on.
{14002}{14080}- Take her away, Ern.|- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
{14084}{14138}It's going to be a bumpy ride.
{14394}{14473}- What did you say your name was?|- I didn't.
{14487}{14585}- Whereabouts are you headed?|- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
{14590}{14660}You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.|That's in London. "
{14664}{14720}The Leaky Cauldron.|If you have pea soup...
{14724}{14791}...make sure you eat it|before it eats you.
{14873}{14936}- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?|- Muggles?
{14940}{14982}They don't see nothing, do they?
{14986}{15047}No, but if you jab them|with a fork, they feel.
{15089}{15162}Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
{15372}{15433}Ten, nine, eight...
{15438}{15503}...seven, six, five...
{15508}{15562}...four, three, three and a half...
{15567}{15610}...two, one and three quarters.
{15623}{15662}Yes!
{15766}{15799}Who is that?
{15804}{15861}That man.
{15901}{15944}Who is that?
{15949}{15985}Who is...?
{15990}{16047}That is Sirius Black, that is.
{16061}{16139}Don't tell me you've never|been hearing of Sirius Black.
{16170}{16225}He's a murderer.
{16229}{16292}Got himself locked up|in Azkaban for it.
{16308}{16390}- How did he escape?|- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
{16394}{16441}He's the first one that done it.
{16464}{16527}He was a big supporter of...
{16539}{16575}...You-Know-Who.
{16592}{16637}I reckon you've heard of him.
{16641}{16679}Yeah.
{16683}{16715}Him I've heard of.
{16779}{16843}Ernie, two double-deckers|at 12 o'clock.
{16855}{16895}They're getting closer, Ernie.
{16914}{16968}Ernie, they're right on top of us!
{17145}{17203}Mind your head.
{17320}{17367}Hey, guys? Guys?
{17372}{17424}Why the long faces?
{17564}{17622}Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.
{17753}{17834}- The Leaky Cauldron.|- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
{17866}{17930}Mr. Potter, at last.
{18002}{18067}- Take it away, Ern.|- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
{18623}{18667}Room 11.
{18729}{18761}Hedwig.
{18765}{18833}Right smart bird|you got there, Mr. Potter.
{18837}{18926}He arrived here just|five minutes before yourself.
{18972}{19059}As Minister for Magic, it is my duty|to inform you, Mr. Potter...
{19063}{19140}...earlier this evening|your uncle's sister was located...
{19144}{19239}...a little south of Sheffield,|circling a chimney stack.
{19243}{19333}The Accidental Magic Reversal|Department was dispatched immediately.
{19337}{19452}She has been properly punctured|and her memory modified.
{19457}{19569}She will have no recollection|of the incident whatsoever.
{19573}{19635}So that's that...
{19639}{19708}...and no harm done.
{19724}{19756}Pea soup?
{19760}{19811}No, thank you.
{19815}{19868}- Minister?|- Yes?
{19872}{19914}- I don't understand.|- Understand?
{19919}{20004}I broke the law. Underage wizards|can't use magic at home.
{20009}{20081}Come now. The Ministry|doesn't send people to Azkaban...
{20085}{20146}...for blowing up their aunts.
{20241}{20350}On the other hand, running away|like that, given the state of things...
{20354}{20413}...was very, very irresponsible.
{20418}{20509}- "The state of things," sir?|- We have a killer on the loose.
{20513}{20557}Sirius Black, you mean?
{20561}{20603}But what's he got to do with me?
{20658}{20774}Nothing, of course. You're safe.|And that's what matters.
{20779}{20854}And tomorrow you'll be|on your way back to Hogwarts.
{20858}{20929}These are your new schoolbooks.|I took the liberty...
{20933}{21029}...of having them brought here.|Now Tom will show you to your room.
{21144}{21176}Hedwig.
{21184}{21302}Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're|here, it would be best if you didn't...
{21309}{21368}...wander.
{21406}{21475}Right! You gonna move|that bus or what?
{23364}{23413}Housekeeping.
{23495}{23549}I'll come back later.
{23731}{23765}I'm warning you, Hermione.
{23769}{23858}Keep that beast away from Scabbers,|or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
{23862}{23912}It's a cat, Ronald.|What do you expect?
{23916}{23988}- It's in his nature.|- A cat? Is that what they told you?
{23992}{24053}- Looks like a pig with hair.|- That's rich...
{24057}{24118}...coming from the owner|of that smelly old shoe brush.
{24122}{24180}Crookshanks, just ignore|the mean little boy.
{24185}{24223}Harry.
{24249}{24283}Harry.
{24311}{24385}- Egypt. What's it like?|- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...
{24390}{24470}...like mummies, tombs,|even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
{24475}{24551}- Egyptians used to worship cats.|- Along with the dung beetle.
{24555}{24631}- Not flashing that clipping again?|- I haven't shown anyone.
{24635}{24693}No, not a soul.|Not unless you count Tom.
{24697}{24731}- The day maid.|- Night maid.
{24735}{24786}- Cook.|- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
{24790}{24824}- Harry.|- Mrs. Weasley.
{24828}{24880}- Good to see you, dear.|- Good to see you.
{24884}{24916}- Got everything?|- Yes.
{24920}{24972}- Yes? All your books?|- It's all upstairs.
{24976}{25010}- Your clothes?|- Everything.
{25014}{25048}- Good boy.|- Thank you.
{25052}{25097}- Harry Potter.|- Mr. Weasley.
{25101}{25185}- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?|- Yeah, sure.
{25190}{25253}- Hermione.|- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
{25257}{25344}- Looking forward to a new term?|- Yeah. It should be great.
{25418}{25510}Harry, some within the Ministry|would strongly discourage me...
{25514}{25578}...from divulging what I'm about|to reveal to you.
{25582}{25662}But I think that you need|to know the facts.
{25666}{25728}You are in danger.
{25744}{25803}Grave danger.
{25815}{25878}Has this anything to do|with Sirius Black, sir?
{25898}{25955}What do you know|about Sirius Black, Harry?
{25959}{26048}- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.|- Do you know why?
{26065}{26132}Thirteen years ago,|when you stopped...
{26136}{26180}- Voldemort.|- Don't say his name.
{26184}{26216}Sorry.
{26220}{26290}When you stopped You-Know-Who...
{26294}{26333}...Black lost everything.
{26337}{26440}But to this day, he still remains|a faithful servant.
{26444}{26496}And in his mind...
{26500}{26572}...you are the only thing|that stands in the way...
{26576}{26666}...of You-Know-Who|returning to power.
{26670}{26722}And that is why...
{26726}{26787}...he has escaped from Azkaban.
{26795}{26836}To find you.
{26871}{26910}And kill me.
{26933}{26997}Harry, swear to me|that whatever you might hear...
{27001}{27062}...you won't go looking for Black.
{27071}{27103}Mr. Weasley...
{27107}{27203}...why would I go looking|for someone who wants to kill me?
{27222}{27261}Quick. Quick.
{27268}{27312}Ron, Ron!
{27329}{27379}Oh, for goodness' sake!
{27384}{27443}Don't lose him!
{27468}{27518}I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
{27522}{27581}- I lost control.|- Brilliant.
{27585}{27671}Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.|Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
{27675}{27717}I was lucky not to be arrested.
{27721}{27770}I still think it was brilliant.
{27784}{27840}Come on. Everywhere else is full.
{27908}{27941}Who do you think that is?
{27945}{28014}- Professor R.J. Lupin.|- Do you know everything?
{28018}{28069}How is it she knows everything?
{28073}{28148}- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.|- Oh.
{28155}{28234}- Do you think he's really asleep?|- Seems to be. Why?
{28275}{28326}I gotta tell you something.
{28643}{28723}Let me get this straight.|Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
{28727}{28771}...to come after you?|- Yeah.
{28775}{28823}But they'll catch Black, won't they?
{28827}{28892}- I mean, everyone's looking for him.|- Sure.
{28896}{28976}Except no one's ever broken out|of Azkaban before...
{28980}{29076}...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.|- Thanks, Ron.
{29111}{29150}Why are we stopping?
{29175}{29217}We can't be there yet.
{29319}{29372}What's going on?
{29377}{29441}I don't know.|Maybe we've broken down.
{29487}{29543}Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
{29564}{29610}There's something moving out there.
{29936}{30009}I think someone's coming aboard.
{30613}{30682}Bloody hell! What's happening?
{32415}{32449}Harry.
{32475}{32519}Harry, are you all right?
{32667}{32707}Thank you.
{32735}{32794}Here, eat this. It'll help.
{32806}{32857}It's all right. It's chocolate.
{33008}{33058}What was that thing that came?
{33062}{33144}It was a dementor. One of the guards|of Azkaban. It's gone now.
{33148}{33213}It was searching the train|for Sirius Black.
{33217}{33304}If you'll excuse me, I need to have|a little word with the driver.
{33414}{33484}Eat. You'll feel better.
{33623}{33655}What happened to me?
{33659}{33701}Well, you sort of went rigid.
{33705}{33781}We thought maybe you were|having a fit or something.
{33823}{33866}And did either of you two...
{33870}{33902}...you know...
{33906}{33980}...pass out?|- No.
{33984}{34025}I felt weird, though.
{34029}{34073}Like I'd never be cheerful again.
{34103}{34156}But someone was screaming.
{34160}{34193}A woman.
{34216}{34264}No one was screaming, Harry.
{35683}{35773}Welcome! Welcome to another year|at Hogwarts.
{35778}{35827}Now, I'd like to say a few words...
{35831}{35935}...before we all become too befuddled|by our excellent feast.
{35939}{36017}First, I'm pleased to welcome|Professor R.J. Lupin...
{36022}{36080}...who's kindly consented|to fill the post...
{36085}{36144}...of Defense Against|the Dark Arts teacher.
{36148}{36209}Good luck, professor.
{36319}{36399}Of course. That's why he knew|to give you the chocolate, Harry.
{36403}{36467}Potter. Is it true you fainted?
{36487}{36559}- I mean, you actually fainted?|- Shove off, Malfoy.
{36563}{36611}- How did he find out?|- Just forget it.
{36615}{36672}Our Care of Magical Creatures|teacher...
{36677}{36722}...has decided to retire...
{36726}{36816}...in order to spend more time|with his remaining limbs.
{36821}{36886}Fortunately,|I'm delighted to announce...
{36890}{36958}...that his place will be taken|by none other...
{36962}{37066}...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
{37336}{37403}Finally, on a more disquieting note...
{37408}{37468}...at the request|of the Ministry of Magic...
{37473}{37597}...Hogwarts will, until further notice,|play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
{37613}{37696}...until such a time|as Sirius Black is captured.
{37719}{37807}The dementors will be stationed|at every entrance to the grounds.
{37811}{37851}Now whilst I've been assured...
{37855}{37943}...that their presence will not disrupt|our day-to-day activities...
{37947}{37979}...a word of caution.
{37984}{38060}Dementors are vicious creatures.|They'll not distinguish...
{38064}{38146}...between the one they hunt|and the one who gets in their way.
{38150}{38237}Therefore, I must warn|each and every one of you...
{38241}{38328}...to give them no reason|to harm you.
{38346}{38469}It is not in the nature|of a dementor to be forgiving.
{38520}{38599}But you know,|happiness can be found...
{38603}{38690}...even in the darkest of times...
{38719}{38812}...if one only remembers|to turn on the light.
{39100}{39148}{Y:i}Fortuna Major.
{39216}{39280}Here, listen.|She just won't let me in.
{39285}{39355}{Y:i}- Fortuna Major.|- No, no. Wait, wait.
{39359}{39403}Watch this.
{39661}{39780}{Y:i}- Amazing. Just with my voice.|- Fortuna Major.
{39785}{39870}- Yes, all right. Go in.|- Thank you.
{39918}{39966}Still doing that after three years.
{39970}{40022}- She can't even sing.|- Exactly.
{40051}{40103}- Hey, man.|- Hey, man.
{40128}{40161}- Oh, God.|- That's awful.
{40184}{40236}Green. That's a monkey.
{40279}{40343}- What is that?|- You call that a monkey?
{40347}{40400}Do not give him one again.
{40404}{40467}Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
{40637}{40679}- Ron, catch.|- I will.
{40815}{40854}I think we have a winner.
{40877}{40933}- Oh, don't try one of them.|- Oh, no.
{40948}{41008}Look at him. His face.
{42054}{42108}{Y:i}Welcome, my children.
{42113}{42235}In this room, you shall explore|the noble art of Divination.
{42239}{42366}In this room, you shall discover|if you possess the Sight.
{42400}{42495}Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
{42499}{42610}Together we shall cast ourselves|into the future.
{42615}{42707}This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,|the art of reading tea leaves.
{42711}{42797}So please, take the cup|of the person sitting opposite you.
{42809}{42842}What do you see?
{42846}{42982}The truth lies buried like a sentence|deep within a book, waiting to be read.
{42987}{43045}But first, you must broaden|your minds.
{43049}{43158}- First, you must look beyond.|- What a load of rubbish.
{43162}{43208}- Where did you come from?|- Me?
{43212}{43276}- I've been here all this time.|- You, boy...
{43280}{43335}Is your grandmother quite well?
{43351}{43386}I think so.
{43390}{43457}I wouldn't be so sure of that.|Give me the cup.
{43529}{43562}Pity.
{43567}{43630}Broaden your minds.
{43716}{43796}Your aura is pulsing, dear.|Are you in the beyond?
{43800}{43846}- I think you are.|- Sure.
{43851}{43904}Look at the cup.|Tell me what you see.
{43908}{43949}Yeah.
{43969}{44075}Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.|That's trials and suffering.
{44086}{44173}And that there could be the sun|and that's happiness.
{44178}{44210}So...
{44214}{44311}...you're gonna suffer,|but you're gonna be happy about it.
{44316}{44348}Give me the cup.
{44410}{44455}Oh, my dear boy.
{44505}{44545}My dear...
{44585}{44659}...you have the Grim.
{44679}{44721}The Grin? What's the Grin?
{44725}{44794}Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
{44798}{44850}"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
{44855}{44914}It's among the darkest omens|in our world.
{44927}{44967}It's an omen...
{44971}{45015}...of death. "
{45123}{45215}You don't think that Grim thing's|got anything to do with Sirius Black?
{45219}{45314}Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,|Divination's a woolly discipline.
{45318}{45406}Now, Ancient Runes,|that's a fascinating subject.
{45410}{45485}Ancient Runes? Exactly how many|classes are you taking?
{45489}{45529}A fair few.
{45533}{45583}Hang on. That's not possible.
{45587}{45654}Ancient Runes is in the|same time as Divination.
{45658}{45706}You have to be in two|classes at once.
{45710}{45791}Don't be silly. How could anyone|be in two classes at once?
{45795}{45897}"Broaden your minds. Use your|Inner Eye to see the future. "
{45925}{46020}That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.|Less talking, if you don't mind.
{46024}{46068}I got a real treat for you today.
{46072}{46120}A great lesson. So follow me.
{46390}{46464}Right, you lot. Less chattering.|Form a group over there.
{46468}{46528}And open your books to page 49.
{46532}{46571}Exactly how do we do that?
{46576}{46669}Just stroke the spine, of course.|Goodness me.
{46894}{46985}- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.|- I'm okay. Okay.
{47073}{47150}- I think they're funny.|- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
{47155}{47214}Witty. God, this place|has gone to the dogs.
{47219}{47307}Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's|got this oaf teaching classes.
{47330}{47362}Shut up, Malfoy.
{47710}{47759}Dementor! Dementor!
{47951}{48025}- Just ignore him.|- You're supposed to stroke it.
{48029}{48064}Yeah.
{48309}{48381}Isn't he beautiful?
{48385}{48448}Say hello to Buckbeak.
{48462}{48516}Hagrid, exactly what is that?
{48521}{48570}That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
{48574}{48658}First thing you wanna know|is they're very proud creatures.
{48663}{48756}Very easily offended.|You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
{48760}{48826}It may be the last thing you ever do.
{48830}{48911}Now, who'd like to come|and say hello?
{48972}{49022}Well done, Harry. Well done.
{49089}{49122}Come on now.
{49135}{49167}Now...
{49172}{49261}...you have to let him make the first|move. It's only polite. So...
{49265}{49310}...step up. Give him a nice bow.
{49315}{49373}Then you wait|and see if he bows back.
{49377}{49428}If he does, you can go and touch him.
{49432}{49509}If not... Well,|we'll get to that later.
{49573}{49622}Just make your bow.
{49660}{49700}Nice and low.
{49828}{49868}Back off, Harry. Back off.
{49913}{49949}Keep still.
{49989}{50037}Keep still.
{50233}{50339}Well done, Harry. Well done.|Here, you big brute, you.
{50399}{50460}Right. I think you can go|and pat him now.
{50465}{50509}Go on. Don't be shy.
{50711}{50770}Nice and slow, now.|Nice and slow. Slow.
{50850}{50884}Not so fast, Harry.
{51006}{51084}Slow down, Harry. That's it...
{51089}{51165}Nice and slow.|Now let him come to you.
{51210}{51266}Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
{51271}{51314}That's it...
{51329}{51361}Yes!
{51375}{51457}Well done! Well done, Harry,|well done!
{51461}{51509}Does he get to fly?
{51514}{51571}- I think he may let you ride him now.|- What?
{51576}{51613}- Come on.|- Hey, hey, hey!
{51617}{51693}Put you over here,|just behind the wing joint.
{51709}{51814}Don't pull out any of his feathers,|because he won't thank you for that.
{54234}{54318}Well done, Harry, and well done,|Buckbeak.
{54323}{54369}That was wicked, Harry!
{54374}{54407}Oh, please.
{54426}{54482}Well done, well done.
{54498}{54575}- How am I doing me first day?|- Brilliant, professor.
{54657}{54758}You're not dangerous at all, are you,|you great ugly brute!
{54763}{54796}Malfoy, no...
{54818}{54853}No!
{54870}{54909}Buckbeak!
{54914}{54965}Whoa, whoa, whoa...
{54993}{55036}Whoa! Buckbeak!
{55063}{55119}Away, you silly creature...
{55124}{55198}- It's killed me!|- Calm down. It's just a scratch!
{55203}{55232}Hagrid!
{55236}{55361}- He has to be taken to the hospital.|- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
{55434}{55503}- You're gonna regret this.|- Class dismissed!
{55507}{55562}You and your bloody chicken!
{56125}{56174}Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
{56179}{56271}It comes and it goes.|Still, I consider myself lucky.
{56275}{56355}Madam Pomfrey said another minute|and I could've lost my arm.
{56363}{56432}- I can't do homework for weeks.|- Listen to the idiot.
{56438}{56540}- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?|- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
{56545}{56634}I hear Draco's father's furious.|We haven't heard the end of this.
{56639}{56683}- He's been sighted!|- Who?
{56688}{56729}Sirius Black!
{56754}{56826}Dufftown? That's not far from here.
{56836}{56899}You don't think he'd come|to Hogwarts, do you?
{56903}{56963}- With dementors at every entrance?|- Dementors?
{56967}{57047}He slipped past them once.|Who's to say he won't do it again?
{57052}{57161}That's right. Black could be anywhere.|It's like trying to catch smoke.
{57180}{57256}Like trying to catch smoke|with your bare hands.
{57882}{57932}Intriguing, isn't it?
{58010}{58076}Would anyone like to venture|a guess...
{58080}{58123}...as to what is inside?
{58128}{58224}- That's a boggart, that is.|- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
{58242}{58312}Now, can anybody tell me|what a boggart looks like?
{58317}{58366}- No one knows.|- When did she get here?
{58371}{58407}Boggarts are shape-shifters.
{58412}{58489}They take the shape of whatever|a person fears the most.
{58494}{58600}- That's what makes them so...|- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
{58605}{58736}Luckily, a very simple charm exists|to repel a boggart.
{58769}{58859}Let's practice it now.|Without wands, please.
{58866}{58926}{Y:i}After me. Riddikulus!
{58931}{58982}{Y:i}- Riddikulus!|- Very good.
{58987}{59047}A little louder and very clear.|Listen:
{59052}{59105}{Y:i}- Riddikulus!|- Riddikulus!
{59110}{59160}- This class is ridiculous.|- Very good.
{59165}{59261}So much for the easy part. You see,|the incantation alone is not enough.
{59266}{59355}What really finishes a boggart|is laughter.
{59360}{59466}You need to force it to assume|a shape you find truly amusing.
{59470}{59569}Let me explain. Neville,|would you join me, please?
{59574}{59630}Come on, don't be shy. Come on.
{59654}{59694}Come on.
{59705}{59789}Hello. Neville, what frightens you|most of all?
{59794}{59834}Professor Snape.
{59839}{59883}- Sorry?|- Professor Snape.
{59887}{59969}Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
{59973}{60081}- You live with your grandmother.|- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
{60093}{60131}No...
{60151}{60218}...it won't. I want you|to picture her clothes.
{60224}{60301}Only her clothes, very clearly,|in your mind.
{60306}{60380}- She carries a red handbag...|- We don't need to hear.
{60384}{60477}As long as you see it, we'll see it.|Now, when I open that wardrobe...
{60482}{60561}...here's what I want|you to do. Excuse me.
{60572}{60642}Imagine Professor Snape|in your grandmother's clothes.
{60647}{60688}Can you do that?
{60702}{60767}Yes. Wand at the ready.
{60775}{60859}One, two, three.
{61094}{61139}Think, Neville, think.
{61205}{61254}{Y:i}Riddikulus!
{61363}{61427}Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!|Incredible! Okay...
{61432}{61502}...to the back, Neville.|Everyone, form a line...
{61651}{61683}Form a line!
{61687}{61769}I want everyone to picture the thing|they fear the very most...
{61774}{61848}...and turn it into something funny.
{61853}{61894}Next! Ron!
{61971}{62056}Concentrate. Face your fear.|Be brave!
{62331}{62368}Wand at the ready, Ron.
{62386}{62430}{Y:i}Riddikulus!
{62434}{62466}Yes!
{62481}{62550}You see? Very good, very good!
{62562}{62702}Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very|enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
{62745}{62798}Show us what you see.
{63020}{63102}Keep your nerve. Steady.
{63106}{63153}{Y:i}Riddikulus!
{63178}{63225}And next! Step up, step up!
{63251}{63295}Wonderful, wonderful!
{63631}{63682}Here!
{63822}{63866}{Y:i}Riddikulus!
{64070}{64140}Right. Sorry about that.|That's enough for today.
{64144}{64192}Collect your books from the back.
{64196}{64259}That's the end of the lesson.|Thank you! Sorry!
{64263}{64336}Sorry, you can have too much|of a good thing.
{64384}{64494}Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade|village are a privilege.
{64501}{64569}Should your behavior reflect poorly|on the school...
{64573}{64643}...that privilege shall not|be extended again.
{64654}{64733}No permission form signed,|no visiting the village.
{64737}{64774}That's the rule, Potter.
{64779}{64856}Those with permission, follow me.|Those without, stay put.
{64860}{64920}I thought if you signed it,|then I could...
{64924}{64984}I can't. Only a parent|or a guardian can sign.
{64988}{65065}Since I am neither,|it would be inappropriate.
{65120}{65230}I'm sorry, Potter.|That's my final word.
{65259}{65337}Forget about it, guys. See you later.
{65668}{65717}Professor, can I ask you something?
{65722}{65814}You want to know why I stopped you|facing that boggart, yes?
{65819}{65853}I thought it'd be obvious.
{65857}{65925}I assumed it would take the shape|of Lord Voldemort.
{65929}{66013}I did think of Voldemort at first.
{66018}{66081}But then I remembered that night|on the train...
{66085}{66146}...and the dementor.|- I'm very impressed.
{66150}{66219}That suggests what you fear the most|is fear itself.
{66223}{66259}This is very wise.
{66263}{66313}Before I fainted...
{66319}{66367}...I heard something.
{66380}{66419}A woman...
{66430}{66462}...screaming.
{66467}{66545}Dementors force us to relive|our very worst memories.
{66550}{66620}Our pain becomes their power.
{66640}{66693}I think it was my mother...
{66697}{66750}...the night she was murdered.
{66789}{66896}The very first time I saw you, Harry,|I recognized you immediately.
{66910}{66978}Not by your scar, by your eyes.
{66988}{67040}They're your mother, Lily's.
{67062}{67097}Yes.
{67105}{67177}Oh, yes. I knew her.
{67233}{67325}Your mother was there for me|at a time when no one else was.
{67330}{67407}Not only was she|a singularly gifted witch...
{67411}{67491}...she was also|an uncommonly kind woman.
{67503}{67577}She had a way of seeing|the beauty in others...
{67581}{67705}...even, and most especially, when that|person could not see it in themselves.
{67764}{67829}And your father, James,|on the other hand...
{67833}{67870}...he...
{67882}{67962}He had a certain, shall we say,|talent for trouble.
{68017}{68149}A talent, rumor has it,|he passed on to you.
{68245}{68316}You're more like them|than you know, Harry.
{68336}{68411}In time, you'll come to see|just how much.
{68494}{68599}Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,|but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
{68604}{68665}We never got to go|to the Shrieking Shack.
{68669}{68766}- You heard it's the most...|- Haunted building in Britain. I know.
{68799}{68835}What's going on?
{68839}{68898}Probably Neville forgot|the password again.
{68902}{68960}- Hey.|- Oh, you're there.
{68964}{69067}Let me through, please.|Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
{69106}{69146}Get back, all of you.
{69150}{69226}No one is to enter this dormitory|until it's been searched.
{69230}{69262}The Fat Lady! She's gone!
{69312}{69371}Serves her right.|She was a terrible singer.
{69375}{69421}It's not funny, Ron.
{69469}{69567}Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.|Back to your common room.
{69719}{69744}- Be quiet.|- Make way.
{69749}{69796}- The headmaster's here.|- Come on, move.
{69801}{69846}You heard. Move!
{70187}{70256}Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
{70264}{70362}Tell them to search every painting|in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
{70367}{70441}There's no need for ghosts, professor.
{70461}{70512}The Fat Lady's there.
{70532}{70580}Mind where you're going! Slow down!
{70594}{70658}You listen! I'm Head Boy!
{70662}{70720}- Come back here!|- Keep moving!
{70806}{70875}Dear lady, who did this to you?
{70921}{71042}Eyes like the devil, he's got,|and a soul as dark as his name.
{71064}{71136}It's him, headmaster.|The one they all talk about.
{71140}{71199}He's here, somewhere in the castle!
{71205}{71257}Sirius Black!
{71262}{71385}Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.|The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
{72058}{72176}I've searched the Astronomy Tower|and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
{72180}{72242}- Thank you.|- The third floor's clear too, sir.
{72246}{72293}- Very good.|- I've done the dungeons.
{72297}{72361}No sign of Black, nor anywhere else|in the castle.
{72366}{72426}I didn't really expect him to linger.
{72456}{72512}Remarkable feat, don't you think?
{72516}{72571}To enter Hogwarts Castle|on one's own...
{72575}{72639}...completely undetected?|- Quite remarkable, yes.
{72644}{72688}Any theories on how he managed it?
{72693}{72764}Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
{72770}{72807}You may recall...
{72811}{72879}...prior to the start of term|I expressed concerns...
{72883}{72933}...about your appointment|of Professor...
{72937}{73035}Not a single professor inside this castle|would help Sirius Black enter it.
{73039}{73097}I'm quite convinced|the castle is safe...
{73101}{73188}...and I'm more than willing to send|the students to their houses.
{73192}{73248}What about Potter?|Should he be warned?
{73253}{73316}Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
{73337}{73450}For in dreams, we enter a world|that's entirely our own.
{73457}{73565}Let them swim in the deepest ocean|or glide over the highest cloud.
{74508}{74588}Turn to page 394.
{74814}{74900}Excuse me, sir.|Where's Professor Lupin?
{74917}{74999}That's not really your concern,|is it, Potter?
{75003}{75096}Suffice it to say your professor|finds himself incapable of teaching...
{75101}{75222}...at the present time.|Turn to page 394.
{75338}{75378}"Werewolves"?
{75386}{75452}Sir, we just learned about red caps|and hinkypunks.
{75458}{75533}- We're not meant to start that for weeks.|- Quiet.
{75538}{75614}When did she come in?|Did you see her come in?
{75629}{75713}Now, which one of you|can tell me the difference...
{75718}{75776}...between an Animagus|and a werewolf?
{75793}{75839}No one?
{75851}{75921}- How disappointing.|- Please, sir.
{75926}{76002}An Animagus is a wizard|who elects to turn into an animal.
{76006}{76043}A werewolf has no choice.
{76053}{76094}With each full moon...
{76098}{76191}...he no longer remembers who he is.|He'd kill his best friend.
{76196}{76282}The werewolf only responds|to the call of its own kind.
{76310}{76376}Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.|That's the second time...
{76380}{76436}...you've spoken out of turn,|Miss Granger.
{76440}{76488}Are you incapable|of restraining yourself...
{76492}{76572}...or do you take pride|in being an insufferable know-it-all?
{76579}{76661}- He's got a point, you know.|- Five points from Gryffindor.
{76666}{76776}As an antidote to your ignorance,|and on my desk, by Monday morning...
{76781}{76870}...two rolls of parchment|on the werewolf, with emphasis...
{76874}{76936}...on recognizing it.|- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
{76962}{77042}Then I suggest you take extra care,|Mr. Potter.
{77047}{77144}Loss of limb will not excuse you.
{77149}{77239}Page 394.
{77287}{77322}The term "werewolf"...
{77344}{77452}{Y:i}...is a contraction|of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...
{77470}{77576}...which means "man, " and "wolf. "|Werewolf, man-wolf.
{77592}{77648}There are several ways|to become a werewolf.
{77653}{77725}They include being given the power|of shape-shifting...
{77731}{77777}...being bitten by a werewolf...
{78228}{78315}Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
{81187}{81255}{Y:i}Aresto momentum!
{81309}{81384}- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?|- Peaky?
{81388}{81443}What do you expect?|He fell over 100 feet.
{81447}{81516}Let's walk you off a tower|and see what you look like.
{81521}{81594}Probably a right sight better|than he normally does.
{81682}{81753}- How are you feeling?|- Oh, brilliant.
{81758}{81805}You gave us a right good scare.
{81811}{81895}- What happened?|- Well, you fell off your broom.
{81902}{81958}Really? I meant the match. Who won?
{82064}{82105}No one blames you, Harry.
{82110}{82202}Dementors aren't supposed to be|on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
{82207}{82257}After he saved you,|he sent them off.
{82261}{82349}There's something else|you should know too.
{82362}{82490}When you fell, your broom sort of blew|into the Whomping Willow, and...
{82526}{82562}Well...
{82592}{82647}{Y:i}I'm sorry to hear|about your broomstick.
{82655}{82718}Is there no chance of fixing it?
{82722}{82755}No.
{82759}{82839}Professor, why do the dementors|affect me so?
{82849}{82923}- I mean, more than everyone else?|- Listen.
{82927}{83003}Dementors are the foulest creatures|to walk this earth.
{83008}{83110}They feed on every good feeling,|every happy memory...
{83123}{83233}...until a person is left with absolutely|nothing but his worst experiences.
{83238}{83339}You are not weak, Harry.
{83343}{83441}Dementors affect you most because|there are true horrors in your past.
{83446}{83520}Horrors your classmates|can scarcely imagine.
{83531}{83586}You have nothing to be ashamed of.
{83591}{83688}- I'm scared, professor.|- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
{83692}{83776}I need to know how to fight them.|You could teach me.
{83780}{83828}You made the one|on the train go away.
{83833}{83875}There was only one that night.
{83882}{83992}- But you made it go away.|- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
{84000}{84119}But as the dementors seem|to have developed an interest in you...
{84123}{84211}...perhaps I should teach you.|But after the holidays.
{84215}{84261}For now, I need to rest.
{84871}{84974}Last call for Hogsmeade!|Come on, now!
{85348}{85396}- Guys, let me go.|- Clever, Harry.
{85400}{85470}- But not clever enough.|- We've got a better way.
{85474}{85542}- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.|- We know.
{85546}{85575}We'll get you there.
{85579}{85644}- We'll show you a quicker way.|- Lf you pipe down.
{85648}{85734}- Bless him.|- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
{85749}{85811}- Now, Harry.|- Come and join the big boys.
{85845}{85896}What are you doing?!
{85902}{85970}- What's this rubbish?|- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
{85974}{86054}- It's the secret to our success.|- It's a wrench giving it to you...
{86058}{86128}But we've decided|your needs are greater than ours.
{86132}{86174}George, if you will.
{86178}{86257}I solemnly swear|that I am up to no good.
{86344}{86430}"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,|Padfoot and Prongs...
{86440}{86511}...are proud to present|the Marauder's Map. "
{86517}{86571}We owe them so much.
{86656}{86748}Hang on. This is Hogwarts.|And that...
{86752}{86811}- No. Is that really...?|- Dumbledore.
{86815}{86847}- In his study.|- Pacing.
{86851}{86898}Does that a lot.
{86903}{86947}- So this map shows...|- Everyone.
{86952}{87000}- Where they are.|- What they're doing.
{87004}{87031}- Every minute.|- Every day.
{87035}{87107}- Brilliant! Where did you get it?|- From Filch's office.
{87111}{87177}- First year.|- There are seven secret passageways...
{87181}{87245}...out of the castle.|- We'd recommend this one.
{87249}{87325}- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.|- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
{87329}{87373}Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
{87377}{87459}And don't forget. When you're done,|just give it a tap and say:
{87463}{87567}"Mischief managed. "|Otherwise, anyone can read it.
{88414}{88467}Now, how much do you want?
{88642}{88688}Delicious.
{88880}{88978}It's meant to be the most haunted|building in Britain. Did I mention that?
{88982}{89022}Twice.
{89039}{89095}Do you want to move a bit closer?
{89100}{89141}To the Shrieking Shack?
{89148}{89217}Actually, I'm fine here.
{89221}{89265}Well, well. Look who's here.
{89274}{89329}You two shopping for your new|dream home?
{89334}{89437}Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?|Don't your family sleep in one room?
{89442}{89519}- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.|- Not very friendly.
{89526}{89649}Boys, I think it's time we teach|Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
{89654}{89736}- Hope you don't mean yourself.|- How dare you talk to me!
{89740}{89788}You filthy little mudblood!
{89889}{89926}Who is that?
{90075}{90132}- Don't stand there! Do something!|- What?
{90607}{90662}What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
{90757}{90791}Get out of the way!
{90795}{90834}Move!
{90845}{90917}Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
{91007}{91054}Harry!
{91058}{91155}Bloody hell, Harry.|That was not funny.
{91183}{91261}Those weasels! Never told me|about any Marauder's Map.
{91266}{91348}He won't keep it. He'll turn it over|to Professor McGonagall.
{91354}{91449}- Aren't you?|- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
{91453}{91513}Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
{91518}{91573}- Ron fancies her.|- That's not true!
{91577}{91622}- Professor McGonagall!|- Cornelius!
{91626}{91659}Allow me, minister.
{91664}{91708}- Oh, Hagrid...|- Sorry about that.
{91713}{91783}Rosmerta, my dear.|I hope business is good.
{91788}{91881}It'd be a lot better if the Ministry|wasn't sending dementors...
{91885}{91982}...into my pub every other night!|- We have...
{91992}{92069}- We have a killer on the loose.|- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
{92077}{92136}And what would bring him here?
{92140}{92240}- Harry Potter.|- Harry Potter?
{92244}{92286}Come.
{92347}{92395}Harry!
{92580}{92687}- No underage wizards allowed in today!|- Shut the damn door!
{92692}{92740}- So rude.|- Thick heads.
{92746}{92784}- Thick heads?!|- How dare they!
{92789}{92865}- Who are they calling thick heads?|- Young whippersnappers!
{92883}{92977}Nobody will come to a pub where|they'll get scared out of their wits.
{92981}{93075}Professor Dumbledore doesn't want|dementors around the place.
{93142}{93185}Tell me what this is all about.
{93189}{93296}Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents|realized they were marked for death...
{93300}{93364}Remember? They hid.|Few knew where they were.
{93369}{93461}One who did was Sirius Black.|And he told You-Know-Who.
{93466}{93543}Not only did Black lead him|to the Potters that night...
{93547}{93628}...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
{93634}{93686}- Peter Pettigrew?|- Little lump of a boy.
{93690}{93744}- Always trailing after Black.|- I remember.
{93748}{93792}Never let James and Sirius|out of his sight.
{93796}{93862}- What happened?|- Peter tried to warn the Potters...
{93866}{93966}...and might have, had he not|run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
{93971}{94063}Black was vicious.|He didn't kill Pettigrew.
{94068}{94120}He destroyed him!
{94135}{94249}A finger. That's all that was left.|A finger. Nothing else.
{94253}{94326}Sirius Black may not have|put his hands to the Potters...
{94330}{94407}...but he's the reason they're dead.|- He wants to finish things.
{94412}{94480}- I don't believe it.|- That's not the worst of it.
{94485}{94575}- What could be worse?|- This: Sirius Black was...
{94580}{94631}...and remains to this day...
{94642}{94681}...Harry Potter's godfather!
{94888}{94943}Ron, look!
{95080}{95142}- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.|- Merry Christmas.
{96064}{96108}Harry, what happened?
{96168}{96219}He was their friend...
{96231}{96285}...and he betrayed them.
{96304}{96351}He was their friend!
{96405}{96452}I hope he finds me.
{96467}{96523}Because when he does,|I'm gonna be ready!
{96534}{96597}When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
{96939}{96978}{Y:i}Harry.
{96990}{97030}{Y:i}There you are. You came.
{97039}{97132}Are you sure about this, Harry?|This is very advanced magic...
{97136}{97195}...well beyond the Ordinary|Wizarding Level.
{97199}{97236}I'm sure.
{97250}{97309}Well, everything's prepared.
{97315}{97396}The spell I'm going to teach you|is called the Patronus Charm.
{97401}{97436}Did you ever hear of it?
{97440}{97480}No? Well...
{97484}{97570}A Patronus is a positive force.|For the wizard who conjures one...
{97574}{97686}...it works like a shield, with the|dementor feeding on it rather than him.
{97690}{97782}But in order for it to work,|you need to think of a memory.
{97786}{97881}Not just any memory, a very happy|memory, a very powerful memory.
{97886}{97977}Can you do this?|Yes. Very well.
{98006}{98059}Close your eyes.
{98102}{98147}Concentrate.
{98177}{98227}Explore your past.
{98239}{98284}Do you have a memory?
{98322}{98375}Allow it to fill you up.
{98392}{98442}Lose yourself within it.
{98450}{98578}{Y:i}Then speak the incantation,|Expecto Patronum.
{98588}{98656}{Y:i}- Expecto Patronum.|- Very good.
{98747}{98827}Shall we? Wand at the ready.
{99247}{99317}{Y:i}Expecto Patronum!
{99328}{99416}{Y:i}Expecto... Expecto...
{99422}{99463}{Y:i}Expect...
{99511}{99609}Here we go. Come on.|Sit up. Deep breaths.
{99616}{99707}It's all right. I didn't expect you|to do it the first time.
{99717}{99840}That would have been remarkable.|Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
{99860}{99929}- That's one nasty dementor.|- Oh, no, no, no.
{99934}{100000}That was a boggart, Harry.|A boggart.
{100004}{100080}The real thing would be worse.|Much, much worse.
{100084}{100147}As a matter of interest,|what were you thinking?
{100151}{100240}- Which memory did you choose?|- The first time I rode a broom.
{100269}{100349}That's not good enough.|Not nearly good enough.
{100514}{100640}There's another.|It's not happy, exactly.
{100686}{100737}Well, it is.
{100741}{100803}It's the happiest I've ever felt...
{100807}{100902}...but it's complicated.|- Is it strong?
{101007}{101075}Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?
{101118}{101160}Just do it.
{101401}{101479}{Y:i}Expecto Patronum!
{101509}{101604}{Y:i}Expecto Patronum!
{102122}{102148}Yes!
{102195}{102277}Well done, Harry. Well done!
{102290}{102389}- I think I've had enough for today.|- Yes. Sit down. Here.
{102393}{102451}Eat this, it helps. It really helps.
{102455}{102498}And just so you know, Harry...
{102502}{102598}...I think you'd have given your father|a run for his money. And that...
{102602}{102651}...is saying something.
{102703}{102751}I was thinking of him.
{102755}{102807}And Mum.
{102811}{102865}Seeing their faces.
{102880}{102945}They were talking to me.
{102949}{103003}Just talking.
{103007}{103063}That's the memory I chose.
{103102}{103161}I don't even know if it's real.
{103173}{103225}But it's the best I have.
{103446}{103502}- Beautiful day.|- Gorgeous.
{103506}{103554}Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
{103558}{103616}Ripped to pieces?|What are you talking about?
{103620}{103696}- Ronald has lost his rat.|- I haven't lost anything!
{103700}{103751}- Your cat killed him!|- Rubbish.
{103755}{103835}Harry, you've seen the way|that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
{103839}{103933}...is always lurking about.|And Scabbers is gone.
{103937}{104006}Well, maybe you should|take better care of your pets!
{104010}{104060}- Your cat killed him!|- Did not.
{104064}{104100}- Did.|- Didn't.
{104149}{104212}How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
{104216}{104295}Well, first off, the committee members|took turns...
{104299}{104363}...talking about why we were there.
{104408}{104472}I got up and did my piece.|Said how Buckbeak...
{104476}{104547}...was a good hippogriff,|always cleaned his feathers.
{104552}{104625}And then Lucius Malfoy got up.|Well, you can imagine.
{104629}{104706}He said Buckbeak was a deadly|and dangerous creature...
{104710}{104783}...who would kill you|as soon as look at you.
{104788}{104831}And then?
{104848}{104913}And then he asked for the worst,|did old Lucius.
{104917}{105016}- They're not sacking you!|- No, I'm not sacked.
{105066}{105138}Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
{105780}{105915}Spiders! There's... There's spiders.|Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
{105920}{105981}- I don't wanna tap-dance!|- Tell those spiders.
{105986}{106081}Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...
{106516}{106568}{Y:i}- Peter Pettigrew?|- Little lump of a boy.
{106572}{106647}- Always trailing after Sirius Black.|- Black was vicious.
{106652}{106711}He didn't kill Pettigrew,|he destroyed him!
{106905}{106988}- Put that light out!|- Sorry.
{108025}{108124}- Watch it there, boy.|- We're trying to sleep here!
{108321}{108383}{Y:i}Mischief managed. Nox.
{108436}{108468}Potter.
{108472}{108556}What are you doing|wandering the corridors at night?
{108560}{108588}I was sleepwalking.
{108592}{108653}How extraordinarily like your father|you are, Potter.
{108657}{108771}He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,|strutting about the castle.
{108776}{108880}My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
{108898}{108972}If you don't mind, I would appreciate|it if you could lower your wand.
{109059}{109102}Turn out your pockets.
{109143}{109206}Turn out your pockets!
{109276}{109315}What's this?
{109319}{109397}- Spare bit of parchment.|- Really? Open it.
{109553}{109643}Reveal your secrets.
{109734}{109769}Read it.
{109828}{109960}"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,|and Prongs...
{109964}{110063}...offer their compliments|to Professor Snape and... "
{110070}{110105}Go on.
{110134}{110226}"And request he keep his large nose|out of other people's business. "
{110232}{110293}- You insolent little...|- Professor!
{110332}{110397}Well, well. Lupin.
{110401}{110514}Out for a little walk|in the moonlight, are we?
{110547}{110604}Harry, are you all right?
{110610}{110669}That remains to be seen.
{110689}{110779}I have now just confiscated|a rather curious artifact.
{110783}{110867}Take a look, Lupin.|Supposed to be your area of expertise.
{110872}{110987}- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.|- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
{110991}{111075}It looks as though it's a parchment|designed to insult anyone...
{111079}{111171}...who tries to read it.|I suspect it's a Zonko product.
{111176}{111278}Nevertheless, I shall investigate|any hidden qualities it may possess.
{111282}{111356}It is, after all, as you say,|my area of expertise.
{111361}{111441}Harry, would you come with me,|please? Professor, good night.
{111585}{111651}Are you deaf? Put that light out!
{111773}{111808}Come in.
{111851}{111976}I haven't the faintest idea how this map|came to be in your possession...
{111980}{112087}...but quite frankly, I am astounded|that you didn't hand it in.
{112092}{112180}Did it never occur to you that this,|in the hands of Sirius Black...
{112184}{112231}...is a map to you?
{112252}{112311}- No.|- No, sir.
{112359}{112431}Your father never set much store|by the rules either.
{112436}{112539}But he and your mother|gave their lives to save yours.
{112555}{112653}Gambling their sacrifice|by wandering the castle unprotected...
{112657}{112764}...with a killer on the loose|seems to me a poor way to repay them!
{112769}{112820}Now, I will not cover up for you again.
{112825}{112884}- Do you hear me?|- Yes, sir.
{112888}{112976}I want you to return to your dormitory|and stay there.
{112980}{113093}And don't take any detours.|If you do, I shall know.
{113206}{113311}Professor, just so you know,|I don't think that map always works.
{113333}{113452}Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.|Someone I know to be dead.
{113462}{113528}Oh, really? And who might that be?
{113532}{113569}Peter Pettigrew.
{113632}{113681}That's not possible.
{113711}{113750}It's just what I saw.
{113819}{113860}Good night, professor.
{113944}{114043}Broaden your minds.|You must look beyond.
{114048}{114178}The art of crystal gazing|is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
{114182}{114262}Only then can you see. Try again.
{114275}{114324}Now, what do we have here?
{114381}{114434}Do you mind me trying?
{114492}{114563}The Grim, possibly.
{114615}{114713}My dear, from the first moment|you stepped foot in my class...
{114717}{114807}...I sensed that you did not possess|the proper spirit...
{114812}{114906}...for the noble art of Divination.|No, you see, there.
{114910}{114998}You may be young in years,|but your heart is as shriveled...
{115002}{115098}...as an old maid's, your soul|as dry as the pages of the books...
{115102}{115176}...to which you so desperately cleave.
{115549}{115596}Have I said something?
{115709}{115828}She's gone mental, Hermione has.|Not that she wasn't always mental...
{115833}{115894}...but now it's in the open|for everyone to see.
{115899}{115950}Hang on.
{115956}{116025}- We better take this back.|- I'm not going back.
{116033}{116115}- Fine. See you later.|- See you.
{117020}{117147}{Y:i}Harry Potter...
{117312}{117413}- Professor Trelawney...|- He will return tonight.
{117418}{117457}Sorry?
{117462}{117573}Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,|whose heart rots with murder...
{117577}{117626}...shall break free.
{117630}{117683}Innocent blood shall be spilt...
{117688}{117808}...and servant and master|shall be reunited once more.
{117984}{118062}I'm so sorry, dear boy.|Did you say something?
{118081}{118124}No.
{118135}{118172}Nothing.
{119433}{119530}I can't believe they're going to kill|Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
{119534}{119600}- It just got worse.|- What did I say? Father said...
{119604}{119704}...I can keep the hippogriff's head.|I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
{119708}{119767}This is going to be rich.
{119772}{119823}- Look who's here.|- Come to see the show?
{119828}{119902}You! You foul, loathsome,|evil little cockroach!
{119907}{119948}Hermione, no!
{119963}{120016}He's not worth it.
{120355}{120404}Malfoy, are you okay?
{120409}{120510}- Let's go. Quick.|- Not a word to anyone, understood?
{120514}{120619}- That felt good.|- Not good, brilliant.
{121086}{121189}Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees|when the wind blows through them.
{121193}{121248}Why don't we just set him free?
{121252}{121309}They'd know it was me,|and then Dumbledore...
{121314}{121386}...would get into trouble.|He's coming down, Dumbledore.
{121390}{121447}Says he wants to be with me|when they...
{121471}{121520}When it happens.
{121524}{121556}Great man, Dumbledore.
{121580}{121617}A great man.
{121676}{121748}- We'll stay with you too.|- You'll do no such thing!
{121752}{121828}Think I want you seeing|something like that? No.
{121832}{121920}You just drink your tea and be off.|Oh. Before you do, Ron...
{122098}{122155}Scabbers! You're alive!
{122159}{122247}- Keep a closer eye on your pet.|- I think you owe someone an apology.
{122252}{122342}Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,|I'll let him know.
{122346}{122372}I meant me!
{122389}{122442}Blimey. What was that?
{122597}{122630}Hagrid!
{122677}{122709}Oh, crikey.
{122744}{122810}No, minister. Over this way.
{122815}{122913}It's late. It's nearly dark.|You shouldn't be here.
{122917}{123007}Someone sees you outside|this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
{123012}{123098}Particularly you, Harry.|With you in a moment!
{123132}{123189}Quick. Quick!
{123194}{123235}Hagrid.
{123240}{123334}- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.|- Go on, go on!
{123378}{123445}- That's ling you see over there...|- On the slope.
{123449}{123513}- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.|- Professor Dumbledore.
{123517}{123582}- Good evening.|- Minister. Make your way through.
{123587}{123679}- Have a tea, if you like.|- No, Hagrid.
{123729}{123790}- Gentlemen.|- I'd like a cup of tea.
{123796}{123876}Well, I think we should get down|to our business, shall we?
{123904}{123990}Very well. It is the decision|of the Committee for the Disposal...
{123994}{124070}...of Dangerous Creatures|that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
{124074}{124206}...hereinafter called "the condemned,"|shall be executed this day at sundown.
{124210}{124294}- Dear, dear...|- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.
{124300}{124405}- All right. It'll be all right.|- The execution shall dispatch...
{124409}{124450}What?
{124455}{124504}I thought I just saw...
{124509}{124560}- Never mind.|- Let's go!
{124682}{124737}Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
{125853}{125888}Oh, no.
{126150}{126203}He bit me. Scabbers.
{126217}{126264}Ron. Ron!
{126287}{126371}- Ron!|- Scabbers, come back.
{126408}{126449}Wait!
{126592}{126695}- Scabbers, you bit me!|- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
{126699}{126754}That's not good. Ron, run!
{126829}{126890}Harry, Hermione, run!
{126904}{126943}It's the Grim!
{127111}{127183}- Harry!|- Ron! Ron, wait!
{127189}{127236}Harry!
{127275}{127332}- Help!|- Ron!
{127383}{127461}- Ron. Ron.|- Ron!
{127817}{127864}Come on!
{127911}{127945}Move!
{128042}{128083}Duck!
{128944}{128999}Harry!
{129380}{129452}- Oh, I'm sorry.|- Don't worry.
{129456}{129550}- Where do you suppose this goes?|- I have a hunch.
{129563}{129599}I just hope I'm wrong.
{130071}{130147}We're in the Shrieking Shack,|aren't we?
{130173}{130212}Come on.
{130460}{130493}Ron.
{130507}{130570}- Ron. You're okay.|- The dog. Where is it?
{130575}{130651}It's a trap. He's the dog.|He's an Animagus.
{130985}{131051}If you want to kill Harry,|you have to kill us too!
{131056}{131099}No. Only one will die tonight.
{131104}{131149}Then it'll be you!
{131299}{131350}Are you going to kill me, Harry?
{131380}{131423}{Y:i}Expelliarmus!
{131513}{131613}Well, well, Sirius.|Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
{131618}{131690}Finally, the flesh|reflects the madness within.
{131705}{131791}Well, you'd know all about|the madness within, wouldn't you?
{132042}{132066}- I found him.|- I know.
{132071}{132101}- It's him.|- I understand.
{132106}{132182}- Let's kill him!|- No! I trusted you!
{132193}{132283}And all this time,|you've been his friend.
{132300}{132372}He's a werewolf!|That's why he's been missing classes.
{132440}{132481}How long have you known?
{132493}{132569}- Since Professor Snape set the essay.|- Well, Hermione.
{132575}{132645}You are the brightest witch|of your age I've ever met.
{132649}{132706}Enough talk, Remus!|Come on, let's kill him!
{132712}{132775}- Wait!|- I did my waiting!
{132779}{132836}Twelve years of it!
{132852}{132909}In Azkaban!
{133136}{133177}Very well. Kill him.
{133192}{133282}But wait one more minute.|Harry has the right to know why.
{133286}{133323}I know why.
{133329}{133382}You betrayed my parents.
{133387}{133457}- You're the reason they're dead!|- No, it wasn't him.
{133461}{133506}Somebody did betray your parents...
{133511}{133595}...somebody who, until quite recently,|I believed to be dead!
{133600}{133682}- Who was it, then?|- Peter Pettigrew!
{133687}{133761}And he's in this room! Right now!
{133774}{133845}Come out, come out, Peter!
{133849}{133921}{Y:i}- Come out, come out and play!|- Expelliarmus!
{133992}{134051}Vengeance is sweet.
{134056}{134109}How I hoped I'd be the one|to catch you.
{134114}{134146}Severus...
{134150}{134263}I told Dumbledore you were helping a|friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
{134268}{134300}Brilliant, Snape.
{134304}{134409}You've put your keen mind to the task|and come to the wrong conclusion.
{134414}{134478}If you'll excuse us,|Remus and I have business...
{134482}{134601}...to attend to.|- Give me a reason. I beg you!
{134606}{134667}- Don't be a fool.|- He can't help it. It's habit.
{134673}{134711}- Be quiet.|- Be quiet yourself!
{134715}{134772}You two, quarrelling|like an old married couple.
{134777}{134838}Run along and play with|your chemistry set!
{134851}{134910}I could do it, you know.
{134922}{135057}But why deny the dementors?|They're so longing to see you.
{135061}{135126}Do I detect a flicker of fear?|Oh, yes.
{135130}{135214}A Dementor's Kiss. One can only|imagine what that must be like.
{135218}{135348}It's said to be nearly unbearable|to witness, but I'll do my best.
{135353}{135406}Severus, please.
{135432}{135479}After you.
{135586}{135627}{Y:i}Expelliarmus!
{135670}{135756}- Harry! What did you just do?|- You attacked a teacher!
{135761}{135822}- Tell me about Peter.|- He was at school with us.
{135827}{135866}We thought he was our friend!
{135871}{135943}- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!|- No, he didn't.
{135947}{136023}I thought so too, until you mentioned|Pettigrew on the map!
{136029}{136095}- The map was lying, then.|- The map never lies!
{136100}{136196}Pettigrew's alive!|And he's right there!
{136207}{136316}- Me?! He's mental!|- Not you! Your rat!
{136324}{136398}- Scabbers has been in my family for...|- Twelve years?
{136403}{136462}Curiously long life|for a common garden rat!
{136467}{136528}- He's missing a toe, isn't he?|- So what?
{136533}{136603}- All they could find of|Pettigrew was his... - Finger!
{136609}{136687}Dirty coward cut it off|so everyone would think he was dead!
{136691}{136763}- And then he transformed into a rat!|- Show me.
{136826}{136900}- Give it to him, Ron.|- What are you trying to do to him?
{136904}{136930}Scabbers!
{136934}{137008}Leave him alone! Get off him!|What are you doing?
{137547}{137590}Remus?
{137609}{137645}Sirius.
{137649}{137694}My old friends!
{137830}{137922}Harry! Look at you.|You look so much like your father.
{137926}{138014}- James. We were the best of friends...|- How dare you speak to Harry!
{138034}{138097}How dare you talk about James|in front of him!
{138102}{138227}- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!|- I didn't mean to!
{138231}{138299}The Dark Lord. You have no idea|the weapons he possesses!
{138304}{138367}Ask yourself, Sirius!|What would you have done?
{138376}{138510}- What would you have done?|- Died, rather than betray my friends!
{138562}{138619}James wouldn't have wanted|me killed!
{138624}{138760}Your dad would have spared me!|He would have shown me mercy!
{138772}{138871}Should have realized if Voldemort|didn't kill you, we would. Together!
{138877}{138926}No!
{138962}{139056}- Harry, this man...|- I know what he is.
{139061}{139106}But we'll take him to the castle.
{139111}{139232}- Bless you, boy. Bless you!|- Get off!
{139260}{139317}I said we'd take you to the castle.
{139326}{139379}After that,|the dementors can have you.
{139473}{139563}Sorry about the bite.|I reckon that twinges a bit.
{139567}{139651}A bit? A bit?|You almost tore my leg off!
{139656}{139693}I was going for the rat.
{139697}{139789}Normally, I have a very sweet|disposition as a dog.
{139793}{139918}More than once, James suggested|that I make the change permanent.
{139923}{140040}The tail I could live with.|But the fleas, they're murder.
{140341}{140377}Okay.
{140497}{140558}- You better go.|- No. Don't worry, okay?
{140562}{140595}It's fine. I'll stay.
{140614}{140661}You go, I'll stay.
{140669}{140743}- You okay?|- I'm fine. Go.
{140782}{140854}- That looks really painful.|- So painful.
{140858}{140919}They might chop it.
{140931}{140995}I'm sure Madam Pomfrey|will fix it in a heartbeat.
{140999}{141100}It's too late. It's ruined.|It'll have to be chopped off.
{141130}{141173}It's beautiful, isn't it?
{141194}{141284}I'll never forget the first time|I walked through those doors.
{141301}{141377}It'll be nice to do it again|as a free man.
{141428}{141496}That was a noble thing|you did back there.
{141515}{141566}He doesn't deserve it.
{141571}{141647}I didn't think my dad|would have wanted his best friends...
{141651}{141688}...to become killers.
{141692}{141780}Besides, dead,|the truth dies with him.
{141785}{141842}Alive, you're free.
{141846}{141920}Turn me into a flobberworm.|Anything but the dementors!
{141925}{142005}Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?|You won't let them give me...
{142009}{142068}...to the dementors, will you?|I was your rat!
{142073}{142170}- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...|- Get away from her!
{142229}{142274}I don't know if you know, Harry...
{142279}{142377}...but when you were born, James|and Lily made me your godfather.
{142381}{142428}I know.
{142456}{142553}I can understand if you choose|to stay with your aunt and uncle...
{142557}{142616}...but if you ever wanted|a different home...
{142621}{142680}What? Come and live with you?
{142712}{142788}It's just a thought.|I can understand if you don't want to.
{142793}{142830}Harry!
{143200}{143288}Remus, my old friend.|Have you taken your potion tonight?
{143320}{143448}You know the man you truly are, Remus!|This heart is where you truly live! Here!
{143480}{143527}This flesh is only flesh!
{143556}{143605}{Y:i}Expelliarmus!
{143848}{143885}Harry!
{143911}{143981}Remus! Remus!
{144131}{144186}Run! Run!
{144427}{144476}- Come on.|- Wait. Wait.
{144480}{144601}Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
{144606}{144659}Professor?
{144758}{144795}Professor Lupin?
{144981}{145059}Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
{145069}{145130}There you are, Potter!
{145940}{145964}Sirius!
{145985}{146042}Come back here, Potter!
{147621}{147655}Sirius!
{147674}{147745}No. Sirius!
{148749}{148817}{Y:i}Expecto Patronum!
{152002}{152059}Harry?
{152081}{152138}I saw my dad.
{152143}{152180}What?
{152185}{152222}He sent the dementors away.
{152226}{152259}I saw him across the lake.
{152264}{152303}Harry, they've captured Sirius.
{152309}{152377}Any minute the dementors|are gonna perform the Kiss.
{152381}{152440}- They're gonna kill him?|- No. It's worse.
{152446}{152489}Much worse.
{152494}{152551}They're going to suck out his soul.
{152592}{152625}Headmaster, stop them.
{152629}{152709}- They've got the wrong man.|- It's true. Sirius is innocent.
{152714}{152767}- It's Scabbers who did it.|- Scabbers?
{152771}{152804}He's my rat, sir.
{152814}{152904}He's not really a rat. He was a rat.|He was my brother Percy's rat.
{152910}{152998}- But then they gave him an owl...|- The point is, we know the truth.
{153003}{153062}- Please believe us.|- I do, Miss Granger.
{153068}{153198}But the word of three 13-year-old|wizards will convince few others.
{153272}{153339}A child's voice,|however honest and true...
{153343}{153433}...is meaningless to those|who have forgotten how to listen.
{153558}{153619}Mysterious thing, time.
{153647}{153679}Powerful...
{153683}{153751}...and when meddled with,|dangerous.
{153790}{153876}Sirius Black is in the topmost|cell of the Dark Tower.
{153896}{153947}You know the laws, Miss Granger.
{153951}{153994}You must not be seen.
{153998}{154086}And you would do well, I feel,|to return before this last chime.
{154090}{154174}If not, the consequences|are too ghastly to discuss.
{154188}{154231}If you succeed tonight...
{154235}{154303}...more than one innocent life|may be spared.
{154347}{154400}Three turns should do it, I think.
{154517}{154560}Oh, and by the way.
{154565}{154705}When in doubt, I find retracing|my steps to be a wise place to begin.
{154709}{154758}Good luck.
{154771}{154830}What the bloody hell|was that all about?
{154846}{154901}Sorry, Ron, but seeing|as you can't walk...
{155597}{155636}What just happened?
{155640}{155695}- Where's Ron?|- 7:30.
{155699}{155744}Where were we at 7:30?
{155748}{155791}I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
{155795}{155852}Come on. And we can't be seen.
{155878}{155921}Hermione!
{156358}{156422}Hermione! Hermione, wait.
{156465}{156551}Hermione, will you please tell me|what it is we're doing?
{156556}{156624}You foul, loathsome,|evil little cockroach!
{156628}{156660}That's us.
{156665}{156735}Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
{156740}{156775}This is not normal.
{156830}{156887}This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
{156891}{156944}McGonagall gave it to me first term.
{156948}{157028}This is how I've been getting|to my lessons all year.
{157033}{157109}- You mean we've gone back in time?|- Yes.
{157114}{157194}Dumbledore obviously wanted us|to return to this moment.
{157250}{157326}Clearly, something happened|he wants us to change.
{157401}{157433}Good punch.
{157437}{157473}Thanks.
{157497}{157536}Malfoy's coming.
{157559}{157614}- Run.|- Not a word to anyone, understood?
{157626}{157700}I'm gonna get that jumped-up|mudblood! Mark my words.
{157704}{157798}- That felt good.|- Not good, brilliant.
{157831}{157892}Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
{158352}{158413}Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
{158448}{158493}Of course.
{158497}{158544}Remember what Dumbledore said?
{158549}{158646}If we succeed, more than one|innocent life could be spared.
{158655}{158687}Let's go.
{159197}{159248}Here they come. I'd better hurry.
{159252}{159311}Fudge has to see Buckbeak|before we steal him.
{159316}{159375}Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid|set him free.
{159400}{159457}Scabbers, you're alive!
{159461}{159527}- Keep a closer eye on your pet.|- That's Pettigrew.
{159533}{159603}- Harry, you can't.|- He betrayed my parents.
{159607}{159679}- You don't expect me to sit here.|- Yes, and you must!
{159772}{159837}Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
{159841}{159909}If you go bursting in,|you'll think you've gone mad.
{159913}{159981}Awful things happen to wizards|who meddle with time.
{159986}{160039}We can't be seen.
{160119}{160160}Fudge is coming.
{160182}{160231}And we aren't leaving?
{160284}{160321}Why aren't we leaving?
{160584}{160621}Are you mad?
{160765}{160798}That hurt.
{160803}{160835}Sorry.
{161335}{161399}We're coming out the back door. Go!
{161816}{161884}Is that really what my hair|looks like from the back?
{161933}{161965}What?
{161986}{162029}I thought I just saw...
{162035}{162099}- Never mind.|- Let's go.
{162442}{162497}Okay, go, Harry. Go!
{162647}{162694}Get away. Get off.
{163226}{163308}Minister, I really think|I should sign as well.
{163328}{163404}Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...
{163409}{163499}Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.|Come with us now. Come on.
{163607}{163672}Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
{163729}{163819}Buckbeak. Okay?|Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
{163840}{163918}- Your name only.|- It's such a very long name...
{163928}{163969}Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
{164034}{164105}Come on.|Come on, Buckbeak.
{164110}{164165}Come and get the nice dead ferret.
{164228}{164335}- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.|- Here we are, minister. Follow me.
{164341}{164380}- Now, look there.|- Where?
{164386}{164466}- Look beyond the rocks.|- What am I supposed to see?
{164471}{164555}Professor Dippet had that ling|planted when he was headmaster.
{164559}{164627}- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.|- And all the strawberries.
{164650}{164719}- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.|- I see no strawberries.
{164723}{164751}- Over there.|- Where?
{164755}{164796}- Over there.|- This way.
{164802}{164866}- Let's get this over, please.|- All right.
{164906}{164947}But where is it?
{164969}{165022}I saw the beast, just now.
{165037}{165090}- Not a moment ago!|- How extraordinary.
{165094}{165126}Buckbeak.
{165131}{165229}Come now, Dumbledore.|Someone's obviously released him.
{165233}{165265}- Hagrid?|- Buckbeak.
{165270}{165371}I don't think the minister's suggesting|you had anything to do with this.
{165377}{165445}How could you?|You've been with us all the time.
{165449}{165494}- Right.|- Well, well.
{165498}{165535}We must search the grounds.
{165539}{165611}Well, search the skies,|if you must, minister.
{165616}{165746}Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup|of tea or a large brandy.
{165750}{165846}Oh, executioner, your services|are no longer required.
{165850}{165895}Thank you.
{165900}{165978}You'll find no small glasses|in this house, professor.
{166237}{166273}- Come on.|- This way.
{166436}{166479}This way, now.
{166537}{166578}- Now what?|- We save Sirius.
{166584}{166643}- How?|- No idea.
{166867}{166924}{Y:i}- Look. It's Lupin.|- Immobulus!
{167078}{167125}And Snape's coming.
{167275}{167314}And now we wait.
{167344}{167387}And now we wait.
{168048}{168126}- At least someone's enjoying himself.|- Yeah.
{168193}{168236}- Hermione?|- Yeah?
{168240}{168343}Before, down by the lake,|when I was with Sirius...
{168348}{168399}...I did see someone.
{168403}{168485}That someone|made the dementors go away.
{168489}{168521}With a Patronus.
{168525}{168570}I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
{168575}{168610}According to him...
{168614}{168696}...only a really powerful wizard|could have conjured it.
{168700}{168745}It was my dad.
{168772}{168815}My dad conjured the Patronus.
{168819}{168872}- Harry, but your dad's...|- Dead. I know.
{168907}{168962}I'm just telling you what I saw.
{169062}{169101}Here we come.
{169237}{169294}You see Sirius talking to me there?
{169298}{169366}- He's asking me to come live with him.|- That's great.
{169370}{169450}When we free him, I'll never|have to go back to the Dursleys'.
{169454}{169493}It'll just be me and him.
{169509}{169556}We could live in the country...
{169560}{169623}...someplace you can see the sky.
{169627}{169695}He'll like that after|all those years in Azkaban.
{169720}{169757}Harry!
{169794}{169835}Run!
{170000}{170037}Let's go.
{170506}{170561}- What are you doing?|- Saving your life.
{170664}{170697}Thanks.
{170741}{170838}- Great. Now he's coming for us.|- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
{172639}{172680}That was so scary.
{172685}{172755}Poor Professor Lupin's|having a really tough night.
{173030}{173104}Sirius. Come on!
{173489}{173540}- This is horrible.|- Don't worry.
{173544}{173620}My dad will come.|He'll conjure the Patronus.
{173830}{173873}Any minute now.
{173879}{173928}Right there. You'll see.
{173961}{174020}Harry, listen to me.|No one's coming.
{174025}{174086}Don't worry, he will.|He will come.
{174185}{174244}- Sirius.|- You're dying...
{174293}{174338}...both of you.
{174388}{174429}Harry!
{174475}{174567}{Y:i}Expecto Patronum!
{175973}{176011}You were right, Hermione.
{176015}{176095}It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.|It was me!
{176099}{176165}I saw myself conjuring|the Patronus before.
{176169}{176226}I knew I could do it|this time because...
{176230}{176271}...well, I had already done it.
{176275}{176334}- Does that make sense?|- No.
{176338}{176406}But I don't like flying...!
{176721}{176753}{Y:i}Bombarda!
{177552}{177619}I'll be forever grateful for this...
{177623}{177655}...to both of you.
{177659}{177729}- I want to go with you.|- One day, perhaps.
{177733}{177803}For some time, my life|will be too unpredictable.
{177807}{177848}And besides...
{177871}{177949}...you're meant to be here.|- But you're innocent.
{177954}{178005}And you know it.
{178031}{178076}And for now, that will do.
{178132}{178193}I expect you're tired of hearing this...
{178217}{178278}...but you look so like your father.
{178320}{178367}Except your eyes.
{178390}{178445}- You have...|- My mother's eyes.
{178492}{178613}It's cruel that I spent so much time|with James and Lily, and you so little.
{178628}{178663}But know this:
{178691}{178767}The ones that love us|never really leave us.
{178800}{178847}And you can always find them...
{178904}{178949}...in here.
{179198}{179259}You really are the brightest|witch of your age.
{179902}{179941}We have to go.
{180619}{180683}- Well?|- He's free. We did it.
{180687}{180724}Did what?
{180728}{180775}Good night.
{180985}{181017}How did you get there?
{181021}{181085}I was talking to you there.|And now you're there.
{181093}{181156}- What's he talking about, Harry?|- I don't know.
{181160}{181244}Honestly, Ron. How can somebody|be in two places at once?
{181880}{181915}Hello, Harry.
{182003}{182046}I saw you coming.
{182156}{182221}I've looked worse, believe me.
{182286}{182362}- You've been sacked.|- No.
{182366}{182437}No. I resigned, actually.
{182441}{182484}Resigned? Why?
{182488}{182615}Well, it seems that somebody|let slip the nature of my condition.
{182619}{182751}This time tomorrow, the owls will start|arriving and parents will not want...
{182755}{182835}...well, someone like me|teaching their children.
{182841}{182886}- But Dumbledore...|- He has already...
{182891}{182936}...risked enough on my behalf.
{182940}{183018}Besides, people like me are...
{183033}{183113}Well, let's just say|that I'm used to it by now.
{183342}{183403}Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
{183408}{183459}None of it made any difference.
{183464}{183548}- Pettigrew escaped.|- Didn't make any difference?
{183553}{183637}It made all the difference in the world.|You uncovered the truth.
{183641}{183700}You saved an innocent man|from a terrible fate.
{183710}{183769}It made a great deal of difference.
{183881}{183934}If I am proud of anything...
{183938}{184002}...it is of how much|you have learned this year.
{184006}{184072}Now, since I am no longer|your teacher...
{184076}{184177}...I feel no guilt whatsoever|about giving this back to you.
{184200}{184259}So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
{184264}{184325}I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
{184339}{184371}Until then...
{184403}{184444}...mischief managed.
{185265}{185366}Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it|upstairs if you don't settle.
{185370}{185403}Harry.
{185424}{185457}Wherever did you get it?
{185461}{185518}Can I have a go, Harry?|After you, of course.
{185523}{185574}- What are you talking about?|- Quiet.
{185579}{185657}Let the man through.|I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
{185662}{185721}It was badly wrapped.|They made me do it.
{185726}{185761}Did not.
{185795}{185879}- It's a Firebolt.|- It's the fastest broom in the world.
{185883}{185920}For me?
{185924}{185985}- But who sent it?|- No one knows.
{185989}{186034}This came with it.
{186151}{186190}- Go on, Harry!|- Yeah, let's see.
{186195}{186238}How fast is it, Harry?
{186703}{186742}Lumos.
{186746}{186803}{Y:i}I solemnly swear that I am|up to no good.
{203088}{203131}Mischief managed.
{203269}{203304}{Y:i}Nox.
