1
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,638
- Hi Wilmar. How are you?
- Everything's just great.

2
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,395
- You're looking healthy again.
- Yes.

3
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,194
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,629
It's been ages. You're so skinny.

5
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,236
I've still got my love handles.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,077
- Hi. Happy birthday, Lola.
- Thanks. Welcome.

7
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,479
Hi, and welcome.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,920
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, how nice. Thank you.

9
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,756
- Isn't that pretty.
- Come and say hi.

10
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,198
I'll put it down here for now.

11
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,236
Wilmar's daughter?
Last time we met, you were this big.

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,554
You were out back, completely naked,
in love with a guy at the grocer's.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,953
- Remember? The man in the deli.
- Oh, right.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,390
- Time flies...
- He must be my age by now.

15
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,236
Shall we go in and...
have a drink?

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,990
Do you recognize them?
Charlotte's parents.

17
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,358
The girl who was so hen-pecked
in school.

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,758
Hi.

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,074
- Let's see, it's... Hanna?
- No, Mia.

20
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,712
That's right. How are you?
I haven't seen you in ages.

21
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,718
- Don't you look nice.
- I thought I'd dress up a little.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,994
Welcome. Very nice to meet you.
My name is Lola.

23
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,670
- Give her the present.
- Here, happy birthday.

24
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,877
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,310
- You speak Swedish?
- I speak only little Swedish.

26
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,715
- We speak Swedish at home.
- How long have you been in Sweden?

27
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,558
- Six month only.
- So you've been here in winter.

28
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,871
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,039
I'd like one too, please.
- That was my husband Wilmar.

30
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,675
He'll say hello to you later;, he's
busy. - Thanks. Can you take this?

31
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,474
- Did you like the snow?
- Yes.

32
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,952
- There wasn't much snow.
- No, but she got to play in it.

33
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,750
- Everything okay with the kids?
- Just great.

34
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,471
- You've got two teenagers now.
- Yes, I know.

35
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,872
- How does that feel?
- It's fun.

36
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,792
It's going great.

37
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,474
That was a nice one.

38
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,270
Happy birthday, Lola.
- Come and give me a hand.

39
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,672
That was beautiful.

40
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,038
- We're awfully close.
- You're not afraid, are you?

41
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,555
- Eh?
- No...

42
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,554
Now I just need
a match that works...

43
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,315
Don't get too close.

44
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,638
Watch out. Watch out.
Watch out.

45
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,153
Nothing happened.

46
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,111
Too bad Wilmar. Next year
the grandkids will be in charge.

47
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,270
Aren't you funny...

48
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,352
Give me the flashlight.

49
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,270
Hang on...

50
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,716
- Don't get too close, Wilmar.
- I'm just going to look.

51
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,395
Remember, you're not sober.

52
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,870
Be careful, Dad.

53
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,748
- BANG.
- This is your day to be funny, eh?

54
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,316
- I knew it. I knew it.
- Dad. Dad. Are you okay?

55
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,718
- Dad...
- I can't look. I can't look.

56
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,671
I'm okay. I'm okay.

57
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,675
- I'm all right.
- Dad...

58
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,158
Mother. I'm all right.

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,633
Come here. Come on.
Emily, get over here.

60
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,956
Listen up, everyone.
Time for coffee and birthday cake.

61
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,998
- Dad, what are you doing?
- It hit you right in the eye.

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,110
INVOLUNTARY

63
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,270
I saw "Dear Writer, Dear Actress",
that Chekhov play you were in.

64
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,512
I really liked it.
I saw it twice.

65
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,959
- And you were so good.
- That's nice to hear.

66
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,399
Overall. You're so good.
I've seen a lot that you've done.

67
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,998
Revues, that Christmas special
where you were a constable...

68
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,835
- It was so funny.
- Yes, it was...

69
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,551
And lots of films too,
serious and funny.

70
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,189
And you have four kids.
How do you manage?

71
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,634
I don't always,
but most of the time I get by.

72
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,715
- Well, I'm impressed. You go, girl.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,236
- Have you heard from Hollywood?
- No, I don't think...

74
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,077
- Are you hoping to?
- No, I'm happy as I am.

75
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,268
It's a shock being on a coach with
you. I'd have thought you'd fly.

76
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,993
No... no, this was... the best
alternative for getting home today.

77
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,632
- Well, I'll see you on the trip.
- That'll be fun...

78
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,518
- Would you like a mint?
- Oh, thanks.

79
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,274
- This is my husband.
- Hi.

80
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,231
- Oh, I took too much.
- Don’t worry about it.

81
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,312
- So, how old are you, about 22?
- No, I'm 19.

82
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,759
- Whoa.
- But thanks for the compliment.

83
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,072
I didn't mean you looked old...

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,472
- Mint?
- Please.

85
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,112
- How old do you think I am?
- I don't know, maybe... 42?

86
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,594
- 42? No, actually I'm 35.
- Oh. Sorry.

87
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,757
That's okay. Most people
think I look younger than 35.

88
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,119
- If I'm wearing a sweatshirt.
- I can see that.

89
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,752
That's how I usually dress.
More youthful than this, anyway.

90
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,591
So you've got your whole life ahead
of you. What do you want to do?

91
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,790
I don't know, I only know
I want to really live, you know?

92
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,795
I want to try out
whatever I feel like doing.

93
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,397
Right now, I want to travel.

94
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,475
To Peru or Brazil...
I like horseback riding.

95
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,273
A friend and I, a girl I went to
school with, I thought we might...

96
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,639
- ...go riding somewhere.
- Do you take the horse with you?

97
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,830
- Right - take a horse on a plane.
- Well, it can't be easy to find one.

98
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,233
I'm sure we can rent them there.

99
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,437
- It's barely visible.
- Isn't it? Yes it is.

100
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,469
Good.

101
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,110
Show off the lace.

102
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,872
Yeah.

103
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,918
I'll raise the camera a little.

104
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,237
Check this out.

105
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,193
- I'm like, "Ooo."
- Look at that.

106
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,832
Get ready, get ready...

107
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,191
That's cute.

108
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,272
Let's try this.

109
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,879
- Like a doll...
- You or me?

110
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,598
You.

111
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,430
- My hair looks so dark.
- Your hair is not dark.

112
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,391
- Here, compare here and here.
- That's 'cause it's on your skin.

113
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,070
That's all it is.

114
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,118
My eyelids are shiny.

115
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,400
- It's cute.
- No, it's not cute.

116
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,429
- Why do you look good and not me?
- I don't look good.

117
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,434
Yes, you do.

118
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,919
Great that they're all
turning out so nice...

119
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,110
It's nice when the pictures are so
good. Hear how positive I am?

120
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,115
- You're a real pessimist.
- What's that?

121
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,400
- You're negative all the time.
- I just wish I photographed well.

122
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,120
- But you do.
- No, I don't.

123
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,149
You do too.
I'll hit you if you say it again.

124
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,029
I don't... OW. Brat.

125
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,389
You're like, "I'm so ugly.'. '
It's your attitude that's ugly.

126
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,792
- What should I say?
- You're pretty. You are.

127
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,795
- Mum taught me not to lie.
- But you are pretty.

128
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,351
- No I'm not, no I'm not.
- You are, you are.

129
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,037
Does everyone understand?
No questions?

130
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,193
Then I'll bring her in.

131
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,910
You can come in now.

132
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,673
There...
Can you stand here?

133
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,999
We're going to do an exercise.
I'm going to show you some pictures.

134
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,953
Each picture has two lines. Point
to the one you think is longest.

135
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,913
Which line
do you think is the longest here?

136
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,119
That one?
What does the class say?

137
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,512
What do you say?

138
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,555
- This one.
- That's the longest?

139
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,998
- Does everyone think so?
- Yeees.

140
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,314
It's not easy to see.

141
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,872
Try this one.

142
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,113
That one?
No?... What do you say?

143
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,715
This one.

144
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,953
- Do you all think so?
- Yeees.

145
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,032
Okay now, take your time.

146
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,634
Look closely.
Which line is longest?

147
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,117
- Do you think that's the longest?
- Not really.

148
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,115
You think the other one is longer,
but you picked this one. Why?

149
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,150
- Because everyone else does.
- That's right. Take your seat.

150
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,155
Do you know what we did
when you were outside?

151
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,233
We decided
to disagree with you.

152
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,152
You can go in now.

153
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,434
So now we're all happy.
All happy in the back of the coach.

154
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,592
We're having fun
in the back of the coach

155
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,757
What? What do you mean don't laugh?
You're laughing.

156
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,232
Are you wrong in the head?

157
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,714
- Seriously, go get it.
- "Seriously, go get it..."

158
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,953
- I mean it, go get it.
- "I mean it..."

159
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,239
Jeez, don't get
your knickers in a twist.

160
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,030
- Rile him up.
- Take it.

161
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,997
Screw that.

162
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,835
There it is.

163
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,797
What the hell is with you?

164
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,114
- Now now, chill out.
- What? You're the one who...

165
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,872
- Sit down.
- Wrestling in the aisles...

166
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:09,594
- Yeah, but you took it.
- Hey, you took my cap first.

167
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,713
- Surfing. I want to learn to surf.
- Yes, that would be nice.

168
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,558
Hang out on the beach all day
and party all night.

169
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,953
Get out of here
and away from boring people.

170
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,955
Me too. I want to get away
and have new experiences.

171
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,430
- Where to?
- Just away.

172
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,630
I've just been through a grueling
divorce;, I'd like to get away.

173
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,633
I understand.

174
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,079
It was really something.
It was like two weeks ago.

175
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,998
- Wow, that's recent.
- It feels like a long time.

176
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,835
I get home from work
and the house is practically empty.

177
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,595
She took almost everything.

178
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,956
In the kitchen
I find a note from my wife;

179
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,716
"I'm taking the children,
we're leaving you"...bla bla bla.

180
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,754
So she met someone else
and just left.

181
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,317
I was completely... It was the worst
thing that's ever happened to me.

182
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,710
I spent a week in bed - at least.
I couldn't get up, just kept crying.

183
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,719
Lucky for me I had my brother.

184
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,156
He lives close by.

185
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,236
So I could go there and eat and be
with his family. I even slept there.

186
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,918
So after that first week
I got back on my feet.

187
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,877
- And now I'm here, two weeks later.
- Hard to believe.

188
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,352
- And I don't show it, do I?
- No, not at all.

189
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,151
Do you have a boyfriend?

190
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,632
- Would you break up in a note?
- No, never.

191
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,999
- You just don't do that.
- No, it's immature behavior.

192
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,950
Yeah... I thought so too.

193
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,876
It's so incomprehensible. We've
known each other for eight years.

194
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,673
You'd think the least she could do
is talk about it if she's not happy.

195
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,749
That's true of any relationship.
Just leaving a note is unbelievable.

196
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,510
I think so, anyway.
I have it here;, I'll show you.

197
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,798
Look at the last sentence. I don't
even get it. Do you, as a girl?

198
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,954
It doesn't even fit
with the previous sentence.

199
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,716
It's as if she wasn't in her right
mind when she wrote it.

200
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,670
I... I don't know, maybe she...

201
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,709
Maybe you understand how she thinks?
Maybe girls think differently.

202
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,993
D'you think?

203
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,792
- I wouldn't treat anyone like this.
- No, but maybe you...

204
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,552
- Maybe you can interpret it?
- I...

205
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,319
- Shouldn't you call and ask?
- The medical hotline?

206
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,110
- I can't call the medical hotline.
- Why not?

207
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:34,517
If I say, "My husband was hit by a
rocket" they'll say to bring him in.

208
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:40,152
- Then he has to go in.
- He refuses.

209
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,632
- It's not possible.
- Of course it is.

210
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,396
What do we do,
drag him into the car?

211
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,277
Mother and I were sick one week,
stayed home from work and school

212
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,711
We rented lots of films, I got tons
of candy, and she drank rum and cola

213
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,473
We had fun all day
while others toiled away

214
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,636
When father came home from his shift
we innocently coughed and sniffed

215
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,274
That was really nice.
And funny.

216
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,515
- It was very good.
- And now you know the whole story.

217
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,710
- Here I thought you drank the rum.
- He's blamed you all along.

218
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,795
- You're blamed for Mum's sins.
- You're blamed for everything.

219
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,670
- I don't mind.
- Oh, that's good.

220
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,869
Damn you're hot.

221
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,913
- Come on, let's dance.
- No.

222
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,709
Ow. What are you doing.
Knock it off. Ow.

223
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,316
Look at them instead.

224
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,117
Come on, hottie.

225
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,913
Oo, porn stars.

226
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,399
- Come on now.
- No.

227
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,357
Come on, dance.

228
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,713
Shit.

229
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,515
Turn the music off.

230
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,752
Turn it off. You moron.

231
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:26,950
All over the rug. Mum's going
to kill me when she sees this.

232
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,836
- Damn you...
- You know I laugh when I'm upset.

233
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,596
You're so stupid.

234
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,709
- Look at this bloody big stain.
- It's not that bad.

235
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,871
What do we do?

236
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,989
What's in the drink? I bet it
tastes just as awful as last time.

237
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,075
- Sorry, Sara, you suck at drinks.
- No, this is the best ever.

238
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,112
- Thanks. Gimme five.
- Why are you making faces?

239
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,070
- That's disgusting.
- No, it's great.

240
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,519
- Don't break the window.
- I'm leaving.

241
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,549
- With my witch's brew?
- I'm going with your "witch".

242
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,794
Bye bye.
Oops, I dropped the "witch".

243
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,273
- What are you doing?
- I'm speaking Swinglish.

244
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,637
What is it?

245
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,228
- Johnny.
- Johnny boy.

246
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,313
Hottie.

247
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,236
Roger. Ha, his name is Roger.
Roger, you listen to me.

248
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,870
- Rogerrr.
- Roger rocks.

249
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,670
Hey.

250
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,158
Lars. Lasse. Lasse.
Hey, Lasse.

251
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,279
- Is your name Lasse?
- No.

252
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,355
So what is your name?
I just wondered.

253
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:34,119
It would be nice to know.
Can't you tell us?

254
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,592
- Say your name, say your name...
- Kenneth.

255
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,833
- His name is Kenneth.
- Wazzup, Kenneth.

256
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,869
- Can we call you Kenta?
- Kent Agent.

257
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,519
We'll just have to call him that.
So, Kenta. Having fun?

258
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,674
- Mmm.
- There now, cheer up.

259
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,513
- What are you doing? Did he answer?
- I'm sitting here.

260
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,753
- What are you doing?
- We're fucking, can't you tell?

261
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,669
- We're just...
- Is that a new mobile phone?

262
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,912
It's nice. You can use it
to take pictures of us beauties.

263
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,474
Lovely phone, lovely view,
and lovely girls - babes.

264
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,236
Loverly babes,
izzat somefink for you?

265
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,952
Take our picture, then.
Kenta, Kenta, Kenta...

266
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,670
Come on, K...
Woohoo.

267
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,436
I'm sure it will be gorgeous.

268
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,630
- What did it cost, Kenta?
- Let me take a picture of you two.

269
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,793
- Here, take this.
- Pose for us, Kenta.

270
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:15,833
- Pose with the hottie.
- Let's be models.

271
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,390
Smile now, look happy.

272
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,556
Smile now, open up.
That's better.

273
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,111
- And smiiile.
- Gorgeous.

274
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,239
- Move your flab.
- What flab?

275
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,678
- So, Kenta, young man...
- "Young man"?

276
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,434
Old man.

277
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,199
Can't you buy us some alcohol?
Of course you can.

278
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,472
Suit and all. Nice.

279
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,034
- I put one ball under my tie.
- I have it out under the suit...

280
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,275
- ...so it pops out when I stand up.
- You've got it all planned, Leffe.

281
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,594
- How is your wife doing?
- She's just fine.

282
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,751
- And the kids?
- Everything's fine.

283
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,480
- You lease your car, Leffe?
- Yes.

284
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,070
- I could switch to a new one today.
- You've got a 2005?

285
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,028
- 2005 or 2006, I'm not sure.
- You don't even know?

286
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,072
- Estate car?
- Estate racing car.

287
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,879
You know the 307 I had before
the car I had before this one?

288
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:56,310
- A sporty silver one?
- Yeah. It handles the same way.

289
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,637
The suit goes with the car, but the
car doesn't suit you. A family car.

290
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:19,119
Where you going, Leffe?
You can't drive - you're drunk, man.

291
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,272
- Let's go join the others.
- Why don't we stay and talk?

292
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,310
- What do you want to talk about?
- I just wanna give you a hug, man.

293
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,993
Now you're pushing me again.
What is it?

294
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,075
Why can't we stand here?
You're on top.

295
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,870
What the... Leffe?
Cool down now...

296
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,198
- Straight up the crack.
- Don't you like that?

297
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,195
It's all dry now.
The pants sucked it all up.

298
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,435
So your pants are wet?
Mine are always wet, but in front.

299
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,875
- Come on.
- Hang on a second...

300
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,194
I was thinking before...
Ugh, you're being a pain.

301
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,994
- Can’t we just stand and breathe?
- I don't know what you're...

302
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,914
Just let me go down the stairs...

303
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:35,191
- Promise you'll stay and talk.
- Of course.

304
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,913
What I wanted to say is,
you're so genuine.

305
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,119
- Come off it now.
- What, you don't believe me?

306
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,310
Of everyone I know, the people
I know best, my best friends.

307
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,439
- You're the truly genuine one.
- So are you.

308
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,194
I promise you,
I'll say the same thing tomorrow.

309
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,196
- If that will make you believe me.
- I believe you, but...

310
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,832
- What are you getting at?
- I mean, I'm a little drunk now.

311
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,552
Trying to distract me
by grabbing my balls?

312
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,510
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes...

313
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,317
- I don't know.
- What the heck was it called?

314
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,033
There's a priest with a grown-up
daughter who comes to him...

315
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,752
...and he didn't know she existed...

316
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,157
- Do you know it?
- No, not really.

317
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,112
What was the name of that film
we saw when we were in Stockholm?

318
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,078
- Not this time, but last time.
- What film was that?

319
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,914
- We saw it in Stockholm.
- A Swedish film?

320
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,675
- Not "A Second Chance"?
- No.

321
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,153
There's an actor
with a northern dialect.

322
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,429
- Dark, handsome... Andree.
- You mean Leif Andree.

323
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,878
That's the one.
Only it's not him.

324
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,037
He plays a priest,
who has a grown-up daughter-

325
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,478
- and one day
she comes into his house...

326
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,955
He's remarried, has three kids and
one on the way... she comes...

327
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,315
...and...

328
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,475
You don't know the one I mean?
It was really good, you'd like it.

329
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,871
It has a meaning, a message.

330
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,156
Sounds good...

331
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,550
Hi again.
Have you all had enough to eat?

332
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,512
I think we’re all here. If your
seatmate is missing, tell me now.

333
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,959
We don't want to leave anyone
behind. No one? Good.

334
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,309
We'll be leaving soon, but first
our coach driver has a few words.

335
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,310
I just want to say that every time
I make a stop at this lay-by...

336
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,996
...I inspect the coach.

337
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,631
Today I discovered something sad.

338
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,318
You're welcome to play music
and make noise-

339
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,918
- but I can't accept that
passengers damage the coach.

340
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,190
What's happened, then?

341
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,918
It's something in the toilet.

342
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,714
Something's been broken in
the toilet. It doesn't matter what.

343
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,399
I don't know how you act at home,
but on my coach there are rules.

344
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,996
- Have any of us been to the toilet?
- No.

345
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,711
- What's broken?
- Just a curtain rod.

346
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,113
It doesn't really matter what.
This is a little family business.

347
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,276
- Losses affect us personally.
- I see, but we didn't do anything.

348
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,789
I'm sorry for your family,
but I didn't break your coach.

349
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,230
No, no, I'm not accusing anyone.
I just think it's common courtesy...

350
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,954
- ...to admit having done something.
- You approached us. I'm insulted.

351
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,154
- Be that as it may, it's poor form.
- Bloody poor form.

352
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,075
- Your job is driving.
- It's pointless talking.

353
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,676
He's a total dumbass.

354
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,749
Ladies and gentlemen...

355
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:27,996
I think this is poor form. I think
whoever did it should confess.

356
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,478
I don't think I feel like driving on
until I find out who did it.

357
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:50,837
Next time it might be something
affecting the safety of the coach.

358
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,394
That's why we're going to stay here
until someone comes forward.

359
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,917
He can't be serious.

360
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,069
Drive the coach.

361
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,839
- Mo-ron.
- Start the coach, you arsehole.

362
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,593
Dad...?

363
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,510
Yes?

364
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,634
- Dad?
- Yes...

365
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,989
- What are you doing?
- I realized...

366
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,952
I realized we had... Grappa
that we bought in Italy last summer.

367
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,717
Dad, why don't you sit down?
You look kind of dizzy.

368
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,678
- Ow.
- Oh, Dad...

369
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,393
I'm OK. Have you seen all the space
since we put in geothermal heating.

370
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,873
- Careful now...
- You should have been here.

371
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,797
They just cut the furnace into bits.
Zip, zip. Really efficient.

372
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,636
- If you lay a banger in your hand.
- Why would I do that?

373
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,239
Listen. If you lay it in your hand
and set it off, guess what happens.

374
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,396
Nothing. There's a little heat,
maybe a tiny mark, but that's all.

375
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:05,157
But if you hold it like this,
then you're in trouble.

376
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,916
- What's that got to do with...
- Thomas, explain.

377
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:17,350
This "explosion" isn't even an
explosion; it has no force at all.

378
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,958
- Those rockets fly high.
- It's flash powder, it's harmless.

379
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,194
- What is this flash powder?
- It looks like more than it is.

380
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,592
- What...
- It has no explosive...

381
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,915
- It's like a sparkler.
- I've never heard of flash powder.

382
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:46,589
- It gives off light, that's all.
- It's like a sparkler.

383
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,877
It's not as explosive
as it looks.

384
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,879
Rockets fly way up high.
How can there be no force in them?

385
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,795
- It exploded on the ground.
- But it had the same force.

386
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,350
It's a burning force,
not a propulsive force.

387
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,756
- If it hits you in the head...
- Eva, listen now.

388
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,119
- ...it's completely harmless?
- You get so scared of everything.

389
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,673
And you lose your objectivity.

390
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,391
- Objectivity? I don't think...
- Darling...

391
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,714
I've been doing this since I was
a kid. It's not dangerous at all.

392
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,918
- Axel, stop. Slow down, what is it?
- I'll deal with this.

393
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,198
You calm down now.

394
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,036
Stay there now.
Take it easy.

395
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,830
- Ulf, go easy on him.
- I said I'd deal with this.

396
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,638
What kind of nonsense is this.
I said I wanted no trouble.

397
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,270
No. I said calm down.

398
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:55,194
A historic moment.
Shit, he's nervous.

399
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

400
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,599
Good one.

401
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,836
Did you forget
to hold your nose, Leif?

402
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,393
- You work with natural medicine?
- Yeah, and I have a new method.

403
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:23,875
- You suck toxins out of the body.
- Sounds environmentally friendly.

404
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,752
Either you use the old-fashioned
scraper, or you suck it out.

405
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,753
- It's fantastic.
- The false chocolate inspector...

406
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,074
No, really.
I'm going to do some suction.

407
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:53,998
You want some suction?
It's perfect, you've got it out.

408
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,679
Get off now. Shit.

409
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,756
I'll piss on you.
Leffe, for god's sake.

410
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,038
- I've sucked on all these guys.
- Oh, great.

411
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,874
Doctor Dick takes the instrument...
he sucks...

412
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,511
My trousers fell down.

413
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,875
- Are you okay?
- I pulled a muscle in my groin.

414
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,313
Great, guys...

415
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,956
- Leffe runs like a dog.
- Or a Duracell bunny.

416
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,195
I have no energy.

417
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:07,471
- You're going to get sucked.
- What are you doing?

418
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,234
Olle, come on now.
Just lie down.

419
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,670
- Come on, guys...
- Don't leave before the bell.

420
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,989
- No tickling.
- Okay, okay.

421
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,276
Down with the fly.

422
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,353
I swear, I'm going to hurt you.
Knock it off.

423
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,272
Let go of me, damn it.
Leave my dick alone.

424
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,468
If you touch me once more,
you're going to regret it.

425
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,633
You fucking sicko.

426
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,796
There.

427
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,274
Olle, come on...

428
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,592
It was just a joke, Olle.

429
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,917
Olle, come on, it's just saliva.

430
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,759
Olle.

431
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,948
You can't be pissed off about that,
we've done... Hey...

432
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,788
Olle, wait.

433
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,511
- What the...
- He was laughing, wasn't he?

434
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,357
You were next to him,
he was laughing, right?

435
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,158
Hey...
Exactly what are your plans now?

436
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:48,717
- What do you mean?
- You stop the engine and get out?

437
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,829
- Are we meant to just sit here?
- What part don't you understand?

438
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,916
- We stay until someone confesses.
- How long do you plan to wait?

439
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,119
That's up to whoever did this.

440
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:17,237
- I don't get this...
- What exactly don't you get?

441
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:24,988
I think you're overreacting,
considering what actually happened.

442
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:32,191
I know exactly what's happened,
but I have to put my foot down.

443
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:39,436
- "Put your foot down" - absurd.
- Next time, say the toilet floods.

444
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:46,438
You understand, don't you?
Is it really so much to ask? Is it?

445
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,195
There's nothing strange about it.

446
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,955
Hmph. I don't know.

447
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,950
Normally I'd care about a ferry
timetable, but my hands are tied.

448
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,910
Isn't it your responsibility
to get us there on time?

449
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,117
Normally,
unless a situation occurs.

450
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,478
- So you take responsibility?
- This is silly. Can't you...

451
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,589
What's your name?
I want to speak to your boss.

452
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,756
It won't help you. I'm Henrik and
my brother and I own this company.

453
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,391
He's out of the country,
so you'll have to talk to me.

454
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,872
- So you're the boss?
- You can say that.

455
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,797
I'll pay you for the curtain rod,
say 300 kronor, and let's drop this.

456
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,353
It probably costs more,
but this isn't about money.

457
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:14,279
Great. If it's not about money,
call a cab so I can make my ferry.

458
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,479
Should I pay
for all the passengers then?

459
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,512
- I can't just drop this now.
- You've blown it out of proportion.

460
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,437
I understand you're frustrated.
So am I. I'm sorry.

461
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,678
This is how it's going to be.

462
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,395
Come on...

463
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,270
- Nooo...
- Yeees.

464
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,468
Come on, honey.

465
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,397
I don't feel great either, but you
don't see me lying on the ground -

466
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,510
- and being sick all over.
Come on now. I mean it.

467
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,312
It's no fun for me to stand here
watching you feel sick.

468
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,871
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

469
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,273
- Hello. Wake up.
- Leave me alone.

470
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,273
Come ON.

471
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,671
- Do you want me to drag you?
- Nooo...

472
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,240
- Come on, take my arm.
- Ow ow. I'm coming.

473
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,275
Now.

474
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,156
You smell awful.

475
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,270
Come. Sit down.

476
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:36,155
...now I'm just wondering
what happened...

477
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,348
...my son came home
bleeding from the ear...

478
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,432
...he was goofing off...

479
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,473
...with the woodworking teacher...

480
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,951
...are there any witnesses...

481
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:01,231
...why didn't this teacher
come and talk to me about this...

482
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,230
We need privacy to talk about this.

483
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,837
I suggest we go to another room...

484
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,753
Do you know how old she is?

485
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,353
- 45?
- 37. She looks 50.

486
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,034
But it's hardly strange.

487
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,433
- She has Axel and the twins.
- And she's all alone.

488
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,072
- Oh, poor woman.
- It's harsh.

489
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,990
I had them for two years, the twins.
It was horrible.

490
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,030
That's where I got my grey hairs.
God, they were a pain.

491
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:25,270
One day I sent one of them out.
And she called me that night.

492
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,273
Absolutely furious.
She hollered so much.

493
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,073
Practically hysterical. I'd only
had him sit in the hall a half-hour.

494
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:45,356
You know what Axel did last week?
He refused to do orienteering.

495
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,154
I spoke sharply to him, and he ran
off and ruined all the checkpoints.

496
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,872
I still haven't found them.

497
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,910
When I called her that night,
she said, "Not my boy.'. '

498
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,313
- "Not my boy.'. '
- Is she on disability?

499
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,120
- I think she worked in healthcare.
- I heard she did piercing.

500
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:26,392
Isn't it kind of beside the point to
talk about what the mother does?

501
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:32,556
There's a pupil in trouble;
shouldn't we talk about that?

502
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,678
We're only saying
the mother has her hands full.

503
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:44,109
That's beside the point.
A child has been hurt at our school.

504
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,913
Isn't it up to us to find out why?
He shouldn't feel vulnerable here.

505
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:56,438
Ulf. I don't get it.
I saw what happened in the corridor.

506
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,435
What you did crossed every line.
You should never do that to a pupil.

507
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:12,717
I'm talking about abuse and you're
babbling about the mother's work.

508
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,156
I don't understand.

509
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,392
I forgot my calendar,
may I see yours?

510
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,869
Let's see...

511
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,677
What's your problem?

512
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,351
- I want an apology.
- You keep saying that.

513
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,991
You want an apology?
What should I say?

514
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,675
Think about what you did.

515
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:12,678
Ulf. What I did was because
you mistreated a pupil.

516
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,230
- In your opinion.
- Even if he's a troublemaker...

517
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,520
...you talk to the deputy headmaster
or the other teachers.

518
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,913
Taking it upon yourself
to punish a pupil is not acceptable.

519
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:34,839
It wasn’t punishment, it was a
reprimand for not following orders.

520
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,551
Do you think
such "reprimands" are okay?

521
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,793
Yes, I do.
Axel is a little terrorist.

522
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,557
He's a danger to himself,
his friends and his environment.

523
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,951
He has no concept
of self-control.

524
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:59,070
This is woodworking, do you know
how many dangerous things there are?

525
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,031
Do you know what a hammer can do?
A knife? A saw? They're dangerous.

526
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,751
Axel is a danger to himself
and others.

527
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,917
You can't mean that.
There must be ways to keep him...

528
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:23,269
You can talk to him. Maybe he should
take sewing instead.

529
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,069
Right, put a needle
in that boy's hand...

530
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:33,429
No, look, we're not going to get
anywhere with this discussion.

531
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,674
- No, we're not, but...
- I think you need to do something.

532
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:45,473
Either you report me, or you drop it
and apologize and we forget it.

533
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:53,433
And let me deal with the staff,
so you don't have problems.

534
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:59,038
You will have problems with this
staff if you don't straighten up.

535
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,115
You can't just
hang someone out to dry like that.

536
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:10,879
It doesn't work that way.
Unless you set an example first.

537
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,912
If I blow up because I can't handle
a situation, it's my responsibility.

538
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,992
But you talk to me.

539
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:26,872
- You're not taking responsibility.
- Well, report me, then.

540
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:32,194
- I will.
- I only gave him a reprimand.

541
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,672
I showed him physically
that there are boundaries.

542
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:43,518
- A boy needs that.
- That means you crossed the line.

543
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,717
- I did not.
- You did.

544
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:53,228
If so, I want to hear it
from my superiors.

545
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,872
Fine. If you need that lesson,
then I'll just have to report you.

546
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,272
- Do that. And apologize.
- No.

547
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,035
Then there's nothing more to say.
Is there?

548
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:12,115
- This is absurd...
- Good luck. And watch your back.

549
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,309
Who the hell is that?

550
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,278
- It's a babe, right?
- You think?

551
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,396
She rocks a little when she walks.

552
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:02,075
- Why is she coming this way?
- Isn't that Vera?

553
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,517
- Isn't it?
- Is it?

554
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,990
Yeah, that's Vera... Olle's wife.

555
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,554
I'm 100% sure.

556
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,151
No, hang on...

557
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,153
- Is that really Vera?
- Yes, it's Vera.

558
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,915
Goddammit.

559
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,710
- Are you disappointed?
- Disappointed? It's weird.

560
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,432
You call in the middle of the night,
in tears, asking me to come.

561
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:46,391
I drove for two hours to get you,
and now you want to stay.

562
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,316
- It's very strange.
- I know.

563
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:57,352
- If we don't talk now we never will.
- There's no discussion. It's sick.

564
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:03,557
They held you down
and sucked your dick.

565
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,278
How can you feel okay
about them being down there?

566
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,719
- It's not okay.
- No, it's not.

567
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,113
And you want to stay with them
at the chalet.

568
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,272
- Okay. Drive.
- Don't do this for me.

569
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,912
You've changed your mind
because of what I've been saying.

570
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:38,154
I haven't changed my mind.
Well, once...

571
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,075
At least three times.
First when you called me-

572
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:49,349
- then you wanted to stay, and now
you want to go home. Three times.

573
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,593
Look there.

574
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,271
Mama's little girl,
what happened?

575
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,037
Her mother is going to freak out.
She's totally wasted.

576
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:17,036
- Mama's little girl.
- Linnea, wake up and join the fun.

577
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,313
That's it, smile for the camera.

578
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,439
- There.
- Let's see.

579
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:33,594
"Lay down, bitch,
and everything will be all right."

580
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:40,597
- She's doing push-ups.
- How about a dance?

581
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:46,551
- Linnea, I want to dance with you.
- "I want to dance with you, too."

582
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,039
This is so sick. Come on.

583
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,073
- Take a picture.
- Look at her.

584
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,038
Hey, put her down,
can't you see she's sick?

585
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,193
- She didn't say anything.
- Well she is.

586
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:14,150
- Don't be such a grouch.
- I'm happy as a lark.

587
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,710
Killjoy.

588
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,236
Let's see...

589
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,790
Watch this car.

590
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,588
Stupid.

591
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:39,197
You just had to do it...

592
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,793
What happened?

593
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,637
- Here he comes.
- What happened?

594
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,991
- You're in for it now.
- Shut up now.

595
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,755
Will you shut up.

596
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:19,839
Which one of you arseholes
threw something on my car?

597
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,837
- Did you throw something? I didn't.
- Oh, don't play dumb.

598
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,314
- I don't underst...
- I've got a huge dent in my roof.

599
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:36,156
- I don't know what you mean.
- We'd tell you if we’d done it.

600
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:41,189
Who else could it be?
Someone threw something on my car.

601
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,831
- Right, someone...
- Maybe it was one of your cans.

602
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,437
- Arseholes...
- I'm sorry if something happened...

603
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:56,835
You threw something on my car.
I want compensation.

604
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,757
You're in deep shit
if I find one of your cans here.

605
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,271
But we didn't do anything.
Why should we compensate him?

606
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,510
Shit.

607
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,837
Damn kids.

608
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,073
Let go of me.

609
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:31,996
What have I done?

610
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,631
- Let me go, you perv.
- Let go of her, damn it.

611
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,393
Hello? Are you all right?

612
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:37,469
- So what, is he gay or something?
- Eh? Leffe? Hell no.

613
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,792
No, no, he's married.
It's not that.

614
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:50,548
It... it's like... we did stuff like
that... or we didn't do stuff...

615
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,352
- Stuff like that happened before.
- When?

616
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,275
I don't know...
like, ten years ago...

617
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:08,275
- I mean, it wasn’t all the time...
- So you blew each other?

618
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,560
"Blew each other"...
that sounds so harsh.

619
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:20,876
We were just drunk. It happened,
once, that Leffe wanted to suck...

620
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:25,989
- I know how this sounds...
- It sounds freaky.

621
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,237
- But this was different...
- And so... you did it...

622
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,599
- Did you do it every time?
- No.

623
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,914
- Were you doing it when we met?
- No, it was ages ago.

624
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,231
We met much later.

625
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:54,078
- So you gave it up?
- I never did anything like that.

626
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,599
- I've never sucked Leffe's dick.
- I certainly hope not.

627
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,117
- Oh my god...
- You laugh and I feel like shit.

628
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,434
I'm sorry. It makes me
feel like shit to hear it.

629
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:18,637
Wouldn't you freak if I said Hanna,
Karin and I held each other down...

630
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,272
- That's not the same.
- What's the difference?

631
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,832
I... I don't know.

632
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,350
No, there is no difference.

633
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,469
You can forget your trip
to the amusement park.

634
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,155
That's out.

635
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,834
I'm here now,
can't you be happy about that?

636
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,155
Of course I am. But I wonder
if you realize how lucky you were.

637
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,440
That man could have taken
you wherever he wanted.

638
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,998
He could have been a sicko,
a pedophile, anything.

639
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:26,197
What if he'd dragged you into some
cellar or done something in the car?

640
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:35,157
Every day I read about awful things
that happen, kids getting drunk...

641
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:42,519
...crashing their mopeds or
meeting older men. Horrible things.

642
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,514
Just open the newspaper.

643
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,956
- Are you listening?
- Yes, but don't yell at me.

644
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:58,912
Then what should I do, Linnea?
I'm reaching out to you.

645
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:12,115
Do your parents
know about this, Sara?

646
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:17,877
- They don't know what happened?
- No, but I'm going to tell them.

647
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:23,034
- I'll be talking to them, too.
- Go ahead.

648
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,320
- Isn't it enough if she tells them?
- No, it isn't.

649
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,758
- Gee, thanks a lot...
- Linnea...

650
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:39,678
Don’t think you can do whatever you
want and that I'll be fine with it.

651
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:47,274
I don't know what you do.
Maybe you're on drugs - are you?

652
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,114
- No.
- Have you tried drugs? Ecstasy?

653
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,913
- You have to trust us.
- I can't trust you anymore.

654
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,311
Oh please...

655
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,160
What were you doing, Sara,
when Linnea was lying there?

656
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:17,031
- Were you in the park?
- Yes, I was in the park.

657
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:21,113
Didn't you see her?

658
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,232
- Yes...
- Why didn't you do something?

659
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,030
- I don't know...
- You don't know.

660
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:38,753
I don't understand. If a friend is
unconscious, you do something.

661
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,348
- Shouldn't you?
- Yes...

662
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:49,595
So why didn't you? Or someone else?
Weren't there were several of you?

663
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,592
I don't know...

664
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:49,113
Leffe, Leffe, that's you,
that's me, that's us

665
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,235
The little problems
that Leffe's got...

666
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,597
...are right for Leffe

667
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:03,199
Leffe, Leffe, that's you,
that's me, that's us

668
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:07,315
The little problems
that Leffe's got...

669
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:10,517
...are right for Leffe

670
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:22,831
Don't stop. Yes. Come on.

671
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,230
- Yup, one ball...
- Einstein.

672
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,838
- Is it that long?
- He was pulling on it.

673
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,558
Careful, careful.

674
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,029
- Olle. Take a picture.
- Just a second.

675
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:01,872
- RELAX. RELAX.
- Careful, Per.

676
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,998
One more time.

677
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:10,551
- Like hell.
- Man, that's scary.

678
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,679
Olle, smell this.

679
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,596
No pictures, Olle.

680
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:36,118
- No goddamn pictures.
- I've put it away.

681
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,158
No goddamn pictures.

682
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:41,311
- Come on.
- I said I'm sorry.

683
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:46,395
- Put the camera away.
- I've already done it.

684
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:52,718
- Olle. Olle.
- Cool it, it's gone.

685
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,433
- Gunilla...
- Oh my gosh, I'm late.

686
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:17,799
- Where were you on Friday?
- Working on my boat.

687
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,429
Thanks.

688
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:53,995
I've heard that
if there are worms in apples...

689
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:59,475
- ...it's actually good for you.
- Gross.

690
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:04,714
- It's extra protein.
- I was going to say fiber.

691
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:11,228
- Is it the worms or the wormholes?
- It's the worms that are healthy.

692
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:16,190
If you have a wormy apple,
with lots of little holes -

693
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:21,434
- and just eat it
without looking for the worms...

694
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:28,675
- ...I don't think they taste bad.
- They just melt into the apple.

695
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,709
- Were you fed worms as a kid?
- I ate them willingly.

696
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,271
- I even ate a slow-worm once.
- No. Why?

697
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,831
- To impress three girls.
- But they're this thick.

698
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,791
I put it in my mouth, and the tail
came off when I went to take it out.

699
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,395
No. You're kidding.

700
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,076
- You can't chew on a slow-worm.
- No, I just...

701
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:04,509
Excuse me, could you please
look at me as well as Ylva?

702
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,716
- What?
- I mean...

703
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:21,276
I... I just think that if three
people are in a room, it's...

704
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,470
...important to look at them.

705
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,518
I try to do that.

706
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:35,789
In a situation like that, to look
at both people and not just...

707
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,758
...shut someone out. If I just sit
here and talk like this to Ylva...

708
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:49,639
- ...it's uncomfortable for Josef.
- Definitely.

709
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,590
- I just thought I'd mention it.
- Sure.

710
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:00,756
I don't think Josef meant to shut
you out. I asked him a question.

711
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,277
I don't think so either.

712
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:11,235
- But it's something to think about.
- Absolutely.

713
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:16,835
- Is that... okay?
- Sure.

714
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,878
I can...

715
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:29,674
- So, I put it in my mouth...
- Right.

716
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,758
- I didn't actually eat it. I...
- Chewed on it?

717
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,914
No, no. I just had it in my mouth
for a moment.

718
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:46,471
And when I went to take it out,
the tail broke off.

719
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,629
Eww.

720
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,597
- I don't want to.
- We have to.

721
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:03,714
Come on.

722
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:10,631
It's okay.
It's best to tell the truth.

723
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,870
Edvin... stop that now.

724
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:24,434
Hi. I'm very sorry, but I think
we have something to tell you.

725
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,598
My son Edvin
was alone in the toilet before.

726
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,992
He doesn't usually go alone,
but my wife and I think...

727
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,630
- Were you in the toilet, Edvin?
- Uh-huh.

728
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:42,510
- Did you break the curtain rod?
- I don't know.

729
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:48,835
- Edvin, tell the truth.
- I promise, no one will be angry.

730
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,115
I don't think
you did it on purpose.

731
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:59,195
You just accidentally
pulled it down. Is that it?

732
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:03,032
- Edvin, was it you?
- Uh-huh.

733
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:09,196
- It was.
- How nice that you came forward.

734
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:16,232
- Next time, what will you do?
- Tell my dad.

735
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:21,235
He knows that.
I apologize.

736
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,630
That's okay.

737
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:29,238
- Oh, and we'll pay for any costs...
- Oh, don't worry about it.

738
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,312
Good job, Edvin.
Don't you feel better now?

739
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,954
- That was good of him.
- Yes, it was.

740
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:48,477
It's not an easy thing to do.

741
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:53,191
Okay then,
we're on our way.

742
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:20,875
People might think it's a piece of
cake to drive a coach.

743
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:25,875
That it's not hard at all.

744
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:34,595
I need to stay focused. Otherwise we
might end up in a ditch, or worse.

745
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:41,716
- No one wants that to happen.
- No, of course not.

746
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:47,752
And I'm fully responsible,
as opposed to a pilot, for example.

747
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:55,429
He's got a co-pilot watching things,
and a control tower.

748
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:01,311
And a computer that essentially
controls the whole flight.

749
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:09,752
He just pushes a button
and he can go for coffee.

750
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:13,669
I think so.
I think he does a little.

751
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,834
Pull a lever, raise the landing gear
and that's it.

752
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,438
The system takes care of itself.

753
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:30,115
But here,
I have to keep an eye on...

754
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:36,714
...everything.
On other drivers...

755
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:46,195
Here comes a loony.
You see a lot of them at night.

756
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:53,398
- He could be drunk.
- Or on drugs, or...

757
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,918
...or anything.
You see it more and more.

758
