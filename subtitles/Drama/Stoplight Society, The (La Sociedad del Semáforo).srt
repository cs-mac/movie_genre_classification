1
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,830
I still ask myself if I did the right
thing, abandoning his floating city.

2
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,158
I don't just mean for the work.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,431
The fact is,
a friend like that

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,830
a real friend,

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,150
you won't meet again

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,596
if you decide to go on land,

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,912
if you just want to feel
something solid under your feet

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,832
and then you no longer hear
the music of the gods around you.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,275
But, like he used to say :

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,428
''You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,558
and someone to tell it to.''

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,837
The trouble is that no-one would
believe a single word of my story.

13
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,271
It happened everytime that
someone would look up and see her.

14
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,477
It's difficult to understand.

15
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,792
I mean,there were more than
a thousand of us on that ship,

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,919
travelling richfolk,
immigrants,

17
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,036
strange people and us.

18
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,834
Yet,there was always one,
just one

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,753
who would see her first.

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,109
Maybe he was just
sitting there eating

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
or walking on the deck.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,549
Maybe he was just there
fixing his pants.

23
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,396
He'd look up for a second,
glance out to sea

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,516
and he'd see her.

25
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,912
Then he'd just stand there,
rooted to the spot, his heart racing.

26
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,232
And everytime,
l swear every damned time,

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,748
he'd turn towards us,to the ship,
towards everybody and scream...

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,797
America !

29
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,315
I lost a lot of money betting on
who'd be the first to see her,

30
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,275
America.

31
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,590
It's amiracle, Santa Rosalia !

32
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,639
What do you mean Santa Rosalia,
it's the Madonna di Lourdes !

33
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,235
The one who sees America first.
There's one on every ship !

34
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,995
And don't be thinking it's an
accident or some optical illusion.

35
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,430
It's destiny.

36
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,550
Those are people who had that precise
instant stamped on their life.

37
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,908
And when they were kids,
you could look into their eyes

38
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,629
and if you looked carefully,
you'd already see her,

39
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,196
America.

40
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,870
I've seen a few Americas !

41
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,434
Six years on that ship,
five crossings a year :

42
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,355
Europe, America and back.
Always soaking in the ocean.

43
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,559
When you stepped on land you couldn't
even piss straight in the john.

44
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,075
It was steady,
the john I mean,

45
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,198
but you'd keep bobbing
like an idiot.

46
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,911
You can get off a ship all right,
but off the ocean . . .

47
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,149
I was just closing.
What can I do for you?

48
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,718
When I boarded
I was twenty-four years old,

49
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,755
and only cared about one thing
in life : playing the trumpet.

50
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,833
I'm selling it.

51
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,958
A Conn.

52
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,676
Not bad.

53
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,955
Best brass money can buy !

54
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,838
Could be, in its day.

55
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,439
Been a while since you played, eh ?

56
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,958
If you mean for money,
a couple of years.

57
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,952
But I've neverstopped playing it
to get rid of the blues.

58
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,678
Don't get me wrong . . .

59
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,594
The greatest jazz players
blew through brass like that.

60
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,116
I'm sure they did, but after the war,
people want sweet sounds.

61
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,590
They want bright sounds,
forget jazz !

62
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,718
This now,
is just a collector's item.

63
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,711
Nine pounds fifty,
not a penny more.

64
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,237
Christ,
that's only 9 or10 dollars !

65
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,438
That horn's my whole life.

66
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,752
Okay, no-one's going to remember me
like BuddyBolden or Satchmo,

67
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,151
but even as anobody
l'm worth more than 9 lousy dollars !

68
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,556
If you put it like that, I don't
think it's worth even half a crown !

69
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
Shut the door when you leave, please.

70
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,318
Okay, Pops,you win !

71
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,831
You just bought yourself
a piece of musical history.

72
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,916
If you want some advice,

73
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,350
go out now
and get something hot to eat.

74
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,153
At least
let me play it one last time.

75
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,074
I don't have time to waste !

76
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,998
All right.

77
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
Hurry up though, I'm closing.

78
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,278
Thank you.

79
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,791
Two peas in a pod,wouldn't you say?

80
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,671
Are you all right?
Please don't faint in here.

81
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,834
It's the music that you just played.
Don't you recognise it ?

82
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,796
What is it ?

83
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,753
It doesn't have a name.

84
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,635
Only a handful of people
have had the privilege of hearing it.

85
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,195
What style !

86
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,920
I've been wondering
since this morning,

87
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,796
but I can't work out
who this amazing piano player is.

88
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,155
I don't think
you've ever heard of him.

89
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,594
Who is he ?

90
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,359
If I told you that this pianist
never existed, I wouldn't be lying.

91
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,116
I don't like secrets.
They're like dirty underwear !

92
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,239
Come on,Yank,
who the devil is playing ?

93
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,316
It's my secret.

94
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,912
It was the first year
of this frigging century,

95
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,277
as defined by an unknown coloured
coal stoker on the Virginian.

96
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,950
Rich ass bastards ! Only lose dirty
handkerchiefs and cigarette butts !

97
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,191
Never a watch, even a dented one,
or an odd cuff-link.

98
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,834
Not even a fake fucking ring !

99
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,229
Hey, look here, a whole cigar !

100
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,358
Must have been some rich
pauper at the party.

101
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,469
Look at this shit !
Damn rich !

102
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,919
They never forget anything,
except when they owe you money.

103
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,318
What the hell are you doing here ?

104
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,551
T.D. Lemons.

105
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,158
Hello, Lemon !

106
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,709
Immigrant business !

107
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,634
Give birth in secret
somewhere on deck

108
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,758
and then leave on the ship
another mouth to feed !

109
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,071
That's big trouble
with the immigration office !

110
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,711
What can a kid like him be when he
grows up ? Another immigrant !

111
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,078
Don't listen to those bastards.
Go on, lap it up boy !

112
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,870
It's milk.

113
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,959
They left this one in first class
hoping some rich guy would take him

114
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
and give him a happy life.

115
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,473
-Isn't that right, Danny?
-What do youthink ?

116
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,997
And who does the little ape get
instead? A poor worthless nigger !

117
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,316
Fuck poverty,
you stinking sewerrats !

118
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,756
T.D.was written on the box,
do you rats know what that means ?

119
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,990
I forgot,
you can't read !

120
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,312
I'll tell you what it means,
it means Thanks Danny !

121
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,235
They left that boy for me
and l'm keeping him.

122
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,313
-What are you going to call him ?
-That's a problem.

123
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,233
I didn't think of that.

124
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,313
To start with, l'll give him my name,
Danny Boodman.

125
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,838
Then l'll put T.D. in the middle like
the rich put on their cuff-links.

126
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,639
It's classy to put letters
in the middle of a name.

127
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,588
All the fucking lawyers have got
them in the middle of their names.

128
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,718
One of mine was called
John P.T.K. Wonder.

129
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,749
-The one who sent you to jail ?
-What a good memory you've got !

130
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,032
If my son grows up to be a lawyer,
I'll kill him !

131
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,751
But his name's going to be
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon.

132
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,878
-What do you think ?
-lt's up to you.You're his mother !

133
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,634
I like it, but it's short.
It needs an ending.

134
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,268
He ain't no duke's son, Danny !

135
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
You found him on a Tuesday,
call him Tuesday !

136
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,880
That's a good idea
for a stupid nigger !

137
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,114
I found him the first month of
the first year of this new century,

138
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,192
so I'm calling him Nineteen Hundred !

139
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,917
-But that's a number !
-It was, but now it's aname.

140
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,279
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred !

141
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,356
Quick,the baby !

142
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,595
Stop that cradle.

143
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,078
How can something that small
shit so much ?

144
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,955
Lemon Nineteen Hundred.
Shake him, shake him.

145
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,558
Nineteen Hundred's lucky,
he was born in shit !

146
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,918
Thanks Danny?

147
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,038
Thanks Danny?

148
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,718
It was like
the second coming of Christ.

149
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,237
Maybe it was,with all the miracles
that kid had up his sleeve.

150
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,756
Hell, he did everything on the water
but walk.

151
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,878
And l heard that he'd done that too.

152
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,828
And that's how
little Nineteen Hundred grew up

153
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,958
inside that cradle
as big as a ship.

154
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,319
Danny was afraid that they'd take him
away because of documents and visas,

155
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,837
so the boy lived his early years
hidden away

156
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,753
in the belly of the Virginian.

157
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,396
Now try by yourself.

158
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,714
Push your fingera gainst these words
so the letters can't run away !

159
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,440
-Man . . .
-Okay, Lemon.

160
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,516
Go . . .

161
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,273
-Ma. . .
-Just abit more.

162
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,998
Ma.

163
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,109
You read like a god, Lemon !

164
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,035
Now put them all together
like the boiler valves.

165
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,155
Go on.

166
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,839
Man-go-Mama !

167
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,755
Right, keep going.

168
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,669
Ya-nk my ch-ain.

169
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,156
Danny, why are you laughing so much ?

170
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,950
These are the names of horses.
I'm crazy about horses names.

171
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,873
Read there,
that one ran yesterday at Cleveland.

172
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,110
Ha-ppy Hoo-fers.

173
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,068
-I'm pissing myself !
-Listen to this one.

174
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,596
-Sa-ssy La-ssy.
-Sassy Lassy !

175
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,000
And this one,
Red Hot Mama.

176
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,750
What's a mama, Danny?

177
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,315
A mama?

178
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,433
It's a horse !

179
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,830
-A horse ?
-A race horse.

180
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,390
Mamas are thorough breds,
the best race horses in the world.

181
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,074
If you bet on a mama,
you always win.

182
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,636
Dan, put your finger here and read.

183
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,758
T.D. doesn't mean
Thanks Danny.

184
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,276
Who's this pansy?

185
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,876
That's enough reading for tonight.
Too much reading's bad for you !

186
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,513
What else is bad, Danny?

187
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,638
Everything off the Virginian is bad.

188
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,595
Everything.

189
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,432
They've got sharks on the land
that will eat you alive. Be careful !

190
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,312
See this here.

191
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,755
That was those white sharks.

192
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,195
What's an orphanage ?

193
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,118
It's a big prison where
they lock up folks with no kids.

194
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,195
So i fit wasn't forme,
they'd put you in an orphanage.

195
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,396
You bet, little Lemon.
Go to sleep now.

196
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,157
On that extraordinary floating city,
apart from a father,

197
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,235
Nineteen Hundred found a whole family
made of truly unique people,

198
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,356
like the ship's doctor.

199
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,476
Open your mouth, like this.

200
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,590
Shit, doctor,what's that hanging
from your throat ? Are you ill ?

201
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
What's your name, doctor?

202
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,311
Dr Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage.

203
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,155
What a name ! If they had to
call you quickly ,they've had it !

204
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,710
That circus of cooks, sailors,
radio operators and waiters

205
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,836
all looked after him.

206
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,959
Everyone tried to give him what
they thought was a good education.

207
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,718
Even the ship's Captain, in his way,
ended up being part of the family.

208
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,839
Captain Smith, a wise man,
had only three defects :

209
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,959
he suffered from claustrophobia,
had ahorrible fear of drowning

210
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,076
and hated sweets.

211
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,877
Nineteen Hundred, how many times
have I told you not to come up here ?

212
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,996
Especially if it's to steal !

213
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,472
Put the booty back where you found it
and return to your den

214
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,551
or I'll send you to the orphanage !

215
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,753
Mr Boodman,this orphan business
must come to an end !

216
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,469
It's even against the law.

217
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,518
Fuck the law !

218
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,517
Hey, Mick,what do you think about
in the middle of a storm ?

219
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,993
What ? Do I think my lawyer
should never have been born ?

220
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,071
Yes,the storm.

221
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,237
You bet he was warned,
then I blew off his head !

222
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,235
You think of jam and bread ?

223
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,029
Yes.

224
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,034
Know what I think, Mick ?
I think you're loco !

225
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,156
I have gusto?

226
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,873
Danny, tell Pedro how I cut
that lawyer's head off !

227
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,998
The Warldorf?
I've never been there.

228
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,312
The whites would onlyl et me in
to clean the shit out the toilets !

229
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,479
Watch out !

230
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,478
-Danny !
-Run, quickly !

231
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,073
-Get out the way, let me see.
-Call a doctor.

232
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,913
The doctor, quickly.

233
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,638
Danny, don't move.

234
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,318
-Hold on.
-It's just a pat on the back.

235
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,313
Hang on,
the doctor's coming.

236
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,313
Doctor Kla-Kla-Klaus . . .

237
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,956
Klau-Klauserman !

238
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,835
Klausermanspizwegens
Frischerri . . . Kemmanschov . . .

239
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,357
Quick on the Trigger was in the lead

240
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,919
over Holy Shoot and . . .

241
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,118
Times were Good,

242
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,153
Saucy Bossy,

243
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,153
Brave Victory,

244
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,873
Regrets Only,

245
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,033
Blue Balls Running,

246
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,200
and Hurricane over Open Sesame

247
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,113
was past the post in Chicago.

248
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,116
It took three days
for old Danny to go.

249
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,038
He let go on the sixth race in
Chicago,won by Drinkable Water

250
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,159
by two lengths over Vegetable Soup
and five over Blue Foundation.

251
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,958
Dr Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage

252
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,157
declared that if it hadn't been
for the belly laughs,

253
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,676
Danny probably would have survived.

254
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,118
But history isn't made of ''ifs''.
The only thing we know for sure

255
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,510
is that suddenly,

256
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,229
Lemon Nineteen Hundred
became an orphan for the second time.

257
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,153
Music.

258
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,273
Nineteen Hundred
was eight years old then.

259
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,556
He'd made the trip between
Europe and America about fifty times.

260
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,711
The ocean was his home.

261
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,477
Sure, and his skin was covered with
scales and he had fins, not arms !

262
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,438
It's all true, Pops.

263
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,717
-You can bet your soul on it.
-But that's absurd !

264
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,074
That's right.

265
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,472
He never set foot on dry land.
Never.

266
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,919
He'd seen it from the ports many
times, but he never got off the ship.

267
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,272
The only trouble was that as far as
the world knew, he didn't even exist.

268
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,836
There wasn't a city, a parish,
a hospital, or baseball team

269
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,958
that had his name anywhere.

270
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,272
He didn't have a country,
a birth date, a family.

271
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,199
He was eight years old,
but officially, he'd never been born.

272
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,429
America !

273
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,354
America !

274
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,432
Kidnapping.

275
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,672
Charges of kidnapping could be
brought against you, Captain,

276
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,196
if one day the boy's kin
were to show up.

277
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,272
After eight years,
l seriously doubt it.

278
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,719
However, I think the time has come to
allow the boy to have a normal life.

279
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:52,638
I've written a personal note I'd like
you to give to the orphanage head.

280
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,758
Very well, Captain.
Where is the lad ?

281
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,030
Boatswain,
show these gentlemen the way.

282
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,153
Forward.

283
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,153
Slowly.

284
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,320
Search everywhere, upstairs too.

285
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,992
What's in that case?
Stop the baggage being off-loaded.

286
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,838
-Have you seen a little boy?
-No.

287
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,437
22 days later,when the Virginian
headed for Rio de Janeiro,

288
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,549
Nineteen Hundred hadn't been found
and no-one knew anything about him.

289
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,473
Everyone had death in their hearts

290
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,552
because they had all gotten
attached to the little boy,

291
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,676
although no-one would say so.

292
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,399
-Captain ! Wake up !
-Let me sleep.

293
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,030
-Come with me, quickly !
-Christ !

294
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,749
-Are we sinking ?
-Worse than that !

295
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,279
-What's his name ?
-Nineteen Hundred.

296
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,718
-Not the song,the boy.
-Nineteen Hundred.

297
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,836
Like the song !

298
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,071
Captain Smith would have liked to
ask him many questions right then.

299
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,438
For example : ''Where the hell
did you learn to play the piano ?''

300
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,878
Or : ''ln what damn hole
were you hiding ?''

301
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,113
Orelse : ''Where in Christ's name
are you getting this music from

302
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,669
which seems to enter
into your veins ?''

303
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,434
But he was a man in uniform.

304
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,197
He only managed to say : ''All of
this is against the regulations.''

305
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,875
Fuck the regulations !

306
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,838
His exact words :
''Fuck the regulations !''

307
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,912
But l don't understand what the
record has to do with any of this.

308
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,153
You're not the sharpest knife in
the drawer, Pops. That's his music.

309
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,036
The music of Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred.

310
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,320
The greatest ivory tickler
on the seven seas.

311
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,436
That's amazing !

312
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,519
If that's all true,
this record must be worth a fortune !

313
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,634
This record can make us both rich.

314
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,553
That record shouldn't exist.

315
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,031
The only existing matrix
was destroyed right after it was cut.

316
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,431
Well, this is a matrix.

317
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,958
lt's one of those that they used
for on the spot recording.

318
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,156
How did you find it ?

319
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,751
I spent a whole day
trying to put the pieces together.

320
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,472
I found them by accident, hidden
inside one of those two pianos.

321
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,030
I bought them
from a second-hand dealer

322
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,228
who emptied out an old hospital ship
down at Plymouth.

323
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,553
They're going to destroy it
in a couple of days.

324
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,638
What do you mean ''destroy'' ?

325
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,431
-Where's the old hospital ship ?
-That's it.

326
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,433
Thank you.

327
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,479
-Where are you from ?
-Liverpool.

328
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,200
-I'm a barber.
-Sign there.

329
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,113
Next.
What's your trade ?

330
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,990
-I'm a cook, barber, tailor.
-Too many things for us, out !

331
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,278
-I'm also a good mechanic.
-Get out ! Next.

332
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,199
-What do you do ?
-I play the trumpet.

333
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,033
We've already got musicians on board.
Get out !

334
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,156
Next.

335
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,358
Where the hell's he going ?

336
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,195
-What was that ?
-I don't know.

337
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,433
When you don't know what it is,
it's jazz !

338
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,158
Jazz !

339
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,993
-What's your name ?
-Max Tooney.

340
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,912
Okay !

341
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,398
It was the happiest day of my life.

342
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,951
All those people
with hope in their eyes,

343
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,318
the goodbyes, the sirens and that
floating world starting to move.

344
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,632
It felt like one big party
just for me.

345
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,114
But just three days later the ocean
got tired of the festivities.

346
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,638
Suddenly, inthe middle of the night,
she went berserk and hell broke out.

347
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,197
Now, a guy blowing a trumpet
on a ship

348
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,318
can't do much
when there's a raging storm.

349
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,439
Not playing the trumpet is all
he can do not to complicate matters.

350
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,955
But I couldn't bear being down there.

351
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,750
The same line kept raging
in my head : ''he died like arat.''

352
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,238
And I didn't want to die like a rat.

353
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,749
Damn it, I'm lost !

354
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,237
Conn,
what's the problem ?

355
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,792
Have you lost your sealegs ?

356
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
You're the new trumpet man,
aren't you ?

357
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,717
You blow a Conn, right ?

358
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,079
Come with me.
l have a cure for your misery.

359
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,593
Follow me.

360
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,829
-Take the brakes off.
-But that's crazy !

361
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,310
Trust me.
Go on, take them off.

362
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,955
Come and sit near me.

363
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,159
-You're really nuts !
-Get on now or you never will.

364
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,757
-Tell me, have you got children ?
-No.

365
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,957
Shit, they'll lock you up
in an orphanage one of these days !

366
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,235
He's nuts.

367
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,068
-Whoa, Mama !
-I see you know your horses.

368
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,198
-A little.
-Good man !

369
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,877
It was like the sea was rocking us
and while we were floating around

370
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,270
brushing the lamps and furniture,

371
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,991
I realised that
what we were really doing

372
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,789
was dancing with the ocean.
Perfect, crazy dancers,

373
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,033
locked in a joyful waltz
on the golden parquet of night.

374
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,036
Want some ?
Cheers !

375
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,232
Hallo, Captain.

376
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,274
-Care to go for a ride ?
-Nineteen Hundred !

377
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,073
Who else on this ship
would do anything as crazy as this ?

378
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,710
I was just experimenting, sir.

379
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,839
When I've perfected it,
it won't happen again.

380
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,471
For me it's a question of brakes.
Fix those and away you go !

381
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,875
-How much will that window cost ?
-I don't know, it was huge !

382
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,559
We're going to be shovelling coal
on this ship forever !

383
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,472
Oh, shit !

384
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,153
At least you know what
you'll be doing when you grow up !

385
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,276
You'll shovel lots of coal.

386
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,116
-Hey, Conn.
-What ?

387
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,398
-You're from New Orleans, right ?
-How did you know that ?

388
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,032
-I love that town.
-How come you know it ?

389
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,440
In the winter, it's beautiful.

390
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,596
And in March

391
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,118
there's always an afternoon,
when you least expect it,

392
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,239
a roof of fog comes down,
a barrier,

393
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,594
that hangs just below the
street lamps and cuts everything.

394
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,350
Like a white sword.
lt's magic !

395
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,754
The houses lose their top floors,
trees lose their branches,

396
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:36,712
St Louis Cathedral loses its spires
and the passers-by their heads.

397
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,111
From the neck up,
everything disappears.

398
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,717
All you can see in Jackson Square
is a bunch of decapitated bodies,

399
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,348
stumbling about
and greeting each other.

400
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,476
''Everyone all right at home ?''

401
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,636
Wonderful !
Too bad it doesn't last long.

402
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,791
But how do you
know all these things ?

403
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,913
Who knows ?

404
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,878
You know,

405
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,876
eversince l've been on board,
l keep hearing about this guy

406
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,192
with aname as long as
a Georgia freight train.

407
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,717
Seems he was born on this ship
and hasn't been off it since.

408
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,351
What a crazy story. Twenty years
without ever setting foot on land.

409
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,351
Twenty-seven.

410
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,039
They say this guy makes music
that's neverbeen heard before.

411
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,792
I've heard of him,too.

412
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,471
At first, I thought it was you.

413
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,915
-But something didn't add up.
-Of course.

414
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:45,950
I thought : ''If he's Nineteen Hundred
how could he know New Orleans ?''

415
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,829
I mean,
you've been to New Orleans.

416
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,470
If I told you that I'd never set foot
in that town,would you believe me ?

417
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,475
Whoever you are,
Max Tooney.

418
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,829
Glad to meet you.

419
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,079
Hey, you up there,
we're supposed to blow it up

420
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,232
not wait for it
to be eaten by the fish !

421
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,951
We're almost done,
just laying the last charges.

422
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,839
-Where the hell are you going ?
-l have to look for someone.

423
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,151
-Do you want trouble ?
-l can't explain.

424
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,276
What did you want to do ?

425
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,478
You bastards, let me on board !

426
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,718
Bastards !

427
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,071
-Can you repeat that ?
-Sure I'll say it again !

428
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,394
You're not going to blow up anything,
'cause my best friend's on that ship.

429
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,473
-You'd be responsible for murder.
-Get him out of here.

430
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,872
-Get him out of here !
-l'm not crazy, it's true.

431
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,160
If I say there's a man aboard
the Virginian, it means there is !

432
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:25,111
We cleaned that ship from stem to
stern, there's just lots of dynamite.

433
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,748
How can there still be
a man on board?

434
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,959
If you've got proof, show it, because
I'm the one who throws the switch.

435
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,076
I'm sure he's there.

436
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,639
I spent the best years of my life
on the Virginian.

437
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,635
Did you find an upright piano
in third class ?

438
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,357
The Virginian is the only ship to
have a piano in third class.

439
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,190
Wast here or wasn't there
an upright piano in third class ?

440
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,239
There was a piano in third class,
but it was horizontal.

441
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,076
What has any shaped piano got to do
with a ghost aboard the ship ?

442
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,198
There must be thousands of ghosts
on a hospital ship !

443
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,511
Get out ofhere
or I'll call the police.

444
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,998
Get your hands off me !

445
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,234
Amongst all those dead souls is the
greatest piano player in the world !

446
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,278
A bloody piano player?

447
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,353
And were you tuning the strings all
those years aboard the Virginian ?

448
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,954
-What was I doing on the Virginian ?
-Yes.

449
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,958
What were you doing ?

450
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,875
I played !

451
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,836
Ladies and gentlemen,

452
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,719
Fritz Hermann here
welcomes you aboard the Virginian

453
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,318
and wishes you a pleasant evening
with the Atlantic Jazz Band !

454
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,872
Well done !

455
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,749
Please, Nineteen Hundred,
just the normal notes. Okay?

456
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,074
We played because
the ocean is big and scary.

457
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,198
We played so that people
wouldn't feel the time passing

458
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,715
and would forget where
and who they were.

459
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,396
We played to make them dance,
because when you dance you can't die.

460
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,918
We played ragtime, because
that's the music God dances to,

461
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,196
when nobody's watching him,
assuming that God is black !

462
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,237
End of the line boys !

463
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,708
Jesus, I must be areal sinner.
Is that it, God ?

464
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,317
This is music !

465
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,829
But it was in third class that
Nineteen Hundred played his music.

466
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,958
He'd go in the afternoons
or late at night,

467
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,078
when he didn't have to play
the normal notes

468
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,473
and his music was made of notes
that were everything but normal.

469
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,755
What the hell do you think about
when you play?

470
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,629
What do you look at ? Where does
your mind go while you hit the keys ?

471
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,951
Last night
I was in a beautiful country.

472
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,955
The women had perfumed hair
and everything glowed.

473
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,190
It was full of tigers.

474
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,717
He travelled and each time
he ended up in a different place :

475
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,839
the heart of London, on a train
in the middle of the country,

476
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,310
on the edge of a giant volcano,

477
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,315
in the biggest church in the world
staring up at the crucifixes.

478
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,473
He travelled.

479
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,315
Hey, man, play us a tarantella !

480
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,472
Tell me
how the tarantella goes, man !

481
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,068
The people getting off the ship
would talk about a strange music

482
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,155
and a pianist who looked like
he had four hands, he was so fast.

483
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,952
Weird tales circulated,
some even true.

484
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,078
Like the one about Wilson,
an American senator,

485
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,518
who used to travel in third class

486
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,196
to hear the music of Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred.

487
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,236
America !

488
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,074
Why did you stop ?
Please, continue.

489
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,715
I'm sorry, Senator,
I only play on the open sea.

490
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,235
-But that's absurd.
-Ports are land.

491
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,358
-I don't play on land.
-You've never gone on tour?

492
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,999
What does that mean ?

493
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,590
Long trips on which artists

494
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,799
display their talents
around the world. -That's all I do.

495
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,916
In my own way.
Excuse me.

496
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,433
Would you grant me an interview?

497
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,829
-An inter. . .what ?
-An interview?

498
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,235
What's that ?

499
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:26,115
The senator asks : ''What do you like
to do when you go back home ?''

500
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:33,114
Nineteen Hundred :
ln Paris l love to wait at sunset

501
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,238
under the Eiffeltower,for the
people who throw themselves off

502
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,757
and try to guess by their screams
what country they're from

503
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,878
before they go splat
all over the ground !

504
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,517
Why don't you get off just once ?
Why not ? Just for once.

505
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,719
Why not see the world for yourself
with your own eyes ?

506
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,829
Have you ever thought about it?
You could do anything you wanted.

507
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,549
You play the piano like a god,
people would go crazy for you.

508
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,554
You could make lots of money
and buy yourself a nice house.

509
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,952
You could have a family.
Why not ?

510
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,149
You can't spend the rest of your life
travelling back and forth like this.

511
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:39,348
The world's out there.
There's just a gang plank to go down.

512
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,513
What's a gang plank ?
Just a few stupid steps.

513
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,911
Christ, everything's waiting
at the bottom of those steps.

514
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,150
Why don't you just get off?

515
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,470
At least once.

516
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,200
Why don't you get off?

517
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,634
Why? Why? Why?

518
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,556
Why? Why?

519
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,036
I think you land people

520
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,477
waste a lot of time
asking yourselves why.

521
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,118
Winter comes and
you can't wait for summer

522
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,272
and in summer
you live in dread of winter.

523
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,834
You're always chasing some place
you aren't, where it's always summer.

524
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,558
Doesn't sound good to me.

525
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,837
Hold it,
stop everything !

526
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,958
-Tell them to unhook the detonators.
-Unhook them !

527
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,598
You'd better pray that we find
someone hidden here,

528
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,719
even somebody who can mistake a
three-legged cockroach for a piano.

529
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,235
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

530
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,756
Come here, sir.

531
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,993
This was his cabin.

532
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:16,462
Forgive me for allowing myself in,

533
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:19,353
but your music was so strong.

534
01:06:24,473 --> 01:06:27,226
Northern ltaly, I'll bet.

535
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:31,272
Well done, Friuli, to be exact.

536
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:32,991
But don't stop playing.

537
01:06:41,273 --> 01:06:43,229
Want a butt ?

538
01:06:47,113 --> 01:06:49,866
You don't look happy
about going to America.

539
01:06:50,033 --> 01:06:50,988
It's not America.

540
01:06:58,233 --> 01:07:01,191
It's everything I'm leaving behind.

541
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:04,584
Until a few years ago,
my field was the only thing I knew.

542
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:09,304
The world started and ended there
in that piece of land.

543
01:07:09,473 --> 01:07:12,988
I'd never walked down
the main street of a town.

544
01:07:14,193 --> 01:07:16,343
Maybe you can't understand that.

545
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:19,466
I understand that perfectly.

546
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:25,469
Il know someone who
went through something very similar.

547
01:07:25,633 --> 01:07:28,784
One fine day
did his field go dry,too ?

548
01:07:28,953 --> 01:07:31,183
Did his wife run off with a priest ?

549
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:39,545
Did the fever
take his five children ?

550
01:07:39,713 --> 01:07:46,266
-No, but he ended up alone, too.
-Then he's luckier than me.

551
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:49,584
I still have a daughter,
the youngest one.

552
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:51,789
She survived.

553
01:07:51,953 --> 01:07:58,142
It's for her that one day
I decided to fight my bad luck.

554
01:07:58,313 --> 01:08:00,668
I travelled the world
without a destination.

555
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:08,703
Then one day, when going through one
of the many towns l never knew,

556
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:13,503
I came to a hill,
I climbed to the top and I saw. . .

557
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:17,222
My God,
the most beautiful thing in my life.

558
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:19,548
The sea !

559
01:08:19,713 --> 01:08:22,102
-The sea?
-The sea.

560
01:08:22,273 --> 01:08:25,026
I'd never seen it before.

561
01:08:25,193 --> 01:08:28,503
I was like being hit by lightening.

562
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:30,743
Because I heard its voice.

563
01:08:32,273 --> 01:08:34,707
-The voice of the sea?
-Yes.

564
01:08:34,873 --> 01:08:36,829
The voice of the sea.

565
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:40,469
I've never heard it.

566
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:46,945
It's like a huge shout,
the voice of the sea,

567
01:08:47,113 --> 01:08:50,992
that screams and screams
and what it screams is :

568
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:53,667
''You !

569
01:08:56,113 --> 01:08:57,944
Men with shit in your brains !

570
01:08:59,353 --> 01:09:02,902
Life is immense !
Can you understand that ?

571
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:07,227
lmmense !''

572
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:11,272
I'd never thought about it.
I had a revolution in my head.

573
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:15,870
That's how I suddenly decided
to change my life,

574
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:20,309
to start a fresh.

575
01:09:21,793 --> 01:09:25,752
Change life,
start a fresh.

576
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:27,585
Tell that to your friend.

577
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:31,429
Nineteen Hundred !

578
01:09:32,753 --> 01:09:34,709
Nineteen Hundred !

579
01:09:35,553 --> 01:09:41,310
-All we need is a talking ocean !
-It's Max Tooney, your friend.

580
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:45,227
Come out, Nineteen Hundred,
I'm a friend, too !

581
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:49,181
Even if we've never met.
Don't worry, no cops !

582
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:09,591
Where was this piano exactly?

583
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:12,711
-It was . . .
-It was over there, sir.

584
01:10:16,433 --> 01:10:18,708
Nineteen Hundred !

585
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:23,189
Nineteen Hundred !

586
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:42,751
Ladies and gentlemen,

587
01:10:45,553 --> 01:10:52,709
Fritz Hermann welcomes you
aboard the Virginian

588
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:59,665
and wishes you a pleasant evening
with the Atlantic Jazz Band !

589
01:11:00,753 --> 01:11:04,143
On the violin,
your own Fritz Hermann !

590
01:11:05,873 --> 01:11:09,149
On bass,
Freddie Loyacano !

591
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:12,543
Max Tooney on trumpet !

592
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,709
Jim Jim Breath Gallup
on trombone !

593
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:21,666
Sam Scalisi onthe drums !

594
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:27,624
On saxophone,
Sam Sleepy Washington !

595
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:31,911
On banjo,
Oscar Delaguerra !

596
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:38,512
And finally, on piano, Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred !

597
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:40,629
The greatest !

598
01:11:56,673 --> 01:12:00,632
-I'll ask you once more, just . . .
-The normal notes, I know.

599
01:12:00,793 --> 01:12:03,148
What are you doing here ?
Take your places !

600
01:12:36,073 --> 01:12:36,903
End of the line !

601
01:12:45,153 --> 01:12:49,112
You've really got it in forme,
you son of a dirty nigger !

602
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:54,022
One night the public's not going to
appreciate your antics.

603
01:12:54,193 --> 01:12:57,947
That night, I swear,
Nineteen Hundred,

604
01:12:58,113 --> 01:13:00,069
I'll have you thrown overboard !

605
01:13:21,753 --> 01:13:25,666
-Where do you get it from ?
-What ?

606
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,028
-The music.
-I don't know.

607
01:13:28,193 --> 01:13:29,945
See that woman over there ?

608
01:13:31,793 --> 01:13:34,944
She must be German,
look at her.

609
01:13:35,113 --> 01:13:38,310
She look like someone, who with her
lover, has just killed her husband

610
01:13:38,473 --> 01:13:41,590
and is running off
with the family jewels.

611
01:13:41,753 --> 01:13:45,428
-Don't you think this music's her?
-Sure, that's right !

612
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:50,666
And see that guy over there ?

613
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:55,711
He looks like someone
who can't forget.

614
01:13:56,353 --> 01:14:00,107
His head is bursting with memories
but he can't forget anything.

615
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:02,186
Listen to his music.

616
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:16,785
And her?

617
01:14:18,393 --> 01:14:22,750
Couldn't she be a prostitute
who's thinking of becoming a nun ?

618
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:27,468
Incredible !

619
01:14:34,393 --> 01:14:35,621
Now, look at this one.

620
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,429
See how he walks ?

621
01:14:48,593 --> 01:14:52,552
It looks like he's wearing someone
else's suit by the way he wears it.

622
01:15:00,113 --> 01:15:04,265
I'd say he's a stow away
slipped into first class

623
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:09,268
for a little amorous adventure.
He's got Americain his eyes.

624
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:12,585
He'll be the first one to see it.
l can already hear him screaming.

625
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:17,073
Nineteen Hundred knew how to read.

626
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:20,191
Not books,
anybody can do that.

627
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:25,302
He knew how to read the signs
that people carry on them.

628
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,146
Places, sounds, scents,

629
01:15:28,313 --> 01:15:31,669
their land,their story.
Everything written on them.

630
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:38,306
He would read and,with infinite care
catalogue, organise, and make order

631
01:15:38,473 --> 01:15:42,227
in that immense map
that he was drawing in his mind.

632
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:44,748
Maybe he'd never seen the world,

633
01:15:44,913 --> 01:15:48,872
but for almost thirty years the world
had been passing on that ship.

634
01:15:49,033 --> 01:15:53,584
And for almost thirty years
on that ship, he'd been spying on it

635
01:15:54,753 --> 01:15:57,108
and he would steal its soul.

636
01:16:03,753 --> 01:16:06,108
America !

637
01:16:12,953 --> 01:16:16,502
I went into her room,
she jumped on me

638
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:19,631
and I tore her clothes off.
-Go on !

639
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:22,751
-Do you always make up this crap ?
-Sure !

640
01:17:22,553 --> 01:17:25,511
Singleton, Lee Claire.

641
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:41,988
Hallo ?

642
01:17:42,153 --> 01:17:47,307
You don't know me, but I wondered
if we might have a little chat.

643
01:17:47,473 --> 01:17:51,102
A little chat ?
What are you talking about ?

644
01:17:51,273 --> 01:17:55,949
About anything you like,weather
conditions, anything you choose.

645
01:17:56,113 --> 01:17:58,069
Go to hell !

646
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:09,301
Hallo ?

647
01:18:09,473 --> 01:18:13,352
-Is that the race-track ?
-Yeah, you betting ?

648
01:18:13,513 --> 01:18:18,064
-Can you tell me if Mama's racing ?
-No, it's your sister !

649
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:22,624
-I think there's a misunderstanding.
-Shove it up your ass !

650
01:18:22,793 --> 01:18:25,751
The telephone should
bring out the best in people.

651
01:18:25,913 --> 01:18:30,862
I know who you are. If you don't stop
calling, I come over and kill you !

652
01:18:33,033 --> 01:18:34,989
Christ, he's already here !

653
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:41,590
Hey, are you the guy
with that friggin difficult name ?

654
01:18:44,233 --> 01:18:46,793
Come on out, I'm talking to you.

655
01:18:59,113 --> 01:19:01,422
Catch him !

656
01:19:03,753 --> 01:19:05,709
Stop !

657
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:07,431
Where are you going ?

658
01:19:08,393 --> 01:19:11,624
-Hold still.
-Stop, you idiot !

659
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:16,344
-Keep still, you son of a bitch !
-Where are we, in hell ?

660
01:19:19,993 --> 01:19:25,021
-We don't want to hurt you.
-Come on out. Where are you ?

661
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:28,344
We're players, man,
musicians.

662
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:31,108
Over there.

663
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:52,745
-Bon appetit !
-Thanks, have you got some wine ?

664
01:20:13,033 --> 01:20:15,991
Are you the one that plays
ten kinds of jazz rolled into one ?

665
01:20:16,153 --> 01:20:19,702
To tell the truth I've never counted
them, I'm just a piano player.

666
01:20:19,873 --> 01:20:23,024
-It's him.
-Well, you'd better start counting.

667
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:26,151
The man who invented jazz
sent us here.

668
01:20:26,313 --> 01:20:30,704
-And what does he want from me ?
-He challenges you to a piano duel !

669
01:20:33,113 --> 01:20:35,183
A piano duel ?

670
01:20:35,353 --> 01:20:37,913
What the hell is a piano duel ?

671
01:20:38,073 --> 01:20:41,224
It's a duel,
with pianos instead of pistols.

672
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:45,625
It's a musicians thing.
No blood, just a little hate.

673
01:20:45,793 --> 01:20:49,752
Real hate, under the skin.
It riffs like you never heard.

674
01:20:49,913 --> 01:20:54,384
It could last all night
and at the end, one would win.

675
01:20:55,193 --> 01:20:57,946
Nineteen Hundred !

676
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:15,952
If I were you, I wouldn't be
so sure he's still here.

677
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:20,104
If I know him at all,
he won't be any place else.

678
01:21:20,273 --> 01:21:22,229
I'm sure of that.

679
01:21:22,393 --> 01:21:26,352
He must have gone. What would he
have done here without a piano ?

680
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:28,868
Besides, with the war,who knows ?

681
01:21:29,033 --> 01:21:33,709
He might not even be any longer
in this dirty world.

682
01:21:33,873 --> 01:21:37,548
Someone like him
doesn't end up like everyone else.

683
01:21:37,713 --> 01:21:39,863
-It's not his style.
-Think what you like.

684
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:42,991
But I can't ask the owners
to keep this carcass going

685
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:47,988
just because someone who doesn't
exist is on board. I can't delay it.

686
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:53,910
Nineteen Hundred, it's Max.
I have to talk to you !

687
01:21:56,393 --> 01:22:00,989
-How did the duel end up ?
-It was in Boston.

688
01:22:01,153 --> 01:22:06,227
The summer of 1931.J elly Roll Morton
boarded the Virginian.

689
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:11,751
Dressed entirely in white, wearing
a diamond as big as a meatball !

690
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:15,189
Even the garters on his socks
were diamond studded.

691
01:22:22,153 --> 01:22:25,111
Jelly Roll, what's the reason
for a trip to Europe on a steamer?

692
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,345
Till now, you've only gone
up and down the Mississippi !

693
01:22:28,513 --> 01:22:30,868
I don't give a damn about Europe !

694
01:22:31,033 --> 01:22:35,390
The only reason I'm going on this
crappy ship is to meet a guy

695
01:22:35,553 --> 01:22:38,704
they say tunes a good piano !

696
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:45,228
But I also heard that he
doesn't want to set foot on land.

697
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:48,863
-Is he talking about me ?
-Sure he is.

698
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:51,422
One day some asshole says to me :

699
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:57,429
''Hey, Jelly, there's someone who
plays the piano better than you.''

700
01:22:58,393 --> 01:23:02,272
So I says to myself : ''Shit !
How come this guy plays so good

701
01:23:02,433 --> 01:23:06,745
when he doesn't even have the balls
to get off the boat ?

702
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:11,543
Damn it, Jelly,
you were the one who invented jazz !

703
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:18,271
Then I says to myself : ''You can
afford to buy a first class ticket !

704
01:23:18,433 --> 01:23:21,869
You can even buy the ship
just by raising your little finger.''

705
01:23:22,033 --> 01:23:23,989
Get a shot of it, boys !

706
01:23:24,153 --> 01:23:28,624
-Tell the truth, are you scared ?
-I don't know.

707
01:23:30,033 --> 01:23:33,389
Why a duel ?
What happens when you have a duel ?

708
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:43,505
It seemed like he
really didn't care much.

709
01:23:43,673 --> 01:23:47,632
Like he didn't even understand it.
But he was curious.

710
01:23:47,793 --> 01:23:51,263
He wanted to hear how the devil
the inventor of jazz played.

711
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:54,470
He really believed
that the guy invented jazz.

712
01:23:54,633 --> 01:23:57,750
I believe he thought
that he could learn something new.

713
01:23:57,913 --> 01:24:01,269
That's just how he was,
a bit like old Danny.

714
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:03,993
He didn't have any sporting sense.

715
01:24:04,153 --> 01:24:07,862
He didn't give a damn who won,
it was the rest that amazed him.

716
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:37,548
It's true !

717
01:25:56,233 --> 01:26:00,590
I believe you're sitting in my seat.

718
01:26:11,513 --> 01:26:15,472
-You're the one that invented jazz ?
-That's what they say.

719
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:23,432
And you're the one who can't play
unless the ocean's under your ass ?

720
01:26:23,593 --> 01:26:25,663
That's what I say.

721
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:28,623
Jelly Roll Morton didn't play,
he caressed those notes.

722
01:27:28,793 --> 01:27:32,832
It was like a slip
sliding down a woman's body.

723
01:27:32,993 --> 01:27:36,508
His hands were butterflies,
so light.

724
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:44,185
He started off in the brothels in New
Orleans, learning to stroke the keys.

725
01:27:44,353 --> 01:27:48,505
People making love upstairs
didn't want any uproar.

726
01:27:48,673 --> 01:27:52,302
They wanted music that would slip
behind the curtains, under the beds.

727
01:27:52,473 --> 01:27:55,749
Without disturbing.
He played that music there.

728
01:27:55,913 --> 01:27:59,792
And in that,
he truly was the best.

729
01:28:58,913 --> 01:29:00,949
-Bravo !
-Bravo !

730
01:29:29,353 --> 01:29:31,184
It's your turn, sailor.

731
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:46,387
Go on.

732
01:30:09,393 --> 01:30:10,746
What's he doing ?

733
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:25,151
He's nuts !

734
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:28,510
Is it Christmas ?

735
01:31:03,393 --> 01:31:06,191
-Did he win ?
-No, they're just warming up.

736
01:31:06,353 --> 01:31:07,308
Bravo !

737
01:32:04,993 --> 01:32:10,784
-What's up, Nineteen Hundred ?
-This music makes me cry.

738
01:32:10,953 --> 01:32:13,911
The whole crewbet on you !

739
01:32:14,073 --> 01:32:17,031
I put a year's pay on the line
and you're crying ?

740
01:32:17,193 --> 01:32:19,104
Start thinking about your music !

741
01:32:19,273 --> 01:32:24,222
-Can I bet,too ?
-Betting on yourself isn't sporting.

742
01:32:24,393 --> 01:32:27,032
But I want to bet on him !
He's terrific.

743
01:32:29,473 --> 01:32:33,466
-You're crazy !
-But if you lose, I'll give it back.

744
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:40,229
It's the same music
that the other one played.

745
01:33:47,113 --> 01:33:49,866
We've already heard this !

746
01:33:50,913 --> 01:33:52,392
He's fooling around.

747
01:34:48,153 --> 01:34:50,303
-Did he lose ?
-Not yet.

748
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,589
Well done, Nineteen Hundred !

749
01:35:02,273 --> 01:35:05,470
Stick this up your ass !

750
01:35:59,313 --> 01:36:01,622
-Max ?
-Eh ?

751
01:36:01,793 --> 01:36:05,149
-Give me a cigarette, will you ?
-You're not doing too well !

752
01:36:05,313 --> 01:36:08,862
-Just give me a cigarette.
-You don't smoke !

753
01:36:09,033 --> 01:36:14,027
What's wrong with you ? You could
lick this guy with one hand !

754
01:36:37,913 --> 01:36:41,064
-Pardon me, I didn't catch that.
-I didn't say anything.

755
01:36:42,993 --> 01:36:43,903
Bravo !

756
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:51,069
-Where's this cigarette ?
-We'll be shovelling coal forever !

757
01:36:51,233 --> 01:36:53,269
Just give me a fucking cigarette !

758
01:37:00,353 --> 01:37:01,752
Clown !

759
01:37:25,233 --> 01:37:28,111
Listen carefully.

760
01:40:30,513 --> 01:40:34,108
You smoke it.
I don't know how.

761
01:40:40,593 --> 01:40:42,151
Well done !
Bravo !

762
01:40:45,993 --> 01:40:47,949
You're the greatest !

763
01:40:49,073 --> 01:40:50,301
Divine !

764
01:40:59,873 --> 01:41:04,025
-Did he win ?
-Yes, he won.

765
01:41:04,193 --> 01:41:06,468
I knew he would !

766
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:52,623
Jelly Roll Morton spent the rest of
that trip locked in his cabin.

767
01:41:52,793 --> 01:41:57,742
When we got to Southampton, he got
off the ship and returned to America.

768
01:41:57,913 --> 01:42:03,112
I remember Nineteen Hundred watched
him as he walked off the dock

769
01:42:03,273 --> 01:42:06,743
and all he said was :
''Fuck jazz,too !''

770
01:42:10,473 --> 01:42:13,465
That's just what he said :
''Fuck jazz,too !''

771
01:42:13,633 --> 01:42:17,592
-What an incredible story.
-Did I miss anything important ?

772
01:42:17,753 --> 01:42:19,709
-You could say that.
-Damn !

773
01:42:19,873 --> 01:42:24,424
-He'll fill you in later.
-You bet.

774
01:42:24,593 --> 01:42:27,346
He's really good at telling tales.

775
01:42:28,193 --> 01:42:31,151
This is no tale, my friend !

776
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:37,304
Sure, I've done
lots of stupid things in my life.

777
01:42:37,473 --> 01:42:41,432
If you were to hang me upside down
nothing would fall out my pockets.

778
01:42:41,593 --> 01:42:44,426
I even sold my trumpet.
Everything !

779
01:42:44,593 --> 01:42:48,063
But not this story,
I haven't lost that.

780
01:42:48,233 --> 01:42:52,146
I've decided to tell it
only because I want to save him.

781
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:55,350
But there's no-one here. Nobody !
Understand ?

782
01:42:55,513 --> 01:42:58,630
It's because there are
too many of us, we've scared him.

783
01:42:58,793 --> 01:43:01,785
That's enough. Now, you leave this
ship or I'll have you arrested.

784
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:05,232
Get back to work. Quickly !

785
01:43:05,393 --> 01:43:07,953
-Give me one more chance.
-Get lost, buddy.

786
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,343
At sunrise tomorrow
this ship gets blown up !

787
01:43:24,273 --> 01:43:25,422
And yet . . .

788
01:43:26,473 --> 01:43:29,226
-Here it is.
-Stop or I'll shoot !

789
01:43:31,073 --> 01:43:33,826
-I've got you.
-Hey, it's me.

790
01:43:33,993 --> 01:43:35,949
Don't you recognise me ?

791
01:43:39,073 --> 01:43:42,270
-Oh, it's you !
-Yeah, lower that canon, will you?

792
01:43:42,433 --> 01:43:46,551
Sell your instrument and then steal
it back, that's an old trick !

793
01:43:46,713 --> 01:43:50,865
-I should have known you're a thief.
-No, I was looking for this.

794
01:43:51,033 --> 01:43:54,389
-What do you need that for?
-It's a matter of life or death.

795
01:43:54,553 --> 01:43:57,511
-I need a gramophone, too.
-A thief and a liar.

796
01:43:57,673 --> 01:44:01,825
-Pops, I don't have time to lose.
-I do, seeing as I have a gun.

797
01:44:02,673 --> 01:44:07,064
Now that I think of it, since when
were records made on board a ship ?

798
01:44:08,513 --> 01:44:10,071
Impostor !

799
01:44:10,233 --> 01:44:15,387
If your friend really did play that
music,then he got off the ship.

800
01:44:15,553 --> 01:44:17,942
-Right ?
-Impossible, Pops.

801
01:44:18,113 --> 01:44:21,071
Nineteen Hundred
cut this recording personally

802
01:44:21,233 --> 01:44:24,191
which for me is
one of his very best works,

803
01:44:24,353 --> 01:44:27,151
but to do it
he didn't jump ship.

804
01:44:27,313 --> 01:44:32,262
It was an extraordinary, unique event
in the history of record-making.

805
01:44:33,153 --> 01:44:37,112
You can't imagine
the advantages you'll obtain

806
01:44:37,273 --> 01:44:41,232
if this record sells.
You'll become famous, Mr Nineteen.

807
01:44:41,393 --> 01:44:45,352
-Can I call you Nineteen ?
-Is it painful ?

808
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:49,472
Right, gentlemen, silence please.
On the count of three.

809
01:44:49,633 --> 01:44:51,988
One, two, three.

810
01:47:41,433 --> 01:47:46,382
Wonderful, Mr Nineteen !
An absolutely extraordinary piece.

811
01:47:46,553 --> 01:47:49,511
Divine music, what's it called ?

812
01:47:49,673 --> 01:47:53,632
It's going to have people
crying buckets.

813
01:47:53,793 --> 01:47:59,629
It's got to have the right title,
like : ''Swinging in the breeze . . .''

814
01:47:59,793 --> 01:48:02,546
You were great, as usual.

815
01:48:03,433 --> 01:48:05,788
You're going to be big time.

816
01:48:05,953 --> 01:48:08,911
If only you'd decide to
take the big step.

817
01:48:12,913 --> 01:48:15,871
-The big step ?
-Getting off !

818
01:48:16,033 --> 01:48:19,992
Getting off these lousy planks
and going after. . .

819
01:48:20,153 --> 01:48:23,509
Going after
fame and fortune.

820
01:48:23,673 --> 01:48:28,827
But if you wanted, thanks to our
record company, with this,

821
01:48:28,993 --> 01:48:34,670
you could have the success you
deserve without leaving this ship.

822
01:48:50,513 --> 01:48:53,664
We'll print millions of copies.

823
01:48:54,513 --> 01:48:59,462
The whole world could listen to
your wonderful music, Nineteen.

824
01:49:00,913 --> 01:49:02,710
Mr Nineteen ?

825
01:49:02,873 --> 01:49:05,751
I won't let my music
go anywhere without me !

826
01:49:08,473 --> 01:49:11,829
-Hey, no ! Don't touch !
-What are you doing ? Is he mad ?

827
01:49:11,993 --> 01:49:14,985
We have a contract,
you can't go back now !

828
01:49:15,153 --> 01:49:17,109
I always go back.

829
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:19,585
Miss,

830
01:50:22,233 --> 01:50:26,590
I'd be pleased if you . . .

831
01:50:37,673 --> 01:50:41,746
Miss, I'd be . . .

832
01:50:43,793 --> 01:50:45,943
I'd be pleased

833
01:50:47,393 --> 01:50:50,749
if you would accept

834
01:50:52,633 --> 01:50:55,784
this small token . . .

835
01:52:08,953 --> 01:52:12,912
Hey, what are you doing there all
by yourself, counting the waves ?

836
01:52:13,233 --> 01:52:15,872
The captain says we'll soon
go through the Tropic of Cancer.

837
01:52:16,033 --> 01:52:18,866
At last there'll be something to see.

838
01:52:19,033 --> 01:52:21,991
The sea changes colour
ten times a day.

839
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:26,112
Even more.
I could stay and watch it for days.

840
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:30,630
The peasants don't watch the sea
at all. They're scared.

841
01:52:30,793 --> 01:52:33,023
That's not true.

842
01:52:33,193 --> 01:52:37,345
My father told me once that
he heard the voice of the sea.

843
01:52:37,513 --> 01:52:40,073
Really?
And what did it say?

844
01:52:41,233 --> 01:52:44,305
I can't tell you,
it's a secret.

845
01:52:44,473 --> 01:52:48,910
-Secrets should be kept.
-It's pouring, let's go, quickly.

846
01:52:49,073 --> 01:52:50,631
Come on !

847
01:57:44,793 --> 01:57:46,749
America !

848
01:57:46,913 --> 01:57:50,462
Damn it,
I wanted to say it !

849
01:58:15,313 --> 01:58:16,871
Excuse me.

850
01:58:19,113 --> 01:58:20,466
Excuse me.

851
01:58:21,513 --> 01:58:22,468
Sorry.

852
01:58:24,873 --> 01:58:27,433
-Miss !
-Are you in a hurry?

853
01:58:28,713 --> 01:58:30,669
Excuse me, miss.

854
01:58:32,313 --> 01:58:34,065
I have to talk to you.

855
01:58:40,793 --> 01:58:45,025
-You're meeting your father,
aren't you ? -Yes.

856
01:58:45,193 --> 01:58:48,549
-How did you know?
-I think I met him.

857
01:58:52,233 --> 01:58:55,908
On this ship,
quite a few years ago.

858
01:58:56,073 --> 01:59:02,148
-I don't know if he took this ship.
-I'm sure it was this one.

859
01:59:03,993 --> 01:59:06,507
Did he have a fisarmonica?

860
01:59:08,193 --> 01:59:10,149
We played together.

861
01:59:11,873 --> 01:59:15,912
I don't know if he'd remember me,
but say hallo to him.

862
01:59:17,473 --> 01:59:20,033
All right, I will.

863
01:59:20,193 --> 01:59:24,425
But how did you know who I was ?
It's very strange.

864
01:59:24,593 --> 01:59:26,549
It's a secret.

865
01:59:27,913 --> 01:59:30,711
And secrets should be kept.

866
01:59:30,873 --> 01:59:33,307
Even if I think
your father felt differently then.

867
01:59:54,353 --> 01:59:57,265
-Move on, let me through.
-Don't push !

868
01:59:57,433 --> 02:00:00,709
I'd be really pleased
if you would accept . . .

869
02:00:00,873 --> 02:00:02,101
What ?

870
02:00:04,873 --> 02:00:10,391
I would like you to accept
this small musical token.

871
02:00:18,593 --> 02:00:21,744
-Good luck !
-Thank you. Good luck to you, too !

872
02:00:24,273 --> 02:00:29,472
Come and visit some day.
We live on Mott Street, number 27.

873
02:00:29,633 --> 02:00:33,990
-My father opened a fish shop !
-Maybe.

874
02:01:26,033 --> 02:01:30,504
He never mentioned her to me again,
and I never asked.

875
02:01:30,673 --> 02:01:33,631
At least not for
the next twelve crossings.

876
02:01:33,793 --> 02:01:36,751
Besides, he was happy, as always.

877
02:01:36,913 --> 02:01:39,063
His popularity was at its peak.

878
02:01:39,233 --> 02:01:45,183
None of us could have imagined what
was smoldering beneath his happiness.

879
02:01:46,553 --> 02:01:51,104
Then, one evening in spring,
halfway between Genoa and New York,

880
02:01:51,273 --> 02:01:53,423
right in the middle of the ocean,

881
02:01:53,593 --> 02:01:57,871
-the painting fell.
-Meaning ?

882
02:01:58,033 --> 02:02:01,548
Pops, have you ever asked yourself
why paintings fall ?

883
02:02:01,713 --> 02:02:02,668
No, not really.

884
02:02:02,833 --> 02:02:05,791
I've always been impressed
by this thing about paintings.

885
02:02:05,953 --> 02:02:08,911
-What's the painting got to do with this ?
-It does.

886
02:02:09,073 --> 02:02:12,827
For Nineteen Hundred, that night
went the way it does for paintings.

887
02:02:12,993 --> 02:02:18,943
They hang there for years and then,
without any warning . . .

888
02:02:21,153 --> 02:02:22,302
They fall.

889
02:02:23,073 --> 02:02:26,031
They're hanging there on that nail,
no-one touches them,

890
02:02:26,193 --> 02:02:27,945
but at a certain point . . .

891
02:02:29,633 --> 02:02:34,991
Down they fall,
in absolute silence.

892
02:02:35,673 --> 02:02:39,825
With everything perfectly still
around them.

893
02:02:41,113 --> 02:02:44,389
Not even a fly moving around.

894
02:02:45,433 --> 02:02:47,185
And they. . .

895
02:02:50,273 --> 02:02:54,425
There's no reason.
Why in that instant ?

896
02:02:55,393 --> 02:02:57,349
Who knows ?

897
02:03:01,073 --> 02:03:04,622
What happens to a nail

898
02:03:04,793 --> 02:03:11,346
to make it decide
that it just can't anymore ?

899
02:03:12,433 --> 02:03:15,391
Does he have a soul, too,
poor thing ?

900
02:03:16,033 --> 02:03:20,265
-Does he make decisions ?
-Let's sit down.

901
02:03:20,433 --> 02:03:23,584
Did the nail discuss this at length
with the painting ?

902
02:03:23,753 --> 02:03:27,826
Were they unsure about doing it ?
Had they talked about it for years ?

903
02:03:27,993 --> 02:03:32,942
Did they then decide on a date, a
time, a minute, a precise instant ?

904
02:03:33,793 --> 02:03:39,151
Or did they both know about it
from the start ? Was it all set up ?

905
02:03:39,313 --> 02:03:43,670
-''I'm letting go in seven years.''
-''That's fine with me.''

906
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:46,791
-''So it's all set for 13 May.''
-''Okay.''

907
02:03:46,953 --> 02:03:49,911
-''How about twelve noon ?''
-''Make it twelve forty five.''

908
02:03:50,073 --> 02:03:51,984
-''All right.''
-''So good night.''

909
02:03:52,153 --> 02:03:56,385
Seven years later,
on 13 May,

910
02:03:56,713 --> 02:03:58,669
at twelve forty five . . .

911
02:04:01,913 --> 02:04:04,063
It's impossible to understand.

912
02:04:04,233 --> 02:04:08,670
It's one of those things
that it's better not to think about !

913
02:04:08,833 --> 02:04:13,384
When paintings fall,when you wake up
one morning and you don't love her,

914
02:04:13,553 --> 02:04:17,512
when you open a newspaper
and read that war has broken out,

915
02:04:17,673 --> 02:04:20,187
when you see a train
and want to leave,

916
02:04:20,353 --> 02:04:23,311
when you look in a mirror
and realise you're old,

917
02:04:23,473 --> 02:04:29,423
when one evening, in the middle of
the ocean, Nineteen Hundred

918
02:04:30,473 --> 02:04:33,431
looks up from his plate,
looks me in the eye and . . .

919
02:04:33,593 --> 02:04:35,743
Tomorrow, in New York,
I'm leaving this ship.

920
02:04:39,233 --> 02:04:42,350
I was flabbergasted.

921
02:04:45,153 --> 02:04:47,109
Has the cat got your tongue ?

922
02:04:48,593 --> 02:04:52,142
No, I'm pleased.

923
02:04:52,913 --> 02:04:55,825
But it's so sudden !
Just like that !

924
02:04:55,993 --> 02:04:58,746
Right, just like that !

925
02:05:00,113 --> 02:05:02,991
Good !
Finally !

926
02:05:03,153 --> 02:05:05,030
I have to see something.

927
02:05:05,193 --> 02:05:07,309
-What ?
-The ocean.

928
02:05:10,553 --> 02:05:12,509
-The ocean ?
-The ocean.

929
02:05:18,473 --> 02:05:23,149
You're pulling my leg ? You've seen
nothing else for 32 years.

930
02:05:23,313 --> 02:05:28,262
From here. I want to see it from
there, it's not the same thing.

931
02:05:29,473 --> 02:05:34,024
Wait till we dock, lean over
the side and take a good look.

932
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:38,948
No, it's not the same thing.
You can hear its voice from the land.

933
02:05:39,113 --> 02:05:41,263
You can't from a ship.

934
02:05:41,433 --> 02:05:45,585
-What do you mean ''hear its voice?''
-Its voice.

935
02:05:49,793 --> 02:05:54,548
The voice is . . .
more than a big scream.

936
02:05:56,953 --> 02:05:59,911
It tells you that life is immense.

937
02:06:00,073 --> 02:06:05,227
Once you've heard it, you know
what you have to do to go on living.

938
02:06:06,353 --> 02:06:09,106
I could stay here for years,

939
02:06:09,993 --> 02:06:13,144
but the sea
wouldn't tell me anything.

940
02:06:14,993 --> 02:06:19,942
But if I get off, live on land for
a couple of years, I'd be normal,

941
02:06:21,233 --> 02:06:23,189
like all the others.

942
02:06:23,833 --> 02:06:27,189
Then one day I'll leave,
get to a coast,

943
02:06:27,353 --> 02:06:31,312
look up, see the ocean
and I'll hear it scream.

944
02:06:34,633 --> 02:06:39,184
I don't know who's been bullshitting
you, or if you're making it up,

945
02:06:39,353 --> 02:06:46,304
but I think the real reason
you want to leave this ship

946
02:06:46,633 --> 02:06:48,589
is that girl.

947
02:06:48,753 --> 02:06:51,506
It's always a girl.

948
02:06:51,673 --> 02:06:56,269
But even if that's not the reason,
it's fine with me. Know why?

949
02:06:56,433 --> 02:07:01,382
I've always wanted you to
play for the people on land,

950
02:07:01,553 --> 02:07:04,511
marry a nice woman and have children

951
02:07:04,673 --> 02:07:09,428
and all those things in life
which perhaps aren't immense

952
02:07:10,953 --> 02:07:12,909
but are worth the effort.

953
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:17,990
You'll come and visit me, Max,
on land ?

954
02:07:22,793 --> 02:07:24,545
Sure I will.

955
02:07:25,993 --> 02:07:29,747
That way you'll introduce me to
the mother of your children.

956
02:07:30,913 --> 02:07:33,871
And invite me to lunch.

957
02:07:34,033 --> 02:07:36,991
I'll bring the dessert
and a bottle of wine.

958
02:07:37,153 --> 02:07:40,907
You'll tell me that
I shouldn't have bothered and,

959
02:07:41,873 --> 02:07:44,865
while you're showing me around
your house, shaped like a ship.

960
02:07:46,353 --> 02:07:50,505
your wife will be cooking a turkey.
Then we'll sit at the table.

961
02:07:51,353 --> 02:07:54,743
I'll tell her
she's an excellent cook

962
02:07:54,913 --> 02:07:58,462
and she'll tell me
that you often talk about me.

963
02:08:02,793 --> 02:08:06,752
I want to give you my camel coat.

964
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:10,869
You'll cut a fine figure
when you get down there.

965
02:08:14,513 --> 02:08:17,630
You think I could have a family
with a horse ?

966
02:08:27,873 --> 02:08:29,829
-Nineteen Hundred !
-Hey !

967
02:08:29,993 --> 02:08:34,942
I've seen so many people saying
goodbye on the docks without caring.

968
02:08:35,793 --> 02:08:38,944
But when I said goodbye to
Nineteen Hundred, it was a real blow.

969
02:09:10,353 --> 02:09:12,503
Look after yourself, all right ?

970
02:09:23,353 --> 02:09:25,309
Take care.

971
02:09:31,473 --> 02:09:34,431
We laughed,
we kept saying ''see you soon'',

972
02:09:35,473 --> 02:09:38,670
but we knew
we'd never see each other again.

973
02:09:38,833 --> 02:09:42,189
There was nothing we could do
about it, it had to happen.

974
02:09:43,233 --> 02:09:45,588
And now it was happening.

975
02:10:04,833 --> 02:10:06,903
How do you get off?

976
02:10:10,793 --> 02:10:13,751
-Here he is.
-Goodbye, Nineteen Hundred !

977
02:10:15,793 --> 02:10:19,547
-Bye !
-Don't forget us.

978
02:10:20,433 --> 02:10:22,424
Wear your woollen vest.

979
02:10:22,753 --> 02:10:24,903
Write to us sometimes.

980
02:10:29,033 --> 02:10:30,989
Good luck !

981
02:11:04,113 --> 02:11:08,391
-What's up ? Did he step in shit?
-Maybe he forgot something.

982
02:11:08,553 --> 02:11:11,784
Perhaps he's forgotten
why he's getting off.

983
02:12:20,073 --> 02:12:22,029
What's he doing ?

984
02:12:45,233 --> 02:12:48,782
Whatever he saw
from that damned gangplank,

985
02:12:48,953 --> 02:12:53,231
what kind of thoughts
crossed his mind standing up there,

986
02:12:53,393 --> 02:12:55,349
he never told me.

987
02:12:56,993 --> 02:13:00,349
-No, go away !
-Wait !

988
02:13:00,513 --> 02:13:03,949
I'll give you all the money I have,
take it.

989
02:13:06,673 --> 02:13:11,622
He was strange for a long time.
He wouldn't talk to anyone.

990
02:13:11,793 --> 02:13:16,264
He preferred to be alone
for days and days.

991
02:13:16,433 --> 02:13:19,391
He seemed taken up
with very personal matters.

992
02:13:20,473 --> 02:13:23,431
Then, one day
while I was sitting at the bar. . .

993
02:13:33,593 --> 02:13:36,551
Thanks for the coat, Max.
It fit like a glove.

994
02:13:37,273 --> 02:13:40,231
It was a real shame.

995
02:13:41,113 --> 02:13:44,264
But I'm better now,
it's all done with.

996
02:13:54,953 --> 02:13:57,911
He looked like someone
who wasn't kidding,

997
02:13:58,073 --> 02:14:01,031
someone who knew
exactly where he was going.

998
02:14:01,193 --> 02:14:03,991
Like when he'd sit at the piano
and start to play.

999
02:14:05,513 --> 02:14:08,073
There were no doubts in his hands.

1000
02:14:08,233 --> 02:14:11,589
It was like the keys
had been waiting for those notes.

1001
02:14:11,753 --> 02:14:14,711
It seemed like he'd made them up
then and there,

1002
02:14:14,873 --> 02:14:19,628
but somewhere in his head, those
notes had been written all along.

1003
02:14:19,793 --> 02:14:25,265
Nineteen Hundred on that day,
had decided to sit at the keyboard

1004
02:14:25,953 --> 02:14:28,911
of his life and start playing
his most absurd music.

1005
02:14:29,753 --> 02:14:34,508
That this music would have
marked the rest of his days.

1006
02:15:29,513 --> 02:15:33,472
Look at that guy with the trumpet,
he must be drunk or half crazy.

1007
02:15:33,633 --> 02:15:37,182
-Which one ?
-The trumpeter. He's crying !

1008
02:15:59,953 --> 02:16:04,868
I left the Virginian
on 21 August, 1933,

1009
02:16:04,993 --> 02:16:10,067
with my leave papers and back pay.
Everything in order.

1010
02:16:10,233 --> 02:16:15,102
I knew that sooner or later
I'd have been through with the ocean.

1011
02:16:15,273 --> 02:16:19,027
I heard no more about
Nineteen Hundred and the Virginian.

1012
02:16:19,193 --> 02:16:22,151
Not that I ever forgot them.
On the contrary.

1013
02:16:23,473 --> 02:16:25,429
During the war, I asked myself :

1014
02:16:25,753 --> 02:16:29,507
''Who knows what Nineteen Hundred
would do if he were here,

1015
02:16:29,673 --> 02:16:32,471
who knows what he'd say.''

1016
02:16:32,633 --> 02:16:34,863
''Fuck war'', he'd say !

1017
02:16:35,033 --> 02:16:38,787
But said by me,
it wasn't the same thing.

1018
02:16:59,953 --> 02:17:03,832
A lot of time's gone by,
maybe he's gone.

1019
02:17:03,993 --> 02:17:06,905
Maybe he went to Mott Street,
to that girl.

1020
02:17:08,753 --> 02:17:10,709
Perhaps.

1021
02:21:08,713 --> 02:21:13,070
Hey, Conn, what's the problem ?
Did you lose your sealegs ?

1022
02:21:16,433 --> 02:21:19,391
Where the hell
did you find that record ?

1023
02:21:26,993 --> 02:21:29,951
What have you been up to
all these years ?

1024
02:21:35,873 --> 02:21:39,229
-Making music.
-Even during the war?

1025
02:21:42,993 --> 02:21:46,144
Even when no-one was dancing.

1026
02:21:50,193 --> 02:21:52,946
Even when the bombs were falling.

1027
02:21:55,993 --> 02:21:58,746
The music helped them get better.

1028
02:22:00,473 --> 02:22:02,429
The wounded, I mean.

1029
02:22:06,073 --> 02:22:09,952
Or else it kept them entertained,

1030
02:22:11,353 --> 02:22:14,709
as they slipped away
into another world.

1031
02:22:17,273 --> 02:22:21,551
Sometimes they
didn't even mind the voyage

1032
02:22:21,713 --> 02:22:24,466
if they could listen to the music.

1033
02:22:27,153 --> 02:22:30,111
Mine was the last face they saw.

1034
02:22:32,073 --> 02:22:36,351
I kept playing
till the ship got here.

1035
02:22:41,473 --> 02:22:44,226
Call this a ship ?

1036
02:22:44,793 --> 02:22:48,752
It's more like a mountain of
dynamite about to explode.

1037
02:22:49,153 --> 02:22:51,109
A bit dangerous, don't you think ?

1038
02:22:57,633 --> 02:22:59,385
And you, Max ?

1039
02:23:01,033 --> 02:23:02,591
Where's your Conn ?

1040
02:23:05,273 --> 02:23:08,424
I gave it up as well, a while back.

1041
02:23:08,593 --> 02:23:12,552
But now I'm in the mood
for starting again.

1042
02:23:13,473 --> 02:23:16,431
I'm busting with new ideas.

1043
02:23:17,393 --> 02:23:20,351
Let's start a duo,
you and me.

1044
02:23:21,233 --> 02:23:23,793
Or our own band :

1045
02:23:23,953 --> 02:23:29,710
The ''Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred Big Band !''

1046
02:23:30,553 --> 02:23:33,909
It gets the blood going !
What a smash we'd be.

1047
02:23:37,273 --> 02:23:43,030
Come with me. Let's watch
the big bang from the pier.

1048
02:23:43,193 --> 02:23:46,151
Then we'll start again from scratch.

1049
02:23:47,393 --> 02:23:52,751
Sometimes you have to go
right back to the beginning.

1050
02:24:03,953 --> 02:24:09,505
''You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story

1051
02:24:09,673 --> 02:24:13,666
and someone to tell it to''.
Remember?

1052
02:24:16,073 --> 02:24:18,223
You told me that.

1053
02:24:21,193 --> 02:24:25,425
Imagine how many stories
you've got to tell now !

1054
02:24:25,593 --> 02:24:32,146
The world would hang on your every
word, they'd go mad for your music.

1055
02:24:35,273 --> 02:24:36,626
Believe me.

1056
02:24:42,513 --> 02:24:44,868
All that city. . .

1057
02:24:50,113 --> 02:24:53,071
You just couldn't see an end to it.

1058
02:24:54,593 --> 02:24:56,345
The end !

1059
02:24:57,193 --> 02:25:01,345
Please,
could you showme where it ends ?

1060
02:25:05,473 --> 02:25:08,624
It was all very fine
on that gangway

1061
02:25:08,793 --> 02:25:12,149
and I was grand, too,
in my overcoat.

1062
02:25:13,353 --> 02:25:16,231
I cut quite a figure

1063
02:25:16,393 --> 02:25:20,147
and I had no doubts
about getting off.

1064
02:25:22,353 --> 02:25:25,106
No problem.

1065
02:25:28,633 --> 02:25:31,591
It wasn't what I saw that stopped me.

1066
02:25:33,233 --> 02:25:37,385
It was what I didn't see.
Can you understand that ?

1067
02:25:39,713 --> 02:25:42,273
What I didn't see.

1068
02:25:43,513 --> 02:25:47,472
In all that sprawling city,
there was everything except an end.

1069
02:25:49,793 --> 02:25:51,749
There was everything.

1070
02:25:53,673 --> 02:25:55,629
But there wasn't an end.

1071
02:25:55,793 --> 02:25:59,752
What I couldn't see
was where all that came to an end.

1072
02:26:00,993 --> 02:26:03,553
The end of the world.

1073
02:26:10,393 --> 02:26:13,146
Take a piano.

1074
02:26:14,233 --> 02:26:17,384
The keys begin, the keys end.

1075
02:26:19,513 --> 02:26:23,472
You know there are 88 of them
and no-one can tell you differently.

1076
02:26:23,633 --> 02:26:27,387
They are not infinite,
you are infinite.

1077
02:26:29,153 --> 02:26:33,112
And onthose 88 keys the music
that you can make is infinite.

1078
02:26:35,233 --> 02:26:37,189
I like that.

1079
02:26:37,833 --> 02:26:39,983
That I can live by.

1080
02:26:40,153 --> 02:26:42,713
But you get me up on that gangway

1081
02:26:42,873 --> 02:26:46,832
and roll out a keyboard
with millions of keys,

1082
02:26:46,993 --> 02:26:50,269
and that's the truth,
there's no end to them,

1083
02:26:50,593 --> 02:26:53,153
that keyboard is infinite.

1084
02:26:53,793 --> 02:26:58,742
But if that keyboard is infinite
there's no music you can play.

1085
02:26:59,793 --> 02:27:02,751
You're sitting on the wrong bench.

1086
02:27:02,913 --> 02:27:06,872
That's God's piano.

1087
02:27:08,393 --> 02:27:12,944
Christ, did you see the streets ?
There were thousands of them !

1088
02:27:13,793 --> 02:27:16,944
How do you choose just one ?

1089
02:27:18,433 --> 02:27:21,903
One woman, one house,

1090
02:27:23,793 --> 02:27:27,752
one piece of land to call your own,
one landscape to look at,

1091
02:27:28,953 --> 02:27:31,183
one way to die.

1092
02:27:34,793 --> 02:27:39,150
All that world weighing down on you
without you knowing where it ends.

1093
02:27:39,313 --> 02:27:43,272
Aren't you scared of just
breaking apart

1094
02:27:43,433 --> 02:27:46,391
just thinking about it,
the enormity of living in it ?

1095
02:27:49,953 --> 02:27:52,911
I was born on this ship.

1096
02:27:55,873 --> 02:28:02,028
The world passed me by,
but two thousand people at a time.

1097
02:28:04,393 --> 02:28:07,146
And there were wishes here,

1098
02:28:08,473 --> 02:28:12,022
but nevermore
than could fit on a ship,

1099
02:28:12,353 --> 02:28:14,708
between prow and stern.

1100
02:28:14,873 --> 02:28:19,424
You played out your happiness
on a piano that was not infinite.

1101
02:28:19,593 --> 02:28:22,551
I learned to live that way.

1102
02:28:25,993 --> 02:28:27,745
Land

1103
02:28:29,713 --> 02:28:32,671
is a ship too big for me.

1104
02:28:35,473 --> 02:28:38,431
It's a woman too beautiful.

1105
02:28:39,833 --> 02:28:43,792
It's a voyage too long.
Perfume too strong.

1106
02:28:45,793 --> 02:28:48,751
It's music I don't know how to make.

1107
02:28:52,793 --> 02:28:55,546
I can't get off this ship.

1108
02:28:58,273 --> 02:29:02,266
At best, I can step off my life.

1109
02:29:04,793 --> 02:29:08,752
After all,
it's as though I never existed.

1110
02:29:13,073 --> 02:29:15,826
You're the exception, Max.

1111
02:29:17,593 --> 02:29:20,346
You're the only one
who knows that I'm here.

1112
02:29:23,153 --> 02:29:25,542
You're a minority.

1113
02:29:25,713 --> 02:29:28,671
You'd better get used to it.

1114
02:29:33,033 --> 02:29:35,593
Forgive me, my friend.

1115
02:29:36,833 --> 02:29:38,983
But I'm not getting off.

1116
02:31:05,393 --> 02:31:06,951
Max.

1117
02:31:09,273 --> 02:31:11,503
I can picture the scene up there.

1118
02:31:11,673 --> 02:31:15,632
Some poor guy searching a list
for my name and not finding it.

1119
02:31:17,193 --> 02:31:20,344
-What did you say your name was ?
-Nineteen Hundred.

1120
02:31:21,793 --> 02:31:23,351
Niemann, Nightingale,

1121
02:31:23,513 --> 02:31:26,664
Ninestock, Nittledeen.

1122
02:31:26,833 --> 02:31:32,032
-You see, sir,  I was born on a ship.
-l beg your pardon ?

1123
02:31:32,193 --> 02:31:36,152
Born, raised and died on a ship,
maybe I'm registered there.

1124
02:31:37,593 --> 02:31:41,142
-Shipwreck ?
-No, six and a half tons of dynamite.

1125
02:31:43,353 --> 02:31:45,992
Are you feeling better now?

1126
02:31:46,153 --> 02:31:49,941
Yeah,fine
except that I lost an arm.

1127
02:31:50,993 --> 02:31:53,951
-An arm ?
-Yes, in the explosion.

1128
02:31:56,433 --> 02:31:59,391
You should be able to find one
up there.

1129
02:32:00,313 --> 02:32:03,271
-Which one do you say is missing ?
-The left, sir.

1130
02:32:04,313 --> 02:32:07,111
I'm so sorry !

1131
02:32:08,313 --> 02:32:12,545
We only seem to have two rights.

1132
02:32:12,713 --> 02:32:15,068
-Two right arms ?
-Yes.

1133
02:32:15,793 --> 02:32:17,146
I'm afraid so.

1134
02:32:17,313 --> 02:32:21,147
Would you mind awfully taking . . .

1135
02:32:22,713 --> 02:32:27,468
-Taking what ?
-A right arm instead of a left ?

1136
02:32:31,193 --> 02:32:36,142
Well, all things considered, better
a right arm than nothing at all.

1137
02:32:36,793 --> 02:32:38,272
I couldn't agree more.

1138
02:32:39,793 --> 02:32:44,423
By the way,we have one black arm
and one white arm.

1139
02:32:44,593 --> 02:32:47,153
Oh, matching arms, please.

1140
02:32:47,313 --> 02:32:52,182
I have nothing against negroes,
it's just a question of aesthetics.

1141
02:32:55,833 --> 02:32:58,188
It's no laughing matter, Max.

1142
02:33:00,393 --> 02:33:04,671
What a cock-up, spending eternity
with two right arms !

1143
02:33:05,833 --> 02:33:07,789
How wouldyou
make the sign of the cross ?

1144
02:33:23,553 --> 02:33:25,111
Max.

1145
02:33:27,113 --> 02:33:30,071
Imagine the music I could play
with two right arms.

1146
02:33:31,193 --> 02:33:34,151
I only hope
I can find a piano up there !

1147
02:33:50,793 --> 02:33:52,749
Okay, that's fine like that.

1148
02:33:52,913 --> 02:33:55,268
-Slowly.
-Get hold of it there.

1149
02:35:24,793 --> 02:35:27,068
What would you have done
in my place ?

1150
02:35:29,193 --> 02:35:31,149
I don't know.

1151
02:35:34,273 --> 02:35:37,424
I would probably
have felt quite useless.

1152
02:35:44,393 --> 02:35:49,342
Sooner or later all stories end,
and there's nothing else to add.

1153
02:35:54,473 --> 02:35:56,828
Anyhow,thanks.

1154
02:36:17,393 --> 02:36:22,547
Conn,
there's something I don't understand.

1155
02:36:23,593 --> 02:36:27,142
Who hid the broken record
inside the piano ?

1156
02:36:30,313 --> 02:36:35,831
-You're looking at him.
-So,you weren't useless afterall.

1157
02:36:46,073 --> 02:36:47,631
Conn.

1158
02:36:51,673 --> 02:36:53,231
Wait.

1159
02:36:56,393 --> 02:37:00,352
Here, take it.
I think you'll need it.

1160
02:37:03,673 --> 02:37:06,426
-But I . . .
-Fuck the money !

1161
02:37:06,593 --> 02:37:09,551
A good story is worth
more than an old trumpet.

1162
02:37:17,153 --> 02:37:19,109
Okay, Pops.
