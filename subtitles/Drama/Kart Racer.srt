165
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:43,044
This time it's gonna take
coordination!

166
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:47,048
This time it's gonna take
a message from God...

167
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,634
Things that are probably
way past you freaks

168
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,505
on your little burnt out
Nintendo ride to choo-choo ville, isn't it?

169
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,390
The cat that tames
that wild beast,

170
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:59,427
he's goin' downtown
on a ham sandwich,

171
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,429
and he ain't puttin'
any mustard on it.

172
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,565
The dude that wins that game...

173
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,433
You grab onto his tailpipes

174
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,403
because that dude
is destined for greatness.

175
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,324
That's the good.

176
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,326
That...

177
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,780
And that that games brings in,
you know, $3,000 a month.

178
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,665
$5,000 in the summer.

179
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,334
Come on, give me a potato.

180
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,966
You missed.
Uhh!

181
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,329
Aren't you a picture
of radiant joy?

182
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,164
What's up?
Are you lost?

183
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,749
Community service.

184
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,052
I'm collecting money
for new computers in the library.

185
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,337
Give me a buck.

186
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,641
You're not gonna beat
Rodney Wells with something

187
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:21,759
that's held together
with <i>double bubble.</i>

188
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,561
And what would
you know about it?

189
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,646
I hear things.

190
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,734
Thank you.

191
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,742
Um... hey.

192
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,195
Keep out? Is this where you've
got all the bodies buried?

193
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,698
It's my dad's old shop.

194
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:46,701
What kind of shop?

195
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,703
He used to build engines...

196
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,205
For nascar...
You heard of it?

197
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,708
He win anything?

198
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:54,960
You wanna see it?

199
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,552
Hey...

200
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,309
Looks like you.

201
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,062
He used to race
before I was born.

202
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,065
Okay, I'm impressed.

203
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,487
That's him when he won
nascar engine builder of the year.

204
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,542
Is that your mom?

205
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,545
Where is she now?

206
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,047
Cancer.

207
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,417
She's pretty.

208
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,809
Whoa!

209
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,811
Big block 350.

210
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,814
Turns the quarter in 7 flat.

211
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,816
Ever drive it?

212
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,817
No.

213
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,320
Why not?

214
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,822
I didn't want to die.

215
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,824
( Chuckles )

216
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:02,744
Don't touch that.

217
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:04,746
Let me see it.

218
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,247
"The Davies comet."

219
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:10,752
A two-stroke kart engine
that was better than anything out there.

220
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:13,254
My dad designed it.

221
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,757
He and my mom built it
together.

222
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,259
She was really good
with engines.

223
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,261
A chick mechanic.

224
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:21,763
Now, that's cool.

225
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,266
They made a good team.

226
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,685
But we never raced it.

227
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:28,686
Why?

228
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,188
Watts!

229
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,775
I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna come in here.

230
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:36,562
So, uh, catch you later, watts.

231
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,864
She's a girl from school.

232
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,366
Yeah, and the police station.

233
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,402
Nice group of friends
you run around with.

234
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,738
Tell me something. What is it about
our agreement you don't understand?

235
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,373
I understand it.

236
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:49,207
I just don't get it!

237
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,876
All this...
Look at all this stuff.

238
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,295
You should be proud of it.

239
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:55,546
I don't want you in here
for anything.

240
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,332
Whatever.

241
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,302
You understand?

242
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:34,168
Are you comin'?

243
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,671
Watts,
why do you always have to ask?

244
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:47,932
Radio: <i>City council today</i>
<i>voted to...</i>

( Siren )

248
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,814
Hey, watts.
I wanna talk to you.

249
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,733
I wasn't going that fast,
I swear.

250
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,485
What?

251
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,353
The throttle,
it just sorta got stuck.

252
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,655
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,024
I don't know. Maybe
we would talk about

254
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,026
what you wanna
talk about first.

255
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,528
No, that's... that's okay.

256
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,999
Wasn't sure if you
knew about this.

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,084
Ikf is coming back
to speedport.

258
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,669
Champ karts here?

259
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,504
Yeah, the regionals.

260
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,589
If I remember correctly,

261
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,592
your dad won the ikf
the last time it was here.

262
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:05,459
Grand national '74.

263
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,261
Yeah.

264
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:08,583
He was something to see,
your dad.

265
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:10,848
Anyway...

266
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,683
Thought you might like
to check it out.

267
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,136
Scott McKenna
and a couple of the top teams

268
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,138
are testing up there
this afternoon.

269
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,141
It might be better
than street racing.

270
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,112
( Drilling )

271
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,114
Dad?

272
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,616
Dad?

273
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,117
Yeah?

274
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,620
Hey, I was deputy west
this morning.

275
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,121
Oh, yeah?

276
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,824
She said the ikf regionals
are coming back to speedport.

277
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,293
Really?
Yeah.

278
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,795
She thought maybe
we could put a ride together

279
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,164
and race like we did
before mom got sick.

280
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,800
I did pretty good
in my first race. Do you remember that?

281
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,303
Third place?

282
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,804
You know?

283
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,306
You said I showed
natural ability.

284
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,312
Regionals is a lot different
than racing junior-1, watts.

285
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,647
I know. But I thought maybe

286
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:27,018
you could show me
some of the tricks that helped you win.

287
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,187
I don't think
it's a good time right now.

288
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,023
Why don't you wanna help me?

289
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,525
Can we talk about this later?

290
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:38,029
Yeah. Like that's
ever gonna happen.

291
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,531
Why did you
stop designing, anyway?

292
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,534
Is it because of mom?

293
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,504
( Crackling )

294
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,878
Plug that back in.
Tell me, dad!

295
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,882
Please don't say people don't want
you to design engines anymore...

296
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,634
Plug that back in!
Answer the question!

297
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,139
Give me that.
No!

298
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,142
Give it here.
No!

299
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:11,145
Why do you wanna do this?
Why don't you wanna help me?

300
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:13,147
Uh...

301
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,648
Oh, hi, Jen.

302
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:17,151
Is this a bad time?

303
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,153
A little family thing here.

304
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:20,655
Come on in.

305
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,159
Hey, watts.

306
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,879
What can I do for you?

307
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,382
<i>I've had this in the car</i>
<i>for about a week.</i>

308
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,917
<i>Kept forgetting to bring it in.</i>

309
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,835
I don't usually work
on anything

310
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,337
less than 8 cylinders, but..

311
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,472
I'd probably say
you're better of getting a new one.

312
00:22:38,473 --> 00:22:41,092
They just don't
make blenders the way they used to

313
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,677
and that one right there makes
the smoothest Margueritas

314
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,396
you've ever tasted.

315
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,232
Better fix it up then.

316
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,185
So, uh,

317
00:22:51,186 --> 00:22:54,021
watts mention that the ikf's
coming back to speedport?

318
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:57,025
Yeah. He, uh,
said something about it.

319
00:22:58,026 --> 00:22:59,027
Could be fun.

320
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,082
Oh, yeah, yeah.

321
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,584
See that's, uh, that's shot.

322
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,620
Can you fix it?

323
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:10,921
Take a day or two.

324
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,840
Okay.

325
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,343
Thanks.

326
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:20,848
You know, Vic?

327
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:21,715
He's a good kid.

328
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:24,969

488
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,544
It's all about you.

489
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,003
Watts.

490
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,172
Get back here.

491
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,558
Watts!

492
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,085
And with the rotax 125,
you are gonna rule out there, my boy.

493
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,087
Just sign this.

494
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,896
Oh, watts!
Hey, little pyro.

495
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,898
You bust out,
or did someone post bail?

496
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm not in the mood.

497
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,152
Sorry.
I heard what happened.

498
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,454
It'll probably be
a front-page headline

499
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:28,321
in the paper tomorrow.

500
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:30,574
Don't let them beat you, watts.

501
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,076
Hey, don't take this wrong...

502
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,079
But you don't know nothin'
about me or my problems.

503
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,081
I know more than you think.

504
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,083
Okay, so what do you suggest?

505
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,085
Hey, I got it!
Maybe I should

506
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,255
take out my frustrations by scribbling
paint over someone else's property.

507
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,590
Would that make me feel better?

508
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,509
Forget it!

509
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,935
All right.
You wanna talk about it, little dude?

510
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,637
About what?

511
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,523
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't we talk about

512
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:37,564
my grandmothers underwear?

513
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,812
How 'bout why I've been
moppin' all night, hmm?

514
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,314
After all, I didn't
set off the sprinklers.

515
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,116
I'm sorry, zee.
I'm sorry I screwed up.

516
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:49,786
It seems to be
the only thing I'm really good at.

517
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:50,904
I don't know, man,

518
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:53,790
I saw you do somethi"
on that machine that

519
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,709
nobody's ever done before.

520
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,249
It's... it's virtual reality, zee.
You know, it's not reality.

521
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,252
Hey! We don't use
that kind of language in here, okay?

522
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:09,172
For some of us,
this is the closest we're ever gonna get.

523
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,091
Listen, you little speed freak,

524
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,093
you know how to use
one of these? Huh?

525
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:14,929
Come on.

526
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,851
Uh-huh. Just what I thought.

527
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,290
Vic?

528
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,875
Hey, zee.

529
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,876
How you doin', man.

530
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,345
It feels like it's been
half a lifetime.

531
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:52,933
Yeah. Hey, how you feel
about the ikf movin' back to speedport?

532
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,435
It brings back
a lot of memories, doesn't it?

533
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,937
Yeah.
Yeah.

534
00:35:56,938 --> 00:36:01,775
You sure left
some tasty stripes hangin' on those walls.

535
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:04,778
It looks like watts there
has your taste for speed.

536
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:07,197
You think?
Oh, yeah.

537
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,483
He's got that anger
in his eyes, man.

( Tires screech )

557
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:18,161
You see those fenders?
Yeah.

558
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,663
Put 'em over against that wall.

559
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,742
Hey, watts?

560
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,162
Set those tires over there
by that metal beam!

561
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:33,353
What's goin' on?

562
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,278
What do you see?

563
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,080
Nothin'.

564
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:48,084
Well, look again.
You see it?

565
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:48,952
Yeah, I see it.

566
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,422
What do you see?

567
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,375
A lot of junk.
What do you want me to say?

568
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,446
Whoa.

569
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:19,732
( Chuckling )

570
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,534
No... no way.

571
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,456
No way!
You know what they say...

572
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,709
"One man's junk
is another man's treasure."

573
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:35,298
It's got all the key corners.
See, it's got the hairpin,

574
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,467
and through here,
you've got the chicane.

575
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,170
You gotta be real careful
through this tricky part.

576
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,839
You gotta keep your speed up,
get to the right-hander, brake,

577
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,140
hit the hammer down,

578
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,309
and take her all the way home.

579
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,813
My dad built this for me
when I was a kid.

580
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,148
To practice on.

581
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,651
So I could be
the best of the best.

582
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,021
That's what you can be, watts...

583
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,991
The best of the best.

584
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,421
( Beeping )

585
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,313
( Beeping )

586
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,265
Hey.

587
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,566
I got us a new engine.

588
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,985
I thought we were
gonna use the comet.

589
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:21,487
That's just a prototype, watts.

590
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:23,489
That thing's
not even race-ready.

591
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,992
But we can make it
race-ready. You and me.

592
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:28,995
There's too many bugs,
not enough time.

593
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:29,996
But I thought...

594
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:31,948
If you wanna race the ikf,

595
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,284
this is the engine
that's gonna get ya there.

596
00:42:55,356 --> 00:42:56,639
Looks fast.

597
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,142
Oh, dude, believe it.
It's so fast.

598
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:03,112
It better be fast 'cause your social
life needs all the help it can get.

599
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,281
Hey, watts! Are you really
racing in the regionals?

600
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,449
I'm gonna try.

601
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,985
Maybe I'll
come visit you in the pits.

602
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:09,953
I'll come, too!

603
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,622
Boy: Come on, come on!
Let's go!

604
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,625
What are you
even talking to them anyway?

605
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,298
Nice!
Did that just happen?

606
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,967
Put me in for that pit stop.

607
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,053
( Chuckling )

608
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,269
What do you think?

609
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,772
This one here, or... there?

610
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,277
Where you have it, I guess.

611
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,442
All right.
Bring her on out.

612
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,745
( Engine starts )

613
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:19,166
( Turns off engine )

614
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,452
So what's with the cans?

615
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,454
This'll help you
keep your line.

616
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,956
And your smoothness.

617
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,459
If you can make one lap

618
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,461
in one minute,

619
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,963
without knocking over one can,

620
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:36,466
you'll be ready
to race with the best.

621
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,967
That's all
I gotta do? That's it.

622
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,469
That's it?
Yeah.

623
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,971
No <i>problemo.</i>

624
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,478
( Starts engine )

625
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,955
( Laughing )

626
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:00,958
Oh...

627
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:12,252
Uhh!

628
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,224
Uhh!

629
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,597
Uhh!

630
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:29,569
Uhh!

631
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,061
Ah!

632
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,069
( Turns off engine )

633
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,074
This can't be done!

634
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,075
You just did it.

635
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,578
It took me like eight minutes.

636
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,079
It's impossible.

637
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,581
No, it isn't.

638
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,082
Why don't you do it then?

639
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,584
'Cause I've got stuff to do.

640
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,586
Come on, dad, show your skills.

641
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,588
Come on.
All right, all right.

642
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,089
I'll give you a deal,
all right?

643
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,091
You get around this course
in under a minute,

644
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,093
and hit no cans at all,

645
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,097
I got dinner detail
for the next two months.

646
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,737
Come on, anything
you want for dinner.

647
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,740
Come on.
Come on!

648
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,539
I feel like lasagna tonight!

649
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:28,614
( Laughing, chattering )

650
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:29,865
Hey.
Hey, watts.

651
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:33,536
Hey, Kate. You, uh,
you wanna go for a ride?

652
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,037
What's up?

653
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,791
Your old man give you the night
off from junkyard patrol?

654
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:39,793
Come on, ladies.

655
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,713
See ya, watts.

656
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:48,268
She's overrated, you know.

657
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:55,775
Who?

658
00:49:55,776 --> 00:49:57,143
The future prom queen.

659
00:49:57,144 --> 00:49:59,111
I could be wrong,

660
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:03,115
but I think you like your women
to have a little more... mystery.

661
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:05,368
Listen, about the other night,

662
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,869
um...
Forget it.

663
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,871
I'm beyond it.

664
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:09,706
Check this out!

665
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,042
This is sno.

666
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:17,046
He really knows
how to layer color into distinctive form.

667
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,547
Look.

668
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,299
It's beautiful.

669
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:26,607
Who's this?

670
00:50:26,608 --> 00:50:28,609
Oh, that? <i>Moi.</i>

671
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,144
You?

672
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,946
With a little help
from Michelangelo.

673
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,982
You ever try to sell anything?

674
00:50:34,983 --> 00:50:38,285
Kinda hard. Buildings
get very expensive, watts.

675
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,455
No, I mean, like, on canvas.

676
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:42,456
Who would buy it?

677
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,124
I would.

678
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:48,245
I'm flattered, but I think I'm
gonna stick to buildings for now.

679
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,914
See, in a couple of days,
this'll be gone.

680
00:50:50,915 --> 00:50:54,918
Sandblasted away or
covered by someone else's paint.

681
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:56,804
That's okay, 'cause,

682
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,890
I don't want anyone
getting too attached to it.

683
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:02,894
So... wanna make out
with me now?

684
00:51:06,014 --> 00:51:08,766
Bet you thought I was serious.

685
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:31,538
Whoa!

686
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:32,790
What the hell was that?

687
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:33,957
Weren't you lookin'?

688
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,843
Could you next time
give me a little warning?

689
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:38,762
On a race track,
there are no warnings.

690
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,465
You go in prepared,
you anticipate, and you react.

691
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,633
End of story.

692
00:51:42,634 --> 00:51:43,718
Ah!

693
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,794
Bumper cars. Come on!

694
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:16,301
You wanna play rough?

695
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,763
Hey, where you goin'?

696
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,985
Watts: When did you first know
you wanted to design engines?

697
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,688
February 14, 1976.

698
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:39,690
It was the Daytona 500.

699
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:41,191
What a race that was.

700
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:45,245
Richard petty... he was
the man to beat that year.

701
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:48,332
He was comin' off
of 13 wins in '75.

702
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,335
He looked like a shoo-in

703
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:54,621
to take home his
record breaking sixth 500.

704
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:57,007
Held the lead for
almost the entire race.

705
00:52:57,008 --> 00:53:00,010
Then on the last lap,

706
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:05,132
David Pearson
pulls out of petty's draft,

707
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,935
and both cars start
spinnin' and crashin'.

708
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:10,020
It was... it was chaos.

709
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:13,023
Debris flyin' everywhere.

710
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:16,193
It was one of the most
exciting finishes

711
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,695
the 500 ever had.

712
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,198
And I didn't see any of it.

713
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:24,484
What?

714
00:53:24,485 --> 00:53:30,490
Because at the moment
that Pearson was making his move on petty,

715
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:33,994
I found myself staring
down in pit row

716
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:36,496
at the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen

717
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:37,998
in a mechanic's jumpsuit.

718
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,052
She was standing up
on this retaining wall,

719
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:44,555
yellin' her head off.

720
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:47,558
But even from
where I was sitting,

721
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:52,062
you could still see
that fire in her eyes, you know?

722
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:53,564
That was mom.

723
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:55,599
Yeah.

724
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,603
And I realized that moment
two things:

725
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:04,107
What I wanted to do
with the rest of my life,

726
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,360
and who I wanted
to spend it with.

727
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,667
It was what you might call
a defining moment.

728
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:32,303
Hey, Scott.

729
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,723
What do you think
of my son Rodney?

730
00:54:36,724 --> 00:54:38,225
Kid's got some talent.

731
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:39,226
Some.

732
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:40,227
Man: This way, Scott.

733
00:54:40,228 --> 00:54:41,778
Great. Thanks.

734
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,530
Excuse me, Scott.

735
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:46,199
Um, I'm a local racer,

736
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,119
and I was at speedport
the day you were doin' the 360 spins...

737
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,203
Davies donuts.
You liked those, huh?

738
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,204
Pretty cool?

739
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,706
Davies donuts?

740
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:55,909
Yeah, I copied them off
a guy named Vic Davies.

741
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,545
Vic Davies.

742
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:00,547
The only guy to ever win
three grand nationals.

743
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,549
I'm still chasing
his lap record.

744
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:08,005
Yeah, I heard of him.
Thanks for your time.

745
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:10,641
Hey, what did you say
your name was?

746
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:12,142
Watts.

747
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,428
I look forward
to racing you, watts.

748
00:55:32,113 --> 00:55:34,748
Okay, zero hour.

749
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:36,117
Time to show me what you got.

750
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:19,626
It's the best I can do.

751
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:20,627
I ran, like, flat out.

752
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:23,046
Not bad.
54 seconds.

753
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:26,717
Fifty...

754
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:27,801
Yes!

755
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:29,469
Hey, champ.

756
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,337
Come on in here.

757
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:42,516
My old racing colors.

758
00:56:42,517 --> 00:56:45,520
Your mother always did
like you in red.

759
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:55,246
See you in victory Lane.

760
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:42,709
<i>This is Bob Jenkins</i>
<i>and Paul romanuk,</i>

761

767

<i>well over 100 Miles an hour,</i>

768
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,008
<i>so there's no room for error.</i>

769
00:57:58,009 --> 00:57:59,509
<i>That's a good point, Bob.</i>

770

<i>a lot of sad faces.</i>

772
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,240
You all set?

773
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,158
There's a lot
of big names out there.

774
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,028
Yeah, well...

775
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:20,614
Worry about them
out there on the track,

776
00:58:20,615 --> 00:58:21,415
not in here.

777
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:24,952
Let's go.

778
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:35,712
<i>All drivers to the pits.</i>

779
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,547
<i>Let's get our first</i>
<i>qualifying round underway.</i>

780
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,049
<i>Scott McKenna,</i>
<i>current reigning champion,</i>

781
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,518
<i>will be first on the track.</i>

782
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,386
<i>I'm sure we're gonna see</i>
<i>a hot lap</i>

783
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,688
<i>from this young driver.</i>

784
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,973
<i>Yeah, this kid's got it.</i>

785
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,112
Tooms: Ooh, baby!

786
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:55,615
Okay, let's take a look
at the competition.

787
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,200
We've got Kyle Walker.

788
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,120
He won the wka championships
last year.

789
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:01,488
And there's the babe herself...

790
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:03,490
Natalie prefontaine.

791
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:05,292
She's lookin'
mighty fine today.

792
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,293
Mighty fine.

793
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:07,460
The big question:

794
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,796
Will local underdog
watts Davies

795
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,048
find his way out
of the starting grid? Let's ask him.

796
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,884
Hey!
Back.

797
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:16,052
Go get 'em, wattsie!
You're the man!

798
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,671
Move back. This is
a restricted area here.

799
00:59:17,672 --> 00:59:19,172
How ya feelin'?

800
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:20,640
I think I'm gonna heave.

801
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:21,892
Good.

802
00:59:21,893 --> 00:59:23,510
Good?!

803
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:25,729
I always ran best
when I felt like tossin' my cookies.

804
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,231
It'll go away.

805
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,933
Phil!

806
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:31,484
Phil!

807
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,271
Hey, light bulb.

808
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:36,741
Road kill.

809
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,114
<i>Scott McKenna is on the course.</i>

810
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:55,542
<i>He is worth watching, Bob.</i>

811

Dad?

1037
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:35,768
You ran a good race, watts.

1038
01:17:35,769 --> 01:17:39,271
Why is it that
anything that's good

1039

1040

Would you give us
a second, please?

1041
01:17:50,784 --> 01:17:53,952
Sometimes bad things

Can I tell you something?

1044
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,344
When your mother died...

1045
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:06,132
That was the hardest thing
I ever had to go through.

1046
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,104
These last four years...

1047
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:16,609
It's been hard feeling anything
except sorry for myself.

1048
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:25,617
I know that I haven't
always been there for you...

1049
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:29,989
In ways that maybe
I could have.

1050
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:35,128
But you showed me
something today, son.

1051
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:38,464

1052
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,252
From here on out...

1053
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:48,307
It's you and me, 100%.

1054
01:18:48,308 --> 01:18:49,676
Prove it, dad.

1055
01:18:51,845 --> 01:18:53,596
The comet?

1056
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,483
Watts, that thing's
never even raced.

1057
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:59,401
Never turned more than
two or three laps.

1058
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,487
I don't even know
if the damn thing'll run.

1059
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:02,238
It'll run.

1060
01:19:04,023 --> 01:19:05,858

It'll run.

Excuse me. Guys?

1063
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,201
I heard your engine got cooked.

1064
01:19:16,202 --> 01:19:18,704
I have a spare engine
on my truck.

1065
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:20,757
It's yours... if you want it.

1066
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,677
I wanna beat
the best out on the track,

1067
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,930
not back here.

1068
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,468
We appreciate that.

1069
01:19:32,469 --> 01:19:35,305

01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:43,862
The rule is...

1131
