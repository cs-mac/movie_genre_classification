I have allways woundered:
If you hit a mime,

3
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,958
would he make a sound?

4
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,958
Well, now you know.

5
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,083
Ilostmyteeth.

6
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:39,958
What is he saying?

7
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,830
I don't know. Something about thiish.

8
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,333
w... w...

9
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,833
Ohh, he lost his teeth.

10
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,541
Terry...

11
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,250
Hey!

12
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,291
You sons of bitches ain't going anywhere. 
I saw the whole damn thing.

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,166
I'm calling the police!

14
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,083
We are the police.

15
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,666
"Every depression leads to war."

16
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,833
Simone de Beauvoir.

17
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,900
It Prud'hon Pierre-Joseph,
The father of anarchism.

18
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,083
instead of Simone de Beauvoir,
feministka-ekzistentsialistka.

19
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,208
I bet you 50 bucks.

20
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,333
I will take that bet.

21
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,875
Hello, Uncle Terry!

22
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,480
How is it hanging Cesar?

23
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,458
A little early in the day Terry?

24
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,900
It's midnight in Tokyo.

25
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,916
Hi uncle Terry.

26
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,083
Hi little Bob.

27
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,458
Where is my x-box?

28
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,041
How the fuck should i know?

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,660
Ohh, you know what? It's up my ass. 
You wanna go and see it?

30
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,900
It's in the dining room.

31
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,291
I hit your car Bob.

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,666
Again?

33
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:34,875
Yeah.

34
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,291
Is it bad?

35
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,875
We should take my car.

36
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,380
You had a nice swim honey?

37
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,416
My eyes hurt.

38
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,291
I told you Bob! You put too
 much chlorine in the pool.

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,833
No no. I followed those instructions.

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,260
He has been up to something.

41
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,125
No I haven't.

42
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,620
No I haven't. Our little innocent little 
lord fucking fartalort over here.

43
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,208
Stop.

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,060
- It has been itching all weekend. 
- I am trying to digest over here.

45
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,900
When was the last time you had sex?

46
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,375
Thursday.

47
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,083
And when did it start itching?

48
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,660
Saturday in late afternoon, early evening.

49
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,666
It's thrush.

50
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,708
What is thrush?

51
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,166
I wore a condom.

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,375
It don't matter.

53
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,420
- What do I do about it?
- You go to a drog store.

54
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,420
They will give you some cream 
or something. You will be fine.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,380
What is thrush?

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Thrush is a small to medium size song bird.

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,860
Now get the fuck out of here.

58
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,916
Can you guys not...

59
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,700
discuss his genital complaints 
when I am trying to eat.

60
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,380
Is that too much to ask for?

61
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,540
This looks like dick and balls now.

62
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,833
See you later Delores.

63
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,958
See you later Terry.

64
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,800
- He has fucking broke it mom.
 - No!

65
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,041
Ohh, you know what?

66
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,166
It is broken.

67
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,458
Mom!

68
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,820
Take it easy man. You make me look bad 
in front of all my fucking white neighbors

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,940
Lets go fuck some scumbags.

70
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,041
Balloon Museum
ALBUQUERQUE

71
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,250
What are they doing now?

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,416
Looking at the exhibits.

73
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,060
Fuck you think they are doing?

74
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,125
So waste of time.

75
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,416
No it's not.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,000
What do you think the web brothers are doing here?
Drawn in the Balloon Museum?

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,900
You think they are researching 
the history of aeronautics? No.

78
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,620
Oh look at this guy point. You
 are not fooling anybody body.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,180
Do you think they gonna heist the place?

80
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,300
It's popular with the yo calls 
but I recons it's just a meet.

81
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,060
- Ow! Hold it right there.
- Here, right here?

82
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,860
Yeah, the light is perfect.

83
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,380
Like this?
Yeah, that's really nice.

84
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,600
That's Jimmy Harris.

85
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,333
And his fucking jojo.

86
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,340
I thought he was sitting.

87
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,833
He got out some month ago.

88
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,780
Who is the other guy with the kid?
No idea.

89
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
What kind of criminal brings
 his kid to a meet though?

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,660
Eyes here. Eyes here.
Why am I looking there?

91
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,125
There we go.

92
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,166
Hm.. The jojos where once...

93
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,125
They were banned in Damascus?

94
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,540
Ha, it was believed that they caused drought.

95
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,540
Look at all these fucking assholes working.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,125
Suckers!

97
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,791
Welcome back, guys!

98
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,875
How was your vacation?

99
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,583
Very pleasant!

100
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,958
I masturbated a lot.

101
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,750
Forced vacation, I should say.

102
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,875
What?

103
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,541
Ok...

104
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,380
So the clowns are back?

105
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,333
Tweedledum?

106
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,666
Siegfried and Roy, Sacco and Vanzetti,
Abelard and Heloise ...

107
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,940
This quiz?

108
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,740
No it's not a quiz.

109
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,458
This is your last chance.

110
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,958
Ok?

111
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,416
This is it!

112
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,500
No more suspensions.

113
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,625
Great!

114
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,083
You will be kicked out next time!

115
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
Oh, that's not great.

116
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,300
You would have already been fired, if the authorities
 were able to prove some rumors.

117
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,740
- Yeah, but you know what they say about rumors.
- Rumors are the engine of progress.

118
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,780
No, it's laziness - the engine of progress.

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,791
Rumors then?

120
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,480
Rumors are  ...
Silenzio!

121
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,041
Assault on a colleague -
is one thing!

122
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,041
Bribery and corruption charges against you

123
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,208
and that's it.

124
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,416
We were provoked.

125
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,791
Bob was provoked!

126
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:03,958
Same thing.

127
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,500
So, guys.

128
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,541
I agree with you

129
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,791
about the race issue.

130
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,041
I'm married to a "Ching" myself!

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,791
I have "Ching" kids.

132
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,125
Look at their faces.

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,833
Good looking boys.

134
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,458
I know how you felt Bob.

135
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:25,220
But that is not a reason for assaulting a fellow officer.
No matter what they say.

136
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,780
He called me a wetback.

137
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
He knows that I was born here!

138
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,250
He is a big racist pig!

139
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,375
Yes!

140
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,780
He is a big fat racist pig.

141
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,875
I agree!

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,750
No argument there.

143
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,166
But look!

144
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,380
This is the police department.

145
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,333
We are surrounded by big fat racist pigs.

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,625
So work with me here.

147
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,180
So,

148
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,780
What have we learned here?

149
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,020
Do not assault a fellow officer.

150
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,291
Even if he is a racist pig.

151
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,375
Yeah ... and?

152
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,333
Something about rumors.

153
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,583
No.

154
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,100
Chinese kids?

155
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,458
No.

156
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,700
Bribery and corruption!

157
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,791
Yes!

158
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,300
Bribery and corruption.

159
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,220
And what about bribery and corruption?

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,000
Ohh, there is a part two..

161
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,340
Don't get involved with it?

162
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,150
Don't get involved with it
in any way, shape or form.

163
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,916
Bribes and corruption - bad!

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,291
Excellent!

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,166
Progress has been made.

166
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,791
Leave the scene.

167
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,020
Who is that ass who used to 
hang out with Harris?

168
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,041
Negro gentleman.

169
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,458
Reggie Hayes.

170
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
But he changed it? Didn't he?

171
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,333
Changed his name.

172
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,220
He joined the "Nation of Islam".

173
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,250
Reggie X!

174
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,333
Reggie X!

175
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,291
Who sings?

176
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,125
Glenn Campbell.

177
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,250
Cool song.

178
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,375
Masterpiece.

179
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:05,541
Do you see him?

180
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,333
Maybe hiding somewhere.

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,541
Thats what these criminal types do

182
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,916
Hiding.

183
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,083
Ah, there he is.

184
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,833
Reggie!

185
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,083
As-Salamu Alaykum.

186
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,833
He did not seem happy to see us.

187
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,625
What's wrong, guys?

188
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,660
You know how to read, don't you?

189
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,791
Egghead bastard.

190
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,958
Or not taught in school?

191
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,416
I'm actually dyslexia.

192
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:31,916
Ok?

193
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,083
And I find that statement to be offensive.

194
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Are you an actor?

195
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,416
Dyslexia is only for movie stars.

196
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
The rest of us call it stupidity.

197
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,083
You know these bastards?

198
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,220
You shouldn't have done that.

199
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,458
And what will he do?

200
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,958
Tell Mom?

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,291
What the fuck?
I didn't do a shit!

202
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,500
What is that, Terry?

203
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,166
Certainly not origami.

204
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,500
You got to be kidding me

205
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,875
I think legally it is called

206
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,916
banned substance.

207
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,291
No!

208
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,375
Ohh yeah.

209
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,041
Definitely a banned substance.

210
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,625
And you found it on him, is that correct?

211
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,625
He hid it in his anus, your honor.

212
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, you filthy animal!

213
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,458
Filthy animal!

214
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,060
You are a dealer now, Reggie.

215
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,540
You two are fucked up.

216
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,708
You still homies with Jimmy Harris?

217
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,180
Not since back in the day.
 Thought he moved on.

218
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,750
Not everyone can sell toasters, you now?

219
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,750
I work at the highest level!

220
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,208
I'm a designer of stolen toasters.

221
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,666
Yes, big fucking shit!

222
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,041
Fancy, shit.
Yeah, fancy shit! From Moschino!

223
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,380
Moschino doesn't make toasters!

224
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,980
But you're friends, right?

225
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,580
We know each other.

226
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,833
Have you heard that your
 friend is back in town?

227
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,625
- I heard
- You did.!

228
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,333
We followed the webb brothers.

229
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,860
- Do you know the web brothers?
- Well, who doesn't know them?.

230
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,625
Already good progress!

231
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,875
They are up to something.

232
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,220
I mean, so our informants told us.

233
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,291
Where would we be without our informants?

234
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,625
Nowhere.

235
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
Exactly, dude!

236
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,166
So Jimmy Harris and the 
Webbs are hooked up...

237
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,583
So...

238
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,541
- So ...
- "So" What motherfucker?

239
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,620
They are planning a fucking robbery.

240
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,833
Exactly!

241
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,083
Quietly, quietly.

242
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,666
We gonna fuck them up,
and you are going to help us.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Fuck!

244
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,583
The cops!

245
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,375
Shit! We are the cops!

246
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,458
For a second I forgot.

247
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,083
And I was like, "Fuck!"

248
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,125
And I was like, "Where... Where?"

249
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,958
If I don't help you..
You gonna bust me for possession?

250
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,740
Educated man, Terry.

251
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,166
Good coke!

252
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,700
There is more.

253
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,083
Where did you get this?

254
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,580
We fucked up a mime.

255
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,291
The race has begun!

256
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,375
Oh, Your Grace!

257
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,060
She is a three year old.

258
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,083
Beautiful filly.

259
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,010
Which would you like in the saddle?

260
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,540
I haven't ridden her yet.

261
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,583
She is playful.

262
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,416
Excuse me. One of my trainers.

263
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,041
Keep me informed about current envelopment.

264
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,333
Of course.

265
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,166
I hate champagne.

266
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,125
Why did I drink?

267
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,458
One of the unsolved mysteries of life.

268
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,208
How's my crew?

269
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,916
Or how are my crew? If I should
 be more grammatically correct.

270
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,083
All set.

271
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,250
The Webbs just checked in.

272
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,958
The other thing?

273
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,500
You probably guessed:

274
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,625
Reynard wants more money.

275
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,125
Of course.

276
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,666
What should I do?

277
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,375
Pay him.

278
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,000
We will get the money back.

279
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,666
If I do not end up in jail.

280
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:50,958
Oh, Russell ...

281
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,458
Jail is not too bad.

282
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,708
You know the worst thing about jail?

283
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,625
I do not know, Your Grace.

284
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,500
The violent anal sex.

285
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,375
And you know the best thing in jail?

286
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,958
Violent anal sex?

287
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,060
Yeah,

288
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
You are pretty quick for an American.

289
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,500
Jimmy used to go out with this dancer,

290
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,708
Jacqueline Hollis. Rumor is
 he shacked up with her.

291
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,083
You have an address?

292
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,458
No, but...

293
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,333
I do know that she works at...

294
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,791
the club "Knockout".

295
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,708
This means that you, 
unfortunately, will have to

296
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,041
"Work".

297
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,083
Don't talk to me like that.

298
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,458
I will kick your ass to China.

299
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,180
What the fuck is that?

300
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,958
Cocktail "Cocksucking Cowboys".

301
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,458
My balls still hurt.
And I didn't do you anything.

302
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,958
The world is unfair, man.

303
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,060
Call amnesty international if
 you want to do something.

304
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,875
Salut.

305
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,000
I thought you guys didn't drink.

306
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,125
How do you mean?

307
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,250
Muslims.

308
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,541
I am a "Pyatiprotsentnik".

309
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,666
Ah, got it.

310
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,166
You know what it means?

311
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
I know what that means.

312
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,666
You know this other douchebag?

313
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,208
Am I Huggy Bear now?

314
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,750
Huggy Bear ...

315
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,083
"Starsky and Hutch" ...
My favorite TV series.

316
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,125
Who took these?

317
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,500
Some epileptic?

318
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,250
Yes, Helmut Newton, over here.

319
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,760
- Yeah, there were something wrong with the ...
-With the "thing"..

320
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,916
Yes, the "thing".

321
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,875
The "thing" can be tricky.

322
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,860
Hey, motherfucker!
I can bust you right now for that.

323
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,500
I have multiple sclerosis.

324
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,291
Marijuana relieves symptoms.

325
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,250
Dyslexia and multiple sclerosis?

326
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,208
Yes, my life has been hard.

327
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,500
You can not even spell "sclerosis".

328
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:54,666
"Scle ..."

329
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,083
Ohh, fuck ...

330
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,291
I don't know.

331
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,416
It's Reynard.

332
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,791
Clifford Reynard.

333
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,540
I used to steal cars with him.

334
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,416
I think he is a driver now.

335
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,958
He is a fucking prick anyways.

336
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,958
I claim my prize?

337
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,541
It's amazing.

338
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,541
The flexibility!

339
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,300
You should have seen her when she was 15.

340
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,940
You guys looking for me?

341
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,260
If you are the manager of this shit hole

342
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,458
then yes we are.

343
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,666
I'm Detective Bolano.

344
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Detective Monroe.

345
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,416
You are...

346
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,980
Russell Bёrdvell.

347
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,420
What is the problem?

348
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,100
We are looking for the address for
one of your dancers: Jaklin Hollis

349
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,208
Jackie Hollis?

350
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,541
What ever.

351
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,083
She dosen't work for me anymore. She quit.

352
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,375
I didn't ask if she works here now.

353
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,916
I asked for her address.

354
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,875
She's into some kind of trouble?

355
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,660
Just give us the fucking address.

356
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,416
You guys are adorable...

357
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,041
Where are you from? What district?

358
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,333
We are from hell, baby.

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,740
You know that guy that discoverd
Uranus wanted to call it George.

360
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,625
This is the planet George.

361
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,708
Come on, Harris.

362
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,458
What?

363
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,583
Hello Darling.

364
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,750
Tell Jimmy Harry wants to see him.

365
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,958
- Harry who
- Harry fucking Krishna.

366
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,750
Get away from the door, mam.

367
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,958
Yeah, it is Muhammad Ali!

368
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,041
Leave him alone.

369
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,791
He is a Quaker.

370
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,833
You have any guns stashed anywhere?

371
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,583
No! I told you, he is a Quaker.

372
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,166
He denies violence.

373
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,416
What?

374
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,125
He denies violence.

375
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,958
Fucking pig!

376
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,500
That's not very nice.

377
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,180
Jackie can you put on some coffee
for Mr. Harris here.

378
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,916
And you should probably have one.

379
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,540
You want some donuts too?

380
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,666
Fuckers.

381
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,958
Nice underwear, Jimmy.

382
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,916
Wide screen! Cool.

383
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,708
You like Glenn Campbell?

384
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,916
Who!

385
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,958
Never heard Glenn Campbell?

386
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,791
What's gonna happen to him?

387
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,666
With Glen Campbell?

388
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:04,958
With Jimmy.

389
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,583
Sent back to prison,
Without a nickle.

390
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,833
There is nothing you can do for him?

391
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,250
Are you trying to bribe us, mam?

392
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,583
No.

393
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,833
Damn it!

394
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,416
All such law-abiding ...

395
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:24,958
How much?

396
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,291
How much do you have?

397
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,416
Five ... Two!

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,250
- Two thousand
- How much do you have?

399
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:31,958
Five.

400
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,833
Excellent! We take it.

401
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,260
And he is free to walk?

402
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,860
If it is in his capabilities.

403
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,480
And I'm taking the wide screen too.

404
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,833
Do you need something?

405
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,083
No.

406
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,041
So tell us, Jimmy ...

407
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,708
Why in town?

408
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,625
You are not planning a caper?

409
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,375
You have a X-box wire?

410
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,708
I can't concentrate.

411
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,458
They were here first.

412
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,300
It's a Soderbergh movie!
It requires focus.

413
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,791
What Soderbergh?

414
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,125
Steven Soderbergh -
Is a Jewish American actor.

415
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,291
He is a Swede.

416
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,625
Clooney is in jail in Florida.

417
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,791
Jennifer Lopez is in this movie.

418
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,060
Takes her blouse of, but you 
can't see the boobs.

419
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,708
Why can't you see her boobs?

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,416
Because she is a serious actress,
that's why.

421
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,140
She wouldn't show her boobs
 for someone like you.

422
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,791
Caesar open.

423
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:29,916
You go open.

424
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,916
He told you ... mom!

425
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,958
Stop whining and open the door.

426
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,500
Why do you always pick no me?

427
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,900
Because you're the youngest
 and most vulnerable.

428
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,916
That quote is Simone de Beauvoir.

429
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,708
If I could only find a damn thing...

430
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,250
50 buck coming my way!

431
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,791
Don't pay her, Dad.

432
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,250
This jackass says you wanted to see him.

433
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,260
Do not call Reggie a jackass. That's rude.

434
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,875
It is actually inaccurate.

435
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,250
He is more like a pathetic simpleton.

436
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,083
Sit down.

437
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,916
So you found Jimmy?

438
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,250
I did not find his spirit.

439
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,500
Sorry for Terry making fun of your religion.

440
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,291
I apologies on his behalf.

441
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,416
Jennifer Lopez is in this.

442
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,540
Takes her blouse of, but you 
can't really see her boobs.

443
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,583
I know!

444
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,166
No, stop your lordship!

445
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:31,708
Your father...

446
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,583
I don't give a damn about my father!

447
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,750
Some cops showed up at the club tonight.

448
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,166
Some shit about one of my dancers.

449
00:21:58,541 --> 00:21:59,541
Former dancer.

450
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,791
Do you think it has something to do with us?

451
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,916
Maybe. Maybe not.

452
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,020
Should I tell the Webs to cancel?

453
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,208
No.

454
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,250
Probably just a coincidence.

455
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,583
Get hold of the girl.

456
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,250
See what her story is.

457
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,416
Give them a warning if necessary.

458
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,333
So where is this grand finale you
have been promising me?

459
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,250
Relax, maestro.

460
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,416
It's on its way.

461
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,083
Albuquerque Racetrack and Casino.

462
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,458
A million dollars.

463
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,166
Any questions, gentlemen?

464
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,541
I do not know what it is:
supreme confidence  or idiocy.

465
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,916
What ever...

466
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,083
Russell ...

467
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:56,583
Do you ever think that your 
God is anything else but an illusion?

468
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:58,958
No.

469
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,708
I love cheerleaders.

470
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,208
Is that part of your act?

471
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,958
I Majorettes, moron.

472
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,875
I love majorettes too.

473
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,750
I'm not prude.

474
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,583
What do you want?

475
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,541
Brought you a new TV.

476
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,583
You have a conscience after all.

477
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,875
You want it or not?

478
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,250
Weirdo.

479
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,416
You are the weirdo.

480
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,666
You are the weirdo.

481
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,375
Who is this asshole?

482
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:08,833
It's my ex.

483
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,458
Looks like a douchebag.

484
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
He is a really intelligent guy.

485
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:18,083
He wrote a well regarded monograph
on André le nôtre.

486
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,500
And he had a nice dick.

487
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,250
And who is this?

488
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:25,916
My ex.

489
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,208
He had a nice dick too.

490
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,916
What's this about?

491
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,333
I do not know.

492
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,291
About loneliness?

493
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,166
Kind of creepy.

494
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,083
Like something bad gonna happen.

495
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,666
And there is nothing she can do about it.

496
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,208
Yes.

497
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,666
So where did Jimmy 
boy say he was going?

498
00:25:58,416 --> 00:25:59,625
Kenosha.

499
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,250
Kenosha, Wisconsin.

500
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,333
Yeah, right.

501
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:07,833
He has not left town.

502
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,625
What makes you so sure?

503
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:11,375
The Sixth Sense, honey.

504
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,820
Let's leave it with that

505
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,958
Why did you become a cop?

506
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,480
Your heart doesn't exactly seem to be in it.

507
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,708
I guess I wanted to pervert
 the course of justice.

508
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,100
And you can shoot at people
for no reason.

509
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,666
And nobody can do a damn thing about it.

510
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,541
Any sign of Reynard?

511
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,083
No, he is still in there.

512
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,860
What's going on in the big wide world?

513
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,458
Two hundred people died 
in an earthquake in Peru.

514
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,041
Who gives a fuck?

515
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,708
Peruvians.

516
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,458
That looks nasty.

517
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,916
Are you his wife?

518
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,208
Why did you stick him?

519
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,041
Why did you stick him?

520
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,125
It's getting a bit trite now.

521
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,166
Can we play a little game?

522
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,208
Called "Shut the fuck up."

523
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,541
Mam, did you do those paintings?

524
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,375
He is gone.

525
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,416
So is he.

526
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,740
You know that Joseph Conrad
and Van Gogh both tried to kill themselves?

527
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,700
By shooting themselves in the heart?

528
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,875
and both missed!

529
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:45,333
It's true.

530
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,708
I'm not making this up!

531
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,625
Fuck you!

532
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,625
Crime scene pricks are on their way.

533
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,208
She says his name is Danny.

534
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,041
And about Reynard?

535
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,375
What's he up to?

536
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,620
I can barely get a word out of her.
She is still bawling her eyes out.

537
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,541
Shut up!

538
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:05,166
- What do we do with the kid?
- What can we do?

539
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:10,875
Out!

540
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,250
That was out.

541
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,875
Give me a second, Sisters.

542
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,583
I will play.

543
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,625
It's good.

544
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,700
What happened to 
your nose sweetheart?

545
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,041
Chihuahua bit me.

546
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:35,875
What's up?

547
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,375
Clifford Reynard
died this morning.

548
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:40,791
So what?

549
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:43,541
Webb Brothers will need a new driver.

550
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,958
Probably soon.

551
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,166
If you here anything...

552
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,541
Yes, I know
what to do.

553
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,791
Fucking missed it.

554
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,791
You did not mean that!

555
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,416
Pure luck!

556
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,583
Come on!

557
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,250
No need for fucking jihad here!

558
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,416
Can't take him anywhere...

559
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,041
My mom died young.

560
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,500
She was an alcoholic.

561
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,291
And what about your dad?

562
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,458
I never knew him.

563
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:25,916
How about you?

564
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,833
He is dead.

565
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,666
How?

566
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,916
Suicide murder.

567
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,291
Suicide murder?

568
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:40,125
Was that some pact thing?

569
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,875
Like killed your mom and then himself?

570
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,791
No, my mother was in Tennessee.

571
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,500
Another woman?

572
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,750
No.

573
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,541
- Another man?
- Yes.

574
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,291
But he wasn't gay or anything.

575
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,791
I don't get it?

576
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:59,416
He worked as a security guard.
But wanted to be a SWAT guy.

577
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,166
- Never made it.
- Why?

578
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,208
- Why? I don't know.
- They are assholes?.

579
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Well so was he.

580
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,958
One day he went to the bar.

581
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,416
He gets to drinking, get more and
more depressed and

582
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,208
he pour out his gun
and blew his brains out.

583
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,833
Unfortunately,
there is this guy sitting next to him.

584
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,041
The bullet goes throw my dad's head

585
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
and hit this other guy in his head

586
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,375
- and kills him.
- No.!

587
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:25,958
Yes.

588
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,500
The investigation determined that this
was a suicide

589
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:30,916
and a murder.

590
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,333
Although...

591
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,620
If my dad was dead before the bullet
hit this other guy in his head

592
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,041
was it actually murder?

593
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,000
Philosophically speaking?

594
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,500
It's a interesting question!

595
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,541
I'll ask Bob, he will know.

596
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,333
Let me know what he says.

597
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,125
Movies have become entirely without plot.

598
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,958
Just right to bed.

599
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,958
No strings, no development ...

600
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,540
Where is the romance?

601
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,833
Starts and ends with the script.

602
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,250
You don't have a good script -
you ain't got a shit.

603
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,625
Do you think you're tough, right?

604
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,791
Think I can help with that!

605
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,041
It's real. Going up.

606
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:23,958
Playboy Mansion!

607
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,375
Break!

608
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,250
Whatever it is, it's happening
down town

609
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,083
1pm tomorrow.
Don't ask me what.

610
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,375
Who is doing the driving?

611
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,041
The guy is formerly known as prince.
How the fuck should I know?

612
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,708
Something I forgot to tell you:
Surrender!

613
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,875
How do I look?

614
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,583
Suits you.

615
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,958
Stupid fucking cops.

616
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,541
You're soaked.

617
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,833
You ok?

618
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,083
Yeah, I'm ok.

619
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,916
Was it a bad dream?

620
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,916
Go back to sleep, baby.

621
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:04,916
Perfectly!

622
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
You know what they say about vertigo?

623
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,541
Vertigo is not the fear of falling
but the fear of wanting to fall.

624
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,583
Hello, hot ladies.

625
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,333
Something's wrong.

626
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,625
They are not going to rub a mosque?

627
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,958
They will get ISIS on their asses.

628
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,125
"Al-Qaeda".

629
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,291
Is it "al-Qaeda" or "Al Cade?"

630
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,416
You say, "Cade" I say
"Qaeda".

631
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,500
I say, "Cade," you say
"Qaeda".

632
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,125
What are you doing?

633
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,580
Preventing a terrorist attack, what else?

634
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Fuck off.

635
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:14,125
- You fuck off.
- No, you fuck off..

636
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,916
You might wanna be a little careful.

637
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,125
Or you will end up as
 a dead schizophrenic.

638
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,625
And that's a children's bike?

639
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,916
You don't think Reggie would ...?

640
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,458
Fuck!

641
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,416
It would have been better if you
went to Wisconsin, Jimmy boy.

642
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,625
You know him?

643
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,860
Yeah!

644
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,100
James Harris. He have been
on the run for a couple of months.

645
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,750
Apparently he is a Quaker.

646
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,708
I thought Quakers were against violence.

647
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,875
Was it a good shoot or a bad shoot?

648
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,416
That's what we call a "contentious issue".

649
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,833
Fuck me!

650
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,333
Again, really?

651
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,750
It's like every fucking week!

652
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,060
At least these guys are white.

653
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,220
Yeah, got to look at the bright side.

654
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,900
What happened to the driver?

655
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He got away.

656
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,916
White, Hispanic or black?

657
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,250
African American.

658
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,791
Got away with the money
 too. Almost a million.

659
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,166
Wait a second.

660
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,708
How did you know
the driver was missing?

661
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,083
Wild guess.

662
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,375
You guessed?

663
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,380
I never said missing. No one said missing.

664
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,750
- You said "what happened to the driver"!

665
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,750
Reynard is dead so he can't be driving.

666
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,458
So, Jimmy Harris asks his old friend
Reggie to be the driver.

667
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,291
And Reggie, dubble crossing bastard...

668
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,833
Decoys us and takes the money .

669
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,750
Whose money?

670
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:50,958
Our money.

671
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,041
Fuck.

672
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,375
Well well well...

673
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,416
Allah be praised.

674
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,416
What are you thinking?

675
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,875
Someone has just made 
a very big mistake.

676
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,708
So you heard about Jimmy Harris?

677
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,500
I just lit a candle for him.

678
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,541
Lovely thought.

679
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,583
He's gonna need all the help he can get.

680
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,541
He wasn't so bad.
Always treated me ok.

681
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,208
He was a Quaker.

682
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,140
They didn't have to kill him.

683
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,083
He would have tried to kill them.

684
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,666
If he had the chance.

685
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,791
Quaker or not.

686
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,541
Tell me about Russell Berdvelle.

687
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,380
What is there to tell ...

688
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,166
He is the owner of a strip club.

689
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,291
He is not like Diaghilev
"Russian ballet".

690
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,791
He wanted to now,
why you were looking for me.

691
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,250
I told him that you were
 looking for Jimmy.

692
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,250
That wasn't good enough for
Mr. Berdvellu, was it?

693
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,916
He's crazy.

694
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,875
I had a runin with him before.

695
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,166
What about?

696
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,458
He tried to get me in to do porno.

697
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,260
I told him to get lost.

698
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,166
He got nasty.

699
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,208
He got nasty?

700
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Berdvell!

701
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,625
Nobody moves!

702
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:14,166
Snake!

703
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:15,541
Fuck!

704
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:17,250
You're a shit shot Berdvell!

705
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,500
Nobody cares about bystanders!

706
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,083
Why did you move, man?

707
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,250
Fuck!

708
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,208
Bob, are you hit?

709
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:50,708
It's just cramp. A bad one.

710
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:52,625
Go go.

711
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,625
I'm just gonna breath.

712
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:19,000
Come on little piggy.

713
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:20,958
Come out!

714
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,125
See this ring?

715
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,500
A gift from my mother.

716
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:38,041
It's a nice ring.
know what it's for?

717
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,500
For beating the shit out of
 scumbags like you.

718
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,208
Why don't we just throw him of the roof?

719
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:03,250
I was joking.
It was a bad joke.

720
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,416
Wanna go grab a burrito?

721
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,750
I can't.

722
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,041
It's date night.

723
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,660
A million dollars?

724
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,125
It's a nice round number.

725
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,940
That is my favorite round number.

726
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,916
We do not need a million for pensions.

727
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,041
Not if you gonna get killed going after it.

728
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,333
I can handle myself.

729
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,620
Don't you worry your pretty 
little head about that.

730
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,700
Fuck you.

731
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,916
Besides, fortune favors the bold.

732
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,208
You know where that's from?
Greek mythology.

733
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:37,125
A guy called Thurn said it just
before another guy, called Aeneas,

734
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,666
popped a pen in his ass.

735
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:44,166
It's like my mother said:
You are too smart for your own good.

736
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:46,833
Give me a sec...

737
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,166
Hey, asshole!

738
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,833
You shit in this?

739
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,916
Well there, pilgrim!

740
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,958
This is nice.

741
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,083
Yes, I do not complain.

742
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,916
Don't be getting any ideas, though.

743
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:14,333
I'm only here until everything
 with Berdvellom is ok.

744
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,375
How can you afford this place?

745
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,000
Overtime.

746
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:46,625
Where is Reggie?

747
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,125
Why would I tell you?

748
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,740
We know that Reggie was the
driver for the racetrack heist.

749
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:52,916
Where is he now?

750
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,125
Forcing me to repeat.

751
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,250
Why the fuck wo...

752
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,666
Don't fucking hit me!
I'm only child!

753
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,416
He fled with the money.

754
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,750
How much?

755
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:03,875
A million bucks.

756
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:05,791
Fuck me!

757
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:07,416
A million?

758
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,291
How much do I get if I...

759
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,416
... Rat out your friend?

760
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,208
Yes.

761
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
50.

762
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:16,625
Two hundred.

763
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,833
50.

764
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,375
- 175.
- 50.

765
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:20,916
Hundred.

766
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,416
Okay, fifty dollars!

767
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:24,458
Where is he?

768
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,250
You will not believe this.

769
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:29,500
Fucking Iceland.

770
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,375
They have something called a
"Blue Lagoon". It's a hot spa.

771
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,291
It's outdoors.

772
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:57,140
Probably full of sweaty Europeans
with bad teeth, fucking each other.

773
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,750
You will swim around in jizz.

774
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,250
European jizz.

775
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,333
It was the first film I saw.

776
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,041
"The European jizz?"

777
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:12,416
"The Blue Lagoon".

778
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,860
That or "Doc Savage: 
The Man of Bronze".

779
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,041
Оh, fuck...

780
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,580
Bob?...

781
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,820
Yeah?

782
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,958
How are we going to find Reggie?

783
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:37,333
How do we track him 
down without a clue?

784
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,250
He is black.

785
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,416
How many black people do
you think there are in Iceland?

786
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:47,666
We just keep our eyes open.

787
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,166
Not much of a plan, Bob.

788
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:52,666
- Maybe we...
- There he is.

789
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,416
I have a black belt in 
jiu-jitsu, motherfuckers!

790
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,375
You are not a fighter, are you?

791
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,958
Even Stephen Hawking can knock you out.

792
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,791
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

793
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:44,250
You have no choice.

794
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,458
I should thank you for not killing me.

795
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:48,875
Shut up.

796
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,041
Iceland? What the fuck?

797
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,410
- I wasn't thinking straight.
- No shit!

798
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,916
I panicked, okay?

799
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,583
You would too if everyone
around you got popped.

800
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,291
It was murder!
The guys were surrendering!

801
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,700
Don't look at me:
I hate murder.

802
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,458
- Don't I Terry?
- He hates murder.

803
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,875
They really upsets me.

804
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,480
But more important:
where is the money?

805
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,291
Stashed it.

806
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,583
How much do you want?

807
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:15,166
All of it.

808
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,166
- Fuck you !
- No, fuck you, glass jaw boy!

809
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:22,083
You gonna hand over that
million bucks, or we ...

810
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:23,791
A million bucks?

811
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,083
Yeah, a million.

812
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:28,291
I don't have million?
Are you crazy?

813
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:29,583
Fucking idiot.

814
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,700
You walked away with a million dollars!

815
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:32,916
It wasn't all mine!

816
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:35,416
I gave some to the guy who planned it.

817
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,541
Now you are bullshiting us. Either 
the Webb brothers or

818
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,041
Jimmy Harris planned it.
And they are all dead.

819
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,458
Jimmy and the Webbs were tapped out.

820
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,750
That's way they did it!

821
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,416
Everything was planned by this...

822
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:50,500
rich, British guy named, James Mangum.

823
00:49:51,583 --> 00:49:53,791
Never heard of him.
Where can we find him?

824
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,916
I don't know.

825
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,083
He is this mysterious character.

826
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,958
He has some kind of legal business.

827
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,540
I'll tell you everything I know, but you need to give me something back.

828
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,666
How much do you have?

829
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:05,958
Two hundred.

830
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:08,041
- We take a hundread.
- It's hard but fair.

831
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,250
Pretty fair, man.

832
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:13,583
Okay.

833
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,916
How do you like Iceland?

834
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,833
Not the best place to blend in but...

835
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,625
Upside is I think I'm falling in love.

836
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,416
Baby! Where have you been?

837
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,625
You guys wanna drink?

838
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,458
I got some pretty good whiskey.

839
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,375
- I'm good.
- I'll try some of that, Kimberly..

840
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,020
How long have you known, Reggie?

841
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,208
We're old friends.

842
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,375
You are here on holiday?

843
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,940
No. Just a quick in and out.

844
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:55,958
You are together?

845
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,291
Yes we are.

846
00:50:57,666 --> 00:51:00,166
No, we're not together. I'm
 a heterosexual man.

847
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,208
And he also heterosexual.

848
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:03,708
Well...

849
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,041
Good for you, honey!

850
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,416
You should go to the "Blue Lagoon"!

851
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,750
Very refreshing.

852
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,416
I'm sure it is.

853
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,833
I go there a lot.

854
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,125
I'm sure you do.

855
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,500
Hope you choke on it.

856
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,250
So Reggie is gay?

857
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:29,500
If Kimberley has a dick, which I assume
 she does, that makes Reggie gay.

858
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,375
Possible bisexual.

859
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,458
What if Kimberly doesn't
 have...If she already ...

860
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,750
...closed up?

861
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,208
That's a good question.

862
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,500
That would make Kimberly a woman
and Reggie straight.

863
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:43,291
Really?

864
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,625
With an asterisk.

865
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,958
If Reggie is gay...

866
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,958
Do you think Reggie and Pádraic...

867
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:55,166
Is that an international symbol of sodomy?

868
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,980
You know exactly what this is.

869
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,750
I don't think that's allowed in here.

870
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,291
To be honest,

871
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,583
that's hardly allowed anywhere.

872
00:52:27,916 --> 00:52:29,666
You know what you remind me of?

873
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:32,833
A bloody Cyclops.

874
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,666
I do not know what that means.
And you know I don't.

875
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,791
You never read the "Odyssey" in school?

876
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:39,791
When you stop to surprise me.

877
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,416
I read it in Greek,

878
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,300
Traveling through the 
Peloponnese with my father.

879
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,291
I lost my fucking eye!

880
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:49,208
Calm down.

881
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,791
You still have one left.

882
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,060
I'm gonna fuck them up!

883
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,458
You are not going to fuck up anyone.

884
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,916
They are policemen after all.

885
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,791
I don't want to get in to some kind of...

886
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,416
retribution.

887
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:06,750
Your Lordship...

888
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,875
Specially not in my condition.

889
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,750
But I think you are a
little too cautious.

890
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,916
Do you know who the 
greatest criminal in history is?

891
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,250
No.. I don't.

892
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:20,583
No, you don't.

893
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,500
Because, if you did,

894
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:26,375
he wouldn't be the greatest criminal

895
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,250
in the history of mankind.

896
00:53:29,166 --> 00:53:30,833
Fuck, you're stoned.

897
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,458
But do not worry.

898
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,416
I'll talk to them.

899
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,916
Give them a little reducer

900
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,416
as we say in good old England.

901
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,500
What if it dosen't helps?

902
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,750
Eat your grapes, Russell.

903
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:50,625
Eat your grapes.

904
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:06,791
You shot his nuts off.

905
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:10,166
If you shoot a guy in the
 nuts, he won't rise again.

906
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,458
Who makes these targets?
They are kind of racist.

907
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:13,625
Looks like Reggie.

908
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,333
Where the hell have you two been?

909
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,620
Following up on a tip off.

910
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,375
To where? Fucking Iceland?

911
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:24,500
Yeah, yeah, we were in Iceland!

912
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,083
Bob, that shit is not funny anymore.

913
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:30,416
Not that it was funny to begin with.

914
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,666
Anyway, during your 
unexplained absence.

915
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:37,166
I received a very serious
 allegation of assault

916
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,500
from this guy, Russell Berdvella.

917
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:40,791
Fuck him!

918
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:42,333
No, Terry, fuck you!

919
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,541
How many times do I have to tell you?

920
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,625
His lawyer is threatening to charge
you with attempted murder.

921
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,416
Attempted murder?
He shot at us!

922
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,416
I gave him a couple of slaps.
He is a fucking pussy!

923
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:56,708
According to him,

924
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,750
you failed to identify 
yourself as police officers.

925
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,916
Which is why he fled the scene.

926
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,291
Those are what we call
"mitigating circumstances."

927
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,750
The fact that you knocked
 out one of his eyes

928
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,875
while beating him

929
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:13,625
those are not what we call
"mitigating circumstances"!

930
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,780
I told you that Berdvell was part
of an ongoing investigation.

931
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,083
We are gonna get it cleared up in two days.

932
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,458
Well, you better!

933
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,375
Cause, this shit is not going away.

934
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,416
Meanwhile I had to release the prick.

935
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:25,916
Fuck me.

936
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,916
It is I who have to take the hard words
from the bosses above me!

937
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:32,333
So please, guys,

938
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,083
slowly, slowly catching monkey!

939
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,083
- You got it?
- Got it.

940
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:48,833
Hey, shorty!

941
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,083
Where do we find James Mangum?

942
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,708
Get out immediately!

943
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,500
This is private property.

944
00:55:57,583 --> 00:55:58,791
Get out of here!

945
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,083
What are you doing?

946
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,250
Ohh, no, no!

947
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,500
Come back, bastard!

948
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:08,958
Help!

949
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,833
He comes only for the weekend ...

950
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,708
to look over his horses.

951
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,250
He lives in town.

952
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:20,541
Where in the town?

953
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:21,833
I do not know.

954
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,833
I do not know! Honestly!

955
00:56:32,166 --> 00:56:33,833
Give back my fucking wig ...

956
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,458
Give me back my wig.

957
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,750
Put the wig back.

958
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,500
Man, I'm sorry, I did not mean to.

959
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,291
You ruined it!

960
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,083
No, it's ok!

961
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:46,416
Ruined it!

962
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,875
No, It's great!

963
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,291
You take it!

964
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,416
I am hungry and homeless, please help.

965
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,260
Hey kid, you got all the time in the
world to get a better job than this.

966
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,708
It's "Homeless" and not "homless".

967
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,820
You started with the letters to big here and
 you had to scrunch them up at the end.

968
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,416
It is a bad presentation.

969
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:14,083
That's why you are broke.
Lazy piece of work.

970
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:15,958
Leave him alone.

971
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,083
Thank you.

972
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,791
Have you softened with age?

973
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:21,666
Need a hug?

974
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,375
No Glen Campbell!
Unbelievable...

975
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,958
Try some Elvis. They 
probably got some Elvis?

976
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,620
You know that he died on the toilet?

977
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:31,958
He and Judy Garland.

978
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:36,166
- What did they do...
- Not at the same time.

979
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,083
What are you doing?

980
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:44,958
Hey, kid!

981
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:49,083
- Get off me
- Easy! I will not hurt you!

982
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:52,291
Gotcha.

983
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:53,875
Is my mom in jail?

984
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,875
Yes, for killing your dad.

985
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,420
She is not at the beach.

986
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:00,416
What?

987
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,083
You going to arrest me?

988
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:03,480
No. Why would we?

989
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,333
Are you a gangster?

990
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,875
You look like a beggar.

991
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,541
Why did she kill him?

992
00:58:10,666 --> 00:58:12,541
Why did your mom kill your dad?

993
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,625
All right, we're good.

994
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,250
You can talk to us.

995
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,875
What are we going to do?

996
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,916
We got to call social services.

997
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,380
Might as well sell him to the Philippines.

998
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,083
Do you want to adopt a "homless" kid?

999
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,750
- No.
- Why not?

1000
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,125
I'm not putting him back on the street.

1001
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,540
Do you think it is 
easy to look after a kid?

1002
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,291
I have two, and it's not easy!

1003
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,125
Of course, I love them.

1004
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:42,666
But I got to feed them 24 h a day!

1005
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:44,250
Guzzle as vacuum cleaners!

1006
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,375
- It's hard work.
-Are you saying that I shouldn't have a child?

1007
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:48,750
Yes!

1008
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:49,875
Give me a chance.

1009
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,666
Give me a chance.

1010
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,666
No.

1011
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:01,750
What the hell, Terry?

1012
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,291
I'm working on a case, baby.

1013
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,208
And Danny here is a star witness.

1014
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,333
As in the film,

1015
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,916
that kid who died.

1016
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,875
In what film? What kid?

1017
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,416
I can't remember.

1018
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:18,958
You know that booze destroys memory?

1019
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:20,291
Yes I know.

1020
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:24,625
One of the few things in
 life I can be thankful for.

1021
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,875
Just throw your stuff in
 one of the spare rooms.

1022
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:30,666
Good boy.

1023
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:32,750
Did you eat?

1024
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:34,166
Yes, ma'am.

1025
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,916
Then go into the shower.
I will bring a towel.

1026
00:59:39,166 --> 00:59:41,916
Dolores got you hooked
 in her feminist crap?

1027
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,833
Can feminists still wear sexy shorts?

1028
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,250
Yes they can.

1029
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,458
Don't be such a misogynist.

1030
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:53,660
And don't change the subject?

1031
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,708
How long should he stay?

1032
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,458
I do not know.
For how long will you stay?

1033
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:00,708
It's not fair.

1034
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,291
I was in trouble.

1035
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,958
So is he, baby.

1036
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:09,375
We are just your "ordinary"
 everyday family.

1037
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:26,875
For members only.

1038
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,458
What does that say?

1039
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,375
It says you are a member.

1040
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,416
Damn right, baby.

1041
01:00:59,666 --> 01:01:00,666
Sorry!

1042
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:03,041
Where can I find James Mangum?

1043
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,375
How should I know?

1044
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:05,750
Where does he live?

1045
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,700
I say it again:
How should I know?

1046
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,875
He owns this club, right?

1047
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,333
That doesn't mean that 
I know where he lives.

1048
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,583
How often is he here?

1049
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,541
Every now and again.
Should you have a drink or not?

1050
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,791
Yes, I want a drink.

1051
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:21,166
"Bloody Mary".

1052
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,458
The bloodier, the better.

1053
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,583
Okey.

1054
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:40,250
- Are you serious?
- You can't come in here looking like that.

1055
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,583
- You can't come in.
- Do you see that guy?

1056
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:44,791
He's a cop. He will kick 
the shit out of you...

1057
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:45,916
Okay, go.

1058
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,250
Fuck you, Jeeves.

1059
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,125
I see that Iceland paid off handsomely?

1060
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,020
Here is only ten thousand.

1061
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,250
We agreed fifty.

1062
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,458
Reggie had to pay off some 
named James Mengenu.

1063
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:01,916
James Mangum ...

1064
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:05,208
- You know him?
- Yes, he is often on the fights?.

1065
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,458
He has a couple of his men.

1066
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,958
He owns a restaurant in this hotel.

1067
01:02:10,333 --> 01:02:12,458
Must be crowded.

1068
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,833
- Want to see the rest of the money?
- Here we go ...?

1069
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,916
Hang out here and if you see
him give me a call.

1070
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,583
Okay.

1071
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:23,250
Still though ... happy days!

1072
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,180
You are not really happy...

1073
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,500
just a chemical reactions in the brain.

1074
01:03:45,916 --> 01:03:46,958
Hey, it is me, honey.

1075
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:49,416
Only me.

1076
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:54,500
It's just a dream.

1077
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:01,875
Only a dream.

1078
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,125
What is that?

1079
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,291
A large Chinese plastic cat.
What does it looks like?

1080
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,580
It is supposed to bring good luck.

1081
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,958
Or maybe not?

1082
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:57,583
That's it?

1083
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:01,166
That's all you got?

1084
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:06,416
You have to do a lot
 better than that boys.

1085
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,833
It can get a lot worse, fagot.

1086
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Believe me.

1087
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,500
Worse, you say?

1088
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,666
It can get a lot worse, haa?

1089
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:24,958
What are you gonna do?

1090
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:27,916
You gonna cut me?

1091
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,041
You gonna abuse me?

1092
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,125
You gonna rape me?

1093
01:05:39,791 --> 01:05:41,666
Let me tell you a little secret.

1094
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:46,916
There's nothing you can do to me
that ain't already been done.

1095
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,208
So go ahead.

1096
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,333
Do your worst.

1097
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,625
What do you want us to do?

1098
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,958
I don't think the boys will be too
keen on killing a cop.

1099
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,708
Boss!

1100
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:25,708
Boss!

1101
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,500
Hello.

1102
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:21,666
Sonofabitch...

1103
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,208
You should see the other guy ...

1104
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,750
He is totally unscathed.

1105
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:39,708
Baby, come on?

1106
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,458
I'm ok.. I'm ok.

1107
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,583
It looks much worse than it is.

1108
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:48,958
I'm ok.

1109
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:51,083
Do not Cry. I'm ok.

1110
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,125
I'm sorry I scared you.

1111
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,083
Kiss my bloody lips.

1112
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,833
It got to be Mangum, right?

1113
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,958
Obviously someone we have upset.

1114
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,875
That could be anybody.

1115
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:10,958
You look like Adam Ant.

1116
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:12,791
Remember him?

1117
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:13,958
Fuck you, hippie.

1118
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:16,100
Shouldn't you be waiting for the Brit?

1119
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:19,625
I was kicked out. But he is still in there.

1120
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:21,833
Enjoy a delicious lunch.

1121
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:25,500
Really nice I suppose.

1122
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,458
Any distinguishing features?

1123
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,666
Yes. He's sitting with a bunch of Japs.

1124
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,041
Can't miss him.

1125
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,291
James!

1126
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,041
There you are!

1127
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,208
He is right there.

1128
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:43,041
Hey!

1129
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:44,791
How are things, man?

1130
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,125
Oh, this is awkward ...

1131
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:57,750
You are not going to
 introduce us to your dad?

1132
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,416
This is Mr. Okiyama

1133
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,208
and Mr. Murakava we are business partners.

1134
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,958
Ms. Ito, their interpreter.

1135
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,250
Mr Bolano

1136
01:09:08,875 --> 01:09:09,916
and Mr. Monroe -

1137
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:11,875
They are policemen.

1138
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Why so formal?

1139
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,208
I'm Bob. And this is Terry.

1140
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:18,833
Nice to meet you.
That was easier, right?

1141
01:09:19,166 --> 01:09:20,458
Can I have the lobster?

1142
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:21,958
I love lobster.

1143
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,500
What do you got there Bob?

1144
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:29,250
I think it's veal. Om-Nom-nom!

1145
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,416
Some wine, perhaps?

1146
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,208
No, we can not drink
 while we are on duty.

1147
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:36,333
That would be illegal.

1148
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,020
Is everything all right, sir?

1149
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,333
Yes, it's fine. I would like the bill, please.

1150
01:09:41,833 --> 01:09:43,041
Simply fantastic!

1151
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:47,166
I ever told you about that time I
puked Indian food from my nose?

1152
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,375
Gentlemen,

1153
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,580
Is this a social visit or do you have
a reason for embarrassing me?

1154
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,333
We are not embarrassing you, are we Terry?

1155
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,500
Why would we?

1156
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:55,875
We just wanted to say,

1157
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:57,375
that we know all about you.

1158
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,500
and we are on to you.

1159
01:09:58,625 --> 01:09:59,666
You know nothing about me.

1160
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:00,875
Oh, Story time!

1161
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,041
I'm a legitimate businessman.

1162
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:06,791
And if you think you can play
any dirty little tricks on me,

1163
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:09,500
I think you will find 
yourselves sadly mistaken.

1164
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:13,916
I don't think you understand, you little shit.

1165
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,291
You see, we don't live in your world,

1166
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,583
You live in ours.

1167
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,583
You know that 800 grand?

1168
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,625
800 thousand fucking dollars,

1169
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,416
That's ours.

1170
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:24,958
That's not yours.

1171
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,060
You have until tonight to hand
 it over, and if you don't

1172
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,940
you're gonna be fucked.

1173
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,500
So, make sure you give us a call.

1174
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,125
You got that?

1175
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,666
How is that lobster, Terry?

1176
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,041
Tasty.

1177
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,875
Want some dessert?

1178
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,250
No, I got to watch the waist line here.

1179
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,666
We should do this again some time!

1180
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,220
I look forward to it. You are
pleasant company.

1181
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,708
Terry, that was sarcasm!

1182
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:58,666
The lowest form of humor, Bob.

1183
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:01,750
Sayonara!

1184
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:03,833
Arigato!

1185
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,875
Godbye!

1186
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,250
So Mangum got his sharks involved, huh.

1187
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:18,416
I must say,

1188
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,750
I am disappointed.

1189
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:22,140
I feel like you let me down.

1190
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:27,125
You can't harass people like that and
think you can get away with it.

1191
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,060
If the guy was an Arab, then yeah. But
 this is a Brit we're talking about!

1192
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,583
He is a Lord, apparently!

1193
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,333
He has an OBI or something ...

1194
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,916
OBI? What is that?

1195
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,875
It's a part of the British Empire.
It don't mean a shit.

1196
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:41,250
It means something to the Brits!

1197
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:42,583
I'm a Prince!

1198
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,416
It just ain't right!

1199
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,583
It ain't right.

1200
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,420
Not to mention having cars
 blown up outside your house.

1201
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,666
and you have been half beaten to death.

1202
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:53,333
only a problem with my wife.

1203
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,458
It wasen't even my car. I do not go by jeep.

1204
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:57,416
They guzzle fuel like the devil!

1205
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,100
- Probably Greenpeace who set fire to it.
 - Evil!

1206
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:00,875
Assholes!

1207
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,291
I know!

1208
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:04,041
Are you done?

1209
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,333
- Yes
- Okay.

1210
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,700
I gonna need your guns too.

1211
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:10,875
Think I care!

1212
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:13,708
I don't even like this gun.

1213
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,820
And clear out your desks.

1214
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:20,541
There is nothing in my desk.

1215
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:23,916
Except that triple murder
 from three years ago.

1216
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:25,700
Ohh yeah! I wounder who did that?

1217
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,700
We may never know.

1218
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:27,791
Bob!

1219
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:29,666
I'm telling you this as a friend:

1220
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,125
He will destroy you.

1221
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,208
You know that, don't you?

1222
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,583
With all due respect,

1223
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:36,916
You were never a friend of mine.

1224
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:40,375
You are more of a glorified bastard.

1225
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:45,416
Bernalillo County
Correctional institution

1226
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,666
I'm staying with Terry and his girlfriend.

1227
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,333
They got this very cool place.

1228
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,541
That's good.

1229
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,083
It will only be till you get out.

1230
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,140
Terry says, you have a good
chance getting off with the trial.

1231
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,375
Then we can live together again.

1232
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,250
With your husbands record and

1233
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:07,416
together with some other shit ...

1234
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,700
Like history of domestic 
violence or something...

1235
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,250
That's not why I killed him.

1236
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:15,750
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:13:20,208 --> 01:13:21,458
So, so sorry.

1238
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:31,375
It's not fair!

1239
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:33,583
No, it's not.

1240
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,833
Life is unfair.

1241
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,250
Never forget that.

1242
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:48,416
I hate jellyfish.

1243
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,416
I wonder how it got here?

1244
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,700
Maybe it fell from a spaceship.

1245
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,583
Is it true that they can sting you
even when they are dead?

1246
01:14:00,666 --> 01:14:03,875
No, I think when they are 
dead... they are dead.

1247
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,380
They are immortal, though.

1248
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:09,875
What?

1249
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,875
Jellyfish are immortal.

1250
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:15,041
Bob told me.

1251
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,375
Not everything Bob says is true.

1252
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,708
Yes it is.

1253
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,580
That's my greatest fear actually.

1254
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:21,958
Death by a jellyfish.

1255
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,250
Your greatest fear is death by jellyfish?

1256
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:26,500
It is not funny.

1257
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,020
Random death by jellyfish..

1258
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,916
A friend of mine caught a jellyfish,

1259
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:32,916
put it in a jar, went out.

1260
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,083
And when he returned ...

1261
01:14:35,333 --> 01:14:38,220
he reached for, what he thought,
 was a glass of water.

1262
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,750
And now he is dead!

1263
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,480
I am glad that you find it amusing.

1264
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,083
Okay, lazy.

1265
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:49,625
Lets get something to eat.

1266
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,166
- Wait, wait.
- Come on!

1267
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:54,583
I can't run in these!

1268
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:55,708
Hurry!

1269
01:14:57,166 --> 01:15:00,666
"I am real!", said Alice and began to cry.

1270
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:04,666
"You won't be more real by 
crying" Tweedledum remarks.

1271
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:06,660
"There is nothing to cry about"

1272
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,620
We finish reading tomorrow.

1273
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,041
Dad,

1274
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,540
What happens when you die?

1275
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:15,708
Nothing.

1276
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,375
When you are dead, you are dead.

1277
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,458
But is not mother in heaven?

1278
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:20,791
No, my dear.

1279
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,958
What did I say? It's just darkness forever.

1280
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:27,916
Run along and play. I will
 talk to Uncle Russell.

1281
01:15:32,208 --> 01:15:33,666
Growing up so quickly!

1282
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,666
What are we going to do 
with those two pricks?

1283
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,250
They were fired today.

1284
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:50,041
They are no longer police officers,

1285
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:52,250
they are now civilians.

1286
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:53,916
Fuck does that mean?

1287
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,750
It is over?

1288
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:57,208
No, it's not over.

1289
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,041
Now we will kill them.

1290
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,166
You almost broke my cock.

1291
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,208
Can you break a cock?

1292
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,125
It consists of tendons.

1293
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,041
You snapped a tendon!

1294
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,166
Well, I got to take a break,

1295
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:39,708
ruminate,

1296
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:41,666
Consider the options.

1297
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:45,000
I'll miss the police.

1298
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,166
I liked the structure itself.

1299
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:48,291
Structure?

1300
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:52,208
Maybe it's good thing that we got fired.

1301
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,958
I was beginning to worry about you.

1302
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,480
You know when those things
started to happen...

1303
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,700
I'm not sure how much longer
you could have got away with it.

1304
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,660
Especially with Terry.

1305
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:07,458
Terry...

1306
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Hey, Torro!

1307
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,500
Vámonos, Torro!

1308
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,666
Freaking funny, huh?

1309
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:18,208
Yes, it's funny.

1310
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,958
You go, Torro!

1311
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,250
Cool, huh?

1312
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,958
When you got beat up last night,

1313
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,916
did that have anything to do with me?

1314
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,250
Of course not.

1315
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:36,583
Why would it?

1316
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,833
I know why she did it.

1317
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,333
Who!

1318
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:43,541
My mom.

1319
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,625
I know why she stabbed my dad.

1320
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,666
She found out what he had done...

1321
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:56,000
And what had he done?

1322
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Danny,

1323
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:05,375
what had he done?

1324
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,666
He took me to this place ...

1325
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,660
Somewhere outside the city.

1326
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,860
There were these people there.

1327
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,375
They did things.

1328
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,416
You know...

1329
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:28,875
They filmed it as well.

1330
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,540
Do you know the names of these people?

1331
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:55,458
Yes, I know their names.

1332
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,875
Do you know why you're here?

1333
01:20:51,916 --> 01:20:52,958
Go fuck yourself.

1334
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,958
Because I do not like snitches.

1335
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,791
They have no honor,

1336
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:00,958
No code.

1337
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:02,750
Go fuck yourself.

1338
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,060
This is the Lafayette sword.

1339
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:09,166
From the revolutionary war.

1340
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:13,416
Yes, there was a revolution in the
united states, hard to believe.

1341
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,875
I stole it from Masonic Lodge in Illinois.

1342
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:22,125
Have you heard of the writer,

1343
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:24,166
Yukio Mishima?

1344
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,166
Of course you haven't, you are Irish...

1345
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,375
I forgot.

1346
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,750
In 1970

1347
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,375
Mishima attempted a coup 
on his native Japan.

1348
01:21:33,740 --> 01:21:34,791
The coup failed and....

1349
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,340
And Mishima committed seppuku.

1350
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,333
Ritual stomach opening.

1351
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,060
The second in command was supposed
 to behead him in the end of the ritual,

1352
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:46,541
but the poor fellow was so nervous,

1353
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:47,750
that he missed.

1354
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:52,458
Mishima's bloody head was hanging off him.

1355
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,958
Literally.

1356
01:21:57,041 --> 01:21:59,416
Another guy had to step
 in to finish him off.

1357
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,375
Hope I don't miss.

1358
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:04,666
Fucking Brits!

1359
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:06,541
You never know when to shut up!

1360
01:22:16,583 --> 01:22:17,875
Poor kid.

1361
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:19,833
Yes.

1362
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,166
I have never killed anybody before.

1363
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,208
Neither have I.

1364
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,291
You know what they say:

1365
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:36,375
Always be open to new experiences.

1366
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:39,958
I'll do this on my own.

1367
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:43,620
You don't have to get involved.

1368
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,750
How come you always 
look out for me, bro?

1369
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,125
Because you're a good friend of mine.

1370
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:12,958
I got your money.

1371
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,083
You should be in bed.

1372
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,708
Where is our Lonesome Luke?

1373
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,500
What?

1374
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:33,333
I think he's going to kill a bunch of people.

1375
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,125
You know that in Somalia

1376
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,583
only men have gravestones.

1377
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,750
Walt Whitman...

1378
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,208
was buried without his brain.

1379
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,620
Descartes was buried
 without his right hand.

1380
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:55,791
You never wondered,

1381
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:59,083
who created... everything?

1382
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:00,958
No.

1383
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:04,458
It's like:

1384
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:07,480
Where does the universe begin
and where does it end?

1385
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,875
If you can't answer that, then you
can't say that God doesn't exist.

1386
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:19,208
On the other hand, Pythagoras believed

1387
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,541
that after death

1388
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:23,416
your soul go into a fucking green bean.

1389
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:24,791
So what do I know.

1390
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,708
I love this car.

1391
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,333
It's indestructible.

1392
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,666
Like I always say Bob:

1393
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:22,250
if it ain't broke

1394
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,125
Break it.

1395
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:51,958
Detectives ...

1396
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:53,958
Glad to see you again.

1397
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:56,916
Do you like westerns?

1398
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:09,833
I don't have your 800 thousand dollars.

1399
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,500
I was never going to give them to you.

1400
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:16,140
I just wanted to clarify that.

1401
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,208
Not so tough now, huh?

1402
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,041
without your fucking badges?

1403
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:22,541
Listen, man,

1404
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:24,416
l know we don't see eye to eye but..

1405
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,750
Fuck you!

1406
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:39,125
I must say you're taking this
turn of events rather well.

1407
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,125
We did not come here for the money.

1408
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,333
We don't care about the money any more.

1409
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,583
This is about Danny Reynard.

1410
01:26:48,541 --> 01:26:49,583
Danny Reynard ...

1411
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:53,625
I can't...

1412
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,083
quite place the name.

1413
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,125
You know, one day...

1414
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,333
these students were taking a
philosophy exam and

1415
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:15,916
to start the tutor grabs

1416
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,000
a chair and puts it on a desk

1417
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:20,333
and he says: "For your last test,

1418
01:27:21,041 --> 01:27:23,416
prove that this chair exists. "

1419
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,541
So, everyone begin to write.

1420
01:27:25,958 --> 01:27:27,250
Except for one guy.

1421
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,541
He wrote only two words.

1422
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,750
Rises,

1423
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,041
hands his paper to the tutor

1424
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,166
and leaves the class.

1425
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,250
The tutor looks at it,

1426
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,791
and on it it says:

1427
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:39,875
"What chair?"

1428
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:49,166
Well...

1429
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:51,791
That's certainly brave....

1430
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,333
Fuck!

1431
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,250
Bob?

1432
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:47,750
Bob...

1433
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,375
I love bulletproof vests.

1434
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,833
Lets go fuck these scumbags.

1435
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:37,750
I killed your snitch.

1436
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:43,250
I chopped his fucking head off!

1437
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:47,958
Wait ...

1438
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,125
Don't...

1439
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,833
I knew your last word would be shit.

1440
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,666
Okay.

1441
01:30:09,041 --> 01:30:10,666
You made your point.

1442
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,958
How much is this gonna cost me?

1443
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:19,916
Your life.

1444
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,041
Not bad.

1445
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,541
That's a shame.

1446
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:40,125
I kind of liked the guy,
in a funny sort of way.

1447
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:42,380
His hair were resealing quite a bit.

1448
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,708
His teeth was fucked up.

1449
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:47,833
What are you doing?

1450
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:50,083
We will give him a decent burial.

1451
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:52,541
What are we? Savages?

1452
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:56,083
I thought you were gonna keep
him as a souvenir or something.

1453
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:00,958
That story about the philosophy
exam and the chair?

1454
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,875
What does that actually mean?

1455
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,333
It's not supposed to mean anything.

1456
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:07,208
It's a Zen koan.

1457
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,166
Just ponder on it.

1458
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:10,333
Just ponder on it?

1459
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:11,916
Yeah. I fucked it up though.

1460
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,791
I was supposed to say:

1461
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,458
"Prove that the chair doesn't exist".

1462
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,750
Ahh! So it "doesn't exist"?

1463
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:40,083
Man, that was some cold shit.

1464
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,291
What's next, man?

1465
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,166
Gonna live slow.

1466
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:35,833
Die old and leave an ugly looking corpse.

1467
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:37,833
What are you going to do?

1468
01:32:38,916 --> 01:32:39,916
I don't  know.

1469
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,916
Something sedate.

1470
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:46,708
Are you capable of being sedate?

1471
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
It's like the Buddha once said ...

1472
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:52,750
You're quoting fucking Buddha now?

1473
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:55,166
"Do not dwell in the past

1474
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:57,708
do not dream of the future.

1475
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,666
concentrate the mind on 
the present moment."

1476
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:11,666
I love this song.

1477
01:33:12,666 --> 01:33:14,041
Great song.

1478
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:17,958
Masterpiece.

1479
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,950
