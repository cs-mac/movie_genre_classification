We like to think of ourselves
as being ahead of the curve.

168
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,699
One teacher for each subject.

169
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,262
I guess that makes you
our very own Ms. Math.

170
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,932
[laughs]

171
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,668
We may want
to lighten up the decor,

172
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:12,207
something cheery
and "math is fun"-ish.

173
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,652
- You made a mistake.

174
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,283
I'm not a teacher.

175
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,315
I--

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,588
- There's an old saying:

177
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,893
"No one is a teacher
until they're a teacher."

178
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,429
- I had math in this room
with Mr. Jones.

179
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,376
- 1, 2, 3,

180
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,440
5, 8,

181
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:49,386
13, 21...

182
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,449
Who can tell me the next number
in this pattern?

183
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,051
Miss Gray?

184
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,563
- 34.

185
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,796
- You are correct!

186
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,631
- I never saw him without
a wax number around his neck.

187
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,477
The numbers varied
according to his mood.

188
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,952
He'd go higher
in a better mood,

189
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,183
lower if he felt lower.

190
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:34,692
I wondered if he had
the numbers my dad needed.

191
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,295
To the world,
they were just numbers.

192
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,330
But to us,
they were invisible signs.

193
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,982
Mr. Jones quit teaching
and opened a hardware store.

194
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,618
And I was the only one
who understood why.

195
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,719
He was trying
to get his numbers up.

196
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,862
We don't talk anymore.

197
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,899
- So can I count on you?

198
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,235
[bell ringing]

199
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,999
[children shouting]

200
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,734
[footsteps clomping]

201
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:53,177
- Hi, first graders.

202
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,679
I'm Miss Gray.

203
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,444
- Miss Gray, you're it!

204
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,644
- Um--
Um, no.

205
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,550
- Can we call you Mommy?

206
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,054
- Oh!

207
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,078
[bell ringing]

208
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,613
Second graders,

209
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,718
look at all the numbers
on the wall.

210
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,022
Guys, please.

211
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,056
[bell ringing]

212
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,836
- No way!
Check it out!

213
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,739
- Pretty awesome numbers.

214
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,610
- I like the 2.

215
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,410
I like the 9 a lot.

216
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,939
- I like the 5.

217
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,918
- Are you the third grade?

218
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,545
- Yes.

219
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,714
- What's your name?

220
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,087
- Elmer Gravlaki.

221
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,718
- Okay.
Thank you.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,285
Sit down...please.

223
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,306
Um...

224
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,310
let's play a game.

225
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,545
How about you say your name

226
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,677
along with your favorite number?

227
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,051
[loud snap]
- Ow!

228
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,077
He shot me!

229
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,248
[laughter]

230
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,224
It's not funny!

231
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,954
- What's your name?

232
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,427
- Danny O'Mazzi.

233
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,794
- Danny, you can't shoot people
in the head,

234
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,595
so go stand in the corner
and face the wall.

235
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,601
- Cool.

236
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,795
- No fair!

237
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,497
Why does he get to stand
in the corner

238
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,732
facing the wall?

239
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,433
- Well, it's not supposed to be
a good thing.

240
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,408
It's supposed to be
a punishment.

241
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,070
- Miss Gray, I'm Rita Williams,
and I want you to know

242
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,672
that Ellen always pees
when she gets nervous.

243
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,614
She has a change of clothes
in a cubby

244
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,016
in the nurse's office.

245
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,816
- Go and do that, then, Ellen.

246
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,223
- Miss Gray, I'm Lisa Venus,

247
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,818
and my favorite number
is a billion.

248
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:49,850
- What?

249
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,489
- You told us to say our name
and our favorite number.

250
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,692
- Yeah, get with the program.

251
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,166
- And you are...

252
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,692
- Ann DiGanno.

253
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:07,136
- Lisa, how about choosing
a number between 1 and 9?

254
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,840
- 9--I mean...

255
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,576
2--
no, 7.

256
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,311
- 7?

257
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,717
- For sure 7.

258
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,311
- Okay.

259
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,550
Do I have any other volunteers?

260
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,354
- Ooh, ooh, me, me.

261
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,519
Oh, oh, me.
Pick me.

262
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,085
My name is Levan Beeze,

263
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,063
and my favorite number is 1.

264
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,326
- Okay.

265
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,563
Levan, you and Lisa

266
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,596
come to the front and form
your numbers with your bodies.

267
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,206
- What is this?

268
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,941
- And what's the total
of Levan and Lisa?

269
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,075
- 8.

270
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,414
- That's right.

271
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,511
- The bugs in her gross hair
gave her the answer.

272
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,954
- I don't have bugs in my hair.

273
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,218
- Ann's in a bad mood

274
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,123
because her parents
are getting divorced.

275
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,252
My mom is her mom's attorney.

276
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,819
- They're not getting divorced!

277
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,854
They're getting
legally separated.

278
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,029
- Levan, client-attorney
confidentiality is confidential.

279
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,229
Shh.

280
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,035
All right, who wants
to be the 8?

281
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,097
- I'll do it.

282
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,768
- Okay, Danny.

283
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,269
Who wants to be
the plus sign?

284
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,607
- Me!
- Pick me!

285
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,456
- This is our first
human equation.

286
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,483
[laughter]

287
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,756
- Cool.

288
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,026
- What are we gonna do now?

289
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:41,403
- How about if we...

290
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,170
How about, uh...

291
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,112
What if we...

292
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,587
make numbers out of nature?

293
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:00,422
One of you will bring in
a number

294
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,427
every Friday,

295
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,624
kind of like a show-and-tell
with numbers.

296
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,656
And we'll call it...

297
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,137
"numbers and materials."

298
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,570
- Can I go first?

299
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,803
- Okay, Lisa Venus,
bring in a good one.

300
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,209
Okay.

301
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:26,009
- I'm glad
you're the new math teacher.

302
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,757
- Dad?

303
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,193
Dad!

304
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,530
Dad!

305
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,324
Dad!

306
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,858
Today was my first day--

307
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,063
- [exhaling]

308
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,300
[laughing]
Mona, Mona...

309
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,205
I read about this in a book

310
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,143
by a Harvard medical professor.

311
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,842
This is called
"the shape of health."

312
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,913
Come here.
Let me show you.

313
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,978
Let me show you.
Come here.

314
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,216
Come here.

315
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,419
All right, now,
according to this book,

316
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,986
Olympic athletes who were hurt,
they used this, right?

317
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,258
They've done studies.

318
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,198
The damage goes out

319
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:19,568
through the gap in the circle.

320
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,335
Honey, it's a reliable book.

321
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,436
You want to--
you want to come in?

322
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,741
Just come on in.

323
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,842
You can feel it, right?

324
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,445
Honey, just sit here.
Sit right here.

325
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,650
And just take a deep breath in,
right?

326
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,989
And then just let it all out
through the gap.

327
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,016
[inhaling]

328
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,086
Deep breath.

329
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,619
[inhaling]

330
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,892
And let it all out.

331
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,422
[exhales]
Let go. Let go. Let go.

00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,225
Start it again.

00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,398
In...
[inhaling]

335
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,566
And out.

336
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,074
[exhaling]

337
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,475
- What's going on?

338
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,644
- It's called
"the shape of health."

339
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,612
- I'm calling Dr. Wallace.

340
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,817
These medications
are not working either.

341
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,347
And you're not helping.

342
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:18,796
- Hey, I have a doctor
from the Harvard medical school.

343
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,561
[bell ringing]

344
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,618
- Rock candy experiment
gone awry.

345
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,860
It makes a mess,
but the kids love it.

346
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,360
These are never filled.

347
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,100
[sighs]

348
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,337
This your sherbert?

349
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,707
- No.

350
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,406
- It's a funny name, right?

351
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,005
Sherbert.

352
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,978
Like, if you say it
a bunch of times, it's--

353
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,509
Sherbert.

354
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,513
Sherbert.

355
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,720
Sherbert.

356
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,352
I guess it's not really
that funny,

357
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,885
but it's a weird name.

358
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,192
Sherbert.

359
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,900
So you're the new math teacher?

360
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,461
You're Miss Gray?

361
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,530
- Uh-huh.

362
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,372
- I'm Ben.

363
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,243
Ben Smith.
I teach science.

364
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,043
- What were you thinking

365
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,311
with that houseplant assignment?

366
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,749
- Oh, the houseplant assignment.

367
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,515
Half the class was supposed to
talk kindly to their houseplants

368
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,988
and the other half wasn't,

369
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,925
and then we were gonna compare
their respective growth rates.

370
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,552
Why?
What's up?

371
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,222
- Rita Williams' mother
found her

372
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,595
yelling at her bathroom fern,

373
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,031
saying things like,

374
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,365
"You're a disgrace
to the family name,"

375
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,304
and, "What are you looking at,
you...

376
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,330
skanky piece of bitch?"

377
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,172
- What was the plant's reaction?

378
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,771
- Now, don't you get cheeky.

379
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,544
Shall we discuss this
in my office, Mr. Smith?

380
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:23,282
- We have to discuss this
in your office.

381
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,620
See you around, Miss Gray.

382
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,855
- Miss Gray,
the 7 of the clouds fell.

383
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,763
Miss Gray.

384
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,539
- Hey!
Watch it, doody-boy!

385
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,540
- Sorry.

386
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,371
[laughter]

387
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,172
- What is she wearing?

388
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,769
- It looks like garbage.

389
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,646
- Lisa Venus...

390
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,083
- Yes?

391
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,711
- What's that on your head?

392
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,415
- It's an I.V.

393
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,924
Get it?
Those are my initials.

394
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,016
- No, they're not.

395
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,924
- Those aren't your initials.

396
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
- They almost are.

397
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,989
- You're retarded.

398
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,794
- Ann.

399
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,961
- I'm ready
for "numbers and materials."

400
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,233
- "Numbers and materials"?

401
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,398
- Remember?

402
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,031
Every Friday,
we bring in numbers

403
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,507
from the world of nature.

404
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,942
- Or things that just look
like numbers.

405
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,138
- Duh, Miss Gray.

406
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,703
You never remember anything.

407
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,613
How the hell did you ever
get to be our teacher?

408
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,845
- Danny, in the corner.

409
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,079
- Cool.

410
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,217
- Lisa, numbers and materials,
please.

411
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,929
- This is my zero.

412
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,329
It's from nature.

413
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,630
- That's not nature.
That's plastic.

414
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,432
- Plastic comes from nature.

415
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,371
- It's man-made,
and man is natural.

416
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,341
- Uh-huh.

417
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,037
- Zero times anything is zero.

418
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:58,209
127 minus zero
equals 127.

419
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:03,347
10 billion minus zero
equals 10 billion.

420
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,685
- What?
- Duh.

421
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,917
- [chuckles softly]

422
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,288
Good.

423
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,520
- What's so good about it?

424
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,686
- Ann.

425
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,889
Thank you.

426
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,891
So who wants to go next week?

427
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:16,923
- Me!
- Me!

428
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:17,935
- Me!
- Ooh, ooh!

429
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,995
- Miss Gray!

430
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,272
- Fireflies aren't flies or bugs
but beetles.

431
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,211
And they exist
on every continent,

432
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,577
except Antarctica.

433
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,309
- Why do they glow?

434
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,374
- That's a good question.

435
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:34,282
Mainly so they can find
their mate.

436
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,154
The males flash their signal,
and they wait.

437
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,683
And they wait for the females...

438
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,729
To respond.

439
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,201
[chuckles softly]

[rain pattering]

442
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,069
- Lisa?
- Miss Gray!

443
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,013
- Are you waiting for someone?

444
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,208
- My aunt.

445
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,945
She's always late.

446
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,284
Want to touch my I.V.?

447
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,619
Go ahead.

448
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,988
Touch it.

449
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,025
- [laughs nervously]

450
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,129
Where'd you get it?

451
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,402
- My mom.

452
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,204
She's got really bad cancer

453
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,302
and wears a red wig.

454
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,311
Guess what kind of cancer
she has.

455
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,285
- Uh...

456
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,148
Lung?

457
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,123
- No.

458
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,648
- Colon?

459
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,057
- No.

460
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,061
- Mouth?

461
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,392
- No.

462
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,795
- Throat?
- No.

463
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,321
- Breast?
- No.

464
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,663
- Liver?
- No.

465
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,497
- Pancreas?
- No.

466
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,764
- Blood?
- No.

467
00:23:58,804 --> 00:23:59,896
- Brain?
- No.

468
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,166
- Bone?
- No.

469
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,538
- Skin?
- No.

470
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,440
- What else is there?

471
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,877
- Eye cancer.

472
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
- I've never heard of that.

473
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,681
- It's brand-new.

474
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,210
My mom's one of the first.

475
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,815
She'll die in less than a year.

476
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,620
- Is there
anything I can do?

477
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,156
- I like pirates.

478
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:33,137
I hate Ann DiGanno.

479
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,661
Are you sick?

480
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,144
- What do you mean?

481
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,611
[car horn beeping]

482
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,274
- Lisa!
Hurry up!

483
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,284
- If you want to do something
for me,

484
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,446
then never get sick, ever.

485
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,752
- Lisa!

486
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,469
[knocking]

487
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,573
- He doesn't need
a cardiologist, Eva.

488
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,447
He needs a psychiatrist.

489
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,351
- [crying]
What's wrong?

490
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,378
Mom, what is this?

491
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,480
- Nothing.

492
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,287
He's fine.
Let's go.

493
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,657
- Mom.
- Let's go.

494
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,094
- No matter how many times
I asked,

495
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:36,123
the answer was always the same:

496
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,795
"Nothing."

497
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:42,238
Lisa wore the truth
like a crown.

498
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:47,473
She made jewelry
out of saline and plastic.

499
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,948
And all I had
was the word "nothing."

- The short version is,

I moved here when my fiancée
got a bookkeeping job

at the hospital.

with a male nurse.

That was fun.

573

They stole my car.

It's a tragedy.
I'm s--I'm sorry.

I made a mistake.

Turns out all my calculations
were wrong.

into science?

to knowing

It's Mona's birthday.

I'm here to show you
the newest Panida Tool catalog.

- Here's my card.

605

You'll come around.

606
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,139
Have a nice day.

I'm glad you're feeling better,

611
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,720
nine times better
than yesterday.

612
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,883
Yesterday you were a two.

613

- That's a nice thing
for a kid to notice.

614

You are a very good noticer.

615
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,796
- Notice?

616
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,395
I'd wake up in the morning
and think,

617
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,633
"lf Mr. Jones wears
an even number,

618
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,040
my dad will laugh today."

619
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,711
"lf Mr. Jones wears
an odd number,

620
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:04,347

"He must know a number
that could help."

623
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,827
But if he did,
he didn't tell me.

624
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,832
He was just one more neighbor
that looked away.

625
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,462
So I decided to egg his car
every Halloween

626
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,531
with five dozen eggs.

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,189
- So...why do you wear
those numbers

631
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,657
around your neck like that?

632
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,021
- I thought you knew.

633
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,556
- Knew?

634
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,659
Knew what?

635
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,399
I was wearing
an invisible sign of my own.

636
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,207
It said, "Up yours, hypocrite."

637
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,310
I'll take that ax.

638
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,732
- It's $28.

639
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,161
- Do you see
what we can accomplish

640
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,326
if we all stick together?

641

At home, it was an ax.

At school, it was a 7.

A little construction paper
and some glue sticks,

654

668
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,871
Your tongue?

669
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,171
[children screaming]

670
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,677
Danny, what's wrong with you?

671
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:48,736
- Malaria!

672
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,542
- Malaria?

673
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,471
[touch-tones beeping]

674
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,506
[line rings]

675
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,609
- 911 emergency.

676
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,017
- 911, I need to report
an epidemic.

677
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,384
- What's your location?

678
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,355
- What about chicken pox?
Rickets?

679
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,621
You know, you could do...
- Excuse me, miss?

680
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,652
- You could do malaria next week

681
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,459
if you do a really good
consumption today.

682
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,465
What do you think?

683
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,557
- Wait.
What are my symptoms?

684
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,090
- Fatigue, cough.
Let me hear a cough.

685
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,397
- [coughs]
- Yeah, get it deep.

686
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:13,698
- We're gonna send a dispatch.

687
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,535
- [coughs]
- Deeper.

688
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:16,699
- [coughs]
- That's perfect.

689
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,799
Some abdominal cramping.

690
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,810
Bend over, like you got gas.

691
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,402
- Okay, like that?

692
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,811
- Yeah.
Go get 'em.

693
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,815
- [coughing]

694
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,441
- Good stuff, Elmer.

695
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,282
It's like heavy gas.

696
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,015
- What's going on?

697
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,051
- We're life acting.

698
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,080
- Ma'am?

699
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,890
- It helps the kids
understand symptoms

700
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,760
for our health segment.

701
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,926
- You...

702
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,461
are...

703
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,474
fired!

704
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:56,176
- You barely say two words
to me...

705
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,808
and then you fire me?

706
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,279
[child groaning]

707
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,759
[groaning continues]

708
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,861
- Get up, Lisa.

709
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,164
You're not sick.

710
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:21,035
- [groaning]
I have cancer.

711
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,131
[groaning]

712
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:26,007
My mom's wig is made
out of human hair.

713
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:29,706
They had ones that weren't,
but you could tell.

714
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,148
- Come on, let's just go.

715
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,173
- Hang on.

716
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,745
I have a little more cancer
to do.

717
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,812
[groaning]

718
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,997
- Uh, Miss Gray, what's that?

719
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,159
- It's a 7.

720
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,138
- That's not a 7.
That's an ax.

721
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,571
- It's a 7.

722
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,835
- Teacher's big fat pet.

723
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,399
- That's enough, Ann!

724
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,640
- Ann's in a bad mood because
her dad has a girlfriend.

725
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,739
And my mom,
who's Ann's mom's attorney,

726
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,079
has pictures to prove it.

727
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,880
- Does not.
- Does too.

728
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,146
- Levan, no tattletaling.

729
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,450
You're gonna have to go stand
in the corner.

730
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,957
[laughter]

731
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,856
Okay, um...

732
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,396
Does anyone know what this is?

733
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,797
- It's a bird's beak.

734
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,130
- It's kind of like a mouth.

735
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,897
- It's a bird's asshole!

736
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,925
[laughter]

737
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,995
- Danny!

738
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,132
Get in that corner!

739
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,635
So let's pretend it's a mouth,

740
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,909
and the mouth is always hungry.

741
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:43,352
And 179 is less than 255.

742
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:46,948
The mouth always wants
to eat the greater number.

743
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,420
- Psst!

744
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,400
The mouth eats 5,556
because it's more.

745
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,733
- That's right.

746
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,069
This is called
"greater than" and "less than."

747
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,572
Who wants to come up
and do their own?

748
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,103
- What is he doing
in this classroom?

749
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,308
- I'm dying of diphtheria!

750
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,510
[laughter]

751
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,610
- Get out of my class
right now!

752
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,881
Ugh!

753
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:20,857
- Not again, Ellen.

754
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,695
- "Fake sick..."

755
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,095
That's easy.

756
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,328
Fake sick
is less than real sick.

757
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,833
- "Car crash"?

758
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,274
- I don't know
if you can compare those two.

759
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,436
- Yes, I can.

760
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,275
- I was in a car crash once.

761
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,610
I lived.

762
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,716
- "War."

763
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,716
- "Old age"?

764
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,726
- Old age isn't greater
than war.

765
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,853
- This is all wrong.

766
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,522
- Sick is the greatest.

767
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,660
- "Bloody murder"?

768
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,499
[all murmuring]

769
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,062
- Mine is the greatest.

770
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,040
- No, it isn't.

771
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,737
- That's how serial killers
are made, man.

772
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,939
Sad but true.

773
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,941
- "Cancer"?

774
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:20,951
- Fight.

775
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,919
all:
Fight, fight, fight!

776
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,716
- Wait!
Stop it, you two!

777
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,813
Stop it!
[bell ringing]

778
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,689
Stop!
I'm gonna call your parents!

779
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,387
- Her mom won't even know.
- Shut up!

780
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,622
- Ann!

781
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,926
- You should have better control
over the class, Miss Gray.

782
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,526
- Remember to do
greater-thans and less-thans!

783
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,365
Page 64!

784
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,453
Lisa.

785
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:05,723
No person is any greater
than any other person.

786
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,458
- That's not true.

787
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,524
You're the greatest teacher
in the school.

788
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,305
- You know,
my dad's sick too.

789
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,042
- Lisa, aren't you late
for class?

790
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,050
- Ahoy, Ms. Gelband.

791
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,458
- Well, Miss Gray,

792
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:41,022
Lisa seems to be happy
in your class.

793
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:47,868
You must be creating
a very nice environment.

794
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,568
Although I can't figure out

795
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,305
why, for yesterday's lunch,

796
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:59,248
she brought cigarettes,
bologna, margarine,

797
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,945
and a packet
of artificial sweetener.

798
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,080
Did you ever hear
of such a thing?

799
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:08,558
- Sounds like a themed lunch,

800
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,060
a cancer-themed lunch.

801
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:12,960
- [gasps]

802
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,830
Oh, by golly, you're right.

803
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,733
Thank goodness she has someone

804
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,830
as wonderfully stable as you
in her life.

805
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,534
- Thank goodness.

806
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,807
- Well...

807
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,177
see you tonight.

808
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,239
- Tonight?

809
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,614
- Open school night.

810
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,243
8:00 sharp.

811
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,647
- [sighs]

812
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,759
- If we had left on time...

813
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,491
- No.
Why don't you back off?

814
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,465
- Why don't you back off?
We're here.

815
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,967
We should see
all of Ann's teachers.

816
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,525
- Well, let's see
the math teacher last.

817
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,401
Ann said she's
a weirdo-bizarro.

818
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,639
- Hi.

819
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,807
You must be the math teacher.

820
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,408
I'm Lisa's aunt.

821
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,477
- Lisa's one
of my brightest students.

822
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,751
- I always hated math,
you know?

823
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,623
But Lisa's a strange kid.

824
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,619
- Well, you know,
it must not be easy for her

825
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,256
right now.

826
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,596
- Mm.

827
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,432
What about me?

828
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,337
You know, I drove
halfway across the country

829
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,500
to take care of her and...

830
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:35,603
haven't gotten so much
as a "thank you" from anyone.

831
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,104
You know, I was gonna get

- Sit.

999
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,328
That guy right there,

1000
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,200
he's an expert bank robber,

1001
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,638
and he got caught
making his last big score.

1002
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:06,039
But the police discovered
this serial killer

1003
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,738
who leaves his victims
in bank vaults,

1004
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,678
then stuffs their insides
with money,

1005
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,944
so now the police need--

1006
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,109
- Shh!

1007
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,584
- [whispering]
The help of the bank robber.

1008
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,316
- What denomination of money
are they stuffed with?

1009
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:20,755
- Shh!

1010
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,622
- I can't answer that.

1011
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,664
But it's
an interesting question.

1012
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,267
That's my thumb, Miss Gray.

1013
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,210
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to--

1014
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,439
- You better stop talking.

1015
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,141
- Hey, why don't you get
another seat, man?

1016
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,170
- Why don't you?

1017
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,444
- Why don't you?

1018
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,257
- Did you just defend my honor?

1019
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,661
- What?

1020
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,745
[footsteps pounding]

1021
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,774
- [breathing heavily]

1022
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,092
[pounding]

1023
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,324
- Mona!

1024
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,264
[breathing heavily]

1025
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,736
[door clicks open]

1026
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,975
- How did you know
where I live?

1027
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,172
- I followed you.

1028
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,649
But you're fast.

1029
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,656
Very fast.

1030
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,888
- I used to...run.

1031
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:08,887
- Why'd you run
out of the movie theater?

1032
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,731
I recognize that artist.

1033
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,579
Who did that?

1034
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,448
- Paul.

1035
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:32,046
- It's kind of a lonely 7.

1036
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,118
Who did the volcano?

1037
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:42,594
- Ellen.

1038
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,029
- Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah!

1039
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,162
I like that one.

1040
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:51,605
Oh, I like this potted--

1041
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,132
- Bouquet of numbers.

1042
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,073
- And there's...

1043
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:06,812
- Lisa.
A six of eyelashes.

1044
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,050
- [laughs]

1045
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,153
Are they real?

1046
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:14,754
[both laugh]

1047
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,856
- I think so.

1048
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,133
- I like you.

1049
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:27,200
I haven't liked anyone...

1050
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:30,144
like this
in a long time.

1051
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,182
- How long were you engaged?

1052
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,789
- Seven months.

1053
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,690
- Which months?

1054
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:48,254
- December to July.

1055
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,232
Why?

1056
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:54,669
- That's 212 days,

1057
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,332
unless it was a leap year.

1058
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,034
- [laughs softly]

1059
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,477
You know that?

1060
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:14,617
- Yeah.

1061
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,768
- You know that?

1062
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,497
- I have to go to the bathroom.

1063
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,651
- You okay?

1064
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,678
- [breathing quickly]

1065
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,228
[gagging]

1066
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,897
[coughing]

1067
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,058
[muffled coughing]

1068
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,288
- What's wrong?

1069
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,301
- Just...

1070
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,327
not into it.

1071
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,806
- You were with me before.

1072
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,971
- No, I wasn't.

1073
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,311
- What did you do
in the bathroom?

1074
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,408
- Please leave.

1075
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,365
- Liar.

1076
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,139
[children chattering]

1077
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,837
- Class!

1078
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,937
Class!

1079
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,711
I'm Miss Gray,
and I'm a weirdo.

1080
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,152
Who wants to come up here
and be a booger?

1081
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,247
- Miss Gray is not a weirdo.

1082
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,552
- Yes, she is.

1083
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,253
And so are you.

1084
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,318
[laughter]

1085
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,793
[silence]

1086
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,162
- Ann.

1087
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,224
- You're late.

1088
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,862
And it's my turn
to do "numbers and materials."

1089
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,895
- Is it really your turn?

1090
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,497
- I'm not a liar.

1091
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,078
Ta-da.

1092
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,242
See?
It's a perfect number.

1093
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,342
- Awesome!

1094
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,875
- Where did you get that?

1095
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,353
- I made it.

1096
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,186
42 plus 5 equals 48.

1097
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,057
- No, it's not.
It's 47.

1098
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,653
- You didn't make it.

1099
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,360
I know who it belongs to.

1100
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,595
- It's mine, and I made it.

1101
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,896
[bell ringing]

1102
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,174
[children chattering]

1103
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:58,680
- Go on, Lisa.

1104
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,207
- Okay, but don't let her
get away with anything.

1105
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:11,354
- So how about you and I go
to the hardware store together

1106
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:15,524
and we'll give the number back
to Mr. Jones?

1107
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,331
I mean, he'll be so happy
that he got his number back,

1108
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,063
he may even give you a reward.

1109
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,004
- A reward?

1110
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,701
I don't want a stupid reward.

1111
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,267
And you cannot keep me
from recess.

1112
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,474
- Give...it...to me.

1113
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,414
- Weirdo.

1114
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:49,789
- I'll go.

1115
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,804
I'll go to the hardware store
with you.

1116
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,239
Then you can take me
to visit my mom.

1117
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,604
- Hey, you psyched

1118
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,615
for the sulfuric acid experiment
tomorrow?

1119
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,310
We're gonna rock that.

1120
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,515
- Mr. Smith.

1121
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,421
- What's up?

1122
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,255
- Want to come
to the hardware store

1123
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,624
with me and Miss Gray?

1124
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,821
- I can't.

1125
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,625
I have my after-school
science club meeting.

1126
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,292
I have to show up
because I said I would,

1127
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,563
and I always mean what I say
and say what I mean.

1128
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,864
I'm a straight shooter.

1129
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,531
Not everyone is, but...

1130
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:31,437
Hey, listen,
thanks for the invite.

1131
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,534
- You're gonna miss a good time.

1132
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,308
- Mr. Jones?

1133
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,443
- Mr. Jones?

1134
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,960
Mr. Jones?

1135
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,931
If he's not here, why would he
leave his door open?

1136
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,028
- Maybe he was captured
by pirates.

1137
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,782
This way.

1138
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,256
- "And falling on a bench,
he laughed until the tears..."

1139
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,781
- Mom!
Nan!

1140
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:25,157
- Hi.

1141
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:37,935
- This is my math teacher,
Miss Gray.

1142
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:41,375
- Is she an invisible
math teacher?

1143
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,844
- Miss Gray?

1144
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:53,181
This is Miss Gray.

1145
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,118
- Lisa, you want to get
some potato chips?

1146
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,284
- Aye-aye, matey.

1147
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:58,554
- Arr!
Shiver me timbers.

1148
01:04:58,594 --> 01:04:59,583
Well, come on.

1149
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,189
- [giggling]

1150
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,266
- I really like your hair.

1151
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,502
- [chuckles softly]

1152
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:20,415
You can't catch cancer.

1153
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:35,095
- Lisa asked me
to bring her here today.

1154
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,592
- Yeah, she doesn't
like my sister very much.

1155
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,338
But she likes you.

1156
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:49,640
- I like her too.

1157
01:05:57,753 --> 01:06:02,747
Her dad got her into pirates,
she said.

1158
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,286
- No.

1159
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,128
Lisa never knew her father.

1160
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,567
- Well, l--I thought--

1161
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,797
- Would you...

1162
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,568
look in on Lisa
from time to time?

1163
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,550
- Of course.

1164
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,138
[doorbell ringing]

1165
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,171
[frantic knocking]

1166
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,576
Mr. Jones!

1167
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,388
Mom?

1168
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,481
Mom?
Dad?

1169
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,014
Have you seen Mr. Jones?

1170
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,720
Mom, have you seen Mr. Jones?

1171
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,661
- He's gone.

1172
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,665
And I can't find my car keys.

1173
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,166
- Who's gone?
Mr. Jones?

1174
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,192
- No, Mona.
Your dad.

1175
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,330
Your dad's gone.

1176
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,738
- What?
Where did he go?

1177
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:26,833
- I don't know where.

1178
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,503
I don't know where he is.

1179
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:37,514
And I found these
behind the washing machine.

1180
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,248
He's been hiding them,

1181
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,052
and I don't know for how long
he's not taking them.

1182
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,758
- This never would have happened
if I still lived here.

1183
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,059
- Stop it!

1184
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,465
You can't help him!

1185
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,696
And I don't know
where he is.

1186
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,505
- Dad?
- Is that your father?

1187
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,847
I've been trying
to get him to move,

1188
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,215
but he won't get up.

1189
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,685
- Dad.

1190
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:17,158
- The energy
is trapped in this circle,

1191
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:19,252
and it needs to be released.

1192
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,855
- Let's go home.

1193
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,300
- Do you need me
to make a call for you?

1194
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,567
- No, we're fine.
Thank you.

1195
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,040
Why did you stop
taking your medicine?

1196
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,673
- Because they're poison.

1197
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,513
And they'll poison my body.

1198
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,519
- No, it'll help you.

1199
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,251
- You understand?

1200
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,454
I have to dig right here.

1201
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,934
If I don't open this...

1202
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,865
I--

1203
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,774
- Please...

1204
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,512
Let's just go home.

1205
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:19,653
- Don't you want me
to get better?

1206
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,213
- That's all I want.

1207

[children chattering]

1209
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,672
- I have my
"numbers and materials."

1210
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,800
I know it's not Friday,
but this one's special.

1211
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,377
It's my dad's fake arm.

1212
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,404
- Cool!

1213
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,212
- It looks like a number 1,
right?

1214
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,685
- Can I touch it?

1215
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,813
- Pretty awesome, huh?

1216
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,380
- It doesn't look like a 1.

1217
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,392
It looks like an arm.

1218
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,020
- It does too
look like a number 1.

1219
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,520
[children chattering]

1220
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,931
- Why did your dad's arm
fall off?

1221
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,734
- It didn't fall off.
It got blown off in the war.

1222
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,238
Should I subtract now,
Miss Gray?

1223
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,036
Miss Gray?
Miss Gray.

1224
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,167
Miss Gray.

1225
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,198
- What?

1226
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,233
- Should I subtract now?

1227
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,609
Hey, that's my dad's!

1228
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:51,635
- Elmer!

1229
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,978
- Give it back!
[laughter]

1230
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:55,745
- Get back here!

1231
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,843
- Elmer, give Danny back
his dad's arm.

1232
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:59,251
- Give it back right now!

1233
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,153
- Elmer!

1234
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,249
Hey, Elmer!

1235
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:04,418
Give it!

1236
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,586
Elmer, give it back!

1237
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,119
- Give it back!

1238
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:11,030
- Miss Gray,
you can't control the class.

1239
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,533
You're gonna get fired.

1240
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,365
- Shut up.

1241
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,429
- No one cares about you, Lisa.

1242
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,963
- Give me the arm!
- No!

1243
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:20,942
- Help!

1244

[children gasp]

1247
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,846
- I'm gonna divide you,

1248
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,378
subtract you,
and multiply you.

1249
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,357
- Lisa!

1250
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,917
Go stand by the door.

1251
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,087
- Ha!

1252
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,427
- Ann, you need to learn
how to be nice!

1253

- [whimpering]
Oh, my God.

1254
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,766
- l, uh...

1255
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,275
Okay.

1256
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,278
I'm sorry.

Lisa. Lisa.

1263
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,451
- Let me go.
- Stop it.

1264
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,858
- Let me go!
- Stop!

- [crying]
My mom died.

She died!

1267
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,300
Why can't I get cancer too?

1268
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,406
- I'm sorry.

1269
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:32,710
- I'm sick of Lisa showing off.

1270
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,408
- Ann!

1271
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,682
- I'm gonna chop her
into pieces.

[sobbing]

1273

- Ann...

1274
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,386
put the ax down.

1275
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:44,858
- I'm gonna chop her!

1276
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:45,917
- No, you're not.

1277
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,725
- I'm gonna chop her
into pieces.

1278
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:51,164
- You're not gonna chop anyone.

1279
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,724
- I'm sick of her.

1280
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:53,792
- Please?

1281
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,134
- And I'm sick of you.

1282
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,536
- Give me the ax.

1283
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:08,574
There comes a moment
when you look around,

1284
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:12,576
waiting for the person in charge
to help you,

1285
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:17,820
and then you realize
you're the person in charge.

1286
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,294
You are the grown-up.

1287
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,624
You're the only grown-up there.

1288
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:29,968
And you're not very good at it.

1289
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:38,043
Life is much, much harder
than math.

- I got nine stitches.

1296
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,227
- I got 27.

1297
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,560
- 9 times 3 equals 27.

1298
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,225
- You're correct.

01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,170

[knocking]

1303
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,911
I used to imitate you at lunch.

1304
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,718
The bench makes the same sound
as your desk.

1305
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,853
Why do you do it?

1306
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,731
- Why?
Um...

1307
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:45,364
I do it when I feel...

1308
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,908
Alone.

1309
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:53,278
- Then that's why I do it.

1310
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:55,112
I want to be like you.

1311
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,353
- Don't do that.

1312
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:03,381
Don't be like me.

1313

- But I'm alone.

1314
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,626
I'm all alone.

1315
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:42,260
- Not only did you bring an ax
to school,

1316
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:46,757
but you lied about having
a college degree.

1317
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,236
Shame on you.

1318
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:57,000
You're a wonderful math teacher,
Miss Gray.

1319
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:00,811
But you are never allowed
to step foot in my school

ever again.

Ow!

Hello?
[woman shrieks]

- What are you doing?

01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:13,085
Get out of here!

1328
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,918
- You're not dead?

1329
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,253
- Why would I be dead?

1330
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,656
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1331
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,321
- I found your numbers
all over town,

1332
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,954
and your store was left open.

1333
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,259
Your car's gone--

1334
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:24,663
- Get out of my bedroom.

1335
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,167
- Who is this girl?

1336
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,225
- Mona Gray.

1337
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,567
- Mona Gray,
will you please get out?

1338
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,902
- Should I call the police?
- No.

1339
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,807
- But you need your numbers.

1340
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,071
How are you gonna know

1341
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,874
how you feel or who you are
without them?

1342
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:40,541
- Andrea, I'll be right back.

1343
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,571
I'm sorry.

1344
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:49,922
- So why don't you need
your numbers anymore?

1345
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,152
- Why do you care?

1346
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,321
- I care because
you're the reason I love math.

1347
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:56,193
You taught me
numbers were everything.

1348
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,528
And I noticed your numbers,

1349
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,363
and I used to keep
a vertical bar graph

1350
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,199
measuring them
against your moods.

1351
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,430
- You made a graph?

1352
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,175
Would you like to sit?

1353
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:19,117
I left the store open,
I sold my car,

1354
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,019
all because of 42.

1355
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,125
Who gives a damn
about anything else

1356
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,254
when you're wearing a 42?

1357
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,127
- I saw you that day.

1358
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,564
- A marvelous day,

1359
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,398
the tops I've ever been.

1360
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,405
- How did you get to be 42?

1361
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:45,341
- And I realized if I don't have
to be a number,

1362
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,746
I can be anything.

1363
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:55,453
I don't understand
why you're suddenly interested.

1364
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,050
You were the meanest
little girl I ever knew.

1365
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,187
You egged my car
every Halloween.

1366
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,218
- [chuckles]

1367
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,595
You knew that was me?

1368
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,327
- Of course.

1369
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:11,237
What I don't know
was why you would do that.

1370
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:17,411
- Because you ignored me.

1371
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,879
And you ignored my father.

1372
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,276
- What?

1373
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,346
- You never asked
about him once.

1374
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,358
- Yes, I did.

1375
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,917
- No, you didn't.

1376
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:38,058
- One day, you were--
you were playing in the yard,

1377
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:42,229
and I asked you
what happened to your dad.

1378
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,135
He seems faded.

1379
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,744
- Uh-uh.
- I did! I most certainly did.

1380
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,575
You were standing right there

1381
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,241
wearing your green rubber boots,

1382
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,512
throwing rocks at that tree.

1383
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:59,611
I asked about your dad,
and you said to me,

1384
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:01,349
"Shut up, Mr. Jones."

1385
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,260
I should have asked you again.

1386
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,263
I'm sorry.

1387
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:50,295
Maybe that day,
you just weren't yourself.

1388
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:59,739
- I don't think
I've ever been myself.

1389
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:07,353
- So what is wrong
with your dad?

1390
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:14,221
- He thinks he's about to die.

1391
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:17,959
- Do you think
he's about to die?

1392
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,282
- Do you miss running?

1393
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,794
Do you want to know
how I hurt my leg?

1394
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,823
You never asked.

1395
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:53,993
- I'm sorry.

1396
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,866
I've been thinking about

1397
01:22:55,904 --> 01:23:00,068
cutting another shape of health
into the backyard

1398
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:02,440
but this time
with a larger radius,

1399
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,138
because the last one
was too small,

1400
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:08,013
but I'm thinking about trying
one with a bigger range.

1401
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,987
What do you think?

1402
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:18,550
- I don't think I can
keep you company anymore.

1403
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:20,527
- My beautiful child.

1404
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:21,893
It's perfectly fine with me

1405
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,761
if you just want
to wait in the car.

1406
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,573
- He didn't get it.

1407
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:50,423
But I finally did.

1408
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,064
[knocking]

1409
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,773
- Got this in the mail.

1410
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:17,046
I thought it was
a little wordy.

1411
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,788
- I didn't know
what else to say.

1412
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:28,762
- Lisa insisted that l
come see you.

1413
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:34,229
- How is she?

1414
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:37,761
- Quieter than she used to be.

1415
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,751
- I'm sorry.

1416
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,951
You were right.

1417
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,652
I was lying.

1418
01:24:58,693 --> 01:24:59,990
Just so you know,

1419
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,859
next time,

1420
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:05,889
if there's ever
gonna be a next time,

1421
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,459
when I say I'm going
to the bathroom,

1422
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,631
don't let me.

1423
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:22,440
- I'm not gonna be your
bathroom monitor, Miss Gray.

1424
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,709
Mona?

1425
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:36,223
I forgot to tell you something.

1426
01:26:38,426 --> 01:26:39,791
I lied.

1427
01:26:41,329 --> 01:26:43,320
I will be
your bathroom monitor.

1428
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:50,028
- I don't need
a bathroom monitor.

1429
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:51,265
- You don't?

1430
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,481
I didn't mean
to just barge in like that.

1431
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:14,495
- It's okay.

1432
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,588
Thanks for coming back.

1433
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:00,697
[light tapping]

1434
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,959
- Miss Gray?

1435
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:21,621
Alisha Beeze, Levan's mom.

1436
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:26,496
I'm an attorney, and I think
you have an excellent case

1437
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:30,026
against Ann DiGanno's family
as well as the school district.

1438
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:33,939
You could be looking
at a large settlement.

1439
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:37,240
- There's really
only one thing I want.

1440
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,906
- And this one states that
in exchange for your job back,

1441
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:41,744
you agree to drop the lawsuit,

1442
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,911
attend night school
to get your teaching degree,

1443
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:46,943
and promise to never bring
hardware supplies

1444
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,683
into the classroom again.

1445
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:52,984
- Pen?

1446
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,255
- Great show for you today.

1447
01:28:57,298 --> 01:29:00,290
- This whole thing
is so unfair.

1448
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,634
I can't even go on a date
when she's around.

1449
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:06,936
I'm not heartless.

1450
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,033
I'm not.

1451
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,045
I'm just not ready.

1452
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,810
I know that it's awful.

1453
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:23,322
But I don't want her.

1454
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,125
- I do.

1455
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:40,366
My dad's fairy tale
had it backwards.

1456
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:41,636
Love doesn't mean

1457
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:44,645
you have to sacrifice
parts of yourself.

1458
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:53,750
The whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.

1459
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:54,880
What do you see?

1460
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,446
- Look.

1461
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,149
- Oh, yeah.

1462
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,531
Do I have any volunteers?

1463
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:08,433
Okay, my little eye spies...

1464
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:12,428
Isabelle and David
and Kevin.

1465
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:22,141
There were 122 frogs
in one pond

1466
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:25,209
and 57 in another.

1467
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:28,416
How many frogs were there total?

1468
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:31,391
- That's not a good math story.

1469
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:35,994
179.

1470
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,292
- Nice!

1471
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:39,561
- Do you know any better ones?

1472
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,033
- Let me think.

1473
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,126
I got one.

1474
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,333
- Put a 3 in it
and a pirate.
