1
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,442
Papa.

2
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,245
Every thing is fine.

3
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,398
Papa, tell me about it again.

4
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:54,080
It's very different this new country.

5
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,722
A very peculiar land.
- Yes, but tell me again.

6
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:57,797
How I won't believe my eyes.

7
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:02,040
They put raisins in the pork roast.

8
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,118
And butter on your bread.

9
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,037
At least half an inch thick layer.

10
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:11,526
The brandy is cheaper
than water.

11
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,885
But strong enough to
knock kill an ox.

12
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:18,204
But your father can
handle it, Pelle.

13
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,442
Because he's hard.

14
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,963
And children are free all day?
- Yes, yes.

15
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:25,918
Tell me about it again.

16
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:29,683
Wages are so incredibly high,
that kids don't have to work.

17
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,839
They don't work?

18
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:34,482
And they can play all day?

19
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:35,523
Yes.

20
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,242
Don't worry.

21
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,677
Over there.

22
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:43,762
They won't fool me.

23
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,683
Shouldn't take the first offer.

24
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,316
Over there.

25
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:06,886
Your papers, your papers.

26
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:09,636
Here.

27
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:11,797
He's my son.

28
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,878
Is your wife with you?
- She's dead.

29
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,035
We're from Tommelilla.

30
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,718
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering you my services.

31
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,196
That one looks like he'd
be kind to children.

32
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,476
Hello.

33
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:53,277
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering you my services.

34
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:57,321
You should have stayed
in Sweden, you' re too old.

35
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:08,602
Hello.

36
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:12,522
I'm Lasse Karlsson from
Tommelilla, I'm offering...

37
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,683
I'm not gonna take the first offer.

38
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:27,443
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering my services.

39
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:57,881
Lasse Karlsson from Tommelilla.
I'm offering my services.

40
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,277
You're too old, and the
boy is too young.

41
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,319
Pelle, I'm not gonna
take the first offer.

42
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:11,280
No.

43
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,120
You're too late.

44
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,798
You were on the boat from Sweden?

45
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:53,846
Where are your parents?

46
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:24,117
Hello, Lasse Karlsson
from Tomelilla.

47
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,686
I'm offering my...
- Let me see your papers.

48
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:43,118
I'll pay you 100 crowns a year.
Including the boy, your son.

49
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,043
Dear sweet Jesus!

50
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,041
You'll sleep in there.

51
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,676
Any questions ask me
or my assistance.

52
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,360
Stop doing that!

53
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,246
Come back here!

54
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:07,922
Stupid animals!

55
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,481
You'll get me in trouble!

56
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:10,842
You won't get away from me.

57
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,958
You dumb beast!
Do what I tell you!

58
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,360
That's it. Move it!

59
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:22,724
You gotta learn how to treat them.
Hit them on their teats.

60
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,805
The teats or their hind legs.

61
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:33,597
Hit them!

62
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,758
Keep moving, I said, keep moving!

63
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,837
Stupid cows.
- Keep moving.

64
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,405
If you help me with the cows...

65
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:55,838
...and teach me danish...

66
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,118
...I' II share my food with you.

67
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,001
Always carry a stone.

68
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,478
If a cow runs away,
you throw it at her.

69
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,402
You take a good stone.

70
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,559
You throw it and you call her name.

71
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:10,762
Then, she'll come back.

72
00:11:11,207 --> 00:11:13,402
She'll know who's boss.
- What's your name?

73
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:14,477
Rud.

74
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:16,436
Rut?

75
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:18,840
Rud. With the tongue.

76
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,878
Rud, Rud.

77
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,726
If you put your head
between your legs...

78
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:26,878
...and the sub is above the trees...

79
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,119
...it's time to give them water.

80
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:31,278
The larks' song will tell you too.

81
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,677
Rut!

82
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,915
That's my mother.

83
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,519
She can't say Rud either.

84
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,157
Rut!

85
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,959
Here's the food I promised.

86
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:42,876
Rut!

87
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,915
Stablehand!

88
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,558
Why's that cow standing there?

89
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,200
Why's Gabriella there?

90
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:10,204
Why's Gabriella there?

91
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:14,157
The girls can't find their cows,
when you move them around.

92
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:18,045
Aspasia, can't you read?

93
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,035
Just as it's written.

94
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,756
As-pe-sia.

95
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,002
You're saying there's a difference...

96
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:29,998
...where the cows stand?

97
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,202
Kongstrup is back.

98
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:56,157
Erik!

99
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,677
Why haven't you unharnessed
the horses?

100
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,357
Because I want to eat
my food first.

101
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,635
What do you say?

102
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:10,406
I say you unharness those
horses right now.

103
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:11,923
Come on!

104
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:15,802
Those horses are more
important than your stomach.

105
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:01,042
Do you know the punishment
for stealing milk?

106
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,756
You could be whipped for it.

107
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,684
I won't report you this time.

108
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,800
Hey Pelle... I've been thinking.

109
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:22,956
I like you.

110
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,325
So I'll say you a secret.

111
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,035
I know where you can find
a lot of gold coins.

112
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,038
But you got to keep it secret.

113
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,440
A real secret. You promise?

114
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:42,316
Come in here, Pelle, very quietly.

115
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,162
The raven can be
dangerous if it hears us.

116
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,276
Come.

117
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,755
Where are you?

118
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,560
Sir!

119
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,836
Are you here?

120
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,326
Are you here?

121
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:00,957
Jump!

122
00:16:01,447 --> 00:16:03,915
Jump, you stinking Swede!

123
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:07,397
Jump!

124
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:12,880
You dirty bastard!

125
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,275
Do you like it?
- Help!

126
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:15,357
That's enough!

127
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:18,036
I'll turn you both in
to the authorities!

128
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:19,356
I said that's enough!

129
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,358
You, son of a bitch!
- Help!

130
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,119
Erik! I'm warning you!

131
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,598
I'll turn you in!

132
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,279
Get out of here fast.

133
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,478
You're lucky I was
here to save you.

134
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:36,841
Get going.

135
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:03,646
He'll be punished. You can be sure.

136
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,958
On my word of honor.

137
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:08,484
I promise you I'II...
- Kill him!

138
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,358
Kill that filthy bastard.

139
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,000
You really gonna do it?
- I' ve given you my word.

140
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,125
How?
- How?

141
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:19,486
How are you gonna kill him?

142
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,436
With a hammer, I think.

143
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,685
Knock out his brains?
- Yes.

144
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,036
You'll really do it?

145
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,443
He's just good as dead.

146
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:36,403
But who'll read
the cows' names then?

147
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,202
You're right.

148
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:44,916
Yes.

149
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,958
We'd better settle for a whipping.

150
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,802
Then he can still read for us.

151
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,556
But it'll be a proper whipping,
that he'll never forgot.

152
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,876
Yarn for the boy's grey socks.

153
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,879
The patch was for...
What did she say?

154
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,085
The Sunday sweater.

155
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:18,078
Your mother said...

156
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:21,120
...the sleeves should be let down.

157
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:22,436
And...

158
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:24,641
Your mother was...

159
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,719
She was so worried before she died.

160
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,363
She didn't think I could
take care of you.

161
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:33,836
Don't let him wear the socks too long

162
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,875
Don't let him wear them through.

163
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:37,196
Lasse!

164
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:39,115
Lasse!

165
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,036
It's him.

166
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:58,042
Where are you, you Swedish bumpkin?

167
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,400
Are you going to do it now?

168
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:04,080
Yes, yes.

169
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:24,956
Sir, I want to protest
what you did to my son.

170
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:26,961
I want to protest...
- Why...

171
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:27,877
...don't you answer when I call?

172
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,001
Sir, I want...

173
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:36,043
I want to protest about
the way Pelle...

174
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,526
...was...
- You want trouble?

175
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,359
I can report you to the manager.

176
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,117
Aspasia is not going out
to pasture tomorrow.

177
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,356
Is she going to calve?
- That's right!

178
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,359
Did you think she was foaling?

179
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:18,524
You can lie there and cry.

180
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,037
But if one can't read
Aspasia's name...

181
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:22,481
...one ought to show a little respect

182
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:26,435
I know where's Aspasia.
She's the third one from the door.

183
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:28,040
You promised, papa!

184
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,287
Knowing that she's the third
one from the door...

185
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:33,876
Is not at all the same as
reading her name!

186
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,196
You fool!

187
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,758
I'm your father you should
show some respect for me!

188
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,839
Lasse is old and poor.

189
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:44,962
What's left?

190
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,395
No respect.

191
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,437
They can do what they
want with you.

192
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,561
You're short of breath.

193
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,635
You worry about your heart
and your blood pressure.

194
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,477
That's what getting old is like but...

195
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:00,884
...you're young, Pelle.

196
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,317
You can still conquer the whole world

197
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,996
Look at that! I nearly forgot,
Look here, Pelle.

198
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,563
Look, look what I have.

199
00:21:12,687 --> 00:21:13,802
See, Pelle.

200
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,160
I forgot.
I brought this from Sweden.

201
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:22,002
From Tommelilla.

202
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,356
Well.

203
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,640
If we're lucky, we'll get
wild strawberries.

204
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:39,837
Just think, Pelle.
Real swedish strawberries.

205
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,883
Nils, get some water for your father

206
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:45,725
Nils, how about that water?

207
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,366
Keep out over there!

208
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,165
Just what do you think you are, Nils?

209
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:25,561
Where have you been?

210
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,519
Your father's been looking for you.

211
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:29,518
The missus sent me to the store.

212
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:18,075
Let's see what you've got
in your jacket Pelle?

213
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,525
She said no one was to know.

214
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:34,165
You're a good lad, Pelle, come.

215
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,396
If you give me the package,
I'll give it to my wife.

216
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:47,566
No one else will see it.

217
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,761
Cognac.

218
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:07,282
It's mine.

219
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:21,044
I won't move... until
you give it to me.

220
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,563
You bastard, Kongstrup!

221
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,078
I said give me that bottle.

222
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:33,440
You, Satan! Devil! Pelle...

223
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,916
...go and tell them all
how he bullies me.

224
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:37,759
How wicked he is, tell them...

225
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,282
...how he's ruining my life!
- It's all a lie!

226
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:00,836
You'll keep it.

227
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,678
God who keeps his children near.

228
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:21,803
Look at me who's kneeling here.

229
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,562
My happiness is in God's hands.

230
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:27,082
Whatever are the world's demands.

231
00:26:27,607 --> 00:26:28,835
Papa.

232
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:29,997
What?

233
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,044
Tomorrow is the day
after tomorrow?

234
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,243
And the day after
tomorrow is tomorrow?

235
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,356
My birthday.

236
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:42,117
Yes, yes.

237
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:49,517
Pelle, was it the real
thing he threw out...

238
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:52,155
...really cognac?

239
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,403
He poured into the flower pot?

240
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,047
Happiness comes, happiness goes.

241
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:03,277
My happiness is in God's hands...

242
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,086
...whatever are the world's
demands.

243
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:32,040
You ought to start moving.

244
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,046
Put your clothes on.

245
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,643
Pants, Pelle, pans first.

246
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,077
But...

247
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,000
...what about your pocket?

248
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,325
There's something in your pocket!

249
00:27:52,447 --> 00:27:55,200
You weren't out stealing
eggs last night, were you?

250
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,245
I'll be very surprised if
that egg isn't broken.

251
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,806
It's only paper.

252
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:15,886
Why do you stuff your pockets?

253
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,037
It's your day.

254
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,755
Your birthday,
God bless you, son.

255
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:45,963
Thank you.

256
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,886
It's just a simple gift from
a poor man, Pelle.

257
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:25,002
Look.

258
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:29,760
Well, a real beauty!

259
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,366
It's a birthday present.

260
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:37,642
I should have guessed.

261
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:41,120
You look like someone
who's having a birthday.

262
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:42,683
Congratulations.

263
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,882
Happy birthday. It's your day.

264
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,362
They say...

265
00:29:57,687 --> 00:30:00,201
...that you plan to run
away to America.

266
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:02,842
What?

267
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:04,960
Run away!

268
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,036
Do I look like an idiot?

269
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:10,244
You think I'd risk losing
all my savings...

270
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,363
...and be lawless?

271
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,882
No.

272
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:15,966
I want to be free.

273
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:17,482
A free man.

274
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:19,239
That's what I'm waiting for.

275
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:20,556
That's what I want.

276
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,126
To be free.

277
00:30:44,047 --> 00:30:45,241
Pelle.

278
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:48,166
I'll show you something.

279
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:50,716
It's here.

280
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,077
Here.

281
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,957
This is the boat to America.

282
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:02,039
I've got two years left to
work on this damn farm.

283
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:03,720
That's all, two years.

284
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:06,237
Then I'll have enough
money for the ticket.

285
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:09,400
As soon as the manager pays me...

286
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:12,002
...I'll go out and conquer the world.

287
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,885
Over the great ocean.

288
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,277
First to America.

289
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:20,360
China, Spain, Australia.

290
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:23,366
It's out there, it'll be
mine to conquer.

291
00:31:23,767 --> 00:31:26,486
It's all out there just waiting
to be conquered.

292
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:28,685
A man can actually live!

293
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,959
It's out there waiting for us.

294
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:32,806
Take me with you.

295
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,637
Yes!

296
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:40,043
Because today is your birthday!

297
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:45,000
Remember. In two years,
when the snow begins to melt...

298
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,603
...we two will sail to America.

299
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:52,123
You and me will sail to conquer...

300
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,560
...that great wonderful world.

301
00:32:32,887 --> 00:32:33,922
Open.

302
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,840
Surprise!

303
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:42,159
We've eaten wild strawberries
on all your birthdays.

304
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:46,684
Just think, real Swedish strawberries

305
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:50,838
How far is it to America, papa?

306
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:54,282
America?

307
00:32:56,487 --> 00:33:00,366
It's a long way. You have
to cross an ocean, Pelle.

308
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:04,241
Erik said that he wants to sail there

309
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,596
He told me it's the strongest
thing there is.

310
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:12,641
It's soft but it can
hold up anything.

311
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,484
Yes.
- I wonder...

312
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,486
...America and...

313
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:20,802
...China...

314
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,955
...are they made
something like a boat?

315
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,241
It seems impossible.

316
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:31,118
Are those countries drifting?

317
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,558
Or are they anchored
to the bottom?

318
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,123
They are anchored.

319
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:23,962
Kongstrup!

320
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,366
Kongstrup!

321
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:32,480
Come out, Kongstrup.
I want to talk to you!

322
00:35:33,687 --> 00:35:36,326
Your son is hungry!
- The sow...

323
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:37,966
...and the cabbagehead.

324
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,562
Kongstrup, your bastard
son needs money for food.

325
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:47,764
What do you think is going your
cabbagehead to talk about his father?

326
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,760
Come out and say hello to
your bastard son. He's hungry.

327
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:53,561
That lecher, he has kids
all over the place.

328
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:54,922
Kongstrup!

329
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:56,486
Except with his missus.

330
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:59,036
Your son is hungry!
- They say she is a witch.

331
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,482
The monthly allowance for your son.

332
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:03,484
Do yo have so many, you forgot?
- Get out!

333
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:06,116
Get out, sow!
- You'll never take care of us!

334
00:36:06,287 --> 00:36:08,084
Get out!
- He never see his father!

335
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:10,681
Get out, you disgusting sow!

336
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,156
Kongstrup has to pay his due!

337
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:17,116
Kongstrup!
- Get out!

338
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,683
You'll never get rid about!

339
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,682
Kongstrup!

340
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:42,396
Kongstrup!

341
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:10,406
Take good care of your
slate now, Pelle.

342
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:14,159
And stay out of the way of the big
boys, until you can handle them.

343
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,278
But if you won't leave you alone...

344
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,240
...you have to be
the one that hits first.

345
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,564
But when you hit, hit hard.

346
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,155
Listen to everything the teacher says

347
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:28,476
And don't make trouble.

348
00:37:29,607 --> 00:37:32,485
When you blow your nose,
use your handkerchief.

349
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,325
Do not use your fingers.

350
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:35,837
But...

351
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,766
...if you're sure that
no one's looking...

352
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,487
...then you can save
on the handkerchief.

353
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,361
Take care of your sweater,
now that I've mended it.

354
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:46,677
If the teacher's wife invites
you to coffee...

355
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,566
...take only one piece of cake.

356
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,041
She's not gonna do it.

357
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:52,162
Why not?

358
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,045
Because the teacher hasn't got a wife

359
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,362
That's the better.

360
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:58,597
Go on.

361
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,682
B-A says BA.

362
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:06,361
B-E says BE.

363
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:09,041
B-A...

364
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:11,358
...says BA.

365
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,883
B-E...

366
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,719
...says BE.

367
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,164
B-I says BI.

368
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:22,479
B-O says BO.

369
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:25,805
B-U says BU.

370
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:29,397
B-Y says BY.

371
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:33,481
B-A says BAH!

372
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,041
You miserable brats.

373
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,767
Stop it at once I tell you!

374
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:40,395
I'll teach each and every
one of you a lesson!

375
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:43,440
Silence! Silence in the classroom!

376
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,076
Silence! Bunch of barbarians!

377
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,960
He have here a new boy.

378
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,318
We must welcome him.

379
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,075
Stand up.

380
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,199
Tell us your name.

381
00:39:11,527 --> 00:39:12,755
Pelle Karlsson.

382
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,404
And what are you good at?

383
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:20,997
I can make a cow obey me
just by throwing stones at her.

384
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,395
What an ass is he!

385
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,280
And I can make my cows stand...

386
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,244
...still by buzzing like a wasp.
- Swedish.

387
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,080
I can tell time by using the sun.
- Can you read?

388
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,597
No, that's why I've come here.

389
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:35,961
I don't care for your
insolence and sarcasm.

390
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:40,565
B-A says BA.

391
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:43,520
B-E says BE.

392
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,764
B-I says BI.

393
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:49,557
This one, here.

394
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,321
You told me but I forgot.
What did you call it?

395
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,157
Have you already forgotten?

396
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:57,921
I remembered after seeing it once.

397
00:39:58,847 --> 00:39:59,882
It's an F.

398
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,365
That's what it is.

399
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,837
What's wrong with my head today?

400
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:08,163
F, F.

401
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,166
What do you think it's used for?

402
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,838
It's the first letter in f-ternoon.

403
00:40:15,087 --> 00:40:16,839
F-ternoon, papa.

404
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,322
That's right.

405
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:21,116
But your didn't figure that out alone

406
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,118
The teacher must have told you.
- No.

407
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,606
I figured it out myself.

408
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:28,879
You did you're getting clever, Pelle.

409
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,918
There's no end to what a boy with
so much book learning can do.

410
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:59,962
Maybe we'll get roast pork
with raisins, Pelle.

411
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:02,726
Or with apples.

412
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:06,483
They also make it with
apples instead of with raisins.

413
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,282
We'll see.

414
00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:18,355
Get out. I don't want any
more trouble with you!

415
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:21,677
Herring on Christmas Eve!

416
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:23,719
I didn't expect that given from you!

417
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:26,321
If you don't like the food,
then find some other place.

418
00:42:26,487 --> 00:42:28,284
It will be a pleasure
to lose sight of you.

419
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:30,557
Herring, herring
every single day!

420
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:32,479
Couldn't we have had
roast pork for Christmas?

421
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:35,923
A real Christmas dinner?
- Damn you, always complaining!

422
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:39,563
If you don't like it in this country,
go back to Sweden!

423
00:42:40,047 --> 00:42:42,880
You're so damn stingy!

424
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,198
Don't you think we work hard enough?

425
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,927
And you of all people say that to me!

426
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,082
Go to your quarters!

427
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:50,922
Go to hell!

428
00:42:51,727 --> 00:42:53,285
Go to hell with you!

429
00:42:54,887 --> 00:42:56,400
Go to hell with your farm!

430
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,243
Go to hell with you and your farm!

431
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:01,886
Go to hell!

432
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:08,680
Any other complaints here?

433
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,282
What are you doing here?

434
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:51,120
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

435
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:54,438
Yellow-belly!
Why don't you stay with your own kind

436
00:46:14,967 --> 00:46:18,323
Get lost, Pelle. You might
fall in the icy water.

437
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:23,080
Go home, Pelle!

438
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:29,284
You are a yellow-belly!
- So quit following us around.

439
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:37,680
Go home to your mama!

440
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:39,121
I can't my mama is dead!

441
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:40,800
Can you prove you're not
a yellow-belly?

442
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,719
Yes, I'll jump into that water.

443
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,000
You must be crazy...

444
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,078
...jumping into the water like...

445
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,400
...some love sick woman!

446
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:00,958
Just a show those kids!

447
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:04,199
A good beating is
what you deserve, Pelle.

448
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,126
If you had drowned...

449
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:09,520
...I'd have given you such a beating
you'd had sit down for a month.

450
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,643
Because if you had done it,
it would have been your fault.

451
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:15,002
Doctor...

452
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,722
...you could...

453
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,635
...you could use this if you
want to take some blood.

454
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:35,476
Drink this.

455
00:48:36,687 --> 00:48:37,881
It will help your cold.

456
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:46,286
Don't be afraid, Pelle.

457
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,561
I'm not a witch.

458
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:51,516
Just very...

459
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:53,725
...Ionely at times.

460
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:58,001
Oh dear God!

461
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:02,239
You don't even have a mother.

462
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,156
Do yo?

463
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:06,925
It's three years since mama died.

464
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:11,561
She's lying in the lefthand side
of the church cemetery.

465
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:14,526
Do you miss her much?

466
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:19,325
Lasse mends my clothes.

467
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:22,360
She was a good mother, wasn't she?

468
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:27,802
She was so ill and grouchy at the end

469
00:49:28,647 --> 00:49:30,160
And she used to be so happy.

470
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:33,520
But he'll marry again soon.

471
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:36,877
If Lasse can find a woman.

472
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,598
And then you'll go away.

473
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,405
The workers all hate it here.

474
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:49,159
It's as we were God forsaken.

475
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,200
As if we were cursed.

476
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,155
The earth is bloody.

477
00:49:56,967 --> 00:49:58,241
Is that what they say?

478
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:00,522
Yes.

479
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:04,960
And what do they say about me?

480
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,043
That missus has a pact with the devil

481
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:11,402
And turns into a werewolf at night.

482
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:16,766
It's the price you pay...

483
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:19,483
...giving your heart to
the wrong man.

484
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:26,759
If he knew the anguish...

485
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,366
...the suffering that he
causes with his lechery.

486
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:34,003
He's in town again.

487
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:35,640
Why does he do this to me?

488
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:37,923
I married him, made him a proprietor.

489
00:50:38,087 --> 00:50:39,042
Gave him my love.

490
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:41,038
The best I have, I've given him.

491
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:44,119
If he could have given me a child.
- I really have to go.

492
00:50:44,847 --> 00:50:46,599
Now you're afraid of me again.

493
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:51,326
You're a good boy, Pelle.

494
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:55,080
If I had a son...

495
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,077
...he would be like you.

496
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:53,001
Come.

497
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:13,243
And this is where we keep the cows.

498
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:16,364
Papa, it's the missus.

499
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,200
It's the missus
with the young lady.

500
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,402
My God!

501
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,283
Pelle, go forward.

502
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,278
Pelle, where's your father?

503
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:40,521
This is our cattleman, Lasse
Karlsson and his son Pelle.

504
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:42,006
Hello.

505
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:48,843
This is Miss Signe,
my niece from Copenhagen.

506
00:52:49,527 --> 00:52:51,404
She will be staying with us now.

507
00:52:51,567 --> 00:52:52,477
Hello.

508
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:26,804
I've forgotten what 2 times 2 are.

509
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:31,762
May be I'm a bit rusty
on the subject...

510
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:33,838
...but I think the answer is
the same as in addition.

511
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:37,205
2 and 2 are 5.

512
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:46,683
What's lighter? A ton
of feathers or a ton of lead?

513
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:49,320
Now you!
- Sit down.

514
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:54,763
If you don't mind I'd like to hear
that question again, Pelle.

515
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,082
Repeat, please.

516
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,719
Which is lighter? A ton of
feathers or a ton of lead?

517
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:56,038
Well, what have we here?

518
00:54:58,207 --> 00:54:59,606
Where is the herring?

519
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:01,646
I eat nothing but herring.

520
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:07,477
Do you know the difference
between you and a buttock?

521
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:08,762
No.
- No?

522
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:11,565
I don't know either.

523
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,158
Erik, did you hear what I asked?

524
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:18,726
I'm ask for a favour, Lasse.

525
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:21,526
Can you take my place
at the chaff-cutter tonight?

526
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:23,235
But it's saturday.

527
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,645
Yes, I wanna get
a bit of... you know. Will you?

528
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:29,241
Yes.
- No, not so fast.

529
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:37,760
He's got a way with women.

530
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:39,196
Like his papa.

531
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:41,835
It must be a hell of a long
time ago, Karlsson.

532
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:45,078
It's a real good idea, Karna.

533
00:55:45,727 --> 00:55:46,921
Really.

534
00:55:47,287 --> 00:55:48,925
You like Pelle.

535
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,078
You've always been good to the boy.

536
00:55:51,527 --> 00:55:53,358
Why not move together.

537
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:56,003
We could be really happy.

538
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:58,041
You're too old, Lasse.

539
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,927
My man has to be dangerous.

540
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:02,685
You're not dangerous anymore.

541
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,521
I see.

542
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:06,366
I see.

543
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:09,005
So you're out fishing for young men.

544
00:56:10,727 --> 00:56:12,877
Watch out you don't miss the boat.

545
00:56:16,087 --> 00:56:17,759
Lasse, do us a favor.

546
00:56:17,927 --> 00:56:20,839
Get us some brandy.
- What?

547
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:22,918
If you want brandy,
you can go and get it.

548
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,758
Just because someone is old!

549
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,764
That used to be respect!

550
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:31,045
"Lasse", the girls would say.
"I want Lasse Karlsson."

551
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:35,484
Eventhough you were married,
the girls were chasing you.

552
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:37,520
There was respect.

553
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:45,516
Papa!

554
00:56:49,287 --> 00:56:50,481
I'm sorry.

555
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:53,796
I had hoped when we left Sweden...

556
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:56,686
...that there will be some
money that cover...

557
00:56:57,007 --> 00:56:58,520
...enough to buy a little house.

558
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:03,277
And maybe find a woman,
who could take care of us.

559
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:09,677
Then, we could have coffee
in bed sunday mornings.

560
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,606
We could run away.

561
00:57:12,607 --> 00:57:14,040
Run to somewhere, far.

562
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:15,557
¿Run away?

563
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,639
But think of the authorities. I don't
want to become an outlaw.

564
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:20,523
I know the way.

565
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:22,277
To América.

566
00:57:22,447 --> 00:57:25,405
¡America!
- America, across the ocean.

567
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:28,840
They don't follow anybody that far.

568
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:33,321
We'll get away.

569
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:00,006
What are you doing?

570
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:08,440
Stealing eggs. I was hungry.

571
00:58:08,607 --> 00:58:10,723
For God's sake,
don't tell anyone you saw me.

572
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:18,366
I know who the father is.

573
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:38,756
You've got to swear
that you tell no one.

574
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:42,956
His father...

575
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:46,164
If he found out I don't
know what he would...

576
00:58:47,887 --> 00:58:49,525
To his father a Swedish woman...

577
00:58:51,087 --> 00:58:52,759
...is only a worker.

578
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:56,516
For the love of God,
don't tell anyone.

579
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,761
I've got to hide in here
until my time comes.

580
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,922
Understand?

581
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,802
Pelle!

582
00:59:17,047 --> 00:59:18,162
Come here!

583
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:23,206
What were you doing in the henhouse?

584
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,682
Stealing eggs.

585
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:25,757
Come.

586
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:27,157
Bend.

587
01:00:13,767 --> 01:00:15,439
Pelle, can I have that coin?

588
01:00:15,607 --> 01:00:16,596
My crown?

589
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,086
You're really out of your head.

590
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:21,123
I need it for when I go to America.

591
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:25,156
I'll pay you 10 crown
when I get grown.

592
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:26,601
You'll not grow.

593
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:28,846
Your body is unnatural.

594
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,916
I could be an attraction
in a circus at carnival.

595
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:36,802
At carnival?

596
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,800
Yes, as a monster,
I coud be rich.

597
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,041
What about of letting you
beat me 100 times with nettles.

598
01:00:50,687 --> 01:00:52,405
A 100 good ones. How would that be?

599
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:55,556
Me beat you?

600
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:57,802
¿ What do you say?

601
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:01,436
You couldn't take it.
- Is it a deal?

602
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:12,082
Are you ready?

603
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:35,079
No more! No more!

604
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,086
You don't want I get pay!

605
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:39,406
You hit too hard!

606
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:43,080
Make up your mind.

607
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:44,441
The money first.

608
01:02:41,487 --> 01:02:44,718
Can you tell us anything about
Adam and Eve and the serpent?

609
01:02:47,247 --> 01:02:49,920
Well, we're all waiting.

610
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:55,165
Have you never heard of Adam
and Eve and the serpent?

611
01:02:59,647 --> 01:03:01,478
Haven't you been listening in class?

612
01:03:03,687 --> 01:03:05,803
What did the serpent
promise Adam and Eve...

613
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:08,356
...if they disobeyed God and ate of
the forbidden fruit?

614
01:03:13,647 --> 01:03:15,683
You don't know what
the serpent promised them?

615
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:20,040
The snake in the garden
convinced them that they would...

616
01:03:20,407 --> 01:03:22,762
...would indeed be
equal to almightly God.

617
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:26,475
I don't see how can we let you
continue with the class...

618
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:29,081
...when the children don't
understand the basic tenets.

619
01:03:30,967 --> 01:03:31,922
Are his parents here?

620
01:03:39,447 --> 01:03:41,165
His parents are not in attendance.

621
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:43,166
You may take you seat.

622
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,122
Next.

623
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:46,596
Pelle.

624
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:58,280
Perhaps you can tell us
what God said to the serpent?

625
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:00,806
And God said that...

626
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:02,722
That...

627
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,038
God said that the serpent
must crawl on its belly.

628
01:04:10,487 --> 01:04:12,717
They shall crawl on their belly.

629
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:18,246
And does it still do so?

630
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,399
Yes. It hasn't any limbs.

631
01:04:21,007 --> 01:04:23,396
And can you tell me what a limb is?

632
01:04:23,887 --> 01:04:26,082
A limb is...

633
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:29,435
...a hand, for example.

634
01:04:29,607 --> 01:04:30,835
Very good.

635
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:34,080
What distinguishes a limb...

636
01:04:34,247 --> 01:04:35,726
...from other parts of the body?

637
01:04:40,367 --> 01:04:41,197
A limb moves...

638
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:43,722
...independently of
the rest of the body.

639
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,720
Can you provide the others in
the class with an example?

640
01:04:57,247 --> 01:04:58,646
Ears.

641
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:02,721
Can you move your ears?
- Yes.

642
01:05:03,447 --> 01:05:05,244
I should really like to see that.

643
01:05:21,847 --> 01:05:23,838
So your ears saved you.

644
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,396
I always told you to use your ears.

645
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:37,803
Rud!

646
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:41,961
Rud!

647
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:43,956
Rud!

648
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:47,558
Rud! You idiot! Come back!

649
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:51,926
You'll never get a heaven!

650
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:55,003
You'll never see your
grandma in heaven!

651
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,517
You can have my slate
if you come back.

652
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,245
You can't do that to me!

653
01:06:16,287 --> 01:06:18,517
No! No!

654
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,482
Don't touch that stone!

655
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:06,041
The child is laying there.

656
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:08,203
In the bloody earth under the stone.

657
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:10,801
Yes he is.

658
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,040
Ana killed the child and
now she is in prison!

659
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,158
The crime is on my soul.

660
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:24,161
I murdered the child.

661
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,917
Natural fathers wouldn't do that.

662
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,525
Lasse would never
have done that to me.

663
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,079
Why don't you go and leave me alone?

664
01:08:42,407 --> 01:08:43,965
I see in the night!

665
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:45,799
A bonfire you can see from miles!

666
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:47,919
Its soul burns on the rocks at night.

667
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:51,079
You musn't say that.
You must not lie before God.

668
01:08:51,847 --> 01:08:53,166
The boy is lying up in the church...

669
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:56,239
...in consecrated earth.
- Its soul is under the rocks.

670
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:58,841
I've seen it burning on
the rocks at night!

671
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,804
And the reason is that he
was baptized too late.

672
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:03,276
God won't let him into heaven.

673
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,042
Nils!

674
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:10,836
Who has gone out there
into the arms of death?

675
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,806
It's Nils. He went out with the line.

676
01:10:38,887 --> 01:10:41,162
Let's take him out!

677
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:18,725
Let's get him over there!

678
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,315
Your eyes are young.
Can you see Nils?

679
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:45,360
Blessed is the earth.

680
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:48,759
Blessed is our god in heaven...

681
01:12:48,927 --> 01:12:51,805
The Angels...

682
01:13:20,887 --> 01:13:22,206
He was a good son.

683
01:13:23,927 --> 01:13:25,440
He was my everything.

684
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:29,845
He was... the fine boy.

685
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:34,799
He never spoke an evil
word to me. Not once.

686
01:13:35,927 --> 01:13:37,963
Even though I denied him his love.

687
01:13:40,567 --> 01:13:41,920
He was my son.

688
01:13:43,967 --> 01:13:45,764
And my only one.

689
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,280
May he find peace now.

690
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,118
He had so little of it here on earth.

691
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:08,361
He sacrificed his life to save others

692
01:14:09,327 --> 01:14:10,806
Perhaps now, in heaven...

693
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:13,555
...you'll be welcome.

694
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:28,766
Come on, Erik! Come on!

695
01:14:31,727 --> 01:14:34,480
Two more inches and you've
won yourself a bottle of brandy.

696
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,720
He won the brandy!

697
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:45,115
When will you drink it?
The foreman says...

698
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:46,879
...you have to work tonight.

699
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:48,526
Tonight I don't work.

700
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:51,599
He'll do it without Erik.
I'll going out to found some fun.

701
01:14:51,927 --> 01:14:55,761
No one is going to keep me in
when I am getting some fun.

702
01:14:56,487 --> 01:14:57,886
Can I come with you?

703
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,246
No, not now, Pelle.

704
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:03,795
Not now.

705
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:05,555
In one year.

706
01:15:05,727 --> 01:15:08,799
Across the ocean when
the snow starts to melt...

707
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:11,879
...then we'll go out
into the great world.

708
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:13,640
First America.

709
01:15:14,127 --> 01:15:15,276
Then Australia.

710
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,206
And China.

711
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,241
Out there's the whole world, Pelle.

712
01:15:36,767 --> 01:15:38,837
Where are you going you lazy dog?

713
01:15:39,007 --> 01:15:40,645
You have work to do.

714
01:15:40,807 --> 01:15:42,035
Erik!

715
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:46,242
You had to hear.

716
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:47,601
What do you call this?

717
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:49,360
I must have the flu.

718
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,765
My head is spinning like a tap.

719
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:55,000
That sounds serious.
Let's have a look at you.

720
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:58,803
Look at this, dressed up
in your sunday clothes.

721
01:15:58,967 --> 01:16:00,605
What's this, your funeral clothes?

722
01:16:01,447 --> 01:16:03,517
Were you going to buy
yourself a grave?

723
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:06,242
It's about time we get
you into the ground.

724
01:16:06,407 --> 01:16:08,238
You're beginning to smell.

725
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:10,562
I'm not dead yet.

726
01:16:12,687 --> 01:16:15,884
And I don't smell any worse
than some people.

727
01:16:18,367 --> 01:16:20,722
You're nothing but a lazy
complaining trouble maker.

728
01:16:20,887 --> 01:16:21,956
I'm sick of you!

729
01:16:22,127 --> 01:16:23,116
Go ahead, do it again.

730
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,165
I'm sick of your belly aching.
- Come on, hit me again.

731
01:16:26,367 --> 01:16:28,597
In front of all these witnesses.

732
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:32,676
We'll make a report
to the authorities.

733
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:37,121
Get up and go to work...

734
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:40,880
...or I'll show you the authorities.

735
01:17:21,367 --> 01:17:23,403
The foreman wants you to be quiet.

736
01:17:23,567 --> 01:17:24,636
You're making noise.

737
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:29,286
What did you say?

738
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:32,118
You're homely!

739
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,842
The foreman wants you...
- You must speak a little louder.

740
01:17:36,007 --> 01:17:37,963
I can't hear what you're saying.

741
01:17:38,127 --> 01:17:40,402
You're making too much noise.

742
01:17:40,567 --> 01:17:42,125
Too much noise, little chicken?

743
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,323
You should help us
make too much noise.

744
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:46,364
Come on, sing us a little song.

745
01:17:46,527 --> 01:17:48,916
I wonder if he sings like
a little chicken as well.

746
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:56,083
Run back and tell him
to run his own errands.

747
01:17:57,287 --> 01:17:58,515
Skol!

748
01:18:00,127 --> 01:18:01,924
Run!

749
01:18:02,087 --> 01:18:03,202
Skol!

750
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:07,199
Run to the fuck foreman!

751
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,726
I'm not dead yet.

752
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:18,005
Not yet.

753
01:19:37,967 --> 01:19:39,446
Where are you going, Erik?

754
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:40,797
To rest.

755
01:19:41,407 --> 01:19:42,396
What's that word?

756
01:19:43,207 --> 01:19:44,401
Rest.

757
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:48,280
No, you can't rest now.
You'll get back in job.

758
01:19:49,207 --> 01:19:51,243
You're after me again.
- After you?

759
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:52,876
What makes you think that?

760
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:55,125
The others are resting.

761
01:19:55,527 --> 01:19:56,676
Yes, they are resting.

762
01:19:57,327 --> 01:19:59,158
You get back in the job.

763
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,443
I'm always the one you pick on.
- You're feeling hurt!

764
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:07,841
That's because you're so clever.

765
01:20:09,087 --> 01:20:10,805
For all the kind words
that you say...

766
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:12,960
...when my back is turned up.

767
01:20:18,727 --> 01:20:20,957
What the hell do you think
your getting paid for?

768
01:20:21,887 --> 01:20:25,880
Are you so stupid to think
you are on a paid vacation?

769
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:29,727
Get out to work right now!

770
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:31,764
You lousy bastard.

771
01:20:37,927 --> 01:20:38,916
All right.

772
01:20:39,887 --> 01:20:42,082
You can turn into the authorities.

773
01:20:42,447 --> 01:20:44,039
And you won't get a single crown more

774
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,799
Not a crown, Erik.

775
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:47,961
You're all done.

776
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:53,996
Lasse! They're coming.

777
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:15,522
Good Lord.

778
01:22:16,047 --> 01:22:17,446
They're going to do it.

779
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,402
Put him in the cellar.

780
01:23:46,887 --> 01:23:49,355
You heard me, put him in the cellar!

781
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:02,285
The rest of you go back to work.

782
01:25:08,687 --> 01:25:10,166
Come inside and get warm.

783
01:25:10,327 --> 01:25:12,363
Thank you, it's a strong wind.

784
01:25:22,207 --> 01:25:23,526
Then mama died.

785
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:27,164
And now she's in the cemetery
back home, in Tommelilla.

786
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:29,919
So your father is a widower?

787
01:25:35,087 --> 01:25:36,486
That's the word.

788
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:42,403
The sea is hard. My husband
went to sea a year ago.

789
01:25:42,727 --> 01:25:44,399
I've been like a widow since.

790
01:25:48,567 --> 01:25:50,125
Has he drowned?

791
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,320
I can't say. I haven't
received an omen.

792
01:26:07,247 --> 01:26:09,636
It's been a year that
she's living all alone?

793
01:26:10,727 --> 01:26:12,046
That's what she said.

794
01:26:13,647 --> 01:26:15,478
That's a long time.

795
01:26:17,287 --> 01:26:18,606
A long time.

796
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,878
And you told her that your
mother was dead?

797
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,759
Yes, of course you did.

798
01:26:45,127 --> 01:26:47,960
This is all we have left
of your mother.

799
01:26:51,367 --> 01:26:53,244
It's all or nothing now.

800
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:55,957
Pelle, could you...

801
01:26:56,487 --> 01:26:58,284
...visit Mrs. Olson tomorrow
after school...

802
01:26:58,447 --> 01:26:59,880
...and you can say I send...

803
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:01,037
...my...

804
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:04,605
...my thanks for taking you in
and treating you so well?

805
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:14,199
I got an omen last night.

806
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:17,961
In fact you could call
it a kind of vision.

807
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:22,118
I dreamt there was a huge
dog standing next to my bed.

808
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,123
His coat was dripping wet.

809
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:29,241
I knew it was the shipdog with
a message for me.

810
01:27:30,367 --> 01:27:31,641
I got out of bed.

811
01:27:32,087 --> 01:27:35,397
And outside my window
I saw a ship go down.

812
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:39,357
I saw my husband rise to heaven.

813
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:43,638
He was dripping wet with saltwater.

814
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:47,199
I realized immediately...

815
01:27:48,447 --> 01:27:50,438
...that the dog was
an omen from him.

816
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:24,362
Who's there?

817
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:27,167
Pelle's father. Lasse Karlsson.

818
01:28:58,247 --> 01:28:59,726
You're Pelle's father?

819
01:29:02,007 --> 01:29:03,679
He's very young your son.

820
01:29:06,127 --> 01:29:07,765
Come, sit.

821
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:16,762
Pelle, was...

822
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:18,766
...a late-comer you might say.

823
01:29:23,487 --> 01:29:25,921
But I can still do a man's work.

824
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,555
In every way.

825
01:29:28,687 --> 01:29:29,881
Drink.

826
01:29:41,887 --> 01:29:44,355
Thanks for the drink.
I must be on my way.

827
01:29:44,607 --> 01:29:45,676
Eat.

828
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:47,682
Eat.

829
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:50,602
That's how you get to know
something about a man.

830
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:53,681
You've walked a long way.

831
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:57,046
I just came by to thank
you for being kind to Pelle.

832
01:29:57,207 --> 01:29:59,721
No, that's enough talk. Go ahead.

833
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:01,516
Please.

834
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:07,196
You must have been a
good wife to your husband.

835
01:30:07,447 --> 01:30:08,641
Yes.

836
01:30:08,927 --> 01:30:10,076
That's true enough.

837
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:14,040
Everything and anything he desired
when he was on dry land.

838
01:30:15,527 --> 01:30:16,846
But he was ungrateful.

839
01:30:17,087 --> 01:30:18,645
He became tired of that.

840
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:23,325
I don't think my wife would'nt
spoke on that way of me.

841
01:30:24,287 --> 01:30:27,438
There is a lot to do in a house like
this, if there is a man to help.

842
01:30:27,607 --> 01:30:28,835
Yes, yes.

843
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:31,765
There is only one cow.

844
01:30:33,287 --> 01:30:34,845
That one could become two.

845
01:30:37,367 --> 01:30:40,120
I'm only a poor person...

846
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:44,358
...but we have decent
clothes, both of us.

847
01:30:45,967 --> 01:30:47,878
And I've a good pair of hands.

848
01:30:49,847 --> 01:30:52,122
And you're not be afraid
to use them. Would you?

849
01:30:52,287 --> 01:30:53,481
Not in the list.

850
01:30:56,607 --> 01:30:58,086
I'm not afraid of...

851
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:03,084
...hot coffee in bed on
sunday morning either.

852
01:31:10,327 --> 01:31:12,045
Can I think I should have a kiss?

853
01:31:15,287 --> 01:31:17,642
Yes, you should.

854
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,281
We look for happiness and
blessings on the three of us.

855
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:38,365
You already like the boy.

856
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:48,156
You'd better stay for the night.

857
01:31:55,287 --> 01:31:58,085
But I must be back
before the cows wake up.

858
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,878
And Pelle's all alone.

859
01:32:19,527 --> 01:32:22,280
Pelle. ¿ What are you doing here?

860
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:26,005
Come on. Come on.

861
01:32:30,167 --> 01:32:32,078
Everything is arranged.

862
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:35,241
We'll have a home and a woman
who'll take care of us.

863
01:32:35,647 --> 01:32:38,286
Missus Olson. You'll be happy.

864
01:32:40,767 --> 01:32:44,043
And may be we'll get coffee
in bed on sunday mornings.

865
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:49,958
Come, come.

866
01:32:58,527 --> 01:33:02,486
Give us this day...
- Do you have the biblical stories?

867
01:33:04,607 --> 01:33:06,916
And God...
- Does it have the one about the man...

868
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:09,601
...whose sons pulled down his pants?

869
01:33:09,967 --> 01:33:11,036
Noah?

870
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:14,160
Yes, old man Noah.

871
01:33:15,567 --> 01:33:18,001
What did he drink, old man Noah?
- Wine.

872
01:33:18,327 --> 01:33:21,444
Wine! Then he must
have been a rich man.

873
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:24,720
Then there was the one...

874
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:28,527
...the man who was so devilish clever.
- Which was his name?

875
01:33:28,687 --> 01:33:30,518
Laban.
- Laban!

876
01:33:30,687 --> 01:33:32,643
Laban, of course.

877
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,843
It was Laban, Laban.

878
01:33:35,847 --> 01:33:36,962
How is it go?

879
01:33:37,567 --> 01:33:39,876
Could you have two wives then?

880
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:41,844
All right, I won't bother
you any more.

881
01:33:45,207 --> 01:33:47,482
The great prophets. Let me see.

882
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:48,841
Let's see.

883
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:53,006
Isaiah and Daniel.

884
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:54,521
I remember them.

885
01:33:54,887 --> 01:33:58,118
I remember, if you want to you can
test me about the prophets.

886
01:33:59,487 --> 01:34:00,397
Let's hear them.

887
01:34:00,567 --> 01:34:03,445
You better stop reading now.
Otherwise you may lose track.

888
01:34:03,607 --> 01:34:05,563
There are only four great once.

889
01:34:11,407 --> 01:34:12,681
Isaiah.

890
01:34:13,007 --> 01:34:14,122
Come on, papa.

891
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:16,838
Well, first I need to concentrate.

892
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:19,364
There's Isaiah and Daniel...

893
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:22,440
I had them a minute ago,
where they have gone?

894
01:34:22,727 --> 01:34:24,479
There's Isaiah...

895
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:26,526
...Daniel...

896
01:34:30,887 --> 01:34:33,117
It's not working today, Pelle.

897
01:34:33,287 --> 01:34:34,879
Isaiah...
- Think of how old I am.

898
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:36,924
Daniel...

899
01:34:37,127 --> 01:34:39,800
Isaiah..., Daniel...

900
01:34:40,727 --> 01:34:42,206
Jesus.

901
01:34:42,447 --> 01:34:44,881
Not Jesus! Of course not, not him.

902
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,920
Isaiah, Daniel...
- They sure had devilish names.

903
01:34:48,087 --> 01:34:50,840
You got tongued-tied.
- Try papa.

904
01:34:53,367 --> 01:34:55,244
Isaiah.
- Isaiah.

905
01:34:55,407 --> 01:34:56,965
Daniel.
- Daniel.

906
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:58,960
Ezequiel.
- Ezequiel.

907
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:03,120
And Jeremiah!
- Jeremiah!

908
01:35:02,927 --> 01:35:06,806
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

909
01:35:07,007 --> 01:35:08,326
And Jeremiah.
- And Jeremiah.

910
01:35:08,647 --> 01:35:12,003
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

911
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:13,566
And Jeremiah.
- And Jeremiah.

912
01:35:13,807 --> 01:35:17,117
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...
- Isaiah, Daniel, Ezequiel...

913
01:35:17,287 --> 01:35:18,640
And Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah.

914
01:36:22,887 --> 01:36:24,320
Will you never grow up?

915
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:55,846
Don't be afraid.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

916
01:37:05,567 --> 01:37:07,478
Are you going to the barber's then?

917
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:09,565
That's the last thing I'd do.

918
01:37:44,607 --> 01:37:46,359
Erik are you coming?

919
01:37:49,367 --> 01:37:51,039
Are you coming to the fair, Erik?

920
01:37:54,887 --> 01:37:55,922
Come, Erik.

921
01:37:58,327 --> 01:37:59,476
Come on.

922
01:38:02,807 --> 01:38:04,763
Come on, Erik.

923
01:38:07,927 --> 01:38:09,440
Isn't Erik coming?

924
01:38:12,567 --> 01:38:15,127
He can't stay alone here
without the foreman.

925
01:38:15,287 --> 01:38:16,606
He doesn't want to go.

926
01:38:17,927 --> 01:38:21,317
Can't you go inside and get him?
You're the only one he listens to.

927
01:38:26,887 --> 01:38:27,683
Come on, Erik!

928
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:29,721
Let's go.

929
01:38:31,247 --> 01:38:32,760
We're going to the fair.

930
01:39:10,807 --> 01:39:14,641
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah.

931
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:18,596
Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Jeremiah!

932
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:23,763
Those were the days.
Imagine, two wives.

933
01:39:24,207 --> 01:39:27,995
One could make coffee and
the other could mend and sew.

934
01:39:56,447 --> 01:39:58,324
Everything's for sale!

935
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:01,203
You can take four packages!

936
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:07,522
Pelle.

937
01:40:18,567 --> 01:40:19,477
Hello.

938
01:43:18,207 --> 01:43:19,606
What's going on here?

939
01:43:23,887 --> 01:43:25,320
I'm leaving, aunt.

940
01:43:27,327 --> 01:43:28,237
I need to go.

941
01:43:29,567 --> 01:43:32,035
But Signe, is there a problem?

942
01:43:32,207 --> 01:43:34,562
If so, I'm sure we can solve it.

943
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:36,965
It's the isolation from
all my friends.

944
01:43:39,087 --> 01:43:41,521
I'm a city girl so...

945
01:43:42,207 --> 01:43:44,118
...so I'm returning.
- But you...

946
01:43:44,287 --> 01:43:46,357
...say nothing, Signe.
- I...

947
01:43:46,607 --> 01:43:49,326
...I know that I must told you before
- I'm so disappointed.

948
01:43:49,527 --> 01:43:50,846
I don't understand.

949
01:43:51,847 --> 01:43:53,678
It's just time to leave
to Copenhagen.

950
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:56,006
But I thought...

951
01:43:57,047 --> 01:43:59,561
...Kongstrup and I were sure
you were happy here.

952
01:44:03,127 --> 01:44:04,446
Dear Signe.

953
01:44:05,967 --> 01:44:09,801
I don't know what else to say.
I've made my decision.

954
01:44:11,247 --> 01:44:12,646
So suddenly...

955
01:44:13,287 --> 01:44:15,881
If you had mentioned it before
I could understand.

956
01:44:17,207 --> 01:44:19,675
Sorry.
- Why didn't you...?

957
01:44:21,567 --> 01:44:24,604
Is your reason why you don't look at
the eyes. Should I know something?

958
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:25,962
Signe?

959
01:44:30,247 --> 01:44:31,646
How are you going to manage?

960
01:44:32,127 --> 01:44:34,960
Well, you see...
- Who buy you a ticket?

961
01:44:35,687 --> 01:44:39,441
Kongstrup takes me to the boat.

962
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:41,962
Thank God. I don't have to worry.

963
01:44:42,327 --> 01:44:43,999
If only I could understand...

964
01:44:44,647 --> 01:44:46,638
You will return here for a visit?

965
01:44:48,047 --> 01:44:51,596
I'd hope you would take over
around the farm at an old age.

966
01:44:51,767 --> 01:44:53,325
Kongstrup too wanted it.

967
01:44:53,767 --> 01:44:56,600
Signe, dearest, don't cry!

968
01:44:56,927 --> 01:44:59,236
It's not as serious as all that.

969
01:44:59,687 --> 01:45:01,484
I want you to feel free...

970
01:45:01,847 --> 01:45:04,998
...to visit us the times
that you want.

971
01:45:25,487 --> 01:45:26,602
Kongstrup!

972
01:45:28,567 --> 01:45:29,966
Kongstrup!

973
01:45:32,727 --> 01:45:35,036
Come out and talk to me!

974
01:45:37,207 --> 01:45:39,482
I'm here to collect
the money, Kongstrup!

975
01:45:40,527 --> 01:45:41,562
Kongstrup!

976
01:46:00,607 --> 01:46:01,960
Look who it is!

977
01:46:04,327 --> 01:46:05,806
Let me say hello to you.

978
01:46:08,207 --> 01:46:10,641
Are you too proud to
say hello to me?

979
01:46:11,887 --> 01:46:13,286
Do you think that you're better?

980
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:17,037
Is it because you're leaving
to have your bastard son...

981
01:46:17,207 --> 01:46:20,040
...on the other side of the sea,
while I had mine in a turnip patch?

982
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:22,243
But it was the same
old whoremonger.

983
01:46:22,447 --> 01:46:24,244
The same whoremonger as ever!

984
01:46:26,567 --> 01:46:28,637
Signe, Signe.

985
01:46:29,047 --> 01:46:30,196
Signe.

986
01:46:30,367 --> 01:46:32,483
Would you tell him that
I need the money?

987
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:34,365
Why do you leave evil eye?

988
01:46:34,527 --> 01:46:36,563
I warned you!

989
01:46:36,727 --> 01:46:38,718
Let me go! Let me go!

990
01:46:38,887 --> 01:46:42,516
Kongstrup, come on and help
you're old sweetheart!

991
01:46:43,007 --> 01:46:44,076
Let me go!

992
01:46:44,247 --> 01:46:45,202
Let me go!

993
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:47,323
Let me go!

994
01:47:51,847 --> 01:47:53,519
What do you stare?

995
01:48:08,847 --> 01:48:11,725
If I've to search for you once more...
- Sorry madame.

996
01:48:28,847 --> 01:48:30,326
It beats me.

997
01:48:30,967 --> 01:48:34,323
I would have thought that only
dead could end such grief.

998
01:48:35,247 --> 01:48:37,283
She must have an iron grip on herself

999
01:49:50,327 --> 01:49:52,045
Wake up! Send the doctor, quick!

1000
01:49:55,687 --> 01:49:56,802
What is it papa?

1001
01:49:57,447 --> 01:50:00,280
Dear Jesus! It must be something bad.

1002
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:10,282
What is it?
- It's so awful.

1003
01:50:10,447 --> 01:50:11,243
What is it?

1004
01:50:12,567 --> 01:50:14,319
What? What did you say?

1005
01:50:14,487 --> 01:50:16,318
She cut...!
- What is it?

1006
01:50:18,327 --> 01:50:19,282
What happened?
- Kongstrup.

1007
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:21,005
What?
- He's bleeding.

1008
01:50:21,167 --> 01:50:23,078
We should get some help.
- Really?

1009
01:51:06,607 --> 01:51:07,562
It's fun!

1010
01:51:48,127 --> 01:51:50,721
Mister Freeze, could you
tell us what this means?

1011
01:51:50,887 --> 01:51:54,641
Pelle is the young cuckoo
in missus Olson's nest.

1012
01:51:56,847 --> 01:51:58,838
Ins't she married to a seaman?

1013
01:51:59,007 --> 01:52:00,486
He's captain Olson's bride.

1014
01:52:00,647 --> 01:52:02,717
Your father doesn't care
about that, does he?

1015
01:52:02,967 --> 01:52:05,083
He's captain Olson's bride.

1016
01:52:05,247 --> 01:52:07,886
Your father doesn't care
about that, does he?

1017
01:52:08,047 --> 01:52:09,765
Watch out! Watch out!

1018
01:52:09,927 --> 01:52:12,316
Any girl would like to marry
a man like that.

1019
01:52:12,487 --> 01:52:14,478
What if her husband
comes back, Pelle?

1020
01:52:31,567 --> 01:52:33,319
Guess what Pelle?

1021
01:52:33,487 --> 01:52:35,079
This is for Captain Olson!

1022
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:48,800
Just you wait Pelle,
we're gonna get you.

1023
01:53:19,927 --> 01:53:21,076
Pelle.

1024
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:25,521
I've thinking a lot
about the situation.

1025
01:53:28,487 --> 01:53:31,399
You and I would be welcome
at missus Olson's.

1026
01:53:34,967 --> 01:53:36,605
We could move right in.

1027
01:53:43,727 --> 01:53:45,126
I mean...

1028
01:53:45,607 --> 01:53:49,395
It's against the law to
move in with a woman who's married.

1029
01:53:50,527 --> 01:53:52,802
But...

1030
01:53:53,767 --> 01:53:56,964
I want some comfort.

1031
01:53:59,807 --> 01:54:02,685
We could make it look like
the two of us are labourers.

1032
01:54:06,447 --> 01:54:09,245
She could sew you new clothes.

1033
01:54:09,647 --> 01:54:11,478
Wouldn't it be nice to
have new underwear?

1034
01:54:14,327 --> 01:54:15,555
lf...

1035
01:54:16,047 --> 01:54:17,878
...I did move in with missus Olson...

1036
01:54:18,527 --> 01:54:20,518
...you did move in with missus Olson?

1037
01:54:24,287 --> 01:54:26,926
It's a lot easier for you.
Is all ahead of you.

1038
01:54:27,127 --> 01:54:29,322
Your whole future to make
something happen.

1039
01:54:29,567 --> 01:54:31,205
I need someone to take care of me.

1040
01:54:32,127 --> 01:54:34,243
I'll run away if you move in.

1041
01:54:35,767 --> 01:54:38,281
You have to grow
old to say that to me.

1042
01:54:38,487 --> 01:54:39,761
Just look what you're doing?

1043
01:54:39,927 --> 01:54:41,406
Someone else will have
to fill in the holes.

1044
01:54:41,567 --> 01:54:44,081
So the foreman doesn't find you out.

1045
01:54:44,287 --> 01:54:45,879
Stop that right now.

1046
01:54:46,127 --> 01:54:49,244
I don't make acarving of you
and missus Olson in bed.

1047
01:54:49,407 --> 01:54:51,318
You're getting a little so far.
Come back here!

1048
01:54:51,607 --> 01:54:55,566
You'd better watch out I don't
send the foreman on you.

1049
01:55:06,007 --> 01:55:06,917
Pelle!

1050
01:55:08,847 --> 01:55:09,723
Pelle!

1051
01:55:11,127 --> 01:55:12,196
Pelle!

1052
01:55:14,607 --> 01:55:15,960
Could you go by missus Olson's...

1053
01:55:16,127 --> 01:55:18,083
...on your way back from school?

1054
01:55:20,007 --> 01:55:22,316
This is something she's
going to mend for us.

1055
01:55:24,327 --> 01:55:27,000
And be sure to tell her
I'll come by this evening.

1056
01:55:27,487 --> 01:55:30,160
Why don't you marry her, papa?

1057
01:55:30,847 --> 01:55:33,077
Pelle, I will.

1058
01:55:33,967 --> 01:55:36,401
But we've got to deal with
the country's authorities.

1059
01:55:37,847 --> 01:55:40,600
Missus Olson needs a dead
certificate from the government.

1060
01:55:41,927 --> 01:55:44,487
But soon we'll have coffee and bed.

1061
01:56:02,887 --> 01:56:06,118
It's missus Olson's young cuckoo!

1062
01:56:28,767 --> 01:56:30,917
Let's see how tough you are, Pelle.

1063
01:56:32,447 --> 01:56:33,846
To the sea with him!

1064
01:56:34,287 --> 01:56:35,845
Run cuckoo bird!
- Run!

1065
01:56:56,607 --> 01:56:58,563
Come on, let's see you dance!

1066
01:56:58,727 --> 01:57:01,366
Run cuckoo bird!

1067
01:57:07,527 --> 01:57:09,802
Come back to Sweden!

1068
01:57:09,967 --> 01:57:11,366
Go away, cuckoo bird!

1069
01:57:11,527 --> 01:57:13,483
Away, away, away, away!

1070
01:57:14,967 --> 01:57:17,606
Away, away, away!

1071
01:57:18,327 --> 01:57:21,956
Away, away, away. Come on!

1072
01:58:44,247 --> 01:58:45,885
Look! It's Captain Olson!

1073
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:15,402
You're at home already.

1074
01:59:21,687 --> 01:59:24,076
Missus's Olson husband
has come home.

1075
02:00:36,767 --> 02:00:40,203
I will stay here forever...

1076
02:00:40,727 --> 02:00:42,638
...standing here like...

1077
02:00:43,367 --> 02:00:45,403
...a block of hay in the shed.

1078
02:00:46,487 --> 02:00:48,398
I was only looking for a home...

1079
02:00:49,167 --> 02:00:51,123
...to spend my old age.

1080
02:00:52,127 --> 02:00:55,403
I've found someone and I felt free.

1081
02:00:57,167 --> 02:00:58,486
Jesus!

1082
02:01:00,407 --> 02:01:02,045
Jesus, help!

1083
02:02:18,047 --> 02:02:20,436
What the hell is the point of crying?

1084
02:02:22,767 --> 02:02:24,883
I want you to meet my new sweetheart.

1085
02:02:27,247 --> 02:02:28,965
Here, Pelle.

1086
02:02:35,487 --> 02:02:36,966
I forgot...

1087
02:02:38,207 --> 02:02:40,926
...that you didn't this thing.
You're too fine.

1088
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:44,003
It doesn't help going around...

1089
02:02:44,167 --> 02:02:45,998
...whimpering.

1090
02:02:52,007 --> 02:02:52,996
Papa!

1091
02:02:55,967 --> 02:02:57,878
It's sleepery.

1092
02:03:02,127 --> 02:03:04,197
This is a little devil.

1093
02:03:10,247 --> 02:03:11,680
You're crying?

1094
02:03:14,527 --> 02:03:16,438
If some do something to you...

1095
02:03:17,407 --> 02:03:21,400
...tell them that your father is
Lasse, from Tommelilla.

1096
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:24,560
It's alright, your father is here.

1097
02:03:24,967 --> 02:03:28,323
And your father can stand
on his own two feet.

1098
02:03:32,807 --> 02:03:35,196
I'm going out to the big house.

1099
02:03:36,887 --> 02:03:38,718
Now the bastard is gonna...

1100
02:03:38,887 --> 02:03:40,878
...have to answer for all these years

1101
02:03:41,607 --> 02:03:43,916
We are going to have a
little talk with the missus.

1102
02:03:44,127 --> 02:03:45,685
I won't let you go out there!

1103
02:04:27,127 --> 02:04:28,276
Erik.

1104
02:04:30,127 --> 02:04:31,003
Erik.

1105
02:04:33,567 --> 02:04:34,443
Erik.

1106
02:04:36,807 --> 02:04:39,002
Spring is coming, that's
what papa says.

1107
02:04:40,807 --> 02:04:42,479
In the spring you'll be...

1108
02:04:43,527 --> 02:04:44,482
...a free man.

1109
02:04:46,447 --> 02:04:47,402
Think of it.

1110
02:04:49,687 --> 02:04:51,723
Then, we can leave this awful place.

1111
02:04:53,927 --> 02:04:55,724
And go out and conquer the world.

1112
02:05:19,727 --> 02:05:21,080
Pelle.

1113
02:05:23,167 --> 02:05:24,839
What is it they all talk about?

1114
02:05:25,447 --> 02:05:26,926
I wouldn't know.

1115
02:05:27,967 --> 02:05:29,559
You haven't heard anything?

1116
02:05:30,487 --> 02:05:33,957
Do you think I wanna go to class
so they can laugh at me some more?

1117
02:05:50,007 --> 02:05:52,726
I know I drink too much.

1118
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:57,403
But it's difficult not to, when
you're heart is broken.

1119
02:06:02,967 --> 02:06:03,843
Pelle...

1120
02:06:05,287 --> 02:06:09,121
...if I promise you'll never again se
me the way I was yesterday...

1121
02:06:09,847 --> 02:06:11,758
...would you agree to go to school?

1122
02:06:11,927 --> 02:06:13,121
Tomorrow, Pelle?

1123
02:06:14,047 --> 02:06:15,321
Because if you don't...

1124
02:06:17,447 --> 02:06:18,675
...then they will force you.

1125
02:06:19,007 --> 02:06:21,396
There'll be a lot of trouble
with the authority.

1126
02:06:24,807 --> 02:06:26,877
Alright? Say yes.

1127
02:06:29,647 --> 02:06:32,286
10 times 10 is a hundred

1128
02:06:32,687 --> 02:06:36,077
100 times 10 is a thousand.

1129
02:06:36,247 --> 02:06:39,125
100 divided by 10 is 10.

1130
02:06:39,287 --> 02:06:42,120
1000 divided by 10 is 100.

1131
02:06:51,087 --> 02:06:52,281
Mister Freeze?

1132
02:06:52,567 --> 02:06:53,716
Mister Freeze.

1133
02:06:54,607 --> 02:06:55,722
He's asleep.

1134
02:06:56,007 --> 02:06:57,725
Mister Freeze, it's time.

1135
02:07:07,327 --> 02:07:08,282
Sir.

1136
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:11,124
It's time to go home.

1137
02:08:14,487 --> 02:08:16,284
Pelle, where's your father?

1138
02:08:19,767 --> 02:08:20,961
Fooling around?

1139
02:08:23,687 --> 02:08:25,405
My father would be happy...

1140
02:08:25,567 --> 02:08:28,240
...to marry your father to captain
Olson's second wife.

1141
02:08:35,647 --> 02:08:37,558
Help papa! Help!

1142
02:08:41,727 --> 02:08:44,924
You scoundrel!
How dare you hit my son!

1143
02:08:45,887 --> 02:08:48,447
You're going to hear from
the authorities about this!

1144
02:08:54,487 --> 02:08:55,636
Pelle, Pelle, Pelle...

1145
02:08:55,807 --> 02:08:58,924
That was about the worst you
could do, hit the minister's son.

1146
02:08:59,807 --> 02:09:01,843
The town's minister.

1147
02:09:02,167 --> 02:09:04,317
He deserved it, I'm sure.

1148
02:09:04,487 --> 02:09:07,160
But still you shouldn't have done it.
What else did he do to you?

1149
02:09:07,647 --> 02:09:10,878
He said he could get you married
at boatsman Olson's second wife.

1150
02:09:12,167 --> 02:09:13,282
He did?

1151
02:09:15,047 --> 02:09:16,162
He did?

1152
02:09:17,287 --> 02:09:21,246
If I had him here,
I'd rip his innards out.

1153
02:09:21,647 --> 02:09:22,682
Do you feel revenged?

1154
02:09:22,887 --> 02:09:23,922
No, not really.

1155
02:09:24,647 --> 02:09:28,003
His father came and gave
what he deserved.

1156
02:09:28,167 --> 02:09:29,236
Revenge.

1157
02:09:30,687 --> 02:09:33,076
It's a bad situation.

1158
02:09:35,127 --> 02:09:37,277
And you don't intend to apologize?

1159
02:09:38,367 --> 02:09:40,085
No, no, you shouldn't.

1160
02:09:43,447 --> 02:09:46,564
Although maybe you should...
No, no.

1161
02:09:47,327 --> 02:09:48,806
You have to twist and turn...

1162
02:09:49,647 --> 02:09:51,285
...as the eel said in the frying pan.

1163
02:09:56,127 --> 02:09:58,482
We are very sorry to bother you...

1164
02:09:58,647 --> 02:10:01,207
We have no choice, but...

1165
02:10:01,607 --> 02:10:03,199
...to ask for your help.

1166
02:10:04,247 --> 02:10:06,044
Did you blow your nose properly?

1167
02:10:07,887 --> 02:10:10,003
We are very sorry to bother you, Sir.

1168
02:10:10,527 --> 02:10:11,721
I'm very sorry.

1169
02:10:18,767 --> 02:10:20,758
There's probably no one home.
- Let's go in.

1170
02:10:21,087 --> 02:10:22,725
We can't stand here all day.

1171
02:10:22,887 --> 02:10:25,879
Go first, if you think you
can handle this better.

1172
02:10:27,367 --> 02:10:28,595
Come in.

1173
02:10:30,327 --> 02:10:31,760
Good day.

1174
02:10:32,167 --> 02:10:33,566
Good day.

1175
02:10:35,687 --> 02:10:37,518
It's like this...

1176
02:10:39,647 --> 02:10:42,878
I hope the proprietor
be angry with us.

1177
02:10:44,847 --> 02:10:46,360
He won't be angry.

1178
02:10:51,247 --> 02:10:53,124
You must forgive us for coming here...

1179
02:10:53,287 --> 02:10:55,676
...to talk about something which
has nothing to do with the farm.

1180
02:10:56,407 --> 02:10:57,635
But...

1181
02:10:59,927 --> 02:11:01,883
...when the father's sins...

1182
02:11:02,567 --> 02:11:04,398
...are visited upon his son.

1183
02:11:05,447 --> 02:11:06,766
Then...

1184
02:11:06,927 --> 02:11:08,758
Then...
- Why are you standing?

1185
02:11:09,687 --> 02:11:10,756
Sit down, please.

1186
02:11:10,927 --> 02:11:12,679
Thank you.
- Why you haven't...

1187
02:11:12,847 --> 02:11:14,041
...offered them a sit, dear?

1188
02:11:22,687 --> 02:11:24,598
Thank you.
- What is it?

1189
02:11:25,607 --> 02:11:26,596
You need money?

1190
02:11:27,127 --> 02:11:28,924
No, it's...

1191
02:11:29,447 --> 02:11:30,880
Is just like a...

1192
02:11:31,527 --> 02:11:33,245
It's just that...

1193
02:11:36,927 --> 02:11:39,077
I hope that you won't be angry but...

1194
02:11:40,647 --> 02:11:42,046
...it's...

1195
02:11:42,927 --> 02:11:44,201
It's the boy.

1196
02:11:45,087 --> 02:11:46,805
They're going to send him away.

1197
02:11:47,447 --> 02:11:48,721
Send him away?
- Yes.

1198
02:11:48,927 --> 02:11:50,076
¿ What have you done?

1199
02:11:56,767 --> 02:11:58,564
I beat up the minister's son.

1200
02:11:59,887 --> 02:12:01,081
And why you did you do that?

1201
02:12:05,207 --> 02:12:07,437
Because he said evil
things about Lasse.

1202
02:12:08,967 --> 02:12:10,036
What did he say?

1203
02:12:11,367 --> 02:12:14,325
He called me...

1204
02:12:16,167 --> 02:12:18,920
He called me Mrs. Olson's plaything.

1205
02:12:19,527 --> 02:12:21,836
You know, the kids...

1206
02:12:27,527 --> 02:12:28,721
I was...

1207
02:12:29,807 --> 02:12:31,479
...Mrs. Olson's sweetheart.

1208
02:12:31,647 --> 02:12:33,842
Because everyone thought
she was a widow.

1209
02:12:36,367 --> 02:12:39,484
And other day her husband
came home from the sea.

1210
02:12:42,647 --> 02:12:43,762
Here.

1211
02:12:46,167 --> 02:12:49,398
And the boy made Pelle furious.
- Yes, unfortunately.

1212
02:12:50,327 --> 02:12:51,476
That's how it is.

1213
02:12:51,647 --> 02:12:52,477
With poor wretches...

1214
02:12:52,647 --> 02:12:54,717
...they're only there to be pecked at

1215
02:12:54,887 --> 02:12:57,447
Well, I prefer the bird that pecks
back and defends his nest...

1216
02:12:57,647 --> 02:12:59,444
...regardless of the poor it is.

1217
02:13:01,087 --> 02:13:04,716
I'll do what I can.
Don't worry about it anymore.

1218
02:13:04,967 --> 02:13:05,922
Thank you.

1219
02:13:08,127 --> 02:13:09,116
By the way.

1220
02:13:09,847 --> 02:13:12,042
My husband and I decided...

1221
02:13:12,287 --> 02:13:16,280
...the young assistant to
our foreman will be leaving.

1222
02:13:16,847 --> 02:13:20,601
Maybe Pelle would like to
become his replacement.

1223
02:13:25,247 --> 02:13:26,646
Thank you.

1224
02:13:26,927 --> 02:13:28,645
Say thank you.

1225
02:13:42,287 --> 02:13:45,757
Almost as if she thought
it was her own idea?

1226
02:13:46,047 --> 02:13:47,844
She thought, she thought it herself.

1227
02:13:49,967 --> 02:13:51,195
Your recognized this?

1228
02:13:51,847 --> 02:13:54,077
They're a bit big, but
we'll stuff them with papers.

1229
02:13:54,247 --> 02:13:55,600
Try them on.

1230
02:14:00,967 --> 02:14:03,322
I'll get some boot wax,
and they'll be like new.

1231
02:14:04,487 --> 02:14:06,159
Now let's have a look.

1232
02:14:10,927 --> 02:14:14,476
Stand up straight. I want
you stand very straight.

1233
02:14:14,687 --> 02:14:17,440
Shoulders back and
chin a little forward.

1234
02:14:17,607 --> 02:14:19,757
Not like that. Lift you chin a little

1235
02:14:19,927 --> 02:14:22,282
Now a sharp look in the eye.

1236
02:14:22,927 --> 02:14:24,997
You must command respect for yourself

1237
02:14:26,207 --> 02:14:28,675
The way you stand and the look
in your eye. That's what does it.

1238
02:14:32,327 --> 02:14:35,239
Let the others labour.
You give the orders.

1239
02:14:36,247 --> 02:14:37,600
You can't take tonight off!

1240
02:14:37,767 --> 02:14:39,280
Clean now the cow down!

1241
02:14:41,247 --> 02:14:42,282
And Pelle...

1242
02:14:43,447 --> 02:14:45,358
Maybe you'll get to eat
sunday dinner with the proprietor.

1243
02:14:45,527 --> 02:14:48,758
And have a napkin-ring
with your name on it.

1244
02:14:49,247 --> 02:14:50,566
Pelle Karlsson.

1245
02:15:02,727 --> 02:15:06,322
And who knows, Pelle. Maybe
one day you'll be the foreman.

1246
02:15:06,687 --> 02:15:10,475
I could tell you the way she
was thinking it was perfect.

1247
02:15:36,767 --> 02:15:38,041
Erik!

1248
02:15:42,447 --> 02:15:43,721
Erik!

1249
02:15:47,007 --> 02:15:48,520
Erik!

1250
02:15:49,327 --> 02:15:50,726
Wait for me!

1251
02:15:53,567 --> 02:15:54,886
Erik!

1252
02:16:19,687 --> 02:16:21,086
I don't want it.

1253
02:16:25,767 --> 02:16:27,485
We must leave here, papa.

1254
02:16:28,007 --> 02:16:29,486
Now.

1255
02:16:59,727 --> 02:17:00,762
It's Karna.

1256
02:17:00,927 --> 02:17:02,246
I get here in time.

1257
02:17:02,927 --> 02:17:05,043
I was afraid the foreman
and the missus would see me.

1258
02:17:06,327 --> 02:17:07,840
A gift for you.

1259
02:17:08,447 --> 02:17:09,926
It's a down quilt.

1260
02:17:10,167 --> 02:17:13,398
It'll keep you warm. No matter
where you end up in the world.

1261
02:17:14,647 --> 02:17:15,875
Bye, Gabriela.

1262
02:17:19,847 --> 02:17:21,041
Bye, Blanca.

1263
02:17:21,567 --> 02:17:23,046
You'll be a good girl.

1264
02:17:32,687 --> 02:17:34,166
Well, Aspasia.

1265
02:17:34,767 --> 02:17:36,564
Time to say goodbye to Pelle.

1266
02:17:37,127 --> 02:17:39,197
He is going up to see the world.

1267
02:17:47,127 --> 02:17:48,355
Papa.

1268
02:17:54,647 --> 02:17:55,921
What is it?

1269
02:18:03,767 --> 02:18:05,200
Can't we stay?

1270
02:18:32,687 --> 02:18:34,405
You'll have to go
without me, Pelle.

1271
02:18:35,927 --> 02:18:37,883
I don't have the strength anymore.

1272
02:18:38,167 --> 02:18:40,158
I'm too old. It's the reason.

1273
02:18:41,727 --> 02:18:43,126
Too old.

1274
02:18:45,367 --> 02:18:47,005
There's no future for an old man.

1275
02:18:50,727 --> 02:18:51,955
Do you understand that?

1276
02:19:11,247 --> 02:19:13,158
I'll make a bundle for you.

1277
02:19:13,807 --> 02:19:16,799
You can have 2 of
my shirts then you have 4.

1278
02:19:17,967 --> 02:19:19,844
Then one you're wearing is clean.

1279
02:19:20,647 --> 02:19:23,207
And remember: never wear
it more than two weeks...

1280
02:19:23,367 --> 02:19:25,722
...at a time, otherwise you
get bad name in town.

1281
02:19:26,007 --> 02:19:28,521
And change your socks
before they wear out.

1282
02:19:28,687 --> 02:19:30,643
Keep your clothes clean.
Keep your good name.

1283
02:19:30,847 --> 02:19:33,566
You save half the work and all shames

1284
02:19:38,447 --> 02:19:40,483
You can have my boots too.

1285
02:19:43,007 --> 02:19:44,998
They are a bit worn.

1286
02:19:48,727 --> 02:19:50,319
And here's the Bible.

1287
02:19:54,567 --> 02:19:56,603
Your mohter said
I was to give it to you...

1288
02:19:57,007 --> 02:19:59,202
...on the day she went
out to the world.

1289
02:20:28,727 --> 02:20:32,322
Next time we'll meet maybe
there'll be a proper home for you.

1290
02:20:37,287 --> 02:20:39,005
Say Karna goodbye.

1291
02:20:48,327 --> 02:20:49,726
Goodbye, papa.

1292
02:20:51,967 --> 02:20:52,843
Thank you.
