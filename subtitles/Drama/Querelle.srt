1
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:36,099
<b><i>The thought of murder</i></b>
<b><i>often evokes thoughts... </i></b>

2
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:38,543
<b><i>of the sea and of sailors. </i></b>

3
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,741
<b><i>What naturally follows</i></b>
<b><i>thoughts of the sea and murder... </i></b>

4
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,977
<b><i>is the thought</i></b>
<b><i>of love or sexuality. </i></b>

5
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,320
<b>Hey! Closing time! </b>

6
00:00:56,397 --> 00:00:58,922
<b>Didn't you understand me, Robert? </b>
<b>It's closing time! </b>

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,160
<b>Then lock the door. </b>

8
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:02,930
<b>Robert is staying with me. </b>

9
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,404
<b>What did you say? </b>

10
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,965
<b>You heard me. </b>
<b>Robert is staying here with me tonight. </b>

11
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:10,567
<b>What do you think of that? </b>

12
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,374
<b>Of what? </b>

13
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,278
<b>After all, she's still your wife. </b>

14
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,613
<b>You think I should be jealous? </b>

15
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:19,778
<b>- It would be normal. </b>
<b>- Maybe, but what's normal? </b>

16
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:24,281
<b>We got a deal: </b>

17
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,088
<b>Lysiane does what she feels like... </b>

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,594
<b>and leaves me free</b>
<b>to do what I want, understand? </b>

19
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,426
<b>That's important for me. </b>

20
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,866
<b>- Chicago! </b>
<b>- Indeed. </b>

21
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,736
<b>Anyway, I want to read his cards. </b>
<b>Right, kiddo? </b>

22
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,706
<b>Hope you know</b>
<b>what you're doing. </b>

23
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:44,043
<b>You know</b>
<b>I know what I want. </b>

24
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,076
<b>You've lost, Mario. </b>

25
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:18,703
<b>Then let's have another drink. </b>

26
00:02:41,936 --> 00:02:43,699
<b>You have a brother? </b>

27
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,068
<b>So what? </b>

28
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:48,966
<b>You never mentioned him. </b>

29
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,102
<b>Why should I? </b>

30
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,313
<b>You're very much alike, </b>
<b>aren't you? </b>

31
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:59,776
<b>That's what other people say... </b>

32
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:01,822
<b>but it isn't true. </b>

33
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,481
<b>Querelle is a sailor. </b>

34
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,287
<b>Maybe it's true. </b>

35
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,161
<b>And you love one another... </b>

36
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,323
<b>more than you'd like to. </b>

37
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,423
<b>Bullshit. </b>

38
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,933
<b>We're brothers... </b>

39
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,299
<b>and that's all there is to it. </b>

40
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,970
<b>Why are you shaking your head? </b>

41
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:27,844
<b>I don't know why... </b>

42
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:31,578
<b>but your brother</b>
<b>is in great danger. </b>

43
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:34,644
<b>In danger? </b>
<b>What kind of danger? </b>

44
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,052
<b>In danger of... </b>

45
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:39,388
<b>finding himself. </b>

46
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,868
<b><i>It's difficult to</i></b>
<b><i>brush past those shoulders... </i></b>

47
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,374
<b><i>profiles, curls... </i></b>

48
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,343
<b><i>those strong and supple boys... </i></b>

49
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,209
<b><i>without imagining them</i></b>
<b><i>capable of murder. </i></b>

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,081
<b>Finally, land. </b>

51
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:05,983
<b>And broads! </b>

52
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:09,113
<b>Juicy cunts. Hot and wet. </b>

53
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,385
<b>- Have you been in Brest before? </b>
<b>- Why? </b>

54
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,258
<b>Because they've got the raunchiest</b>
<b>whorehouse in the world. </b>

55
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,689
<b>The Feria. </b>

56
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,734
<b>Right. That's the name of the place. </b>

57
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,531
<b>Any of you guys know it? </b>

58
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:25,731
<b>- Yeah, but only from what I've heard. </b>
<b>- And what have you heard? </b>

59
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,297
<b>Nothing specific. </b>

60
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,869
<b>They say every trick has</b>
<b>to throw dice with the boss... </b>

61
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:33,106
<b>if he wants to catch a hooker. </b>

62
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:37,348
<b>Nono. That's the name</b>
<b>of the Feria boss. </b>

63
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:40,314
<b>That's right. Nono. </b>

64
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,022
<b>Why do they have to throw dice? </b>

65
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,890
<b>That's the rule. </b>

66
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:49,896
<b>When you win, </b>
<b>you get to have your pick. </b>

67
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:53,491
<b>When you lose, you have to</b>
<b>let the boss fuck you first. </b>

68
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,427
<b>Really? </b>

69
00:04:55,503 --> 00:05:00,065
<b>Really, and I'm damn sure there's plenty</b>
<b>of guys who kinda like losing. </b>

70
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,404
<b>- If it turns them on. </b>
<b>- So what? </b>

71
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:10,677
<b><i>Once I have suffered the solitude</i></b>
<b><i>caused by my peculiarity long enough... </i></b>

72
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,618
<b><i>it may be that naked</i></b>
<b><i>I will hold these boys... </i></b>

73
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:17,954
<b><i>who shatter me with their</i></b>
<b><i>audacity and strength, against my body. </i></b>

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,155
<b><i>Though I hardly dare believe it. </i></b>

75
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:26,397
<b><i>With tears in my eyes, </i></b>
<b><i>I thank God for granting me this bliss. </i></b>

76
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:30,303
<b><i>My tears soften me. </i></b>

77
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:35,070
<b><i>I melt with their wetness</i></b>
<b><i>on my cheeks. I toss. </i></b>

78
00:05:35,142 --> 00:05:37,838
<b><i>I roll in waves</i></b>
<b><i>of tenderness for these boys... </i></b>

79
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,881
<b><i>and their hard, shallow cheeks. </i></b>

80
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,317
<b><i>Querelle's great passion</i></b>
<b><i>is his own body in repose. </i></b>

81
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,193
<b>It is as if he's reflecting</b>
<b>himself in his own image. </b>

82
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:01,325
<b>He's looking at himself</b>
<b>as if through a magnifying glass. </b>

83
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:10,876
<b>He's scrutinizing the minute events</b>
<b>like an etymologist. </b>

84
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:15,111
<b>But how shining is his body</b>
<b>in the glory of his proud movements? </b>

85
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,774
<b>Your boots, sir. </b>

86
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,509
<b>Leave them there. </b>

87
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,386
<b>Anything else, sir? </b>

88
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,047
<b>No, thank you. </b>

89
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:32,983
<b><i>Since they themselves</i></b>
<b><i>wished to deny it... </i></b>

90
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:35,825
<b><i>the strange resemblance</i></b>
<b><i>of the two brothers... </i></b>

91
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,888
<b><i>seemed attractive only to others. </i></b>

92
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:43,130
<b><i>They met only in the evenings, </i></b>
<b><i>as late as possible... </i></b>

93
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,365
<b><i>in the one bed of a room... </i></b>

94
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,704
<b><i>near the one in which</i></b>
<b><i>their mother had lived in poverty. </i></b>

95
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:56,581
<b><i>Perhaps they met again</i></b>
<b><i>in their love for their mother... </i></b>

96
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,550
<b><i>but at such a deep level... </i></b>

97
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,382
<b><i>that they could not see it at all. </i></b>

98
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,209
<b>How long have you been in Brest? </b>

99
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:26,738
<b>Since yesterday. </b>

100
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:28,679
<b>Never thought</b>
<b>I'd run into you here. </b>

101
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:32,116
<b>I'm the lover</b>

102
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:35,387

<b>for the last six months. </b>

103
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,457
<b>- What about her husband? </b>
<b>- He's got interests of his own. </b>

104
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,359
<b>Why did you come here? </b>

105
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,867
<b>Got a little business to take care of. </b>
<b>I'm looking for a customer. </b>

106
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:49,995
<b>- Opium? </b>
<b>- Yeah, that's right. </b>

107
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,006
<b>No sweat. </b>
<b>Nono's the contact you want. </b>

108
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,371
<b>I'll introduce you. </b>

109
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:58,508
<b>What about the cop with him? </b>

110
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,605
<b>He's part of the furniture. </b>
<b>He ain't a cop in here. </b>

111
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:03,309
<b>Just the opposite. </b>

112
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,810
<b>He's our safety guarantee. </b>

113
00:09:09,156 --> 00:09:11,556
<b>This is Querelle, my brother. </b>

114
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,525
<b>He has a deal for you. </b>

115
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,757

116

<b>What's the deal? </b>

119
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,613
<b>Opium. </b>

120
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,452
<b>Five k's. </b>

121
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:42,113
<b>Ten thousand dollars. </b>

122
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,380
<b>You got it. </b>

123
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,859
<b>Cash. </b>

124
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:48,659
<b>Of course. </b>

125
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,323
<b><i>Querelle was frozen by Mario's gaze. </i></b>

126
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,332
<b><i>More than indifferent... </i></b>

127
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,733
<b><i>Mario's gaze and stance</i></b>
<b><i>were glacial. </i></b>

128
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:08,071
<b><i>At the same time, Querelle was struck</i></b>
<b><i>by the owner's extraordinary strength... </i></b>

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,242
<b><i>and the cop's beauty. </i></b>

130
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:15,287
<b><i>Never before had he</i></b>
<b><i>experienced true rivalry... </i></b>

131
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:18,120
<b><i>with which he had faced</i></b>
<b><i>in these two. </i></b>

132
00:10:21,262 --> 00:10:24,129
<b>There's nothing fishy</b>
<b>about this, is there? </b>

133
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,928
<b>You don't have anything</b>
<b>to worry about with me. </b>

134
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,493
<b>You bring the merchandise</b>

135
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,029
<b>And don't let Mario worry you. </b>
<b>Mario's part of the furniture. </b>

136
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,638
<b><i>Querelle had no doubt that the realm</i></b>
<b><i>over which this fellow ruled... </i></b>

137
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,082
<b><i>was a terrestrial one. </i></b>

138
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:49,955
<b><i>But was it possible the police</i></b>

139
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,582
<b>Let's have a drink! </b>

140
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:56,920
<b>When will you be here? </b>

141
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:01,963

143
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,902
<b>Don't wanna burn my fingers. </b>

144

<b>Sure, why not? </b>

146
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:26,355

<b>A penny for your thoughts, Querelle. </b>

152
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:12,229
<b>I acknowledge the existence</b>

153
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:15,139
<b>I note his objective gestures. </b>

154
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,542
<b>Objectivity is the companion</b>

155
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,343
<b>It holds sway over</b>

164
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,340

166

167
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:04,584

173

174

178
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:37,481
<b>I'll do my best</b>

179

00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:20,171
<b>- I was Zephir. </b>
<b>- Zephir? </b>

291
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,510
<b>Legionnaire in a</b>
<b>prison detachment. </b>

292
00:27:24,617 --> 00:27:26,517
<b>Lie down on the table. </b>

293
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,923
<b>Come on. </b>
<b>It's gonna be fast. </b>

294
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,651
<b>That's how I like you. </b>

295
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,355
<b>This doesn't hurt. </b>

296
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,322
<b>I'll have to give you that. </b>

297
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,786
<b>You know your job. </b>

298
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:11,312
<b>Here goes nothing. </b>

299
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,601
<b>Morning, Lieutenant. </b>

300
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,804
<b>Hello, Querelle. </b>

301
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,846
<b>I must say, you're doing</b>
<b>a very good job. </b>

302
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:45,042
<b>Without even telling me, </b>
<b>you've offered to do another duty. </b>

303
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:49,015
<b>- Who ordered you to shovel coal? </b>
<b>- Nobody, sir. </b>

304
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,613
<b>Don't you find your job with me</b>
<b>a little more pleasant? </b>

305
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,921
<b>Sure, Lieutenant. Absolutely. </b>

306
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:58,922
<b>But this was a voluntary decision</b>
<b>to take over for a buddy. </b>

307
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,129
<b>They could have</b>
<b>found somebody else. </b>

308
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:05,104
<b>You look beautiful like this. </b>

309
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:09,430
<b>Do you find it so all that pleasant</b>
<b>swallowing coal dust? </b>

310
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:13,470
<b>No sir, but... </b>

311
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,144
<b>Yes? What were you going to say? </b>

312
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,080
<b>Nothing, sir. </b>

313
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,632
<b>Anything else you wanted, sir? </b>

314
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:41,530
<b>- No, why? </b>
<b>-Just asking, sir. </b>

315
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:45,566
<b>- And what are you going to do now? </b>
<b>- Nothing, sir. I'm at your disposal. </b>

316
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:49,046
<b>It's just that all my buddies</b>
<b>are down there alone. </b>

317
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,810
<b>Fine, then go back. </b>

318
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:51,017
<b><i>Each man kills the thing he loves</i></b>

319
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:54,180
<b><i>Each man kills the thing he loves</i></b>

320
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,437
<b>Your brother's a hot little number. </b>

321
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:19,774
<b>- Querelle? What do you mean by that? </b>
<b>- It worked real good with him. </b>

322
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:22,838
<b>- What worked? Your business deal? </b>
<b>- That worked out fine too. </b>

323
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:25,577
<b>But I mean something else. </b>
<b>I made it. </b>

324
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,782
<b>With Querelle? </b>

325
00:32:28,855 --> 00:32:30,550
<b>That's news to me. </b>

326
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,318
<b>I swear it. </b>

327
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:35,758
<b>But please don't talk about it. </b>
<b>Not with him either. </b>

328
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,455
<b>So what? </b>

329
00:32:39,866 --> 00:32:42,630
<b>It's none of my fuckin' business. </b>

330
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:46,067
<b>But you're not gonna make me believe</b>
<b>you fucked Querelle. </b>

331
00:32:46,138 --> 00:32:49,301
<b>I swear. </b>
<b>I fucked him in the ass. </b>

332
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:53,038
<b>And when I pulled my cock out, it was</b>
<b>covered with shit, if you want to know. </b>

333
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:56,980
<b>I've done it with damn near</b>
<b>all of them, except for you. </b>

334
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:59,407
<b>I never wanted you, understand? </b>

335
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:03,353
<b>This way I can say my wife slept</b>
<b>with nothing but assholes. </b>

336
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:07,119
<b>You're the only exception. </b>
<b>I don't know why. </b>

337
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,526
<b>I think we could've made it, </b>
<b>but I just didn't want to. </b>

338
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:14,123
<b>You don't interest me in the least. </b>
<b>You don't. </b>

339
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,964
<b>You're not any</b>
<b>uglier than the others. </b>

340
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,596
<b>I'm just not interested. </b>

341
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,720
<b>You're a little too screwy for me. </b>

342
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:39,914
<b>You should know that. </b>

343
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:55,434
<b>Hi, Mario. How's it going? </b>

344
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:58,943
<b>Comme ci, comme ça. </b>
<b>How are you? </b>

345
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:00,740
<b>Just fine. </b>

346
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,888
<b>- What you grinning about? </b>
<b>- Nothing special. </b>

347
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:24,027
<b>I just fucked Robert's brother. </b>
<b>Maybe that's why. </b>

348
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,833
<b>No kidding! Really? </b>

349
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:29,500
<b>It wasn't Robert, but what the hell? </b>
<b>It was his brother. </b>

350
00:34:29,575 --> 00:34:31,736
<b>Look at Nono. </b>

351
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:35,872
<b>Sometimes there's something</b>
<b>so female about him... </b>

352
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,385
<b>especially when he does</b>
<b>one of those sweet, silly gestures. </b>

353
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:45,319
<b>But this Querelle is an okay guy. </b>

354
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:50,185
<b>Hi, Nono. </b>

355
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:01,505
<b>Let's go outside. </b>

356
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:17,881
<b>Is that what you wanted? </b>

357
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:20,092
<b><i>Cornholer! </i></b>

358
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:21,821
<b><i>Cornholer! </i></b>

359
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:23,987
<b><i>Letting a nigger fuck you! </i></b>

360
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,867
<b><i>The two brothers resembled</i></b>
<b><i>each other more and more. </i></b>

361
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:13,810
<b><i>The combat in which they were engaged</i></b>
<b><i>was more like a lovers'quarrel. </i></b>

362
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:57,619
<b>Say it one more time! </b>

363
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,853
<b>Call me a cornholer again! </b>
<b>Say it one more time! </b>

364
00:37:00,926 --> 00:37:02,655
<b>I won't say it! </b>

365
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:35,592
<b>I cross the river</b>
<b>of creeping vines. </b>

366
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:38,129
<b>Help me. </b>
<b>I'm coming to your shore. </b>

367
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:42,327
<b>That will be hard, brother. </b>
<b>I can feel your resistance. </b>

368
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:45,131
<b>What do you say? </b>
<b>I can hardly hear it. </b>

369
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:48,696
<b>Jump on my laugh. Hold tight to it. </b>
<b>Don't worry about my pain. Jump! </b>

370
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:50,173
<b>Be yourself! </b>

371
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:52,301
<b>I'm becoming myself. </b>

372
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,477
<b>Talk more quietly. </b>

373
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:57,140
<b>I'm closer now. </b>

374
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:59,446
<b>I love you more than myself. </b>

375
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:02,146
<b>My hate was simply a camouflage. </b>

376
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:05,054
<b>A dangerous melancholy</b>
<b>draws me close to you... </b>

377
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:06,921
<b>but my battles separate us. </b>

378
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,257
<b>My laughter is the sun. </b>

379
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,763
<b>It drives away the shadows</b>
<b>you cast on me. </b>

380
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:17,826
<b>I seek out the daggers of the night. </b>
<b>I set up barricades. </b>

381
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:21,566
<b>My laughter locks me in. </b>
<b>It draws me away from you. </b>

382

<b>- You are beautiful. </b>
<b>- You are beautiful too. </b>

383
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:28,604
<b>Be quiet. </b>

384
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:32,614
<b>We mustn't lose ourselves</b>
<b>in an all too perfect unity. </b>

385

387
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:41,319
<b>Every fight crowns you</b>

388
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:44,521
<b>Don't lose courage. Work! </b>

<b><i>Cold and headache</i></b>

395

<b>A naval officer. </b>

<b>When I was a young man, </b>

397
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:46,050
<b>I didn't realize what a perfect alibi</b>
<b>a naval career provides. </b>

398
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:49,819
<b>It justifies celibacy. </b>

399
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:52,659
<b>Women don't ask, </b>
<b>"Why aren't you married?"</b>

400
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:56,394
<b>They pity you for knowing</b>
<b>only the transient affairs... </b>

401
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:59,061
<b>and never the true love. </b>

402
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,870
<b>The sea, the solitude... </b>

403
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,043
<b>Nobody asks me</b>
<b>whether or not I'm engaged. </b>

404
00:40:07,246 --> 00:40:09,544
<b>Neither my comrades... </b>

405
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,344

406
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,916
<b>From the time I fell in love</b>

407
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:18,354
<b>I've become</b>
<b>less of a disciplinarian. </b>

408
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:22,419
<b>My love makes me softer. </b>

409
00:40:24,163 --> 00:40:25,994
<b>The more I love Querelle... </b>

410
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,730
<b>the more gentle and definite... </b>

411
00:40:31,236 --> 00:40:33,932
<b>the sadder</b>

<b>achieve fulfillment. </b>

413
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,944

<b>defining my relationship</b>
<b>with Querelle... </b>

415
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,292

416
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,386
<b>"What's the point?"</b>

417
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,695
<b>That sailor got his throat slit? </b>

418

<b>Yeah. Nobody knows</b>

<b>I didn't know him well. </b>

421
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,011
<b>There is a masculine passivity... </b>

422

<b>which is expressed... </b>

423
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:24,513
<b>in the indifference</b>

434
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:57,675
<b><i>The absence of woman</i></b>
<b><i>forces the two males... </i></b>

438

444
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:35,752

445
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:40,020
<b>I know all about life. </b>
<b>Believe me. </b>

446
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:45,163
<b>Okay, I did it with Nono. </b>

447
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:49,861

450

<b>- But Nono did the fucking, right? </b>
<b>- Right. </b>

451
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:01,372
<b>- So? </b>
<b>- Forget it. </b>

452
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:04,040
<b>You don't have to prove to me</b>
<b>that you're a man. </b>

453
00:44:08,387 --> 00:44:09,718
<b>We know... </b>

454
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:14,456
<b>we're both men. </b>

455

457
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,596
<b>I hope you got</b>

458
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:23,430
<b>I won't say no. </b>

459
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:26,698
<b>I could do any guy</b>

460
00:44:26,772 --> 00:44:29,366
<b>You see, if it's fun, </b>

461
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:32,740
<b>I'm sure Nono enjoyed it just as much. </b>
<b>He's a pretty hot number. </b>

462
00:44:32,811 --> 00:44:34,938
<b>And you're very pretty. </b>

463

<b>- Bullshit! I can just see Nono now. </b>

464
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,243
<b>He must've had a hard-on</b>

465
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:46,680
<b>- Tell me, is he good at it? </b>
<b>- Cut it. </b>

466
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:51,827
<b>Tell me, is he a master of his craft? </b>

467
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,325
<b>What's so interesting</b>
<b>about it for you? </b>

468
00:44:57,002 --> 00:44:58,492
<b>Gets you all excited, doesn't it? </b>

469
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,936
<b>Maybe you'd like</b>
<b>a little taste of it yourself. </b>

470
00:45:01,006 --> 00:45:03,668
<b>Why not, if it's nice? </b>

471
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,176
<b>- Tell me, how does he do it? </b>
<b>- He does it well. </b>

472
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,940
<b>Are you satisfied now? </b>

473
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:12,245
<b>- Did you come? Was it super? </b>
<b>- Try it yourself. </b>

474
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:15,912
<b>- Tell me. Is it nice? </b>
<b>- It's not bad. </b>

475
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:20,254
<b>When he first puts it in, </b>
<b>that's a little painful... </b>

476
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,316
<b>then it's okay. </b>

477
00:45:22,394 --> 00:45:24,419
<b>Seriously, is it nice? </b>

478
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:29,323
<b>I just did it for the first time. </b>

479
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:37,635
<b>It's different than I thought. </b>

480
00:45:40,412 --> 00:45:43,506
<b>I'll bet he's got a big prick. </b>
<b>Did you like his prick? </b>

481
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:48,214
<b>I didn't pay any attention to that. </b>

482
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,653
<b>Well, if it's bugging you, </b>
<b>we can stop talking about it. </b>

483
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:54,488
<b>No, it's not bugging me. </b>

484
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,495
<b>When I talk about this stuff, </b>
<b>I get a mother of a hard-on. Believe me. </b>

485
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:00,621
<b>You're kidding! </b>

486
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,860
<b>- Don't you believe me? </b>
<b>- What, this gives you a hard-on? </b>

487
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,603
<b>Check it out. </b>
<b>Come on. Touch it. </b>

488
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,738
<b>Bullshit! </b>

489
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,912
<b>You haven't got one! </b>

490
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:22,948
<b>Go on. Touch it. </b>
<b>You'll feel it all right. </b>

491
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,365
<b>Nothing. </b>
<b>You call that a hard-on? </b>

492
00:46:36,435 --> 00:46:39,427
<b>Come on. Press it. </b>
<b>It's a monster! </b>

493
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:41,495
<b>Sure, the cloth makes it bigger. </b>

494
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:43,473
<b>Reach inside. You'll see. </b>

495
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,567
<b>Open it. </b>

496
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:47,373
<b>You'll see I'm not lying. </b>

497
00:47:03,528 --> 00:47:05,962
<b>You're right. Not bad. </b>

498
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,124
<b>You like it? </b>

499
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,964
<b>I told you, </b>
<b>size doesn't interest me. </b>

500
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,527
<b>Come on. </b>
<b>Give me a hand job. </b>

501
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,202
<b>This is supposed to be soup? </b>
<b>This is fucking dishwater! </b>

502
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:58,435
<b>Piss broth, </b>
<b>that's what that is! </b>

503
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:01,375
<b>You need vegetables in soup... </b>

504
00:49:01,446 --> 00:49:04,244
<b>but vegetables are getting</b>
<b>harder and harder to find. </b>

505
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,581
<b>Maybe we have to tighten up</b>
<b>our belts a little more. </b>

506
00:49:07,652 --> 00:49:10,450
<b>Maybe we could find some vegetables</b>
<b>around here somewhere. </b>

507
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:12,114
<b>Do you think so? </b>

508
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,454
<b>Maybe someone shoved</b>
<b>some up his ass. </b>

509
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:18,223
<b>There are people who dig that. </b>
<b>Eat through their assholes. </b>

510
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:21,392
<b>You thought out this little number, </b>
<b>didn't you, Theo? </b>

511
00:49:21,466 --> 00:49:23,434
<b>Well, let me tell you one thing: </b>

512
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,868
<b>I'm not going to put up</b>
<b>with this shit much longer! </b>

513
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:27,700
<b>What are you talking about? </b>

514
00:49:27,772 --> 00:49:30,240
<b>Gets you horny, turns you on, </b>
<b>doesn't it? </b>

515
00:49:30,308 --> 00:49:32,469
<b>But don't worry. </b>
<b>I'll always be here when you need me. </b>

516
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,607
<b>You want to fuck me? </b>

517
00:49:37,682 --> 00:49:39,547
<b>Don't be embarrassed! </b>

00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,509
<b>Go ahead! </b>

519
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,620
<b>And you guys laugh. </b>

520
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:50,886
<b>You think it's funny! </b>

521
00:49:50,962 --> 00:49:54,489
<b>Is there anybody else</b>
<b>who wants to fuck me? </b>

522
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:56,431
<b>Please! </b>

523
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:58,560
<b>Cut it out, Gil. </b>

524

<b>Your hassle with Theo's</b>
<b>none of our business. </b>

<b>Not one little shit! </b>

527
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:12,980
<b>Why didn't I smack Theo</b>
<b>in the mouth right then and there? </b>

528

<b>Why didn't I push</b>
<b>that motherfucker's face in? </b>

529
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:19,554
<b>Just 'cause the guy keeps</b>
<b>paying for my drinks? </b>

530
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:26,023
<b>I hate him because</b>
<b>he has power over me. </b>

531
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:29,123
<b>I wanted to be his friend, </b>
<b>but not like that. </b>

532
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,760
<b>He made a fool of me</b>
<b>in front of all of them. </b>

533
00:50:31,836 --> 00:50:35,363
<b>And all because I didn't</b>

534
00:50:37,776 --> 00:50:41,268
<b>Why didn't I push</b>

<b>Roger, my mate, </b>

<b>- Okay, I guess. </b>

547
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,265
<b>You don't have to</b>
<b>worry about me. </b>

548
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:43,239
<b>There ain't no Theo anymore. </b>

549

<b>You don't have to put me</b>
<b>in the same boat as him. </b>

550
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:48,768
<b>I'm no faggot, </b>

551
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:50,712
<b>He's a whore, a cocksucker. </b>

552
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:53,717
<b>You and me, we're friends. </b>

553
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:58,415
<b>And we've got a right to be. </b>
<b>But he's just a dirty motherfucker. </b>

554
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,924
<b>I think you've had</b>
<b>a little bit too much to drink. </b>

555
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,119
<b>Don't get in a state. </b>

556
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:06,163
<b>I paid for it</b>
<b>with my own money. </b>

557
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:08,665
<b>He can take his money... </b>

558
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:11,497
<b>and shove it</b>

<b>Are you buying? </b>
<b>I'm here with a friend. </b>

<b>Sure. Why not, honey? </b>

565
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:44,366
<b>And now you're not</b>

566
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:50,108
<b>How did you meet Gil? </b>

567
00:52:50,108 --> 00:52:51,735
<b>How did you meet Gil? </b>

568
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:55,507
<b>Easy, just like that. </b>
<b>He was after my sister. </b>

569
00:52:56,681 --> 00:53:00,549
<b>Did he have an affair</b>

570
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:03,052
<b>With Paulette? No. Why? </b>

571
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:06,485
<b>Because we found these pictures</b>
<b>under his pillow. </b>

572
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,788
<b>I've nothing to say to that. </b>

573
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,990
<b>Did you make it with him? </b>
<b>Did you and he have an affair? </b>

574
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:17,999
<b>Never, Inspector. I swear it. </b>

575
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:22,967
<b>And this Theo, </b>
<b>the one Gil murdered... </b>

576
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,975
<b>did you make it with him? </b>

577
00:53:25,043 --> 00:53:28,843
<b>Jesus Christ, I only knew him</b>
<b>from seeing him around. </b>

578
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:32,614
<b>But this Gil must</b>
<b>surely have tried to seduce you. </b>

579
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,378
<b>No, never, Inspector. </b>

580
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:37,284
<b>Whatever gave you that idea? </b>

581
00:53:37,355 --> 00:53:39,118
<b>Simply because Gil is gay. </b>

582
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:41,784
<b>- That's not true! </b>
<b>- How could you be so goddamn sure? </b>

583
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,454
<b>Because he was after my sister, </b>
<b>that's why. </b>

584
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:46,019
<b>He never tried to touch you? </b>

585
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:50,292
<b>- What do you mean, "touch" me? </b>
<b>- You know what I mean. </b>

586
00:53:50,368 --> 00:53:52,302
<b>Did he do anything indecent to you? </b>

587
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:54,933
<b>I already told you: nothing. </b>

588
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:57,031
<b>Did he ever run his hands</b>
<b>over your pants? </b>

589
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:01,269
<b>Didn't he even try</b>
<b>to touch your crotch? </b>

590
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:04,611
<b>No. He never did. </b>

591
00:54:04,682 --> 00:54:07,845
<b>It's like I said. </b>
<b>He never touched me. </b>

592
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,116
<b>Okay. </b>

593
00:54:15,326 --> 00:54:20,320
<b><i>They couldn't pull anything out of him, </i></b>
<b><i>who now loved Gil all the more. </i></b>

594
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:25,732
<b><i>At first he loved him as a child whose</i></b>
<b><i>imagination is quick and exhilarating. </i></b>

595
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,837
<b><i>Crime enabled him</i></b>
<b><i>to penetrate a world... </i></b>

596
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:30,875
<b><i>where feelings are violent. </i></b>

597
00:54:34,846 --> 00:54:36,438
<b>You can go now. </b>

598
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:40,416
<b>What sudden desire? </b>
<b>I am nothing but desire. </b>

599
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:42,910
<b>At first, only mechanically... </b>

600
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:46,081
<b>my hands formed</b>
<b>female breasts on my chest... </b>

601
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,352
<b>as if they had been grafted there. </b>

602
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:50,155
<b>I was happy. </b>

603
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:54,927
<b>I went through the motions again, </b>
<b>and I feel happy. </b>

604
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:56,557
<b>I am filled. </b>

605
00:54:56,634 --> 00:55:00,092
<b>I take my hands away, </b>
<b>I am filled. </b>

606
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,349
<b>- Are you looking for me? </b>
<b>- Yes, we are. </b>

607
00:55:22,427 --> 00:55:26,454
<b>- That is if you're Lieutenant Seblon. </b>
<b>- Yes, I am. </b>

608
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,557
<b>We are from the police. </b>
<b>It has to do with that murdered sailor. </b>

609
00:55:29,634 --> 00:55:33,229
<b>You mean Vic? </b>
<b>That's what I thought. </b>

610
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:35,067
<b>You don't say. </b>

611
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,541
<b>Yes, we're investigating</b>
<b>this Vic Rivette case... </b>

612
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,476
<b>and so far we haven't</b>
<b>made much progress. </b>

613
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,673
<b>- Really? </b>
<b>- Yes. </b>

614
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:46,239
<b>But maybe you could</b>
<b>tell me if this Vic Rivette... </b>

615
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:49,150
<b>had a special relationship</b>
<b>with any of his mates. </b>

616
00:55:50,955 --> 00:55:54,618
<b>How do you think a love relationship</b>
<b>like that could be recognized? </b>

617
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:57,661
<b>I didn't say anything</b>
<b>about a "love relationship."</b>

618
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,755
<b>No? Then I probably</b>
<b>misunderstood you. </b>

619
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:02,163
<b>Probably... </b>

620
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:06,670
<b>but perhaps you know more</b>
<b>about this Vic's associations. </b>

621
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:11,500
<b>The physical relationships of my boys</b>
<b>have nothing to do with me. </b>

622
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,908
<b>And even if someone had killed Vic... </b>

623
00:56:13,978 --> 00:56:17,470
<b>in connection with one of these</b>
<b>adventures, I wouldn't be informed. </b>

624
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:20,517
<b>Of course, Lieutenant, </b>
<b>but it would be possible... </b>

625
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:23,452
<b>that you might have heard</b>
<b>something about it, wouldn't it? </b>

626
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,553
<b>You must be joking. </b>
<b>I don't spy on my men. </b>

627
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:31,424
<b>Besides, take it from me. </b>

628
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:34,556
<b>These young people, when they get</b>
<b>involved with shady individuals... </b>

629
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:36,623
<b>they certainly don't</b>
<b>like to talk about it. </b>

630
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,794
<b>I believe these meetings... </b>

631
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:41,134
<b>are enveloped in dark secrets. </b>

632
00:56:41,205 --> 00:56:44,936
<b>These shady characters</b>
<b>are extremely well-organized. </b>

633
00:56:46,511 --> 00:56:51,039
<b>You seem to have given this particular</b>
<b>matter quite a bit of thought. </b>

634
00:56:51,115 --> 00:56:52,946
<b>It only seems like it. </b>

635
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:55,542
<b>Basically, I'm not at all interested</b>
<b>in this kind of thing. </b>

636
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:58,552
<b>Really? </b>

637
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,614
<b>By the way, has your alibi</b>
<b>been checked out yet? </b>

638
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:01,989
<b>My alibi? </b>

639
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,093
<b>But of course. You can</b>
<b>check your files on that. </b>

640
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:08,325
<b>Are you sure? </b>

641
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,462
<b>All the best, Lieutenant. </b>

642
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,333
<b>All the best. </b>

643
00:57:32,256 --> 00:57:35,657
<b>Do I have charms</b>
<b>which might conquer another? </b>

644
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:39,219
<b>And who, besides myself, has been</b>
<b>conquered by Querelle's charms? </b>

645
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:40,958
<b>How could I become him? </b>

646
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,096
<b>I push up my pajama sleeves... </b>

647
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:46,864
<b>to keep them from getting</b>
<b>in my way when I jerk off. </b>

648
00:57:46,938 --> 00:57:49,463
<b>This simple motion</b>
<b>makes a man out of me. </b>

649
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,601
<b>Thus I appear as a lion tamer</b>
<b>before Querelle. </b>

650
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:56,941
<b>But all of this</b>
<b>will end tragically. </b>

651
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,145
<b>Have the cops questioned you? </b>

652
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:02,618
<b>Yeah, but I didn't say a word. </b>

653
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,985
<b>What was there to say? </b>

654
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:06,216
<b>Right. </b>

655
00:58:08,993 --> 00:58:10,654
<b>And Paulette? </b>

656
00:58:11,162 --> 00:58:13,653
<b>What's Paulette doing now? </b>

657
00:58:14,198 --> 00:58:15,631
<b>Nothing special. </b>

658
00:58:16,634 --> 00:58:18,898
<b>She still hasn't</b>
<b>gone back to work. </b>

659
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,870
<b>She just sits around the house. </b>

660
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:23,536
<b>Did you talk to her about me? </b>

661
00:58:23,608 --> 00:58:25,405
<b>I don't think that's a good idea. </b>

662
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:28,502
<b>It's too dangerous. Paulette can't</b>
<b>always keep her trap shut. </b>

663
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:30,978
<b>Your picture was in the paper. </b>

664
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,314
<b>They say you've got that sailor</b>
<b>on your conscience too. </b>

665
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,877
<b>Says who? </b>

666
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:39,547
<b>The police. </b>

667
00:58:40,324 --> 00:58:42,155
<b>It was in the paper. </b>

668
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:43,887
<b>Bullshit! </b>

669
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:50,295
<b>They don't believe</b>
<b>that fairy tale themselves. </b>

670
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:53,796
<b>They found your lighter</b>
<b>next to the corpse. </b>

671
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:55,395
<b>My lighter? </b>

672
00:58:55,473 --> 00:58:59,876
<b>God, I must have lost that ages ago, </b>
<b>didn't I? </b>

673
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:03,004
<b>- I think so. </b>
<b>- There, you see? </b>

674
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:05,740
<b>Boy, your sister! </b>

675
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:09,651
<b>Could I do with</b>
<b>a piece of her right now! </b>

676
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,688
<b>She's so cute. </b>

677
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,247
<b>- She looks like me. </b>
<b>- I know. </b>

678
00:59:14,859 --> 00:59:16,827
<b>But she's prettier. </b>

679
00:59:21,899 --> 00:59:25,426
<b>If I were holding her</b>
<b>like I'm holding you now... </b>

680
00:59:25,503 --> 00:59:28,233
<b>I'd make out with her</b>
<b>like crazy. </b>

681
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:33,910
<b>Too bad you're not a girl. </b>

682
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,187
<b>Really? </b>

683
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,553
<b>You're definitely</b>
<b>as pretty as a girl. </b>

684
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:53,361
<b>What's the matter? </b>
<b>Scared? </b>

685
00:59:53,431 --> 00:59:54,455
<b>No. </b>

686
00:59:54,532 --> 00:59:58,059
<b>What then? </b>
<b>What do you think I want? </b>

687
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:04,971
<b>You don't feel safe</b>
<b>with a guy like me... </b>

688
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,771
<b>do you? </b>

689
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:09,005
<b>What do you mean? </b>

690
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,674
<b>If I didn't, I wouldn't</b>
<b>have come here, would I? </b>

691
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:13,114
<b>Right. </b>

692
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:19,385
<b>You've got to see Robert. </b>

693
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:22,392
<b>I've been thinking this over. </b>

694
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,294
<b>He and his friends might be able</b>
<b>to help me get out of here. </b>

695
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,227
<b>Okay, Gil. </b>

696
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:32,598
<b>I'll try to get</b>
<b>in contact with Robert. </b>

697
01:00:33,704 --> 01:00:36,195
<b>I think it's better you leave now. </b>

698
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,549
<b>- Yes? </b>
<b>- Come over here. </b>

699
01:00:53,658 --> 01:00:55,387
<b>I know you. </b>

700
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:57,620
<b>You're that friend ofTurko's. </b>

701
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:01,563
<b>Gil Turko, the one</b>
<b>who committed the murder. </b>

702
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,327
<b>Don't you know me? </b>

703
01:01:04,402 --> 01:01:07,235
<b>Yeah, you're Querelle... </b>

704
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:08,829
<b>Robert's brother. </b>

705
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,498
<b>Right. </b>

706
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,240
<b>Thought I might be able to help</b>
<b>your friend if he's still in Brest. </b>

707
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:18,407
<b>What do you think? </b>

708
01:01:18,482 --> 01:01:21,918
<b>Well, since you're Robert's brother... </b>

709
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:24,414
<b>I'll be right back. </b>

710
01:01:24,488 --> 01:01:28,686
<b><i>An uneasiness filled Querelle, </i></b>
<b><i>troubling his mind. </i></b>

711
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:31,990
<b><i>For the first time he was</i></b>

712
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:36,159

<b><i>he would be able to talk business. </i></b>

713
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,225
<b>I met Querelle. </b>
<b>You know, Robert's brother? </b>

714
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:40,236
<b>He wants to help you. </b>
<b>Should I bring him here? </b>

715
01:01:40,304 --> 01:01:42,238
<b>Sure! Why didn't you</b>
<b>bring him in the first place? </b>

716
01:01:42,306 --> 01:01:44,968
<b>- I thought that... </b>
<b>- Hurry up! Get him! </b>

717
01:01:47,278 --> 01:01:50,179
<b>It's okay. Come with me. </b>

718
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,750
<b>- Thanks, kid. </b>
<b>- My name's Roger. Roger Bataille. </b>

719
01:01:57,188 --> 01:02:00,157
<b>Thanks, Roger. Roger Bataille. </b>

720
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,123
<b><i>Now, in this abandoned prison... </i></b>

721
01:02:03,194 --> 01:02:06,391
<b><i>Querelle was to meet</i></b>
<b><i>a young fellow who had killed. </i></b>

722
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:09,299
<b><i>This thought filled</i></b>
<b><i>him with tenderness. </i></b>

723
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:13,866
<b><i>The murderer was an awkward kid</i>... </b>
<b><i>a murderer for nothing. </i></b>

724
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,667
<b><i>A fool. </i></b>

725
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,074
<b><i>But, thanks to Querelle, he would be</i></b>
<b><i>adorned with a true murder. </i></b>

726
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,346
<b>Tell me... </b>

727
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:35,148
<b>why did you</b>
<b>knock that sailor off? </b>

728
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:42,492
<b>I don't understand that. </b>

729
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:48,933
<b>Come on. Tell me. </b>
<b>Why did you do that to the sailor? </b>

730
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:50,999
<b>He didn't do it. </b>

731
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:57,145
<b>- If he didn't, who did? </b>
<b>- Word of honor. I didn't do it. </b>

732
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:02,346
<b>I can't tell you who did it, </b>
<b>but I swear... </b>

733
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,012
<b>it wasn't me. </b>

734
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:06,488
<b>The paper said you did it. </b>

735
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:13,320
<b>I believe you... </b>

736
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,999
<b>but you'll never</b>
<b>convince the police. </b>

737
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,068
<b>They found your lighter</b>
<b>next to the body. </b>

738
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:26,640
<b>Get out, Roger. Get lost! </b>

739
01:03:26,711 --> 01:03:31,171
<b>I can't stand another minute</b>
<b>of you today. Get the hell out! </b>

740
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:43,489
<b>I lost my lighter. </b>

741
01:03:44,228 --> 01:03:46,389
<b>I didn't even notice it. </b>

742
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:51,967
<b>How can a lighter</b>
<b>be so important? </b>

743
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:56,632
<b>Finally I know why you won't let</b>
<b>the other girls wear black lingerie. </b>

744
01:03:58,976 --> 01:04:00,034
<b>Why? </b>

745
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:04,878
<b>Because you alone are</b>
<b>ennobled by this black. </b>

746
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,143
<b>It makes you so beautiful... </b>

747
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,620
<b>gives you a solemn air... </b>

748
01:04:12,356 --> 01:04:15,587
<b>and at the same time</b>
<b>you are unbearably hot. </b>

749
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:20,930
<b>Do I make you hot? </b>

750
01:04:25,836 --> 01:04:27,565
<b>Want to see? </b>

751
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,202
<b>Okay, get started. </b>

752
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:46,414
<b>You're alone in the world. </b>

753
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:49,982
<b>The night lies</b>
<b>over the solitude... </b>

754
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,722
<b>of an endless space. </b>

755
01:04:52,797 --> 01:04:57,131
<b>Like a double mirror image</b>
<b>of your brother... </b>

756
01:04:57,868 --> 01:05:00,860
<b>you live in your double solitude. </b>

757
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,039
<b>You upset me. </b>

758
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:09,279
<b>There's no reason to hide it. </b>

759
01:05:09,346 --> 01:05:11,940
<b>Your similarity does me in. </b>

760
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:16,449
<b>I'm sick of your obscenities. </b>

761
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:20,479
<b>Right? </b>
<b>Your obscenities. </b>

762
01:05:21,492 --> 01:05:23,619
<b>Don't you think I know? </b>

763
01:05:24,695 --> 01:05:26,458
<b>I'm sick of it. </b>

764
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,529
<b>All you ever look at</b>

766

<b>Who am I then? </b>
<b>Where do I fit in? </b>

767
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:42,135
<b>You only live</b>
<b>in your brother's eyes. </b>

768
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:46,411
<b>Inside your brother, </b>

769
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:50,219
<b>There's no room</b>

770
01:05:50,287 --> 01:05:51,982
<b>I'm at the door. </b>

771

772

773
01:05:58,362 --> 01:06:00,523
<b><i>Her mind was clouded</i></b>

774
01:06:00,598 --> 01:06:05,126

775
01:06:05,202 --> 01:06:07,534
<b><i>She tried to force</i></b>

791
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:41,757

793

824
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:39,942
<b>There's nothing more to it than there</b>

01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,788
<b>Hi. </b>

1008
01:26:37,834 --> 01:26:39,859

1011
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:47,000

1013

01:26:58,421 --> 01:26:59,979
<b>Nobody. </b>

1015
01:27:00,056 --> 01:27:01,614
<b>Never. </b>

1016
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,484

1017
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,188

1019

1026

1029
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,536

<b><i>a feeling for this authority... </i></b>

1030
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:02,601
<b><i>in the heart of the sailors. </i></b>

1031
01:29:04,113 --> 01:29:05,978
<b><i>They ought to love me. </i></b>

1032
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,711
<b><i>I want to be their father</i></b>
<b><i>and injure them. </i></b>

1033
01:29:09,785 --> 01:29:12,879

1034
01:29:12,955 --> 01:29:16,914

<b><i>I shall remain unmoved. </i></b>

1035
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:22,522
<b><i>More and more, the feeling</i></b>

1036
01:29:24,433 --> 01:29:28,267
<b><i>Having conquered my compassion, </i></b>
<b><i>I shall be strong... </i></b>

1037

1041
01:29:45,154 --> 01:29:47,554

1046

1049
01:30:11,347 --> 01:30:14,874

1050
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:18,409

1051
01:30:18,487 --> 01:30:22,218

<b><i>if it is to achieve the victory. </i></b>

1052
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:26,557
<b><i>And humility can only</i></b>
<b><i>be born of humiliation. </i></b>

1053
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:30,360

1055
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,708
<b>- Good morning, Lieutenant. </b>
<b>- Good morning. What can I do for you? </b>

1056
01:30:42,778 --> 01:30:46,179
<b>Would you be good enough</b>
<b>to come with me to the police station? </b>

1057
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:48,682
<b>Certainly. </b>
<b>For what reason? </b>

1058
01:30:48,751 --> 01:30:52,414
<b>I want you to look at a suspect. </b>
<b>It concerns the robbery. </b>

1059
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,085
<b>- You have a suspect then, do you? </b>
<b>- We have. </b>

1060
01:31:00,763 --> 01:31:02,697
<b>Is that a fact? </b>

1061
01:31:04,567 --> 01:31:07,627
<b>Then I'll be glad</b>
<b>to come along with you. </b>

1062
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:09,862
<b>Let's go. </b>

1063
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:21,177
<b><i>Querelle was now Lysiane's lover. </i></b>

1064
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:24,242
<b><i>The excitement she felt thinking about</i></b>
<b><i>the identity of the two brothers... </i></b>

1065
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,450
<b><i>exasperated her</i></b>
<b><i>to such a degree that she felt lost. </i></b>

1066
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:32,456
<b>What did you hope to achieve... </b>

1067
01:31:32,528 --> 01:31:34,621
<b>by attacking</b>
<b>your fellow worker Theo Celine? </b>

1068
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:37,996
<b>- I wanted to kill him. </b>
<b>- You did? </b>

1069
01:31:38,801 --> 01:31:42,202
<b>So you already thought of killing him</b>
<b>when you broke the bottle... </b>

1070
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:43,898
<b>with which</b>
<b>you mortally wounded him? </b>

1071
01:31:43,973 --> 01:31:46,840
<b>Yes, I wanted to kill him. </b>

1072
01:31:46,909 --> 01:31:51,141
<b>So, before you hit him, it was clear</b>
<b>that you might kill him with the bottle? </b>

1073
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:54,506
<b>Absolutely, Inspector. </b>

1074
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:56,414
<b>I wanted to kill him. </b>

1075
01:31:57,486 --> 01:31:59,010
<b>Why did you want to do that? </b>

1076
01:31:59,855 --> 01:32:02,619
<b>He hurt my honor and my soul. </b>

1077
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,824
<b>How did he do that? </b>

1078
01:32:06,896 --> 01:32:09,956
<b>He made fun of me</b>
<b>in front of everybody... </b>

1079
01:32:10,032 --> 01:32:11,863
<b>including myself. </b>

1080
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:14,334
<b>And that was reason enough</b>
<b>for you to kill a man? </b>

1081
01:32:16,839 --> 01:32:19,774
<b>Can one man do</b>
<b>anything worse to another... </b>

1082
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:21,605
<b>than hurting his honor? </b>

1083
01:32:22,478 --> 01:32:23,945
<b>Well... </b>

1084
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:30,316
<b>I suppose there are some differences</b>
<b>of opinion on that subject. </b>

1085
01:32:34,523 --> 01:32:36,388
<b>I repeat once again: </b>

1086
01:32:36,459 --> 01:32:38,950
<b>you killed the sailor Vic Rivette</b>
<b>to rob him of his money... </b>

1087
01:32:39,028 --> 01:32:42,896
<b>and you killed Theo Celine</b>
<b>because he hurt your honor. </b>

1088
01:32:42,965 --> 01:32:44,455
<b>Is that correct? </b>

1089
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:49,537
<b>Yes. </b>

1090
01:32:50,339 --> 01:32:51,806
<b>That's correct. </b>

1091
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:57,306
<b>And the robbery</b>
<b>of Naval Lieutenant Seblon? </b>

1092
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:01,413
<b>It's exactly as I told you. </b>

1093
01:33:01,484 --> 01:33:03,281
<b>I had nothing to do with that one. </b>

1094
01:33:03,352 --> 01:33:06,378
<b>You're sticking</b>
<b>to your story on that. Fine. </b>

1095
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:09,148
<b>- Marcellin? </b>
<b>- Yes, Inspector. </b>

1096
01:33:16,432 --> 01:33:18,559
<b>Well, Lieutenant, here he is. </b>

1097
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,400
<b>Do you recognize him? </b>

1098
01:33:25,774 --> 01:33:27,799
<b>You, take off your hat. </b>

1099
01:33:30,513 --> 01:33:31,639
<b>And get up. </b>

1100
01:33:39,288 --> 01:33:40,778
<b>No, it's not him. </b>

1101
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:44,952
<b>I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I must ask you</b>
<b>to think this one over very carefully. </b>

1102
01:33:45,027 --> 01:33:47,860
<b>Maybe you do remember</b>
<b>this young man. </b>

1103
01:33:48,764 --> 01:33:50,629
<b>I don't understand</b>
<b>what you're getting at. </b>

1104
01:33:50,699 --> 01:33:55,329
<b>I'm concerned with justice too. </b>
<b>I can't accuse an innocent man. </b>

1105
01:33:55,404 --> 01:33:56,928
<b>Are you absolutely certain? </b>

1106
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:58,564
<b>Absolutely. </b>

1107
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:03,273
<b>I would have recognized him right away</b>
<b>because his face was right next to mine. </b>

1108
01:34:09,552 --> 01:34:11,213
<b>Lieutenant, you may go now. </b>

1109
01:34:11,287 --> 01:34:14,586
<b>You haven't even</b>
<b>got a decent hard-on. </b>

1110
01:34:16,725 --> 01:34:19,319
<b>It doesn't stay up forever. </b>

1111
01:34:20,863 --> 01:34:23,058
<b>Buy yourself a rubber one. </b>

1112
01:34:26,969 --> 01:34:28,561
<b>You know... </b>

1113
01:34:29,772 --> 01:34:33,071
<b>I've dreamt a lot</b>

1114
01:34:35,077 --> 01:34:36,567
<b>Yeah? </b>

1115
01:34:37,313 --> 01:34:39,781
<b>Was it nicer in your dreams? </b>

1116
01:34:40,282 --> 01:34:41,579
<b>No. </b>

1117
01:34:43,485 --> 01:34:45,612
<b>I'm very satisfied. </b>

1118
01:34:47,323 --> 01:34:52,886
<b>You have a solid, heavy, </b>

1119
01:34:54,496 --> 01:34:57,329
<b>Not elegant, but strong. </b>

1120
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:01,797
<b>And so different from Robert's. </b>

1121
01:35:03,372 --> 01:35:05,067
<b>Different how? </b>

1122
01:35:07,943 --> 01:35:10,844
<b>Your prick has more character. </b>

1123
01:35:16,151 --> 01:35:19,609
<b>Why did you refuse me for so long? </b>

1124
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:22,282
<b>I didn't refuse you. </b>

1125
01:35:23,192 --> 01:35:26,821

1126
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,725
<b>And now? </b>

1127
01:35:32,868 --> 01:35:35,894
<b>Now I'm getting revenge</b>

1128
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:42,506

1129
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:45,876
<b>that's the reason. </b>

1130
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,614

1131
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:01,290
<b>And me? </b>

1132
01:36:02,598 --> 01:36:04,190
<b>You? </b>

1133
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:08,467
