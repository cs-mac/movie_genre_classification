SISTERS OF THE GION

3
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,781
Master,

4
00:01:55,824 --> 00:02:00,953
all the familiar furniture
being auctioned off like that...

5
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,540
I can hardly bear it.

6
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,750
Can't be helped.

7
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,962
Let's hope for the best.

8
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,464
Sadakichi,

9
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,717
you've been here a long time.

10
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,721
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

11
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:26,687
Master, I'm the one who's sorry -
for not having been able to do more.

12
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,273
I've made arrangements

13
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:33,152
for you to work at Kageyoshi's.

14
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,446
His store is doing well.

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,951
Thank you for your kindness.

16
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:49,751
Miss, will you be leaving for your native
town tomorrow with Mr Furusawa?

17
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,171
I plan to.

18
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,507
I'll help you pack, if I may.

19
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,595
Thank you. But I don't have much left.

20
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,807
Hardly more than what I'm wearing.

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,813
They're auctioning off all the things
I brought as a bride.

22
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:17,029
No one else in town
had as fine a dowry as mine.

23
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,073
But to return so miserably...

24
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,704
How will I ever be able to face my family?

25
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,247
Stop repeating that.

26
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,795
My ears ache. No one likes bankruptcy.

27
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:41,220
To think that even our child will have to
feel small among other children.

28
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,765
I can't... I simply can't...

29
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,559
Complaints, then tears.

30
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,063
If you have so much to say

31
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,566
about this shop folding,

32
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,320
about your things being sold,

33
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,909
shout it outside.

34
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,994
Where are you going?

35
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,164
Out. I can't stand to look at you any longer.

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,334
- I can't live with you any more.
- Wait!

37
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,878
Master!

38
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,304
Does anyone want flowers or tea?

39
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:29,142
I have flour, too.

40
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,898
Flowers or tea, anyone?

41
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,778
Does anyone want flowers or tea?

42
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,447
Flowers or tea...

43
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,498
- It's hot.
- Welcome.

44
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,710
How are things at your store?

45
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,922
Hopeless. I'm at the end of my tether.

46
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,054
Why not sell something of mine?
Would that help?

47
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,806
Not really.

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,809
Don't worry.

49
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:15,397
You've been so good to me.
I'd like to help if I can.

50
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,319
Take anything you want from here.

51
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,279
That's enough.

52
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,699
I'm sick of it all.

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,082
Good morning, Omocha.

54
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,584
Welcome.

55
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,420
I'm becoming a member of this family.

56
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,173
- Thank you for welcoming me.
- Is that so?

57
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,427
I'll do all your errands from now on.

58
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,012
Stop joking.

59
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,310
You're perspiring.
Let me wash your things.

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,690
Go to the public bath.
Wash away those unpleasant feelings.

61
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,692
Good idea.

62
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,370
So untidy-looking, sweating like that.

63
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:16,375
- Better go.
- My fortune has indeed waned.

64
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:23,632
The drop of a single leaf heralding autumn -
that's how it is.

65
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,218
Hurry back.

66
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,021
I'm opposed...
to letting him sponge off of us.

67
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,732
What a thing to say.

68
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,236
I can't be indifferent to his plight.

69
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,698
His business failed. So what?

70
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,661
Don't talk like that. We have an obligation.

71
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,582
We can't do much, even if he does stay.

72
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,335
But we can try to comfort him.

73
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,546
Why should we?

74
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,091
We're in no position to help him.

75
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,637
Autumn's coming
but we don't have new kimonos.

76
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,682
We're three to four months behind in rent.

77
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:21,690
It's not as if his coming here
will add to our expenses.

78
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,654
Your attitude towards men is entirely wrong.

79
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,534
"Obligation?" I dislike that word.

80
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,997
I don't know how much he's done for you.

81
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,709
You've already repaid it.

82
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:46,173
You grew up in the geisha quarters.
Maybe that's why.

83
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,677
I graduated from school. I can tell.

84
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,640
The men who come here use their money

85
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,728
to make playthings of us, that's all.

86
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,023
Men are all alike.

87
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,777
I don't need you to tell me.
I already know that.

88
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,738
Then act like you know it.

89
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:15,911
Since men are that way,
get all you can from them.

90
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:21,249
Never be the loser.
Don't let a poor man live off us.

91
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,713
What has he done for you?
Why feel so obliged to him?

92
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,883
He helped me become
a fully-fledged geisha.

93
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,593
For what?

94
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,140
So you'd be able to give any man pleasure?

95
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,434
Isn't that all?

96
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:46,525
Turning us into playthings.
Bought and sold like merchandise.

97
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,780
Men are our enemies.

98
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,949
Hateful enemies.

99
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:59,704
We should make them pay and pay.

100
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:06,127
You've been deceived by words
like "obligation" or "human empathy".

101
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,630
Men do just as they please.

102
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:21,351
Sister, break up with Mr Furusawa.

103
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,148
When he comes back, tell him.
Make him go away.

104
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,903
We can't get along
with an attitude like that.

105
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:38,243
In the case of men solely seeking pleasure,
what you say may be true.

106
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,414
It's different if there's an obligation.

107
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,749
Society has its rules.

108
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,797
Listen, Omocha.

109
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,135
What would people say
if I did things your way?

110
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,554
They would be critical.

111
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:04,102
So you'll take care of Mr Furusawa
to be praised by society?

112
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:12,068
Has that society ever treated us
like human beings?

113
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,741
Why must we curry its favour?

114
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:24,456
If you continue like this,
it'll be a slow death by strangulation.

115
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,920
Look at the other geishas
who have saved up money.

116
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,673
- Good morning, Omocha.
- Come to pray?

117
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,219
Would you like to hear
something nice, Omocha?

118
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,471
What is it?

119
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,807
Someone is very fond of you.

120
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,018
That's nice. Who is it?

121
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:50,357
Mr Kimura of the dry-goods shop.
He calls at your place often.

122
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,651
Him? Oh, bother.

123
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,737
Don't say that. Be kind to him.

124
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,531
- How silly! Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

125
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,287
Good morning.

126
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,540
Good morning,
I've been wanting to speak to you.

127
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,833
About what?

128
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:13,797
There's a dance performance
on the fifth of next month.

129
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,509
Your sister wants to be in it.

130
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,053
- Can you arrange it?
- Yes.

131
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,768
This is something I can't tell her...

132
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,353
so I'm telling you.

133
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,815
She's a skilful dancer

134
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,610
but does she have
a proper kimono to wear?

135
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,824
It's a very exclusive affair.

136
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,910
My reputation would be affected.

137
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,789
Did you hear what she said?

138
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,291
After making us second-raters
work like mad.

139
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,335
That's how she is...

140
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:57,215
Please help her take part
in the dances.

141
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,301
It depends on the kimono she can get.

142
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,512
We'll manage somehow.

143
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,809
It'll be a good chance for my sister
to find a wealthy patron.

144
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,770
Really, I worry for her.

145
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,648
- That's right.
- Mother...

146
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,901
will you listen to my story?
It makes me angry.

147
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,238
- You know that Mr Furusawa?
- The man who went bankrupt?

148
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,200
Yes. He expects us to support him.

149
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,036
Thanks for looking after the house.

150
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,998
A little mouse didn't come and nibble you?

151
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:35,128
"You're late, you're late.
It was the plaintive cry."

152
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,006
"The fault is mine and mine alone."

153
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,468
I'm so tired.

154
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,720
- Want some tea?
- Thank you.

155
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,389
I bought this.

156
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,477
Do you think it will suit you?

157
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,399
I'll look better than a kabuki actor.

158
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,486
It's the season for woollen clothing.

159
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,904
Thanks a lot.

160
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:07,035
I also bought something
that I know you like to eat.

161
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,369
See?

162
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,041
Wow.

163
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,878
- Good.
- Isn't it?

164
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,089
Lunch will be here soon. Please be patient.

165
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,466
Thanks.

166
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,975
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

167
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,356
- Your money...
- Thanks.

168
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,489
I'm sorry. I'll pay you next time.

169
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,911
Next time? My boss is very strict.

170
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,372
Don't forget.

171
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,376
Hello.

172
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,590
- Business good?
- So-so. Not great.

173
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,134
Busy season is starting.

174
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,637
- Let's hope so.
- Mr Kimura?

175
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,973
How are you, Omocha?

176
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,976
- You bad man.
- What?

177
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,106
You said something to Umeryu about me.

178
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,442
You heard about that?

179
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,487
Yes, I did.

180
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,365
Keen on each other, are you?

181
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,076
- That's silly.
- Don't tempt her.

182
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,413
- I'll behave.
- See that you do.

183
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,583
- Mr Kimura...
- Yes?

184
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:41,337
I need a new kimono.
Do you have anything nice?

185
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,882
- Autumn wear?
- Yes.

186
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,553
I have some with me.

187
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,806
I'm on my way to Hanamikoji Street
with a very fine assortment.

188
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,226
Let me see them. I'll take one.

189
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,104
They are quite expensive.

190
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,316
There are cheaper ones.

191
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,737
It's not possible to lower the price.

192
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,033
Wouldn't rayon be better for you?

193
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:15,538
In which case,
you might ask at some other stores.

194
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,667
You're being cruel.

195
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,798
Was what you told Umeryu about me a lie?

196
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,844
- I meant it.
- I doubt that.

197
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,224
I'd be happy if it were true.

198
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,395
Listen...

199
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,942
I want my sister to dance
in a fine kimono.

200
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,528
I need a good one for her.

201
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,741
- Yes, but...
- Mr Kimura...

202
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:58,122
Won't you make a beautiful one for her?
Pretend that it's for me?

203
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,126
Instead of asking a poor man like me,

204
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,963
ask your patron.

205
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,384
I don't have anyone like that.
If I did, I'd have him buy me

206
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,970
lots of clothes.

207
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,846
Hook a rich man, then.

208
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,308
I hate you. You want me to do that?

209
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,310
So that's it.

210
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:25,024
I was a fool.
I thought you meant what you said.

211
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,611
All right, if that's how you feel,

212
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,364
I'll find many patrons,

213
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,993
men much kinder than you.

214
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,496
I was joking. Tell me what you want.

215
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,207
Never mind. I don't want it any more.

216
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:47,880
If you really do like me,
I can do something about one kimono.

217
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,632
You're really stupid.

218
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,343
Open your eyes.

219
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:57,598
Can't you tell whether or not
a girl likes you?

220
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,894
I can't, not unless you let me know.

221
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,440
I really can't.

222
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,233
Hopeless!

223
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,371
What a pretty design. I'll choose this.

224
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:26,919
It costs 53 yen.
The best kimono material I brought today.

225
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,880
Undoubtedly.

226
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,383
I've been watching you.

227
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,055
You've got younger.
I almost didn't recognise you.

228
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,724
You and your jokes.

229
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:44,812
I went to Mr Furusawa's place
to bid in the auction.

230
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,274
I was told he "wasn't at home".

231
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:53,112
Is that why you're looking so young?

232
00:17:54,573 --> 00:18:01,079
I can always tell if it's the real thing
or just an affair.

233
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,998
You can't fool me.

234
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,376
- I guess you're right.
- Really?

235
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,754
- Ah, you're embarrassing me!
- Oh, you!

236
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:15,134
Where's the house
that Furusawa is staying at?

237
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,933
Be careful. It's dangerous.

238
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,478
- Who's there?
- It's Mr Jurakudo.

239
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:29,774
We talked about you.
He insisted on seeing you.

240
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,486
I haven't seen you for a long time.

241
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,240
Furusawa! Furusawa!

242
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,993
I've certainly missed you.

243
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,621
I've missed you.

244
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,375
He drank too much.

245
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,088
It's terrible, isn't it?

246
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:58,594
I went to the auction
at your store yesterday.

247
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,432
I couldn't help weeping.

248
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:10,398
All the scrolls, they were the ones I sold you.

249
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:17,488
I never thought I'd be buying
those scrolls back from you.

250
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:24,662
It's tragic. I cried in front of the others.

251
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,709
Can you understand how I felt?

252
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,836
Can you?

253
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,797
He's dead drunk, isn't he?

254
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,635
Dead drunk?
That's a mean thing to say, Furusawa.

255
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:47,977
You think I'm drunk
and just talking a lot of nonsense?

256
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,855
- I understand.
- Is that what you think?

257
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,025
Thanks for crying for me.

258
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,111
What an interesting man.

259
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,531
Who are you?

260
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,785
A beautiful princess.

261
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,872
Be careful.

262
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,208
- Look out.
- Who are you?

263
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,378
My younger sister. Please be good to her.

264
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,631
Your sister?

265
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,344
You have a beautiful sister like her?

266
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,226
Let's have a drink.

267
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,269
Pour for me, pretty princess.

268
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,317
Not you. If you poured,
the saké would lose its taste.

269
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,985
Do as you like.

270
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,492
Jurakudo, do me a favour.

271
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,576
What?

272
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,748
- Lend me some money.
- How much?

273
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,252
- 30 yen will do.
- That's too much.

274
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,297
- Make it 20.
- Don't be stingy.

275
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,509
How the world changes.

276
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:07,974
Furusawa, owner of Kyoto's
biggest cotton goods store,

277
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,979
asking a favour of the lowly Jurakudo

278
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,149
because he's in need of some pocket money.

279
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,944
Pitiful when one's luck changes.

280
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,530
What's that?

281
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,450
After selling me
imitation scrolls and chinaware.

282
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,288
I dare you to repeat that.

283
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,249
Making statements like that.

284
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,462
Are you saying I did such a thing?

285
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,508
That I sell phoney antiques?

286
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,218
Forget it.

287
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,053
It's pitiful.

288
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:51,642
After going only yesterday
to bid at the auction.

289
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,188
- I wept.
- I know that.

290
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,899
Those scrolls.

291
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,152
I understand. I was only joking.

292
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,613
It's only proper for you to understand.

293
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,201
I don't sell phoney antiques at my store.

294
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,662
- Understand?
- Yes.

295
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,666
Do you? If you do, then it's all right.

296
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,714
- You've had enough.
- Is this enough?

297
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,175
Wait a minute.

298
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,140
Look out! He's terribly drunk.

299
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,643
I'll see him home.

300
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,854
Where does he live?

301
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,023
- In Kiyomizu.
- I see.

302
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,318
Mr Jurakudo.

303
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,454
Driver, please go back to Shimokiya.

304
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,872
OK.

305
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,452
Are you awake now?

306
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,249
Who are you?

307
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,460
You were very drunk.

308
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,921
You made me come here.

309
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,340
I did?

310
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,761
Let me see. Who are you?

311
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,097
Omocha, Umekichi's sister.

312
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,310
She has a sister like you?

313
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,943
Why am I here? Is it just the two of us?

314
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,612
What are you saying?

315
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,034
I recall that I went to Umekichi's house.

316
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,832
Oh, yes, did I meet Furusawa there?

317
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,459
You did.

318
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,963
I certainly got drunk last night, didn't I?

319
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,052
Is this Shimokiya?

320
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,638
Have a drink?

321
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,725
What time is it now?

322
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,311
A little past 10:00 a.m..

323
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,480
Ten o'clock? This won't do.

324
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,284
Please wait.

325
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,953
- I want to talk to you.
- About what?

326
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:04,168
My sister wants to ask your advice
about something.

327
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,086
Pocket money? No!

328
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:11,342
What are your feelings towards my sister?

329
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,428
My feelings towards her?
Why do you ask that?

330
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,056
- Do you dislike her?
- What?

331
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,017
I see. Then it can't be helped.

332
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,234
Wait. No need to be hasty.

333
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,614
My sister has been telling me
all about you.

334
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,324
Is this flattery?

335
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,201
She says that you're very kind

336
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:42,039
and that a woman would be lucky
to have a patron like you.

337
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,751
- Is that true?
- Why would I lie?

338
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,255
- A drink?
- Thank you.

339
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:57,221
Your sister has Furusawa, doesn't she?

340
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,682
That's the point.

341
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,478
He was her patron once,
but that's all in the past.

342
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:09,233
A sense of obligation makes her help him.

343
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,487
But, to be honest,

344
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,615
my sister finds him troublesome now.

345
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,871
No wonder. Nothing but a parasite...

346
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,207
- Being down and out like that.
- That's right.

347
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,253
He's penniless. He'll drag her down.

348
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,089
Make her poor, too.

349
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,465
That's right.

350
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,426
Excuse me for making you wait.

351
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,428
Is there anything you'd like to order?

352
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,847
A lot of food.

353
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,140
Saké, too.

354
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,642
Of course, right away.

355
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,479
This is what my sister thinks.

356
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:52,401
If you say that you'll look after her,

357
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,822
Furusawa will naturally be forced to leave.

358
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,452
Please sympathise with her.

359
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,454
It's a bit awkward.

360
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,830
Why?

361
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:09,918
After all, I used to do business with him.

362
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,380
I don't think I could do it

363
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,634
unless she breaks up
with Furusawa first.

364
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,555
I'll lend a helping hand
if you'll provide money.

365
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,307
Money?

366
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:28,020
He doesn't even have train fare
to get home with.

367
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,396
How much?

368
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,318
Mere pocket money won't do.

369
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,654
- One hundred yen?
- That's perfect.

370
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,491
All right, for your sister's sake.

371
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,328
Isn't it for your sake rather than hers?

372
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,996
Don't say that.

373
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,171
- I'm home.
- Hi.

374
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,548
I'm so tired.

375
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,509
- You saw him home safely?
- Yeah.

376
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,220
- Thank you.
- He was so drunk.

377
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,390
- I had a hard time.
- I imagine you did.

378
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,101
Hungry? Care for noodles?

379
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,603
I've already eaten.

380
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,148
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

381
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,360
- Goes well with saké.
- I'll try some.

382
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,577
- Delicious.
- More saké?

383
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,087
More?

384
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,219
Empty your cup.

385
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,271
- Listen, Mr Furusawa.
- What?

386
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:56,859
You may not like what I'm about to say.
Don't get angry.

387
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,820
What is it?

388
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,115
You may have guessed already.

389
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:09,872
You probably know,
but you staying here makes it hard for us.

390
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,957
I realise that.

391
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,917
Expenses are mounting up.

392
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,588
The geisha business isn't very profitable.

393
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,089
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,925
We can barely make a living.

395
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,764
Our world is like a goldfish bowl.

396
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,976
Just your being here
has caused a lot of gossip.

397
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,144
I suppose so.

398
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:35,731
We're looking after you
out of love and loyalty.

399
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,401
Other people don't see it that way.

400
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,031
My sister doesn't say anything.

401
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,953
But you can imagine how it is.
I'm really sorry.

402
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,248
I've raised some money.

403
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,585
Here's 50 yen. Use it to return home.

404
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,961
You're kind.

405
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,678
I hope you'll take it the right way.

406
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,013
I'll leave.

407
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:14,228
You've had a hard time,
so you're very understanding.

408
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,244
My best regards to Umekichi.

409
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,829
Of course.

410
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,998
Goodbye, then.

411
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,500
Keep well.

412
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,499
Master! Master!

413
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,502
Who is it?

414
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,175
Sadakichi!
I haven't seen you for a long time.

415
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,555
- How's business?
- Where have you been?

416
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,725
We were all worried.

417
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:40,230
Your wife was angry,
she returned to the country. And you?

418
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:44,526
I was staying with a friend.
Got kicked out.

419
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,737
Then go and join your wife.

420
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,866
Forget it. Let's meet tonight.

421
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,993
Go for a walk, then go to a bar.

422
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,039
I'll accompany you.
Anyway, please come to my house...

423
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,582
Never mind about that.

424
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,488
I'm back.

425
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,783
Where is Mr Furusawa?

426
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,371
Not here any more.

427
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,207
Not here? What happened?

428
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:45,671
It was strange. He hurried out
as if he remembered something.

429
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,464
Went away?

430
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,635
I kept silent.

431
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,805
Didn't ask you that.

432
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,598
Very puzzling.

433
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,148
How's this?

434
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:13,323
Even an expert couldn't tell it
from the real thing.

435
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,992
It's extraordinary.

436
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,327
What's the asking price?

437
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,832
There's no question that it's outstanding.

438
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,334
Well,

439
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,047
shall we say 170 yen?

440
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,887
Excuse me.

441
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,765
Come and sit here.

442
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,142
Thank you.

443
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,074
My mistake. I meant 270 yen.

444
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,369
That's much too high.

445
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,538
I can't reduce the price.

446
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:05,709
You don't want it?
I'll sell it to someone else.

447
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,961
I'll take it.

448
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,504
You will?

449
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,471
Many thanks.

450
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,768
Thank you very much.

451
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,606
- Come here.
- Thank you.

452
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,737
How did it go?

453
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,909
Much easier than expected,
almost embarrassingly so.

454
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,078
Somewhat disappointing.

455
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,622
Naughty girl. How's Umekichi?

456
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:48,001
Happily looking forward to living with you.

457
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,711
Really?

458
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,171
But listen.

459
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,591
You mustn't talk about Furusawa.

460
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,302
Better to not complicate things.

461
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:02,557
And you should not say
that you know she loves you.

462
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,643
That's unwise.

463
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:08,313
I understand. I won't bungle things.

464
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,149
Can I meet her right away?

465
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,859
Do it cleverly.

466
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,866
Add it up yourself.

467
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,371
Do you think you can fool me like this?

468
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:31,461
I thought there was something strange
about you lately.

469
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:36,174
You're not good at cheating.

470
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,262
You'll end up in a bad way.

471
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,350
Why did you need so much money?
Come on, tell me.

472
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,521
You can't tell me?

473
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,358
Then...

474
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,736
let me tell you how I see it.

475
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,158
Some geisha wheedled you
into making her a kimono.

476
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,244
Am I right?

477
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,957
Don't be the kind of man
who buys a woman's love.

478
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,087
When I was young, girls brought me gifts.

479
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:22,846
That girl that you love can't be very good.

480
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:29,644
If she's the kind that you can marry,
I'll act as the go-between.

481
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,647
So, tell me who she is.

482
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,357
I'll go and take a look.

483
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,749
Omocha! Omocha!

484
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,213
Omocha! Something terrible has happened.

485
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,631
What is it?

486
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,841
I've been found out.

487
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,220
What are you talking about?

488
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,230
I may be fired.

489
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,606
Is that so?

490
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,860
If my employer comes, cover for me.

491
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,323
Don't expect me to get you out of trouble.

492
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,617
Help me.

493
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,748
My employer said that if you're willing,
he'd help us get married.

494
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,251
- Me, to you?
- Of course!

495
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,169
How silly!

496
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,547
Please don't mess things up.

497
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,926
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

498
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,099
- Who are you?
- I own the Marubishi.

499
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,393
Thank you for buying from us.

500
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,770
So you're the one. I see.

501
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,814
You're Omocha?

502
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,109
Yes, I am. What can I do for you?

503
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,944
Let's talk a bit.

504
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,656
All right. Why don't you come up?

505
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,325
Thank you.

506
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,290
- Please...
- Please, don't bother.

507
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,233
I wanted to talk to you about Kimura.

508
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,157
He says he made a kimono for Umekichi.
Is that true?

509
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,827
Oh, that? I received it some time ago.

510
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,496
Admitting it so glibly?

511
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:59,794
You live in geisha quarters.
Surely you ought to know

512
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:04,966
whether a mere clerk is able
to give away kimono material

513
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,801
that costs over 50 yen.

514
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:07,886
I wouldn't know.

515
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:13,266
I won't let you say that.
You knew and yet you...

516
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,893
Don't be silly.

517
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,108
I asked Kimura whether it was OK,

518
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,362
whether it would get him into trouble.

519
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,783
He said not to worry.
That's why I accepted the kimono.

520
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:35,997
He's been with me since he was a small boy.
I know him well.

521
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,708
He's honest, almost to a fault.

522
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,379
Is that so? Honest, is he?

523
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,384
A man who would try
to take advantage of a girl

524
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,386
by offering her a kimono?

525
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,263
Is that what he did?

526
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,016
It's partly my fault, too.

527
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:01,231
If I was a popular geisha,
I wouldn't have accepted it.

528
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,487
I don't have a patron.
It's hard to buy even one kimono.

529
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,698
That's why when he offered it...

530
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,205
A pretty girl and not popular?

531
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,916
It happens to be the truth.

532
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,253
I'd like to have a patron.

533
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,464
No one's willing to take care of me.

534
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,718
That's the men's fault, not yours.

535
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:35,140
You're skilled in the art of flattery.
I wish it were true.

536
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,599
It is.

537
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,105
Talking with you, I forgot to offer tea.

538
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,107
No, no, don't bother.

539
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,657
If someone would take care of a girl like me,

540
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,827
I'd love him with all my heart.

541
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,914
Please come over here. Have a drink.

542
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:04,294
It's better than tea. No one else is here.

543
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,379
Come over here.

544
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,133
All right, I will, if you don't mind.

545
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,351
- Please.
- Well, thanks.

546
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,073
Then you and your sister live here together?

547
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,744
Yes, the two of us work very hard.

548
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,162
It's no use.

549
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:45,710
All the more reason not to get involved
with a penniless clerk like him.

550
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,588
But I don't know anyone else.

551
00:41:54,011 --> 00:42:00,642
You must know many fine men.
Find a patron for me.

552
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,437
I don't know a single man who'd qualify.

553
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,689
That can't be.

554
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,069
Still, the young men aren't dependable.

555
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,409
They don't listen
when we try to talk seriously.

556
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:23,206
Young men are no good,
they haven't suffered.

557
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,582
Very true.

558
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:29,546
A man like you knows
the bitter and the sweet.

559
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,675
I'd like to tell you about myself.

560
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,427
I don't mind listening.

561
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,306
I'm glad. I'm really glad.

562
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:48,439
If only I could have someone like you
to take care of me, I'd be delighted.

563
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:52,110
Sweet words to make an old man happy?

564
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,571
I really mean it.

565
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,908
I choose you as my patron.

566
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,743
You don't mind?

567
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,704
Well...

568
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,957
- Take off your haori.
- Yes, but...

569
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,551
No urgent business today?

570
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,469
Nothing special.

571
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,767
Then make yourself comfortable.

572
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:30,565
- This seems a bit too good to be true.
- Don't say that.

573
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,995
- The boss?
- Not yet.

574
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,163
Really?

575
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,444
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

576
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,237
Kimura,

577
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:19,989
come.

578
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,325
- Welcome.
- Welcome back!

579
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,535
- Welcome!
- Welcome back.

580
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,048
She won't do.

581
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,802
There are plenty of geisha like her.

582
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,098
- Better find someone else.
- I'm sorry.

583
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,518
I'll let you off this time.

584
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,979
Behave better from now on.

585
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,526
I'll make the rounds of
the geisha quarters for a while,

586
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,486
all right?

587
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,489
Stay away from that girl.

588
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,869
I'm thinking of your future when I say this.

589
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,541
If I find you going near her, you'll regret it.

590
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,626
Don't forget.

591
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,130
Sorry. I'll be most careful. I'm very sorry.

592
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:24,679
You haven't been fooled by a little flattery?

593
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,598
Nonsense. Why do you say that?

594
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,561
There's no telling what you'll do.

595
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,954
Take a look at this, sister.

596
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,249
Doesn't it look nice on me?

597
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,587
Just do things right.

598
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,593
Have everything you want. Live in luxury.

599
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,769
Why can't you be more practical?

600
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,605
Working hard, growing older.

601
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,483
What about Mr Jurakudo?

602
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,320
He wants a definite answer today.

603
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,544
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

604
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,716
Well...

605
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,176
Mr Jurakudo.

606
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,721
What's the situation?

607
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,559
Is it OK?

608
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,730
She's been eagerly awaiting you.
Come on up.

609
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,200
- Hello.
- Welcome.

610
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,418
Now's the time, sister.

611
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,003
Let her decide.

612
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,174
Have some tea.

613
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,261
Thank you.

614
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,523
- Have you thought it over?
- Well...

615
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:48,030
Only one way out of this

616
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,033
That is to die

617
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,495
That would bring an end
to lamentation and grief

618
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,541
While knowing that

619
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:10,469
It would never be condoned

620
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:15,516
Hello, Mr Furusawa. How is everything?

621
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,810
Thanks. The same as usual.

622
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,690
Aren't you staying with Umekichi?

623
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,193
No, I'm staying here
at the home of my former clerk.

624
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:32,408
Is that so? I'm thinking of paying a visit.

625
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,244
Any message I can take?

626
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,704
To Umekichi?

627
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,087
I guess not.

628
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,632
No message? Excuse me, then.

629
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,662
- Hello.
- Hello.

630
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,085
You haven't been coming around.

631
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:30,591
No, my employer
is making the rounds now.

632
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,470
- I've been told to stay away.
- Oh, really?

633
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,643
Welcome.

634
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,190
Umekichi, what happened?

635
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:50,528
Was there a quarrel?
I just met Mr Furusawa.

636
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,989
What? Mr Furusawa?

637
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,242
Where?

638
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,787
- You didn't know?
- No!

639
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,581
- In Yasakashita.
- Is that so?

640
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,751
At the home of his former clerk.

641
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,339
He was reciting from a drama as usual.

642
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,508
- Look here.
- And then?

643
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:17,013
As I watched him, I began to feel sad.

644
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:22,018
I recalled his extravagant days.

645
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,645
It made me wonder if this is how life is.

646
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,190
Umekichi! What's wrong?

647
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,824
What's troubling you?

648
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,743
What are you doing?

649
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,495
Please don't stop me.

650
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,459
I don't understand.

651
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,733
What's good today?

652
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,569
The menu's in a foreign language.

653
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,196
You can order.

654
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,169
What is it?

655
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,754
I forgot my wallet.

656
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,216
That's very careless.

657
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,803
Omocha?

658
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,104
What are you doing here?

659
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:53,734
You fool! Didn't I warn you?

660
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,070
Go home!

661
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,494
What about you, boss? You scolded me.

662
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,039
What's going on here anyway?

663
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,459
How dare you talk that way?

664
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:16,632
All right, I'm firing you. Get out.
Leave the store.

665
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:22,680
You'd better not be there
when I get back. Stupid!

666
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,642
Omocha, tell me. What is he to you?

667
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,311
- My patron.
- What?

668
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,234
You can say that so brazenly
in front of me?

669
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,028
- You vixen!
- Vixen? Fine.

670
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:42,658
Can a geisha do business
by always telling the truth?

671
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,994
- Sometimes I tell a fib.
- What?

672
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,620
What are you doing?

673
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:51,917
So what? You're acting like my lover
after giving me one kimono.

674
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,169
What?

675
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,005
You'd better watch your step.

676
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,008
Try that again and you'll be arrested.

677
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,050
Right!

678
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,347
Another warning:
Don't forget about today.

679
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,517
- Boss.
- What?

680
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,394
You too, Omocha.

681
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,605
Stop grumbling. Get out!

682
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:18,277
I will. Remember, Omocha, I'm a man.

683
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,947
- Oh, I won't forget. Such a fine man.
- Get out.

684
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,957
How stupid can a fellow be?

685
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,545
Well, well.

686
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:43,052
What made you leave me and go away?

687
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,846
Don't you realise how I feel?

688
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,726
What are you saying?
Do I appear to be so heartless?

689
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:55,064
I was told you didn't want me around.

690
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,899
Who said that?

691
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,443
- Omocha did.
- Omocha?

692
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,906
Then I was right.

693
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,078
I had a feeling that's how things were.

694
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,290
Why did she have to do that?

695
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:21,257
Even if she did,
why did you leave without telling me?

696
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:24,176
I thought I was unwanted.

697
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,096
If I didn't want you, would I suffer so?

698
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,599
You saying that makes me happy.

699
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,107
But does Omocha dislike me that much?

700
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,112
How about moving in here with me?

701
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,240
If you don't mind, I will.

702
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:51,078
I don't want to stay with a sister
who acts that way.

703
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,663
It's comfortable here.

704
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,213
We'll be alone.

705
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,464
I'm so happy.

706
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,845
You say that, but won't you go away
and leave me again?

707
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:12,349
Of course not.
How could I go and leave you?

708
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,934
Is that true?

709
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,982
I'd like to borrow your phone.

710
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,483
- What's up?
- Your phone.

711
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,860
- OK.
- Please.

712
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,499
Who? Kimura?

713
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,879
What did you say? Don't tell silly lies.

714
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,173
I'm not lying. It happens to be true.

715
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:49,887
You've been very kind to me.

716
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,181
How did it happen?

717
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,144
- Is that really true?
- The truth.

718
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:02,524
I saw your husband at a nice place in Gion.

719
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,569
That's why I'm being fired.

720
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,490
A nice place in Gion? Where?

721
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,911
Omocha's house, where I made
that mistake. That's right.

722
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,955
Your husband is a proud patron.

723
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,585
I can't return to the store.

724
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:27,299
So, goodbye.
Give my regards to your husband.

725
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,059
Welcome back!

726
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,189
Has Kimura returned?

727
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,690
Not yet.

728
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,236
He hasn't?

729
00:56:48,571 --> 00:57:00,916
- I'm back.
- Welcome.

730
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,672
I brought you something tasty from Gion.

731
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:12,886
Busy, busy. So much business to attend to.

732
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,265
No time to rest.

733
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,772
What's the matter? Not feeling well?

734
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:27,276
- Don't come near me.
- Why?

735
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,778
- Otake!
- Yes?

736
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,156
- Is the bath ready?
- Shortly.

737
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,950
Give this rubbish to the dog.

738
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,618
What's going on?

739
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,039
Stop this nonsense, you imbecile.

740
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,042
Yes, I'm an imbecile.

741
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,713
What are you so angry about?

742
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:53,302
Don't take me for a fool.
Where were you until now? Tell me.

743
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,554
With a customer.

744
00:57:56,055 --> 00:58:00,017
Are you telling me the truth?

745
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,145
That's enough of your grumbling.

746
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:10,319
Still fooling around at your age?

747
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:33,800
Welcome home.
Jurakudo was glad, wasn't he?

748
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,511
I'm moving out.

749
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,721
For what reason?

750
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:40,349
Mr Furusawa told me everything.

751
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,268
You met Furusawa somewhere?

752
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,522
I'll send for my things later.

753
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,192
Sister!

754
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,363
Sister, wait!

755
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,379
What a foolish sister.

756
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,086
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

757
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,590
Is Omocha in?

758
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,924
Yes. What is it?

759
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,844
Mr Kudo sent the car for you.

760
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:03,515
Mr Kudo did?
In that case, wait one moment.

761
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:42,596
How's business, Omocha?
Drive somewhere?

762
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,266
What? Don't try to act familiar with me.

763
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:48,185
Is that so?

764
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,983
I know about you.

765
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,655
Is that the kimono you got from a clerk?

766
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,906
Stop joking!

767
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,993
A beautiful face, but no wealthy patron.

768
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:09,581
Still have to hustle. I feel sorry for you.

769
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:16,213
How dare you? You're being impudent.
Where is Mr Kudo?

770
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,424
Mr Kudo? Forget him.

771
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,843
A stingy patron like him is no good.

772
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,681
I'll find you a rake with a lot of money.

773
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,893
Prefer a younger man? How about me?

774
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,521
I could show you a good time.

775
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,357
I'm not that kind of woman!

776
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:41,196
Nonsense. No use talking big.
You'll do anything for money.

777
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,408
Come with me. Let's make love.

778
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,662
Fool! How dare you say
such a thing to me?

779
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,040
It's been a long time.

780
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,877
Now here we are.

781
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,381
I intend to make you listen
to all my grievances tonight.

782
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:02,342
- Mr Kimura.
- I'm a bitter man.

783
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,011
You'll get what you deserve.

784
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,889
- Let me out!
- You stay here.

785
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,191
I said let me out!

786
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,903
Don't be afraid. Just come with me.

787
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,072
Let me out! Let me out!

788
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,999
It's terrible. Your sister is badly hurt.

789
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,126
- Omocha?
- Omocha?

790
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,919
I just heard.

791
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,756
Umekichi, you'd better go right away.

792
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,883
What happened?

793
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:46,511
No use worrying about it here.
Go and see her.

794
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,597
Hurry.

795
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,932
I'll go, then.

796
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:02,944
If you need anything, let me know at once.

797
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,907
- Umekichi.
- Mother.

798
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,617
What happened?

799
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,455
I don't know if it was out of spite.
She was flung out of a car.

800
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,999
Is it bad?

801
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:19,669
I'm hoping she won't become crippled.

802
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,129
Oh, no...

803
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,718
- Where is she?
- Being treated.

804
01:03:31,098 --> 01:03:32,432
Will she survive?

805
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,559
Let's hope so.

806
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:53,161
Omocha, what happened to you?

807
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,044
Are you in pain?

808
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,546
Now do you see?

809
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:07,592
See what happens with your attitude
of belittling men.

810
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,803
It led to this terrible thing.

811
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:14,683
I won't back down.
I won't be defeated by men.

812
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:20,522
He couldn't get his way with me.

813
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:25,652
So he did this cowardly thing.

814
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,655
I'll make him sorry for it.

815
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,032
Don't talk like that.

816
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:37,163
Let this be a lesson
not to trample on people's feelings.

817
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,418
You could have avoided this
by taking my advice.

818
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,547
Doing as you do?

819
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:51,344
It simply means being defeated by men.
I'll never accept that.

820
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,308
It's stupid! Who wants to lose to men?

821
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,310
Don't get so upset.

822
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,563
You mustn't get excited just now.

823
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:05,358
Be quiet for a while.

824
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,550
Do you mind?

825
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:41,686
I'll go and get my things.
Will you stay until I return?

826
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,022
Hurry back.

827
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,751
Did he go out?

828
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:09,297
Mr Furusawa?
A telegram came from his wife.

829
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,757
A telegram?

830
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,970
He and my husband left
for Mrs Furusawa's place.

831
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,346
Mrs Furusawa's?

832
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:21,935
Mr Furusawa is becoming the manager
of a rayon factory there.

833
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,479
- Is that so?
- Yes.

834
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,316
Did he leave me any messages?

835
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,652
Not in writing.

836
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:37,367
He said to tell you that he's unreliable,
that you should find a good patron.

837
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:40,912
- How could he say that?
- Strange.

838
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,837
I feel a bit cold, sister.

839
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:52,465
Can you put another blanket on me?

840
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,569
What's the matter? Why are you crying?

841
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:23,455
What's wrong?
Has something tragic happened?

842
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:29,377
Mr Furusawa left suddenly for the country

843
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,297
without telling me he was going.

844
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:39,387
It's exactly as I said.

845
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,266
They think nothing of abandoning us
when it suits them.

846
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:49,314
I don't mind. It's all right with me.

847
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,109
I've done all I can.

848
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,489
I'm sure it made Mr Furusawa happy.

849
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:03,578
I can face the world
with my head held high.

850
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,040
Has it helped you in a practical way?

851
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:12,420
You can face the world proudly,
but what has it done for you?

852
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:18,635
Mr Furusawa may be happy,
but what about you?

853
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,138
Are you better off now?

854
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:29,104
You meekly did as you were told.
And what did you gain by it? Nothing.

855
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,985
If we're sharp in business, we're criticised.

856
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:41,908
What are we to do?
What do they want us to do?

857
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,832
Why must we suffer so?

858
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:54,712
Why are there such things as geisha
in this world?

859
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,423
Why must they exist?

860
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:01,136
It's wrong, entirely wrong.

861
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:07,016
I wish...
I wish that they never existed.

862
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,905
THE END

863
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,109
