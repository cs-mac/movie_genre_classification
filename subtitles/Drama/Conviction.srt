should put my big mouth to good use

00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,900
that Kenny said
he had killed Mrs. Brow?

322
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,917
I was afraid of him.
I thought he'd kill me, too.

323
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,650
(WHISPERS)
What is she doing to him?

324
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:48,281
I show you, Ms. Marsh, what's
marked as Exhibit number 64,

325
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,922
and I would ask if you
could identify that.

326
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,301
It's the same knife
Kenny carried.

327
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,269
And when Kenneth Waters
was brought in as a suspect,

328
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:04,604
did he have an alibi for the period
between midnight and 9:00 a.m.

329
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,108
On February 21 st?

330
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,611
He claimed that he was working
as a cook at the Park Diner.

331
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,180
And what did you discover when
you checked out his alibi?

332
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,773
We confirmed that he was
at work until 5:00 a.m.,

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,085
but beyond that, there were no
witnesses who saw when he left.

334
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,252
His time cards
were never found.

335
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,421
KATSAS: The head and chest were struck
with a ceramic lamp and a metal toaster,

336
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,128
and there were 30 stab wounds.
Six to the head and neck,

337
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:36,664
three to the back, one to the
abdomen and 14 to the chest.

338
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,542
Five of them
penetrated to the heart,

339
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,641
and one time it went through the
front and almost came out the back.

340
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,480
HIGGINS: There was an enormous amount
of blood, mostly from the victim,

341
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,882
but some from the perpetrator.

342
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,045
And what, if anything,
did you determine

343
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,123
With respect to the blood
of Katharina Brow?

344
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,958
Katharina Brow would be
identified as blood group B.

345
00:21:56,215 --> 00:22:01,221
And with respect to
Exhibits SSA through F,

346
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,197
did you examine those items
from the murder scene

347
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,395
and determine the blood
group present on each?

348
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,904
Yes. The blood on each of those
items was from blood group O.

349
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,802
And did you have occasion
to test a sample

350
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,845
from the defendant, Kenneth Waters?

351
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,813
Yes. His sample is
from blood group O.

352
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,374
FAHEY: And what was
your relationship

353
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,579
with Mr. Waters after you
met the summer of 1980?

354
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,420
ROSEANNA: Mmm...

355
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,585
I guess you could say we were lovers
for a while, about six months.

356
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:35,991
FAHEY: On those occasions when you
did some drinking with Mr. Waters,

357
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,761
do you recall anything he said to you?
(MOUTHING)

358
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,898
He told me he got picked
up for a murder in Ayer

359
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,771
and that they couldn't pin it on
him, and he laughed about ii.

360
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,235
FAHEY: Sometime after
the summer of 1980,

361
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:53,010
did you have another conversation with Mr.
Waters about this murder?

362
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,578
YES.

363
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,849
Um...

364
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:02,887
He told me he stabbed her and
he took her money and jewellery

365
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,558
Did he tell you anything else?

366
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:11,464
He called her an old German bitch,
a fucking old German bitch.

367
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,097
After Kenneth Waters supposedly
told you, "I killed her,"

368
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,642
did you terminate seeing him?

369
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,534
No. So you believed
him to be a murderer,

370
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,309
but you continued to be
romantically involved?

371
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,715
Yeah. Until he bashed
my teeth in.

372
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,883
FAHEY: You have nine children by seven
different fathers, is that correct?

373
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,216
Objection!

374
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,261
Sustained.

375
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,923
Didn't the state, in fact,
declare you an unfit mother

376
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,431
and take your children
away from you?

377
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,660
Objection!
Irrelevant.

378
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,831
Sustained.
Watch yourself, Ms. Fahey.

379
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,906
Wasn't Kenny sent
to training school

380
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,838
for breaking into
K. Brow's home?

381
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,771
No! That wasn't...
And didn't your son

382
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,175
regularly break into houses
in the neighbourhood?

383
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,937
(STAMMERING) I never condoned that
type of behaviour from my children...

384
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,347
Just answer the
question, please.

385
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,912
Yes.

386
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,370
BETTY: I hope
our place is as nice.

387
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,534
KENNY: I'm not gonna
live in no trailer.

388
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,444
I'm gonna have a mansion
with 100 rooms.

389
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,677
(CHUCKLES) And 10 refrigerators
filled with candy.

390
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,717
And our own private lake.

391
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,119
Lake Betty Anne and Kenny.

392
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,953
Lake Kenny and Betty Anne.

393
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,984
I Said it first.

394
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,726
Well, I'm older.

395
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,491
No, stop it!

396
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:48,327
Where's my candy?

397
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,160
Calm down, Mrs. Brow.
We'll take care of it.

398
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,326
Lee, around back.

399
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,000
(BANGING ON DOOR)

400
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,668
Open up in there.
Police.

401
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,577
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.

402
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,073
KENNY: Go, go, go, go.

403
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,484
God damn it! What did I tell
you kids about trespassing?

404
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,922
Kenny, get over here. Stand right there.
Betty Anne, come on. Ow!

405
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,025
Come here, Betty Anne, come here.
(BETTY SHRIEKS)

406
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,726
Get over here.

407
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,362
Hey, fat ass, your
mother's a dirty whore.

408
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,666
Come here. Ow!

409
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,733
You don't touch my sister.
Don't you touch my sister.

410
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,004
Don't touch her.

411

OFFICER:
Take him to the ground.

412
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,703
Get down.

413
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,281
(GRUNTING)

414
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:40,906
Kenny!

415
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,185
Go, run.
Run, Betty Anne. Run!

416
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,081
BETTY:
We were just kids.

417
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,723
We'd play in people's houses and
pretend we had a normal life.

418
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,353
I don't know what
you're talking about.

419
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,897
You had a perfectly
normal life.

420
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,956
Yeah. Eight foster homes.
Perfectly normal.

421
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,290
There, baby.

422
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,767
ELIZABETH: The only reason
they took you away from me

423
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,235
is because l worked too much.

424
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,872
I had no life
except for you kids.

425
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,465
We know, Mother.
You were practically a nun.

426
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,606
But Kenny, he'd be
like a wild animal.

427
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,583
I'm not saying he was born
bad, but he had that temper.

428
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,778
I was always afraid
he might kill somebody.

429
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,886
Don't you ever say that
to me or anyone else!

430
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,754
Don't you even think ii,
you understand me?

431
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,454
I mean, what kind of mother
would say something like that?

432
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:33,301
ELIZABETH: They're my babies!
They can't do this!

433
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,664
GRANDPA:
They bloody well can.

434
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,463
ELIZABETH: Why do they
have to separate them?

435
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,839
Why can't they go
to one foster home?

436
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,256
Shh!

437
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,209
BOISSEAU: I hate
to split them up.

438

You are gonna
come with me, honey.

00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,786
No, I don't want to.

442
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,220
Come on, fellow, now.

443
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,395
Stop! No!
Let go of him!

444
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,160
Betty, stop, stop. Let him go.
You gotta let him go.

Please, no!

close, motherfucker!

00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:18,131
Settle down! I said
you gotta settle down!

478
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,002
You want some of this shit?

479
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,732

BETTY: Did you tell
Mr. Peters it was urgent?

484
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,585
I haven't heard
from Kenny in two weeks.

485
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,846
RICK: Not in your
mouth, buddy.

486
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,185
BETTY: He's called me every
Sunday for the past three years.

Just find my brother.

Damn it, where is he?

492
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,464
Something's wrong, I know it.

493
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,594
We should have heard
from Kenny by now.

494
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,532
You gotta make peace with this.

495
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,171
Make peace?

496
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,608
We got a family here.
This is us now.

497

Babe, Kenny's in prison for the
rest of his life. Accept it.

It's Harvey Peters.

Kenny since we lost the appeal.

You got nothing to worry about.

What do you mean?
What happened?

504
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,192
Your brother's in
isolation, so no calls...

505
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,857
Why is he in isolation?

506
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,065
He tried to kill himself

Promise me you'll never do this again.

There's nothing left.
It's over.

There's still
the Supreme Court.

fucking hear this case. I'm fucked.

You can't give up.

522
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,735
We'll find somebody else.
I'll take out a loan.

523
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,103
We'll get a top
lawyer this time.

There is no one else.

I thought maybe I could
get a degree, finally.

Why?

550

I just thought, maybe...
I don't know.

Maybe I could eventually
apply to law school.

You're not doing this.
You're not doing this.

Enough.

555
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,608
So, this is what I'm gonna do and...
Don't laugh, all right?

556
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,115
I'm gonna start by
trying to get a BA

557
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,243
after I finally take
the stupid GED test,

558
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,915
and after that,
if I even get that far,

559
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:42,481
and there's no guarantee
I'll even get in,

560
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,821
I'll apply to law school.

561
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,727
But it is gonna take along time,
Kenny, a really long time,

562
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:53,326
and, I mean,
I might be 80 years old

563
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:54,597
before I finally
become a lawyer,

564
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,004
and even then, I still don't know
if I'm gonna find the answers.

565
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,772
But you just have
to promise me,

you just have to,

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,344
that you will never try to
Kill yourself ever again,

whether Ms. Cooper...

I just didn't remember
it was this weekend.

I know, honey.
We'll go another weekend, okay?

00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,001
I know.

595
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,779
KENNY: I found this
book in the library.

596
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,914
It says that women hardly ever shoot
themselves when they commit suicide.

597
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,456
So Romeo Collad's
screwing Mrs. Brow, right?

00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,460
His wife puts a bullet
in her head. You follow?

Yeah.

600
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,224
What if we can prove
he shot her?

00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,061
How we gonna do that?

602
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,571
I don't know,
we'll investigate.

603
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,904
And then they'd take him more seriously
as a suspect in the Brow case., .

604
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,976
But Romeo Collad's dead, so...

605
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,146
(SIGHING)
So... So, what?

606
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,715
It could still be enough
to re-open the case.

607
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:22,311
We just gotta find a precedent.
Ask your Evidence teacher.

608
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:28,257
I really can't right now.
I got a ton of work and...

What's going on?

00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,422

with the boys? No.

Look, I'm...
Just forget it!

614
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,966
Did they strip Search you?

615
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,095
No.

616
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,831
Betty, it's me.
Now, come on, stop.

617
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,181
I'm on probation at school.

618
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,447
Probation? What do you mean?
I'm the one in jail.

619
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,078
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

620
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,686
It means that if I don't
improve, I'm out,

621
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,918
But you're doing... You're doing so...
You're doing great.

622
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:13,036
No, I'm not. I've had late papers
and I flunked my Torts exam.

623
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,834
They can't do that to you.

624
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,271
You're the smartest person
in the whole goddamn school.

625
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,141
Fuck that! I'm gonna write a letter
to those scum-bag teachers...

626
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,645
Yeah, and make sure you call
them scum-bags in the letter.

627
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,681
Fuck them! You should
at least get extra credit

628
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,215
for working on
a real fucking case.

629
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,875
They don't care about that.

630
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,812
Look, don't worry
about this, okay?

631
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,947
I'm gonna take care of it.

632
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,618
Okay?

633
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,894
Okay, okay.
Hey, don't cry, honey.

You're worth a thousand
of them preppy shitheads.

Don't cry, okay?

00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,527

You guys have a nice weekend?

00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,094
Yeah.
BETTY: Yeah?

642
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,264
Get any homework done?
A little.

BETTY: Yeah?

Okay, what's going on?

645
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,106
Hmm?

646
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,405
Come on, talk.
What happened?

647
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:36,777
We were thinking, you know, since
you've been so busy and all...

648
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:42,215
We were thinking that maybe
we wanna live with Dad.

649
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,520
That son of a bitch!
He put you up to this?

00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,753
No.

651
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,953
Did he?

652
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,221
No.

653
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:56,903
I need a guy around,
you know? For guy things.

654
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,978
You feel the same way?

655
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:06,980

I love you. I love you so much.
I love you, too, Mom.

If you keep missing classes, you will fail.

695
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,090
leave all my
worldly possessions

00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,496
to my sister,
Betty Anne Waters.

697

Also, most important, I'm giving her
full authority on any decisions

698
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,999
concerning my daughter
Mandy Marsh's well-being.

SCOTT: So, two of us
will be defense attorneys,

700
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,515
two will be the prosecutors.

701
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:34,819
Thanks for dropping by, Waters.

00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,124
Nice ironing job.

703
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,184
SCOTT: And then we need a
defendant, and a paralegal.

704
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,161
I nominate Betty Anne
to be the defendant.

705
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,789
What's my alleged crime?

706
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:44,856
Uh... Rape.

707
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:49,035
Oh. Gee, thanks.
What case did they assign us?

708
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,371
You'd know that if you
actually came to class.

709
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,630
Shut the fuck up.

Sewell v. State, 1992.

711
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,646
Sewell had already served 10
years in prison for rape,

712
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,478
and then he sued the state for the
right to DNA test the rape kit.

713
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:03,978
DNA test?

714
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,145
Yeah, the semen in the rape kit wasn't his.
The DNA didn't match.

715
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:09,889
And he won?

716
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,382
YES.

717
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,294
Yeah, look. "Advances in technology
may yield protection for exculpation

previously existed."

wants to be the paralegal?

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
BETTY: Abra.

721
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,783
It's the blood.
This is the key.

722
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,385
What?
There was so much blood.

723
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,682
Look, I'm gonna get Kenny out.

724
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,279
There were no DNA tests then.

725
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,855
They only knew that the murderer
was type O and so is Kenny.

726
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,522
But now, if we can DNA test the
murderers blood and Kenny's,

727
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,621
it'll prove Kenny's innocent,
just like in the rape case.

728
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,787
Betty.

729

I'm sorry, Don.

like this.

blood evidence still exists?

00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,365
'Cause we're gonna find it.

Barry Scheck.

737
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:40,306
This is what he does. Look, he has
this lnnocence Project in New York.

738
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,942
And you're just gonna call him up
and he's gonna take your case?

739
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,075
Yes!

740
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,143
Are we both gonna sleep
with him or just you?

741
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,952
Abra, God. Look.

742
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,257
Dear Mr. Scheck, I would greatly
appreciate any assistance

743
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,092
you and the lnnocence
Project can provide

744
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,961
in helping me free
my brother, Kenny,

745
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,897
From a life-without-parole sentence.

746
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:05,096
In 1983, Kenny was convicted in
Massachusetts of first-degree murder

747
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,268
with extreme atrocity
and armed robbery.

748
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,507
I have done everything in my
power for the last 16 years

00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,948
to prepare myself to prove
my brother's innocence.

You good?

751
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,949
I can't find it.
I can't find my ID.

remember a single thing.

764
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:53,978
BETTY: Mr. Scheck,

765
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:57,026
the day that my brother was
unjustly convicted of this crime,

766
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,890
changed not only
his life, but mine.

767
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:08,202
HUY: Dear Ms. Waters, I've enclosed
an application for your brother Kenny

768
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,363
to complete and return
to our office.

769
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,240
I must stress that
we only accept cases

770
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,312
where DNA evidence
can exonerate the accused.

771
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,980
It will be vital for us to determine
if any such evidence still exists.

772
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:25,579
Without DNA evidence, it will be
impossible for us to proceed.

773
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:30,189
The lnnocence Project has a
backlog of several hundred cases,

774
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,894
so I must caution that it
will be at least 18 months

775
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,520
before we can begin to
evaluate your brother's case.

776
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:41,599
Ii however, you pass the Bar exam
and become your brother's attorney,

777
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,495
you yourself can begin looking for
the DNA evidence immediately.

778
00:47:46,731 --> 00:47:48,369
If you manage to find ft,

779
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,879
Mr. Scheck may agree to act
as consulting attorney,

780
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,282
in which case
we can work together

781
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,283
towards exonerating
your brother.

782
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,292

Didn't you say that?

787
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,603
Open it.
Are you sure?

788
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,403
Don't look at it.

Don't look!

790
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,711
I'm not.

791
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:36,883
Thank you, God.

792
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,551
Did you hear what I said?

793
00:48:42,787 --> 00:48:43,788
Kenny?

794
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:48,492
(WHOOPS) Yeahs
We did its We did in

795
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:51,933
My baby sister!

796
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,498
GUARD 1: Muddy,
would you please sit down?

797
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,636
My baby sister did it!
My baby sister just passed the Bar.

798
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:59,646
Yeah, yeah. I understand,
but you have to sit down.

799
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,805
GUARD 2:
Waters, have a seat.

800
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,748
You have to take a seat, now!

801
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,144
Right, okay.
I'm gonna take a seat.

802
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,852
Sit down. No, come on.

803
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,649
(KENNY WHOOPS)

804
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:11,952
Gel the hell off of me!
What the hell is wrong with you?

805
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,256
Sit down! Sit down.

806
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,455
(LAUGHS) Okay.

807
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,530
I'm cool.
I'm all right.

808
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,860
Okay, okay.

809
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:28,800
So proud of you.

810
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,005
I'm proud of you.

811
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:38,943
OFFICER: Ayer police.

812
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,289
Hi. I'm an attorney, and I'm calling
regarding evidence from a 1983 case.

813
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:45,317
Your flame, please?

814
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:47,055
Um...

815
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,391
Abra Rice.

816
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,659
If they realize I'm one
of the Waters kids,

817
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,532
God knows what they'd do
to the evidence. You know?

818
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,968
I just don't trust them.

819
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,130
ABRA: You could have
used your married name.

820
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,468
Yeah, but then
when I want to be me,

821
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,133
I won't be able to
'cause I was someone else.

822
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,870
I want to be me
when I need to be me.

823
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,878
So to solve this problem,
you decided to be me?

824
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,243
Just this once.

825
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:09,184
Nice. Yeah,
l love those shoes.

826
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,548
But from this point on...

827
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:11,745
You need me to be me.

828
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,912
Right.

829
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,986
Okay. So what did the Ayer
Police tell me, again?

830
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,682
They don't have the
evidence there anymore.

831
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,490
It's at the courthouse
where we had Kenny's trial.

832
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,258
That's where I need you
to call on Monday.

833
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,591
On Monday. Okay.

834
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,031
I understand if you can't help.

835
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,367
I mean, I don't wanna do anything
to jeopardize your new job.

836
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,235
I mean, this is my cause, not yours.

837
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,239
It's my cause, too.

838
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,277
Okay. Does this make me
look like Barbara Bush?

839
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,437
A little.

840
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,939
Yeah.

841
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,941
I don't deserve
a friend like you.

842
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,412
You're damn right you don't.

843
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,085
That's right.
Waters. 1983.

844
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,092
Okay, well, isn't it possible
that it's still ln., .

845
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,292
(WHISPERING) What?
What are they saying?

846
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,537
Do you have an actual date
when that would have happened?

847
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:06,097
(WHISPERS) What happened?

848
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,204
Okay. Thank you.

849
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:13,305
What? What did they say?
What did they say?

00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,547
What?

853
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:24,888
According to Massachusetts law,

854
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,951
they destroy evidence
after 10 years,

855
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:30,430
And Kenny's evidence was
destroyed in April, 1993.

856
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,262
(VOICE BREAKING)
That is not possible.

857
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,166
I did come this far,
after all this time...

858
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,559
I'm sorry.
No, wait

859
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,936
It has to be there. No. It has to be there.
It's his only chance.

860
00:51:38,996 --> 00:51:40,600
Look, we're gonna
make them look for it.

861
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,904
Honey, there's
nothing to look for.

862

We're gonna make them look for it.
Sorry.

863

We're gonna make
them look for it.

864

ABRA: I understand
what your records...

865
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:49,409
BETTY: I know,
but I was hoping that

866
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,248
by some chance, the sample might
have been left at your lab.

867
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:52,946
But the woman I spoke to last
week said she would look.

869
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:57,289
Okay, well, is Kathleen
Higgins still working there?

870
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,794
She testified at
the original trial.

871

Linda Clarke.

872
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,292
And she checked every single
box in that basement?

873
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:04,799
(WHISPERS)
Ask for the supervisor.

Hi, this is Abra Rice again.

878
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,273
I'm sure Ms. Clarke
searched thoroughly.

879
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,543
Yeah, if you yourself
could look.

880
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,777
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,547
What?

00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,884
No, I didn't realize
you already...

Okay. Start eating.

What is She, 14? 15?

894
00:53:33,854 --> 00:53:36,664
You tell them.
They have a right to know.

895
00:53:37,024 --> 00:53:38,697
What?
What?

896
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,201
It's just a setback.

897
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:42,667
Betty.

898
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:45,634
What am I gonna do, Abra? Give up?
Is that what you're saying?

899
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,440
It's gone.
They maxed?

900
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:49,308
Can't they look again?
They did.

901
00:53:50,137 --> 00:53:51,514
Mistakes happen.

902
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,983
Obviously, or Kenny
wouldn't be in prison.

903
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:55,452
Betty, they destroyed n.

904
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:56,544
No.

905
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:00,353
That evidence exists Somewhere
and I'm gonna find it.

906
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:04,626
Okay. Let's say
you do find it.

907
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,064
What if the DNA
matches Kenny's?

908
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:14,873
Get out. Get the hell out
of my house right now!

909
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:17,301
No, you gotta hear this.

910
00:54:18,399 --> 00:54:20,003
Even if you're
the most amazing fighter,

the most brilliant
lawyer in the world,

912
00:54:22,336 --> 00:54:25,010
there are forces greater than
you and you may not win!

913
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:26,847
You think I haven't
thought of that?

914
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:28,853
No. You haven't.

915
00:54:30,744 --> 00:54:32,018
Just go.

916
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:39,153

(DOOR CLOSING)

918
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:49,163
It's just a setback.

919
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:56,114
Eat your food.
Come on.

920
00:55:57,631 --> 00:55:58,632
Good morning.

921
00:55:58,732 --> 00:55:59,972
Can I help you?
Yeah.

922
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,138
I'm an attorney, Abra Rice,

923
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:05,080
and I'm trying to locate evidence
from the Kenneth Waters trial.

924
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:06,345
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.

925
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,851
Did you check
with the courthouse?

926
00:56:07,942 --> 00:56:09,444
Yeah, and they can't locate it.

927
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,683
Yeah, well, like I said, they
probably destroyed it by now.

928
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:13,122
I mean, it's been,
like, what...

929
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,682
Betty Anne Waters?

930
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,127
You know, I'm sorry,
I don't....

931
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:19,630
Lieutenant Daniels.

932
00:56:19,687 --> 00:56:20,961
I knew your brother Kenny.

933
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:22,792
I was a rookie here when...

934
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:24,529
You're his sister?

935
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,935
But I am an attorney,
and he is my client.

936
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,337
DANIELS: Holy shit!

937
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:30,537
My sister won't even
send me a birthday card!

938
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:34,443
I was just telling Ms.
Waters that we don't have any evidence here.

939
00:56:34,935 --> 00:56:36,642
Here? From back then?

940
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:38,377
That's a lot of years.

941
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:40,211
Would you mind looking?

942
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:42,778
You're really his lawyer, huh?

943
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:43,947
Yeah.

944
00:57:04,064 --> 00:57:06,135
That's it for the old evidence.

945
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,508
And there's nowhere else?

946
00:57:07,568 --> 00:57:09,138
That's it, just supplies.

947
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:13,411
Working hard for your brother.
I wish I had better news for you.

948
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:19,553

Oh, yeah, Stanley Randall.

He found out
that you were dirty,

what it was like

to be the only woman on
that police force. Hmm?

I wasn't dirty, and the
rape charge wasn't false.

The truth is, they never got
over me solving the Brow murder.

are you out of your mind?

This is it.
This is what we've been waiting for!

take the fucking test?

Why now, all of a sudden,
out of the blue?

1116
01:08:37,424 --> 01:08:39,370
Why can't you be in the
room when they test me?

1117
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:42,771
They won't allow that.
They're not gonna agree to that!

So, I'm supposed to trust a
bunch of staties to do it?

This isn't a choice.
You have to do this.

and now they're doing nothing?

Or if the crime samples
are still there?

Why aren't you doing
anything about this?

We call the DA's office every
day, and the crime lab,

It's over, honey.

Didn't I fucking tell you?

1296

They made fools
out of both of us.

1297

Why is everyone
congratulating me?

You proved he's innocent.

1304

Yeah, well, not to
Martha Coakley, I didn't.

Kenny will not survive
another trial!

1308
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:16,941
And I'll be damned if we have to
prove his innocence all over again

1309
01:18:17,003 --> 01:18:18,141
just because of
that evil bitch.

1310

There won't be atrial
if we gather new evidence.

How are we gonna do that?

Think about it.

1313

The DNA doesn't just prove
that Kenny's innocent...

1314

It proves all those
witnesses were lying.

I was threatened, okay?

Taylor, had it out for Kenny.

She kidnaps me, right?
Her and this Chief of Police.

1325
01:19:32,912 --> 01:19:37,554
And they take me to this room,
this hotel, against my will.

1326
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:39,760
That ain't legal.

01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:43,231
And they get me drunk.
You know, am I gonna argue?

1328
01:19:44,156 --> 01:19:47,899
And the Chief of Police, he's
wanting me to pray with him.

1329
01:19:49,061 --> 01:19:51,701
You know?
So I get down, I pray,

1330
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:55,778
for forgiveness, forgiveness...
Forgiveness for what?

1331
01:19:57,069 --> 01:19:59,071
'Cause they fucking lied,

gonna be an accessory,

my daughters away.

I was hysterical.
