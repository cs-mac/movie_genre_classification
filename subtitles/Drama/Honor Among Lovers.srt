00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,490
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,490
Of course I remember!

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,490
When everything's resolved,
let's go there again.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,490
You were putting on a show until now?

5
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,490
You came, Soo In.

6
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,490
This...

7
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,490
It's not yours.

8
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,490
Joon Hyun.

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,120
It's not that...

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,490
There must be some misunderstanding.
It's not me.

11
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,490
Misunderstanding?
What misunderstanding?

12
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,490
Destroying Chun Hee's stage dress?

13
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,490
Causing an accident to hurt Chun Hee?

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,490
Lying about being my fiancee
and covering up the accident?

15
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,490
But...

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,490
we saw each other back then.

17
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,490
Is that a misunderstanding, too?

18
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,490
Why?

19
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,490
Did you think I still fell for it?

20
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,490
Joon Hyun...

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,490
How did you turn out this way?

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,730
You weren't like this before.

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,490
Joon Hyun... I really
didn't mean to hurt you.

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,490
Then was it Choi Chun Hee?

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,490
Why the heck would you
do that to Chun Hee?

26
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,490
Is it because of the new boss?

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,490
Is it because he likes
Choi Chun Hee, not you?

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,490
No, it's not like that!

29
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,490
Yes, I hated Choi Chun Hee!

30
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,490
Who is she? Who the heck is she
to steal away everything I have?

31
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,490
Why is she the one enjoying everything
that I should be enjoying?

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Soo In...

33
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,490
You know I've liked you for
a long time, don't you?

34
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,490
For that long training period...
you never slacked off.

35
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,490
I really liked you... for
putting in your honest work.

36
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,490
That's how Park Soo In exists now.

37
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,490
You're not the type
to know about tricks.

38
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,490
I'll tell you for the last time.

39
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,490
Turn yourself in, Soo In.

40
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,910
I can't do that, Joon Hyun!

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,490
Like you said, it took so
much for me to get here!

42
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,490
I've never breathed easily
since I was fourteen.

43
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,490
Every time I went up on stage

44
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,490
I was always so nervous,
I would clench my feet.

45
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,490
I bled because my toenails
went through my skin!

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,490
I still went up to sing.

47
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,490
Joon Hyun...

48
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,490
I can never step down
from the stage on my own!

49
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,490
You made... the choice.

50
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,490
Joon Hyun... Joon Hyun!

51
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,490
Joon Hyun... Joon Hyun...
Where are you going right now?

52
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,970
Are you going to report me?
You wouldn't do that, would you?

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,490
Wait wait, just wait for me!

54
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,490
Joon Hyun, you told
me to turn myself in.

55
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,490
Okay, I'll turn myself in.

56
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,490
But please, give me some time.
Time for me to wrap things up.

57
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,490
You can do that much for me, can't you?

58
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,490
Joon Hyun, please!

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,490
I need to tell you something.

60
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,490
Everything you said on stage...
is recorded here.

61
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,490
What?

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,490
I'll give you three days.

63
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,490
First, apologize to Choi Chun Hee
from the bottom of your heart.

64
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,490
Chun Hee!

65
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,490
What are you doing here...

66
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Joon Hyun called you so
that you and I can meet.

67
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,490
Have a seat, Chun Hee.

68
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,490
Why would Jang Joon Hyun do that...

69
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,490
I apologize.

70
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,490
Everything was my fault.

71
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,490
To be honest... the accident
on stage was also my fault.

72
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,490
- You did that?
- I must've been blinded by jealousy.

73
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,490
I just hated you at the time...

74
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,490
so I only wished that you'd disappear.

75
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,490
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,490
You mean... you did it to
me because you hated me.

77
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,490
But Jang Joon Hyun got
hurt instead of me?

78
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,490
Chun Hee, I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that either.

79
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,490
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,490
I can never forgive you.

81
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,490
Jang Joon Hyun almost died from it.
You know that, don't you?

82
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,490
I'll turn myself in. I will, but...

83
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,490
just give me a little bit of time.

84
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,930
You said you became a singer
because of your father, right?

85
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,490
Just like you have your precious father

86
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,490
I have my mom. Her only hope is me.

87
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,490
But if I go straight to the police
station, my mom might faint.

88
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,490
Please, I'm begging you, Chun Hee.

89
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,490
Give me a little time to
wrap things up, will you?

90
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,490
It's my fault.

91
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,490
Yes... I need time.

92
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,490
Time to wrap things up.

93
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,490
Why didn't you tell me?

94
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,490
Why did you hold it
in all by yourself...

95
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,490
If I told you...

96
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,490
would you have been okay
with the temper you have?

97
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,490
You'd have run over there
and made a ruckus!

98
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,490
You don't know how they
would have reacted...

99
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,490
You could've even been in trouble.

100
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,490
You had no evidence other
than my statement.

101
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,490
Look at me.

102
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,490
Well done!

103
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,490
You knew how to embrace a secret

104
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,490
and you carefully secured evidence.

105
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,490
Good job!

106
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,700
You did a better job.

107
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,490
You trusted me and waited for me.

108
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,490
Good job.

109
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,490
- Dad, I'm going out.
- Where are you going?

110
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,490
Yes, I'm going to a
homeless shelter to sing.

111
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,490
Isn't that hard?

112
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,490
Dad, I think things have
been going to easy for me.

113
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,490
I got recognized by people quickly...

114
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,490
If I compare it to marathon, I
haven't even run one kilometer yet.

115
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,490
Even if things go well again, I
plan to continue volunteer work.

116
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,490
It's rewarding to sing for the homeless
and they like my singing.

117
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,490
But more than that, I like it.

118
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,490
I feel like I'm learning
more from them.

119
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,490
Don't forget to eat!

120
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,490
- See you later.
- Okay.

121
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,490
Hello?

122
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,490
My Chun Hee wouldn't do that.

123
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,490
I trust my daughter, Joo Hee.

124
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,490
Myung Shik, I watched
the CCTV recording!

125
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,490
Are you saying you can't trust me?

126
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,490
It's not that I can't trust you.
I just trust my daughter.

127
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,490
And about the clip that you saw...

128
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,490
something must've gone wrong with it.

129
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,490
I heard things like that can
be manipulated these days.

130
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,490
After what you said last time,
I did my own investigation...

131
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,490
And it looks like Director
Yang stole the CCTV recording.

132
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,490
I thought you were
just sitting as

133
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,490
president, but you
actually do some work.

134
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,490
I got a great father.

135
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,490
Oh, and...

136
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,490
that picture of Choi Chun Hee
and you living together...

137
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,490
I think Director Yang did that, too.

138
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,490
Can I meet with that paparazzi?

139
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,490
Dresses are really pretty.

140
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,490
- Mother...
- Yes?

141
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,490
How do you like this?

142
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,490
It's so luxurious and pretty.

143
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,490
Take this one.

144
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,490
Really?

145
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,490
Thank you.

146
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,490
By the way... that wench didn't
just have a crush on Joon Hyun?

147
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,490
My Joon Hyun was in on it, too?

148
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,490
Please help me, Mother.

149
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,490
The evidence that they cheated
is in Joon Hyun's room.

150
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,490
My Joon Hyun wouldn't do that...

151
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,490
Anyway, I'll help you this time...

152
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,490
but going forward, you should do
better so that it won't happen again.

153
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,490
Yes, Mother.

154
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,490
Father...

155
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,490
how far do you think those two will go?

156
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:52,490
The whole time I've been in business,
there is one principle I stood by.

157
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,490
It's people.

158
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,490
Even with bad thoughts
or wrong behavior

159
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,490
I recognize their efforts and talents.

160
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,490
You and I both, if we had recognized
their efforts and talents...

161
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,490
maybe things wouldn't
have gotten this far.

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,490
That's tough.

163
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,490
I can't stand anything complicated!

164
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,490
This job really doesn't suit me!

165
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,490
You punk! You have a long way to go.

166
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,890
You really have a long way to go.

167
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Really, you're such a headache.

168
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,490
Father, have some watermelon.

169
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,490
Have it all by yourself!

170
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,490
- Senior, good morning.
- Good morning!

171
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,490
Hi.

172
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,490
That red pants are really annoying.

173
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,490
Wow, it's so cool.

174
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,490
- Chun Hee is on a program today?
- Huh? I don't think so.

175
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,490
- Isn't she doing an opening act?
- Opening?

176
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,490
- Getting the audience excited?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,490
Still, how can they leave her
standing up in the hallway?

178
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,810
It's a hot day, but the
air conditioning is not even on.

179
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,490
Tell her to come in, it's too hot.

180
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,490
- Just Chun Hee?
- Yeah.

181
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,490
No, I can't. There are
so many people watching.

182
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,490
Really?

183
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,490
Tell everyone to come in!

184
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,490
- Everyone!
- Everyone?

185
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,490
- Everyone!
- Even the red pants?

186
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,490
I don't like her.

187
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,490
Everyone...

188
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,490
Joon Hyun says...
everyone should come in.

189
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,490
It's cool in the room with food to eat.
So come in and relax in the room.

190
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,490
Yes, I'll be right there.

191
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,490
You can't do that.

192
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,690
Chun Hee, you have to come.

193
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,490
- You said you're on a diet.
- Don't push me.

194
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,490
- You should lose weight.
- I'm not eating!

195
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,490
It's so loud in here.

196
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,490
Just hang on. That's why I
said no to the red pants.

197
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,490
What kind of trainee is she?

198
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,490
- She must be good at singing.
- She must be amazingly good.

199
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,490
Is it good?

200
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,490
Hey! Drop that right now!

201
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,490
Drop it right now!

202
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,490
I knew the red pants
would cause trouble.

203
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,490
Get out, everyone!

204
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,490
So he's a star...

205
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,490
He invited us in! Is he pulling a joke?

206
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,490
Seriously...

207
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,490
She touched my bellflower tea!

208
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,490
You brought it for me.

209
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,490
I understand how you feel...

210
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,120
But it hurts me to hear other
people talk bad about you.

211
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,490
Can you treat other
people nicely for me?

212
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,490
Can you do that for me?

213
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,490
- Hello, Mother.
- Soo In...

214
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,490
I just sent a messenger to give you
something that looks like a pen.

215
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,490
I just received it.

216
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,490
Yes, thank you.

217
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,490
Who ordered you to follow Choi Chun
Hee and take a picture of her?

218
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,490
It's Director Yang Joo
Hee of Shine Star.

219
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,490
Has this happen before?

220
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,490
Yes, it happened several times.

221
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,490
I took a picture of Choi Chun Hee
sleeping in front of her house.

222
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,490
Everyone has something if
you shake them enough.

223
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Something's supposed to come out.

224
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,490
I kept the CCTV recording...

225
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,490
and the recorder you're
looking for is here.

226
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,490
Joon Hyun!

227
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,490
Let's stop now.

228
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,490
Joon Hyun, you didn't
send this, did you?

229
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,490
It's over, Soo In.

230
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,490
Turn yourself in before it's on TV.

231
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,490
This is still your last chance.

232
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,490
Are you crazy?

233
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,490
- What are you doing?
- Let go! It's over now!

234
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,490
- Park Soo In!
- Let go!

235
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,490
What am I supposed to do now?
Let go! Let go of me!

236
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,490
Park Soo In!

237
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,490
Get a hold of yourself.

238
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,490
Will I be able to sing again?

239
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,490
Let's go.

240
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,490
Why did we come here?

241
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,490
Why isn't my invitation
getting accepted?

242
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,490
This man...

243
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,490
Sir...

244
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,090
Wait, I have to get
to the next level.

245
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,490
'Sir!'

246
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,490
Get it!

247
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,490
Got it! I leveled up!

248
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,490
Level up.

249
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,490
Round of applause!

250
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,490
Let's clap together!

251
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,490
One hand!

252
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,490
Cheer up, it's only once.

253
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,490
Life doesn't come back
once it's passed.

254
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:59,490
Even if love doesn't tell me

255
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:07,490
it doesn't change just
like the tree for you.

256
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:17,490
I can give everything I have for you.

257
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,490
What did you think?

258
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,490
I've only heard about it.
I saw it for the first time today.

259
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,490
It was really nice.

260
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,490
Were you ever happy like that
when you sang?

261
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,490
It looks like you've lost it.

262
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,490
If you lost it, you
should find it again.

263
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,490
Don't be touched.

264
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,490
I'm telling you as the
President of Shine Star.

265
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:27,490
I really don't like you these days.

266
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,490
I really liked it when you were
popular and made a lot of money.

267
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,490
Sir...

268
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,490
Hurry up and come back to your place.

269
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,490
So that I can make some money!

270
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,490
I'll wait for you.

271
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,490
This...

272
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,490
What's this?

273
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,490
It's your first love that
you were looking for.

274
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,490
Goodness, when did you...

275
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,490
He might be your first love...

276
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:28,910
but to me, you're my last love.

277
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,490
Ji Sook, please be happy.

278
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,490
Bro!

279
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,490
You should have this!

280
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,490
I had a commercial shooting,
and I got so much chocolate.

281
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,490
Enjoy.

282
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,490
Senior!

283
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,490
My niece is your fan. She
asked for your autograph...

284
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,490
I guess the answer is no?

285
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,490
- Why would I say no? Let me see.
- Really?

286
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,490
- Should we take a picture, too?
- Really?

287
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,490
- Choi Chun Hee!
- Yes?

288
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,970
Why don't you take a picture of us?

289
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Me?

290
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,490
Okay, I'm taking a picture.

291
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,490
One, two, three!

292
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,490
Close, close.
We should take one close together.

293
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,490
Here. Let's take one standing close.

294
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,490
One, two, three.

295
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,490
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much!

296
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,490
What?

297
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,490
Did you eat something bad?

298
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,490
I'm doing well, right?

299
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,490
- Pat my head please.
- Pat your head?

300
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,490
What the?

301
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,490
Is moderation so difficult for you?

302
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,490
- You told me to be nice.
- What a joke.

303
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,490
Place Choi Chun Hee on
a different program?

304
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,490
I think it'll be tough to ask
given the things going on now.

305
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,490
If you're willing to be a DJ for a day,
I'll ask Producer Kim.

306
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,490
I looked everywhere
that she would go...

307
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,490
- And?
- But I couldn't find her.

308
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,490
Should I file a missing
person's report?

309
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,490
You call yourself a manager...

310
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,490
By the way, did something
happen between

311
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,490
Soo In and Jang
Joon Hyun recently?

312
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,490
Soo In doesn't talk about
things like that...

313
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,490
Got it. You can leave now.

314
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,490
Yes?

315
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,490
Jang Joon Hyun!

316
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,490
Congratulate me.

317
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,490
I'm on a radio program!

318
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,490
Really?

319
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'll be a guest and I'll
be singing a song, too.

320
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,490
- Are you climbing up?
- Am I?

321
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,490
Get inside.

322
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,490
I'll come by later to cheer you on.

323
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,490
To give you this.

324
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,490
Get inside.

325
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,490
Mom, don't look for me for a while.

326
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,490
Fighting!

327
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,490
I want to do well.

328
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,490
Joon Hyun!

329
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,490
Are you the DJ?

330
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:01,490
The DJ had an emergency,
so I'm filling in.

331
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,490
- Emergency? Natural disaster?
- Emergency?

332
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,490
Hello?

333
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,490
Can you give me water?

334
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,490
I have it ready.

335
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,490
- Let's do well.
- Yes.

336
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,490
For sure.

337
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,490
Now, it's time for 'Decide for My
Heart, ' stories from the listeners.

338
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,490
Our guests of the day
Mr. Shin Hyo Yeol and

339
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,490
Miss Choi Chun Hee
will read the stories.

340
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

341
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:47,490
Hello, I'm a woman in my 20's who can't
decide between two very different men.

342
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,490
One is a guy from my neighborhood
that I've known since my childhood.

343
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,490
He has a temper, so I've never
considered him as a man.

344
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,490
But the owner of the
cafe that I work

345
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,490
part-time is showing
his interest in me.

346
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,490
Seon Joo, what are you
doing after work today?

347
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,490
I want to give you a ride
and have dinner together.

348
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,490
I'm a good cook.

349
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,490
Hyo Yeol, you should
use the mic in front

350
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,490
of you to get the
sound out properly.

351
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,490
- I see.
- Please.

352
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,490
- Really?
- Please continue.

353
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,490
He's cool and capable, enough to
make other employees jealous.

354
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,490
I couldn't believe someone
like that likes me.

355
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,490
It's a happy concern between the
neighborhood guy and the cafe owner.

356
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,490
Don't add meaningless ad-lib.

357
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,490
- Please follow the direction.
- Yes. Follow the direction.

358
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:50,490
And I can't say I didn't like the owner
who had money, and was also nice.

359
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:54,490
Then one day, the cafe
owner gave me a ride

360
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,490
and kissed me suddenly
in front of my house.

361
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,490
Seon Joo... you know how I feel, right?

362
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,490
You do...

363
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,490
Stop!

364
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,490
"Stop," that's what the
neighborhood guy said.

365
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:18,490
And everything ended there. Stop!

366
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,490
Miss Choi Chun Hee, you're
very good at reading stories.

367
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,490
You're really awesome, too.

368
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,490
Joon Hyun...

369
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,490
You want to die?

370
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,490
Why would I want to die? I'm sorry.

371
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,490
I wonder why I was like that back then.
I didn't even see my parents then.

372
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,490
I had no friends...

373
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,490
If I didn't stop you, you were really
going to kiss her, weren't you?

374
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,490
You really went overboard.

375
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,490
Try that one more time, I'm going
to stop you from going on air!

376
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:06,490
What do you mean 'stop'?
Why would you be so upset?

377
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,490
Do you have high blood pressure?

378
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,490
Okay, Joon Hyun... I mean, sir...

379
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,490
I'm really sorry about everything, sir.
I'm very sorry.

380
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,490
So please, get me on the
program again next time.

381
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,490
You can talk to Producer Kim.

382
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,490
I'm working to death for this program.

383
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,530
See? Choi Chun Hee looks like this,
but still I'm putting my best effort.

384
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Her face... I can't
connect my feelings...

385
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,490
Kneel.

386
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,490
So, please tell Producer Kim...

387
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,490
What? You can't bring up your feelings?

388
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,490
What's wrong with Choi Chun Hee?

389
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,490
What's wrong with my Chun Hee!

390
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,490
You know, we all know...
faces like that...

391
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,120
What's with you?

392
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,490
You... I'll talk to
Producer Kim, but...

393
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,490
Watch what you say. Seriously, you...

394
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,490
Thank you for today.

395
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,490
About what? For cheering you on?

396
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,490
You think I'm stupid?

397
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,490
You put me on the program.

398
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,490
I didn't.

399
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,490
I went on a program for the
first time in a million years.

400
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,490
And the program DJ is Jang Joon Hyun.

401
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,490
Wow, you think I'd believe
that coincidence?

402
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,490
How did you know?

403
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,490
Don't do that again.

404
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,490
I want to come back on my own.

405
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,490
Please.

406
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,490
But thank you so much
for your thoughts.

407
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,490
Really?

408
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,490
Then pat my head.

409
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,490
Pat your head?

410
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,490
Good night.

411
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,490
Good night.

412
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,490
Father!

413
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,490
Father, shouldn't you
get surgery soon?

414
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,490
I don't want to be away
from my children and

415
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,490
spend my remaining
time in the hospital.

416
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,490
Please keep it a secret from Chun Hee
and Byul to the end.

417
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:46,490
Okay?

418
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,490
I understand.

419
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,490
And...

420
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,490
can I ask you for one more favor?

421
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,490
I know it's a lot to ask...

422
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,490
but can you be with my Chun Hee?

423
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,490
Of course I will.

424
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,490
I don't mean it that way...

425
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:25,490
Before I leave, if I can see you two
living together under the same roof

426
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,490
I think I'll feel at ease.

427
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,490
'Before I leave'?

428
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,490
Why would you say that?

429
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,490
Please.

430
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,490
Tae Song...

431
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,490
What's going on?

432
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:10,490
Well, Tae Song entered
'Voice of Trot' this time...

433
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,490
If he passed this round,
he could've been

434
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,490
on the monthly competition.
What a waste!

435
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,490
There was something like that?

436
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,490
Well, even professional
singers enter it too...

437
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,490
Of course I wouldn't pass...

438
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,490
Don't say that. You're
a trot god, Tae Song.

439
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,490
Yes, Tae Song. I'm your number one fan.

440
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,490
Don't ever give up!
You have to cheer up!

441
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,490
Hey, Jang Joon Hyun...

442
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,490
Tell me honestly. You're
the god of music.

443
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,730
If you tell me there is no
future for me, I will stop.

444
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,490
I have... no future, do I?

445
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,490
When you think about it,
do you honestly think...

446
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,490
There is.

447
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,490
You have a future.

448
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,490
- I do?
- Set a good concept and shoot a demo.

449
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,490
That sounds good!

450
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,490
Yes, yes, that's what you should do!
Joon Hyun can help, right?

451
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,490
Really? I was going to stop.

452
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,490
But I'm doing this
again because of you.

453
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,490
- Can I say hello now?
- Wait, wait.

454
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,490
- Go!
- Hello.

455
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,490
Playing hard to get with trot!

456
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,490
Playing hard to get
with trot, the man!

457
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,490
The woman!

458
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,490
You're my partner.

459
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,490
My partner forever.

460
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,490
- Tae Song.
- The best gift in my life.

461
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,490
You and I were strangers.

462
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:26,490
Living a good or bad life
depends on the fate

463
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,490
But I only love you!

464
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:36,490
My partner forever!

465
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:51,490
Let's hear from MJ, the 11th
participant in 'Voice of Trot.'

466
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,490
What, what, what is it?

467
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,490
Who, who, who are you?

468
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,490
Please don't leave me alone.

469
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,490
What, what, what is it?

470
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,490
I might lose weight.

471
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:30,490
Please don't leave me alone.

472
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:37,490
By the way, what's your reason for
entering our 'Voice of Trot, ' MJ?

473
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,490
To be honest, I became a
singer before I knew it.

474
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,490
When I thought about it, it was too
easy for me to become a singer.

475
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,490
I wanted to return
to the beginning and

476
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,490
restart, so I challenged
myself to this corner.

477
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,490
Choi Chun Hee...

478
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,490
Hello, MJ!

479
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,490
President...

480
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,490
- What?
- MJ!

481
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,490
You're MJ.

482
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,490
Anyone would know from
listening to the radio

483
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,490
- that you're MJ.
- You listen to the radio, too?

484
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,490
Of course.

485
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,700
If I pass this blind audition, I
can go on to the final round.

486
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,490
Until then, please
keep it a secret...

487
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,490
Well... I'll see how you do.

488
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,490
I'll keep that secret.

489
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,490
Thank you.

490
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,490
What secret?

491
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,490
No comment.

492
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,490
That punk...

493
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,490
Oh, Mr. Jang Joon Hyun,
what's going on?

494
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:17,490
You have a nice tie today.

495
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,490
- What?
- Your hairstyle is nice, too.

496
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,090
I've had the same style for six years.

497
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,490
Shine Star stock price has gone up
a lot because of me, hasn't it?

498
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,490
A very little.

499
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,490
What is it that you want to say?

500
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,490
Well...

501
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,490
What's the secret that you talked
about with Choi Chun Hee?

502
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,490
She didn't tell you?

503
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,490
My goodness, you really don't know?

504
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,490
This is embarrassing...

505
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,490
Are you really going out with her?

506
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,490
You really suck. If you don't
want to tell me, then don't.

507
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,490
That's really immature.

508
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,490
Jang Joon Hyun...

509
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,490
Jang Joon Hyun...

510
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,490
If you win the game, I'll tell you.

511
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,490
What?

512
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,490
Rock, paper, scissors!
Paper, paper, paper, paper!

513
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,490
Wait, wait.

514
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,490
- Wait.
- Now, start.

515
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,490
Go, go, go!

516
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,490
Come here, Jang Joon Hyun.
Now...

517
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,490
Go, go, go.

518
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,490
Here!

519
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,490
This is cheating!
What's with your hand?

520
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,490
Come here. I'm going to start.

521
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,490
Go, go, go!

522
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,490
Really, as president...

523
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,490
You have a mark.

524
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,490
What? Are you saying that the
culprit is Miss Choi Chun Hee?

525
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,490
Yes, it is Choi Chun Hee.

526
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,490
You're saying that this
was an intentional

527
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,490
accident from a love triangle.

528
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,490
This will become a big
issue once it gets on TV.

529
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,490
I can't just put it on TV
based on your words alone.

530
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,490
Unless you have some evidence.

531
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:49,490
This... would at least prove
that the two cheated.

532
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:13,490
I really want them to pay
for lying to my Soo In.

533
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,490
Dad... what Director Yang
said earlier is not true.

534
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,490
You know that, right?

535
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,490
Wouldn't I know my own daughter?

536
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,490
You would never do such a thing.

537
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,490
Director Yang doesn't seem to know
that I have the recording.

538
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,490
Father, I'll take care of this matter.

539
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,490
Please don't worry.

540
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,490
Jang Joon Hyun...

541
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,490
what do you plan to do?

542
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,490
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

543
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,490
Then was it Choi Chun Hee? Why would
you do that to Choi Chun Hee?

544
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,490
Is it because of the new boss?

545
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,490
Is it because he likes
Choi Chun Hee, not you?

546
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,490
No, it's not like that!

547
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,490
Yes, I hated Choi Chun Hee!

548
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:20,490
Who is she? Who the heck is she
to steals away everything I have?

549
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,490
Why is she enjoying everything
that I should be enjoying?

550
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,490
Is this the voice of Park Soo In?

551
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,490
Yes it is.

552
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,490
So the culprit is not Choi Chun Hee.

553
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,490
Mr. Jang Joon Hyun,
what's the reason you

554
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,130
decided to hold a
press conference now?

555
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,490
I had lost my memory after the accident.

556
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:50,490
So I couldn't even remember
the woman I loved.

557
00:45:53,490 --> 00:46:00,490
The woman I love is... Choi
Chun Hee, not Park Soo In.

558
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:18,490
I hope the woman I love doesn't go
through anymore pain because of me.

559
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,490
It's Yang Joo Hee!

560
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,490
You said that Choi Chun Hee caused
the accident of Jang Joon Hyun.

561
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,490
Did you lie to protect your daughter?

562
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,490
Please tell us the
truth, Ms. Yang Joo Hee.

563
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,490
- Please move.
- Please tell us.

564
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,490
Jang Joon Hyun, Jang Joon Hyun!

565
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,490
Why do you bring up the
name of my precious son?

566
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,490
What brings you here?

567
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,490
I thought you were smart, but
you're not good after all.

568
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:50,490
How can you raise your
daughter like that?

569
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:55,490
My Joon Hyun could've been in
big trouble because of Soo In.

570
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,490
Attempted murder for a man?

571
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,490
Shouldn't you send your daughter to
a psychiatrist to get some help?

572
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,490
You'd better not provoke me.

573
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,490
You're not so clean and
innocent yourself either.

574
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,490
What? What do you mean?

575
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:23,490
Go!

576
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,490
We'll begin the blind audition
of 'Voice of Trot' now.

577
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:32,490
They're legends of trot.
We have Ms. Hwang

578
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,490
Geum Ja and Mr. Byun
Hee Bong as judges.

579
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,490
Participants, please enter.

580
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,490
The judges will hear the
singing while blind-folded

581
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,490
and select the number
of the best singer.

582
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:59,490
We'll begin now.

583
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:17,490
I want to put my face on
your chest and cry today.

584
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:28,490
I can't come close to you
because I'm short of a word.

585
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:40,490
Every time I stand before you

586
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:46,490
why do I become small?

587
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:53,490
When I stand behind your back

588
00:48:53,490 --> 00:49:00,490
my eyes become wet.

589
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,490
Wow, everyone is amazing!

590
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,490
We'll be right back
after this commercial break.

591
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,490
Participants, please leave
the room for a minute.

592
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,490
Judges, you can take
off your blindfold.

593
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,490
We'll hear your short comments now.

594
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,490
Since I've been a singer so long...

595
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:51,490
I can figure out someone by her voice.

596
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:57,490
The echo from the participant number
three comes from her truthfulness.

597
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,490
She's born with the
gift of her voice, too.

598
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,490
The winner is number three.

599
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,490
Congratulations! The winner
Miss MJ, please come in.

600
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,490
You...

601
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,490
Hello, Teacher!

602
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,490
I'll never be a judge again.

603
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:35,490
- Teacher, thank you for your comment!
- Number three...

604
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,490
Just because I told you a few
words today, don't get cocky.

605
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,490
- This is the beginning.
- Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

606
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,490
Thank you, Teacher! I'll do my best!

607
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:56,490
The top three must-to-dos
when I get a girlfriend

608
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,530
What? Is this why you made
such a scene just now?

609
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,490
Of course. What else could be
more important for a couple?

610
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,490
I'll show you what a
real date is today.

611
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:06,910
Let's go!

612
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,490
First, walk on a busy
street holding hands.

613
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,010
You even prepared matching t-shirts?

614
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
Of course! It's me!

615
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,490
Second, eat delicious street food.

616
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,810
Please give me a plate of that.

617
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,490
- Did you want to eat spicy rice cake?
- Yes, fish cake, too.

618
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,490
Is it good?

619
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,490
Wow, my Chun Hee really
knows how to eat.

620
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,570
- It's good.
- Chun Hee.

621
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
- Yeah?
- You look like you gained weight.

622
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,700
Third, watch a movie together.

623
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:11,490
I've really wanted to do this.

624
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,490
Really? Me too.

625
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,490
One for you...

626
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,490
one for me.

627
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,490
Having fun?

628
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,490
- I think I'm thirsty.
- Here... one sip for you...

629
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,490
one sip for me.

630
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,490
To be honest, the
movie is not important.

631
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,490
What's important?

632
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:41,490
- Being intimate.
- What a joke.

633
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,490
You scared me!

634
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,490
What did you buy so much of?

635
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,490
Things to eat.

636
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,490
- Please have this.
- Oh my.

637
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,490
Do you want to play badminton with me?

638
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,490
I let you off easy last time.

639
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:06,490
It's hard for me because
you're not good.

640
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,490
- I let you off easy last time.
- Look at you...

641
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,490
I'm going to play
badminton with Dad now.

642
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,490
He's really good.

643
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,490
What? Byul... is your father back?

644
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:19,490
Yes!

645
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,490
Cheers!

646
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:41,490
We're still on a date, but
that is ruining the mood...

647
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:44,490
There is a mood for eating chicken?
Here.

648
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,490
You're eating well.

649
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,490
We have to get back in the mood!

650
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,490
- There is a mood for eating chicken?
- Yes there is, you idiot!

651
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,490
No there isn't, you idiot!

652
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:08,490
Your eyes are not pretty,
your nose is not pretty

653
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:14,490
so how did I come to love you?

654
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:21,490
Did my heart melt watching you smile?

655
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:27,490
I like you, the one with her own style.

656
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,490
When I was in your arms

657
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:36,490
all my hardships were erased.

658
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:40,490
Like a lie...

659
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:48,490
I missed your warm,
comforting embrace so much.

660
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,490
I think only about you all day.

661
00:54:54,490 --> 00:55:02,490
I think only about you all day. I do.

662
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,490
It's nice.

663
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,490
Of course. God of music Jang Joon
Hyun composed it thinking of someone.

664
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,490
Thank you.

665
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,490
When I send you something,
you should send me something back.

666
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,490
You should make my wish come true.

667
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,490
I'm feeling good.

668
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,810
Tell me everything. I'll make
everything happen for you.

669
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,490
Let's get married.

670
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,490
What?

671
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,330
I thought about this...

672
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,490
I don't think I can
make it without you.

673
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,490
This necklace finally found its owner.

674
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:58,490
It looks good on you.

675
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,490
Don't lose it. Keep it safe.

676
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,490
You lost me altogether.

677
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:38,490
As long as you keep your mouth
shut, there is no problem.

678
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,490
I don't care... It's all in the past.

679
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,490
What? Getting married
to Choi Chun Hee?

680
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,490
Are you crazy?

681
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,500
I have more than enough
of a headache...

682
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,490
When you got married to David...

683
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,490
did you ask for my approval?

684
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:20,490
What?

685
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:27,490
Recently, I saw the person who caused
the accident to your mother.

686
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,490
The hit-and-run?

687
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:31,490
Yes.

688
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,490
Who was it? Is it someone you know?

689
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,490
She was a colleague who used to
sing with your mom.

690
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,490
I have to find her.

691
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,490
I want to find her and resolve
it with my own hands.

692
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,490
That's the first thing I have to do.

693
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,490
And the second thing is...

694
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,490
to marry you off.

695
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:04,490
Dad...

696
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:12,490
I hope... you'll tie the
knot with Joon Hyun.

697
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,490
A career in singing has
a lot of ups and downs.

698
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:24,490
If Joon Hyun is by your side...

699
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,490
I'll feel more at ease.

700
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:31,490
Are you going somewhere?

701
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,490
Why are you talking like
someone who's leaving?

702
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,570
You're making me nervous.

703
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
Hey...

704
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,490
I have to see you live a happy life...

705
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:48,490
for me to feel at ease.

706
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:19,490
I heard the reservation
is under Choi Chun Hee.

707
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,490
Please wait.

708
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,490
This way please.

709
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,490
What will you bring as
a wedding gift?

710
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,490
A house with big windows is nice.

711
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,490
A house?

712
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,490
To take a husband like Joon Hyun...

713
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,490
of course a house is in order.

714
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,490
Soo In said she'd get a house...

715
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,490
- Mom, please!
- Stop calling 'mom'!

716
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:50,490
My ears are hurting!

717
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:54,490
By the way, where is the restroom here?

718
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:10,490
Don't worry.

719
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,490
There is nothing I like about her.

720
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,490
This is the room.

721
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,490
Myung Shik...

722
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,490
Hwa Soon...

723
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,490
You're Hwa Soon, aren't you?

724
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,490
Myung Shik...

725
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,490
By any chance...

726
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,490
Is Jang Joon Hyun your son?

727
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,490
Maybe Dad can't find this place.

728
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,490
Wait a minute.

729
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:11,490
You call yourself a human being?

730
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,490
How could you run over
Sung Joo and run away?

731
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:18,490
After what you did to Sung Joo,
were you able to sleep comfortably?

732
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:19,490
Myung Shik...

733
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:20,490
Since you ran away to the U.S.
after the accident,

734
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,490
you didn't think I'd
be able to find you?

735
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,490
I've waited for this day all my life.

736
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:28,490
I wanted to find you and
ask you before I was dead.

737
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,490
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that to Sung Joo? Why?

738
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:37,490
I'm sorry, Myung Shik.
It was my car, but...

739
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,010
But my car was stolen at the time.
I'm telling you the truth!

740
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,490
You did nothing wrong, but
you ran away to the U.S.?

741
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,490
- Does that make sense?
- But it does.

742
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,490
Congressman Park bought me that car,
so I was afraid of a scandal...

743
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,490
Will you keep lying to me?

744
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:53,490
Sung Joo didn't know
anything but singing.

745
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:57,490
Do you know how much she
suffered after that?

746
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,490
It's all your fault!

747
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:08,490
How... How could you leave Sung Joo
on a cold street and run away?

748
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,490
No, no! It wasn't me, Myung Shik!

749
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,490
It wasn't me!

750
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,490
If Sung Joo was taken
to a hospital a little

751
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,490
bit sooner, she wouldn't
have lost her life!

752
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:20,490
Myung Shik, please believe me!
I didn't know!

753
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,490
- I didn't know, Myung Shik.
- Let's go.

754
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,490
Let's go to the police. You
should pay for your crime. Let's go!

755
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:29,490
Myung Shik! Please listen
to me, Myung Shik!

756
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,490
Myung Shik, please
consider my Joon Hyun...

757
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,490
Joon Hyun is a singer.

758
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,490
If his mother ends up at the police
station, it's over for Joon Hyun!

759
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:48,490
Myung Shik... please... please...

760
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:55,490
Please...
