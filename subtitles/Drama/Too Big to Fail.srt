1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
TOO BIG TO FAIL (2011)

2
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:07,208
We have no intention of dismantling
the regulatory agencies.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,210
However,
we must come to grips with...

4
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,446
inefficient
and burdensome regulations.

5
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,314
<i>We will eliminate those...</i>

6
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:15,267
<i>that are unproductive
and unnecessary.</i>

7
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,584
Tearing down
these antiquated walls...

8
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,053
and granting banks
significant new authority.

9
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,422
<i>In a victory for
the banking industry,</i>

10
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:25,258
<i>Congress has approved
legislation which will allow...</i>

11
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,160
<i>commercial and
investment banks to merge...</i>

12
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,829
<i>and form institutions
of unprecedented size...</i>

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,347
<i>and global reach.</i>

14
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,100
<i>I think it's very important...</i>

15
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:39,069
for us not to introduce...

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,870
regulation
for regulation's sake.

17
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:43,739
I do believe
in the American dream.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,692
<i>Owning a home
is a part of that dream.</i>

19
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:50,579
<i>We are taking action...</i>

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,081
<i>to bring many thousands
of Americans...</i>

21
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:55,149
<i>closer to owning
a home.</i>

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,351
This project
not only is good...

23
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,919
for the soul
of the country.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,853
It's good for the pocketbook
of the country as well.

25
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:03,822
<i>The housing market has reached
frantic proportions.</i>

26
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>It seems that everybody is
building, buying or selling.</i>

27
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,128
<i>The Dow and the S&P
both breaking records,</i>

28
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:14,264
<i>profits soared 93%
at Goldman Sachs this year.</i>

29
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:17,302
<i>Hotshot traders and bankers
can expect to take home...</i>

30
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:21,739
<i>10... 25... and in some cases
50 million dollars.</i>

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,608
Things that are too good
to be true, are.

32
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:27,410
<i>- When you see something coming...
- The real estate bubble.</i>

33
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,911
- Housing bubble...
- Bubble.

34
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:32,214
<i>Don't put it off.
take action immediately.</i>

35
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:35,400
Will there be a soft landing
or will the bubble burst?

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,655
<i>The new story...
the mortgage meltdown.</i>

37
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,391
This morning in the mortgage meltdown,
new numbers showing...

38
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,660
that a record number of Americans
are losing their homes.

39
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,662
More than 70 mortgage companies
have failed...

40
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:51,463
in the last few months
in America.

41
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:54,465
and now the biggest of the big companies...
the Bear Stearns...

42
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:56,883
the big banks are caught
holding the bag.

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,837
<i>The fifth largest
investment bank in the country,</i>

44
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,539
<i>Bear Stearns,
is being sold</i>

45
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,777
<i>for just $2 a share
to J.P. Morgan.</i>

46
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,778
It's being assisted
by the government

47
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,483
which is stepping in
to guarantee some $30 billion

48
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:15,403
<i>in Bear's toxic
real estate assets.</i>

49
00:02:17,756 --> 00:02:20,157
You've got to imagine
that Hank Paulson

50
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,493
didn't think
he signed up for this

51
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,427
when President Bush
picked him

52
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,595
<i>to become
Treasury Secretary.</i>

53
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,862
Hank Paulson
may now have to undo

54
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:30,863
some of the deregulation
measures...

55
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,965
that he and his peers
on Wall Street pushed through

56
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:36,134
<i>when he ran Goldman.</i>

57
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:38,169
<i>Treasury Secretary
Hank Paulson</i>

58
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,171
<i>telling Matt Lauer
this morning</i>

59
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:43,241
<i>"We're all over it. I've got
great confidence in our markets.</i>

60
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:45,109
They're resilient.
They're flexible".

61
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,244
<i>Ali, the truth is
that Bear Stearns is...</i>

62
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:49,913
only a very small fraction
of this story.

63
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,914
<i>our economy
could face</i>

64
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:54,467
<i>far worse
than a recession.</i>

65
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,921
<i>In the wake of
Bear's collapse,</i>

66
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:01,524
<i>Lehman Brothers is scrambling
to reassure investors</i>

67
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,826
<i>about the impact
of the mortgage crisis</i>

68
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,627
on its own assets,
shares of the firm

69
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:07,463
under a great deal
of pressure this morning.

70
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,633
<i>Dick Fuld, a 39-year veteran
of Lehman...</i>

71
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,836
<i>and the longest-running CEO of a
major investment bank on Wall Street,</i>

72
00:03:13,837 --> 00:03:17,805
<i>has pulled the firm back from
the brink during other crises.</i>

73
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,474
<i>But today, for the first time
that I'm hearing it,</i>

74
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,210
<i>investors are questioning
his leadership.</i>

75
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,679
<i>- Motherfucker.
- One key question...</i>

76
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,313
investors have
for Lehman Brothers:

77
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,765
<i>What's the true earnings power
of this investment bank's business?</i>

78
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:38,758
Hey.

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,194
Get up here.
We gotta start stacking sandbags.

80
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,529
What are you
talking about?

81
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,097
We're down 21%.
On paper,

82
00:03:46,098 --> 00:03:48,917
I just lost 90 million dollars
personally.

83
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,202
<i>With investors pummeling
Lehman shares,</i>

84
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:54,271
<i>the big question
this morning is...</i>

85
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,272
<i>what options
does Fuld have?</i>

86
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:58,641
<i>So far he has failed
to raise new capital...</i>

87
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:01,310
<i>while virtually all of his
rivals have already done so.</i>

88
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,711
<i>And now hedge fund manager
David Einhorn...</i>

89
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,248
<i>is publicly questioning the accuracy
of the firm's numbers.</i>

90
00:04:06,249 --> 00:04:07,415
Anything good?

91
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,618
It's a red-tailed hawk,
the first one this year.

92
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,185
Dick Fuld's on one.

93
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,420
<i>They haven't been able
to provide credible answers.</i>

94
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,456
So let's go through
a couple of those...

95
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,741
what you call
discrepancies, because...

96
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,594
Tough morning?

97
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:27,596
We show top-quality earnings.
We beat every prediction.

98
00:04:27,597 --> 00:04:29,864
<i>- Yeah.
- It's the damn short-sellers.</i>

99
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,933
You know the game...
short and distort.

100
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,803
They're rumormongers.
And they're making a killing.

101
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,905
What are your plans
for a capital raise?

102
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:40,541
We're way ahead of you.
Now let me be clear:

103
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,993
<i>we don't need the cash.</i>

104
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,913
You know,
it's about perception.

105
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,615
Buffett, Buffett.

106
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:52,551
We're thinking of reaching out
to Warren Buffett.

107
00:04:52,552 --> 00:04:53,551
Great.

108
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:57,354
You and Buffett
go back, right?

109
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,890
Do me a favor
and call him.

110
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,059
Tell him
Lehman is rock solid.

111
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,213
As Treasury Secretary, I can't
advocate for a specific investment.

112
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:14,102
Hank, you want me
to raise capital or not?

113
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:17,004
<i>Lehman Brothers is a hell of
a lot bigger than Bear Stearns.</i>

114
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,140
<i>The market
is terrified.</i>

115
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:21,876
When I was running Goldman,
I never even conceived

116
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,611
of asking the Treasury Secretary
to cut a deal for me.

117
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:26,078
Yeah, but the Bear
bailout created...

118
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,446
Please don't call it
a bailout.

119
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:31,483
Okay, the very large Bear Stearns
purchase assistance package

120
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:33,486
created an expectation.

121
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:35,354
Fuld's counting on direct
intervention from you.

122
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:37,723
Uh, Buffett's
a simple solution.

123
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:40,826
I think
you make the call.

124
00:05:40,827 --> 00:05:43,161
As what?
Warren's friend?

125
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:45,713
His former banker?
The Treasury Secretary?

126
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:48,198
No.
Fuld's calling him.

127
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,066
Hopefully he'll jump in
and we can all relax.

128
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,068
Relax? We just buried
one investment bank.

129
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,104
We got another one
that's barely breathing.

130
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,806
This is a confidence game.
People lose faith in Lehman...

131
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:58,807
these banks are gonna
drop like dominos...

132
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,911
and I don't have the authority
to do a thing about it.

133
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,880
We're late.

134
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,814
We've been late
on everything.

135
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,783
Neel's team is working on some
kind of a disaster scenario.

136
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,685
We're calling it
the break-the-glass plan...

137
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:13,354
what to ask Congress for
if your back's against the wall.

138
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:14,871
Money...

139
00:06:15,756 --> 00:06:18,591
Is what you
ask them for.

140
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:22,027
The problem is,
Congress won't move

141
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,829
until we've already
hit the iceberg,

142
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,397
and at that point
it may be too late.

143
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,399
So you're saying,
with the full weight

144
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,003
of the United States Treasury
behind me,

145
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:33,772
all I can do is
call Warren Buffett?

146
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:37,742
<i>Hi, Warren.
It's Hank.</i>

147
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:40,511
I understand you've been
talking to Dick Fuld.

148
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:43,213
You know my
misgivings, Hank,

149
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:46,049
about investment banks.

150
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,784
As soon as they started
trading for themselves,

151
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,852
the risk managers
lost control.

152
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,621
I had a very unpleasant time
with Solomon Brothers.

153
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,873
That's fair enough.

154
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,493
But we both know

155
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:01,128
that investment banking
is a profitable business.

156
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,764
<i>I figure it made you
a billionaire somewhat.</i>

157
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:07,233
I gotta believe that
if the price was right,

158
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,969
you wouldn't
just walk away.

159
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,705
You know a good deal
when you see one.

160
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,673
What say you?

161
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,459
I gotta leave that
to your judgment.

162
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,545
People act like
we're crack dealers.

163
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,546
Nobody put a gun
to anybody's head and said,

164
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,448
"hey, Nimrod, buy a house
you can't afford.

165
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,183
And you know what?
While you're at it,

166
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,285
put a line of credit on that baby
and buy yourself a boat".

167
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:29,954
You heard anything
from Buffett?

168
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:32,623
He's asking for
preferred shares at 40

169
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:34,458
with a dividend
of 9%.

170
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,959
We were just at 66.
What the fuck?

171
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,994
Maybe it's just
an opening gambit, Dick.

172
00:07:38,995 --> 00:07:40,662
Sounds more like
a goddamn insult.

173
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,197
- Let me get that, Dick.
- Thank you.

174
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:43,898
We're at 36 right now.

175
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,334
We haven't been anywhere
near 66 in months.

176
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,336
The markets
like Buffett.

177
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,104
His name will push
the price up overnight.

178
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:53,106
You know, I don't care
who he is,

179
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:55,909
I am not spending
$360 million a year

180
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,711
for the pleasure of doing
business with him.

181
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:58,879
Real estate
will come back.

182
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,514
The Koreans have been
sniffing around.

183
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,382
There you go.
And they won't steal us blind.

184
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:05,251
I've seen this before...
C.E.O.s panic and they sell out cheap.

185
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,019
Right now the street's running
around with its hair on fire,

186
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,121
but the storm
always passes.

187
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,356
We stand strong,
and on the other side

188
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,741
we'll eat
Goldman's lunch.

189
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:18,761
So what do we do
about Buffett?

190
00:08:18,762 --> 00:08:21,513
Screw Warren Buffett.

191
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,668
<i>He passed?</i>

192
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:27,603
Lehman dropped to 28 and 1/2
this morning.

193
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,038
What in the world
is he thinking?

194
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,873
He's not thinking.
He's delusional.

195
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:32,741
He thought the ask
was too high.

196
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,576
He's got to raise cash.

197
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,445
I told him that.

198
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:40,147
I spoke to Greenspan.

199
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:41,648
Really?

200
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,184
He says there's too much
housing supply.

201
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,320
That's the problem.

202
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,956
So we should buy up
all the vacant houses...

203
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,809
and burn them.

204
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,766
Dick needs a buyer...
someone with a grip on reality.

205
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:05,035
Barclays expressed some interest
a couple of months ago,

206
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,936
But I don't think
the price is low enough for them.

207
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,872
Bank of America?

208
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:12,042
Possible. Dick's put out
feelers there before.

209
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:14,611
We have to keep it
quiet though.

210
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,846
If anyone hears that
they're trying to sell...

211
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,982
Lehman will be dead
within the hour.

212
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,686
The real estate investments
are killing the firm.

213
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,289
We have to admit publically
we've made some mistakes.

214
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,524
We need to make
a senior management change,

215
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,626
Signal to the market
that we get it.

216
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,028
Meaning what?

217
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,263
Meaning Joe Gregory.

218
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:36,881
Get the fuck
out of here.

219
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,701
You are not gonna tell me
how to run my company.

220
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:43,504
Joe hasn't had your back on risk,
and everyone knows it.

221
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:45,172
Erin Callan's
gotta go too.

222
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,240
As far as the street's
concerned, she's a joke.

223
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:49,276
Joe Gregory has been
with me

224
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:52,345
for 30 years.

225
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,347
And you want me
to kick him to the curb

226
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:55,915
because we have
a bad quarter?

227
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,550
It's not just
a bad quarter.

228
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:59,518
The stock hit 23.

229
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,120
23. Most of our guys are
paid in stock they can't sell for years.

230
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,090
They've lost most of their net worth
over the last six months.

231
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,091
You don't stabilize
the price,

232
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,059
Your traders
are gonna jump ship.

233
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,894
Selfish fucks.

234
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:14,129
It's not just bankers
and traders, Dick.

235
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,797
Clients are pulling
their money.

236
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:18,117
There's gonna be a run
on this bank.

237
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,272
Sources tell CNBC
that both

238
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:27,810
Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory
are out at Lehman Brothers.

239
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,312
<i>In a statement, the company's
chairman Dick Fuld said</i>

240
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,114
<i>Replacing Gregory with
48-year-old Bart McDade</i>

241
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,534
<i>has been one of the most
difficult decisions he's had to make.</i>

242
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:41,420
Dick, the Koreans just
arrived at Sullivan.

243
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,522
Let's make this happen.

244
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,843
My take is you'd be better off
staying here for now.

245
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:50,196
We need you to be
our missing man.

246
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:53,132
We'll go in and push
the deal as far as we can,

247
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:56,902
And then we'll bring you in
at the end to top it off.

248
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,136
All right, fine.

249
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:01,021
Okay.

250
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:09,395
We are committed
to our presence in New York.

251
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,867
But we need to know that the
underlying numbers make sense.

252
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:19,488
We realize
how things look.

253
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,923
<i>But our stock is getting
hammered by the shorts.</i>

254
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:25,075
<i>The value
is still there.</i>

255
00:11:26,494 --> 00:11:28,729
We just started.
Min is excited,

256
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,430
but we haven't heard
the terms.

257
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,033
Where are you?

258
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,701
I just stepped out
to take the call.

259
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:37,237
Get back in there.
Don't be rude.

260
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,156
Okay.

261
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,378
We simply take the assets
you don't find appealing,

262
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,531
spin them off
into a separate company.

263
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,986
<i>- You don't buy that bank.
- I'm very sorry.</i>

264
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:54,539
<i>You buy the good bank.</i>

265
00:11:55,524 --> 00:11:57,423
They don't like
the real estate.

266
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,857
What do you mean,
they don't like it?

267
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,859
Dick, we're making
real progress here, okay?

268
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,877
Let me stay on it
for now.

269
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,912
Min, how are you?

270
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:23,348
<i>Great to see you.</i>

271
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,917
I don't want
to interrupt.

272
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:27,852
Dick, great timing.

273
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:30,922
We seem to be in sync on the
broad strokes of the deal.

274
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,424
Shall we get back
to the letter of intent?

275
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,693
Min, I have to
tell you,

276
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,395
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

277
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:41,065
There's great value
in the real estate assets.

278
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:44,233
How about we walk
through the portfolio

279
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,719
and I'll show you?

280
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,606
We have looked at them.

281
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,541
Well, then you...

282
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:54,710
you must have looked at them
in the wrong way.

283
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:58,412
I just don't want to see you
leave money on the table.

284
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:00,798
Perhaps we should
take a break.

285
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:09,158
Min, I'm so sorry.

286
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,160
We have negotiated
in good faith.

287
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,394
Now all of a sudden
we are going backward?

288
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:14,995
We can work with you
on the price.

289
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:16,929
It is not about
the price.

290
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,181
It is about the way
you have conducted this.

291
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:29,271
I'd like to thank you,
all of you,

292
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:32,290
<i>but I don't think we have
a structure that works.</i>

293
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:40,483
What, that's it?

294
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,699
You're just gonna pack up
and go back to Korea?

295
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,163
<i>- Hello.
- Neel, it's Dick Fuld.</i>

296
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:01,199
Listen, you know,

297
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,101
if Hank wants me
to find a buyer,

298
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,836
you guys need
to step up and help.

299
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:07,173
<i>The Koreans just
walked out, okay?</i>

300
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,175
Look, I'm just speaking
for myself here,

301
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,778
but I think you need to do
what's right for the firm.

302
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,413
Do what's right?

303
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:15,148
What is that supposed
to mean?

304
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:17,116
If your stock price
keeps sliding,

305
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:20,153
you may get an offer at a price
that doesn't look all that compelling,

306
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:22,989
but you may have to take it just
to keep the company intact.

307
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,824
What kind of price
are you talking about?

308
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,458
Could be...

309
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,077
I mean, it might be
low single digits.

310
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:33,265
Last February

311
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,669
we were
at 66 a share.

312
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,175
Lehman Brothers is not
bear stearns.

313
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,010
We've got
a great business.

314
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,911
Real estate's gonna
come back.

315
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:48,147
I am not fucking
giving this company away!

316
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,688
While the real estate market

317
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,218
has put Lehman Brothers shares
under pressure,

318
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,553
mortgage giants Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac stocks

319
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,122
are suddenly plummeting
this morning after reports

320
00:14:56,123 --> 00:14:58,859
the companies may need
to raise $75 billion

321
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,062
just to remain solvent.
Because they guarantee

322
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:04,500
such an enormous percentage
of the nation's mortgages,

323
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,702
there is renewed speculation
that the government

324
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:08,370
may have to step in
and take them over...

325
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:12,740
<i>a possibility Barack Obama has
now raised on the campaign trail.</i>

326
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,076
If Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac collapsed,

327
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,813
then probably
the financial system

328
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:21,248
would receive
such a body blow

329
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,851
that it could be
disastrous.

330
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:26,286
Freddie just
dropped another 8%.

331
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,755
Fannie's down 5%.

332
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:31,625
There's... there's no
bottom here.

333
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,861
We need to do
something now.

334
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:36,829
We're working on
a proposal for Congress,

335
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,365
see if we can get the authority
to put some money in.

336
00:15:39,366 --> 00:15:41,400
I'd rather not go
that way,

337
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,701
but if we get there...

338
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,720
Uh, I think...
I think we're already there.

339
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,139
<i>How much are you
gonna ask for?</i>

340
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,774
A blank check.

341
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:55,177
It has to be enough of a statement
to reassure the market.

342
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:59,081
They need to think I've got
a bazooka in my pocket.

343
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,084
I'm not saying
that we use it,

344
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,086
but if we have
the authority,

345
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,087
everyone who's dumping
their shares

346
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,156
will calm down,
back off.

347
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:09,157
Okay, well, if you're
going to Congress,

348
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:10,925
why don't we give
to the banks too?

349
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,193
'Cause Lehman is looking like shit
and Merrill's not far behind.

350
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:16,029
We'll be lucky to get them to move
on Fannie and Freddie.

351
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,548
We do what we can do.

352
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,841
Secretary, Mrs. Paulson,
over here.

353
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,910
Over here, please.

354
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,480
Mr. and Mrs. Paulson.

355
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:41,518
<i>- Secretary Paulson.
- Mrs. Paulson. Thank you.</i>

356
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,220
<i>Mrs. Paulson.</i>

357
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,088
Mr. Paulson.

358
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:47,740
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Paulson,
this way, please.</i>

359
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,226
<i>Mr. Secretary, please.</i>

360
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:55,212
I got her.

361
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:59,033
<i>Right over here,
Secretary Paulson, please.</i>

362
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,935
<i>Big smile.
Thank you.</i>

363
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,503
That's just what I need...
press photos

364
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:06,137
of the Treasury Secretary
waving the Chinese flag.

365
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,672
Paulson the Communist.

366
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:11,641
The look on your face
was priceless.

367
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:16,297
Hank, I must ask you
about Fannie and Freddie.

368
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,852
We have hundreds
of billions invested.

369
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:23,922
You've assured us
the investment is safe.

370
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,791
And it is,
absolutely.

371
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:30,795
We're watching a great deal
of our money disappear.

372
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,231
Share prices
have dropped 60%

373
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:35,333
in the last
two months.

374
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,069
Carrying your bazooka around
has not helped matters.

375
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,571
Congress gave you
the power.

376
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,372
Perhaps it is time
to use it.

377
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:44,307
The market
will stabilize.

378
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:46,209
We just have
to give it some time.

379
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,079
There was an approach
last month from Russia.

380
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,348
They have
considerable holdings

381
00:17:52,349 --> 00:17:54,049
in Fannie and Freddie
as well.

382
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,886
They suggested
we coordinate

383
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,954
and without warning dump
hundreds of billions

384
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:01,439
of Fannie and Freddie's bonds
onto the market.

385
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,360
That would be...

386
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:07,395
Yes.

387
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:10,464
The amount of debt
your country carries

388
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,450
is a terrible
vulnerability.

389
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,504
But you...

390
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,923
we declined
respectfully.

391
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,278
Even in the U.S.
it seems

392
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,948
the relationship between the
government and private industry

393
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:32,299
isn't so simple.

394
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,953
Was it a threat?

395
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:40,457
No no, it was
a friendly reminder

396
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,459
that with a single
phone call to Moscow

397
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,011
they can take down
the entire U.S. economy.

398
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,205
Well, the book says

399
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,274
Fannie and Freddie
are a nightmare.

400
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:59,609
They are in the hole easily
tens of billions of dollars.

401
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,412
In another few weeks they're
gonna start defaulting on their debts.

402
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:03,913
We're gonna have to
step in.

403
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:07,166
I don't see
how we can avoid it.

404
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,820
Turns out a bazooka's
not that useful

405
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:12,772
unless you fire it.

406
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,425
Lehman's down
another 10%.

407
00:19:16,426 --> 00:19:18,860
You are not gonna let me
get down a single bite, are you?

408
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:20,429
That's why
I have oatmeal.

409
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,132
Dick is trotting around the world
with his head in his hands

410
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,934
and no one will
give him any money.

411
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,236
Korea walked out on him.
Mexico told him to shove it.

412
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:29,438
No one's interested.
All the dumb money's already in.

413
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,307
What about B of A?
Are they still in the mix?

414
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,709
And Barclays is
sniffing around again,

415
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,577
now that they think
it's a fire sale.

416
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,945
That's promising.

417
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,881
I don't know.
The British...

418
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:42,584
they do a lot of talking.
They never close.

419
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:44,720
B of A is still
our best bet.

420
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,255
This can't be
another Bear.

421
00:19:46,256 --> 00:19:47,404
Absolutely not.

422
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,225
They want Lehman...
they buy it outright.

423
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:50,994
But they may need
a little hand-holding.

424
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,530
They just bought Countrywide.
They're spread a little thin.

425
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,431
You may have to
give them a break

426
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,166
with the capital
requirements.

427
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:00,336
You want me to allow them
to raise their leverage

428
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,872
so they can buy a bank
that's about to fail

429
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,074
because it was
overleveraged?

430
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:08,077
You got a better idea?

431
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:11,214
Breaking news just coming in:
Sources telling CNBC

432
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,450
that the government
has just taken control

433
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,719
of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.

434
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,723
Back in July, you remember,
Hank Paulson said

435
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,725
that he wanted
the power to step in,

436
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,561
but he probably
wouldn't use it.

437
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:23,363
It certainly sounds
like Paulson

438
00:20:23,364 --> 00:20:25,032
just pulled the trigger
on that bazooka.

439
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,268
<i>Despite the move nationalize
Fannie and Freddie,</i>

440
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,471
<i>the market is still in negative
territory across the board.</i>

441
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:33,775
<i>Investors now focusing their attention
on Lehman Brothers</i>

442
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,877
<i>amid fresh reports that the nation's
fourth largest investment bank</i>

443
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:39,179
<i>may be on the brink
of bankruptcy.</i>

444
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,481
- Rodge.
- Chris.

445
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:44,198
Bring your money
today, huh?

446
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:50,184
Make sure Fuld's not keeping
any bad news out of the mix.

447
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:53,286
It's open kimono,
to quote Dick.

448
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,071
There's a revolting image.

449
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,392
Did you get a look
at the numbers?

450
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,027
The real estate's
the issue.

451
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,030
They got it marked
at $30 billion.

452
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:07,065
It's worth maybe
half of that.

453
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,000
Don't look so nervous.

454
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,170
You're about to get a Wall Street
bank for the price of a hot dog.

455
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,674
I know that Paulson told Ken Lewis
that he's not gonna pay for this.

456
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,376
And I don't see
how we can do it

457
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,478
unless the government takes
some of the downside.

458
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,246
Paulson is posturing.

459
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,948
He'll write a check
just like he did

460
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,583
for Jamie Dimon
on the Bear deal.

461
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,066
He has to.
He can't lose

462
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,386
another major bank
in an election year.

463
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,388
Besides,
the guy made, like,

464
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,590
a half a billion bucks
at Goldman Sachs.

465
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,660
He lets Lehman die...
Goldman's biggest competitor...

466
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,929
makes him look like
he's still working for Goldman,

467
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,082
he's just doing it
out of the desk at Treasury.

468
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,938
Where are the donuts?

469
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:48,407
Exactly. If you're the CEO
of one of these financial firms,

470
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,977
you've already seen what the
government was willing to do.

471
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,346
Why wouldn't you play
chicken with them and say,

472
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:56,850
"Sure I'll help you out.
But you gotta throw in a sweetener,

473
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:58,769
<i>just like you did
for those guys"?</i>

474
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:03,257
They just assume
I'm gonna bail out Dick Fuld...

475
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:06,426
like I'm the guy behind the
elephant with the shovel.

476
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:08,395
They're all drawing
a line from Bear

477
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:10,296
and Fannie and Freddie
right to Lehman.

478
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:12,131
There's no way the taxpayers
are gonna go for another bailout...

479
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,767
A very large
purchase assistance package.

480
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:17,937
We need to come up with
a private-sector solution,

481
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:20,272
get the investment banks
to bridge the gap.

482
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:22,106
Okay, but that's
never gonna work,

483
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,008
unless they believe
that you've drawn a line.

484
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,527
I know you don't like leaking,
but let us reach out to the press.

485
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,033
Okay.

486
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,453
Mr. Flowers,

487
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:41,857
there's a call for you...
Bob Willumstad from A.I.G.

488
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:44,275
He's very insistent.

489
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:51,365
Mr. Flowers.

490
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,733
My people tell me
you're the man to talk to.

491
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,267
We've got a real
problem here.

492
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:56,835
Yeah? What kind
of problem?

493
00:22:56,836 --> 00:23:00,105
It looks very much like we are
about to run out of cash.

494
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:01,540
A.I.G.?

495
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,642
We've sent over a document.
It's a spreadsheet.

496
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,544
It's confidential, of course,
but it might give you some insight.

497
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:09,214
I'm in the middle of Lehman.
I'm working with B of A.

498
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:12,117
Is there any way
you could come over tomorrow?

499
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:14,219
I'll take a look
at the numbers

500
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,504
and we'll talk.

501
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:23,812
Mr. Flowers.

502
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,801
<i>Somebody put
the TV on.</i>

503
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:31,387
CNBC's talking
about Lehman.

504
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:39,213
...Person familiar
with Paulson's...

505
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:41,382
Treasury Secretary
Hank Paulson's thinking,

506
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:43,917
and he is saying there will
be no government money

507
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:46,219
<i>in the resolution
of this situation.</i>

508
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,889
They're saying two things
make the Lehman deal different:

509
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,091
The market's been aware
and had time to prepare

510
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:53,460
for over six months;
And the second is...

511
00:23:53,461 --> 00:23:56,029
Is that just
TV bullshit,

512
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,314
or is that Paulson
sending us a message?

513
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,717
Chris?

514
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,627
Yeah? Sorry.

515
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,998
What exactly does

516
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,349
"a person familiar with
the Treasury Secretary" mean?

517
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,484
That could mean
a lot of things.

518
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,252
Did one of your
staffers do this?

519
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,387
Please tell me someone got fired
10 minutes ago.

520
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:25,605
The leak came from me.

521
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:29,192
Hank, a public statement
like that

522
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:31,194
can have a lot of
unintended consequences.

523
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:33,162
We had to send a message
to the other banks.

524
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:34,376
They need to step up.

525
00:24:34,377 --> 00:24:36,440
I don't have another rabbit
I can pull out of my hat.

526
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:40,136
Rodgin Cohen
just called me.

527
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:43,542
The B of A team is sitting there
playing brick breaker on their phones.

528
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:45,012
They don't want this deal.

529
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:47,516
The deal is hanging
by a thread

530
00:24:47,517 --> 00:24:49,386
because the closer
they get to Lehman

531
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,689
the more it looks
like a toxic waste dump.

532
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,126
Which is why at the end of the day
we may have to help them,

533
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:58,863
which would be a lot easier
if we didn't publicly state that...

534
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,965
We can't, Tim.
Legally we can't.

535
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,268
Legally we haven't
figured out

536
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,138
how yet.

537
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,109
I am concerned

538
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,777
we are limiting
our options

539
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,046
at a time when we have
very few,

540
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:19,230
if any, available.

541
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,286
I want all the C.E.O.s
in a room.

542
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,255
We've got the weekend.

543
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:29,658
We lock them in a room
at the Fed

544
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,363
and we don't let them out until
they have a solution on Lehman.

545
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,398
Your oatmeal's
getting cold.

546
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,583
They'll figure it out.
They'll all throw in some money.

547
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:42,103
Well, Tim is
advocating strongly

548
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:44,139
that we reconsider
some kind of Fed support.

549
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,374
Tim wants us to pick up
the tab on everyone.

550
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,909
I can't be
Mr. bailout.

551
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,446
The Lehman hole is
twice what Bear's was.

552
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,447
Investors are pulling
their accounts.

553
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:57,016
You want to lend
into a run?

554
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:59,251
What about Barclays?
Are they still interested?

555
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:02,088
They can't afford the risk
any more than B of A can.

556
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:05,626
I don't doubt your ability to talk
anybody into submission,

557
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,795
but it is still
a long shot.

558
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:11,666
And there's a very real possibility
that Lehman goes under.

559
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,136
There's a deal
to be made here.

560
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:17,938
I'm gonna make the deal.

561
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:20,041
<i>With just a little more
than an hour</i>

562
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:21,909
<i>left until
the market closes,</i>

563
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,312
<i>shares of Lehman Brothers
have taken another tumble.</i>

564
00:26:24,313 --> 00:26:26,381
<i>The stock is now
trading at a new low...</i>

565
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:28,318
<i>under $4 a share.</i>

566
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,320
<i>And judging from
the selling,</i>

567
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,239
<i>there doesn't appear to be
a bottom in sight.</i>

568
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,862
So Blankfein
has a speech

569
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,931
he's trying to get out of,
but the rest have confirmed.

570
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,400
- Tell him it's not optional.
- Yeah.

571
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,901
Good afternoon, Chairman.
Thank you so much for joining us.

572
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,336
Whose plane is this?

573
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:48,304
Uh, that's a rental.

574
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,773
Hank put it
on his card.

575
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:53,676
Sir, you know Neel and
Michele Davis, public affairs.

576
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:54,944
Hi. Pleasure.

577
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,645
This is Dan Jester...
our new numbers guy.

578
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:57,623
Hi.

579
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:59,149
I've talked him into
coming out of retirement.

580
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,652
- Excuse me? Retirement?
- He was with us at Goldman.

581
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,019
Got anybody at Treasury
who wasn't at Goldman?

582
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,853
Chairman,
just to be clear,

583
00:27:05,854 --> 00:27:07,922
there's no question of
conflict of interest.

584
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:10,557
Hank sold all of his Goldman stock
before he took office.

585
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:12,292
I wasn't implying
anything.

586
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,060
Sorry.
We're a little touchy

587
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,762
about the whole
government-Sachs thing.

588
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:18,680
Shall we?

589
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:24,235
B of A keeps finding
more toxic assets.

590
00:27:24,236 --> 00:27:26,271
They want you
to reconsider a Jamie deal.

591
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:28,172
They'll split the first
billion in losses,

592
00:27:28,173 --> 00:27:30,107
but they want you on the hook
for the next 40.

593
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,342
You did it for Bear.

594
00:27:32,343 --> 00:27:34,643
Greg, let me
get back to you.

595
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:37,112
What do I have to...
tattoo it on my forehead?

596
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,780
We are not
bailing out Lehman.

597
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,448
Wall Street has
a gambling problem.

598
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,483
If government keeps
covering their losses,

599
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:44,702
they never learn
anything.

600
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:47,154
What?

601
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:49,923
I didn't know if you wanted
to keep lecturing me on moral hazard

602
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:52,658
or if I should just
call B of A back.

603
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,762
We need to keep them at the table

604
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:56,931
until they come up with
a private-sector solution.

605
00:27:56,932 --> 00:27:59,433
Tell them
to stay with us.

606
00:27:59,434 --> 00:28:01,636
<i>- Alistair, hello.
- Hello, Henry.</i>

607
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:03,888
Hold on one second.

608
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,941
Chancellor of
the Exchequer.

609
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:10,345
<i>I understand Barclays is one of
your potential buyers for Lehman.</i>

610
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:13,248
<i>My banks are already under
a great deal of stress.</i>

611
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,550
<i>They don't want
to become overextended.</i>

612
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,819
Lehman is problematic,
but there's value there.

613
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,121
We will find a way
to make it attractive.

614
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:22,323
Just stay with us.

615
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:23,958
<i>Talk soon.</i>

616
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:25,393
Bye.

617
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:27,395
We'll keep Barclays
in the mix,

618
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:30,231
but B of A is still
our best bet.

619
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:33,668
We've got the C.E.O.s of every
major bank coming here tonight.

620
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,038
We have to make it clear
that this their problem,

621
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,440
that we are their advisors
and their allies,

622
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:44,627
but we are not
their safety net.

623
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,596
What should we expect
from these guys?

624
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,127
<i>Jamie is smart.</i>

625
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:02,229
<i>He doesn't have as much
cash to work with</i>

626
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,931
<i>since he bought Bear.</i>

627
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:07,733
<i>Lloyd's a superstar.</i>

628
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:10,502
<i>Goldman's the smartest
shop on the block.</i>

629
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:12,505
<i>And just because
I used to be his boss,</i>

630
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:16,008
<i>it doesn't mean
he's gonna listen to me.</i>

631
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,911
<i>John Mack used to run
around the floor screaming,</i>

632
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:22,682
<i>"there's blood in the water!
Let's go kill someone!"</i>

633
00:29:22,683 --> 00:29:25,368
<i>He's a fighter.</i>

634
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,886
<i>Thain was my number two
at Goldman.</i>

635
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,887
<i>He's selfish.
He's a pragmatist.</i>

636
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:34,840
<i>He knows... if Lehman goes,
Merrill's next.</i>

637
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:39,429
<i>Vikram Pandit is the new guy
at Citigroup.</i>

638
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,198
<i>No one knows
if he's running Citi</i>

639
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,550
<i>or if Citi's
running him.</i>

640
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:11,455
Thanks for coming down here
on such short notice.

641
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,524
Monday morning Lehman
will no longer be able

642
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,810
to honor
its obligations.

643
00:30:17,864 --> 00:30:21,133
<i>We have two potential buyers...
B of A and Barclays.</i>

644
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:23,435
Neither will take the company
unless someone else

645
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:25,737
finances part of the deal.

646
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:29,357
The government is not
in a position to step in.

647
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:33,544
I did the last one.
You're gonna do this one.

648
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:34,945
Where is Dick Fuld?

649
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,213
Dick's in no condition
to make any decisions.

650
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:40,383
<i>We're breaking you
into three groups.</i>

651
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,220
The first one
will try to value

652
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:45,156
Lehman's toxic assets.

653
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,226
<i>The second one will work
on some sort of structure</i>

654
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:49,429
<i>for you all to invest
in Lehman.</i>

655
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,134
And the third one works
on the lights-out plan.

656
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,570
If Lehman files for bankruptcy,
we need to figure out

657
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,872
how to contain the damage
to the rest of you.

658
00:30:57,873 --> 00:30:59,074
Christ.

659
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:01,043
We've all seen
this coming for miles.

660
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:04,248
I don't think the Lehman bankruptcy
takes down our firms.

661
00:31:04,249 --> 00:31:06,886
What, are we
crossing our fingers?

662
00:31:06,887 --> 00:31:09,555
You're asking us
to save a competitor.

663
00:31:09,556 --> 00:31:12,025
Let's not act like you're
doing us a favor.

664
00:31:12,026 --> 00:31:16,230
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you are great Americans

665
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:18,198
undertaking
a patriotic duty.

666
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,966
<i>Your travail
will earn you</i>

667
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:24,435
<i>the love and gratitude
of your country.</i>

668
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,703
I think it was Thomas Paine
who said that these are...

669
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:28,904
Lehman is a trading partner
for every bank in this room.

670
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:31,706
<i>And their failure will be a
massive blow to all of you.</i>

671
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:33,440
<i>This is
your problem.</i>

672
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:35,908
We can all argue about
how we got here...

673
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:38,243
deregulation,
derivatives,

674
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,011
Dick Fuld made
bad decisions.

675
00:31:40,012 --> 00:31:43,648
<i>We're all responsible.
It's a catastrophic mess.</i>

676
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:46,049
<i>The government's done
whatever it can do.</i>

677
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,417
<i>It's on you now.</i>

678
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:50,386
<i>You need to fix it
and you need to pay for it.</i>

679
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:53,856
Let me be clear:

680
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:55,858
We will remember

681
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:58,677
anyone who's not helpful.

682
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:23,919
<i>Do you notice a little
pattern here?</i>

683
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,722
<i>We don't deal with things until there's
some kind of emergency on the table.</i>

684
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:29,024
<i>Yeah, we don't deal
with things until Friday...</i>

685
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:31,393
<i>Some kind of a weekend thing.
When are we gonna figure out</i>

686
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:33,596
<i>exactly how to handle the failure
of an investment bank?</i>

687
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,164
<i>Well, let's do it
over a weekend.</i>

688
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,199
Just I talked to a person
who is monitoring

689
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,536
The situation out there,
and the person said

690
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:42,873
they all want the same deal
Jamie Dimon got,

691
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,908
and they're not
going to get it.

692
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,344
Just a heads up...
Chris Flowers is in the lobby.

693
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:50,397
He's consulting
for B of A on Lehman.

694
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:54,951
Hank pushed Flowers
out of Goldman.

695
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:56,720
Yesterday we thought
Lehman was holding

696
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,655
$30 billion in crap.
Today it's $70...

697
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:02,156
$70 billion in assets that
we're valuing with a dartboard.

698
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:03,525
No, we're gonna
work this out.

699
00:33:03,526 --> 00:33:05,827
Unless you step in,
we're ending this.

700
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,261
Don't forget
about Dick.

701
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:09,063
Yeah, Dick Fuld
keeps calling,

702
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,981
hammering us
to raise the price.

703
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,751
Excuse me.

704
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:22,008
$70 fucking billion

705
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:25,678
and no collateral?

706
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,247
<i>If Lehman Brothers fails
this weekend,</i>

707
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:30,549
there's little doubt
amongst the people I speak to

708
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,650
that Merrill Lynch
will be next.

709
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:34,987
Confidence is a very
fragile thing.

710
00:33:34,988 --> 00:33:38,692
And in our financial markets
it is eroding very quickly.

711
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,926
Lehman's not gonna
make it.

712
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:43,928
We're next.
We need to do something right now.

713
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:46,197
B of A's the only one
out there.

714
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,633
I can put in a call.
It screws Lehman, but...

715
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:51,535
Lehman screwed themselves.
Paulson has drawn a line in the sand.

716
00:33:51,536 --> 00:33:53,470
Lehman is dead.

717
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:55,855
Make the call.

718
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:01,745
We'd like you guys
to look at taking a stake in Merrill,

719
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:04,781
something in
the neighborhood of 10%.

720
00:34:04,782 --> 00:34:08,218
Well, I don't know
if I can generate any interest in 10%,

721
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,321
but if the whole
company's in play,

722
00:34:11,322 --> 00:34:14,590
I bet that's something
that we'd consider.

723
00:34:14,591 --> 00:34:16,692
<i>Us and Lehman?</i>

724
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:19,811
Deal of this size...
there's only room for one.

725
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:28,502
It is a lot of risk,
no question,

726
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,504
but if you stay
in the game,

727
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,872
we all will find
a private solution.

728
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:34,891
Absolutely.

729
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,911
Don't get scared
by the numbers.

730
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:40,447
We'll figure it out.
Lehman is worth owning.

731
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:43,298
Guys, you got a second?

732
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,553
I was at A.I.G.
yesterday.

733
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,554
Next Wednesday
they got

734
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,455
a $5 billion hole,
minimum.

735
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:55,956
I called
Warren Buffett.

736
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:58,924
He wouldn't touch it
with a stick.

737
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,759
We're looking
into it.

738
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,012
It's a very big company.

739
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,198
Thanks, Chris.

740
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,483
I appreciate
all your help.

741
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,693
They're not
on top of it.

742
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,837
Look at this.

743
00:35:30,526 --> 00:35:33,096
Is this even possible?

744
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,998
A.I.G.?

745
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,617
Holy shit.

746
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,154
Get into this.

747
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,727
John.

748
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:51,685
Do you see
what's happening here?

749
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,854
Are you watching out
for yourself?

750
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,822
I'm not thick.

751
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,708
I'm working
on something.

752
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:05,082
You're talking
to B of A.

753
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:08,235
I'm sorry.

754
00:36:08,236 --> 00:36:10,069
I know it's not good
for Lehman,

755
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,637
but I have to take care
of Merrill.

756
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:15,073
Let me worry
about Lehman.

757
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,926
Barclays is still
in the game.

758
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,596
Just get it done.

759
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,345
B of A is gonna
buy Merrill.

760
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,465
We need to make
Barclays work.

761
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:44,003
I thought you said
the British never close.

762
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,971
They're here.

763
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,340
They seem to really
want it.

764
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:51,844
If we hold their hands,
they'll close.

765
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,979
Rodgin,
what the fuck?

766
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,116
I can't get Geithner.
I can't get Paulson.

767
00:36:57,117 --> 00:37:00,253
I can't even get my own goddamn
employees to pick up the phone.

768
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:02,322
There's a lot happening
down here, Dick.

769
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:03,790
Oh fuck.

770
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:06,293
You know what?
You tell Geithner,

771
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:09,630
he doesn't pull my ass out of the fire...
Merrill's gonna be next.

772
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:12,900
He knows that.
Dick, he just told me

773
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,619
they're working
on a solution for Merrill.

774
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:20,841
Those cocksuckers are
gonna bail out Merrill?

775
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:22,476
No no, not the Fed.

776
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:24,478
Well, there's no
private buyers.

777
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:27,516
There's just B of A
and...

778
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:30,151
they're gonna put B of A
together with Merrill?

779
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:32,720
We still have Barclays.
Hank feels that...

780
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:37,056
the federal government
is snaking my deal?

781
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:40,843
I cannot fucking
believe this shit!

782
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,832
B of A made a deal
with Merrill?

783
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,901
Yeah, Lehman's still
our problem.

784
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:49,270
I don't think I can take
another day of this.

785
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:51,273
You're getting out
of a Mercedes

786
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:53,308
to go to the New York
Federal Reserve.

787
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:55,762
It's not a Higgins boat
on Omaha Beach.

788
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:05,822
Okay okay,

789
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:07,824
we've been here
a long time.

790
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:10,259
Let's stop
fucking around.

791
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,496
Main Street wants
Wall Street to pay.

792
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:16,632
They think we're
overpaid assholes.

793
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:20,169
There's no politician
who's gonna sign off on a bailout.

794
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,172
Why would you
bail out people

795
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,174
whose sole job
is to make money?

796
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:28,644
So let's make this
real simple.

797
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:31,413
Hank thinks
he can sell

798
00:38:31,414 --> 00:38:33,182
the good parts of Lehman
to Barclays,

799
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:35,183
but someone has to take
the real estate crap

800
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:37,585
that's weighing down
the company.

801
00:38:37,586 --> 00:38:39,587
Nobody knows how much
this shit is worth,

802
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,655
but we know somebody has to
buy it to make a deal.

803
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,690
I don't like it.

804
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,159
Nobody likes it.

805
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,995
Let's just suck it up
and do it.

806
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:51,466
How many of you can
kick in a billion dollars

807
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:54,219
to stop Lehman
from going down?

808
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:59,041
I'm in.

809
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,960
One billion.

810
00:39:12,221 --> 00:39:14,539
<i>Okay.</i>

811
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:22,614
Goldman's
in for a billion.

812
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,308
John?

813
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,593
Yeah.

814
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:42,267
Yes.

815
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,971
<i>Yeah.</i>

816
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,507
<i>Yes.</i>

817
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:56,631
We did it.
Barclays came through.

818
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:58,533
Too goddamn right!

819
00:39:58,534 --> 00:40:00,969
Barclays won't touch
the real estate assets,

820
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,454
but the other banks
agreed to cover those.

821
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,208
Call the board.
Get everybody here.

822
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:09,111
We got a deal to make.

823
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,729
Okay.

824
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,726
<i>Did you get him?</i>

825
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,628
Geithner doesn't
return my calls.

826
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,462
We can't get hold of
any of those people.

827
00:40:26,463 --> 00:40:29,398
At the end of the day they can't
sign the deal without our say-so.

828
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:32,150
Yes, but do they
know that?

829
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:37,405
Yes.

830
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:39,039
Yes, by all means,

831
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,408
now that he deigns to call,
put him through.

832
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:44,611
Sir Callum, sorry I haven't
gotten back to you.

833
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,447
We're just
sorting through

834
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:49,082
this Barclays deal
for Lehman.

835
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,284
As Barclays' regulator,

836
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,287
we have serious concerns
about this proposed arrangement.

837
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,122
What... are...
are you saying

838
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,223
you won't approve
the deal?

839
00:40:58,224 --> 00:41:00,358
Even if we were
comfortable with the agreement,

840
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:01,926
which we are not,

841
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,928
Barclays would need
at least 30 days

842
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,896
for shareholder
approval.

843
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:08,299
No no no no no no.

844
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,668
He can't.
He can't do this.

845
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,405
- Can they stop the deal?
- Of course they can stop the deal.

846
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:15,407
But even if they don't stop it,
the delay will kill it.

847
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:18,910
Let's call the Chancellor
of the Exchequer right now.

848
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,078
None of those
assets

849
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,698
would be part
of Barclays.

850
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:29,104
Yes, but if the F.S.A.
were to...

851
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:35,410
of c...
of course.

852
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:38,430
Yeah.

853
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,949
<i>I wish you good night.</i>

854
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:44,486
Good night to you too.

855
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,795
"We don't want to import
your cancer".

856
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:09,594
Those of you

857
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:12,799
who didn't want to assist
the Barclays deal,

858
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,102
you can breathe
a sigh of relief.

859
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,170
The deal's not
gonna happen.

860
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:20,573
- Hank, we have the money.
- The deal's dead.

861
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:23,876
The British regulator
won't sign off.

862
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,544
There must be some
pressure you can exert.

863
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,181
Trust me, I've done
everything I can.

864
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:31,685
The British...

865
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:34,704
they grin-fucked us.

866
00:42:37,192 --> 00:42:39,160
Pason's got
100,000 employees.

867
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:41,162
Geithner has
200 lawyers.

868
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,198
Freaking Chris Cox
has 3000 people.

869
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,258
Not a single one of those assholes
could pick up a phone,

870
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,837
call the British, find out if
they're was a deal to be made

871
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:51,940
before they spend the weekend was
sweating us for cash?

872
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:53,942
Somebody dropped
the ball.

873
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,877
They didn't
drop the ball.

874
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,946
They dropped the ball,
kicked the coach in the nuts

875
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:59,915
and took a crap in
the quarterback's mouth.

876
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:02,167
Of course.

877
00:43:03,552 --> 00:43:06,271
The Fed will do
something.

878
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,241
They have to.

879
00:43:13,831 --> 00:43:15,832
We've got to announce
the Lehman bankruptcy now.

880
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:17,834
If Asia opens and
this isn't locked down,

881
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,702
everyone's gonna
assume the worst.

882
00:43:19,703 --> 00:43:21,871
The selloff will kill
the Merrill-B of A deal.

883
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:24,340
- Who's gonna make the announcement?
- I think it's gotta be S.E.C.

884
00:43:24,341 --> 00:43:25,741
Yeah.

885
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:28,260
Okay.

886
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,082
Let's do it here.
How soon can we set that up?

887
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,551
Right away.

888
00:43:35,552 --> 00:43:38,221
We could use the main floor,
the entrance hall.

889
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:41,073
With the statue behind me?
Excellent.

890
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:47,846
Did Lehman actually
agree to file?

891
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,040
Chris, call Lehman.

892
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,708
Make sure they file
right now.

893
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,693
Absolutely.

894
00:44:13,357 --> 00:44:15,658
A.I.G.'s a huge problem.

895
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:18,094
The books are a mess.
But from what I can tell,

896
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:21,163
half the banks in the world
are in bed with these guys.

897
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:23,532
Everyone who had a
piece-of-crap mortgage security

898
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:25,668
bought insurance
on their risk from A.I.G.,

899
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:27,103
and I mean everyone.

900
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:29,639
How could they
let this happen?

901
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,610
They must have figured
real estate would never go down, ever.

902
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:36,630
Hank, Lehman still
hasn't filed.

903
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:41,518
Cox has to make his announcement.
Asia's opening.

904
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,853
Has he talked to them?

905
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:46,289
He hasn't even
called yet.

906
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,859
We told Fuld about Barclays.
We said Cox was gonna call.

907
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,827
He's got his entire board
sitting there...

908
00:44:50,828 --> 00:44:52,696
no call.

909
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:54,664
Cox is like a deer
in the headlights.

910
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:56,917
Son of a bitch!

911
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:06,377
You are their regulator.
Call the Lehman board now.

912
00:45:06,378 --> 00:45:09,246
Hank, this is a complicated
situation where...

913
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,148
Asia's opening.

914
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:12,950
They don't announce...
market goes in the toilet.

915
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:16,020
We have to consider the
appropriate role of government here.

916
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:18,489
Can I as chairman of S.E.C.
move forward and...?

917
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,991
You guys are like the gang
that can't shoot straight.

918
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:23,327
This is your job.

919
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:26,913
Make the damn
phone call.

920
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:35,807
Chris, this is
Dick Fuld.

921
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:37,875
The board is in session.
Everyone is here...

922
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:40,511
all the directors
and the firm's counsel.

923
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:42,313
We understand

924
00:45:42,314 --> 00:45:44,816
the Barclays deal
has imploded.

925
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:49,087
We were hoping you might
have some option

926
00:45:49,088 --> 00:45:51,622
that we haven't
thought of yet.

927
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:55,026
Uh, the markets are
in turmoil, as you know.

928
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:57,695
<i>A Lehman bankruptcy
will help</i>

929
00:45:57,696 --> 00:46:00,532
settle that uncertainty
and, we believe, calm the market.

930
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:03,368
<i>Both the Fed and SEC
are in agreement about this.</i>

931
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,055
Well, let me under...

932
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:06,537
I'm sorry, let me see
if I understand this.

933
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:08,806
Are... are you
directing us

934
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,375
to put Lehman
into bankruptcy?

935
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,260
Give us a moment.

936
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:16,297
- He's muted.
- What the hell was that?

937
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:21,552
Tell them to file.

938
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:24,689
Everything said in that meeting
is or will be public record.

939
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,057
I can't tell a private company
to file for bankruptcy.

940
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:28,760
I don't have
that power.

941
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:31,345
Do I?

942
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:35,983
Do it.

943
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,981
The decision to file
for bankruptcy protection

944
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:54,051
is one the board
needs to make.

945
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:56,754
It is not the government's
decision.

946
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:59,574
But we do believe...

947
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:03,428
That the situation
should be resolved.

948
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:05,964
So you're not
directing us to file?

949
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:08,266
I'm not saying anything more
than I've just said.

950
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:10,018
Thank you.

951
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:25,700
Take the vote.

952
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:29,154
- Mr. Akers.
- Yes.

953
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:32,424
Sir Christopher.

954
00:47:32,425 --> 00:47:33,591
Yes.

955
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,860
Admiral Evans.

956
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:39,230
<i>I'm sorry, but yes.</i>

957
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,716
Chairman Fuld.

958
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,021
Dick?

959
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:53,896
Yes.

960
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:58,017
<i>Mr. Hernandez.</i>

961
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:00,553
<i>Yes.</i>

962
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:02,722
<i>Mr. Ainslie.</i>

963
00:48:02,723 --> 00:48:04,524
<i>Yes.</i>

964
00:48:04,525 --> 00:48:07,561
<i>- Mr. Berlind.
- Yes.</i>

965
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:10,063
<i>- Mr. Cruikshank.
- Yes.</i>

966
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:13,032
<i>- Dr. Kaufman.
- Yes.</i>

967
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:16,719
<i>Mr. Macomber.</i>

968
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,605
P?

969
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:23,109
- Lehman's gone.
- Oh honey.

970
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,111
I should have know the British
were gonna be a problem.

971
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:27,797
I spoke to them two days ago.
I should have read between the lines.

972
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:33,119
You can't
take all this on.

973
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,156
There's a lot of
other people involved.

974
00:48:36,157 --> 00:48:38,992
It's on me.
I'm Treasury Secretary

975
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:41,428
and the fourth largest
investment bank in the country

976
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:44,164
failed on my watch.

977
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:47,934
I mean, I... I...

978
00:48:47,935 --> 00:48:50,954
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

979
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:55,358
Miss you too.

980
00:49:40,388 --> 00:49:42,872
Taxi.

981
00:49:56,139 --> 00:49:58,741
Jim, I'm at Midtown.

982
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:02,112
The ticker is...

983
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:04,448
what the hell
am I looking at?

984
00:50:04,449 --> 00:50:06,934
<i>Hank, it's good.</i>

985
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:13,793
"It is oddly reassuring

986
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:16,697
that the Treasury Department
and the Federal Reserve

987
00:50:16,698 --> 00:50:18,266
let Lehman Brothers fail".

988
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,268
Oh, okay, here it is.
Here it is.

989
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,637
Government intervention
would have been seen

990
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,440
a sign of extreme peril

991
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,475
in the global
financial system

992
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:29,446
or extreme weakness
on the part of federal regulators".

993
00:50:29,447 --> 00:50:31,648
"The New York"
fucking "Times".

994
00:50:31,649 --> 00:50:34,618
Yeah, and it's not just them.
It's everybody.

995
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:38,289
Thank you, Senator.
I appreciate it.

996
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,725
Congress is liking it.

997
00:50:40,726 --> 00:50:42,927
I'm not sure they should be
so happy about this,

998
00:50:42,928 --> 00:50:45,997
but they like
that we let Lehman go.

999
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:49,200
You stood strong.
You've got brass balls.

1000
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:51,336
It's what people need
at a time like this.

1001
00:50:51,337 --> 00:50:53,471
What is
the market doing?

1002
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:55,205
Uh, Europe's only down
a little.

1003
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,106
Dow Jones futures
only off 3%.

1004
00:50:57,107 --> 00:50:59,340
So you need to build on this
at the press conference.

1005
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:02,542
The story is we did everything
we could for Lehman.

1006
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:04,277
- We did.
- And the takeaway is...

1007
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:07,012
No more bailouts.

1008
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:08,680
Mr. Secretary.

1009
00:51:08,681 --> 00:51:10,581
How should we read
what happened with Lehman?

1010
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:12,616
Read it as
I think it's important

1011
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:15,085
to maintain
the stability

1012
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:18,755
and orderliness
of our financial system;

1013
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:23,861
<i>and, um, the...</i>

1014
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:27,231
Moral hazard is something
I don't take lightly.

1015
00:51:27,232 --> 00:51:29,332
Mr. Paulson.
Mr. Secretary, sir.

1016
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:32,703
<i>How do you see the health
of the banking system today?</i>

1017
00:51:32,704 --> 00:51:34,738
The way the markets
are performing today...

1018
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:37,842
it's a testament to how the
financial industry has come together

1019
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:39,977
in an extraordinary set
of circumstances.

1020
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:41,980
The American people
can remain confident

1021
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:44,383
in the soundness
and the resilience

1022
00:51:44,384 --> 00:51:46,685
of the financial
system.

1023
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,253
Thank you all.

1024
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:50,989
Mr. Secretary.
Mr. Paulson.

1025
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,158
What?

1026
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,961
Dow's falling off a cliff...
400 points already.

1027
00:51:55,962 --> 00:51:58,062
And the credit markets
are frozen.

1028
00:51:58,063 --> 00:52:00,931
Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are getting slammed by withdrawals.

1029
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,250
The Lehman thing's
killing them.

1030
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:06,404
I should talk
to the President

1031
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:09,006
about how we'll contain
the damage.

1032
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:11,509
Before you speak
to the President,

1033
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,828
we've had
another problem.

1034
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:16,713
A.I.G.

1035
00:52:16,714 --> 00:52:19,249
Mr. Geithner is
working with A.I.G.

1036
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,084
on a private-sector
solution

1037
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,086
and the Secretary
is monitoring

1038
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:25,022
their progress
very carefully.

1039
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:29,660
He's in close contact with the
Congressional leadership, most...

1040
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:31,529
the White House wants
a briefing on A.I.G.

1041
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,365
They're more informed
about that than we are.

1042
00:52:33,366 --> 00:52:35,032
We've got the same
information they do.

1043
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:38,035
No, we don't believe
that Lehman's bankruptcy

1044
00:52:38,036 --> 00:52:40,071
is taking down
all of Wall Street.

1045
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:41,940
<i>Okay, so how do you explain...?</i>

1046
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:43,943
The A.I.G. situation
may have been,

1047
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:46,713
you know,
exacerbated by the...

1048
00:52:46,714 --> 00:52:48,831
and Barney Frank's
office.

1049
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,184
Yeah.

1050
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:54,554
A surprise?
No, A.I.G. has been struggling...

1051
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:57,623
<i>Well, why didn't you guys head
off this situation six months ago?</i>

1052
00:52:57,624 --> 00:53:01,425
Because the requisite
magic wand wasn't available, Doug.

1053
00:53:01,426 --> 00:53:03,226
But if we do find one,

1054
00:53:03,227 --> 00:53:05,811
you will be among
the very first to know.

1055
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,931
Blankfein on four,
urgent.

1056
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:11,400
I have to go.

1057
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:12,968
Hey Lloyd.

1058
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:15,303
The goddamn British
bankruptcy administrator

1059
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:17,606
froze all of Lehman's
customer accounts.

1060
00:53:17,607 --> 00:53:20,244
You didn't square this with
the British before you did it?

1061
00:53:20,245 --> 00:53:21,879
<i>Geithner on five.</i>

1062
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,614
People are freaking out.

1063
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:25,649
They can't get
their money.

1064
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,018
Not investors...
clients.

1065
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:30,654
If customers think their money
wasn't safe with Lehman,

1066
00:53:30,655 --> 00:53:32,489
they're not gonna
trust us either.

1067
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:35,759
No one will do
business with us.

1068
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,493
You're gonna have
to hang on.

1069
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:38,925
Tim.

1070
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:41,394
Dan spoke to Moody's.
They're downgrading A.I.G. tonight.

1071
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:44,862
Would have happened anyway, but Lehman
put the whole thing into hyperdrive.

1072
00:53:44,863 --> 00:53:46,463
How far down
are they?

1073
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:48,131
<i>French finance minster
on six.</i>

1074
00:53:48,132 --> 00:53:50,399
They don't know.

1075
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,068
We're working on that.

1076
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:54,935
Christine.

1077
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:56,803
How could you let this
happen with Lehman?

1078
00:53:56,804 --> 00:53:58,438
What on earth
were you thinking?

1079
00:53:58,439 --> 00:54:01,273
We did everything
we could, Christine.

1080
00:54:01,274 --> 00:54:03,508
You allowed it
to fail, Hank.

1081
00:54:03,509 --> 00:54:05,310
It was a horrifying
mistake.

1082
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,011
It is having catastrophic
consequences all over Europe.

1083
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,213
And A.I.G. would be
even worse.

1084
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:13,815
The European banks have
tremendous exposure to A.I.G.

1085
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:17,317
We need assurance you will not
fail to act as you did with Lehman.

1086
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:20,169
It is not just
an American problem.

1087
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:22,820
<i>Thank you so much for...</i>

1088
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:24,088
John Mack.

1089
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:25,622
Hey... uh...

1090
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:27,874
- John.
- Secretary: John... one.

1091
00:54:28,892 --> 00:54:32,161
<i>The fallout from Lehman
is killing us.</i>

1092
00:54:32,162 --> 00:54:34,430
The short-sellers
are all over us.

1093
00:54:34,431 --> 00:54:35,964
We're down
10% already.

1094
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:38,466
You guys have no idea
what's going on out here.

1095
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:40,968
How are your earnings?

1096
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:43,537
Strong. We're gonna
announce Friday.

1097
00:54:43,538 --> 00:54:44,955
Announce now.

1098
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:48,542
Okay, Lloyd, sorry.

1099
00:54:48,543 --> 00:54:51,645
Hank, if depositors see they can't
get their assets out of Lehman,

1100
00:54:51,646 --> 00:54:53,647
the next step is gonna be
a massive pullout

1101
00:54:53,648 --> 00:54:55,816
from all the investment banks.

1102
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:57,568
Jeff Immelt from G.E.

1103
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:01,222
Jesus, what's Immelt
calling you for?

1104
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:03,092
I have to go.

1105
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:04,527
Jeff.

1106
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:06,662
You gotta know
what's going on out here.

1107
00:55:06,663 --> 00:55:09,932
We're having trouble funding
our day-to-day operations.

1108
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:13,469
<i>Our finance division is infecting
the rest of our business.</i>

1109
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:15,337
General Electric?

1110
00:55:15,338 --> 00:55:18,473
This thing is spreading
way past Wall Street.

1111
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:21,109
I get that nobody wants
to touch mortgages,

1112
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,245
but we're making planes
and engines, and light bulbs.

1113
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,714
We're a healthy company.

1114
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:29,784
If we can't finance
our day-to-day operations,

1115
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:33,405
every business in America's
gonna be shutting down.

1116
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:43,063
Where's A.I.G.?

1117
00:55:43,064 --> 00:55:44,398
It closed at $2.

1118
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,833
Tim thinks we need
to do something big.

1119
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,268
Ben agrees,
and so do I.

1120
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:50,303
What can we do?
A.I.G.'s not even a bank.

1121
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:52,305
The Fed can lend
to nonbanks

1122
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:55,041
under unusual and
exigent circumstances.

1123
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:58,930
We're thinking of taking over
80% of the company.

1124
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,618
Hank, we can't.

1125
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:06,722
This morning we were lecturing
the entire country on moral hazard.

1126
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:09,558
A.I.G. has collateral.
They have assets.

1127
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:12,995
Lehman didn't.
We couldn't lend into a hole.

1128
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:14,797
It's not
the same story.

1129
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:16,766
Nobody's gonna care.

1130
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:19,569
It's another bailout
with no legislation.

1131
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,771
The Hill's gonna go crazy.
The country's gonna go crazy.

1132
00:56:21,772 --> 00:56:23,806
The plane that we
flew in on this morning...

1133
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,774
leased from A.I.G.

1134
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:28,010
Construction downtown...
A.I.G.

1135
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:30,980
Life insurance...
81 million policies

1136
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:33,316
with a face value
of $1.9 trillion,

1137
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:36,619
billions of dollars in teachers' pensions...
it's everywhere.

1138
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,221
You want too big to fail?
Here it is.

1139
00:56:39,222 --> 00:56:41,223
You got a better idea?

1140
00:56:41,224 --> 00:56:43,541
The suggestion box
is wide open.

1141
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:52,734
I hate to do this
right now,

1142
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,070
but I'm gonna have to have
a press call first thing,

1143
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:57,139
and I really don't know
what I'm gonna tell them.

1144
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,810
Tell them Lehman
exacerbated A.I.G.,

1145
00:56:59,811 --> 00:57:02,513
the simultaneous
payouts of C.D.O.s

1146
00:57:02,514 --> 00:57:05,149
and credit default swaps
put catastrophic pressure on...

1147
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,353
Go back further.

1148
00:57:08,354 --> 00:57:10,655
The global pool
of investment capital...

1149
00:57:10,656 --> 00:57:12,790
she has to do this
in English.

1150
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:14,925
Start with
the homeowners.

1151
00:57:14,926 --> 00:57:17,894
Okay okay, here's how
you explain it.

1152
00:57:17,895 --> 00:57:22,465
Wall Street
started bundling

1153
00:57:22,466 --> 00:57:24,601
home loans together...
mortgage-backed securities...

1154
00:57:24,602 --> 00:57:27,905
<i>and selling slices
of those bundles to investors.</i>

1155
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:30,174
<i>And they were making
big money,</i>

1156
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:32,443
so they started pushing
the lenders, saying,

1157
00:57:32,444 --> 00:57:34,512
"come on,
we need more loans.

1158
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:36,516
The lenders had
already given loans

1159
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:38,520
to borrowers
with good credit,

1160
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,090
so they go bottom-feeding.
They lower their criteria.

1161
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,793
Before, you needed
a credit score of 620

1162
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,996
and a downpayment
of 20%.

1163
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,532
Now they'll settle for 500,
no money down.

1164
00:57:48,533 --> 00:57:50,767
<i>And the buyer...
the regular guy on the street...</i>

1165
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,569
assumes that the experts
know what they're doing.

1166
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,172
<i>He's saying to himself,
"if the bank's willing to loan me money,</i>

1167
00:57:55,173 --> 00:57:56,940
I must be able
to afford it".

1168
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,276
So he reaches for
the American dream.

1169
00:57:59,277 --> 00:58:00,844
<i>He buys that house.</i>

1170
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:04,080
The banks knew securities based on
shitbag mortgages were risky.

1171
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,549
You'll work on "shitbag".

1172
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,117
So to control
their downside,

1173
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:08,952
the banks started buying
a kind of insurance.

1174
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:12,089
<i>If mortgages default,
insurance company pays...</i>

1175
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,890
default swap.

1176
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:16,059
The banks insure
their potential losses

1177
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,861
to move the risk
off their books

1178
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:20,196
so they can invest more,
make more money.

1179
00:58:20,197 --> 00:58:22,400
And when a lot of companies
insured this stuff,

1180
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:25,936
one was dumb enough to take on
an almost unbelievable amount of risk.

1181
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:28,405
- A.I.G.
- And you'll work on "dumb".

1182
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:30,640
And when they ask me
why they did that?

1183
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:33,009
- Fees.
- Hundreds of millions in fees.

1184
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,612
A.I.G. figured the housing market
would just keep going up,

1185
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:37,080
but then
the unexpected happens.

1186
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,249
Housing prices
go down.

1187
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,084
<i>The poor bastard who
bought his dream house...</i>

1188
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,253
the teaser rate on his
mortgage runs out.

1189
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:45,855
His payments go up.
He defaults.

1190
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,657
Mortgage-backed
securities tank.

1191
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,626
A.I.G. has to pay off
the swaps...

1192
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:51,896
all of them
all over the world

1193
00:58:51,897 --> 00:58:53,931
at the same time.

1194
00:58:53,932 --> 00:58:57,067
<i>A.I.G. can't pay.
A.I.G. goes under.</i>

1195
00:58:57,068 --> 00:58:59,469
Every bank
they insure

1196
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:03,307
books massive losses
on the same day.

1197
00:59:03,308 --> 00:59:05,509
And then they all
go under.

1198
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:08,028
<i>It all comes down.</i>

1199
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,531
The whole financial system?

1200
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:18,490
And what do I say

1201
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:21,259
when they ask me
why it wasn't regulated?

1202
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,129
No one wanted to.

1203
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:28,616
We were making
too much money.

1204
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:40,311
You'll work on

1205
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:43,064
"we were making
too much money".

1206
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,563
Hey, Hank,

1207
00:59:57,564 --> 01:00:00,099
um...

1208
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,134
These are
really mild,

1209
01:00:02,135 --> 01:00:04,270
but they work.

1210
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:07,406
I know the whole
Christian Scientist thing...

1211
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:10,643
that you don't
take medicine.

1212
01:00:10,644 --> 01:00:13,462
But you need
to sleep.

1213
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:17,084
Jim...

1214
01:00:17,085 --> 01:00:19,419
Hank, not just
for your own sake.

1215
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,671
Okay?

1216
01:00:25,593 --> 01:00:27,878
You don't look
so good.

1217
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,868
Just minutes ago
CNN has confirmed

1218
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:37,137
that the Federal Reserve
is negotiating

1219
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:39,506
to rescue
insurance giant AIG

1220
01:00:39,507 --> 01:00:41,509
The negotiations
could include

1221
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,978
an $85 billion
temporary loan

1222
01:00:43,979 --> 01:00:46,182
to stave off
AIG's imminent collapse.

1223
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,816
This is a blockbuster,
folks.

1224
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:50,319
<i>About this time last night,
many on Wall Street</i>

1225
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,487
<i>were fearing
total disaster today.</i>

1226
01:00:52,488 --> 01:00:54,488
<i>So another
federal bailout...</i>

1227
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:56,390
<i>of another
Wall Street giant...</i>

1228
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,959
<i>again, as we mentioned,
big big financial news.</i>

1229
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,629
<i>And this affects almost everyone
out there who has a 401k.</i>

1230
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,498
<i>The news comes about
3 and 1/2 hours...</i>

1231
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:06,867
<i>after the stock exchange
closed on...</i>

1232
01:01:06,868 --> 01:01:09,636
Motherfucker.

1233
01:01:09,637 --> 01:01:11,705
We want to go straight
right now to Ali Velshi

1234
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:13,874
to kind of give us
a bottom line on this, Ali.

1235
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:16,043
<i>And then we're gonna get
a lot more in depth...</i>

1236
01:01:16,044 --> 01:01:17,745
AIG securing an 85...

1237
01:01:17,746 --> 01:01:19,746
The credit markets
are still frozen solid.

1238
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:21,749
We keep dumping money
into these companies

1239
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,986
so the markets
will stabilize,

1240
01:01:24,987 --> 01:01:26,454
and nothing helps.

1241
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:29,123
We can't keep
doing this.

1242
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:31,759
We rescued Bear
with no legislation,

1243
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,196
A.I.G. with no legislation.

1244
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:37,598
People think Fannie and Freddie
was a bait-and-switch.

1245
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,200
I don't like it
any more than you do,

1246
01:01:39,201 --> 01:01:41,135
but they were
exceptional situations.

1247
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:44,172
This situation
demands an endgame

1248
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:47,441
that does not rely on
unilateral action from the Fed.

1249
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:49,109
This is a democracy.

1250
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,746
We cannot be men behind the
curtain pulling the strings.

1251
01:01:51,747 --> 01:01:53,915
<i>We need some kind of
an overall solution</i>

1252
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,284
<i>that heals
the entire system.</i>

1253
01:01:56,285 --> 01:01:58,486
<i>And it has to be
legitimate.</i>

1254
01:01:58,487 --> 01:02:00,121
We've been putting off
going to Congress.

1255
01:02:00,122 --> 01:02:02,057
It's two months
before an election.

1256
01:02:02,058 --> 01:02:05,260
They can't vote yes
to a massive bailout

1257
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,028
of the entire
banking system.

1258
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:08,530
They'd never get
reelected.

1259
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:10,532
- Hank...
- We go to Congress,

1260
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:13,135
publically state
we don't have the firepower

1261
01:02:13,136 --> 01:02:15,637
to control this
anymore,

1262
01:02:15,638 --> 01:02:17,673
and then they say no...

1263
01:02:17,674 --> 01:02:21,810
that is really
the nightmare scenario.

1264
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:26,415
The nightmare scenario's
already here, my friend.

1265
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:29,935
We're in it.

1266
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:31,364
P.

1267
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:44,194
You can't put this all
on your own shoulders.

1268
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,929
We're running out
of options.

1269
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:48,498
Then you just
keep trying.

1270
01:03:48,499 --> 01:03:50,634
That's what you do.

1271
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:52,802
Eventually
something's gonna work.

1272
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:55,772
I'm not sure that
that is true anymore.

1273
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:58,341
There's not a bank
in the world

1274
01:03:58,342 --> 01:04:00,343
that has enough money
in its vault

1275
01:04:00,344 --> 01:04:01,844
to pay
its depositors.

1276
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:04,481
It's all built
on trust.

1277
01:04:04,482 --> 01:04:06,784
And...
and, Wendy, we...

1278
01:04:06,785 --> 01:04:10,504
we are
so very close.

1279
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:17,061
Morgan Stanley, Goldman
are an inch away.

1280
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,830
If the other banks
stop trusting them,

1281
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:22,833
if they pull back
on interbank lending,

1282
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:25,135
it's over
in a matter of hours.

1283
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:27,671
And from there
it goes

1284
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:29,673
too fast to stop...
a run...

1285
01:04:29,674 --> 01:04:32,442
and not just
on that one bank.

1286
01:04:32,443 --> 01:04:34,445
I mean,
on the whole system.

1287
01:04:34,446 --> 01:04:37,348
And average people
wondering,

1288
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:39,816
"is my money safe?"

1289
01:04:39,817 --> 01:04:42,868
They start pulling
their cash.

1290
01:04:44,688 --> 01:04:46,655
And after that...

1291
01:04:46,656 --> 01:04:49,926
lines outside the banks,
smashed A.T.M.s.

1292
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,330
A couple of weeks...

1293
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:56,333
there's no milk
in the store.

1294
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:58,235
<i>For the second time
this week</i>

1295
01:04:58,236 --> 01:05:00,070
<i>there was a massive selloff
on Wall Street,</i>

1296
01:05:00,071 --> 01:05:03,675
<i>the Dow Jones Industrials
freefalling some 450 points</i>

1297
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,677
<i>on news of
a taxpayer-funded bailout</i>

1298
01:05:05,678 --> 01:05:07,612
<i>of the A.I.G.
Insurance company.</i>

1299
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,014
<i>Three of the five
investment banks are gone.</i>

1300
01:05:10,015 --> 01:05:12,450
<i>The country's biggest
mortgage lender is gone.</i>

1301
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,220
<i>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
brought under government control.</i>

1302
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:17,356
<i>The financial system
is holding right now,</i>

1303
01:05:17,357 --> 01:05:18,992
<i>but for how long?</i>

1304
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:21,662
<i>All the King's horses
and all the King's men</i>

1305
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,214
<i>are being brought to bear
to keep this thing together.</i>

1306
01:05:50,688 --> 01:05:51,854
Hi Tim.

1307
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,822
I'm on the street, Hank,

1308
01:05:53,823 --> 01:05:56,024
and people are just
going about their business.

1309
01:05:56,025 --> 01:05:59,361
They have no idea the whole
thing is about to fall down.

1310
01:05:59,362 --> 01:06:01,930
<i>We're gonna have to
go to Congress.</i>

1311
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:03,531
<i>We don't have
a choice anymore.</i>

1312
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:05,233
Okay.

1313
01:06:05,234 --> 01:06:07,267
How fast do you think
you can get them to move?

1314
01:06:07,268 --> 01:06:09,469
It's gonna be at least
a couple days.

1315
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,706
Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are going down now.

1316
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,408
We gotta do
something today.

1317
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:15,609
Like what?

1318
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,745
The market doesn't like
investment banks, right?

1319
01:06:17,746 --> 01:06:20,180
The money's saying fuck you
to the whole business model.

1320
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:21,715
<i>Yeah.</i>

1321
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,819
Yeah, so merge them
with commercial banks,

1322
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,955
turn them into regular banks
regulated by the Fed.

1323
01:06:26,956 --> 01:06:28,690
They can use
depositors' cash.

1324
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:30,693
It will give them access
to the discount window.

1325
01:06:30,694 --> 01:06:33,662
It's cheap government cash.

1326
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:36,565
<i>- You want to make them bigger?
- It's a trade-off, Hank.</i>

1327
01:06:36,566 --> 01:06:40,503
The upside is
it'll stabilize them.

1328
01:06:40,504 --> 01:06:43,072
The downside is,

1329
01:06:43,073 --> 01:06:47,076
yeah, they'll be
really fucking big.

1330
01:06:47,077 --> 01:06:49,429
Do it, Tim.

1331
01:06:51,249 --> 01:06:53,267
Godspeed.

1332
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:13,192
Get me Blankfein.

1333
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:16,846
Lloyd, call Vikram Pandit,
talk to him about a merger.

1334
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:18,882
Tim, we're looking
at all our options.

1335
01:07:18,883 --> 01:07:20,885
You don't have
options, Lloyd.

1336
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:22,386
There's a run
on your bank.

1337
01:07:22,387 --> 01:07:24,256
You need money...
Citi has deposits.

1338
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:27,276
Citi is a mess...
you're organized. Call Pandit.

1339
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:37,904
Yeah.

1340
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:39,608
I want you to look at merging
with Morgan Stanley.

1341
01:07:39,609 --> 01:07:41,577
What, are you kidding me?
I just bought Bear.

1342
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:43,212
We're still trying
to make that work.

1343
01:07:43,213 --> 01:07:45,348
You didn't buy Bear.
You got Bear as a Christmas present.

1344
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,217
The market's a fucking
disaster, Jamie.

1345
01:07:47,218 --> 01:07:49,386
Talk to John Mack.

1346
01:07:49,387 --> 01:07:52,156
Hey, Geithner says
we should talk about a merger.

1347
01:07:52,157 --> 01:07:54,292
- You want to do a deal?
- No.

1348
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:56,462
Then why the fuck did he
tell me to call you?

1349
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,698
I'm under orders
to try and help you.

1350
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,252
You're a prince, Jamie...
a real prince.

1351
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,942
Apparently some people
seem to think

1352
01:08:07,943 --> 01:08:10,178
combining our firms
would be a good idea.

1353
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:13,148
Well, I want you to know
I'm flattered by this call.

1354
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:15,317
Vikram,
I'm not trying

1355
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:17,419
to flatter you,
believe me.

1356
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,021
<i>Geithner's calling.</i>

1357
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:21,424
Oh, here comes
goddamn eharmony.

1358
01:08:21,425 --> 01:08:24,044
Hey, guess what.
Jaime's not interested.

1359
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:27,966
Do Wachovia.

1360
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:30,134
They were writing mortgages
with their eyes closed.

1361
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:32,453
Tim, it's a shit sandwich.
Forget it.

1362
01:08:37,975 --> 01:08:40,210
Well, I haven't been
able to reach you for four hours.

1363
01:08:40,211 --> 01:08:43,614
That is... that is totally fucking
unacceptable on a day like today.

1364
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:46,583
I had to run my team
through the Goldman proposal.

1365
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:48,251
It's not gonna work.

1366
01:08:48,252 --> 01:08:51,688
You passed on Goldman
without even talking to me?

1367
01:08:51,689 --> 01:08:55,008
I don't need another trillion
dollars on my balance sheet.

1368
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:02,816
Next time I call,
pick up.

1369
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:05,736
Fucker.

1370
01:09:05,737 --> 01:09:08,872
The problem is the toxic assets.
Let's just buy them.

1371
01:09:08,873 --> 01:09:11,141
Ooh, call it
cash-for-trash.

1372
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:13,875
<i>When the market stabilizes,
we'll unload them.</i>

1373
01:09:13,876 --> 01:09:15,976
Hopefully Treasury will
get its money back.

1374
01:09:15,977 --> 01:09:18,512
- Is that in the break-the-glass plan?
- Basically.

1375
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:20,523
My copy's missing some pages.

1376
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:21,866
Could someone else show me
the rest of...

1377
01:09:21,867 --> 01:09:24,014
It's succinct.

1378
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:26,216
We've got one shot
with Congress.

1379
01:09:26,217 --> 01:09:29,884
You want them to write a piece
of legislation based on three pages?

1380
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:31,252
<i>Look, guys,</i>

1381
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:33,519
buying toxic assets
is gonna be a nightmare.

1382
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,353
Nobody knows what
the stuff's worth.

1383
01:09:35,354 --> 01:09:38,154
It'll take forever to untangle.
These banks are going down now.

1384
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:39,321
So what do we do?

1385
01:09:39,322 --> 01:09:41,023
You want to unfreeze
credit, right?

1386
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:42,658
You want the banks
to lend people money?

1387
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:45,745
<i>- That's the goal.
- So give them money to lend.</i>

1388
01:09:47,999 --> 01:09:49,933
Capital injections?

1389
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:51,524
Dan, come on.

1390
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:52,926
I can't believe you're
pulling out the "n" word.

1391
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:54,206
I'm not saying
nationalize the banks.

1392
01:09:54,207 --> 01:09:55,438
I'm saying isolate the ones

1393
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:57,440
that are really in trouble
and make an investment.

1394
01:09:57,441 --> 01:09:58,841
It's unamerican.

1395
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:00,809
It's... it's sure
unrepublican.

1396
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:03,311
You make the government
a stockholder...

1397
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:05,113
what, do we tell them

1398
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:07,716
how to manage themselves,
what to buy and sell?

1399
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:09,558
Run them like the post Office?

1400
01:10:09,559 --> 01:10:10,751
'Cause that works
like a dream.

1401
01:10:10,752 --> 01:10:12,251
We make it
temporary.

1402
01:10:12,252 --> 01:10:14,819
We make ourselves
nonvoting stockholders.

1403
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,888
You can't just hand the banks
massive piles of cash.

1404
01:10:17,889 --> 01:10:19,756
Nobody's gonna
go for it.

1405
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,557
To the Republican's
it's nationalization.

1406
01:10:21,558 --> 01:10:23,358
To the Democrats
it's a bailout.

1407
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:25,426
And the banks are
gonna go ballistic.

1408
01:10:25,427 --> 01:10:28,262
Sorry, Dan,
not gonna happen.

1409
01:10:28,263 --> 01:10:30,229
Kudos for
out-of-the-box thinking.

1410
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,964
Neel, if we go with your
plan to buy the assets,

1411
01:10:32,965 --> 01:10:35,298
how much is it
gonna cost?

1412
01:10:35,299 --> 01:10:36,699
It won't work.

1413
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,135
Look, the plan is
three pages long, totally vague.

1414
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:42,069
If buying the assets
doesn't work,

1415
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,038
we'll nationalize
the banks for you, okay?

1416
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,506
How much?

1417
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,775
To be safe,
maybe a trillion.

1418
01:10:48,776 --> 01:10:52,110
The Congress will never do
a trillion... never.

1419
01:10:52,111 --> 01:10:55,747
Well, there's $11 trillion
in residential mortgages.

1420
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:58,282
There's $3 trillion
in commercial mortgages.

1421
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:00,984
That's $14 trillion,
right?

1422
01:11:00,985 --> 01:11:03,953
You gotta figure
about 5% default rate.

1423
01:11:03,954 --> 01:11:06,788
5% of $14 trillion

1424
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:11,207
is $700 billion.

1425
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,812
It's better
than a trillion.

1426
01:11:19,464 --> 01:11:21,397
<i>The only way
to get this done</i>

1427
01:11:21,398 --> 01:11:23,432
<i>is to just
scare them shitless.</i>

1428
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:27,216
That should be easy.
I'm scared shitless myself.

1429
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:42,043
Troubled Asset
Relief Program?

1430
01:11:42,044 --> 01:11:43,744
T.A.R.P.
We're calling it.

1431
01:11:43,745 --> 01:11:46,245
This is your draft
of the bill?

1432
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:49,731
Subject to revision
certainly.

1433
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,283
Well, I've only got
three pages here.

1434
01:11:53,284 --> 01:11:54,784
Am I missing something?

1435
01:11:54,785 --> 01:11:56,169
No.

1436
01:11:57,987 --> 01:12:01,321
You're just looking for a
big blank check in a hurry.

1437
01:12:01,322 --> 01:12:04,824
It's all for the banks.
You don't want a penny

1438
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,292
for the average Joe
that's about to lose his house?

1439
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:09,395
There's not a scrap of oversight
built into this...

1440
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:11,897
not for the banks
or for you for that matter.

1441
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:13,899
You want us
to simply hand over

1442
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,135
$700 billion
and trust you?

1443
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:19,937
How is it possible
you didn't see this coming?

1444
01:12:19,938 --> 01:12:22,039
If you want to rewind the tape,
we can do that.

1445
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,375
But right now the one thing
we don't have is time.

1446
01:12:25,376 --> 01:12:28,044
We need an announcement tonight
to calm the market.

1447
01:12:28,045 --> 01:12:30,330
We need legislation
next week.

1448
01:12:33,451 --> 01:12:38,322
I spent my entire
academic career

1449
01:12:38,323 --> 01:12:41,642
studying
the Great Depression.

1450
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:45,329
The Depression
may have started

1451
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,698
because of
a stock market crash,

1452
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:50,969
but what hit
the general economy

1453
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,904
was a disruption
of credit...

1454
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:54,973
<i>average citizens
unable to borrow money</i>

1455
01:12:54,974 --> 01:12:57,208
to do anything...
to buy a home,

1456
01:12:57,209 --> 01:13:01,479
start a business,
stock their shelves.

1457
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,082
Credit has the ability
to build a modern economy,

1458
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:07,452
but lack of credit
has the power to destroy it,

1459
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:10,038
swiftly and absolutely.

1460
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:14,661
If we do not act
boldly and immediately,

1461
01:13:14,662 --> 01:13:17,798
we will replay
the Depression of the 1930s,

1462
01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:21,269
only this time
it will be

1463
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,223
far far worse.

1464
01:13:25,175 --> 01:13:27,177
We don't
do this now...

1465
01:13:27,178 --> 01:13:30,898
we won't have
an economy on Monday.

1466
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:40,646
Geithner.

1467
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:47,206
We took the proposal
down to Congress.

1468
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:48,441
Are they gonna
go for it?

1469
01:13:48,442 --> 01:13:50,243
They didn't like the fact
that it was short.

1470
01:13:50,244 --> 01:13:52,979
<i>I thought concise was a plus.
They thought it was flimsy</i>

1471
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:55,448
or arrogant
or something.

1472
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:58,384
I don't know what they think.
They couldn't get past it.

1473
01:13:58,385 --> 01:14:00,820
The market's in a death spiral.
They're gonna sink the bill

1474
01:14:00,821 --> 01:14:02,622
because the proposal
is too fucking short?

1475
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,192
They're working on it.
They're gonna make it longer,

1476
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:08,394
among other things.

1477
01:14:08,395 --> 01:14:10,764
Look,

1478
01:14:10,765 --> 01:14:12,849
just tell me
you got something.

1479
01:14:15,203 --> 01:14:18,606
No.
No, we're nowhere.

1480
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:20,207
Who's left
for Morgan Stanley?

1481
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:24,361
China Investment
Corporation.

1482
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,680
Mae Mitsubishi.

1483
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:30,317
No, the Japanese will
never do this deal.

1484
01:14:30,318 --> 01:14:31,919
How about Goldman?

1485
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,823
Goldman's looking at Wachovia,
but they're so fucked,

1486
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:36,975
even John Mack
turned up his nose.

1487
01:14:39,596 --> 01:14:41,631
You gotta get
that bill passed.

1488
01:14:41,632 --> 01:14:42,899
I'm pushing.

1489
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,901
Well, push harder,

1490
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:47,554
please.

1491
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:52,192
This isn't working, Hank.

1492
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:07,993
Hank?

1493
01:15:07,994 --> 01:15:10,446
Could you excuse me
a moment?

1494
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:33,625
Oh my God.

1495
01:15:33,626 --> 01:15:36,395
GAO, GAO,

1496
01:15:36,396 --> 01:15:39,732
I am so sorry about this.
There's nothing we can do.

1497
01:15:39,733 --> 01:15:41,734
It's New York, you know.
We're lucky

1498
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:44,037
we can still buy a beer
at Yankee Stadium.

1499
01:15:44,038 --> 01:15:46,807
Don't worry about it.
I should quit anyway.

1500
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:49,361
When you're ready,
we'll be inside.

1501
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,650
Is there any
movement there?

1502
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:56,887
They made an extremely
low opening offer.

1503
01:15:56,888 --> 01:15:59,225
I pretended
I didn't hear it.

1504
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:01,261
<i>The markets
can't open Monday</i>

1505
01:16:01,262 --> 01:16:03,697
<i>without a resolution
on Morgan Stanley.</i>

1506
01:16:03,698 --> 01:16:06,200
We really need you
to do a deal.

1507
01:16:06,201 --> 01:16:08,568
- You need to call Jamie.
- I called Jamie.

1508
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:10,802
He doesn't want us.
There's too much overlap.

1509
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:12,203
We've spoken to him.
He'll do it.

1510
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:14,906
For what, a dollar?
Why would I do that?

1511
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:16,574
I got
China Investment

1512
01:16:16,575 --> 01:16:18,343
and Mitsubishi
kicking my tires.

1513
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:21,913
I know those guys. They're not
gonna close a deal in time.

1514
01:16:21,914 --> 01:16:25,116
We want you
to call Jamie.

1515
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:26,952
Let me ask you
a question.

1516
01:16:26,953 --> 01:16:29,955
35,000 jobs just
disappeared in this city

1517
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:32,157
between A.I.G.,
Lehman and Bear.

1518
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:33,659
We make a deal
with Jamie...

1519
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,729
he'll fire 20,000
Morgan Stanley employees.

1520
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,897
You think that's good
public policy?

1521
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:42,367
John, we are looking
at the whole system here.

1522
01:16:42,368 --> 01:16:44,343
The Chinese are leaving.

1523
01:16:44,344 --> 01:16:45,904
GAO found out we're also
talking to Mitsubishi.

1524
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:47,673
I gotta go.

1525
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:51,243
All right, get me Kuroyanagi
and a Japanese translator.

1526
01:16:51,244 --> 01:16:53,279
We're closing with
Mitsubishi tonight.

1527
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,915
Tim Geithner's
calling again.

1528
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,443
Cover your ears.

1529
01:16:57,444 --> 01:16:59,152
You tell Tim Geithner
to fucking blow me.

1530
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:01,470
I'm trying to save
my company.

1531
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:06,759
Put him on the schedule,
but make sure it's after lunch,

1532
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,863
because that way I can
fit Maddle in beforehand.

1533
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:12,867
Morgan just made a deal
with Mitsubishi.

1534
01:17:12,868 --> 01:17:14,869
So we're
the only bank

1535
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:17,205
with our dick
still in the wind.

1536
01:17:17,206 --> 01:17:20,559
I'm calling
Buffett again.

1537
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,485
Grandpa, they keep calling.
What if it's important?

1538
01:17:27,486 --> 01:17:30,071
They always think
it's important.

1539
01:17:32,225 --> 01:17:35,911
All right,
I'll make it fast.

1540
01:17:37,164 --> 01:17:39,199
Warren, thanks for calling back.
How are you?

1541
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,234
Just fine, Lloyd.

1542
01:17:41,235 --> 01:17:42,933
What can I do
for you today?

1543
01:17:42,934 --> 01:17:45,633
I'd like to talk to you about
taking a stake in Goldman Sachs.

1544
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:48,301
<i>What do you have in mind?
Sounds expensive.</i>

1545
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:50,619
Maybe not.

1546
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:54,806
<i>You'd better have
good news,</i>

1547
01:17:54,807 --> 01:17:57,106
<i>because I might be dead
before we finish</i>

1548
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:59,307
<i>haggling over TARP.</i>

1549
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:02,393
Buffett's throwing
$5 billion into Goldman.

1550
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,848
We're off the ledge.

1551
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,917
<i>For a moment.</i>

1552
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,553
The October surprise
arrived a little early

1553
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,323
with a game-changing jolt
to the White House race.

1554
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:17,291
Call it a master stroke

1555
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,327
or a desperate
Hail-Mary pass...

1556
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:22,598
McCain announced he would
suspend his campaign

1557
01:18:22,599 --> 01:18:25,735
and asked for this Friday's
debate to be postponed

1558
01:18:25,736 --> 01:18:29,006
So he can return to Washington
to focus on the economic crisis.

1559
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:32,176
Now is our chance
to come together,

1560
01:18:32,177 --> 01:18:34,912
to prove that Washington
is once again

1561
01:18:34,913 --> 01:18:38,115
capable of leading
this country.

1562
01:18:38,116 --> 01:18:41,018
Thank God he came back.

1563
01:18:41,019 --> 01:18:45,221
Like Daniel Day Lewis
in "Last of the Mohicans,"

1564
01:18:45,222 --> 01:18:48,007
he will find us!

1565
01:18:49,494 --> 01:18:51,761
- They're blowing it up.
- What happened?

1566
01:18:51,762 --> 01:18:53,496
McCain wanted to swoop in
and save the day,

1567
01:18:53,497 --> 01:18:55,131
but doesn't have any idea
how to do it.

1568
01:18:55,132 --> 01:18:57,066
It's 100-page
piece of legislation

1569
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,135
we've been carefully
negotiating for days.

1570
01:18:59,136 --> 01:19:01,337
What, did he think they were
gonna sit around and spitball?

1571
01:19:01,338 --> 01:19:03,306
Yeah, when McCain
got here

1572
01:19:03,307 --> 01:19:06,609
and found out that the deal
was basically done, he went apeshit.

1573
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:08,511
The Republicans fell in
behind their guy.

1574
01:19:08,512 --> 01:19:10,246
They want to start
all over again.

1575
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,515
Democrats flipped out.
Republicans dug in.

1576
01:19:12,516 --> 01:19:14,950
Clusterfuck.

1577
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:18,288
- Where's Hank?
- Still talking to McCain.

1578
01:19:18,289 --> 01:19:20,724
If you or anyone else
does anything

1579
01:19:20,725 --> 01:19:24,261
that causes a depression,
it is not gonna be on me.

1580
01:19:24,262 --> 01:19:26,888
I have a big mouth, Senator...

1581
01:19:26,889 --> 01:19:28,064
- a very big mouth.
- Hold on...

1582
01:19:28,065 --> 01:19:30,533
He's not threatening

1583
01:19:30,534 --> 01:19:33,002
the Republican
Presidential Nominee, is he?

1584
01:19:33,003 --> 01:19:35,504
- Something's got to be done.
- No no. Excuse me, please.

1585
01:19:35,505 --> 01:19:37,506
Where are the Democrats?

1586
01:19:37,507 --> 01:19:39,341
They're right down
this way.

1587
01:19:39,342 --> 01:19:40,909
- Is Nancy there?
- Yes. Yes, she is.

1588
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:42,361
Thank you.

1589
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,004
<i>Nancy...</i>

1590
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,826
Gee, Hank.

1591
01:19:57,827 --> 01:19:59,877
I didn't know
you were Catholic.

1592
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:03,497
I beg of you, don't blow this up.
It was a bad meeting,

1593
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,566
but we need to get
together on this.

1594
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,568
We're not the ones
trying to blow it up.

1595
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:10,189
I just ask you
to stay with us.

1596
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:15,345
Please.

1597
01:20:15,346 --> 01:20:17,180
The House began debating
the rescue bill

1598
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:18,682
at 9:27 this morning.

1599
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:21,484
<i>At about 1:28 pm
Congress did finally act.</i>

1600
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:23,820
<i>- This is a squeaker of a vote.
- We are down to it right now.</i>

1601
01:20:23,821 --> 01:20:26,089
<i>It looks like the Democrats
delivered their caucus</i>

1602
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,292
<i>and the Republicans
so far have not.</i>

1603
01:20:28,293 --> 01:20:30,527
<i>What do you think they could do
to change the bill</i>

1604
01:20:30,528 --> 01:20:32,429
<i>to get a few Republican votes
over to the other side?</i>

1605
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,231
<i>If they hang
Wall Street CEOs,</i>

1606
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:35,666
<i>I think that would get
a few more votes.</i>

1607
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:37,467
<i>You know, I'm not...
I'm not sure</i>

1608
01:20:37,468 --> 01:20:39,369
<i>what they could do
exactly.</i>

1609
01:20:39,370 --> 01:20:42,773
<i>It is possible that the leadership
of the Congress would conclude</i>

1610
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:45,777
<i>that there's nothing that can
get a majority of support</i>

1611
01:20:45,778 --> 01:20:48,662
<i>and see what Hank Paulson can do
and the administration can do...</i>

1612
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:52,516
<i>Leaders are negotiating
right now</i>

1613
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:54,751
<i>who'll risk their seats.
And that's what I'm hearing.</i>

1614
01:20:54,752 --> 01:20:57,308
Pelosi wouldn't have brought
the bill to the floor if she

1615
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:58,486
didn't think it would pass.

1616
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:00,091
<i>I don't know the answer
to that, Charlie. I can't answer.</i>

1617
01:21:00,092 --> 01:21:02,093
<i>I'm just reading an email
that's coming to me.</i>

1618
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:03,497
<i>I think the bottom line</i>

1619
01:21:03,498 --> 01:21:04,629
<i>is they gotta go back
to the drawing board.</i>

1620
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:06,330
<i>Do they have the time
though to do that?</i>

1621
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:08,063
<i>Look at the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.</i>

1622
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,998
<i>Well, you know,
you're gonna get a...</i>

1623
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,133
<i>At this point we just</i>

1624
01:21:11,134 --> 01:21:12,535
<i>gotta hold on to the sides
of the kayak</i>

1625
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:14,001
<i>and ride through this
because...</i>

1626
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,969
<i>They didn't pass it.</i>

1627
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:18,004
<i>- They did not pass it.
- It just wasn't enough.</i>

1628
01:21:18,005 --> 01:21:22,207
<i>They're gonna end up being
nine votes short, Bill.</i>

1629
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,908
<i>Say that again, Steve.</i>

1630
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:25,842
<i>I think they're gonna end up
being nine votes...</i>

1631
01:21:25,843 --> 01:21:28,110
<i>if they get all six...
five of the remaining votes,</i>

1632
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:32,013
<i>they'll be 10 votes short now...
if they get all five remaining.</i>

1633
01:21:32,014 --> 01:21:33,747
<i>The writing is
on the wall there.</i>

1634
01:21:33,748 --> 01:21:35,915
<i>And we're here
down on the floor.</i>

1635
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:38,400
<i>Traders have been standing around.
We're all here in knots.</i>

1636
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:46,196
The networks are waiting for you
in the press room.

1637
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:49,349
I can't even...

1638
01:22:01,114 --> 01:22:03,148
We have to
go back again.

1639
01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:05,768
They don't get
to say no on this.

1640
01:22:06,519 --> 01:22:08,187
Okay.

1641
01:22:08,188 --> 01:22:09,356
The White House
wants a meeting.

1642
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:11,358
Good. We'll come up
with a new strategy.

1643
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,427
The White House has to
push harder on the Hill.

1644
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:16,296
Meanwhile we need to keep working
on what we do with the money.

1645
01:22:16,297 --> 01:22:17,798
Let's act like
this is gonna work.

1646
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,632
In that case, let's talk
about cash injections.

1647
01:22:19,633 --> 01:22:20,869
Here we go again.

1648
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,201
We can't nationalize
the banks.

1649
01:22:22,202 --> 01:22:23,298
It's not nationali...

1650
01:22:23,299 --> 01:22:24,869
That's how Japan got itself
a decade-long recession.

1651
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:27,371
Is that where
we want to go?

1652
01:22:27,372 --> 01:22:29,573
What else do we have?

1653
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:31,132
Cash-for-trash.

1654
01:22:31,133 --> 01:22:33,183
Buying toxic assets
is still our go-to move.

1655
01:22:33,811 --> 01:22:37,280
All right.
Find a way to simplify it.

1656
01:22:37,281 --> 01:22:40,184
Dan, work something up.

1657
01:22:40,185 --> 01:22:43,438
For discussion purposes,
let's see what it would look like.

1658
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:57,003
For those who supported the
$700 billion Wall Street bailout,

1659
01:22:57,004 --> 01:22:59,239
it was a surprising
and stunning failure

1660
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,574
when the House of Representatives
voted to reject it.

1661
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:04,043
<i>It's a stinging defeat
for President Bush</i>

1662
01:23:04,044 --> 01:23:06,781
<i>delivered at the hands
of his fellow Republicans.</i>

1663
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:10,251
We put forth a plan
that was big

1664
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:12,019
because we've got
a big problem.

1665
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,957
The reality is that we're
in an urgent situation.

1666
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:19,227
and the consequences
will grow worse each day

1667
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:20,695
if we do not act.

1668
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,196
I know.
I keep telling...

1669
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:23,698
draft of
the new bill.

1670
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,333
Are they having
any luck with it?

1671
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,903
The White House thinks they
got a better shot of pushing it

1672
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:30,506
through the Senate side first.
Hopefully they're right.

1673
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,474
They asked us to back off
and let them handle it.

1674
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:35,529
So I'm... I'm...
I'm trying to back off.

1675
01:23:40,418 --> 01:23:43,287
Buying toxic assets
isn't gonna work.

1676
01:23:43,288 --> 01:23:44,888
Why not?

1677
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:46,455
It's too slow.

1678
01:23:46,456 --> 01:23:47,923
I think I've been
saying that.

1679
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:49,924
Well, we knew it was complicated,
but how slow...?

1680
01:23:49,925 --> 01:23:51,426
Two months,
maybe more.

1681
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,834
Oh.

1682
01:23:52,835 --> 01:23:54,195
How is it possible
we didn't know how...?

1683
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:58,465
I didn't ask how long
it would take, okay?

1684
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,834
Can we move on?

1685
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:04,638
So maybe we can talk about
capital injections.

1686
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,540
Dan, we really can't.

1687
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,709
I think
we're gonna have to.

1688
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,245
Even if neel could
expedite the process,

1689
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:14,815
which seems unlikely,

1690
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,817
<i>the system
is crumbling.</i>

1691
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,553
<i>The banks need
money now.</i>

1692
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:23,090
If cash injections are the most
efficient way to stabilize them,

1693
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:26,259
then we can't back off

1694
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,261
because we're uncomfortable
being the men

1695
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:30,597
who nationalized
a few American banks.

1696
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,266
It's faster,
that's for sure.

1697
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:34,368
It will push us back
off the precipice, yes,

1698
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,972
unfreeze the system.

1699
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:40,741
We give them some money

1700
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:44,194
and they lend it out.

1701
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,416
The motion is adopted.

1702
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,785
After rejecting the Bush
Administration's T.A.R.P. Plan

1703
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:54,422
only four days ago,
the House passed it today.

1704
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,283
The big question now...

1705
01:24:56,284 --> 01:24:58,126
whether investors will take
comfort in the news.

1706
01:24:58,127 --> 01:25:00,128
<i>Current indicators show
the stock market</i>

1707
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:03,315
<i>is continuing
its freefall.</i>

1708
01:25:21,519 --> 01:25:22,885
<i>Hello.</i>

1709
01:25:22,886 --> 01:25:25,221
Warren, it's Hank.

1710
01:25:25,222 --> 01:25:28,324
I... I... I'm sorry.
It's late.

1711
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:30,661
Am I waking you?

1712
01:25:30,662 --> 01:25:33,130
<i>No, not at all.</i>

1713
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:35,299
Can I pick your brain
for a minute?

1714
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:38,101
<i>Sure.
What's the problem?</i>

1715
01:25:38,102 --> 01:25:41,272
How do you get
a healthy bank...

1716
01:25:41,773 --> 01:25:44,791
to accept
a capital injection?

1717
01:26:38,665 --> 01:26:41,167
I had to drag my ass
all the way here from California.

1718
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:43,102
They wouldn't even
tell my why.

1719
01:26:43,103 --> 01:26:45,004
Nobody knows
what this is about?

1720
01:26:45,005 --> 01:26:47,256
Nope.

1721
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:53,980
Talk to Jamie?

1722
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,250
Yep. He'll be fine.

1723
01:26:56,251 --> 01:26:58,119
Did you tell him
what was coming?

1724
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,255
Uh, did I tell him we're about
to make him swallow

1725
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:03,625
a capital injection
he doesn't need? No.

1726
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:06,328
I... I told him
we need his help

1727
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:09,916
and I asked him very politely
not to fuck with us today.

1728
01:27:11,135 --> 01:27:12,619
He got it.

1729
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:15,989
She's here.

1730
01:27:20,813 --> 01:27:22,814
Gentlemen.

1731
01:27:22,815 --> 01:27:24,584
We think this is
gonna work?

1732
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:27,103
Oh yeah.
They're gonna love it.

1733
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:51,047
We are of the view

1734
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:53,050
that the United States
needs

1735
01:27:53,051 --> 01:27:55,752
to take strong,
decisive action

1736
01:27:55,753 --> 01:27:58,921
to arrest the stress

1737
01:27:58,922 --> 01:28:02,457
in our financial system.

1738
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:05,526
Through our new
T.A.R.P. Authority,

1739
01:28:05,527 --> 01:28:08,495
Treasury will purchase

1740
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,764
preferred stock

1741
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:13,849
in each of the banks
represented in this room.

1742
01:28:16,035 --> 01:28:18,503
<i>That stock will yield 5%
the first five years,</i>

1743
01:28:18,504 --> 01:28:21,472
<i>9% after that.</i>

1744
01:28:21,473 --> 01:28:24,174
We give you money;
You lend it out.

1745
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:27,610
It will unfreeze credit,
stabilize the banks,

1746
01:28:27,611 --> 01:28:29,512
restore confidence.

1747
01:28:29,513 --> 01:28:31,613
<i>Everyone will be
better off</i>

1748
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:33,648
with more capital
in the system.

1749
01:28:33,649 --> 01:28:35,716
And that is why

1750
01:28:35,717 --> 01:28:39,586
all nine of you

1751
01:28:39,587 --> 01:28:42,605
will participate
in the program.

1752
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:47,727
Some of us don't need
any capital.

1753
01:28:47,728 --> 01:28:50,231
You all need capital.

1754
01:28:50,232 --> 01:28:52,800
You have no idea what the
market's gonna look like in a year.

1755
01:28:52,801 --> 01:28:54,902
Neither do you.

1756
01:28:54,903 --> 01:28:56,903
I'm not one of you
New York guys

1757
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:58,872
with your
fancy products.

1758
01:28:58,873 --> 01:29:01,775
Well, why am I in this room
talking about bailing you out?

1759
01:29:01,776 --> 01:29:05,378
The stronger banks will serve
as cover for the weaker banks.

1760
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:08,014
If just some of you take it,
the money is a signal

1761
01:29:08,015 --> 01:29:11,117
that a bank is too weak to survive.
The market will devour it.

1762
01:29:11,118 --> 01:29:13,853
How much are we
talking about?

1763
01:29:13,854 --> 01:29:16,940
$125 billion.

1764
01:29:18,927 --> 01:29:20,928
<i>Bank of America...
$15 billion.</i>

1765
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:23,264
<i>Bank of New York Mellon...
$3 billion.</i>

1766
01:29:23,265 --> 01:29:26,800
<i>Citigroup...
$25 billion.</i>

1767
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:30,137
<i>Goldman Sachs...
$10 billion.</i>

1768
01:29:30,138 --> 01:29:33,474
<i>J.P. Morgan...
$25 billion.</i>

1769
01:29:33,475 --> 01:29:35,743
<i>Merrill Lynch...
$10 billion.</i>

1770
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,278
<i>Morgan Stanley...
$10 billion.</i>

1771
01:29:38,279 --> 01:29:41,448
<i>State Street...
$2 billion.</i>

1772
01:29:41,449 --> 01:29:43,934
<i>Wells Fargo...
$25 billion.</i>

1773
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:53,327
What happened
to buying toxic assets?

1774
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:54,929
Wasn't that the idea?

1775
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:56,464
<i>It's too slow.</i>

1776
01:29:56,465 --> 01:29:58,566
You'll be dead
before we sort it out.

1777
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:02,002
So we're just handing
the reins over to you?

1778
01:30:02,003 --> 01:30:03,670
The deal's actually
pretty good.

1779
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:06,340
You turn your nose up at this now,
and we have to rescue you later...

1780
01:30:06,341 --> 01:30:08,141
the terms won't be
nearly as attractive.

1781
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:10,811
It's cheap capital.
It's not the worst idea in the world.

1782
01:30:10,812 --> 01:30:12,779
Well, it is for those of us
who already have capital.

1783
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,916
We will be nonvoting
shareholders.

1784
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,568
This will be
a temporary measure.

1785
01:30:19,855 --> 01:30:22,022
What if we decline
to be involved?

1786
01:30:22,023 --> 01:30:25,593
The Chairman of the FDIC
is sitting right there.

1787
01:30:25,594 --> 01:30:27,294
<i>Tomorrow you'll
find out</i>

1788
01:30:27,295 --> 01:30:29,697
<i>that you're not as well-capitalized
as you think you are.</i>

1789
01:30:29,698 --> 01:30:31,699
What kind of protections
can you offer on changes

1790
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,333
for compensation policy?

1791
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:36,203
I mean, if the government
is going to become a part-owner,

1792
01:30:36,204 --> 01:30:38,205
does that mean
that the government

1793
01:30:38,206 --> 01:30:40,774
is going to dictate
compensation?

1794
01:30:40,775 --> 01:30:43,011
Are you asking me about your
bonus right now, John?

1795
01:30:43,012 --> 01:30:45,380
I'm running
a company.

1796
01:30:45,381 --> 01:30:47,382
If the Fed tells me
I can't offer

1797
01:30:47,383 --> 01:30:49,684
competitive pay
for talent,

1798
01:30:49,685 --> 01:30:52,887
you're gonna launch the biggest brain
drain this country's ever seen.

1799
01:30:52,888 --> 01:30:54,755
Is that the way you want
to run the banks?

1800
01:30:54,756 --> 01:30:56,790
Until the money is repaid
to the Treasury,

1801
01:30:56,791 --> 01:31:00,259
there will be some limitations on tax
deductions and golden parachutes.

1802
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,327
- Well, there you go.
- I don't really understand

1803
01:31:02,328 --> 01:31:04,962
why there needs to be
so much tension about this.

1804
01:31:04,963 --> 01:31:06,931
The country is facing

1805
01:31:06,932 --> 01:31:09,466
the worst economy
since the Great Depression.

1806
01:31:09,467 --> 01:31:11,969
If the financial system
collapses,

1807
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:15,022
it will take
every one of you down.

1808
01:31:23,079 --> 01:31:25,430
Give me the papers.

1809
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:34,320
- You can't just sign it.
- Oh no?

1810
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,989
- Not without your board.
- My board's on 24-hour notice.

1811
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,259
I think they'll
go along with it.

1812
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:45,012
And if they don't,
they'll fire me.

1813
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:53,222
Anyone else?

1814
01:31:58,147 --> 01:32:00,565
Are they gonna do it?

1815
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,352
They're calling
their boards.

1816
01:32:03,353 --> 01:32:05,855
- That's a good sign.
- If they do go along with this,

1817
01:32:05,856 --> 01:32:08,558
we should announce
something alongside the injections...

1818
01:32:08,559 --> 01:32:11,629
maybe a program
to buy up mortgages.

1819
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:13,365
I'm not rushing out
some half-assed plan

1820
01:32:13,366 --> 01:32:15,167
just to make it look like
we're doing something.

1821
01:32:15,168 --> 01:32:17,604
Maybe we just beef up
the restrictions

1822
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:20,374
on how they
spend the money...

1823
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:22,210
something to take
the stink off.

1824
01:32:22,211 --> 01:32:25,030
Put more restrictions on it...
they won't take it.

1825
01:32:29,486 --> 01:32:31,972
One thing too many
for today.

1826
01:32:33,993 --> 01:32:35,961
They almost bring down

1827
01:32:35,962 --> 01:32:37,797
the U.S. economy
as we know it,

1828
01:32:37,798 --> 01:32:40,299
but we can't put restrictions
on how they spend

1829
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:43,536
the $125 billion
we're giving them,

1830
01:32:43,537 --> 01:32:47,890
because they might not
take it.

1831
01:33:19,273 --> 01:33:21,540
What's this?

1832
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:25,377
That is, um...

1833
01:33:25,378 --> 01:33:27,913
A poison dart frog.

1834
01:33:27,914 --> 01:33:31,400
Wendy took it
in Guyana.

1835
01:33:43,664 --> 01:33:46,416
Is this yours?

1836
01:33:51,005 --> 01:33:53,489
Al Capone's.

1837
01:33:55,442 --> 01:33:56,976
Eight out of the nine
are in.

1838
01:33:56,977 --> 01:33:59,012
B of A is still waiting
on its board, but...

1839
01:33:59,013 --> 01:34:01,548
it's gonna go through.

1840
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:04,184
<i>I'll call the Speaker's
office.</i>

1841
01:34:04,185 --> 01:34:07,221
And we're gonna get you
on the phone with the President.

1842
01:34:07,222 --> 01:34:10,174
<i>Okay.</i>

1843
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:15,796
Dow is up 900 points

1844
01:34:15,797 --> 01:34:18,315
just because
we were meeting.

1845
01:34:20,468 --> 01:34:24,505
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

1846
01:34:24,506 --> 01:34:27,074
That's good.

1847
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,809
It was the right thing.

1848
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:32,747
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1849
01:34:32,748 --> 01:34:34,716
I was prepared
for more blowback.

1850
01:34:34,717 --> 01:34:37,819
They didn't have
a choice.

1851
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:40,338
They knew that.

1852
01:34:41,657 --> 01:34:46,428
Well, I certainly hope
that they...

1853
01:34:46,429 --> 01:34:47,846
What?

1854
01:34:49,565 --> 01:34:53,802
I hope they use the money
the way we're asking them to.

1855
01:34:53,803 --> 01:34:58,890
They will... lend it out,
won't they?

1856
01:34:59,976 --> 01:35:02,828
Of course they will.

1857
01:35:14,457 --> 01:35:16,208
Of course they will.
