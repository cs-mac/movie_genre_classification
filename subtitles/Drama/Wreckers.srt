1
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:20,889
Fly.

2
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,204
Fly.

3
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,990
You're beautiful, are you? Yes, you are.

4
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:37,191
- That's my boy.
- Is that a smile? Is it?

6
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,805
Found it on the beach, walking by.

7
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:23,349
- Did ya?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:27,802
- Yeah. Many years in the family.
- How long have you had it?

9
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:29,114
Since I was five.

10
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:31,779
It's amazing.

11
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:34,721
You're joking!

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:43,561
My lads said...they do a beautiful dance,
fertility dance. And they had babies.

13
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,503
Here you go. I was told to keep it warm.

14
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:07,678
Well, we should have the results in a couple of weeks.

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,313
Brilliant.

16
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,032
Hi.

16
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:09,533
Hi.

17
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:12,911
Eh, sorry, my husband is not here. He's...

18
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:13,960
Trying to build it, eh?

19
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,033
Are you one of his students?

20
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:35,337
Think the right look, huh?

21
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,332
- Oh, you're Nick! Oh, hi.
- So I exist.

22
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,318
Yeah, I know, of course. I just
wasn't expecting you, I'm Dawn.

23
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:44,969
I thought I'd drop by.

24
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,585
Oh, I'll let him know.

25
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:49,858
Hey, let's make it a surprise.

26
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,576
Oh no, I think I should.

27
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:54,038
Oh, go on then.

28
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,047
Thanks.

29
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,162
Oh. No, he's gone into a class.

30
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:11,660
Do you want to...bring your stuff in? Come in.

31
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,516
- It's a bit of a bomb site.
- I feel like I'm home

32
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,307
I'll take down my things, shall I?

33
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,462
We had no idea you were coming.

34
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:47,438
We're not really...set up for guests yet.

35
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,710
Oh, don't bring her too close to
the hen hutch. She's not trained yet.

36
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,190
She's a-a reject dog. She was abandoned by her owners.

37
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:15,131
Reject...

38
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,899
Yeah.

38
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:18,961
You wanna put up some tar in there.

39
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,365
Hi!

40
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,043
Fucking hell.

41
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,485
Been on a sunbed, then?

42
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:52,626
I tried to call.

43
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:57,199
- How the fuck did you know I'd be here?
- Dog returns to his shit.

44
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,008
He's not very refined.

45
00:06:06,268 --> 00:06:07,190
So, what do you think?

46
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,000
It's lovely.

47
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,029
- Yeah.
- It's lovely.

48
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,276
- It'll be beautiful.
- Beautiful, yeah.

49
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:19,922
Got all you want then?

50
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,903
This is from my family.

51
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:28,798
It must be hard out there.

52
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,016
You must miss home.

53
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:42,812
Oh, fuck those glasses.

54
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:45,593
I know they're here somewhere. We
haven't really had the time to...

55
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:49,822
Shame I was away..

56
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,393
- Oh. It-It was kind of low-key.
- Yeah?

57
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,394
- It was only a register office.
- How did he behave?

58
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,789
Oh, well. He wasn't found shagging one
of my bridemaids in the toilet, were you?

59
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,453
Get back to the chopping, missus.

60
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,359
She's changed you.

61
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:03,767
- Huh!
- You got all posh.

62
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,769
Marriage is a constant process of negotiation.

63
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,866
Yeah-Yeah. We sing in our chains.

64
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,297
How's Sam?

65
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:17,039
Grand. She's-she's grand.

66
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,161
- And the kid?
- Dylan?

67
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,879
Yeah, he-he's a bundle of fun.

68
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:24,968
Not mine, by a previous.

69
00:08:25,857 --> 00:08:27,705
God, how do they cope with all the coming and going?

70
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:29,868
They don't.

71
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:36,651
Thank you.

72
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,741
- Well...cheers.
- Cheers.

73
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,213
- Hmm.
- Lovely to have you.

74
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,844
So you didn't buy the farm, then?

75
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,081
Ah, it's a wreck.

76
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:29,864
Tell me.

77
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,286
Your brother's a joke, huh?

78
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:34,967
Why haven't we seen him?

79
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:36,351
He's been in the army.

80
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,089
And?

81
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,417
He pushed our Mum down the stairs when he was a teenager.

82
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:46,456
My God.

83
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:49,168
Why?

84
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,383
Well, she could be a bit...

85
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,601
a bit verbal.

86
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,868
Still.

87
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,973
I burned my Mum with curling tongs when I was sixteen.

88
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:08,231
And it wasn't entirely an accident.

89
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,031
She took me to a psychiatrist.

90
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,932
Yeah, well. Our Mum ended up in the hospital.

91
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:11,436
- David!
- Yes.

92
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,985
You hungry?

93
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:45,369
Yeah? Huh.

94
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:49,693
Eggs. Orange, then.

95
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:50,939
Something...

96
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:52,970
Morels.

97
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,747
You wanna take that back to bed, yeah?

98
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,201
What?

99
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,722
I want a baby.

100
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,000
Be patient.

101
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:30,499
What's this all about?

102
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,688
- You buggered it in your sleep.
- You were sleepwalking.

103
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:36,519
Oh, shit.

104
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,916
Shit, I haven't done that for a while.

105
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,550
What, bugger a lettuce?

106
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:42,999
Oh, thanks.

107
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,868
Maybe it's because you're able to relax..

108
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,441
Maybe. Do feel relaxed.

109
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:47,875
Yeah, don't relax too much.

110
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:54,731
When we were little...David and his mates,
they made me a little obstacle course.

111
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:57,325
How'd you know? You were asleep! Dawn, what you have to do

112
00:13:57,676 --> 00:14:00,636
- is talk really quietly, don't alarm...
- So I sleepwalked into the pond.

113
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:06,821
Get some breakfast.

114
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:10,385
I'm all right in here, thanks.

115
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:55,713
I don't know whether we should've
gotten that claim...what we're doin'.

116
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:58,620
- Carefully, that still has life in it.
- What sort of life?

117
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,864
David! My God! David! David!

118
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:04,706
You...

119
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,779
I can't believe you did that!
It's not funny! It's not funny...

120
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:53,728
So how long is it since you've...been back home?

121
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:57,044
Well, about six years since I've been back in these parts.

122
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,448
How come you and David haven't been in touch?

123
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:08,136
Davy was making his way in London...
and he got kind of lost, didn't he?

124
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:25,524
Oh I love this sound. God. Fucking hell!

125
00:16:26,274 --> 00:16:27,570
- Hello, mate!
- Hi!

126
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:31,502
- Back from the dead, eh?
- I can fucking sort you out, mate, I'm bigger now.

127
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:34,881
Now watch out for this one, Dawn.

128
00:16:36,017 --> 00:16:38,026
So you've grafted for Sharon's dad now?

129
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:42,467
Married her. He's dead...thank Christ.

130
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,681
Don't tell her I said that, eh, Dawn?

131
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:53,044
- You want one, Nick?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

132
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,199
Thank you.

133
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,355
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

134
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:00,704
Thanks. All right, Miss Grate?

135
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,161
These are for you.

136
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:05,636
- Ohh, ah-ah.
- Ah, what

137
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,850
It's not bad. I'll tell you about being bad.

138
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,809
Number two, The Hastings.

139
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:13,879
Cathy Histen hang herself...

140
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,567
nobody found her for a week...

141
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,665
nobody gave a fuck about Cathy Histen.

142
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,956
Number 3, The Hastings. Jacky Gross,

143
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,237
beat his wife for twenty years.

144
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:24,948
But he wasn't a bad boy because he did all the

145
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,272
football scores on the radio when he was driving the buses.

146
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:32,151
Oh, goody, the old Forge! Now that's come up in the world.

147
00:17:32,472 --> 00:17:35,311
They used to have all...cobwebby windows

148
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,787
and have, like, a horses hoof, right down there.

149
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,107
He was having sex with his daughter.

150
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,512
He was. Everybody knew about it.

151
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:49,366
Homely. Ha-ha, Homely.

152
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,132
She had three kids and she drown herself

153
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,531
and two of them in the quarry pond.

154
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:55,788
Don't know what happened to the other, poor little sod.

155
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,955
I met an evil spirit in this church, aye, when I was seven.

156
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,528
- You did not.
- I did.

157
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:11,239
Made me what I am.

158
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,250
That and the army.

159
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,524
That'll ward 'em off...the spirits.

160
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:22,567
Sweet to the sweet. Hm-hm.

161
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:23,349
Go on.

162
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,057
Have a good day.

163
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,265
We all know the first line, OK?

164
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:38,410
So when I count to one, two, three,
I want you all to come in together.

165
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,251
I want the front line and the
back line to come in together, OK?

166
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:46,889
Tell me.

167
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,919
He's so full-on, he's funny.

168
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:05,689
You tell me.

169
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,562
One of my students is cutting herself.

170
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:11,976
How do you know?

171
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,620
She told me.

172
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,450
It's a shame, she's a bright kid.

173
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,423
You have to report it.

174
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:25,862
I don't want to get her into trouble. With her family, I mean.

175
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:29,895
- You have to tell someone, David, it's a law.
- Yeah.

176
00:19:30,813 --> 00:19:33,150
Social services. Bit of a mixed bag.

177
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,102
She trusts me.

178
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:05,200
- I can't believe he hasn't brought you here.
- We did pass by, once.

179
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,199
- When did David leave?
- When he was seventeen.

180
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:09,867
God, it's a wreck.

181
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:12,756
- Which one was yours?
- The one just around the front.

182
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,547
- How often have you dreamt about it?
- I've dreamt about it, all right.

183
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:24,450
Watch out.

184
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:30,418
I left some...old tobacco just...here.

185
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:34,189
Will you look at that. Oh my God,
it's been there since I was fifteen.

186
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,908
- Aw, you can tell.
- Hmm.

187
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:41,233
So what was it like...

188
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,291
you and David down on the farm?

189
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,450
Mixed bag.

190
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:53,234
My grandpa, he had these big shire horses,

191
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:57,451
they were fucking huge! But really gentle. Hm.

192
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:04,211
Yeah.

193
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,767
Thanks for, um, for looking after.

194
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:10,253
I appreciate it.

195
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:13,072
- Obliged.
- No worries.

198
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,108
It's-It's Nick. And Dawn, here.

199
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,455
I'm not blind.

200
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,098
You got a big old star for geography. You know that.

196
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:45,434
- Hey, stranger!
- Wow! Fancy that! How you doin'?

197
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:47,254
- All right.
- Hey, Dawn.

198
00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,914
- Hi!
- You okay?

199
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,341
- Yeah.
- Hi, Miss Hedges!

200
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:55,191
- Say, you won any medals yet?
- Yeah, the Purple Heart.

201
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,070
Ohh. I just gotta...

202
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,550
They spit in the food.

203
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,726
- I'm sure they don't.
- You'll see.

204
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:12,772
So how were they? When you were teaching them.

205
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,575
The Johnson boys!

206
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:18,394
Flamey brats.

207
00:22:20,244 --> 00:22:21,632
Poor little chaps.

208
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,450
Sometimes you can't help them even if you want to.

209
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,152
Their father beat them.

210
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:35,055
Flack-fleck-giddley-geck.

211
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,925
Not that you could see anything.

212
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:41,899
David never told me.

213
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,540
Where is he?

214
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:48,287
I like clever boys!

215
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:18,350
- But you have been torturing her.
- What?! I...she used to torture us!

216
00:23:18,351 --> 00:23:20,329
Oh, the poor old pretty, she hasn't
got any kids to look after her.

217
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,667
Oh, that's what kids are for!

218
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,767
- Remember Mister Dixon?
- Sure!

219
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:27,885
He used to beat the crap out of us. Well,the lads, that is.

220
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,150
- Out of you, you mean.
- Yeah, because I took the rap for Davy.

221
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:31,947
Why?

222
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:33,316
What did you do?

223
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:36,461
He was always the one there when everyone else turned and ran.

224
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:39,687
It was always him standing, saying, "What?!
It wasn't me! It wasn't me! I didn't do it!"

225
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:41,667
'Till they sent you away.

226
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,971
He had his spell in Bostle.

227
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,339
- Ten years ago, Dawn.
- Oh, give or take.

228
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,087
Far from the prying eyes of the state.
Banged his head against the wall.

229
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,301
Yeah, that's why I work looking after troubled kids.

230
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:01,089
Ahh! That's why I joined the fucking army.

231
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:14,516
Hey, remember that time you...held my head in
the water trough? I tell you, I almost choked.

232
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:17,290
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

233
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,193
- Where was David?
- I remember that..

234
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:21,570
I don't know, elsewhere.

235
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,767
- Huh!
- You nicked my girlfriend.

236
00:24:24,177 --> 00:24:29,245
I...nicked your girlfriend? I was thirteen,
how could I nick your girlfriend?!

237
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:29,976
You looked at her.

238
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,767
I looked at her?! Fuckin' hell, they taught me all I know.

239
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:38,739
On that same day, I was dancing around my handbag,
and somebody all scrawny, little scruffy...

240
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,724
- Me?
- Feller comes up to me, i.e. you, Nick...

241
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:45,021
and starts giving it the big-in coming on to me and then

242
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:47,249
Mister Trustworthy here,

243
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:50,978
older lad, comes up and saves me, i.e. Gary.

244
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,422
You know they forced me to do that?

245
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:57,614
You Johnson boys! Oh, nothing but problems.

246
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,555
Yeah, well, that's all over now.

247
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:08,626
Marriage is just so restful, isn't it,
Dawn? You don't have to choose anymore.

248
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,733
- Hello.
- Well, if you didn't laugh, you'd cry, eh?

249
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:21,107
Miss Hedges told me about your dad. That he beat you.

250
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:24,981
Who's that, Dad? He used to fuck us up the ass, eh?

251
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:28,316
He's too much.

252
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:31,432
- Well, you wanted him to stay.
- Did I?!

253
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:33,848
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,698
Not here, Dawn. All right, mate, can
I have, eh, one more gin and tonic, please?

255
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,204
Oh, my God!

256
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:46,608
Shhh, come in.

257
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,164
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

258
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:55,089
- You go on!
- No, I can't, cause Gary won't like it.

259
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:57,244
Oh, my God!

260
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,899
Blimey, love!

261
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:03,719
Here.

262
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,436
Be careful, don't rip it.

263
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:22,376
- She lent me this, Davy boy!
- Right. Ahh.

264
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:25,405
Come on, guys, out of the way.

265
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:30,883
...must go and you must bide.

266
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:39,033
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow...

267
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:39,675
Shocking!

268
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:46,665
And we'll come back before...the valley's...with snow...

269
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:52,593
And be you here in sunshine or in shadow...

270
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:53,467
Wah-wah!

271
00:26:54,101 --> 00:27:00,771
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so.

272
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:06,441
Painful!

273
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:32,005
- Dave, I hear someone in there.
- Hmm?

274
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:34,364
Think there's someone in there.

275
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:38,303
- There is! There is, David, look!
- All right, all right.

276
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:40,399
Look! Dave, there's somebody in here!

277
00:27:40,872 --> 00:27:42,663
- There's somebody in there, Dave, look!
- All right.

278
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,338
Come out! Come out!

279
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:45,925
Nick?

280
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,065
It's over, my mate, I know what was in there!

281
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,714
When-when he got out of tank, he was all on fire, Dave!

282
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,068
- He was burning!!!
- Nick?

283
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:58,518
I pulled away, but then I tried to save
him. I was like, "Where's the fire brigade?"

284
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,176
"Where are they?", I was saying.
But it...there was nobody there!

285
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:07,104
I tried to put it down, I jumped on top of it, like that.

286
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,167
Burnt right through, I couldn't save him!

287
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:10,767
- You're all right.
- Look!

288
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:12,481
- Look at me, look at me.
- Look, no!

289
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:15,409
It's all right. It's all right. Look at me.

290
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:53,637
Don't.

291
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,471
Is he all right?

292
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:05,791
Poor Nick.

293
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,580
Why didn't you tell me about your dad?

294
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:23,938
Because I don't want to think about it. Because...

295
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,896
he was full of hate, self-hate.

296
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:32,042
Because I hate him.

297
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:38,168
Why did we come here?

298
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:43,174
Because I wanna do some good in
the place that my dad was a tosser.

299
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:48,371
- Do you really like the country side?
- You're the one with the chickens.

300
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:52,381
- David...
- I love you.

301
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:54,959
Why has he come back?

302
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,223
I used to hold him.

303
00:30:00,187 --> 00:30:01,617
That's all, I mean, you saw!

304
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:04,271
He likes it.

305
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:34,303
He needs help.

306
00:30:36,841 --> 00:30:37,933
You can't help Nick,

307
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:40,250
can't save him.

308
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:54,395
Hello?

309
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:01,973
Nick.

310
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:06,010
Have you thought about talking to someone?

312
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,601
You know, about your experiences.

313
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,189
We think you need professional help.

315
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:16,713
We?!

316
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:20,855
There's no shame in going off on one,
you know.  Well, I could talk to someone.

317
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:24,152
- We all need help.
- You may do.

318
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,169
And you.

319
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:47,974
"I opened the door and I was suddenly in a-a ruined city."

320
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:51,278
"It looked as it-as it was bombed.

321
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:55,003
"The ground was hot ash with dead
bodys scattered everywhere..."

322
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,423
Take a break, have a look at this.

323
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:59,430
If it's one body, it is "the body" without the "S".

324
00:31:59,943 --> 00:32:03,115
And if it's plural, you put "ies" in
there, and that makes "the bodies".

325
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:05,530
But that's brilliant, you've done that really,
really well. Want to read on from there.

326
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:10,150
"The building-the buildings were all smashed to pieces..."

327
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:29,719
So what do you know about professional help?

328
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:36,033
I was mugged, in London.

329
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:38,463
David weighed in, that's how we met.

330
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:42,054
- I had some counselling after that.
- Hmm.

331
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:44,647
Well, he likes a barney.

332
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:46,955
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

333
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:49,080
I've no seen him fight except that one time.

334
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,930
What was it like? Really?

335
00:32:59,752 --> 00:33:00,926
Better than sex.

336
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:10,111
It's...um...um...

337
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:16,238
it's like there's one of me...out there, fightin'

338
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,104
and one of me here, um...and I can't ...

339
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:25,512
quite, um, make the two, um...

340
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:29,704
I know.

341
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,488
I can't have on record, see, that's-that's-that's the trouble.

342
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:10,097
OK. Eh, can we just do guys,

343
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:12,110
just the beginning. Actually, I
just wanna hear them first of all.

344
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:52,618
- Dawn! All right?
- Yeah.

345
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:54,369
- You walking?
- Yeah!

346
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,248
How you finding it?

347
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:06,083
Well...it's a big old church.

348
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:09,167
- It's beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

349
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:11,380
Those angels are famous.

350
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:12,825
- Really?
- Yeah.

351
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:17,386
Churches make me feel sad somehow.

352
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,626
- Yeah?
- Huh.

353
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:20,194
Why?

354
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:16,076
Wait for me to come and save you, do you remember?!

355
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,996
You frightened me earlier.

356
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,488
Sorry.

357
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:29,407
He gets to me sometimes.

358
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:38,556
I hardly know you, do I?

359
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,761
- We're trying for a baby.
- Nice.

360
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:49,689
Yeah, well, it's taking its sweet time.

361
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,788
Nick one. I'll do it for you.

362
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,184
I was stolen, well, adopted.

363
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,440
- Really?
- Hmm.

364
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,036
Well, worked out well, as far as I can see.

365
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:08,341
They're dead now. They were older.

366
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:13,536
I miss them. Like you never really, eh...

367
00:37:23,818 --> 00:37:25,558
We got shot up, my mistake.

368
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:27,664
In the dark.

369
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:30,770
I couldn't see.

370
00:37:32,564 --> 00:37:34,060
- Ha!
- David!

371
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,234
How'd you know we were here?

372
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,960
Dog returns to its shit.

373
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:41,730
I should've called down, he just...turned up.

374
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,295
- You seen enough?
- It's a wreck, innit?

375
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:38,052
- Nick. Nick. Nick, Nick! It's a dream.
- I'll hold you.

376
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:40,076
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

377
00:38:40,077 --> 00:38:41,821
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
- Nick!

378
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:43,739
- It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
- Nick.

379
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:47,392
- It's all right...it's all right, Nick.
- Huh? Why?

380
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,212
What's happened?

381
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:31,369
That was wide open. He must've left it open in his sleep.

382
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,150
You did that!

383
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,380
Why would I open the hen hutch?

384
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:43,066
You know, it's just like when you killed your rabbit!

385
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,287
He left the hutch opened in the middle of the night,

386
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:47,350
let the dogs out, all in his sleep, when he was a kid!

387
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,872
You did that, you opened the hutch
door and you blamed it on me,

388
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,550
- you killed her!
- You bed-wetter!

389
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,710
- You little shit!
- Stop it!

390
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:01,811
Dawn.

391
00:40:02,689 --> 00:40:03,498
Dawn.

392
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:05,820
Dawn!

393
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:07,534
Dawn!!

394
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:11,490
Dawn!!!

395
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,726
You Johnson boys.

397
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:53,992
Bring 'em here.

403
00:40:58,037 --> 00:40:58,644
Thanks.

398
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:11,972
Should we get rid of him?

399
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:14,501
Where to?

400
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:15,939
Got mates?

401
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:17,550
What about an ex?

402
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,038
David...

403
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:32,752
Did you let the dog into the hen hutch?

404
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:36,353
Sorry.

405
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:42,347
I was only joking.

406
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,195
Oh, So. Can you stand, please?

407
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:45,087
You awake now?!!

408
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:52,725
Dave, I'm sorry. Dave! I'm sorry!

409
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:54,061
- Don't.
- Dave!

410
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:55,290
- Don't.
- Dave!

411
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:55,825
Don't!

412
00:42:57,881 --> 00:42:59,495
Get up. Get up!

413
00:43:01,531 --> 00:43:05,389
You want it, do you? You want
her, do you? Do you? You want it!

414
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:24,781
I'll pay for that.

415
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:38,372
Why did you leave me the house?

416
00:43:53,775 --> 00:43:54,895
Sorry about last night.

417
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:34,185
That looks good. Mind if I have a slice of that?.

418
00:44:34,678 --> 00:44:37,182
- You made it, you cut it.
- Oww.

419
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,044
- Who wears the trousers in that house?
- She does.

420
00:44:41,323 --> 00:44:44,263
This one's the one that, eh, his
brother had competition. Well...

421
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,165
he just made those, right?

422
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,014
Is it-Is it like like Robin Hood? Can we, eh...

423
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:53,386
- Light in his hand, like by Robin Hood.
- Just shut up.

424
00:44:53,387 --> 00:44:56,365
- Do you think we should go away end of term?
- Yeah, we could.

425
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,385
We got a house in Spain.

426
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:02,550
Come there to us.

427
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:05,500
- It's an idea.
- I'll come to Spain.

428
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,479
Yeah, it's a shame you're leaving, Nick.

429
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,493
We have farewell party on Saturday.

430
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:17,059
Don't have much of a house, we got a hell of a barbecue.

431
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,964
Ohh. Gonna miss you, Nick.

432
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,550
Know when your time's up.

433
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:45,391
Yeah, Gary wants another kid.

434
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:49,675
Well, I just feel too young, and-and I love all this.

435
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,179
You know, having a laugh and just being able to have a drink.

436
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,635
You know, 'cause my Mum's not gonna be around forever.

437
00:45:56,229 --> 00:46:00,399
And she can handle one, but hav-having to have two, I...

438
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:05,825
And I-I don't want my tits sagging to the ground. Ohhh!

439
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:09,319
- And here's the biggest one of them all.
- Biggest one of whom all, who's that?

440
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:10,519
Kids!

441
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:12,376
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you.

442
00:47:41,635 --> 00:47:43,105
Me, going to battle.

443
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:46,372
Must have your flak jacket.

444
00:47:54,268 --> 00:47:55,780
I wish you were coming to hear me..

445
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:58,550
Sod's law.

446
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:02,620
No.

447
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,803
- No!
- Bit funerial?

448
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:08,467
Yeah.

449
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:10,886
- What about this one?
- No!

450
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,977
- Dazzle, Bobbie Dazzle.
- No, none of them.

451
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:14,463
You're lovely as you are.

452
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,459
- Where was Sharon tonight?
- Not her thing.

453
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:46,246
- David?
- PTA.

454
00:49:48,831 --> 00:49:50,505
- I'll take this.
- Oh, thank you.

455
00:49:51,686 --> 00:49:52,791
Oh, sorry.

456
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,074
- All right.
- Thank you.

458
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:57,595
- OK?
- Hmm.

459
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,120
No!

460
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,003
Stupid. Sorry.

461
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,576
It's all right. Uh, thanks for walking me home.

462
00:50:12,853 --> 00:50:13,550
Dawn!

464
00:50:37,529 --> 00:50:39,081
I think you need a wash, anyway.

465
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:41,065
You need to have a wash?

466
00:50:41,862 --> 00:50:42,792
What'd you say, eh?

467
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:46,550
It's a hard thing being a teacher but
it's a hell of a lot harder being pupil.

468
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:57,526
It's not  a closed book by any means.

469
00:50:57,742 --> 00:51:00,684
In the first instance, you need to
come back here for a second test to

470
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:03,203
- make sure it isn't just a-a blip.
- It's not a blip.

471
00:51:03,877 --> 00:51:04,746
I'm sorry?

472
00:51:06,555 --> 00:51:07,916
It's a...it's...

473
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:13,280
it's not a blip, um...I-I had a previous girlfriend who was...

474
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:16,554
trying for a baby and, eh...

475
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:47,339
Stop crying.

476
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:52,756
It's my fault, stop crying.

477
00:51:54,466 --> 00:51:55,667
Why didn't you just say?

478
00:51:57,098 --> 00:51:59,147
You kept pushing it, your-your little project,

479
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:01,550
I mean, why couldn't we just waited for a couple of years?!

480
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:08,197
- I was afraid it was me!
- Well it's me, happy now?

481
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:10,856
Christ!!!

482
00:52:11,936 --> 00:52:12,827
I could've guessed.

483
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,116
I'm gonna walk home.

484
00:52:17,452 --> 00:52:18,666
Dawn, please.

485
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:21,550
Please don't leave me. I wouldn't
be much without you, but...Ow!

486
00:53:43,646 --> 00:53:44,496
Hello?

487
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:48,206
Dawn!

488
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,444
Hello?

489
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:56,560
It's Gary.

490
00:56:06,582 --> 00:56:07,512
Oh, God.

491
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,158
So...so sorry!

498
00:56:19,465 --> 00:56:20,356
Oops.

492
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,952
- I'll take the dog for a walk.
- Go on, then.

493
00:56:32,573 --> 00:56:33,733
Come on, Judy.

494
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,297
Well, thanks for making the bed.

495
00:56:44,117 --> 00:56:45,872
Less of the chatter, please.

496
00:56:47,006 --> 00:56:48,379
Right. Make sure you get into a line.

497
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,127
Thomas, Ann, will you stop talking, please. Thank you.

498
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:53,812
Nadir and Sinead, will you please be quiet!

499
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:56,256
You've got to do this in a week and none of you prepared, OK?

500
00:56:56,257 --> 00:56:57,608
You need to start paying attention.

501
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:48,867
David.

502
00:57:51,526 --> 00:57:52,550
I want to get through this.

503
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,929
- We can have everything, have a whole life.
- Yeah, but you really want a child.

504
00:58:00,737 --> 00:58:02,193
How do you know what I want?

505
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:07,713
It was years, so we should go to the doctor.

506
00:58:09,522 --> 00:58:11,480
You lied about how long we've been trying.

507
00:58:13,206 --> 00:58:13,975
You lied.

508
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,644
Oh God, I'm so ashamed.

509
00:58:23,313 --> 00:58:26,553
David...I love you.

510
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,573
I want you to be happy.

511
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,339
- David.
- You go.

512
00:59:15,279 --> 00:59:16,371
I don't wanna. You go, Dawn.

513
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:21,056
You go try.

514
00:59:58,267 --> 00:59:59,415
I'm awake.

515
01:00:05,975 --> 01:00:07,246
I was just admiring them...

516
01:00:18,945 --> 01:00:19,512
Nick.

517
01:00:54,312 --> 01:00:55,546
Hi, honey, how are you?

518
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:59,042
Hi, little one, how are you?

519
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:35,194
She's sad, that's all. She can't have kids.

520
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:38,216
- What?!
- Yeah. David told me.

521
01:01:43,183 --> 01:01:44,098
Ah, Dawn.

522
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:46,448
Oh. I'm sorry.

523
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:54,281
It's him who can't.

524
01:02:00,936 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, come here. I'm sorry.

525
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:08,684
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

526
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:26,972
Hello?

527
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:30,790
I know, it was a Sunday.

528
01:02:30,791 --> 01:02:31,330
Yeah.

529
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:33,855
We're trying to help you daughter, so...

530
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:38,490
So you looking forward to going back?

531
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:42,628
Say hello to the Taliban?

532
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,920
Blow up a few more childs, eh?

533
01:02:50,551 --> 01:02:51,212
Here, catch.

534
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:54,612
Oh! Oh, my God!

535
01:02:54,613 --> 01:02:55,737
- Come here, come here.
- Is she allright?

536
01:02:55,843 --> 01:02:58,394
- Someone, show me. Somebody get me some ice.
- April, don't go now.

537
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,187
She all right?

538
01:03:05,722 --> 01:03:08,692
A hot coal on me, David, you should get this fucking nut...

539
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,952
All right, Dawn? Need some help?

540
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,945
- Thank you.
- Who you gonna fuck next, then?

541
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,487
You all right, darling? Do you want some help?

542
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:50,864
- Daisy?
- Yes, please.

543
01:03:50,865 --> 01:03:53,640
- Daisy?
- David! Give us the ball.

544
01:03:56,636 --> 01:03:57,322
Watch this.

545
01:03:57,674 --> 01:04:00,765
Hey, soldier boy! Catch!

546
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:04,461
He used to pay me to beat you up, did you know that?

547
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:05,936
What? What you gonna do?

548
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:11,306
Stop it!

549
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:15,447
Remember when you did this to me, eh?

550
01:04:15,454 --> 01:04:18,550
- Do you remember when you did this to me?! EH?!
- David, stop it!

551
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:21,995
Baby, come here.

552
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:27,406
I fucked your wife.

553
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:31,414
Gary!

554
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,831
- Gary, please.
- Get off me.

555
01:04:35,856 --> 01:04:37,352
Don't look at me like that, Dawn.

556
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:39,700
I'm the sane one!

557
01:04:40,976 --> 01:04:42,967
He pushed our Mum down stairs!

558
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,087
- Nicki.
- Fuck me!

559
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,968
Old Mum, eh. Gave her something to think about.

560
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:55,123
David! David!!! No! David!!!

561
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,107
Oh yeah, sure, we'll be in...

562
01:06:41,903 --> 01:06:43,144
that's fine, thank you.

563
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:53,213
He's gone AWOL.

564
01:06:54,846 --> 01:06:56,803
- Did he tell you he was gonna run away?
- No.

565
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:01,559
- Has he been in touch, David?
- No.

566
01:07:05,467 --> 01:07:09,083
- He dropped by this summer but we
weren't that close since our parents died.

567
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:12,090
Well...

568
01:07:14,345 --> 01:07:18,356
we, eh...We think he might have mental health problems.

569
01:07:38,536 --> 01:07:40,871
- Think he'll come back?
- How should I know?

570
01:07:46,851 --> 01:07:50,239
- You would tell me.
- He'll come to you.

571
01:07:56,794 --> 01:07:59,008
Why did you lie to me about him
pushing your Mum down the stairs?

572
01:08:06,191 --> 01:08:07,567
She was hurting him.

573
01:08:10,368 --> 01:08:11,570
I was protecting him.

574
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,985
Missed you. Yeah, I did, I missed you.

575
01:09:47,561 --> 01:09:49,531
No, don't go. Don't go, don't go.

576
01:09:49,862 --> 01:09:52,123
Don't go, don't go. Don't go.

577
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:53,749
Please don't go.

578
01:09:55,866 --> 01:09:57,107
All right, I stink.

579
01:09:59,308 --> 01:10:01,994
I went to London but I couldn't...hack it.

580
01:10:04,856 --> 01:10:05,811
Do you want a biscuit?

581
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:08,129
Eh?

582
01:10:09,593 --> 01:10:11,954
Go on. Go on, have one.

583
01:10:13,385 --> 01:10:14,937
They come from the back of the service station.

584
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:21,333
I've let all my mates down.

585
01:10:25,615 --> 01:10:28,938
I just can't...sleep.

586
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:30,745
I just can't.

587
01:10:34,745 --> 01:10:35,743
How's Davy?

588
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,065
I have to know...

589
01:10:40,037 --> 01:10:40,954
about you two.

590
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:44,333
Well, he loves me.

591
01:10:54,405 --> 01:10:57,233
Davey...looked after me, yeah?

592
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:00,475
'Cause of Dad...

593
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:04,834
but he, kind of...

594
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,225
owned me.

595
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:18,963
That's not love.

596
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:25,619
He fucks you...but he loves ME!

597
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:27,192
He hates you!

598
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,644
You have to go.

599
01:11:33,805 --> 01:11:34,885
I'll bring you money.

600
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:38,219
Where could I go?!

601
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,961
If you love him, you'll leave us!

602
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,763
- Where you going?
- To choir.

603
01:12:04,137 --> 01:12:05,055
Drop you if you like.

604
01:13:01,897 --> 01:13:02,680
Nick?

605
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,280
Where were you?

606
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:31,650
I was worried about you.

607
01:14:32,577 --> 01:14:33,562
Where is he?

608
01:14:35,369 --> 01:14:37,421
- Where is he?
- Dawn?

609
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:02,121
She'll need to get plenty of rest. 

610
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,693
- So, we'll keep her for now.
- Thank you.

611
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:23,763
Dawn...

612
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:27,868
They say the baby is safe.

613
01:15:49,983 --> 01:15:51,427
I didn't want to hurt you.

614
01:15:58,494 --> 01:16:00,072
I want this child.

615
01:16:03,556 --> 01:16:05,013
I want you to be happy.

616
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:19,726
Nick came back.

617
01:16:20,657 --> 01:16:21,520
I saw him.

618
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:24,231
I know.

619
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,040
I know.

620
01:17:35,358 --> 01:17:36,362
- This is little Ben.
- Little Ben.

621
01:17:36,363 --> 01:17:37,833
- I know.
- Ben.

622
01:17:37,834 --> 01:17:38,853
- Well...
- Hello.

623
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,914
- Ohh.
- Oh, he's lovely.

624
01:17:43,411 --> 01:17:44,577
You must be proud.

625
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:46,174
Yeah.
