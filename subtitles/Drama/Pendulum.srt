1
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
- Yes?
- I wish to see don Medina.

2
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,400
- My name...
- I'm sorry.

3
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,520
Don Medina is not receiving
visitors at present.

4
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,680
You will announce that
Mr. Francis Barnard...

5
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,760
has come from England
to see him.

6
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,040
What do you think you're doing?

7
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,200
Remove your hand, sir.

8
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,600
Maximillian.

9
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,080
What is it?

10
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,960
This gentleman demands
to be admitted, Dona.

11
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,920
- I've told him...
- You are Dona Medina?

12
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I am.

13
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,440
I am Francis Barnard,
Elizabeth's brother.

14
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,340
Won't you come in, Mr. Barnard?

16
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,520
Please forgive me.
I'm Catherine Medina.

17
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,740
Dona.

18
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,840
Would you not spend the night
Mr. Barnard?

19
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,760
I am certain
my brother would wish it.

20
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,620
Perhaps Dona. May I see your
brother now?

21
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,400
He is resting.

22
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,160
He has not been well
since the death.

23
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,920
I see. When may I see him?

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Perhaps at supper...

25
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,160
if you will do us the honor.

26
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,500
I will... supper.

27
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,240
May I visit my sister's
grave, now?

28
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
Grave?

29
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,160
I presume there is one.

30
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,920
Not as such, Mister Barnard.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,500
She is interred below.

32
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,480
A family custom, Mr. Barnard.

33
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,540
I see.

34
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,940
If we may go there then?

35
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,060
Please follow me.

36
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,600
When did she die?

37
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Your brother's letter made
no mention of the day.

38
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,280
About three months ago.

39
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,560
Three months? Why wasn't I
notified sooner?

40
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,520
I'm afraid I...

41
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,840
How did she die?

42
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,420
I know very little of the
details, Mr. Barnard.

43
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,160
This is no longer my home,
you see?

44
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,960
I left it several months before...

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,640
Nicholas married
your sister.

46
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,060
Meaning you don't even...

47
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,100
Damn Heaven.

48
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,460
What's that noise?

49
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,460
Please follow me, Mr. Barnard.

50
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,260
Not that way, Mr. Barnard.

51
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,480
Who are you?

52
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,040
This is Mr. Barnard, Nicholas.

53
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,500
Elizabeth's brother.

54
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,980
Oh, yes.

55
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,960
You are welcome, mister.

56
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,400
Resting, dona Medina?

57
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Sir?

58
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,160
I told Mr. Barnard
that you were resting, Nicholas.

59
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
I thought that you were.

60
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,940
That noise, sir.

61
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
This is an apparatus...

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,900
that must be kept
in constant repair.

63
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,400
What brings you to us?

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,320
Elizabeth was my sister,
don Medina.

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,240
I received your report
of her untimely death...

66
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
the report that was
utterly devoid of detail.

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
What should I have done,
remained in England?

68
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes, you are quite right.
My apology, sir.

69
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Shock and grief...

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,720
restrained me from
more adequate communication.

71
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,640
You have every right
to be provoked.

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,760
Perhaps you will show me my
sister's place of interment now.

73
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,860
I told him it would be
alright, Nicholas.

74
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,980
Yes, of course.

75
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,480
Now perhaps you'll be good enough
to tell me how my sister died.

76
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
In the illness of
some duration, sir.

77
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,160
And was this illness diagnosed?

78
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,080
- Yes.
- By whom?

79
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,560
Dr. Leon, the physician
of repute.

80
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,300
And he decided?

81
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Something in her blood.

82
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,060
Yes?

83
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
That's all?

84
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,620
Just something in her blood?

85
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm afraid so.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,940
And I'm afraid that does not
satisfy me, sir.

87
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,820
Follow me.

88
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
May we go now, Mr. Barnard?

89
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,000
This is very painful
for my brother.

90
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,180
And for me... as well.

91
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,960
This form of burial...

92
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,060
is our family custom,
Mr. Barnard.

93
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,100
Will you stay the night
with us?

94
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,800
The night...

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,260
and more, sir.

96
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,500
Until I know exactly
what has happened to her.

97
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,980
Thank you.

98
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
Yes?

99
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,000
I trust that you will be
comfortable here.

100
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,900
Is this you?

101
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
No.

102
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,040
No, that is my father,
Sebastian Medina.

103
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,400
Sebastian Medina, yes.

104
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
The resemblance is remarkable.

105
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,500
Yes.

106
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,000
And the other is my
uncle Bartholomew.

107
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,240
Mr. Barnard, I am aware,
painfully aware...

108
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,640
of your distrust regarding
Elizabeth's death.

109
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Her death was, and is,
anguish to me.

110
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,560
I beg of you do not
add to it...

111
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,840
I'm sorry, don Medina, but
your word is not enough.

112
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,200
Too many things need
fuller explanation...

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,000
before I can be satisfied
that what you say is true.

114
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,580
Fuller explanation?

115
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,980
Yes.

116
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,140
Come with me.

117
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,580
Please, come.

118
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,300
The atmosphere is heavy in here.

119
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,360
Why have you brought me here?

120
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,920
It is her room, sir.

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,700
I've had it kept exactly
as she left it.

122
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,580
Look around you sir.

123
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
This room was furnished and
arranged with dedicated love.

124
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,680
Every article of furniture
every decorative detail...

125
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
is the work of a master
craftsman...

126
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,440
of Italy, of Spain or France.

127
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,080
Indeed every country in the civilized world...

128
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,600
is represented here.

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,300
It is unique room.

130
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
I did it all for her.

131
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,380
I wanted her to have something that...

132
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,440
Maria

133
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,160
I beg your pardon, sir.

134
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
I was just cleaning up.

135
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,940
Oh, yes, yes of course.

136
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,740
You may go now.

137
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
Is this all you
meant to tell me?

138
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,560
You are an unyielding man,
Mr. Barnard.

139
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
I am forced to be, sir.

140
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,920
God is my witness
I worshipped your sister

141
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,480
I worship her still.

142
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,600
Without her, life
is meaningless.

143
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,500
She was that substance of
loveliness.

144
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
I tried to capture it...

145
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,640
but it was the way she walked
and moved...

146
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
her smile, her voice.

147
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,580
She sang like an angel.

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,760
And she could play
the harpsichord...

149
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,180
as no other woman I've
ever known could play.

150
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,660
Every night after we
have dined...

151
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,700
she would play for me.

152
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,320
Please, forgive me.

153
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,340
I have not intended to so
display myself.

154
00:13:24,937 --> 00:12:51,760
I pray...

155
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,640
I pray...

156
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,020
I pray you leave me for awhile.

157
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,540
Please, go.

158
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,180
Do you live in London, Mr. Barnard?

159
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,240
Yes, and you?

160
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,000
In Barcelona, with an aunt.

161
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,040
And have you been here long?

162
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,800
A little over a week.

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
I came to be with
Nicholas because I...

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,300
Who would that be?

165
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,200
Nicholas.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,960
How are you, my friend?

167
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,360
You look pale.

168
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,440
Slept badly, have you?

169
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,280
Charles, we have a visitor.

170
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Well, splendid, splendid.

171
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,200
- Exactly what you need.
- Charles.

172
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,140
It's Elizabeth's brother.

173
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,500
- You mean...
- Yes.

174
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,240
Dr. Charles Leon
at your service, sir.

175
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,280
Doctor.

176
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,040
You are I understand it
Elizabeth's brother.

177
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
The resemblance is clear.

178
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,000
The coloring, the same
configuration.

179
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,880
Beautiful woman your sister.

180
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
- Doctor.
- Ah, dear.

181
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,040
I interrupted your meal, I see.

182
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,200
Proper timing was never my
fault.

183
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,880
We have just finished. Won't
you join us in a glass of wine, Charles?

184
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,500
Delighted.

185
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,520
So, young gentleman, you've come
all the way from England, then?

186
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,560
That's right.

187
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,520
Terrible tragedy your
sister's death.

188
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,840
Appalling business.

189
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,440
How are things in Baztan, Charles?

190
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,920
What?

191
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,880
Always, always, Nicholas...

192
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,160
buying and selling
living and dying.

193
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,820
The weave of life.

194
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,400
Why did my sister die,
Dr. Leon?

195
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,960
Have you not been told?

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
- Of course he has.
- Well then?

197
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,460
I want to hear it from you doctor.

198
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,520
Her death was inevitable,
I fear...

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,080
under the circumstances.

200
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,280
This castle, this odious atmosphere.

201
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,120
What has the castle to do with it?

202
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,960
What has the castle...?

203
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,960
It's too late now, Charles.

204
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,760
I did not want him to know.

205
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,540
Know what?

206
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,560
Your sister's death was caused
by failure of the heart, sir...

207
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,800
due to total shock.

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
Literally, she died of fright.

209
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,400
- Why did you not tell me?
- I thought to spare you, sir.

210
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
You thought to deceive me.

211
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,960
- That is not true.
- What is all this?

212
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,620
Show me where it happened.

213
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,040
- Very well.
- No, Nicholas.

214
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
There is no other way, my dear.

215
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,640
We were wrong, very wrong to have
kept the truth from Mr. Barnard.

216
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,720
Now we are doubly suspect
in his eyes.

217
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,200
Suspect?

218
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,860
Come.

219
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,240
Nicholas, you should not be
doing this, you know.

220
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,920
- You are not well.
- It cannot be avoided, Charles.

221
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,700
Come.

222
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,340
Well?

223
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,320
Torture chamber?

224
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,560
Yes, Mr. Barnard.

225
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,280
It was my father's.

226
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
Sebastian Medina.

227
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,880
One of the inquisition's most
infamous, degrading...

228
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,200
- Sir, that is enough.
- Mr. Barnard, can you not see?

229
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,420
What was my sister doing here?

230
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,580
She could not keep herself away.

231
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,720
That noise I heard, is
that what was...

232
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
No, sir. That particular device...

233
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,520
was not in operation
at the time.

234
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,480
Which device?

235
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,500
It's in the adjoining chamber
down there.

236
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
Please, Mr. Barnard, do not
go there...

237
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,640
I do not wish to discuss it.

238
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,360
The story, sir.

239
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,540
In detail.

240
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
This was my father's world,
Mr. Barnard.

241
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,560
Spare yourself at least
this, Nicholas.

242
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,880
How can I spare myself?

243
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,280
Was he not my father?

244
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,040
Am I not the spawn of his...

245
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,120
his depraved blood?

246
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,240
His depravity is not
yours, Nicholas.

247
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
Why scourge yourself
because of it?

248
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,680
You have not answered me, don Medina.

249
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,320
I shall not dwell upon the
history of this...

250
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,440
this blasphemous chamber.

251
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Suffice it that the blood of a
thousand men and women...

252
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,440
was spilt within these walls.

253
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
Limbs twisted and broken.

254
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
Eyes gouged from
bloody sockets...

255
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,880
flesh burned black.

256
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,400
Why are you telling me these things?

257
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,780
What do they have to do with
my sister?

258
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
She had never been brought here.

259
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,440
She was too sensitive,
too aware.

260
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,520
Aware of what?

261
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,200
The malignant atmosphere
of this castle.

262
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
It destroyed her.

263
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,840
My sister was a strong and
willful woman...

264
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,340
not subject to the influence
of atmospheres.

265
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,120
You have been here only
a matter of hours, Mr. Barnard.

266
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,360
You cannot know what it is
to live here...

267
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,200
month upon month,
year after year...

268
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,520
breathing this infernal air...

269
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,200
absorbing the miasma
of barbarity...

270
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,280
which permeates
these walls...

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,080
particularly this chamber.

272
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,100
But it did not bother her
at first either.

273
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,960
Our life was good...

274
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,140
rich with the shared
pleasures of our love.

275
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,860
Each morning I would bring
her breakfast.

276
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,480
In the afternoons, she usually sat
for me while I attempted all in vain...

277
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,680
to capture her beauty on canvas.

278
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
I did that portrait which you saw
on her room before...

279
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,340
but it is all inadequate to what I
called the loveliness of her.

280
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,080
We dined, sometimes alone,
enjoying intimate conversation...

281
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,260
sometimes with the doctor.

282
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,580
And every night
Elisabeth would play for me.

283
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,800
Life was simple, quiet,
richly pleasurable...

284
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,780
and then the darkness
began to fall.

285
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,480
More and more entering her room
in the mornings...

286
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,640
I would find her awake and discover
that she had not slept all the night.

287
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,340
I tried to find out why,
but she had no explanation.

288
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
Her appetite began to fade.

289
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
She began to lose weight
and color.

290
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,520
I tried to make her eat...

291
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,300
but something kept her from it.

292
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,360
I would come upon her wandering
in the corridors at night.

293
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,440
I tried to find out
what was wrong...

294
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,760
but she never had an answer...

295
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,160
except to say that...
that something was oppressing her.

296
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,240
Oh God, help me for my blindness.

297
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,740
I should have known...

298
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,640
Then one day she disappeared.

299
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,460
Frantic, I searched the castle for her.

300
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,200
And then I knew.

301
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,540
The castle and its awful history
had obsessed her.

302
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,400
These very instruments of torture...

303
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,960
which were my birthright
and my curse...

304
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,760
now tormented her as well...

305
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
infecting her with a kind of
haunted fascination.

306
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,240
And watched her drawn to one
and then another...

307
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
as if the aura of pain
and suffering which surrounded them...

308
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,600
was luring her to sickness...

309
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,740
and to death.

310
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,360
Immediately I made my plans
to leave the castle with her.

311
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,200
We would travel for a while,
restore her spirits...

312
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,260
and then make our home elsewhere.

313
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,640
Then on the very eve of
our departure...

314
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,320
we heard her scream from below...

315
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,120
the most hideous blood-chilling
scream...

316
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,940
I have ever heard
in my life.

317
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,440
Just before she died,
she whispered a name.

318
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,120
Sebastian.

319
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,300
Sebastian.

320
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,740
Mr. Barnard.

321
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,280
Dona.

322
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,640
May I speak with you?

323
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,480
Yes, of course.

324
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,240
How is your brother?

325
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,180
Better, thank you.
Dr. Leon is staying with him.

326
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,520
I have come to ask you
to please believe him, Mr. Barnard.

327
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,220
He has told you the truth.

328
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,120
Has he?

329
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,880
Yes. And not telling you before...

330
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,860
he only meant to spare you pain.

331
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,760
He is a good man, Mr. Barnard...

332
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
a kind and gentle man...

333
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,820
and I know that he adored
your sister.

334
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,960
I would like to believe him,
Dona Medina...

335
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
but I find it very difficult
to do so.

336
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,760
There is something about him
I cannot help at sense...

337
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,880
kind of fearful tension that...

338
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,960
I am sorry...

339
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,960
but an air of
definite guilt.

340
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,520
Of course he suffers from guilt
Mr. Barnard...

341
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
because of what our father did...

342
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
because of what happened to
Elizabeth.

343
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,120
Perhaps it will help you
to understand...

344
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,120
if I tell you something
that happened to Nicholas...

345
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,040
when he was just a boy.

346
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,400
One day, while Nicholas was
playing...

347
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,820
in a lower corridor...

348
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
He had been forbidden by
our father...

349
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,260
to enter this chamber at any time.

350
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,920
The curiosity of youth, however...

351
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,400
overcame his fear of challenging
our father's discipline.

352
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,140
He had to see the chamber.

353
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,100
Suddenly, there were footsteps.

354
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,660
It was our father.

355
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,960
With him were our mother
and our uncle Bartholomew...

356
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,380
who was our father's brother.

357
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,760
At first it appeared that for
some inexplicable reason...

358
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,800
our father was actually...

359
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,340
conducting them on a tour of
his ghastly chamber.

360
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,800
Nicholas could see that both
our mother and our uncle...

361
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,040
were uneasy, frightened.

362
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,640
Our father's smiling affability...

363
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,800
as he described the workings
of these hellish instruments...

364
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,840
turned Nicholas' blood cold.

365
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,600
He watched them with a mounting
sense of premonition.

366
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,160
Something was wrong, most
terribly wrong.

367
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
Even he, no more than
10 years of age...

368
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,920
could sense it like a
darkening vapor in the air.

369
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,640
There was no reason...

370
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,820
for our mother and our uncle
to have been there.

371
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,840
As he struck, he kept on
screaming at his brother...

372
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,640
one word, over and over.

373
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,080
"Adulterer. Adulterer."

374
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,780
And then he turned on her.

375
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,560
Accusing her of vile debauchery
with his brother...

376
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
cursing her as faithless...

377
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,400
promising her the
agonies of hell...

378
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,960
and payment
for her infidelity...

379
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,320
and then before my brother's
very eyes...

380
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,660
our mother was tortured to death.

381
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,640
Ever since then...

382
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Nicholas has been unable to live
as other men.

383
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,480
Always he is haunted by the memory...

384
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,080
of that terrible day..

385
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,240
Your sister's death...

386
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,080
came very close to driving,
him insane, Mr. Barnard.

387
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,320
I beg of you...

388
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,160
have pity on him.

389
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,740
Help him by believing him.

390
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,180
I will try, dona Medina.

391
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,560
Well, I know you must be very
tired from your journey.

392
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,120
Good night.

393
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,180
Dona.

394
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,360
Who is that?

395
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,740
I'll see.

396
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Where's Nicholas?

397
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,560
He is gone?

398
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,600
I must have dozed off in
that chair...

399
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,660
and I heard...

400
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
I don't understand.
It is surely your brother.

401
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,940
No, Nicholas has never played the
harpsichord in his life.

402
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,560
Maria.

403
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,900
I heard the playing, sir.

404
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,380
Go back to bed, child.

405
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,260
Nicholas.

406
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
It was Elizabeth.

407
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,680
You saw her?

408
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,040
I did not have to see her.

409
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,980
I know her playing.

410
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,980
Locked?

411
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,360
Yes.

412
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,440
Is there another door?

413
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,940
There is not, sir.

414
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,260
My sister's?

415
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,980
Easy, easy.

416
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,620
It was she.

417
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,540
Up, take this.

418
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,180
Thank you.

419
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,600
Hers?

420
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,240
Yes.

421
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,720
You will sleep in a minute or so.

422
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,000
Doctor, will you stay please?

423
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,480
Yes, of course, my dear.

424
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,820
Until the morning, at any rate.

425
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,880
My dear Lord.

426
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,880
It is hers, isn't it?

427
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,560
- It is.
- But how?

428
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,200
Let us not talk yet.

429
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,920
May we use your room, sir?

430
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,620
Yes, of course.

431
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,820
Sit.

432
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,280
What I am about to tell you...

433
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,340
no one in this world except
Nicholas and myself knows.

434
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,360
That is, I thought that no one else knew.

435
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,800
Take this.

436
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,880
No, thank...

437
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,180
Drink it.

438
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,280
To be absolutely blunt about it...

439
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Nicholas believes that Elizabeth
may have been interred prematurely.

440
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
What?

441
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,640
I hasten to assure you both...

442
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,520
that such is not the case.

443
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,280
Elizabeth was quite dead.

444
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,160
I would stick my reputation
on that fact.

445
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,600
Then why...

446
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
does he believe it?

447
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,920
Because of what happened to
his mother many years ago.

448
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,960
I'm afraid I don't understand.

449
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,040
I told mister Barnard
what Nicholas saw that day.

450
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,880
No, my dear. Your mother was not
tortured to death...

451
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,160
as you were told.

452
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
But...

453
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,640
She was tortured, yes...

454
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,400
but not to death.

455
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,680
Do I make myself clear?

456
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,560
Do you mean to say that...?

457
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,680
Your mother was walled up in
her tomb while yet alive.

458
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,580
Oh, no.

459
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,640
From that day forth...

460
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,640
the very thought of premature
interment...

461
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,280
was enough to drive your brother
into convulsions of horror.

462
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,560
Nicholas broods about it
constantly.

463
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,120
Already he has told me he has heard
Elizabeth's walking the corridors...

464
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,160
even that he has heard her
speaking his name.

465
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,320
- Dr. Leon.
- Sir?

466
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,720
You seem to forget that we all
heard the harpsichord playing.

467
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,840
No, I have not forgotten that, sir.

468
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,160
It is why I said before that I thought...

469
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,400
that no one but Nicholas and
myself knew about this.

470
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
What do you mean?

471
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,560
Someone, I fear, has discovered
Nicholas' secret...

472
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,400
and is using it as a terrible advantage.

473
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,960
The servant, perhaps.

474
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,580
I could almost more easily believe
that...

475
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,160
That what, Dona Medina?

476
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,120
Nothing.

477
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,980
I spoke without thought.

478
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,880
I want to know one thing, sir.

479
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,600
Are you absolutely positive...

480
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,400
that don Medina's dread is
unwarranted?

481
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,640
If Elizabeth Medina walks the
corridors of this castle...

482
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,820
it is her spirit, not her living self.

483
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,220
- Where did it come from?
- Elizabeth's room.

484
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,820
What is it, child?

485
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,520
Easy, child. Easy..

486
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,900
But tell us what happened to you.

487
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,200
I... I... I heard her.

488
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,880
Heard?

489
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,120
The mistress.

490
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,520
I was cleaning up the room...

491
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,520
and she spoke to me.

492
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,400
She called me by my name, Maria.

493
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,460
She said, "Maria, leave
this room".

494
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,040
My wife spoke to you?

495
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,020
- My wife spoke...
- Nicholas.

496
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,020
No one will ever enter that
room again.

497
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,720
- Mister Barnard, I...
- No need explaining, Nicholas.

498
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,340
Mister Barnard knows everything.

499
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,800
Take care of the girl,
will you Catherine.

500
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,680
I'll see to it, dona Medina, if you
want to go with your brother.

501
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Thank you.

502
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,660
Come, Maria, let me help you
downstairs.

503
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,240
Perhaps I should bring some food
to Nicholas.

504
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,480
He will not eat it, my dear...

505
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,520
any more than you are
eating yours.

506
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,000
I am not hungry.

507
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,840
You need your strength, nonetheless.

508
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,680
If I may interrupt this
fascinating conversation for a moment...

509
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,080
how long, may I ask, you intend
to accept these occurrences...

510
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,920
face value?

511
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,480
I should have thought, mister Barnard
that a man of your investigative zeal...

512
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,760
would have already solved
the mystery.

513
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,160
And have you, doctor?

514
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,720
I am not certain.

515
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,400
But you remember that no one
actually heard Elizabeth's voice?

516
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,520
We have only Maria's word for it.

517
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
We proceed on similar lines, doctor.

518
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,960
On questioning Maria, I asked her to
describe the voice she heard.

519
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,320
- And?
- She could not describe it, doctor...

520
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
because it only whispered to her.

521
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,820
This point seems of vital import
to you, doesn't it?

522
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,100
Don Medina.

523
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,500
Don Medina.

524
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,360
The key to Elizabeth's room..

525
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,780
The key, I said.

526
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,060
Again?

527
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
Do not go there, Nicholas.

528
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,740
I must, Catherine.

529
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,140
Nicholas.

530
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,500
Come.

531
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,960
What I have dreaded all these months...

532
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,000
has come to pass.

533
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,240
You are wrong, Nicholas.

534
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,000
No. She haunts me...

535
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,960
because of the terrible thing
I did to her...

536
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,640
Mister Barnard.

537
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,840
What in the name of heaven?

538
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,080
And have you nothing to say, don Medina?

539
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,400
I don't understand, sir.

540
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,760
Do you not, sir?

541
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,600
Then, with your permission,
I will enlighten you.

542
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,960
What is the meaning of this?

543
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,400
The meaning, doctor, is this:
Only one person in this castle...

544
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,040
could have caused all these inexplicable
occurrences.

545
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,560
That person is don Medina.

546
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
- What?
- You are mad, sir.

547
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,240
Am I?

548
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,040
Mister Barnard, I swear that I...

549
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,280
The secret passage, sir...

550
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,360
how convenient for you.

551
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,040
Enabling you to whisper to
Maria without being seen.

552
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,440
Then after the door to Elizabeth's
room had been...

553
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,360
locked by YOU, enabling you to
return there and...

554
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,120
at your leisure
demolish everything.

555
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,080
- You are wrong, sir. I swear I...
- You are lying, sir.

556
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,240
When Maria screamed, where
were you?

557
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,880
When Elizabeth's room was being torn apart,
where were you?

558
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,780
How you are not
investigating that?

559
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,120
I was afraid.

560
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,800
You lie.

561
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,480
Both times you were in
Elizabeth's room yourself.

562
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,120
Both times your own door
was locked...

563
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,640
protecting you from
discovery.

564
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,560
No, that's not true. It's not true.

565
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,360
Why should Nicholas do these things?

566
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,300
Why.?

567
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,900
Is it possible?

568
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Is it possible I am doing these things
unaware?

569
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,440
To punish myself?

570
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,840
No, Nicholas.

571
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,320
One of the servants was responsible.

572
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,220
Most likely Maria.

573
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,680
Could I have kept that
ring without knowing it?

574
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,840
Play the harpsichord without
knowing it?

575
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,180
Destroy Elizabeth's room
all without knowing it?

576
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,920
My inner mind...

577
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,200
creating evidence of Elizabeth's
vengeful return...

578
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,460
because that mind knows...

579
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,100
But I don't know.

580
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,180
I will find out.

581
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,000
No.

582
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,920
It's the only way, Catherine.

583
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,120
And it's the only way I...

584
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,980
I must be sure.

585
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,400
I must be sure.

586
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,040
Can you not stop this?

587
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,220
I do not believe I wish
to stop it, my dear.

588
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,480
If this is the only way of
convincing Nicholas...

589
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,720
that he did not bury his wife alive then
I say by all means-do it.

590
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,640
This groundless dread...

591
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,620
must finally be put to rest.

592
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,620
We will exhume Elizabeth.

593
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,300
True.

594
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,900
True.

595
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,380
I swear to you I thought she
was dead.

596
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,760
On my honors of physician I
thought she was dead.

597
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,380
I swear to you.

598
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,960
True.

599
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,280
True.

600
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,880
True.

601
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,680
It's true..

602
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,560
No, Nicholas.

603
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,540
It's true.

604
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,780
Nicholas.

605
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,960
I killed her.

606
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,120
I killed her.

607
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,560
No, Nicholas.

608
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,340
I killed her. I killed her.

609
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,740
Nicholas.

610
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,900
I would suggest, Nicholas,
that you leave this place.

611
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,260
Your remaining here cannot
help Elizabeth now.

612
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,800
Try to understand, Nicholas.

613
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,560
I am a doctor of medicine.

614
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,000
Never in my career have I seen a
condition which so completely...

615
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,880
paralleled the physical appearance...

616
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,580
of dead.

617
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,980
You cannot feel responsible, Nicholas.

618
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,640
While we were up here mourning...

619
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,600
and she was alive, struggling
to be free.

620
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,440
I am responsible.
If it were not so...

621
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,120
she would not want to haunt me.

622
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,200
She does not haunt you, Nicholas.

623
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,580
Can you not see that? It is you
punishing yourself.

624
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,360
I must leave in the morning.

625
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,760
Already I have been grossly
negligent...

626
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,320
of my other patients.

627
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,240
I beg of you-leave with me.

628
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,780
I can never leave.

629
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,720
I must accept whatever vengeance...

630
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,820
Elizabeth chooses to inflict upon me.

631
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,860
Dona Medina? Dona Medina?

632
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,960
What is it, Mister Barnard?

633
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,400
May I speak with you?

634
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,880
- Certainly.
- I came to apologize.

635
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,800
Apologize?

636
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,760
But everything you said...

637
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,560
I know that my suspicions were
justified...

638
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,200
but not as I had expected.

639
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,000
I realize now that my sister's death...

640
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,440
was an accident.

641
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,000
I do not blame your brother.

642
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,320
I feel only sympathy for him.

643
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,840
What I did was, I assure you,
only because of Elizabeth.

644
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,060
I think I understand.

645
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,200
I am sorry that our meeting...

646
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,520
should have taken place under
such unhappy circumstances.

647
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,340
Had things been otherwise...

648
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,280
Perhaps we should meet again...

649
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,060
in Barcelona.

650
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,860
I hope so.

651
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,760
Good night, Dona.

652
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,460
Good night.

653
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,640
- Doctor.
- Where are you going, sir?

654
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,000
- To apologize to don Medina.
- I wouldn't speak to him just now.

655
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,560
He is much overwrought.
In the morning, perhaps.

656
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,040
- You will be leaving then?
- Yes.

657
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,880
Will you accept the hospitality of
my carriage?

658
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,840
Thank you, doctor. Good night.

659
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,540
Good night, mister Barnard.

660
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,340
Nicholas.

661
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,140
Elizabeth?

662
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,020
Elizabeth?

663
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,580
Nicholas.

664
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,060
Nicholas.

665
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,820
Elizabeth?

666
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,180
Where are you?

667
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,380
Elizabeth?

668
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,420
Where are you?

669
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,820
Nicholas?

670
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,920
Is my brother with you?

671
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,400
- No. Is he not in his room?
- No.

672
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,540
He must be with Dr. Leon then.

673
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,260
Nicholas.

674
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,600
I will check below.

675
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,440
You two search this floor and
the one above.

676
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,500
All right

677
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,980
Nicholas.

678
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,520
Is that you?

679
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,340
Elizabeth?

680
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,660
Elizabeth?

681
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,820
Nicholas.

682
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,500
Elizabeth?

683
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,220
Elizabeth?

684
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,480
Elizabeth?

685
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,980
Nicholas.

686
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,820
Nicholas.

687
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,540
Nicholas.

688
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,560
I told you to wait.

689
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,900
I couldn't.

690
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,140
He is gone.

691
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,460
What about my brother?

692
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,200
He is supposed to leave in the
morning..

693
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,680
But now...

694
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,740
Why couldn't you wait one more day?

695
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,620
I've waited too long already.

696
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,120
Oh, my darling Nicholas...

697
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,920
we've broken you at last.

698
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,440
Elizabeth, there is no time for this.

699
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,320
I've waited an eternity for this moment.

700
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,800
There has to be time.

701
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,720
And now, my dear Nicholas...

702
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,840
I have you exactly as I want you...

703
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,720
helpless.

704
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,920
Elizabeth.

705
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,560
Is it not ironical, my husband?

706
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,400
Your wife, an adulteress.

707
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,760
Your mother, an adulteress.

708
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,480
Your uncle, an adulterer.

709
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,760
Your closest friend, an adulterer.

710
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,540
Do you not find that amusing,
dear Nicholas?

711
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,420
Yes.

712
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,320
Yes.

713
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,860
Yes.

714
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,040
Yes.

715
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,940
What's happening to him?

716
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,680
Happening?

717
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,080
What should be happening, Isabella?

718
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,260
Isabella?

719
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,480
You, Bartholomew, my brother...

720
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,100
how do you like my little workshop?

721
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,320
Dear God.

722
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,140
What ails you, brother, huh?

723
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,240
And you, my dear, why are you so pale?

724
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,580
Does this place disturb you?

725
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,840
I thought the two of you
would enjoy...

726
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,880
the novelty of it.

727
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,480
Come, let me show you about a bit.

728
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,900
Where are you going, Isabella?
Bartholomew.

729
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,340
Are you leaving me?

730
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,260
Don't you want to see my...?

731
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,600
I am going to torture you, Isabella.

732
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,600
I am going to make you suffer
for your faithlessness to me.

733
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,200
Before this day is out...

734
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,600
you will be begging me to kill you...

735
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,640
to relieve you of the agony of hell..

736
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,820
Into which your husband is about to
plunge you.

737
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,840
Harlot.

738
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,680
You will die in agony.

739
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,340
Die.

740
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,780
Now, Bartholomew, my brother...

741
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,400
Bartholomew.

742
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,540
Bartholomew.

743
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,200
Where are you?

744
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,260
You cannot hide from me, you know.

745
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,960
Don Medina?

746
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,360
Don Medina.

747
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,540
There you are, Bartholomew.

748
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,080
Ah, there you are, sir.

749
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,980
We've been searching all over for you.

750
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,000
And now for you Bartholomew,
my beloved brother...

751
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,000
while you are still alive...

752
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,300
my ultimate device of torture.

753
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,480
Are you ready now, Bartholomew?

754
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,900
Bartholomew?

755
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,900
Now we are ready to begin, Bartholomew.

756
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,720
Do you know where you are, Bartholomew?

757
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,600
Don Medina, I am Francis Barnard.

758
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,800
I will tell you where you are.

759
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,080
You are about to enter hell, Bartholomew.

760
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,960
Hell.

761
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,400
The Netherworld.

762
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,800
The infernal region.

763
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,560
The abode of the damned.

764
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,840
The place of torment.
Pandemonium.

765
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,280
"Abbadon, "Tophet", "Gehenna".

766
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,540
"Naraka", the pit.

767
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,060
And the pendulum.

768
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,100
The razor edge of destiny.

769
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,520
That's the condition of man.

770
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,880
Bound on an island from which
he can never hope to escape...

771
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:30,760
surrounded by the waiting
pit of hell.

772
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,280
Subject to the inexorable
pendulum of fate...

773
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,160
which must destroy him finally.

774
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,560
Nicholas?

775
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,520
Nicholas, are you in there?

776
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,660
Catherine, help me.

777
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,980
Nicholas?

778
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,780
Nicholas.

779
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,880
Maximillian. Maximillian.

780
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,660
We must break into the torture
chamber. Quickly.

781
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,540
Maximillian.

782
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,020
Don Medina-he thought that I was...

783
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,860
It's over now.

784
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,740
Nicholas.

785
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,380
No one will ever enter this room again.
