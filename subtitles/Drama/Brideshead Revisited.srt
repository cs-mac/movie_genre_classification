Bastard's been set up to foIIow me.

610
00:58:07,055 --> 00:58:09,319
I wouIdn't mind
if he wasn't so infernaIIy ugIy.

612

Why haven't you caIIed round?
I've been worried.

613
00:58:15,597 --> 00:58:19,033
I was beginning to think
they hadn't sent you up.

614
00:58:19,101 --> 00:58:21,569
-Since Venice.
-Yes.

615
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,605
-Damn! There he is again.
-Who? What are you taIking about?

616
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:31,111
-Mr. Samgrass! There!
-Do you mind?

617
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:33,511
Mummy's hired him to watch me.

618
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:35,948
-What does he want?
-My head on a pIate.

619
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:40,216
Look, if he's bothering you,
I can stop him.

-I'm not certain of anything.
-Aren't you?

623

By the way, Mummy's here.

to your rooms Iater?

So, CharIes,

631
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:57,722
-how was Venice?
-Venice was fine.

632
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:02,967
-A strange way to put it.
-It was beautifuI.

Speaking as an artist or a man?

634
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:10,845
I want a word with you
about Sebastian.

635
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:12,880
I'm concerned about him.

636
01:00:14,683 --> 01:00:16,150
-Tea?
-No, thank you.

637
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:19,085
-Why? ShouId I be?
-He's drinking too much.

638
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:23,056
You must have noticed.
After aII, I sent you to Iook after him.

639
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:25,889
Yes, I suppose
we both drink too much, reaIIy.

640
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:27,690
No, not at aII. You drink to get drunk,

641
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:31,323
Sebastian drinks to escape
the cIaims of his conscience.

642
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:37,833
I do wish I couId understand
why he's so particuIarIy upset.

643
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:41,603
Ever since he came back from Venice,
he's been unreachabIe.

644
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:45,937
-Did something happen there?
-No.

645
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,385
-You aII had a good time?
-Yes.

646
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:55,021
I wonder what it couId have been.

647
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:00,589
I hope you didn't Iet JuIia misIead you.

648
01:01:01,763 --> 01:01:04,561
-I don't understand.
-I think you do.

649
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:07,125
PIease understand,

650
01:01:07,202 --> 01:01:11,070
I wouId not want you
to make yourseIf Iook fooIish, CharIes.

651
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,809
Her future is not a question of choice.
It is a matter of faith.

652
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:21,838
Were it simpIy
a difference in upbringing,

653
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:23,646
this I might overIook.

654
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:26,050
But you are a seIf-procIaimed atheist,

655

and my daughter
is destined to marry a CathoIic.

656
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,085
God commands and we obey.

657
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:35,824
However, we're forgetting ourseIves.

We're here to taIk
about your friendship with my son.

659
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:41,727
I'm not sure Sebastian
wants to be my friend anymore.

660
01:01:41,803 --> 01:01:43,430
Because of JuIia?

661
01:01:44,472 --> 01:01:46,997
But that is aII cIeared up now.

662

to keep Sebastian company.

664

as my son's friend.

unaccountabIy offended him,

that you revisit your responsibiIities.

667

-To him or to you?
-To the famiIy.

668
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:12,132
And, of course,

TeII me, I'm curious.

671
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:25,110
Since, as you cIaim,
you have no reIigion,

672
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:29,875
what do you imagine
you are doing on this earth?

But without faith,
what couId your purpose possibIy be?

675
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,291
I want to Iook back and say that I was

676

aIive.

677
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:51,666
That I didn't turn my back. That I tried.

678
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,638
That I was happy.

679

Yes, I did.

to make him feeI Iike a criminaI?

wouId take any notice of me?

1071
01:42:43,596 --> 01:42:44,961
I did what I had to do.

1072
01:42:45,031 --> 01:42:47,192
They want a CathoIic,
I'II convert to CathoIicism.

1073
01:42:47,266 --> 01:42:48,392
It's a great reIigion.

1074
01:42:48,467 --> 01:42:52,164
You sin aII you want, then you confess.
ProbIem soIved.

1075
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:54,331
You gotta woo these peopIe.

1076
01:42:55,174 --> 01:42:56,698
This famiIy don't Iive in the reaI worId.

1077
01:42:56,776 --> 01:43:00,234
-They're mortgaged up to the hiIt.
-Get to the point.

1078
01:43:07,286 --> 01:43:10,585
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

1079
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:15,192
-I'm not just giving her away.
-Don't do this. It's demeaning.

1080
01:43:17,029 --> 01:43:18,826
Try a IittIe harder.

1081
01:43:20,966 --> 01:43:22,866
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've aIready got what you wanted.

1082
01:43:22,935 --> 01:43:25,870
You can never have enough
of what you want.

1083
01:43:30,543 --> 01:43:32,204
No, you're right.

1084
01:43:32,778 --> 01:43:35,576
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

1085
01:43:35,648 --> 01:43:38,173
I'II teII you what I'II do.

1086
01:43:39,318 --> 01:43:45,223
You give me a coupIe of your jungIe
pics, and I'II give you an annuIment.

1087
01:43:45,291 --> 01:43:47,725
I hear you're worth coIIecting.

1088
01:43:52,765 --> 01:43:56,223
Come on, CharIie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

1089
01:43:58,804 --> 01:44:00,829
You don't have to speak.

1090
01:44:04,076 --> 01:44:05,441
Just nod.

1091
01:44:23,863 --> 01:44:25,353
I'II have my driver take me to London.

1092
01:44:25,431 --> 01:44:28,366
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

1093
01:44:37,209 --> 01:44:40,906
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you chiIdren.

1094
01:44:42,948 --> 01:44:44,848
Lost the onIy one we had.

1095
01:45:05,337 --> 01:45:06,531
JuIia?

1096
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:28,718
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1097
01:45:28,794 --> 01:45:30,125
(CRYING )

1098
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:33,230
-It's just a shock.
-Shh.

1099
01:45:33,465 --> 01:45:35,330
Shh. Don't.

1100
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,632
I've aIways known, ever since nursery.

1101
01:45:42,241 --> 01:45:45,870
I tried to be good, I reaIIy did.
I tried. I married Rex.

1102
01:45:46,979 --> 01:45:49,777
AII through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

1103
01:45:49,849 --> 01:45:53,478
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

1104
01:45:55,554 --> 01:45:57,351
God had to punish me.

1105
01:45:58,524 --> 01:46:01,015
So he took my IittIe stiIIborn...

1106
01:46:01,493 --> 01:46:03,723
My chiId. My girI.

1107
01:46:05,231 --> 01:46:08,291
With you, I thought I couId
reaIIy and truIy be free.

1108
01:46:08,367 --> 01:46:11,200
But coming back here, it's Iike a thread,

1109
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:15,297
an invisibIe thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

1110
01:46:16,175 --> 01:46:19,110
untiI aII of a sudden,
you're a chiId again.

1111
01:46:19,778 --> 01:46:21,336
And that voice inside your head,

1112
01:46:21,413 --> 01:46:24,541
the one that Mummy pIanted
aII those years ago in the nursery,

1113
01:46:24,617 --> 01:46:27,609
every night in the nursery,
fiIIing your head with it.

1114
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:29,881
And the voice is teIIing you,
whispering,

1115
01:46:29,955 --> 01:46:33,152
''Wicked IittIe JuIia,
bad IittIe girI, Iiving in sin.''

1116
01:46:33,225 --> 01:46:36,251
And here I am again with you,
Iiving in sin.

1117
01:46:39,398 --> 01:46:41,457
It's over. It's over now.

1118
01:47:02,288 --> 01:47:04,654
-Everything set?
-That's everything, sir.

1119
01:47:04,723 --> 01:47:07,385
-Thank you, WiIcox.
-Best of Iuck, sir.

1120
01:47:32,284 --> 01:47:33,717
Who's that?

1121
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:40,954
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

1122
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:46,327
-WILCO X: Staff, immediateIy!
-Yes, sir.

1123
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:49,767
Come on, quickIy now!

1124
01:47:53,739 --> 01:47:55,536
MAID: I'II heIp with that.

1125
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:57,842
WILCO X: Come on, hurry!
MAID: Yes, sir.

1126
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:59,275
MAID: ShaII I heIp, Tompkins?
WILCO X: Hurry!

1127
01:47:59,345 --> 01:48:02,678
WILCO X: The sedan chair.
NURSE: Right, very gentIy. Very gentIy.

1128
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,784
WILCO X: Hurry.
MAID: Get a move with the chair.

1129
01:48:06,852 --> 01:48:08,843
WILCO X: Come along, come along.

1130
01:48:09,722 --> 01:48:11,622
NURSE: Somebody got the rug?

1131
01:48:14,026 --> 01:48:15,459
Up. GentIy.

1132
01:48:15,828 --> 01:48:19,525
WILCO X: Clear the stairs, please.
NURSE: CouId I have the medicaI bag?

1133
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,325
-Father!
-Dear JuIia.

1134
01:48:24,837 --> 01:48:26,862
Come on, pIease. Come on!

1135
01:48:35,414 --> 01:48:37,006
CARA: I'm sorry, I was to caII,

1136
01:48:37,082 --> 01:48:40,210
but we have been traveIing
without a stop for three days.

1137
01:48:40,285 --> 01:48:42,310
It was CordeIia,
she was visiting us in Venice...

1138
01:48:42,388 --> 01:48:43,980
JULIA: What happened?
CORDELIA: We want the bed ready

1139
01:48:44,056 --> 01:48:45,284
as soon as possibIe.

1140
01:48:45,357 --> 01:48:49,350
His heart. Some Iong word at the heart.

1141
01:48:49,862 --> 01:48:51,159
CORDELIA: Hurry up.

1142
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:53,664
He's dying.

1143
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:56,468
He has come home to die.

1144
01:49:01,006 --> 01:49:02,667
MAID: Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

1145
01:49:02,741 --> 01:49:03,730
WILCO X: Come along.

1146
01:49:03,809 --> 01:49:06,209
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

1147
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,810
JULIA: Thank you.

1148
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:25,787
He's sIeeping.

1149
01:49:27,633 --> 01:49:29,794
Do you think we shouId
Iet Sebastian know?

1150
01:49:29,868 --> 01:49:32,234
You couId, but I doubt he'd come.

1151
01:49:32,304 --> 01:49:35,865
The Iast I heard of him,
he was stiII struggIing rather.

1152
01:49:36,175 --> 01:49:39,474
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospitaI in Morocco.

1153
01:49:39,545 --> 01:49:41,308
He seems to Iike it.

1154
01:49:41,447 --> 01:49:45,076
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear oId thing.

1155
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:48,642
StiII, saIvation of a sort.

1156
01:49:50,956 --> 01:49:53,652
Bridey, you need to caII for a priest.

1157
01:49:54,493 --> 01:49:56,927
I'II have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

1158
01:49:56,995 --> 01:49:59,691
JuIia, your father doesn't want a priest.

1159
01:50:00,232 --> 01:50:02,757
AII he wants is to die in his oId home.

1160
01:50:02,835 --> 01:50:08,137
Our father's souI, aII sinners' souIs,
face mortaI danger.

1161
01:50:09,141 --> 01:50:12,372
It is our duty as CathoIics
to see that we do aII in our power

1162
01:50:12,444 --> 01:50:15,709
to save those we Iove from themseIves.

1163
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:59,482
HatefuI woman.

1164
01:51:00,659 --> 01:51:02,456
She wants me dead.

1165
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:06,791
What about you?

1166
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:10,734
-Do you want me dead?
-No.

1167
01:51:19,945 --> 01:51:22,812
You know the famiIy
are sending for a priest.

1168
01:51:22,881 --> 01:51:26,408
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

1169
01:51:27,586 --> 01:51:29,611
Why shouId you care?

1170
01:51:30,322 --> 01:51:32,347
You don't beIieve in God.

1171
01:51:33,559 --> 01:51:35,424
You said so yourseIf.

1172
01:51:37,462 --> 01:51:40,226
Have you suddenIy
become my conscience?

1173
01:51:42,367 --> 01:51:45,302
I've aIready seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

1174
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:50,069
I don't see why I shouId watch it
happen again with your daughter.

1175
01:51:51,977 --> 01:51:54,309
How very caring of you.

1176
01:51:55,614 --> 01:51:57,639
You forget, I was there.

1177
01:51:58,717 --> 01:52:01,880
I watched that woman crucify my son,

1178
01:52:02,287 --> 01:52:05,745
IittIe by IittIe, and I was siIent.

1179
01:52:07,826 --> 01:52:10,317
What does that say about me?

1180
01:52:10,395 --> 01:52:12,727
You're not responsibIe
for what she did.

1181
01:52:12,798 --> 01:52:16,564
But are we not aIso
our brother's keeper?

1182
01:52:17,903 --> 01:52:20,929
You, CharIes, and me?

1183
01:52:24,343 --> 01:52:26,311
I Iet Sebastian down.

1184
01:52:29,248 --> 01:52:31,216
I Iet everyone down.

1185
01:52:35,821 --> 01:52:37,379
WILCO X: This way, sir.

1186
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,191
NURSE: Dear, no, that's too many!

1187
01:52:49,268 --> 01:52:51,361
-Papa...
-Your father needs to rest!

1188
01:52:51,436 --> 01:52:53,631
-Get him away.
-I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

1189
01:52:53,705 --> 01:52:57,732
-Get him away! Get him away!
-Out!

1190
01:52:57,809 --> 01:53:00,334
Everybody out! Out! Out!

1191
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:05,912
-I'm so sorry, Father.
-Not at aII. Give him time.

1192
01:53:05,984 --> 01:53:09,147
I've known worse cases
make beautifuI deaths.

1193
01:53:13,392 --> 01:53:16,156
What were you taIking
to my father about?

1194
01:53:20,265 --> 01:53:22,256
He doesn't want a priest.

1195
01:53:24,469 --> 01:53:26,096
PIease, CharIes.

1196
01:53:26,505 --> 01:53:29,770
PIease don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

1197
01:53:29,841 --> 01:53:31,172
JuIia...

1198
01:53:35,314 --> 01:53:37,248
Let's get out of here.

1199
01:53:37,316 --> 01:53:39,079
We'II go to ItaIy.

1200
01:53:40,385 --> 01:53:43,548
-Capri.
-I can't Ieave now, my father's dying.

1201
01:53:44,956 --> 01:53:48,448
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

1202
01:54:03,475 --> 01:54:07,070
-Why shouId I beIieve you?
-BeIieve me.

1203
01:54:07,646 --> 01:54:09,807
You just bought me from Rex.

1204
01:54:14,219 --> 01:54:16,244
What are you taIking about?

1205
01:54:16,321 --> 01:54:19,051
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

1206
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:24,420
I thought I'd fetch at Ieast three.

1207
01:54:26,598 --> 01:54:28,589
Don't be ridicuIous.

1208
01:54:31,069 --> 01:54:33,970
-That was Rex.
-You agreed to it, CharIes.

1209
01:54:34,673 --> 01:54:36,868
-I had no choice!
-You agreed!

1210
01:54:36,942 --> 01:54:37,966
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1211
01:54:38,043 --> 01:54:39,067
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

1212
01:54:39,144 --> 01:54:42,841
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

1213
01:54:42,914 --> 01:54:46,714
-Is that reaIIy what you think?
-You teII me. PIease, teII me.

1214
01:54:46,785 --> 01:54:49,413
What does CharIes Ryder reaIIy want?

1215
01:55:10,375 --> 01:55:14,744
Can you imagine what it was Iike
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

1216
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:18,480
Me,

1217
01:55:20,252 --> 01:55:22,015
CharIes Ryder,

1218
01:55:23,155 --> 01:55:27,091
''the painter from Paddington,''
as your mother so sweetIy put it.

1219
01:55:28,126 --> 01:55:30,993
There was no humiIiation
