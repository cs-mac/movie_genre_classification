1
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:11,503
In association with

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,885
With the support of

3
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:28,865
Mom!

4
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:55,805
C'mon mom, I've been calling you for
such a long time and you didn't come.

5
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,478
I've been calling you a thousand times.
Why didn't you come?

6
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:02,524
Yes I did. OK, leave me alone!

7
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:05,506
Please, darling, don't be angry.

8
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,705
Yes, I did call you.

9
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,421
She fell asleep.

10
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,627
Did I show you
what he gave me?

11
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,833
What?

12
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,907
I didn't even try it on.

13
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,745
The label's still attached.

14
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:38,125
B plus, 740 Euro.

15
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:42,044
Underneath you can
see the real price.

16
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:44,252
1270.

17
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,958
Silk.

18
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:25,213
When the hunter comes and takes
grannie out of the wolf...

19
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,320
she should be naked. ?

20
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:35,302
Who?

21
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,456
Grannie.

22
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,824
When the hunter comes...

23
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,861
and takes the grandmother out of
the wolf, she should be naked.

24
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,178
I don't understand.

25
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,433
The wolf eats granny.

26
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:57,284
After that, he puts
her clothes on.

27
00:06:57,404 --> 00:07:00,131
When the hunter comes and
takes her out of the wolf...

28
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,731
she should be naked.

29
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,311
That's what they told
them in school?

30
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,716
No, darling, Olguta noticed this.

31
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:18,013
She went to the
teacher and told her.

32
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,810
And what did the teacher say?

33
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,225
That she isn't right.

34
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,202
That she's dressed, because the wolf
took some clothes out of the closet.

35
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,925
She's right.

36
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,869
I have such a bad feeling
about this trip to Budapest.

37
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,224
I don't know what to say.

38
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,525
What's the teacher like?

39
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:17,402
About my age.

40
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:21,906
She has an older sister, she's
a secretary for government.

41
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,159
But she is not so nice.
She's an... ordinary woman.

42
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,654
Popa Claudia.

43
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:45,820
- Is the registration in the car?
- Yes, in the glove compartment.

44
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:55,188
I should give you
an apple, too.

45
00:09:06,243 --> 00:09:08,289
Let me give you those...

46
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:28,440
Here are the paint rollers and
there's also some paint left over.

47
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,610
Put them into a wash-bowl and
leave them there for an hour or two.

48
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,044
- Where to?
- The bathroom.

49
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:42,454
The key...

50
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,295
Here it is.

51
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,730
Where did you leave it? ?

52
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,514
It's on the right side.

53
00:10:01,873 --> 00:10:05,499
It's not on my parking place,
some guy parked his car there.

54
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:08,823
Where on the right side?

55
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,810
When you exit the building,
there's the 24/7 shop.

56
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,444
It's actually the other way,
about the same distance...

57
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,906
It's better if I come with you.
Wait...

58
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:34,759
Wait a moment...

59
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:39,496
You'll get into your bed, right?
I'll be back in a couple of minutes.

60
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:44,481
And why do you go barefoot?
Don't you have shoes?

61
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:49,427
Do you want your bum to look like
a warzone after so many flu shots?

62
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,304
You'll get into bed, right?!

63
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,665
Stay! Stay there!

64
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:17,733
I've told you to
leave it alone.

65
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:26,214
How many times did I tell you?!
Do you really want to see me upset?

66
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:28,792
You really like animals...

67
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,076
At least we understand
each other...

68
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,914
Did you bring
me that money?

69
00:21:06,218 --> 00:21:10,231
Of course I brought it.
I told you I'll give it today.

70
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,024
So give it to me.

71
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:34,925
Believe me, I couldn't
get it any sooner.

72
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,029
I borrowed it from my sister.

73
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,148
If you don't believe me, I'll
give you her number to check.

74
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,689
I'll give you her
number to check.

75
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,596
If you don't believe me...

76
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,352
- Call Nusa, my sister...
- Hold on a second.

77
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,579
Why do you talk
to me like this?

78
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,923
- Why are you talking like this to me?
- Like this how?

79
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:59,174
Like this. You needed
money, I gave it to you.

80
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:03,343
You told me you'd give it back
on the 9th... today is the 2nd.

81
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:05,626
Right? That's three weeks later.

82
00:22:09,398 --> 00:22:11,584
Why do you put
me in this spot?

83
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:18,408
Why do I have to ask
for something of mine?

84
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:21,877
- OK, you're right. - Do you think it's
easy for me to ask for this money?

85
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,346
You're right, OK.
Thank you again.

86
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:26,154
Of course I'm right.

87
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,341
Look what he's doing to me...

88
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:33,243
- What is he doing ?
- Look what you're doing to me!

89
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,748
This one's broken.

90
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:48,287
So what? Put some sticky
tape on, and you can use it.

91
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,486
They'll accept it.

92
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,214
Can I have another?

93
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,423
But what's wrong
with this one?

94
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:09,317
I don't have another
50 note. Take These.

95
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:14,952
Believe me, it's good for...

96
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:21,186
...and lowers the
risk of a stroke.

97
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:06,742
Wait, wait...

98
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,652
- Do they fit the dimensions?
- They fit exactly.

99
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,187
Are you sure?

100
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,163
Positive.

101
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:41,230
How much?

102
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,664
- What do I owe you?
- Nothing.

103
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,950
Look at me, I'm at least
15 years your senior.

104
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:54,705
You asked me to help you
and so I did. That's all.

105
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,830
So, I owe you?

106
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,296
That's better.

107
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,631
Where's the one I gave you?

108
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,184
It's here.

109
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:22,194
Here it is.

110
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:24,959
No, it's not.

111
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:29,869
Here it is.

112
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,790
- Do you mind if I check it?
- Please do.

113
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:43,042
A caliper?

114
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,804
Over there.

115
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,371
Next to the lathe.

116
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,803
They cooked up quite
something about you.

117
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:07,615
The scheme was
designed on top level.

118
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,193
Toma, Carjan, these folks.

119
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:13,993
Not Madescu, he's
too much of a sucker.

120
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,607
Just so you know...

121
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:24,819
I used two old firing pins
from a Browning...

122
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,447
which I adapted for yours...

123
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:30,822
What if it blows in my face?

124
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,855
No way, it's a perfect job.

125
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,846
By the exact specifications.

126
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:39,338
The Browning and Beretta firing pins
are made from the same alloy.

127
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:46,598
I'll reward somehow the guy
I took the firing pins from.

128
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:51,415
Labor if free of charge.

129
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,373
I got it.

130
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:07,081
Is 200 OK?

131
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,733
100 is enough.

132
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:13,662
Normally it costs 15, but
I'm satisfied with this much.

133
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,883
Careful how you place them.

134
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:50,824
Did I tell you you're not allowed
in the bathroom?

135
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,145
Did I tell you you're not allowed
with your toys in the bathroom?

136
00:40:57,439 --> 00:41:00,932
You'll get a good thrashing from
your father when he gets home.

137
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,188
- Don't tell him.
- No?!

138
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:06,074
Don't tell him?!
Look at this mess!

139
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,668
Leave it, leave it...
I have to mop up first.

140
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,522
It'll drain here, near
the threshold.

141
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:15,898
Just take a look, you beast,
what you've done here!

142
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,505
Take the toys to your room!

143
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:24,943
Did you hear what I said?

144
00:41:25,063 --> 00:41:27,442
Take your toys and
off to your room!

145
00:41:28,283 --> 00:41:29,502
Now!

146
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,847
What are you doing? Paddle in the water?
Go away, your socks will get wet.

147
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:42,008
I'm sorry, it's just
now I noticed it.

148
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:44,598
A broken pipe would've
been worse.

149
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,541
Broken pipe? And is this
not serious?

150
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,273
Isn't it serious if a child
destroys all our work?!

151
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:56,686
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say,
I'll talk to my husband and...

152
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:59,076
Is your place this wet also?

153
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,973
So so.

154
00:42:01,533 --> 00:42:04,134
Anyway, I'm painting the rooms...

155
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,481
I'm sorry, I'll talk
and we'll settle it.

156
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:12,250
Sorry, I have to clean up.

157
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,196
Good day.

158
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:18,215
I'll cut off your hands!

159
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:19,704
You hear me?

160
00:42:20,513 --> 00:42:22,551
One day I'll cut off
your hands.

161
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:26,973
Like your father weren't enough.

162
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:36,761
He comes home, wants to eat...
set the table, clear the table.

163
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:40,541
Look what you've done!
I just cleaned this morning.

164
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:49,157
Go and change your socks...

165
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:26,674
- Didn't you say you're coming late?
- Yes I did.

166
00:44:27,796 --> 00:44:29,407
Come on in, Doru.

167
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:35,543
How are you?

168
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:38,665
How's the pumping going?

169
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:42,274
Oh, you didn't even start...

170
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,014
Pusa...

171
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:48,656
Painting is long off... he's
only now cleaning the walls.

172
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,825
We went to the cemetery.

173
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:58,293
- And you didn't take the nails out...
- Oh, what a mess.

174
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:02,476
If I knew you were off, I would've
asked you to come.

175
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,724
From times of yore...

176
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:16,795
Where are you? You'll have to go to
the home improvement store

177
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,755
and buy a good spatula.
This one's useless.

178
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:23,659
There are these ones called
Viking, with an elastic blade.

179
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:26,811
If you want a good finish...

180
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:29,135
Come here for a moment.

181
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,004
Come here.

182
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:36,640
Beautiful.

183
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,137
This color really suits you.

184
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:43,440
And it matches your jeans.

185
00:45:45,295 --> 00:45:46,582
Come on.

186
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:57,099
- Say 'May his soul rest in heaven'.
- May his soul rest in heaven.

187
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:03,006
I say you buy everything you need
from the home improvement store...

188
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,305
If you want a good finish.

189
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:13,360
Oh, you didn't even
take the furniture out.

190
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,911
Or the books.

191
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:24,888
And I thought you'd already
painted at least a room.

192
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,504
When you take out the furniture
and start working...

193
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,777
you have to strip the whole
wall and start over.

194
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:39,236
It's really badly done...

195
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:42,530
Let's go.

196
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:48,400
The plate and cup are
Chinese porcelain.

197
00:46:49,018 --> 00:46:50,731
Be careful with them.

198
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:54,950
You could've washed these dishes...

199
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,942
Look for a bag. If he has one...

200
00:47:14,843 --> 00:47:16,536
Help me, please.

201
00:47:19,285 --> 00:47:21,484
Put these inside here.

202
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:29,748
Anything else?

203
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,069
Yes. This too.

204
00:47:34,784 --> 00:47:36,609
Turn off the light.

205
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:38,960
We're leaving. Bye!

206
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:47,067
We actually came by thinking you're
not here and wanted to fool around.

207
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,890
Good bye.

208
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:55,206
- What's wrong? Do you have a fever?
- No, I don't.

209
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:57,385
Please, just leave me.

210
00:47:57,505 --> 00:48:00,122
Check your temperature
and take a Paracetamol.

211
00:48:00,242 --> 00:48:01,409
OK, good bye.

212
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,646
Good bye.

213
00:49:22,613 --> 00:49:24,759
No, the other way round.

214
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:26,654
Like this.

215
00:50:45,863 --> 00:50:49,624
Would you like to see the catalogue,
maybe you like something else.

216
00:50:49,744 --> 00:50:54,540
We can order something for you,
you'd have it in 30 days tops.

217
00:50:54,743 --> 00:50:55,757
No.

218
00:51:05,635 --> 00:51:06,973
Excuse me.

219
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,431
Yes...

220
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:24,462
Have you decided?

221
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:26,152
No.

222
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:30,025
- Do you have covers?
- I'll be with you in a moment.

223
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:36,320
We also have second-hand weapons.

224
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:39,825
Like what?

225
00:51:40,362 --> 00:51:41,842
Russian, Czech.

226
00:51:42,942 --> 00:51:44,487
You mean the price?

227
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:46,550
2100, 2300...

228
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:47,989
2200.

229
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,791
CZ, the Czech one, is 1700.

230
00:51:51,911 --> 00:51:54,730
And it's a good weapon,
nobody complained.

231
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,050
Fuck you, cocksucker...

232
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:00,258
Mircea!

233
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,072
Are you stupid, cocksucker?

234
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:04,728
We can hear your nice
language from here.

235
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:09,902
Should I show you a CZ?

236
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:16,603
Just tell me what you'd like.

237
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:18,285
I need a 12mm.

238
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:19,917
They're both 12.

239
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:33,368
- Could you please pack this up?
- Go to my colleague.

240
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:40,067
- Could you please pack this up for me?
- One moment.

241
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:42,786
Um, yes, potatoes...

242
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:47,478
Give me a piece
of chicken, too.

243
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,440
And some mushrooms.

244
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:58,724
One moment.

245
00:53:05,281 --> 00:53:08,717
And, please, a green salad, too.

246
00:54:43,685 --> 00:54:44,719
Good evening.

247
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:46,442
Hi.

248
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:51,961
Weren't you supposed
to call first?

249
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,033
Why won't it come out?

250
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:24,181
Take it easy, OK?

251
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,350
You might break the edges.

252
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:29,583
Hey, are you stupid?

253
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,247
Look what you've done!

254
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:34,866
- You can fix them.
- My ass! You can't mount them like this.

255
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:38,322
- They got stuck.
- OK, but you broke the tap, can't you see?!

256
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,420
There's one more screw.

257
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,872
- Take it easy!
- Excuse me...

258
00:55:42,992 --> 00:55:45,518
- Are you taking the books now?
- No.

259
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,904
I'll come back next
week for the books.

260
00:55:48,024 --> 00:55:49,890
Where am I gonna put them?

261
00:55:51,157 --> 00:55:52,515
Take those too.

262
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,744
Easy, easy, easy!

263
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:57,035
Put that away, bend down...

264
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,603
Slowly... not by yourself,
wait for him!

265
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,113
OK, ready.

266
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:04,600
We'll take that one last.

267
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,570
Take it last... Grab it now,
it won't kill you!

268
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,083
- You take this one and...
- Come on!

269
00:56:12,728 --> 00:56:15,394
Don't take anything
from this room. OK?

270
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,302
- Nothing goes from this room.
- OK.

271
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:20,948
Nothing goes from this room.

272
00:56:21,068 --> 00:56:23,725
Well, there are those
books over there...

273
00:56:24,201 --> 00:56:25,448
- OK?
- OK.

274
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:29,502
And, from this room...
again, nothing.

275
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:31,955
Those boxes are mine.

276
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:33,222
OK.

277
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:35,583
What are you doing with those?

278
00:56:35,999 --> 00:56:37,519
Taking them to the car.

279
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:40,894
No, you're taking them back to
where you got them. Come on.

280
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,965
No, you're not taking these.

281
00:56:43,085 --> 00:56:45,040
So you got to keep those?

282
00:56:46,434 --> 00:56:48,238
Yes, I got to keep those.

283
00:56:48,755 --> 00:56:52,018
I thought thinks weren't settled,
that's why I asked.

284
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,993
- Come here a bit.
- OK.

285
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,699
Here, in the living room...

286
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:03,074
from the middle to the window,
everything stays.

287
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:04,669
- OK?
- OK.

288
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:14,034
So, from the middle
to the window...

289
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:17,202
you're not taking anything:
CD's, DVD's...

290
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:19,904
vinyls, books...

291
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:21,368
I understand.

292
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,407
I heard you we're
wallpapering.

293
00:58:14,705 --> 00:58:16,073
You heard wrong.

294
00:58:29,158 --> 00:58:31,054
I'm putting Raufaser on.

295
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:36,917
That estuco veneciano stuff?

296
00:58:41,293 --> 00:58:42,591
No, it's a...

297
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:46,371
paper wallpaper that
you paint over.

298
00:58:49,412 --> 00:58:51,824
That stuff's bad,
from what I know.

299
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:53,272
But, oh well...

300
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:56,069
What can I say? Good luck
with your work.

301
00:58:57,589 --> 00:59:01,177
If I said something, that would
mean digging my own grave.

302
00:59:03,479 --> 00:59:04,431
Yea?

303
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:09,813
Yea, it'd give you the chance
to say I'm always butting in.

304
00:59:13,473 --> 00:59:14,923
Is that what I said?

305
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,186
No, you said worse.

306
00:59:19,382 --> 00:59:21,338
You talked about manipulation.

307
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:23,558
- Yea?
- Yes.

308
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:50,828
Come on, faster, boys!

309
00:59:50,948 --> 00:59:53,301
Take them before
we lose all night.

310
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:20,603
Take these, too.

311
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,471
Yea...

312
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,144
Be careful going
down the stairs.

313
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:43,589
Good evening.

314
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,721
Good evening. Excuse me,
is the owner home?

315
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:48,596
Someone's looking for you.

316
01:00:49,498 --> 01:00:51,707
- Good evening.
- Good evening, neighbour.

317
01:00:51,827 --> 01:00:53,916
- What do you say?
- Good evening.

318
01:00:54,036 --> 01:00:58,303
Sir, we apologize. I know that doesn't
mean much in cases like these...

319
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:01,552
and that's why we'd like to
see the exact damages.

320
01:01:01,765 --> 01:01:06,062
So there aren't any misunderstandings.
Especially for my son, the one at fault.

321
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:07,937
May I please inspect
the bathroom?

322
01:01:08,057 --> 01:01:09,877
- OK.
- Can I take this?

323
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:12,177
Yes.

324
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:14,911
Yea...

325
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,800
You can see the spot clearly.

326
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,128
Come here!

327
01:01:22,624 --> 01:01:24,205
You see what you did?

328
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:25,806
You like it?

329
01:01:27,165 --> 01:01:28,259
You see?

330
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:31,056
You see, son, what
hassle you give me?!

331
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,337
My wife told me you thought
there was a busted pipe.

332
01:01:36,457 --> 01:01:38,871
I don't think that's the case.

333
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:42,985
Move over so these
people can pass.

334
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:47,647
Do you think there's a busted pipe?
I dunno... you're looking at me like...

335
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:51,164
That's what I thought at first,
but now it's all clear.

336
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,323
So it's clearly not
a busted pipe.

337
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,346
Right.

338
01:01:54,466 --> 01:01:57,356
Anyway, we're still
at fault. It's not like...

339
01:01:57,678 --> 01:01:59,208
Say you're sorry.

340
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,124
Please excuse me.

341
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:04,853
- Because...
- Because I'll never do it again.

342
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:06,890
OK.

343
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:11,524
You know how much this is
gonna cost us? Do you?!

344
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,882
5 million.

345
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:17,099
Am I right neighbour?

346
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:18,989
- About 5 mil.
- Good evening.

347
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:21,756
- Hello. - What are you
doing here? Go upstairs.

348
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:24,837
- I told you to leave me alone.
- Don't yell at me!

349
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:26,540
Please excuse me.

350
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:29,276
- How is it?
- Go and see for yourself.

351
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,551
There's a stain, no doubt.

352
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:33,722
- The damage is done.
- It's not that bad.

353
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:35,636
You know what this means?

354
01:02:35,879 --> 01:02:38,585
5 million means no
money for camp...

355
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:41,307
and no toys from
Santa this year.

356
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,337
- Of course so...
- Shut your mouth already!

357
01:02:44,457 --> 01:02:45,766
Take it easy!

358
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,040
- Say good evening.
- Good evening.

359
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:49,971
Come.

360
01:02:49,991 --> 01:02:53,012
And go do your homework.
We've got school tomorrow.

361
01:02:53,305 --> 01:02:54,937
- Go!
- Good evening.

362
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:57,704
Sorry, that's how it is.

363
01:02:57,824 --> 01:03:01,722
Now, between the two of us,
I hope this 5 mil thing is a joke.

364
01:03:02,062 --> 01:03:04,666
It can't be that much.
Can I look in the kitchen?

365
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:06,967
Yea. It didn't reach
the kitchen.

366
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,116
So there's no spot
up here, right?

367
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:13,413
There's clearly no spot.
It's just the bathroom.

368
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:17,147
Clearly. Just the bathroom.

369
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:19,995
In my view, it can't be
more than 500 thousand.

370
01:03:21,045 --> 01:03:23,792
- Are you thinking about damages?
- Obviously.

371
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:27,592
I don't think it's necessary.
I'm painting...

372
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:29,021
Yes, I see.

373
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:32,309
That's that. Anyway, I...

374
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:35,299
Go upstairs, woman!
I'll be there in a minute.

375
01:03:35,836 --> 01:03:37,194
I'll be there shortly.

376
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,289
Come on!

377
01:03:38,409 --> 01:03:39,860
Please believe me...

378
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:42,789
Look at me: I work
12 hours a day...

379
01:03:43,017 --> 01:03:44,385
Look at my hands.

380
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:47,380
Do I like coming home, hearing
the kid's been up to no good?

381
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,701
What can I do, kill him?
He's my son...

382
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:50,806
Once again, sorry.

383
01:03:50,926 --> 01:03:54,475
Anyway, think about it, keep us
posted, and we'll pay for it.

384
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:55,894
What can you do?

385
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:57,271
Good evening.

386
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:59,562
Actually, good luck
with your work.

387
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:01,795
Good evening.

388
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:12,224
Excuse me.

389
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:14,545
Last one, right?

390
01:04:14,665 --> 01:04:15,883
Last one.

391
01:04:17,494 --> 01:04:18,497
Come.

392
01:04:33,182 --> 01:04:34,160
Hey...

393
01:04:34,778 --> 01:04:35,964
We're leaving.

394
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:38,680
We took those books, too.

395
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:43,625
Would've asked the boys to sweep up,
but we'd only be raising dust.

396
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:46,503
Cheers! Good evening.

397
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,400
"Mitica Dragomir
angered football fans."

398

"restrictive measures,

The Constitutional Court"

"But even the demonstration
held today"

413
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:32,755
"brought arguments for
the disputed items."

414

Who gives you the
right to question

415
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:11,324
my rights regarding
my own home?

416
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:15,925
They're impertinent.
No matter.

417
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:18,611
We're all more or
less impertinent.

418
01:19:19,016 --> 01:19:21,084
Of course I'm right, only...

419
01:24:57,623 --> 01:24:58,982
- Hello.
- Hello.

420
01:25:00,034 --> 01:25:01,372
Is Gina in?

421
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:03,196
Gina!

422
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:07,149
I'll wait here.

423
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,237
What do you mean?
Come inside.

424
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:11,319
Come on.

425
01:25:13,295 --> 01:25:14,582
From the start.

426
01:25:16,356 --> 01:25:18,028
Second part then. Gina!

427
01:25:18,148 --> 01:25:19,224
Hey, Olga!

428
01:25:20,836 --> 01:25:23,025
Why are all your clothes there?
Can you tell me that?

429
01:25:23,145 --> 01:25:25,357
- I'm choosing them.
- So do it.

430
01:25:26,593 --> 01:25:28,529
This is not the piano hour.

431
01:25:31,607 --> 01:25:33,471
Please come here afterwards.

432
01:25:36,603 --> 01:25:37,748
Here you go.

433
01:25:37,868 --> 01:25:40,627
Take these. And don't
pack too many again.

434
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:44,623
You're not gonna wear them, and
daddy will buy you some more there.

435
01:25:44,835 --> 01:25:46,092
How many days?

436
01:25:46,212 --> 01:25:48,525
3. How many times a
day do you change?

437
01:25:49,325 --> 01:25:50,693
- 2 times.
- 2 times.

438
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:52,508
- 3 times 2 is...
- 6.

439
01:25:53,049 --> 01:25:56,028
- So you need 6...
- 6 blouses and 3 pants.

440
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,940
6 t-shirts, 6 long-sleeved
blouses, 3 pants, right?

441
01:26:00,153 --> 01:26:02,595
And underwear and
socks. Let's go.

442
01:26:04,112 --> 01:26:05,622
Let's go out a bit.

443
01:26:12,696 --> 01:26:14,217
Gina, hold on a bit.

444
01:26:14,664 --> 01:26:16,833
Tell me something.
Just a second.

445
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:18,120
Yes.

446
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:20,340
What?

447
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:21,637
That money...

448
01:26:22,012 --> 01:26:23,380
- 200 Euros.
- Right.

449
01:26:25,934 --> 01:26:27,475
You owe me 100 more.

450
01:26:28,093 --> 01:26:29,340
When, now?

451
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,939
I don't have any money,
didn't I tell you?

452
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:33,855
Can I wear these
on the train?

453
01:26:33,975 --> 01:26:36,534
Don't you know how
dirty it is on the train?!

454
01:26:36,654 --> 01:26:39,716
Wear this gray training suit.
Go and pack it now.

455
01:26:40,415 --> 01:26:41,642
Well, then?

456
01:26:41,762 --> 01:26:43,811
We'll see. Give me a minute.

457
01:26:47,321 --> 01:26:50,534
I saw that you were calling,
but I couldn't answer.

458
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:52,156
I couldn't.

459
01:27:02,198 --> 01:27:03,637
What did she say?

460
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,644
- Who? Lulu?
- Yea.

461
01:27:06,708 --> 01:27:08,482
She didn't say anything.

462
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:11,673
We did have a more detailed
conversation, but...

463
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:13,912
I'll tell you after...

464
01:27:19,266 --> 01:27:23,077
Anyway, they're leaving in half an hour.
The train is at quarter past 11.

465
01:27:24,182 --> 01:27:26,462
I thought we'd see
each other after.

466
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:31,408
You could come at about 12,
give me time to return.

467
01:27:32,928 --> 01:27:33,860
OK?

468
01:27:38,889 --> 01:27:39,974
I don't know.

469
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:42,832
Don't get upset.

470
01:27:45,062 --> 01:27:46,420
Come on, fatty.

471
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:52,047
Let me get you those.

472
01:27:52,574 --> 01:27:53,689
Hold on.

473
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,359
This for now. Tomorrow
I'll get you a box.

474
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:15,326
Someone's taking care of it.

475
01:28:16,522 --> 01:28:18,772
- What?
- How long are you gonna be?

476
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,681
- Excuse me?
- How long are you going to...

477
01:28:22,157 --> 01:28:23,971
They're pink, not red.

478
01:28:24,392 --> 01:28:27,513
- What's this about pink boots now?
- I wanna know where they are.

479
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:30,624
How should I know?
Go back in and look.

480
01:28:30,744 --> 01:28:33,334
You really need me for
every little thing?

481
01:28:33,454 --> 01:28:35,473
You're getting so worked up...

482
01:28:35,593 --> 01:28:36,831
Please excuse me.

483
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:38,422
Is that the way we talk?

484
01:28:45,197 --> 01:28:46,869
Can I have 2 minutes?!

485
01:28:47,204 --> 01:28:50,224
Look in the bathroom. Don't you
remember you came back all muddy?

486
01:28:50,344 --> 01:28:52,960
I should remember
everything for you.

487
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:54,146
Yea...

488
01:28:54,575 --> 01:28:57,281
I can't stay. I'll call when
I'm back from the station.

489
01:28:58,477 --> 01:28:59,794
I'll call you, OK?

490
01:31:20,081 --> 01:31:22,432
I was just telling Stoian
it must be you.

491
01:31:23,172 --> 01:31:24,135
Yea?

492
01:31:26,223 --> 01:31:28,696
He got a scare when
the doorbell rang.

493
01:31:29,537 --> 01:31:31,220
I'm with Madam Truica.

494
01:31:33,672 --> 01:31:34,899
You see them?

495
01:31:35,019 --> 01:31:36,105
The shirts...

496
01:31:36,225 --> 01:31:38,851
Washed, pressed. Don't
leave without them.

497
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:44,239
I made some mashed beans.

498
01:31:59,652 --> 01:32:01,547
You catch that? The smell...

499
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,432
You'd say it was
New Year's Eve.

500
01:32:09,139 --> 01:32:11,926
I went to The Financial Precint
this morning.

501
01:32:12,564 --> 01:32:14,723
My God, what a crowd...

502
01:32:17,186 --> 01:32:19,618
Only about 200 people.
All pensioners.

503
01:32:20,986 --> 01:32:23,449
Everybody piling up...

504
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,973
Right now, it's good. Submit it before
the 15th, get a 5% discount.

505
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:31,031
That's why they're piling up.

506
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:34,284
But it doesn't add up
for small figures.

507
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:44,145
They're piling up for 5%.

508
01:32:47,587 --> 01:32:49,503
What money turns you into...

509
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:52,989
I didn't submit it.

510
01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:54,651
Only took the forms.

511
01:32:54,966 --> 01:32:57,449
I have to go there again
in order to submit them.

512
01:32:58,128 --> 01:33:00,246
If the crowd's the same...

513
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:11,155
Pusa.

514
01:33:53,464 --> 01:33:54,386
Yes.

515
01:33:58,092 --> 01:34:00,555
I'm sorry, do you have
something against me?

516
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:09,636
Listen, Viorel, even though
I never knew your father...

517
01:34:09,756 --> 01:34:12,108
I hold a special
admiration for him.

518
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:16,385
What did I do? Was I wrong for
helping you out with the bags?

519
01:34:17,683 --> 01:34:20,865
I never touched something
that didn't belong to me.

520
01:34:21,291 --> 01:34:24,940
I borrowed, bought or received
presents, but never appropriated

521
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:27,433
things that weren't mine,
like you say.

522
01:34:27,553 --> 01:34:29,337
- Mr. Stoian.
- Never...

523
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:31,101
Look at this house...

524
01:34:32,052 --> 01:34:35,589
and all the things in it, and please
try to remember the following:

525
01:34:36,309 --> 01:34:39,826
If there's any other owner
for these belongings...

526
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:41,589
that owner is me.

527
01:34:42,526 --> 01:34:46,449
And don't think that Pusa can't see
you trying to emulate other people.

528
01:34:46,569 --> 01:34:48,678
You'd better review
your plans.

529
01:34:49,205 --> 01:34:50,594
What do you mean?

530
01:34:51,334 --> 01:34:52,732
What do I mean?

531
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,529
For starters, stop wearing
dad's raincoat.

532
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,202
Pusa gave it to me.

533
01:35:00,067 --> 01:35:01,121
Mr. Stoian...

534
01:35:02,225 --> 01:35:04,870
Maybe you really don't touch
other people's things...

535
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:08,164
and maybe you're courting
Pusa because you like her...

536
01:35:09,269 --> 01:35:11,164
but please leave me alone.

537
01:35:13,075 --> 01:35:16,380
I don't like you, and you
should've gotten that already.

538
01:35:17,494 --> 01:35:19,207
It's chemical and epidermal.

539
01:35:19,327 --> 01:35:22,471
And, frankly, I'm bothered
by your sense of humor.

540
01:35:23,565 --> 01:35:25,602
So, please, stay
away from me.

541
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:30,173
Don't let me catch you in my
room when I'm not home.

542
01:35:31,704 --> 01:35:32,768
Understood?

543
01:36:13,637 --> 01:36:14,518
Pusa.

544
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,264
- Yes.
- I'm leaving.

545
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:22,581
Wait, wait!

546
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:31,226
I left my suitcases
in the room.

547
01:36:31,346 --> 01:36:34,261
- What suitcases?
- What suitcases... Suitcases.

548
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:37,983
- What am I gonna do with them?
- Dunno, take 'em to storage.

549
01:36:40,824 --> 01:36:43,176
Right, the big one and
the plastic one.

550
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:44,970
Let me show you
something.

551
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:46,530
Something I made.

552
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:49,307
Listen, I want this door
to remain closed.

553
01:36:49,672 --> 01:36:51,000
Closed, yes.

554
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,912
This one's violet.

555
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:57,040
This one's orange.

556
01:36:58,074 --> 01:36:59,716
They're complementary.

557
01:36:59,836 --> 01:37:01,242
What do you think?

558
01:37:01,657 --> 01:37:03,613
They're woolen.
Feel them.

559
01:37:04,353 --> 01:37:05,235
Here.

560
01:37:05,752 --> 01:37:06,948
What are they?

561
01:37:07,282 --> 01:37:08,519
Little hats.

562
01:37:10,309 --> 01:37:12,569
Let me get you a bag
or something.

563
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:19,157
What's with you?

564
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:22,373
What happened?

565
01:37:25,008 --> 01:37:26,296
What's with you?

566
01:37:27,421 --> 01:37:28,454
Hello?!

567
01:37:33,902 --> 01:37:36,416
I don't know what to think
of this man anymore.

568
01:37:36,689 --> 01:37:38,220
He's like a girl.

569
01:37:39,963 --> 01:37:41,645
Come on,
put them in.

570
01:37:43,378 --> 01:37:45,010
You should've brought
a smaller one.

571
01:37:45,233 --> 01:37:47,402
- That's what I have.
- They'll wrinkle.

572
01:37:47,522 --> 01:37:49,024
They won't wrinkle.

573
01:37:55,697 --> 01:37:57,917
You should've
turned them over.

574
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:01,607
- Here.
- Hold on.

575
01:38:02,346 --> 01:38:03,654
Let me hold it.

576
01:38:11,046 --> 01:38:14,046
- Take them out when you get home.
- Don't you have a smaller one?

577
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:15,090
No.

578
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:18,222
It's perfectly fine.

579
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:25,764
Kisses.

580
01:38:26,392 --> 01:38:27,467
Good night.

581
01:38:28,794 --> 01:38:29,838
Kiss you.

582
01:38:53,722 --> 01:38:58,364
Train 1798 from Piatra Olt
is arriving at Terminal 3.

583
01:39:05,224 --> 01:39:13,332
Train 663 for Iasi, with stops in Ploiesti
and Buzau is leaving from Terminal 5.

584
01:51:11,777 --> 01:51:13,906
Brasov, minus 2 degrees.

585
01:51:16,834 --> 01:51:18,790
Minus 11 in The Capital.

586
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:21,445
Stay tuned to
Radio Info Pro...

587
01:51:47,724 --> 01:51:48,737
Shut up!

588
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:32,445
- Well, well.
- Hello.

589
01:52:32,565 --> 01:52:33,560
Mornin'.

590
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:37,036
What a surprise! So that's
why this mutt was barking.

591
01:52:37,391 --> 01:52:40,665
Bitch, if you don't quit
yelling, I'll eat you alive!

592
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,388
I'll show you!

593
01:52:46,334 --> 01:52:48,807
So what's with you
at this early hour?

594
01:52:50,216 --> 01:52:51,543
Can't you sleep?

595
01:52:51,663 --> 01:52:52,871
Yes, I can.

596
01:52:55,565 --> 01:52:57,024
The girls have gone.

597
01:53:00,176 --> 01:53:02,335
Don't say you're
looking for me.

598
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,043
I am.

599
01:53:10,465 --> 01:53:11,580
Come inside.

600
01:53:12,269 --> 01:53:13,232
But...

601
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:15,284
You're tired.

602
01:53:16,439 --> 01:53:17,939
Why won't you sleep?

603
01:53:18,345 --> 01:53:19,642
Wipe your feet.

604
01:53:26,914 --> 01:53:29,468
Can you tell me what
use I have for...

605
01:53:29,588 --> 01:53:30,908
that cupboard?

606
01:53:31,465 --> 01:53:32,631
Or this one?

607
01:53:34,778 --> 01:53:37,757
Wait till you see the garage:
a regular flea market.

608
01:53:39,551 --> 01:53:42,034
This is what happens
when things go bad.

609
01:53:45,186 --> 01:53:46,889
Let me get you a coffee.

610
01:54:00,685 --> 01:54:02,013
Some time today?

611
01:54:11,231 --> 01:54:13,279
Sugar, one teaspoon or two?

612
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:19,066
Two.

613
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:39,895
Besides the fact that you
need sleep, you look good.

614
01:54:56,565 --> 01:54:58,400
Yes, here they are.

615
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:01,673
3350.

616
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,521
OK? For 3 months...

617
01:55:05,241 --> 01:55:06,761
March, April, May.

618
01:55:14,352 --> 01:55:15,791
Won't you count them?

619
01:55:15,911 --> 01:55:18,650
I will. Now sit down
and drink your coffee.

620
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:22,044
And, come on, man,
take your coat off!

621
01:55:23,109 --> 01:55:24,295
For God's sake!

622
01:55:25,409 --> 01:55:27,588
You'll be cold
when you go out.

623
01:55:34,115 --> 01:55:35,828
What? Go and sit down.

624
01:55:37,085 --> 01:55:38,139
That's it.

625
01:55:54,896 --> 01:55:55,970
It's cold.

626
01:55:56,943 --> 01:55:58,656
You want me to
heat it up?

627
01:56:02,173 --> 01:56:03,075
No.

628
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,723
Thank God, the
girls are alright.

629
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:32,784
And they're not
missing you.

630
01:56:52,911 --> 01:56:54,158
How is Pusa?

631
01:57:00,246 --> 01:57:01,594
How is Pusa?!

632
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,915
Pusa is fine. Why don't
you give her a call?

633
01:57:10,145 --> 01:57:11,341
Why would I?

634
01:57:19,792 --> 01:57:22,022
To ask how she's
doing, for example.

635
01:57:27,413 --> 01:57:28,589
I'll call her.

636
01:57:46,249 --> 01:57:47,567
I'm making moussaka.

637
01:57:58,267 --> 01:58:00,426
Dan went to
drive the girls.

638
01:58:22,073 --> 01:58:25,175
You know what I feel most
sorry for in all of this?

639
01:58:27,191 --> 01:58:29,685
You, dividing up
every last inch...

640
01:58:30,293 --> 01:58:34,823
what I did for you, and what you
did years ago, in kindergarten.

641
01:58:37,772 --> 01:58:39,141
This isn't right.

642
01:58:41,047 --> 01:58:45,243
This is how you get to crossing
the street when seeing someone.

643
01:58:47,969 --> 01:58:48,871
Right?

644
01:58:52,016 --> 01:58:53,293
I don't know.

645
01:58:53,972 --> 01:58:55,087
You tell me.

646
01:59:00,908 --> 01:59:02,834
And who is the person?

647
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:04,942
Guess.

648
01:59:15,922 --> 01:59:17,422
What's that on your lip?

649
01:59:19,135 --> 01:59:20,179
Herpes.

650
01:59:21,575 --> 01:59:23,288
Put some toothpaste on.

651
01:59:27,078 --> 01:59:28,639
You caught me busy.

652
02:05:47,977 --> 02:05:51,866
"And the birdie, in her flight"

653
02:05:52,145 --> 02:05:55,718
"Flew all the way to Bihor"

654
02:06:00,101 --> 02:06:03,965
"And flew all the way to my house"

655
02:06:12,873 --> 02:06:16,458
"And I see my mother and father"

656
02:06:17,142 --> 02:06:19,942
"And I see my brother sometimes"

657
02:06:29,434 --> 02:06:31,790
"And I see my neighbors"

658
02:06:33,779 --> 02:06:36,490
"Because I miss them so much"

659
02:06:55,501 --> 02:06:58,579
"All my life, I liked having
love close by"

660
02:06:58,699 --> 02:07:00,986
"Loneliness is not good"

661
02:07:01,810 --> 02:07:05,041
"Whoever doesn't live life as a couple,
Is always missing out"

662
02:07:05,161 --> 02:07:07,828
"There's no one there for him"

663
02:07:09,614 --> 02:07:11,907
Hey, Lenuta, I see we have guests!

664
02:07:12,186 --> 02:07:13,732
Where are you?

665
02:07:13,852 --> 02:07:16,216
You're starting out a bit early...

666
02:07:58,616 --> 02:08:00,858
"Happiness is like a cure"

667
02:08:02,075 --> 02:08:04,152
"Listen to my words"

668
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,712
"A sad life is never helpful"

669
02:08:08,042 --> 02:08:10,918
"What use is being born
into the world then?!"

670
02:08:11,297 --> 02:08:14,414
"I throw money around
without any care"

671
02:08:14,756 --> 02:08:17,619
"Because I know what I have to lose"

672
02:08:17,936 --> 02:08:20,394
"If I don't live my life now"

673
02:08:20,514 --> 02:08:23,003
"I won't ever live it"

674
02:11:00,188 --> 02:11:01,474
Is Andreea in?

675
02:11:03,725 --> 02:11:06,492
I'm looking for miss
Bratila Andreea. Is she in?

676
02:11:09,887 --> 02:11:12,289
- Who are you looking for?
- Miss Bratila Andreea.

677
02:11:12,409 --> 02:11:14,468
- Is she in?
- Who are you?

678
02:11:15,197 --> 02:11:17,407
- Come again?
- I asked who are you.

679
02:11:18,949 --> 02:11:21,716
- Who are you?, for that matter.
- What do you mean?

680
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,865
What kind of question is that?

681
02:11:24,088 --> 02:11:26,338
Why don't you simply
go and get her?

682
02:11:34,166 --> 02:11:36,771
Come back at 10 o'clock and
speak to our boss then.

683
02:11:36,891 --> 02:11:39,751
Oh, really?! Who are you?
I haven't seen you before.

684
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:44,358
Why are you covering for her?
Can you tell me that? Why?

685
02:11:45,229 --> 02:11:46,775
If you are smart,

686
02:11:46,895 --> 02:11:49,450
smart enough and
have nothing to hide,

687
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:51,224
why won't you let me in?

688
02:11:51,344 --> 02:11:54,183
Come back in half an hour
and talk to our boss.

689
02:11:54,303 --> 02:11:57,791
- Why won't you let me in?
- We have work to do. Please come back later.

690
02:11:57,911 --> 02:12:00,284
- You have something to hide?
- We have a store to fix.

691
02:12:00,771 --> 02:12:02,170
I won't bother you.

692
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:05,343
- Please don't come in!
- I'll just sit here quietly and wait for Andreea.

693
02:12:05,463 --> 02:12:07,126
What are you looking at?

694
02:12:07,988 --> 02:12:09,802
What's wrong with my jeans?

695
02:12:10,248 --> 02:12:11,292
Nothing.

696
02:12:11,941 --> 02:12:13,714
- So, they're fine.
- Yes.

697
02:12:14,181 --> 02:12:15,802
- You like them?
- Yes.

698
02:12:19,608 --> 02:12:21,706
Let's see what you've got here.

699
02:12:21,826 --> 02:12:23,439
Please don't mess it up.

700
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:24,655
I'm not.

701
02:12:26,276 --> 02:12:27,927
Valentino, Valentino...

702
02:12:28,047 --> 02:12:29,823
Go call Emilia.

703
02:12:30,941 --> 02:12:33,201
And, besides Valentino...

704
02:12:38,068 --> 02:12:39,821
Could you come for
a moment, please?

705
02:12:39,941 --> 02:12:42,305
Tell me, have you ever
thought about

706
02:12:42,595 --> 02:12:45,433
why women started
wearing pants?

707
02:12:49,821 --> 02:12:50,825
Have you?

708
02:12:50,945 --> 02:12:52,963
Hello, how have you been?

709
02:12:54,361 --> 02:12:57,356
Hello. Well, I was just walking
down Calea Victoriei,

710
02:12:57,476 --> 02:12:59,127
and I thought I'd stop by

711
02:13:00,394 --> 02:13:03,830
and have a chat with Andreea,
but I'm out of luck.

712
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:05,989
Sorry, Andreea doesn't
work here anymore.

713
02:13:06,283 --> 02:13:08,391
- Since about a month ago.
- How so?

714
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:10,120
Yes. As far as I know

715
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:13,971
she was trying to get an inspector's
job at the Ministry of Finance.

716
02:13:14,539 --> 02:13:16,272
Are you making fun of me?

717
02:13:16,819 --> 02:13:17,782
No.

718
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:22,159
What's this nonsense about
ministries and financial inspectors?

719
02:13:22,279 --> 02:13:23,345
It's true.

720
02:13:23,608 --> 02:13:25,240
What? What's true?

721
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:28,706
It's true: she hasn't worked here
since the end of January.

722
02:13:29,277 --> 02:13:31,425
So I guess you suddenly remembered?

723
02:13:32,814 --> 02:13:34,091
Which January?

724
02:13:37,790 --> 02:13:38,500
Yes.

725
02:13:41,295 --> 02:13:43,048
So, since two months ago?

726
02:13:46,980 --> 02:13:50,801
Can't you see you're trapping
yourselves in your own lies?

727
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:53,994
How can you call me a liar?

728
02:13:54,114 --> 02:13:56,859
How can I?! Allow me...

729
02:13:57,081 --> 02:13:58,328
Please.

730
02:13:59,463 --> 02:14:01,865
Go in and look,
if you don't believe us.

731
02:14:09,823 --> 02:14:11,273
This is too much!

732
02:14:16,267 --> 02:14:18,000
Miss Cati is in there.

733
02:14:20,189 --> 02:14:22,277
Do you need to
use the bathroom?

734
02:14:37,936 --> 02:14:40,084
Does he need to
use the bathroom?

735
02:14:40,204 --> 02:14:42,030
He doesn't need to
use the bathroom.

736
02:14:43,271 --> 02:14:46,879
And, if things are the way
you claim, why did she

737
02:14:47,175 --> 02:14:49,303
say that you won't
be in until 10,

738
02:14:49,689 --> 02:14:51,523
and, if I look at my watch,

739
02:14:51,878 --> 02:14:54,361
and it's quarter to 10
and you're here?

740
02:14:54,481 --> 02:14:58,354
Sir, please, leave us alone!
We have to tidy up until 10 o'clock.

741
02:15:00,929 --> 02:15:02,774
And why do you say, at first,

742
02:15:02,894 --> 02:15:04,973
that she left a month ago,

743
02:15:05,926 --> 02:15:08,997
and then, suddenly, you
change your mind and say that

744
02:15:09,117 --> 02:15:11,192
she left at the end of January?

745
02:15:12,094 --> 02:15:13,087
Why?

746
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:25,716
Leave you?

747
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:28,392
You want me to leave you?

748
02:15:29,898 --> 02:15:31,692
OK, I'll leave you and go.

749
02:15:33,901 --> 02:15:35,391
And you know why?

750
02:15:36,496 --> 02:15:38,077
Have you considered why?

751
02:15:41,344 --> 02:15:42,895
Think about that.

752
02:15:49,868 --> 02:15:51,439
Is there a problem?

753
02:15:59,805 --> 02:16:01,822
- Excuse me, miss Raluca!?
- Yes?

754
02:16:01,942 --> 02:16:04,234
Why don't you sell ladies' lingerie?

755
02:16:10,283 --> 02:16:11,358
How about it?

756
02:16:13,091 --> 02:16:15,655
So you don't have an
answer for everything.

757
02:17:50,881 --> 02:17:53,029
KINDERGARTEN

758
02:17:54,627 --> 02:17:57,728
Turn right and
follow the line.

759
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:21,781
Quiet children, and
eyes on your plates!

760
02:18:24,517 --> 02:18:26,271
Hello, ma'am.
Could you...

761
02:18:26,291 --> 02:18:27,447
One second.

762
02:18:29,535 --> 02:18:31,886
There's no one at Miss Helsighia.

763
02:18:32,006 --> 02:18:35,129
She comes in at 12 o'clock.
She's working noons this week.

764
02:18:35,249 --> 02:18:36,850
I came to get my girl, and...

765
02:18:36,970 --> 02:18:40,904
Everyone's at the Ion Creanga theater,
seeing The Giant Radish.

766
02:19:54,535 --> 02:19:55,670
Come, Lumi.

767
02:19:59,087 --> 02:20:00,415
Come on, dear!

768
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:02,067
Go change.

769
02:20:02,442 --> 02:20:03,415
This way.

770
02:20:07,357 --> 02:20:09,212
We were in mid rehearsal.

771
02:20:11,365 --> 02:20:12,378
Really?

772
02:20:12,652 --> 02:20:14,203
And I'm disturbing you...

773
02:20:27,103 --> 02:20:29,110
What are you doing,
taking her?

774
02:20:30,662 --> 02:20:32,111
I should say so.

775
02:20:32,567 --> 02:20:34,168
What do you think?

776
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:48,382
We were rehearsing for the festivities,
you could let her stay a bit more.

777
02:20:50,237 --> 02:20:51,565
The festivities?

778
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:56,444
Are you preparing for
August 23rd?

779
02:21:12,824 --> 02:21:15,257
Could you let her
stay a bit more?

780
02:21:22,615 --> 02:21:24,277
Mrs. Sofronea...

781
02:21:24,530 --> 02:21:27,216
if I were to tell you that
I'm in in the terminal stage...

782
02:21:27,429 --> 02:21:29,303
would that be enough?

783
02:21:43,333 --> 02:21:44,813
Are you being serious?

784
02:21:46,384 --> 02:21:47,651
Are you?

785
02:21:55,097 --> 02:21:57,732
And you, why don't you
come when I call you?

786
02:21:58,603 --> 02:22:00,438
Come on kids, let's resume.

787
02:22:02,262 --> 02:22:05,161
When I call you,
I want you to come.

788
02:22:05,281 --> 02:22:08,505
And 1, 2, 3, 4...

789
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:17,024
And why are you looking
at me like that?

790
02:22:26,225 --> 02:22:27,918
Put more life into it!

791
02:22:50,304 --> 02:22:51,561
Bye, Nina!

792
02:23:15,103 --> 02:23:18,205
If you don't come at once,
I'm leaving you here.

793
02:23:18,721 --> 02:23:21,589
I'm coming right now.
The water's not running.

794
02:23:21,709 --> 02:23:23,150
Forget about that.

795
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:24,559
OK, right away.

796
02:23:24,679 --> 02:23:25,633
Please.

797
02:23:32,624 --> 02:23:35,107
- Did I tell you we were in a hurry?
- Yes.

798
02:23:42,182 --> 02:23:43,398
Get dressed.

799
02:23:48,101 --> 02:23:50,176
Can you tell me what
took you so long?

800
02:23:50,296 --> 02:23:53,956
I needed to use the bathroom,
and then the toilet wouldn't flush.

801
02:24:34,728 --> 02:24:36,573
The first one was:

802
02:24:36,998 --> 02:24:40,850
"Alexandru has a new key."

803
02:24:42,005 --> 02:24:43,738
The second one was:

804
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:49,414
"Ioana's jacket is new."

805
02:24:50,371 --> 02:24:53,229
Did you know that mauve
is my favorite color?

806
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:55,510
No.

807
02:24:57,354 --> 02:24:58,946
The third one was:

808
02:24:59,571 --> 02:25:00,798
The flower...

809
02:25:01,274 --> 02:25:03,028
Marina's flower

810
02:25:03,565 --> 02:25:04,588
is

811
02:25:04,953 --> 02:25:06,240
orange.

812
02:25:08,444 --> 02:25:10,471
The fourth one was

813
02:25:10,871 --> 02:25:12,057
a question:

814
02:25:15,158 --> 02:25:17,621
What color is

815
02:25:18,199 --> 02:25:19,617
Andreea's book?

816
02:25:20,722 --> 02:25:23,915
And the fifth one was the
answer to the question.

817
02:25:24,847 --> 02:25:27,614
Andreea's book is...

818
02:25:29,347 --> 02:25:30,462
is pink.

819
02:25:35,906 --> 02:25:37,305
Who's Andreea?

820
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:39,909
Andreea...

821
02:25:40,029 --> 02:25:42,676
is both a girl from our class,

822
02:25:42,929 --> 02:25:46,963
and from teacher's book. Teacher has
a book for getting words.

823
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:50,298
And I also have a
classmate Andreea.

824
02:25:50,418 --> 02:25:52,669
- And how do you get along with Andreea?
- Very well.

825
02:25:53,561 --> 02:25:56,217
She's almost my best
friend from the class.

826
02:26:02,588 --> 02:26:06,034
Should I give a notice that I'm coming home,
each time I'm coming home?

827
02:26:06,154 --> 02:26:10,362
No, tell me, should I give a notice
each time I'm coming home?

828
02:26:11,231 --> 02:26:15,863
I don't know, maybe you'd like me to
give a notice 2 weeks in advance.

829
02:26:17,049 --> 02:26:18,164
Listen to me:

830
02:26:18,284 --> 02:26:21,255
When I come home, I want
to be able to get into the house.

831
02:26:21,774 --> 02:26:25,230
When I come home, I want
to be able to get into the house.

832
02:26:25,350 --> 02:26:26,355
Yes.

833
02:26:28,544 --> 02:26:29,639
Exactly.

834
02:26:33,438 --> 02:26:34,594
Say again?

835
02:26:36,712 --> 02:26:37,573
Enough!

836
02:26:37,693 --> 02:26:40,482
Enough, I don't want
to talk anymore! Enough!

837
02:26:40,602 --> 02:26:41,648
Bye!

838
02:26:45,454 --> 02:26:47,816
Why didn't grandpa
come and get me?

839
02:26:49,336 --> 02:26:52,518
- What did you say?
- Why didn't grandpa come and get me?

840
02:26:58,309 --> 02:27:01,208
Can't you see we can't
get into the house?

841
02:27:12,755 --> 02:27:15,370
Can't you see we can't
get into the house?

842
02:27:19,775 --> 02:27:22,167
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

843
02:27:25,726 --> 02:27:28,838
Shouldn't you better take
me to mom, at work?

844
02:27:39,034 --> 02:27:40,960
Is that what you thought?

845
02:27:41,325 --> 02:27:42,207
Yes.

846
02:27:50,759 --> 02:27:52,908
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, is Mrs. Mioara in?

847
02:27:53,028 --> 02:27:55,057
- What?
- Is Mrs. Mioara in?

848
02:27:55,177 --> 02:27:56,060
Yes.

849
02:27:57,029 --> 02:27:58,640
OK, I understand.

850
02:28:00,809 --> 02:28:02,005
Your hand.

851
02:28:02,390 --> 02:28:04,635
You think I can deal
with all your messes?

852
02:28:04,755 --> 02:28:06,571
You're very much wrong.

853
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:09,658
I gave him that money.

854
02:28:09,778 --> 02:28:11,136
There's someone
at the door.

855
02:28:11,256 --> 02:28:13,183
Is that how you figured it?

856
02:28:13,303 --> 02:28:14,754
You give him a little
something for the help.

857
02:28:15,028 --> 02:28:16,721
What are we doing here?

858
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:19,138
What are we doing here?!

859
02:28:19,827 --> 02:28:22,715
The man has a schedule.
He'll go and leave you hanging.

860
02:28:22,991 --> 02:28:25,068
- Hello.
- Just look at him.

861
02:28:25,413 --> 02:28:27,896
I invite him to the table
and he gets under it.

862
02:28:28,016 --> 02:28:29,710
I have something to ask from you.

863
02:28:29,943 --> 02:28:32,295
Don't tell me the
little one's yours!

864
02:28:32,558 --> 02:28:33,663
Yes, she is.

865
02:28:35,096 --> 02:28:36,575
How are you, pretty?

866
02:28:37,447 --> 02:28:39,494
- What do you say?
- Hello.

867
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:41,471
Is she the youngest?

868
02:28:42,059 --> 02:28:43,721
No, she's Luminita.

869
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:46,084
The youngest is Lacramioara.

870
02:28:46,204 --> 02:28:48,071
Very good. I wish her health.

871
02:28:48,191 --> 02:28:49,682
What did you want to ask?

872
02:28:50,827 --> 02:28:52,784
Pusa left and locked the door.

873
02:28:52,904 --> 02:28:55,804
We can't get in, and I don't know
where to leave Luminita.

874
02:28:55,924 --> 02:28:58,480
And I wanted to ask
you, if possible,

875
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:01,226
to let her stay Here until
Pusa comes back.

876
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:03,552
Don't you have the key?

877
02:29:03,672 --> 02:29:05,924
I only have the key for
the bottom lock.

878
02:29:06,044 --> 02:29:09,440
They locked the top also, and
left us standing outside.

879
02:29:09,988 --> 02:29:11,518
And whose are these?

880
02:29:13,230 --> 02:29:14,254
Ours.

881
02:29:15,105 --> 02:29:16,139
I see.

882
02:29:17,335 --> 02:29:19,787
But I have things to do,
and can't keep my eye on her.

883
02:29:19,907 --> 02:29:22,585
And I'll have to be
going soon.

884
02:29:24,508 --> 02:29:25,917
Well...

885
02:29:26,555 --> 02:29:30,619
You can have her sit somewhere and do
her homework. She won't bother you.

886
02:29:33,123 --> 02:29:34,390
I mean, Pusa...

887
02:29:35,888 --> 02:29:38,584
I spoke with her.
She'll be back in 3 hours.

888
02:29:38,704 --> 02:29:40,277
Well, come on then.

889
02:29:40,397 --> 02:29:41,625
Come inside.

890
02:29:41,745 --> 02:29:43,074
- It's OK?
- Yes.

891
02:29:43,194 --> 02:29:44,128
Thank you.

892
02:29:44,248 --> 02:29:46,388
- Viorel?! - Yes.
- How are you?

893
02:29:46,508 --> 02:29:47,584
I'm fine.

894
02:29:49,307 --> 02:29:51,820
- And how are you?
- Fine, fine.

895
02:29:52,813 --> 02:29:54,039
Um, what...

896
02:29:54,718 --> 02:29:56,654
- What grade are you in?
- The first.

897
02:29:56,856 --> 02:29:58,600
Yea? What school?

898
02:29:59,228 --> 02:30:01,377
At number 139.

899
02:30:01,497 --> 02:30:03,836
- And what are these?
- Some flowers.

900
02:30:03,956 --> 02:30:05,418
- You made them?
- Yes.

901
02:30:05,538 --> 02:30:06,411
Bravo.

902
02:30:07,242 --> 02:30:08,722
You look good, too.

903
02:30:09,968 --> 02:30:12,502
I'm here with my nephew...

904
02:30:13,090 --> 02:30:16,972
who wants to scam me with
some kitchen furniture.

905
02:30:17,092 --> 02:30:18,482
He's got a business.

906
02:30:18,602 --> 02:30:21,695
So, if I've got a business,
I'm looking to scam you?!

907
02:30:22,202 --> 02:30:23,519
I know you well.

908
02:30:23,894 --> 02:30:26,377
If only I didn't know
you just as well.

909
02:30:28,953 --> 02:30:30,321
Go on, show me.

910
02:30:30,441 --> 02:30:33,017
Three days we've been talking:
the money, the money...

911
02:30:33,939 --> 02:30:35,763
- Allow me.
- OK.

912
02:30:36,666 --> 02:30:39,433
No offence, Viorel, but
I just finished cleaning.

913
02:30:40,578 --> 02:30:41,967
Give 'em here.

914
02:30:43,750 --> 02:30:46,882
I'm getting sick of holding
a rag all day long.

915
02:30:47,481 --> 02:30:48,484
Alright...

916
02:30:49,639 --> 02:30:52,416
Instead of that big cupboard...

917
02:30:54,281 --> 02:30:56,217
- Aren't you hot?
- No.

918
02:30:57,441 --> 02:30:58,951
You're hot, right?

919
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:00,735
The air...

920
02:31:00,988 --> 02:31:02,792
It's so stuffy in this room.

921
02:31:03,258 --> 02:31:06,005
I'll have to let the air in.
What are you doing?

922
02:31:07,369 --> 02:31:09,345
I'll do all the work
for you.

923
02:31:09,465 --> 02:31:11,838
Relax, don't bother yourselves.

924
02:31:13,207 --> 02:31:14,879
You must be tired.

925
02:31:15,152 --> 02:31:17,484
What can we do?
That's the situation.

926
02:31:17,747 --> 02:31:19,825
I'll leave it here
for you, OK?

927
02:31:20,823 --> 02:31:23,499
... and, instead of that,
we'll have a table.

928
02:31:23,619 --> 02:31:25,634
You can have
4 chairs for it.

929
02:31:25,754 --> 02:31:27,732
Eat like regular people.

930
02:31:27,852 --> 02:31:30,408
You won't have to be
cramped up anymore.

931
02:31:31,077 --> 02:31:33,945
The price. I want to
know the price.

932
02:31:37,236 --> 02:31:38,736
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

933
02:31:39,648 --> 02:31:41,371
Can I leave this bag here?

934
02:31:41,491 --> 02:31:43,398
- Yes, leave it.
- OK?

935
02:31:46,713 --> 02:31:47,757
It's...

936
02:31:49,014 --> 02:31:50,706
How can they be cheaper?

937
02:31:50,826 --> 02:31:53,737
Didn't I say I'm only
charging for materials?

938
02:31:54,538 --> 02:31:56,443
What do you want, then?

939
02:31:56,563 --> 02:32:00,700
For me to pay for everything, and then
have you buy me a drink in return?

940
02:32:04,674 --> 02:32:06,630
Let's come to an
understanding.

941
02:32:07,319 --> 02:32:10,309
Give me a keg of beer at
the end, and that's that.

942
02:32:11,327 --> 02:32:12,878
This is the price.

943
02:32:14,246 --> 02:32:17,236
- What'll be going in the corner?
- The fridge.

944
02:32:17,356 --> 02:32:20,084
- You won't forget, right?
- How could I forget?

945
02:32:20,204 --> 02:32:21,055
Come on.

946
02:32:21,175 --> 02:32:23,954
Dinner's ready. You're driving me
crazy with your cigarettes.

947
02:32:24,074 --> 02:32:26,761
Should I set you a plate?
Are you eating with us?

948
02:32:27,795 --> 02:32:30,065
Dear, don't rush us.
We're coming.

949
02:32:31,464 --> 02:32:33,582
Didn't you say you
wanted to eat?

950
02:32:33,702 --> 02:32:35,224
God, forgive me!

951
02:32:35,344 --> 02:32:39,146
Now, what's most important.
I almost forgot.

952
02:32:46,609 --> 02:32:47,390
Hey...

953
02:32:47,947 --> 02:32:50,400
Did this girl of yours
eat anything today?

954
02:32:51,950 --> 02:32:54,140
Did this girl of yours
eat anything today?

955
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:56,461
- Have you eaten today?
- Yes.

956
02:32:57,008 --> 02:32:58,346
I didn't hear you.

957
02:32:58,731 --> 02:33:01,214
- What did you eat?
- I had a sandwich this morning,

958
02:33:01,334 --> 02:33:04,619
and I had another one at school,
and drank my milk.

959
02:33:04,739 --> 02:33:06,150
Milk isn't food.

960
02:33:06,788 --> 02:33:08,684
I'll give you some
boeuf salad.

961
02:33:08,804 --> 02:33:10,498
Mrs. Mioara, no.

962
02:33:11,136 --> 02:33:11,998
Listen...

963
02:33:12,565 --> 02:33:15,677
- Do you pus mayonnaise in it?
- Of course I do.

964
02:33:16,996 --> 02:33:20,898
Don't give her any. She's allergic to it,
and any kind of preservative.

965
02:33:21,018 --> 02:33:24,253
I made it in the house, with
my own hands. It's fresh.

966
02:33:24,373 --> 02:33:26,615
She's also allergic to eggs.

967
02:33:26,735 --> 02:33:29,683
- Make sure you don't give her
anything with eggs. - OK.

968
02:33:30,291 --> 02:33:33,636
- It's serious, you know.
- I'll give her something else.

969
02:33:34,974 --> 02:33:37,021
Do you want some cherry-brandy?

970
02:33:38,110 --> 02:33:39,702
Let's drink some cherry-brandy.

971
02:33:39,822 --> 02:33:41,394
No, no thank you.

972
02:33:44,516 --> 02:33:45,986
- Leo!
- Yes.

973
02:33:46,106 --> 02:33:49,543
- Let's drink some cherry-brandy.
- I'm driving, thanks.

974
02:33:49,786 --> 02:33:51,803
Come on, what's
the big deal?

975
02:33:52,178 --> 02:33:54,520
I got it: she can't
have any eggs.

976
02:33:56,263 --> 02:33:59,273
I'll find something else
for her, don't worry.

977
02:33:59,790 --> 02:34:02,648
Something else. Anything
except for eggs.

978
02:34:10,877 --> 02:34:13,198
What are we gonna
do with this boy?

979
02:34:13,623 --> 02:34:16,096
- What?
- I need to use the bathroom.

980
02:34:16,532 --> 02:34:19,502
How many times a day do
you go to the bathroom?

981
02:34:20,796 --> 02:34:23,410
- The bathroom's over here, right?
- Yes.

982
02:34:27,617 --> 02:34:29,005
It's occupied.

983
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:31,859
You should get a job.

984
02:34:32,436 --> 02:34:35,071
Just sit here until
you can go in.

985
02:34:36,034 --> 02:34:36,977
OK?

986
02:34:55,014 --> 02:34:56,575
You see them, right?

987
02:34:57,259 --> 02:35:01,202
- Your backpack, the gym bag.
Don't forget them. - OK.

988
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:05,134
- Don't forget them.
- OK.

989
02:35:16,206 --> 02:35:18,284
I'm off. Goodbye.

990
02:35:20,372 --> 02:35:21,730
Goodbye.

991
02:35:22,247 --> 02:35:23,372
Daddy...

992
02:35:25,306 --> 02:35:27,313
I don't want to stay here.

993
02:35:27,433 --> 02:35:30,526
I don't want to stay here,
I want to go to Pusa.

994
02:35:33,516 --> 02:35:35,847
Leave your dad alone,
he's got business.

995
02:35:36,219 --> 02:35:37,110
Listen...

996
02:35:38,377 --> 02:35:42,543
I have some gumbo stew with
mutton. Can I give her some?

997
02:35:43,516 --> 02:35:45,137
Would she have it?

998
02:35:45,685 --> 02:35:47,073
What kind of stew?

999
02:35:47,408 --> 02:35:49,404
Gumbo stew with mutton.

1000
02:35:53,631 --> 02:35:54,573
Yes.

1001
02:35:55,075 --> 02:35:56,504
Yes, give her some.

1002
02:35:57,527 --> 02:36:00,335
You sit at the table and
do your homework.

1003
02:36:00,455 --> 02:36:03,902
- Miss Mioara will help you, and
Pusa returns in 3 hours. - Yes.

1004
02:36:04,022 --> 02:36:07,044
We'll manage. We'll have
a great time together.

1005
02:36:08,362 --> 02:36:09,639
A great time.

1006
02:36:11,301 --> 02:36:12,497
- Yes?
- Yes.

1007
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:16,188
- Thank you very much.
- Don't worry.

1008
02:36:16,308 --> 02:36:17,748
Thank you very much.

1009
02:36:17,982 --> 02:36:20,171
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye.

1010
02:36:20,291 --> 02:36:21,549
- Bye, daddy.

1011
02:36:38,742 --> 02:36:40,303
PASTRY

1012
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:45,338
DISTRICT 3 POLICE
10TH PRECINCT

1013
02:39:50,356 --> 02:39:51,907
Your ID card, please.

1014
02:39:54,410 --> 02:39:56,448
You want me to get
you something?

1015
02:39:56,863 --> 02:39:58,586
Your ID card, please.

1016
02:39:58,706 --> 02:40:00,431
You don't want anything?

1017
02:40:01,265 --> 02:40:03,100
- No.
- Broke again?

1018
02:40:07,823 --> 02:40:10,357
Empty your pockets
on this desk.

1019
02:40:11,953 --> 02:40:14,274
Empty your pockets.
Give this to me.

1020
02:40:39,231 --> 02:40:40,590
Come over here.

1021
02:40:40,954 --> 02:40:42,100
Over here.

1022
02:40:42,393 --> 02:40:44,106
Place your hands
on the wall.

1023
02:40:44,226 --> 02:40:47,208
Higher. A bit higher.
Spread your legs.

1024
02:40:48,900 --> 02:40:49,802
Good.

1025
02:41:09,491 --> 02:41:11,244
Could you be more careful?

1026
02:41:11,364 --> 02:41:13,170
Relax, nothing happened.

1027
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:23,579
Sit down here.

1028
02:41:24,443 --> 02:41:25,528
Sit down.

1029
02:41:25,648 --> 02:41:29,399
- Was it necessary to rough me up?
- Sit down and relax. Nothing happened.

1030
02:41:29,519 --> 02:41:30,545
Sit down.

1031
02:41:51,932 --> 02:41:53,189
It's expired.

1032
02:41:53,847 --> 02:41:54,881
Mister...

1033
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,520
- It's expired.
- Yes, I know.

1034
02:41:58,159 --> 02:42:00,419
I should have
renewed it in July.

1035
02:42:19,543 --> 02:42:21,124
This is a 12 caliber.

1036
02:42:31,834 --> 02:42:34,186
Lica! How are you?
We're over here.

1037
02:42:35,554 --> 02:42:38,169
Brats, I'm never getting
rid of you, am I?

1038
02:42:47,091 --> 02:42:49,047
Sir, this way.

1039
02:42:55,471 --> 02:42:57,710
He had a tough
time with it,

1040
02:42:57,830 --> 02:43:01,187
with the screws from the lit.
He needed a mouse wrench.

1041
02:43:01,307 --> 02:43:04,258
And, when he opened the
plastic lid from the motor,

1042
02:43:04,378 --> 02:43:07,065
you know, the one
between rocker cams,

1043
02:43:07,185 --> 02:43:10,095
he pulled out a hatful
of cherry seeds.

1044
02:43:10,215 --> 02:43:11,180
What?

1045
02:43:11,441 --> 02:43:12,617
What? Nothing.

1046
02:43:12,972 --> 02:43:15,475
- Tell me. - Don't worry,
finish your work.

1047
02:43:18,313 --> 02:43:21,881
How they got in there, I don't know.
He was even ashamed to tell me.

1048
02:43:22,001 --> 02:43:23,340
Cherry seeds...

1049
02:43:24,124 --> 02:43:26,790
I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

1050
02:43:27,236 --> 02:43:30,428
So I told him to keep them so
I can show you tomorrow.

1051
02:43:30,548 --> 02:43:32,232
I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

1052
02:43:32,352 --> 02:43:34,958
- Have you identified the murders?
- Yes, 4, apparently.

1053
02:43:35,272 --> 02:43:37,117
Two men and two women.

1054
02:43:39,772 --> 02:43:42,884
- What do you say, boys? Should
we send someone? - Where?

1055
02:43:50,469 --> 02:43:51,513
- Coffee?

1056
02:43:51,633 --> 02:43:52,578
Yes.

1057
02:43:55,526 --> 02:43:57,087
Do you want some?

1058
02:44:01,719 --> 02:44:04,303
What, you think we're
getting too high class?

1059
02:44:04,330 --> 02:44:06,215
No, boss, but it's
bottled water.

1060
02:44:06,335 --> 02:44:09,782
I was thinking that a coffee
can get expensive this way.

1061
02:44:10,461 --> 02:44:11,404
Alright.

1062
02:44:11,524 --> 02:44:14,313
It's more about Giardia infection
than being high class.

1063
02:44:14,433 --> 02:44:17,895
Tap water is riddled with
Giardia in all of Bucharest.

1064
02:44:19,355 --> 02:44:21,017
- Listen up...
- All of it!

1065
02:44:21,137 --> 02:44:23,165
Ask the mechanic
to add up again.

1066
02:44:23,285 --> 02:44:25,993
Ask him nicely to add
up once more.

1067
02:44:26,113 --> 02:44:27,802
Boss, he's an honest man.

1068
02:44:27,922 --> 02:44:30,914
I wouldn't have stuck my nose
out for him if he was some...

1069
02:44:31,126 --> 02:44:32,900
deadbeat or something.

1070
02:44:33,020 --> 02:44:36,164
The old man's been fixing
his car there for years.

1071
02:44:36,284 --> 02:44:39,144
The man has his garage
in the neighborhood.

1072
02:44:39,264 --> 02:44:41,110
Go see if there's
been any report.

1073
02:44:41,230 --> 02:44:44,364
Everyone goes to see him, he
never gave any reason for doubt.

1074
02:44:44,484 --> 02:44:48,600
You'd never hear that Petrisor pulled
one on him, or something like that.

1075
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:49,656
The phone!

1076
02:44:49,776 --> 02:44:51,245
You always do this.

1077
02:44:51,365 --> 02:44:53,586
Or should I answer it?

1078
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:00,343
Hello.

1079
02:45:01,732 --> 02:45:03,039
Yes, it's me.

1080
02:45:07,084 --> 02:45:08,797
Kid, official duty.

1081
02:45:09,678 --> 02:45:12,699
To Dragnea. Get it
sealed and stamped.

1082
02:45:12,819 --> 02:45:14,391
You know what to do.

1083
02:45:15,797 --> 02:45:17,591
Hold on. What's his name?

1084
02:45:17,711 --> 02:45:19,749
- Who?
- This mechanic of yours.

1085
02:45:19,869 --> 02:45:23,297
- Petrisor. Petrisor Valentin.
- Alright. Gimme his number.

1086
02:45:31,290 --> 02:45:32,243
Got it?

1087
02:45:37,367 --> 02:45:39,465
This is just for your
peace of mind.

1088
02:45:39,585 --> 02:45:42,871
So you don't think that I
added a little extra for myself.

1089
02:45:42,991 --> 02:45:44,503
You always do this.

1090
02:45:44,623 --> 02:45:46,641
I'm the fool for getting involved.

1091
02:45:46,761 --> 02:45:49,847
- Nevermind. - I should have
known from the start.

1092
02:45:52,066 --> 02:45:53,840
- Tell me.
- He's arrived.

1093
02:45:53,960 --> 02:45:56,039
- Really?
- Yes, he's downstairs.

1094
02:45:57,583 --> 02:45:59,540
- I'll be back in 2 minutes.
- OK.

1095
02:45:59,660 --> 02:46:00,715
2 minutes.

1096
02:46:01,023 --> 02:46:02,158
Let's go.

1097
02:46:50,465 --> 02:46:53,597
- Can I turn on my cell phone?
- Yes, you can.

1098
02:46:55,904 --> 02:46:57,192
Remain there.

1099
02:47:02,938 --> 02:47:04,356
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1100
02:47:04,476 --> 02:47:07,477
Can I move from this chair
near the window?

1101
02:47:07,597 --> 02:47:10,842
There's a terrible draft
on this hallway.

1102
02:47:11,187 --> 02:47:13,802
- There? - Yes, I'm getting
a draft on this chair.

1103
02:47:13,922 --> 02:47:15,604
- Yes, sure.
- So I can?

1104
02:47:15,724 --> 02:47:16,638
Sure.

1105
02:47:30,528 --> 02:47:32,089
I brought you a coffee.

1106
02:47:32,768 --> 02:47:34,684
It's got everything
it needs.

1107
02:47:40,733 --> 02:47:42,659
Call me when you
finish, OK?

1108
02:47:51,594 --> 02:47:53,611
Who did you say
you killed?

1109
02:47:55,112 --> 02:47:58,578
The notary public,
Zoltan Istvan

1110
02:47:59,723 --> 02:48:04,021
and Dan Livinski and
Rodica Livinski, my in-laws.

1111
02:48:06,402 --> 02:48:07,619
- Doru?
- Yes.

1112
02:48:07,739 --> 02:48:09,848
Grab something
to take notes.

1113
02:48:10,971 --> 02:48:11,822
Yes.

1114
02:48:12,359 --> 02:48:13,525
Right away.

1115
02:48:15,167 --> 02:48:18,146
Tell me once again exactly
who the victims were.

1116
02:48:18,653 --> 02:48:20,204
Tell you their names?

1117
02:48:20,782 --> 02:48:23,255
- Zoltan Istvan and...
- Wait a minute.

1118
02:48:25,992 --> 02:48:26,985
Ready.

1119
02:48:27,583 --> 02:48:29,478
Zoltan Istvan...

1120
02:48:30,096 --> 02:48:33,147
and Dan Livinski and
Rodica Livinski.

1121
02:48:41,876 --> 02:48:43,518
Rodica is...

1122
02:48:44,035 --> 02:48:46,913
the wife of Dan Livinski,
and my mother-in-law.

1123
02:48:47,461 --> 02:48:48,991
My ex mother-in-law.

1124
02:48:49,843 --> 02:48:51,697
Of course she's
your "ex".

1125
02:48:55,741 --> 02:48:56,816
Is that all?

1126
02:48:58,559 --> 02:49:00,607
Yes, there was one
more woman.

1127
02:49:00,727 --> 02:49:04,042
When I shot Zoli in the
underground parking lot

1128
02:49:04,162 --> 02:49:07,112
there was a woman with him,
but I don't know her.

1129
02:49:07,776 --> 02:49:09,042
Zoltan Istvan.

1130
02:49:09,640 --> 02:49:10,816
And...

1131
02:49:13,978 --> 02:49:17,394
I don't think she was his wife.
They didn't seem close.

1132
02:49:17,514 --> 02:49:19,279
Is he your relative, too?

1133
02:49:21,451 --> 02:49:23,397
He's my ex wife's notary.

1134
02:49:24,239 --> 02:49:26,945
They met 3 years ago
at Geoagiu Bai.

1135
02:49:28,506 --> 02:49:30,766
4 years as of June.

1136
02:49:32,403 --> 02:49:35,008
Where did all these
killings take place?

1137
02:49:36,411 --> 02:49:38,478
I shot Zoltan Istvan

1138
02:49:38,598 --> 02:49:42,380
in the underground parking
lot of Intercontinental Hotel

1139
02:49:42,796 --> 02:49:45,228
yesterday, at about 9,

1140
02:49:45,605 --> 02:49:48,362
and I shot my in-laws
at their home,

1141
02:49:48,482 --> 02:49:50,267
in Chitila,

1142
02:49:52,548 --> 02:49:54,808
at 23a Lunca Siretului street.

1143
02:49:56,505 --> 02:49:58,481
Where do these
people live?

1144
02:49:58,775 --> 02:49:59,657
Who?

1145
02:49:59,777 --> 02:50:00,954
The victims.

1146
02:50:03,539 --> 02:50:06,599
My in-laws live at 23a
Lunca Siretului street,

1147
02:50:06,719 --> 02:50:08,910
in the Chitila neighborhood.

1148
02:50:11,508 --> 02:50:13,859
And Zoltan Istvan has...

1149
02:50:14,792 --> 02:50:18,147
an apartment on Fainari street,
at number 17.

1150
02:50:18,942 --> 02:50:22,013
It's the street connecting
Lizeanu to Mosilor.

1151
02:50:23,898 --> 02:50:26,412
I don't know if he
actually lives there.

1152
02:50:26,532 --> 02:50:29,432
It's rather a notary office.

1153
02:50:29,698 --> 02:50:33,164
He has another one in Satu Mare,
and another in Debrecen.

1154
02:50:36,417 --> 02:50:39,012
I don't know about the
lady he was with.

1155
02:50:40,846 --> 02:50:42,599
Why did you kill them?

1156
02:50:48,944 --> 02:50:52,573
I want you to know I realize
that what I'm saying...

1157
02:50:53,079 --> 02:50:55,015
cannot be qualified
as a confession.

1158
02:50:55,329 --> 02:50:56,383
But...

1159
02:50:57,924 --> 02:51:00,519
Because you need
it for the record,

1160
02:51:00,639 --> 02:51:03,397
I dunno, declarations
and forms to fill out...

1161
02:51:03,722 --> 02:51:05,749
I'll try to be precise.

1162
02:51:12,764 --> 02:51:13,676
Yes...

1163
02:51:17,506 --> 02:51:18,884
Amalia is...

1164
02:51:20,050 --> 02:51:22,340
Amalia is careless
like a child...

1165
02:51:23,212 --> 02:51:24,712
and she easily...

1166
02:51:26,952 --> 02:51:28,219
believes...

1167
02:51:28,967 --> 02:51:31,288
what certain people say...

1168
02:51:31,694 --> 02:51:32,778
or utter.

1169
02:51:41,857 --> 02:51:44,999
I didn't get a divorce because
I wanted a divorce.

1170
02:51:46,266 --> 02:51:47,604
Do you understand?

1171
02:51:49,025 --> 02:51:53,079
And, when you get a divorce, it's not
like separating from just a human.

1172
02:51:57,909 --> 02:52:00,169
I couldn't leave
things like that.

1173
02:52:02,470 --> 02:52:04,953
I don't know what
you think, but...

1174
02:52:05,308 --> 02:52:07,406
I don't personally
believe that

1175
02:52:07,526 --> 02:52:09,119
the justice system
has access to

1176
02:52:09,239 --> 02:52:12,655
the complex relationship
between me and my wife.

1177
02:52:17,233 --> 02:52:18,449
Who's Amalia?

1178
02:52:19,645 --> 02:52:21,135
Amalia is my wife.

1179
02:52:21,417 --> 02:52:22,665
My ex wife.

1180
02:52:23,293 --> 02:52:26,831
Her name's also Livinski now,
she assumed her maiden name.

1181
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:35,080
What do you do,
Mr. Ghenghea?

1182
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:37,808
I am a specialized
consultant,

1183
02:52:38,132 --> 02:52:40,351
metallurgical engineer at

1184
02:52:41,193 --> 02:52:43,626
The Bucharest Heavy
Machinery Factory for

1185
02:52:43,746 --> 02:52:46,311
The Chemical and
Petrochemical Industry.

1186
02:52:47,507 --> 02:52:48,886
And your address?

1187
02:52:49,139 --> 02:52:50,365
Where I live?

1188
02:52:52,548 --> 02:52:54,342
No. 5, Fetesti Street.

1189
02:52:55,072 --> 02:52:55,964
Balta Alba.

1190
02:52:56,084 --> 02:52:57,444
No. 5, Fetesti Street.

1191
02:52:57,646 --> 02:52:58,984
Building H27

1192
02:52:59,104 --> 02:53:02,449
entrance B, 2nd floor,
apartment 18.

1193
02:53:03,339 --> 02:53:04,343
Building?

1194
02:53:07,049 --> 02:53:08,204
H27

1195
02:53:08,660 --> 02:53:11,245
entrance B, 2nd floor,
apartment 18.

1196
02:53:15,580 --> 02:53:16,442
OK.

1197
02:53:21,124 --> 02:53:22,836
You're from
Bucharest?

1198
02:53:23,515 --> 02:53:25,218
Yes, I'm from
Bucharest.

1199
02:53:25,338 --> 02:53:27,696
My mother was
born in Silistra,

1200
02:53:27,816 --> 02:53:28,871
in Bulgaria.

1201
02:53:28,991 --> 02:53:33,615
And my father was born in Tandarei,
but I was born here, at Polizu Hospital.

1202
02:53:42,034 --> 02:53:44,648
I dunno but, I came
to the police...

1203
02:53:44,943 --> 02:53:47,345
surrendered myself
and my weapon...

1204
02:53:47,770 --> 02:53:50,963
and the officer on duty
grabbed me by the armpits.

1205
02:53:54,484 --> 02:53:55,872
I surrendered...

1206
02:53:55,992 --> 02:53:58,436
isn't it obvious I
did it willingly?

1207
02:54:00,078 --> 02:54:01,011
Yes.

1208
02:54:02,247 --> 02:54:05,946
I think that this officer
didn't understand at all.

1209
02:54:06,635 --> 02:54:09,301
The man to whom you
were speaking earlier.

1210
02:54:15,321 --> 02:54:17,399
- Any more coffee left?
- Yes.

1211
02:54:23,561 --> 02:54:26,186
Do you have any children,
Mr. Ghenghea?

1212
02:54:26,963 --> 02:54:28,716
Yes, I have 2 girls.

1213
02:54:30,591 --> 02:54:32,030
What are their ages?

1214
02:54:32,150 --> 02:54:34,047
The youngest is
4 years old,

1215
02:54:34,167 --> 02:54:36,844
and the old one is 7,
she's in 1st grade.

1216
02:55:03,411 --> 02:55:05,620
Don't get me
wrong, but...

1217
02:55:06,422 --> 02:55:09,938
I've listened to you and seen
the way you think you...

1218
02:55:10,253 --> 02:55:13,871
know and understand and
are perceiving me, and...

1219
02:55:14,418 --> 02:55:15,898
I'm getting scared.

1220
02:55:17,778 --> 02:55:20,038
I don't know if you
understand me.

1221
02:55:25,613 --> 02:55:28,846
- Should we get his statement?
- I would think so.

1222
02:55:38,569 --> 02:55:39,491
Yes.

1223
02:55:42,360 --> 02:55:43,545
I understood.

1224
02:55:45,025 --> 02:55:46,302
And the others?

1225
02:55:50,741 --> 02:55:52,018
Our people left?

1226
02:55:55,598 --> 02:55:56,480
OK.

1227
02:56:02,125 --> 02:56:03,879
- Well?
- It's all real.

1228
02:56:08,328 --> 02:56:10,031
Take his statement.

1229
02:56:20,396 --> 02:56:21,390
Here...

1230
02:56:22,211 --> 02:56:24,055
Write a statement for us.

1231
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:26,447
"The undersigned",
name, surname,

1232
02:56:26,567 --> 02:56:29,153
living in Bucharest,
born on the date...

1233
02:56:29,822 --> 02:56:33,785
And so forth. Write down, nice and
detailed, everything that happened.

1234
02:56:33,905 --> 02:56:36,977
If you run out of paper,
I'll give you some more.

1235
02:56:44,691 --> 02:56:46,749
- Can I have a pen?
- Yes.

1236
02:56:52,168 --> 02:56:53,313
Here...

1237
02:56:53,433 --> 02:56:55,675
A pen with the
Steaua FC logo.

1238
02:57:00,877 --> 02:57:02,620
I'm going to the can.
