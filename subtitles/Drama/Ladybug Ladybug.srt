Hey, easy kiddo.

132
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:30,063
I'm sure you're not even
the real Santa Claus.

133
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,273
Hey, that's enough,
what's gotten into you, kids?

134
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,249
Aren't you ashamed
to lash out on Santa Claus?

135
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,420
This young man is right.

136
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:37,926
Apologize right now.

137
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:39,725
Sorry, Santa Claus...

138
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,321
It's not a big deal, kids.

139
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,250
Have a Merry Christmas anyway.

140
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,815
Sorry sir, is everything alright?

141
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,692
Don't worry,
I'm an old tough Santa Claus.

142
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:51,428
But, and you?
What are you doing out a this time?

143
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:52,293
Did you get lost?

144
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:57,108
Dressed like this, you must be cold.

145
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:58,601
Do you want a cup of
hot chocolate?

146
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,744
I have some left.

147
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,190
With pleasure, sir.

148
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:02,626
There's nothing better.

149
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:05,078
Except maybe, a piece of camembert...

150
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:08,539
You're lucky, kid, I have some left from my lunch sandwich.

151
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,321

You're not lost?

155
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:24,552
 It's my first Christmas
without my mother, sir.

156
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,648
My father, he...

157
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,023
He doesn't know how to deal with it.

158
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,059
I understand, you know.

159
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:31,713
But your father must be
wondering where you are.

160
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,847
And worrying a lot about you.

161
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,748
Now that you got some fresh air
and thought a bit...

162
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,053
Don't you think it'd be good
to go back home?

163
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,529
You're right sir.

164
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,346
That's good.  A family reunited under
the tree, that's the spirit of Christmas.

165
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,212
I'll drop you off by sledge.

166
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,552
Come here, Plagg.

167
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,916
Alright, but wear this.

168
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,099
The friend who gave it to me
would be happy for you to have it.

169
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,321
A gift?

170
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,142
For me?

171
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:00,203
Everybody has the right
to have a Christmas present.

172
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,418
Thank you, my boy.

189
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,921
Who could even get akumatized
on Christmas Eve?

190
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,068
Footprints...

191
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:37,411
And you, sir?  Where are you going to
celebrate Christmas?

192
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,689
Me?  Well, everywhere in Paris.

193
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:41,111
The entire world, even.

194
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:43,830
You're all alone, huh?

195
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,254
Listen, here's what we're gonna do.

196
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,298
Get me back and
stay at our place for dinner.

197
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:50,677
Help me bring back the
Christmas spirit, sir.

198
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:53,539
Well, Okay, but I won't be able to stay long.

199
00:10:53,564 --> 00:10:55,588
It's that I have a lot of work
on Christmas Eve.

200
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,035
Thanks, Santa.

201
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,894
Adrien?
It's you?

202
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:07,040
And you, who are you?

203
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,223
Well, it's obvious, no?

204
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:09,617
I'm Santa Claus.

205
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:10,578
Of course.

206
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,929
And me, I'm the Easter Bunny.

207
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:14,045
Aren't you ashamed to bother us
on Christmas Eve?

208
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,666
Get lost or I'll send by bodyguard.

209
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:16,905
Father, you're mistaken.

210
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,952
No, he's right.

211
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:19,294
Your father saw through his plans.

212
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,676
This man is a supervillain
under the Papillon's hold.

213
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:22,700
Wh-What?

214
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,640
You've all lost your minds.

215
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,796
No, Ladybug.

216
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,811
Stop!  This man isn't akumatized.

217
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:30,604
I know how to recognize an akumatized.

218
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:31,961
Trust me.

219
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:35,830
Go back home, it's safer.

220
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,267
No, wait.

221
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:39,199
Adrien.
Plagg.

222
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,190
Go ponies, hup hup!

223
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,817
Are you crazy,
what's gotten in to you?

224
00:11:51,874 --> 00:11:56,638
Without realizing it, you just gave me
a wonderful Christmas present, Ladybug.

225
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,239
A poor innocent wrongly accused.

226
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,378
And the spirit of a scorned holiday.

227
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,649
It's all my akuma needs...

228
00:12:07,674 --> 00:12:10,154
...to darken this heart.

229
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:18,008
Adrien?  Where are you going?

230
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,294
To my room, of course.

231
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,186
Since my father doesn't want to celebrate Christmas.

232
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,077
You're wrong.

233
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,581
Your father came to see you,
but you were out.

234
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,154
I'll tell him you're waiting for him.

235
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,424
But this time, we'll make sure
you stay in your room.

236
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:32,957
You-

237
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,880
You aren't a supervillain?

238
00:12:34,905 --> 00:12:36,199
Of course not.

239
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,089
You read too many superhero stories, my dear.

240
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,355
I'm sorry,

241
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,503
I really thought-

242
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,725
Don't touch me.

243
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,336
You've done enough as it is.

244
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,924
No one respects
the spirit of Christmas now days.

245
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,465
They don't believe in me anymore.

246
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,278
I believe in you.

247
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,392
My dear Bother Christmas,
I am the Papillon.

248
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,386
They wrongly accused you of
being a supervillain.

249
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:12,032
In that case,
that's what you'll be from now on.

250
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,133
In return, since I was good all year,

251
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,990
I'll ask for not one, but two presents.

252
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,951
Ladybug and Chat Noir's Miraculouses.

253
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,152
And you'll have them.

254
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,053
Merry Christmas to you, Papillon.

255
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,179

00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:21,134

00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,768
I won't do anything to you.
I owe you.

270
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,050
You gave me a gift
and I won't forget it.

271
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,388
On the contrary,
I'll avenge you, even.

272
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,075
Avenge us both.

273
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,067
No, wait!

274
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:49,974
It'll be the revenge Christmas.

275
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,990
Plagg, transform me.

276
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:59,969
It looks like Santa Claus came by,
my dear Chloe.

You and us, My Lady.

285
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:37,820
Chat Noir?

286
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:38,771
Where were you?

287
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:39,990
And what happened to Adrien?

288
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:40,787
It's...

289
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,010
It's a long story.

290
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:43,867
Cats have their little secrets too.

291
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,222
Who's gonna deliver the kids their presents
to night, Bother Christmas?

292
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:52,072
All that is ancient history.

293
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:54,094
Farewell presents and Christmas spirit.

294
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,194
You should have been nice.

295
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,983
I was nice all year.

296
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,469
Obviously not enough.

297
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:03,692
I got you.

298
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:11,227
How about a little ride in the sledge,
little elves?

299
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,664
Hang on tight!

300
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:15,705
Here we go!

301
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:22,470
It's not like that he'll get his sledge license.

302
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:29,188
It's time to open your presents, kids.

303
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:31,587
I'll take care of the sledge.

304
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:32,747
I'll leave Santa to you.

305
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:48,790
Whoa, easy there.

306
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:55,112
Thank you so much.

307
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:57,066
Ladybug!

308
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,836
It's happening again.

309
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,947
Ladybug?  Chat Noir?

310
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:11,391
That's one Christmas scoop.

311
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,164
A little word for my Ladyblog?

312
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,571
Oh, erm, no no, it's not what it looks like.

313
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:19,707
No, wait.

314
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:20,564
I have another idea.

315
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,449
Lucky Charm!

316
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:29,636
Oh, top notch.

317
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,374
With that, for sure,
it's in the box.

318
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:35,637
I'm gonna need tape, scissors,
that kind of stuff.

319
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:36,566
You have that here?

320
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:37,609
Up there.

321
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:42,690
Here too.

322
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:46,722
Here.

323
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:50,237
My Christmas list.

324
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:52,581
Run by the Dupain-Cheng bakery
and bring me this.

325
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,971
We'll meet at the Eiffel Tower.

326
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:54,949
I'll explain everything there.

327
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,611
I've always dreamed of being your Santa.
