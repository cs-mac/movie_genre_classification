1
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,220
If you say "No"...

2
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:34,324
...oil wells will be ours...

3
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,258
...and we will decide
what to do with them!

4
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:50,317
Thank you.

5
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,546
If you say "No"...

6
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:59,704
...we won't sell out
to foreign interests...

7
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,111
...not even if they rub
their money in our faces,

8
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:05,412
as if they're having a feast
before starving people.

9
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,849
<i>Ambulance!</i>

10
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,788
<i>Stay with him, stay with him!
Get the mic down.</i>

11
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,089
Got a two-shot?

12
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,577
- Ambulance!
Keep down the mic, keep it down.

13
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:09,626
Keep shooting!

14
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:11,606
Somebody bring an ambulance!

15
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,669
Stay close. Watch out!

16
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,489
An ambulance, for Christ's sake!

17
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,575
Get this shot, right here!

18
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,932
Go away! Go away!
<i>Keep shooting. Bring it around.</i>

19
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,687
Go away!

20
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:26,022
Roberto, let's go.
It's dangerous out here, come on.

21
00:04:26,023 --> 00:04:28,123
Not until an ambulance arrives.

22
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:29,924
The ambulance and a doctor
are already on the way.

23
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:31,519
- Are you sure?
- Yes, positive. Let's go.

24
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
- Are you sure?
- Let's go, let's go.

25
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,232
<i>Roberto! Roberto!</i>

26
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:51,250
Come on, hurry!

27
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,451
Cut, cut, cut!

28
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,352
So, who did it? The guerillas?

29
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,701
Maybe.

30
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:35,711
Christ, you were terrific!

31
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:37,783
It was an incredible moment!

32
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,371
I'm gonna cut the film
tonight in New York...

33
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,572
...and have it flown back
down tomorrow.

34
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:46,716
We're gonna take this thing.
We're gonna take it.

35
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:49,134
When are you coming back?

36
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,729
I don't know yet, but I've gone over
everything with Miguel.

37
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,735
He's gonna be handling...

38
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:58,036
...all the print contracts,
the billboards, the posters.

39
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:01,187
He also's gonna be having
the payroll,

40
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:04,888
which includes the reporters.
I gave him a list already.

41
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:10,408
From now until the election,

42
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,102
every speech, every appearance,

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
you're gonna wear this shirt.

44
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:21,088
You keep your jacket on
till just before the finish,

45
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,749
then slowly take it off...

46
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:27,647
...and you just stand there,
let the whole country see it.

47
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:31,047
<i>"They want to hurt us,
they want to destroy us,"</i>

48
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,605
<i>"but they'll spill our blood
before they defeat us."</i>

49
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,206
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

50
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:26,349
<i>Nice trip, Mr. St. John?</i>

51
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,505
- Tired?
- I can't tell yet.

52
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,152
We booked the mixing room
for the rest of the night.

53
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,541
- Did you bring the film?
- Yeah, but I wanna clean up a bit.

54
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:35,299
I want you to stick around
when I do the cuts.

55
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:39,006
I assume you found some decent
talent for the voice-over.

56
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,495
No, I found some great talent.

57
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:42,500
He's an actor.
He does Spanish soaps here.

58
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:44,908
He used to be a radio announcer
in South America.

59
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,099
Mom, I hope you didn't wait up.

60
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:50,756
God, you look like shit.
And this is only March.

61
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:52,793
What will you look like
in November?

62
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,094
I don't know.

63
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,333
I had him talk to my friend
Patricia, and according to her,

64
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:58,334
he has a very sexy accent.

65
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:01,068
I advise you to wrap this thing up
early tonight because...

66
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,049
...Wallace Furman is coming
in the morning.

67
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,450
- For how long?
- Definitely, no longer than all day.

68
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,517
What did Ellen want?

69
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:11,620
She said some decent information,
for a change.

70
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,105
You're having dinner
tomorrow night with...

71
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:16,097
-...Senator Hastings and his wife.
- In Washington?

72
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:18,653
Yeah, the plane will be
at LaGuardia at 6:00.

73
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:20,927
Even with traffic, you should
get there by 8:30.

74
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,773
You pulled the file
from the last campaign?

75
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:25,040
Yeah.
Also the Stannard files.

76
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,961
Oh, Garber called last week.

77
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:29,159
We pushed your meeting
up to the 12th.

78
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,060
You'll go to Seattle
right out of D.C.

79
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:35,073
I'll go there tomorrow and
brief them on the new numbers.

80
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,278
You did good.

81
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,044
Syd, you are sensational!

82
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,442
No problem!

83
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,767
You're my kind of guy.

84
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:45,444
And what kind is that?

85
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,040
Temporary.

86
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,011
So, let us move ahead,

87
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:56,129
with energy,
with compassion, and...

88
00:08:56,811 --> 00:09:00,911
...united by the vision
of what New Mexico can be...

89
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:04,005
<i>...if only we dare
to make it so.</i>

90
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:05,984
Darling,

91
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,166
you are so positive.

92
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,649
- No, I'm not.
- Your strength flows right off--

93
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,000
- Oh, no, please--
- I'm not just saying that!

94
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,901
- I was terrible.
- You're so strong...

95
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,509
...in a nice, understated way.
Now, granted,

96
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:21,000
I may be a bit biased, Mr. St. John,
but you have got to admit that...

97
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,195
...Wallace has just got
that certain-- you know.

98
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:27,084
Mrs. Furman, Wallace,
I'll be right down.

99
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,336
Are you sure you want to handle
this campaign?

100
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,836
- Why?
- Why?

101
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:38,056
If this guy were masturbating
his hand would fall asleep.

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
We have nothing to lose.

103
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,557
Anything that gets over 39%
makes us look good.

104
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:45,957
And it pays the overhead.

105
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:52,706
Wallace, you're running
for governor.

106
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,748
It's not gonna be easy.

107
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:58,015
What we're aiming for here,
the ideal,

108
00:09:58,016 --> 00:10:01,281
is that you personify
the themes of the campaign.

109
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:04,482
That you make a statement
just by standing up. Now,

110
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,739
our themes are:

111
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,275
new ideas, new directions.

112
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:12,052
Change! Vigor!

113
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:15,201
No offense, but you look
too soft to change a tire...

114
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:17,502
- ...much less a state.
- That's ridiculous.

115
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:20,196
- What are you saying?
- He's saying you're a wimp.

116
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,712
What I'm saying is,

117
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:24,522
you've got to align
the perception with the reality.

118
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:27,033
<i>We've got two immediate problems.
One, you were born into money.</i>

119
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,164
<i>Two, you did it out of state,
which wasn't too smart,</i>

120
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:32,365
<i>but these are turnable,
we'll manage this whole thing.</i>

121
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,990
All right, I want you to go
on a high protein diet...

122
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:37,504
...and start working out
on a Nautilus,

123
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,401
three times a week,
minimum.

124
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:42,158
We also gotta work on punching up
this delivery of yours.

125
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,150
And energize it, make it track
with the message. Okay?

126
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,351
- Yeah, okay.
- Now let's talk about colors.

127
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:49,282
Syd's gonna take you
to this guy on 57th Street...

128
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,683
...for a couple of dozen shirts,
once we get set on the shades.

129
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:55,142
I don't like you in blue or gray.
Too cold for you.

130
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,608
You're running
in New Mexico.

131
00:10:57,762 --> 00:10:59,502
You look a little
washed out.

132
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,362
Don't you ever
get outside at all?

133
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:03,403
I've asked him
to stay out of the sun...

134
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:06,704
...because his family has
a history of skin cancer.

135
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,029
But you've never had it.

136
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,266
No.

137
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:15,440
Long-term exposure, right?

138
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,920
This is only going to be
for the next six months.

139
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,547
I don't see anything
to worry about.

140
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:24,286
Wait, I-I'm paying you,
you-you work for me--

141
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,563
You're trying
to run my life here!

142
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:29,264
Wallace, Wallace, Wallace...

143
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:33,931
You are paying me
to make you a new life!

144
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,377
Politics! And in order
for me to do that,

145
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:39,124
I gotta be in charge of
all the elements that go into it.

146
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,025
It's the only way I work.

147
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,471
That means, framing
the overall strategy...

148
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,085
...as well as deciding
all the specifics.

149
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,097
The look of the campaign,
the look of the billboards.

150
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,174
Bumper stickers, what colors
they're going to be?

151
00:11:52,255 --> 00:11:55,455
It means the polling, the ads,
radio, TV, newspapers.

152
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,995
It means coordinating every piece
of information out of this office...

153
00:11:58,996 --> 00:12:01,010
...to make sure it fits with
what a polling tells us...

154
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,791
...the people are
worrying about.

155
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:04,326
Or what they're
feeling good about!

156
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:07,495
But, aside from the campaign themes,
I want to address...

157
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:10,040
- ...some of my long-term plans!
- Yes, I'm sure they're great,

158
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,432
but they're not important.

159
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:14,006
See, my job is to get you in.
Once you're there,

160
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:17,447
you do whatever your conscience
tells you to do.

161
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,540
<i>...before the largest crowd
of the campaign.</i>

162
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:54,538
<i>It now appears the bloody
terrorist attack succeeded only...</i>

163
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,002
<i>...in adding momentum
and conferring legitimacy...</i>

164
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:59,539
<i>...on the one-time
underdog Cepeda.</i>

165
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:03,003
Well, Mr. Billings,
this is not good news.

166
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,785
It certainly is not,
Your Excellency.

167
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,958
Do you know
how it happened?

168
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,083
Well, we know that none of
our people were involved.

169
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,219
Perhaps, the guerillas.
I'll know more tonight.

170
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,990
How will the bombing
affect us?

171
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,381
It's hard to know.

172
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,320
Cepeda could gather
tremendous support.

173
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:25,384
The only thing I know for sure...

174
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:29,126
...is that Pete St. John will milk
this thing for all it's worth.

175
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:33,305
- Milk it?
- Exploit. Use.

176
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:36,909
An incident like this
is tailor-made for St. John.

177
00:13:37,893 --> 00:13:39,954
He managed the Cepeda campaign
brilliantly.

178
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:42,555
He'll probably manipulate him
into the presidency.

179
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,400
<i>That is what I fear.</i>

180
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:49,093
We have spent considerable
amounts of money down there.

181
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:52,936
His Majesty will not be pleased,
Mr. Billings.

182
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,078
Nor am I, Excellency.

183
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,501
<i>These have been
difficult years for us.</i>

184
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Prices keep falling.

185
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,091
Populists like Cepeda keep...

186
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:08,816
<i>...nationalizing their oil
and entering the market.</i>

187
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:12,583
Here, we have senators
and congressmen talking of...

188
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:16,086
...solar generation and
electrical wind generators...

189
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:19,393
<i>...and other such--
impractical ideas.</i>

190
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:25,152
Your upcoming elections are
important to us, Mr. Billings.

191
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,478
We're well prepared.

192
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:32,247
I feel completely secure
about Senator Hastings.

193
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:36,134
And the man who will be
replacing him in...

194
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:40,682
- ...Oheeo?
- Ohio.

195
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,430
Thank you, Mr. Billings.

196
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,179
A superb candidate,
Your Excellency.

197
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,254
Who will be in charge
of his campaign?

198
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:52,028
Well, we have one of the
top campaign consultants.

199
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:55,304
Why not... Pete St. John?

200
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:59,042
He may be too close
to Senator Hastings.

201
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,042
He may have
conflicting loyalties.

202
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:05,976
From what I know of St. John,
he has no loyalties.

203
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:09,164
His candidates seem to be on the left,
on the right, in the center--

204
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,975
He seems to be loyal
only to money.

205
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:15,114
And we have money.

206
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:18,043
- I want to think about it.
- Is he the best?

207
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:21,585
- Yes, certainly one of the best.
- Then, please, Billings...

208
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,386
...do think about it.

209
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:26,709
I don't want His Majesty upset
with another failure,

210
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,520
mine...

211
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,402
...or yours.

212
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,109
...We can't afford you
anymore, Pete.

213
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,958
Naah, you don't have to, Senator.
I'm like Mother Teresa.

214
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,366
My work's only
for the truly needy.

215
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,454
I ran into Phil Healston.
He said he saw you...

216
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,201
...at the Aspen conference
last month.

217
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,893
How's Phil doing?

218
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,704
Great, absolutely great.
He said he was very impressed...

219
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:04,142
...with the paper you gave him
on solar generation.

220
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,343
<i>- He showed it to you?
- Mm-hm.</i>

221
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:07,257
What do you think?

222
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:09,368
What else?

223
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,571
<i>If that new design works...</i>

224
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:14,236
...shake-out will be
absolutely incredible.

225
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:16,999
I mean, if this gets funded,

226
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,987
actually worked...

227
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,488
My God!

228
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:23,249
We're talking, ten,
fifteen years?

229
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,449
Just the Sun Belt alone, what,
30%-40% of the population?

230
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,600
That's it for the utilities.
Gone.

231
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:31,203
This is the fuel oil,
electric, gas, everything...

232
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,350
...right down the tubes.

233
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,891
This must've leaked out by now.

234
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:40,072
You and your committee must be
getting squeezed like hell.

235
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,159
God!

236
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,706
When I talked
with Syd,

237
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:52,469
naturally, given
the timing, she, uh,

238
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,525
...she assumed--

239
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:05,371
I'm not running again,
I've made the decision. It's done.

240
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:08,914
I'm not feeling well.
I'm ill.

241
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,003
That's what'll come out.

242
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:14,745
Sam, I didn't know.

243
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,444
It's over, Pete.

244
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:21,090
I'm sorry about the campaign,
but-- it's over.

245
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:23,391
Fuck the campaign.

246
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,347
Just tell me how're you
going to be.

247
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:26,991
I'll be all right.

248
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,301
Is it terminal?

249
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:36,182
No, it's, uh--

250
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,216
After a while, when we have
some time, we'll talk.

251
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,609
<i>I asked you down here, well,
first, to tell you.</i>

252
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:50,006
Then, to ask you to help me
with the statement.

253
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,924
I don't want to get
into specifics, but,

254
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:55,055
it must be unequivocal.

255
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,493
I've thought you'd be
the guy to write it.

256
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,544
When do you want
this thing?

257
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:06,293
I asked my press secretary to...

258
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:10,127
...call a news conference,
10:00 in the morning.

259
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,809
Tomorrow?

260
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:24,000
Sam, you know you can
postpone this a couple of days--

261
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,101
No!

262
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,822
Okay.

263
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:38,794
There's a few calls you're
gonna have to make tonight...

264
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:42,178
...to let people know before
they hear it on the news.

265
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,148
Yes, I forgot.
You're right.

266
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,423
The Majority Leader,

267
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:53,985
the... State Party Chairman...

268
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:09,025
Sam, I'm really sorry.

269
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,836
You're one of the three or four guys
who made a difference up there.

270
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,531
- Yeah.
<i>- Mr. St. John?</i>

271
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,683
Who are you?

272
00:19:58,006 --> 00:20:00,906
Arnold Billings. I'm calling
on behalf of Jerome Cade.

273
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,543
- Never heard of him.
<i>- Yes, I know.</i>

274
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,196
I'd like to arrange
an introduction.

275
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,917
Mr. Cade will be running
for Senator Hastings' seat.

276
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:13,889
- How did you find out?
<i>- We just heard.</i>

277
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,210
He'll be entering
the primary?

278
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,663
Yes, but I expect
he'll be unopposed.

279
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,789
I seriously doubt that,
Mr. Billings.

280
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:26,664
Nonetheless, that's the opinion here.
The filing deadline's the 1st.

281
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,749
We already organized
to collect signatures.

282
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,535
Mr. Cade is well-known
within Ohio and...

283
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:33,236
...the Senate seat is something
he's giving serious thought to.

284
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,960
You know my price?

285
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,106
$25,000 a month plus expenses,

286
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:39,576
15% override on all media buys.

287
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,132
Tell me more
about Mr. Cade.

288
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:50,192
Senator, how are you, sir?

289
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,643
How are you? It's good
to see you again.

290
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:54,505
Madam.

291
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,295
I got one for you.

292
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,691
Why did they put windshield wipers
on a Polish airline...

293
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,483
- ...on the inside?
- Why?

294
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,640
- Hey! How're you doing?
- Wilfred, you old reprobate!

295
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:12,351
I hear you're gonna resign
from the paper and finally...

296
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:15,052
- ...do some good in the world.
- Oh, God.

297
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:17,666
- Good to see you.
<i>- Nice seeing you.</i>

298
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:20,606
- My Goodness.
- Good morning.

299
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,379
I was worried for a while
I was gonna break our string.

300
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,467
Oh, no, I got your message.
You were in London last week.

301
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,039
Yes, Leonard and I were summoned
by our news editor for some...

302
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,721
...in-depth preplanning of our--

303
00:21:32,722 --> 00:21:34,191
let's see, of our--

304
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,314
American election coverage.

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,364
- Wilfred?
- Yes?

306
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:46,119
What have you heard about, um,
about Sam Hastings?

307
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:50,274
Oh! Nothing yet.
He's supposed to be sick.

308
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,581
Hm! No ideas, huh?

309
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,251
Are you writing this down,
Ellen, honey?

310
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:56,852
No, no, no.
I'm just curious.

311
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:59,736
All I know is he--
- Have you decided?

312
00:21:59,797 --> 00:22:01,497
Oh, uh, yes.

313
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:03,911
Have you got any freshly
squeezed orange juice?

314
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,721
- You didn't have any the last time.
- We have.

315
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,989
Right. I'll have
a large glass and...

316
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,420
...and English muffin.

317
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:12,934
I'll have that juice, too,
with a little vodka and ice.

318
00:22:12,935 --> 00:22:15,135
- Anything else, Mr. Buckley?
- A doughnut plain.

319
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:20,014
All I know is, I ran into him
three weeks ago...

320
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:22,791
...at the Gridiron thing,
and everything was great.

321
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,023
He looks great,
like usual.

322
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,998
He feels good, just had
his physical at Walter Reed,

323
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,227
everything checked out
just fine,

324
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,130
and, all of a sudden,

325
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,001
he's walking away from
the U.S. Senate. Mmm?

326
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:36,948
This means that
Mr. St. John loses...

327
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:39,620
...one of his "A" clients.

328
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,244
How's our boy?
Have you seen him lately?

329
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:44,979
I called him,
he's in South America.

330
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,952
He was doing the...

331
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:49,880
...presidential campaign
last week, there.

332
00:22:50,258 --> 00:22:52,058
Are you two getting
back together?

333
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,416
- Are you?
- No.

334
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:57,363
Let's get right to it, shall we?

335
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:00,038
Did he screw you
as good as he did me?

336
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,103
- Have you seen him?
- No.

337
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,110
You're doing the New Mexico
gubernatorial race, uh...

338
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:09,391
- ...Frank McKusker, right?
- Yeah.

339
00:23:09,444 --> 00:23:12,044
You'll be seeing him
very soon.

340
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,092
- He got Wallace Furman.
- Yeah, I heard he signed on.

341
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:18,694
Well, why not? Get the best
money can buy, right?

342
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:21,000
That's what he is, isn't he?
I mean, he's the very best.

343
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:24,682
It doesn't matter what or who
gets hurt in the process.

344
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:28,827
Sometimes I look at him
and he seems the same.

345
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,756
You were married to him,
so tell me,

346
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,257
when did it happen?

347
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,380
<i>I keep thinking back and
I can't figure it out.</i>

348
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:41,697
When did he start thinking
it didn't matter anymore?

349
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,912
I never heard of this guy.
He's got me on the phone...

350
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:48,464
...one hour, 55 minutes
after you'd made the calls.

351
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:52,164
I'm not surprised.
We knew it would get around.

352
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,222
Who is he?

353
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,823
- Billings or Cade?
- Either one.

354
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,984
Well, I've met Billings once.

355
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,951
He's in Washington.

356
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,103
I believe he has a
public relations firm,

357
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,050
I'm not exactly sure.

358
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,150
And Cade, owns
a number of businesses.

359
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:14,256
Trucking, bottling,

360
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:17,906
and something with pipelines,
mostly in the Midwest.

361
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:21,265
He's made some large contributions
to the State party.

362
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,182
He got a lot of
publicity last year.

363
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,243
He headed a
blue-ribbon commission on...

364
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:28,144
...governmental waste.

365
00:24:30,746 --> 00:24:32,260
What do you think?

366
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,046
About what?

367
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,523
Cade.

368
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:42,576
Should I take him on?

369
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:45,001
Well, I'd give it
some serious thought.

370
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:46,702
Is that the new draft?

371
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,000
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

372
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:55,253
Still, you must be happy about
connecting with McKusker.

373
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:58,228
- He's the big favorite, right?
- Oh, I sure am, honey.

374
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:00,429
Gotta look out for
my batting average.

375
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,032
Speak of the devil!
Look at this.

376
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
As I live and breathe.

377
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:07,798
Hello.

378
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,117
Darling.

379
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:12,538
- I'm sorry about Sam.
- Yeah.

380
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,971
How's Claire taking it?

381
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,003
She's doing fine.
So is he.

382
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:20,154
Pete, Pete-- um--

383
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,384
Is it-- Is it cancer?

384
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:25,289
I-I know his physical
last month was good--

385
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:27,374
His press conference
is at 10:00.

386
00:25:27,804 --> 00:25:29,062
What did he say?

387
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:32,004
- "His press conference is at 10:00."
- Oh.

388
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:35,556
Thanks.

389
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:41,538
I hear we'll be running into
each other around New Mexico.

390
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,735
Yeah. How about we keep it
close till the last week?

391
00:25:43,736 --> 00:25:45,436
Then flip a coin.

392
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,539
I saw you on Brinkley.
It's incredible but I think...

393
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,898
...you're more arrogant
since we got divorced.

394
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,138
Hey, look, don't go
blaming yourself.

395
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,106
You're meeting with
Jerome Cade at 10:30.

396
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:02,558
- Tonight?
- Look, his people called!

397
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,439
You're going flat out
the rest of the week and...

398
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,099
...they wanted this meeting
as soon as possible.

399
00:26:10,054 --> 00:26:11,254
Look,

400
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,822
I'll call back
and postpone.

401
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,687
You don't need to take
this guy on.

402
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:18,833
Besides Stannard in Seattle,
we still got Cepeda.

403
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:22,030
And Furman in New Mexico's
gonna take a lot of time.

404
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,630
It's all right.

405
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:40,975
<i>All right, it boils down
to this, Governor.</i>

406
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:44,476
We don't wait for Murdoch
to bust our balls, we jump his.

407
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,349
Now, you've seen how
he's braked out.

408
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,650
You're getting killed on
the death penalty veto.

409
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:53,943
Ever wonder why the Eastwood movies
do so good up here?

410
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,576
And then, there is the--

411
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:58,796
the divorce.

412
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,291
Not so much that you split up,

413
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,523
...but we had been pushing
the family image...

414
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,010
...in the first campaign.

415
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:09,022
<i>I read the report
this morning, Pete.</i>

416
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,791
Not unexpected,

417
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,850
but the fact that the resentment
has lasted this long...

418
00:27:12,851 --> 00:27:14,474
...was surprising.

419
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:17,714
Look, Governor, if you go over
the focus group interview...

420
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:19,990
you'll see they keep
mentioning the fact...

421
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:23,021
...that you married
your campaign manager.

422
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,261
They also keep mentioning
that campfire commercial.

423
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,095
Harry cooking eggs
over the fire...

424
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:34,996
...for the kids, while
you're chopping wood?

425
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,588
That was almost four years ago.
Hell of a spot!

426
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:42,746
The election's this fall.
I gotta teach you how to cook.

427
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:48,163
Governor, this is
my recommendation.

428
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:50,772
We advance the media buys
three weeks,

429
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,815
shift money from the fall schedule
if we have to and blow him away now.

430
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:56,410
Back him off, before he nails you
for mothering killers and...

431
00:27:56,411 --> 00:28:00,311
- ...dumping Harry and the kids.
- She didn't dump them.

432
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:06,022
Yeah, anyway,
that's my recommendation.

433
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,955
We've leased 30 minutes
of satellite time.

434
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,461
They'll be beaming him in
in about 90 seconds.

435
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:24,054
So, let's move our chairs
a little closer.

436
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,050
Charles, go ahead, sit down.
Mrs. Furman.

437
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:30,611
Put the chairs close
so we can talk into the mic.

438
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:32,144
Who is this guy?
Captain Video?

439
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:35,837
No, he's the best numbers-cruncher
in the free world.

440
00:28:37,177 --> 00:28:39,621
I'll be heading back to New York
in about 10 minutes,

441
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,196
but Syd's going to stick around
for a couple of days...

442
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,808
...and make sure
everything's on line.

443
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:45,069
I thought you were going
to be in charge.

444
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:47,645
I am, Mrs. Furman.
I'm in overall charge.

445
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:50,003
Fortunately, Syd has consented
to make sure...

446
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:52,851
...I don't screw up on
any of those details.

447
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:58,093
It'll take a minute.
St. John to Ralph.

448
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,825
St. John to Ralph.

449
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,879
St. John to Ralph.

450
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:06,069
There he is.

451
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,841
<i>- Sorry, Pete.</i>
- It's okay, Ralph.

452
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,993
<i>- Sorry, Pete.</i>
- All right. You're looking good, Ralph.

453
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,410
I try.

454
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:17,532
Ralph, I got
Mr. and Mrs. Furman here,

455
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,002
<i>and Charles Whiting,
their campaign manager.</i>

456
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:21,612
They're excited to hear about
what you can do for them, so,

457
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:23,817
just lay out the program...

458
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,513
...and they'll cut in
if they have any questions.

459
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:28,235
<i>- The sound level's okay?</i>
- Yeah, it's great.

460
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,002
<i>The principle is simple enough.</i>

461
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,988
<i>We take the last census data...</i>

462
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:36,933
<i>...and we match it against
all the New Mexico zip codes.</i>

463
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:39,075
<i>Then we combine that with what
the field research has determined...</i>

464
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,572
<i>...should be the targeted
population clusters.</i>

465
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:45,773
<i>In your case we've isolated
18 neutral or favorable clusters.</i>

466
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>For example, we concluded
a high favorable is, uh...</i>

467
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,120
<i>...pools and patios.</i>

468
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:56,689
<i>Suburban, white-collar,
married, 25 to 49 years old.</i>

469
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,958
<i>We tailor the mail and the
phone pitches to each group...</i>

470
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:02,219
<i>...based on what we already know
is bothering them.</i>

471
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:07,094
<i>But the really exciting stuff comes
when I work out a simulation model.</i>

472
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,467
<i>That's when you tell me
what you're thinking of saying...</i>

473
00:30:09,468 --> 00:30:11,568
<i>...and I'll tell you how
they're going to react.</i>

474
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,752
<i>Even then, the short range
possibilities of a simulation--</i>

475
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:15,221
- Err-- excuse me...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

476
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:17,537
What is a simulation model?

477
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:19,738
<i>It's a little complicated
but I'll try to explain.</i>

478
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,046
See you around the block.
<i>It's based on the idea that...</i>

479
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,603
See you.
<i>...a small number can represent...</i>

480
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,053
<i>...a much larger number.</i>

481
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,359
<i>We start out with
the breakdown of, let's say,</i>

482
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,985
<i>a city like Albuquerque.</i>

483
00:30:29,135 --> 00:30:30,760
<i>We break it down
demographically by...</i>

484
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,135
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right, yeah.

485
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,565
- Bye!
- Goodbye.

486
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,810
Pete!

487
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:55,563
Wallace Furman?

488
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,470
Oh, God!

489
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,660
Wallace Furman?

490
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:07,984
You got a real piece of work
this time, Pete!

491
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:11,464
What's gonna happen to your
boy Furman when you go home...

492
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:14,311
...and he's got to stand all by himself,
and let all the folks in on...

493
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:18,646
...whatever he could possibly have
on his feeble mind? Goddamn!

494
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,545
How could you sell this guy?

495
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:23,525
It's just for governor,
he doesn't have to be perfect.

496
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,133
There's more
than just winning!

497
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:28,474
I told you that the first time
you came in the door!

498
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:30,076
And you used to
believe in that, too!

499
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,001
- You used to believe that--
- I used to believe in tooth fairies, OK?

500
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:36,002
Oh! You wanna talk
about fairies?

501
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:38,524
What about Willet?

502
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:42,242
The man fucks chickens!

503
00:31:43,078 --> 00:31:45,757
Yeah! This guy
goes down to Haiti...

504
00:31:45,758 --> 00:31:49,658
...and he gets his rocks off
drinking blood of fucking chickens!

505
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,829
We had pictures!

506
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,747
We had pictures and
we couldn't even use 'em!

507
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:02,911
You put a pervert in the U.S. Congress
who fucks chickens!

508
00:32:05,565 --> 00:32:09,165
I wouldn't be concerned.
He's probably exaggerating.

509
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,693
<i>Pete, they're backed up
at LaGuardia.</i>

510
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:18,994
<i>We'll be circling for about
ten minutes.</i>

511
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:32,564
Mr. Cade.

512
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,164
Sorry I'm late.

513
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,723
I've been looking forward to
meeting you, Mr. St. John.

514
00:32:38,775 --> 00:32:40,961
I hope you're going into
this thing prepared to be...

515
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:43,862
...the official hydrant
for the State of Ohio?

516
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:47,253
You'll find that I'm prepared
for whatever it takes.

517
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,320
Does that go for the
energy market as well?

518
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:52,969
Ah! I see you've been
making inquiries.

519
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,070
I'd have been concerned
if you hadn't.

520
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:57,201
John, Henry, Mr. St. John.

521
00:32:59,214 --> 00:33:00,714
<i>Can we expedite this?</i>

522
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,048
Is there something
you haven't found out yet,

523
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,611
that you'd like to know?

524
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,254
What's your
biggest weakness?

525
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:15,789
<i>You mean, in running
for the Senate?</i>

526
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:21,767
Probably, the fact that I
haven't held public office yet.

527
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,673
Although I personally
consider that a plus.

528
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,221
It's not critical.

529
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:30,522
You have done some
public service stuff.

530
00:33:30,871 --> 00:33:32,819
Even as far as issues
that could get you...

531
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,998
...into a Kennedy School seminar,
or get your position paper...

532
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:39,014
...printed in the
Times' op-ed page.

533
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:42,000
I take it money
is not a problem.

534
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:43,329
No.

535
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:45,750
So, you would start--

536
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,000
I haven't done any
polls yet, I'd figure...

537
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:52,042
...16, 17, 18 points down.

538
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:55,424
And just by getting the nomination
that would jump.

539
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:58,627
So, I take it you're with me,
then, Mr. St. John?

540
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:03,803
Have you got
a couple of minutes?

541
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:06,204
I'd like to show you something
down in the basement.

542
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,980
Gentlemen, thank you.

543
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:15,573
Mr. Cade.

544
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,873
The Senate put in
new chairs,

545
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:32,267
right before Sam's
last campaign.

546
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:35,468
I talked him into letting me
keep his old one.

547
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,616
We used it in four or five
of his last TV spots.

548
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,989
Sit in it.

549
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:09,461
- How does it feel?
- It feels quite comfortable.

550
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:11,998
And please, don't play
games with me, Mr. St. John.

551
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:15,154
<i>I've known what I wanted
for a very long time.</i>

552
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,532
You want one like that?
It's going to run you...

553
00:35:21,001 --> 00:35:25,001
- ...ten, eleven million bucks.
- An absurd sum, Mr. St. John.

554
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,694
But the real absurdity is to spend
that kind of money and not get it.

555
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:31,314
Now, you tell me,
if I pay you what you want,

556
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:33,958
will you be able to give me
the amount of time I require...

557
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:36,482
...or you'll be spread too thin
among your other candidates?

558
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:39,953
You'll get all the time
you require, Mr. Cade.

559
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:47,535
You do know that
if I take you on,

560
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,601
I'll be in control.

561
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:53,153
Just so we're clear,
that means strategy, budget--

562
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:55,127
The process doesn't interest me,
Mr. St. John.

563
00:35:55,128 --> 00:35:58,370
What does is that you have
an 85% success rate.

564
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,335
I will pay you to play
those percentages.

565
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:05,536
My sole concern is my work
once I'm elected.

566
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:07,965
Why should I take you on?

567
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,902
<i>Because some guy named Arnold
Billings got my phone number...</i>

568
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,141
<i>- ...and got to me first?</i>
- Because once I get in--

569
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:15,320
and I will, with your help
or with someone else's,

570
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:18,055
I can accomplish
what has to be done.

571
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:20,488
Change the policies that
are strangling this country.

572
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,456
Now, I'm ready to begin.

573
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:24,362
Are you with me?

574
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,050
Where is Billings
in all this?

575
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:32,026
Mr. Billings is a business
associate of mine.

576
00:36:32,027 --> 00:36:34,919
He handles public relations work
for some of my companies.

577
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,820
He has no official position
in my campaign.

578
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,172
He told me you were going to
line up with Sam on the issues.

579
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:43,309
- Did he get that right?
- That's correct.

580
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,310
Except for the solar energy bill,
I don't believe that approach is sound.

581
00:36:50,944 --> 00:36:53,207
No, no. You explain it to me.

582
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:55,707
He's with you except
on solar energy.

583
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:58,382
Like being with Gloria Steinem
except on women.

584
00:36:58,708 --> 00:36:59,989
I don't understand, Pete.

585
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:02,306
You were never much interested
on how your clients...

586
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,714
...stood on the issues before.

587
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:07,215
- I am now.
- Why?

588
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:10,474
He'd be replacing you.

589
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,160
What's the big problem?
Take him on.

590
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,359
Leonard...

591
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,176
I want to cancel the
West Coast trip.

592
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:34,993
We can get a stringer from L. A.
if we really need it, can't we?

593
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:36,884
Okay.

594
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:41,328
I want to take a look
into Sam Hastings.

595
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,993
Right, you're friendly with him
and he's wife, right?

596
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:46,817
Have you heard anything?

597
00:37:46,818 --> 00:37:49,697
- Nothing special, no, but I--
- Coordinate it with Manny.

598
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:52,016
He's pulled a couple of people
from metro just to...

599
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:54,077
...chase down the rumors.

600
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:56,034
Have you heard the latest?

601
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:57,935
He's got AIDS.

602
00:37:58,035 --> 00:38:00,337
Jesus, I love Washington!

603
00:38:04,268 --> 00:38:06,468
Thank you for
your note, Ellen.

604
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,993
It meant a great deal to us,
it really did.

605
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,937
I meant everything
I wrote in it.

606
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:13,138
It's a great loss
for the country.

607
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,996
Sam is what the Senate
is all about.

608
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:17,276
Thank you.

609
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,388
Claire!

610
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:26,252
Claire! You're new home
is absolutely beautiful.

611
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:29,193
- You've never been here before?
- No.

612
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:32,544
Oh, I can't believe it.
Oh, I feel terrible!

613
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,045
Claire, it's my fault.

614
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:38,068
It's ridiculous, but,
when you get divorced...

615
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:41,007
...you don't know where you stand
anymore with your old friends.

616
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:45,005
You tend to avoid them in case
you make them feel awkward.

617
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:47,990
You assume they're all
going to take sides.

618
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:49,502
And I assumed--

619
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:52,064
well, Sam and Pete
are so close...

620
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,173
I really appreciate
your decision...

621
00:38:55,174 --> 00:38:58,479
...to keep the details of the
illness a family matter.

622
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:03,263
Well, it was very hard.

623
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:06,688
Yes. Yes, I can imagine.

624
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,001
Is Sam being treated here
or in Ohio?

625
00:39:10,935 --> 00:39:13,835
Well, that hasn't been
determined yet.

626
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,404
And how are the boys
taking it?

627
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,985
Oh, I am so proud of them.

628
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:23,015
They have been so strong,
so good.

629
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:25,809
I wouldn't have gotten through this
without those guys.

630
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,167
And your mother,
how's she doing?

631
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:29,482
Well,

632
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:33,468
this thing's been
very hard on her.

633
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,349
We talk to each other every night
on the phone and I--

634
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,993
- She's in Charleston, hm?
- No, no.

635
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:42,013
She moved back to New Orleans
several years ago.

636
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,214
Oh!

637
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,515
Ralph, I need some help
on this Billings guy.

638
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,897
Why's it this tough?

639
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:50,622
How many top black lobbyists
can there be in Washington?

640
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:52,076
Maybe his client list.

641
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,066
Maybe if you pass by all
the probable data banks?

642
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,420
I'd appreciate it.

643
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:58,019
If they're international
we could try wire transfers.

644
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,649
But don't hold your breath.

645
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,774
Ever since those kids started
breaking into everything,

646
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:04,275
everyone's gotten meshugah
on access codes.

647
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,335
Maybe if you take a run by
all the standard industry stuff.

648
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:11,042
Billings Associates's a privately held
corporation. That won't help.

649
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,043
Billings is the only
listed officer.

650
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,978
You need this by when?

651
00:40:18,107 --> 00:40:20,007
As soon as possible.

652
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:23,032
I'm flying down to South America
in 24 hours.

653
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:24,717
I'm in New Mexico the next
couple of days,

654
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:26,333
Ohio the rest of the week.

655
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:30,564
<i>- I know you're busy as hell--</i>
- Have a safe trip. Go.

656
00:40:30,755 --> 00:40:32,055
Pete!

657
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:34,047
How's the South American guy doing?

658
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,839
He's going to take it.

659
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:27,457
My husband felt
such shame, you see.

660
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:31,506
No one in his family, not one,

661
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:35,254
with all their money,
ever offered to help us out.

662
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:38,383
They just washed their hands,

663
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:41,164
every single one of them.

664
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:44,469
Well, except once...

665
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:48,617
...when Claire was getting ready
to go to college,

666
00:42:48,618 --> 00:42:51,845
I had a call from her grandfather,
that he wanted to know...

667
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:55,046
...if Claire needed any money
for her education.

668
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:58,000
<i>I told him what to do
with his money.</i>

669
00:42:59,227 --> 00:43:02,494
I told him that Claire
was valedictorian...

670
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:04,995
...and we'd get along somehow.

671
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,451
Well, he passed away.

672
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,555
I don't remember,

673
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,486
I guess it was several years later.

674
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,183
I did not go to the funeral.

675
00:43:18,326 --> 00:43:22,126
<i>But I did say a prayer
for his soul.</i>

676
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,030
- You okay?
- Yeah.

677
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:00,099
Go get'em, tiger.

678
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:02,058
Okay, take him back.
- Okay, let's go.

679
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,633
Okay.

680
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,440
It looks good from here.

681
00:44:16,899 --> 00:44:18,189
<i>Yeah, we can see
the whole thing.</i>

682
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,900
You about 50 feet?

683
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:21,537
<i>A little less.</i>

684
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,980
Stand by.
Eddie, can you read me?

685
00:44:24,023 --> 00:44:25,323
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

686
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,180
You got them lined up yet?

687
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:29,999
<i>Yeah, we finally got'em
but you better hurry up.</i>

688
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:34,105
Okay, I wanna stay clear
on channel 1.

689
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:37,269
And I want to hear if there's
any troubles, right now!

690
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:39,894
Martha, I want to get
a rough time on this,

691
00:44:39,895 --> 00:44:42,300
so, start reading as soon as
the wagons go, okay?

692
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,060
Okay... roll tape!

693
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,035
Let me know when you got speed.

694
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:50,762
<i>Speed!</i>

695
00:44:50,936 --> 00:44:52,436
<i>Background action!</i>

696
00:44:52,682 --> 00:44:53,982
Cue Wallace!

697
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:57,353
<i>New Mexico is a special land,
blessed with mountains, deserts,</i>

698
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:59,945
<i>clean air and pure waters.</i>

699
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:01,702
<i>But besides her natural resources,</i>

700
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,320
<i>our state has been blessed
with its human resources,</i>

701
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:08,205
<i>from the proud Apache and Navajo tribes
who first hunted and planted here,</i>

702
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:11,128
<i>to our long history of people
who have journeyed here.</i>

703
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:14,026
Whether they came from Mexico,
or Europe or Asia...

704
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:15,527
...or other parts
of this country,

705
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:17,464
<i>they all shared
a common dream:</i>

706
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:19,884
<i>to live in a land where
their opportunities were limited...</i>

707
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,685
...only by their own vision...

708
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:23,921
<i>and to make this special place
even better...</i>

709
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,322
...for their own children
and other generations.

710
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:29,096
We are surely blessed
by that heritage.

712
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:40,245
<i>Wallace Furman,
a governor we can trust.</i>

713
00:45:52,389 --> 00:45:54,389
Back to one.

714
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,080
Back to number one.
Take it back.

715
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:59,045
Eddie, take them back
to number one.

716
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:01,172
Back to number one,
line it all up again!

717
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:04,115
It'll be close to an hour, Pete.

718
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:05,989
We're not gonna have
enough light left.

719
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,200
- 50,000! We'll come back tomorrow!
- Weather prediction's bad for tomorrow!

720
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:11,064
<i>Hold it a second, everybody.</i>

721
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:13,458
<i>You want us back
at number one, Pete?</i>

722
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:15,614
Wait.

723
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:18,539
Wait a minute.

724
00:46:19,322 --> 00:46:21,422
<i>Move it, move it!
Back it up.</i>

725
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:25,345
<i>Back! Move on back!
Do you hear me?</i>

726
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:29,545
Tommy, roll it up to
where the schmuck fell off.

727
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,366
<i>Okay, take it back.</i>

728
00:46:37,236 --> 00:46:39,236
<i>Back, back, back,
back, back...</i>

729
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,671
<i>Back... back...
OK, now forward.</i>

730
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,685
<i>Slowly, very slow...</i>

731
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:47,496
<i>Slow, slow...</i>

732
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,049

734
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:51,940
...freeze!

735
00:46:54,328 --> 00:46:57,128
Okay, mark it.
Take it back to the top.

736
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,320
Okay, forward. Real time.

737
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:14,152

Tomorrow morning I want to go
with TV news coverage.

756
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:17,377
But, every time we hit
a new medium market,

757
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:20,743
we'll have live remotes set up
for the noon or 6:00.

758
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,191
Local anchors don't know shit--

759
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,013
even less than reporters.
This way we'll be able to give...

760
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:25,714
- ...our message straight--
- Hold it, hold it.

761
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:28,023
<i>On the state level, a new entry

people of Ohio,</i>

772
00:49:05,288 --> 00:49:08,788
<i>was particularly disappointed
by Mr. Cade's decision...</i>

773
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:13,672
<i>...not to follow the example
set by Senator Hastings...</i>

774
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:16,541
<i>...in the national leadership
of the development of...</i>

775
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:20,819
<i>...renewable non-polluting energy
offered by solar generation.</i>

776
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,001
<i>I intend to use this campaign
as a sounding board...</i>

777
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:30,257
<i>...to educate the people of Ohio...</i>

778
00:49:30,966 --> 00:49:35,066
<i>...and, more importantly,
the politicians of Ohio,</i>

779
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:39,852
<i>as to certain facts having to do
with our environment.</i>

780
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:45,452
<i>Pardon me.</i>

781
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:48,982
<i>We can... no longer--</i>

782
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,927
What the hell does that mean?

783
00:49:57,844 --> 00:49:59,344
Nothing. Not a damn thing.

784
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:02,164
<i>He'll make a little noise,
feel real good, and he'll get his...</i>

785
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,026
...4% from the veggies
and save-the-whalers.

786
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:07,655
He's not going to hurt us.
They'll hate your guts anyway.

787
00:50:07,656 --> 00:50:10,156
But-- there is something.

788
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,700
Our first poll's showing
a problem with...

789
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,163
<i>...college-educated women
21 to 35.</i>

790
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,690
<i>There's something about you
they don't trust.</i>

791
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:27,999
- How are you today, Mr. Billings?
- Just fine, thank you.

792
00:50:51,469 --> 00:50:53,469
<i>Are you expecting a print-out
from Ralph?</i>

793
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:54,992
<i>Yeah, I sure am.</i>

794
00:51:12,132 --> 00:51:14,532
It must've gotten caught
in the printer.

795
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,995
<i>Have Ralph send me
another one.</i>

796
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:54,005
Governor?

797
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:55,693
Hello, Pete.

798
00:51:55,788 --> 00:51:57,688
I think we gotta talk about
the death penalty thing.

799
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,795
Absolutely not.
That is not negotiable.

800
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,401
I'm not talking about
backing down.

801
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:04,413
But tell me this:
where does it say...

802
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:06,076
...just because you gotta follow
your conscience...

803
00:52:06,077 --> 00:52:07,998
...we gotta stand still
and get kicked?

804
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,761
Any thoughts on the subject?

805
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:11,905
Yes, I do. One.
Frank Coleco.

806
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:14,560
For Christ sakes.
The man is a Neanderthal!

807
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:16,561
So what?
He's our Neanderthal, isn't he?

808
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:20,004
He happens to be speaking for
a constituency we could use.

809
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:23,131
- Or you wanna argue about that?
<i>- You ever actually heard him?</i>

810
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:25,132
In the State House, on the floor,

811
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,082
he said he'd pull the switch and then
drive home and eat a pizza.

812
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,183
<i>This is very, very simple.</i>

813
00:52:30,472 --> 00:52:33,682
He crosses the line, endorses
the opposition, we start to bleed.

814
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:34,817
Come on, Pete!

815
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,818
You got any guarantees he won't?

816
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,280
I put out a wire.
What do I hear?

817
00:52:40,937 --> 00:52:44,329
It turns out the Senator's
next greatest passion,

818
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,030
next to frying convicts,
is high school football,

819
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:49,509
specifically, Eagle Lake High,

820
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,010
<i>where Frank Jr. happens to be
starting left tackle.</i>

821
00:52:52,654 --> 00:52:54,701
He's so proud of the kid
he goes out and buys him...

822
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:57,980
...a brand-new Dodge pick-up.
Then, to make it really special,

823
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:01,205
he calls the Governor's assistant...

824
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,720
...for a little help
in getting plate number. 76,

825
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:05,027
Frank Jr.'s football number.

826
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:07,998
- You're way out of line, pal.
<i>- Coleco calls once.</i>

827
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:10,129
He can't get through.
He leaves a message.

828
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,765
He calls back again. The Governor's
assistant is still in conference.

829
00:53:13,766 --> 00:53:17,163
His secretary calls back
two days later...

830
00:53:17,164 --> 00:53:21,092
...and says his request for
plate 76 will be considered!

831
00:53:21,093 --> 00:53:22,593
What is the thought there?

832
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:25,359
You're turning a philosophical
disagreement into a vendetta?

833
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,825
Our office has never delivered--

834
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:29,826
Just get him the goddamn plate,
all right?!

835
00:53:57,262 --> 00:54:00,062
<i>Well, as you know, I've lived
in this state all my life.</i>

836
00:54:00,189 --> 00:54:01,989
<i>And I've got
a lot of confidence...</i>

837
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,577
...in the plain horse sense
of the voters of New Mexico.

838
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,001
That they'll be able to see
the real issues of this campaign,

839
00:54:08,002 --> 00:54:11,602
who has the experience and
the proven ability to lead...

840
00:54:11,923 --> 00:54:14,623
...and that we simply
cannot afford...

841
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:18,471
...a governor who needs
on-the-job training.

842
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:20,998
Thank you very much, ladies and
gentlemen. Pardon me.

843
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:24,262
Hi there!
Thanks, people. Thanks.

844
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,410
Right! Hey, you're looking good
over there!

845
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:27,861
That's good, Frank.

846
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:29,652
- Real good, Frank.
- I'm worried, Will.

847
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,780
Oh, there's nothing to worry about.

848
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:34,539
- He's starting to move.
- Well, of course he is.

849
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,312
He started so far down
he got no place to go but up.

850
00:54:37,313 --> 00:54:39,913
But still, he's coming up
in the poll.

851
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:44,226
Look, if can't beat some geek,
maybe we don't deserve to win.

852
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:45,357
You're going to ice him, Frank.

853
00:54:45,507 --> 00:54:47,127
Hi, there! How are you?

854
00:54:47,516 --> 00:54:49,316
- You want him to hold?
<i>Excuse me...</i>

855
00:54:49,408 --> 00:54:50,995
- One minute.
<i>What do you think of someone...</i>

856
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,606
<i>...coming from New Mexico
to be governor of New York?</i>

857
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:56,989
<i>What? Is this a joke?
You're not serious, are you?</i>

858
00:54:57,217 --> 00:54:59,414
<i>And what about you, ma'am?
What do you think of someone...</i>

859
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,008
<i>...coming from New Mexico
to be governor of New York?</i>

860
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:04,109
<i>Utterly preposterous, young man.</i>

861
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,218
<i>Not worthy of discussion.</i>

862
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,007
<i>From New Mexico?</i>

863
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:10,648
<i>Is this some kind of
affirmative action thing?</i>

864
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,260
<i>A cow-boy, governor of New York?</i>

865
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:15,845
<i>What do I think of a cow-boy
governor of New York?</i>

866
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,250
<i>C'mon, will you? Gee...</i>

867
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,930
<i>Crazy. Stupid!</i>

868
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,139
Wilfred, you are great.
<i>McKusker...</i>

869
00:55:24,212 --> 00:55:26,412
<i>...from New Mexico
for New Mexico.</i>

870
00:55:27,008 --> 00:55:29,708
You didn't have a date or anything
tonight, did you?

871
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:32,309
Not anymore.

872
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:37,158
Oh, wow.

873
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:42,207
Wallace! How're you doing?

874
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:47,176
Yeah, yeah. I just saw it.
It was terrific, huh?

875
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,578
Yeah, Wallace...

876
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:53,446
Wallace-- look--
Stop worrying, Wallace.

877
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,351
We'll be making a rebuttal
commercial tonight.

878
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:06,311
Yeah, say it again.

879
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,245
Listen, can I call you
right back?

880
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,940
Yeah, right. Thanks.

881
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,295
Helen?

882
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,599
I want you to call Jack Rosack.

883
00:57:13,205 --> 00:57:17,029
I want him to do a sweep of the
offices, studios, everything.

884
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,030
- Right away?
- Right away.

885
00:57:19,178 --> 00:57:22,978
- I want him to do the apartment, too.
- The apartment-- okay, all right.

886
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:29,329
<i>...Wallace Furman can give
our state.</i>

887
00:57:30,128 --> 00:57:32,193
<i>He didn't HAVE to come here.</i>

888
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:34,188
<i>He WANTED to.</i>

889
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:36,089
<i>Wallace Furman for governor.</i>

890
00:57:36,141 --> 00:57:38,741
<i>A new vision for New Mexico.</i>

891
00:57:40,128 --> 00:57:43,228
<i>- Is that a buy, Pete?</i>
- That's it.

892
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:46,633
<i>- I can go home now?</i>
- Let's go home!

893
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:54,832
<i>This is the upper East side
of New York.</i>

894
00:57:55,522 --> 00:57:57,922
<i>This is Monte Carlo.</i>

895
00:57:58,052 --> 00:58:00,952
<i>This is Beverly Hills,
California.</i>

896
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:04,867
<i>Wallace Furman could have lived
in any of these places.</i>

897
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:08,168
<i>Instead, he chose to live
in New Mexico.</i>

898
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:12,678
<i>Not because it was
more exciting or luxurious,</i>

899
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:15,498
<i>but because,
unlike Monte Carlo...</i>

900
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:17,279
<i>...or Beverly Hills,</i>

901
00:58:17,344 --> 00:58:19,644
<i>it was a place that needed help,</i>

902
00:58:20,002 --> 00:58:22,497
<i>needed the energy
and the new leadership...</i>

903
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:25,298
<i>...that Wallace Furman
can give our state.</i>

904
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:27,504
<i>He didn't HAVE to come here.</i>

905
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,469
<i>He WANTED to.</i>

906
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,552
<i>Wallace Furman for governor.</i>

00:58:31,602 --> 00:58:34,102
<i>A new vision for New Mexico.</i>

908
00:58:43,462 --> 00:58:45,462
What about the photo session?

909
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,529
Syd! Syd!

910
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,610
I've got Pete on the line.

911
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,974
The newspaper you wanted me
to research?

912
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:10,741
We just got the overnights,
we stopped the erosion.

913
00:59:10,742 --> 00:59:13,342
That carpetbagger thing
is a dead issue.

914
00:59:13,499 --> 00:59:16,979
I know you don't need to hear this,
but that mansion spot was brilliant.

915
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:19,688
Yeah, that was great.
Look, I'm going to be here one...

916
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,889
...maybe two more days,
and then back to New York.

917
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:23,391
I want to go over this stuff
that Mitch sent,

918
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:25,992
then we have to talk about
the rehearsal for the debate.

919
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:30,165
<i>Oh, almost forgot
the best part. Listen.</i>

920
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,333
The story going around
down there is that...

921
00:59:33,538 --> 00:59:36,038
...McKusker got the new numbers...

922
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,281
...and he panicked.

923
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:42,016
I have it from two sources
that he fired Wilfred Buckley...

924
00:59:42,117 --> 00:59:44,317
<i>...and he hired John Dietrich.</i>

925
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:49,157
Isn't that incredible?

926
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,797
Jerome.

927
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,109
Yeah, Billings?

928
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,830
- He's doing everything he should?
- Mm-hmm.

929
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:15,109
- The quality is...?
- Well, you've seen it.

930
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,310
The polling, the ads.
First rate.

931
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,663
I don't know...

932
01:00:26,464 --> 01:00:28,464
<i>Baggage will arrive
at the low level.</i>

933
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:32,374
<i>Buses for downtown Cleveland
are available outside main hall.</i>

934
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,574
Thanks for meeting me, Pete.

935
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:37,124
I thought you'd get out
of all the traveling this year.

936
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,925
So did I!

937
01:00:39,507 --> 01:00:42,907
- Spoken to Sam recently?
- Last week.

938
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,121
Talked about his illness?

939
01:00:46,005 --> 01:00:47,705
Off the record.

940
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:49,984
Not much.

941
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:52,090
Mostly about whether or not
he's going to stay in Washington...

942
01:00:52,091 --> 01:00:54,005
...and practice law...

943
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:56,006
...or go back to Ohio.

944
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,719
I don't think he's ill.

945
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:00,812
Is that so?

946
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,069
I'm curious,

947
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:08,479
how much do you actually know
about Sam? Financially, I mean.

948
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:12,112
He's never had that much.
It's just his salary.

949
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:14,239
And Claire?

950
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:16,607
Her family's got dough.

951
01:01:17,153 --> 01:01:18,846
Yes, but she never
got any, did she?

952
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:20,347
Her father blew his share.

953
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:22,133
Did you know
she needed scholarships...

954
01:01:22,134 --> 01:01:24,534
- ...to get through college?
- You've been busy.

955
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,099
Pete...

956
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:34,907
How many times have you been
to their house?

957
01:01:35,052 --> 01:01:38,352
Have you ever wondered
how they carried that place?

958
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:43,150
Look, that house's gotta be worth
at least $600,000.

959
01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:45,751
The mortgage is under $200,000.

960
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,336
I know they didn't get
anything like that...

961
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:50,837
...when they sold the other house
in Virginia.

962
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,690
Have you ever noticed
the furniture? The antiques?

963
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:59,520
- Claire paid for those, all in cash.
- What are you trying to tell me?

964
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:01,421
That Sam's on the take?
Is that it?

965
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,018
Is that the line that'd let you
win the Snoop-Of-The-Year award?

966
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:06,813
Cause if it is, you've got
this one little problem.

967
01:02:06,814 --> 01:02:09,114
Why's he taking a walk?

968
01:02:09,306 --> 01:02:10,991
I don't have the story yet.

969
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:13,106
I don't know why he's leaving.

970
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:16,915
Pete, Sam is your friend.

971
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:19,329
If you're--
Any bad judgment--

972
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:22,631
You're talking to me, remember?

973
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:24,477
You're praying so hard
he's fucked up,

974
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:27,174
you're salivating.
You're f--

975
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:32,052
You're fucked up. Not him.

976
01:02:33,995 --> 01:02:35,995
You're a fuck-up.

977
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:51,341
Look, there's a lot of stuff
flying around Washington...

978
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,470
...about why you're leaving.

979
01:02:53,727 --> 01:02:55,622
About how you can afford
all those antiques,

980
01:02:55,623 --> 01:02:57,823
about buying the new house.

981
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,400
As a friend...

982
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:05,488
...I appreciate you
telling me that, Pete.

983
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,762
I love my job.

984
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:12,890
A man couldn't ask
for a better one.

985
01:03:14,144 --> 01:03:17,097
But it's precisely because of
crap like that...

986
01:03:17,098 --> 01:03:19,198
...I'm glad I'm getting out.

987
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,080
Those things are Claire's.
She collects them.

988
01:03:23,598 --> 01:03:25,998
The money's from her inheritance.

989
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,056
Here you are, Mr. St. John.

990
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,810
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

991
01:05:44,298 --> 01:05:45,982
You were right.
I shouldn't have done that.

992
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,783
It was stupid.

993
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:51,459
I just wanted you to know
that I... recognize that.

994
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:53,089
So...

995
01:05:54,275 --> 01:05:56,475
Maybe, buy you a drink?

996
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,000
How'd you know
I'd be here tonight?

997
01:06:11,811 --> 01:06:14,084
Well, the receptionist said
you hadn't checked out,

998
01:06:14,085 --> 01:06:17,885
and your office in New York said
you weren't due until tomorrow and...

999
01:06:25,897 --> 01:06:27,597
I saw Sam.

1000
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,469
Oh.

1001
01:06:32,136 --> 01:06:33,974
You knew I would. That's why
you've been camping...

1002
01:06:33,975 --> 01:06:35,961
...out here all night.

1003
01:06:35,962 --> 01:06:39,562
It's all right, it's okay.
You're good. You're real good.

1004
01:06:40,148 --> 01:06:42,548
I mean, on that
we've always agreed.

1005
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:52,777
I'm going to tell you
what Sam said.

1006
01:06:57,948 --> 01:07:01,148
He said the money came
from her inheritance.

1007
01:07:11,463 --> 01:07:13,363
Christ, he lied to me.

1008
01:07:16,013 --> 01:07:18,104
For a politician, you'd think
he'd be pretty good.

1009
01:07:18,105 --> 01:07:20,305
He was so fucking bad.

1010
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:26,376
You've been lied to before.

1011
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:31,716
Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.

1012
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:35,014
Are you going to hold that
over me forever?

1013
01:07:35,114 --> 01:07:38,514
Good old Saint Pete, who never
told a lie to his wife.

1014
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:40,524
You never asked.

1015
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:42,288
Well, I'm asking now!

1016
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:44,697
How many?

1017
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:47,783
Times or women?

1018
01:07:47,908 --> 01:07:50,308
Oh, let's keep this
to one night. Women.

1019
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:05,764
All right, let's set
the history straight here.

1020
01:08:08,609 --> 01:08:11,809
Towards the end, you and I were close
if we were in the same time zone.

1021
01:08:18,364 --> 01:08:19,964
You got any idea
what it's like...

1022
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,345
...to spend ten days
massaging some poll?

1023
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:26,074
And wind up at 1:00 a.m.
in some bar in Cleveland...

1024
01:08:27,498 --> 01:08:30,198
...and notice some lady
across the room...

1025
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:32,509
...with a lot of hair
on her chin?

1026
01:08:33,998 --> 01:08:36,198
Yes, I have an idea.

1027
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:39,319
It must be like chasing a story
for a week and a half,

1028
01:08:39,391 --> 01:08:40,991
getting nothing but
doors slammed in your face...

1029
01:08:41,302 --> 01:08:45,167
...and ending up in some bar
in the Ramada Inn in Akron,

1030
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:47,380
next to a guy with a clean shirt,

1031
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:50,168
whose hands don't sweat?

1032
01:08:54,188 --> 01:08:55,788
No.

1033
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,430
Nothing like that at all.

1034
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:25,074
Well, they're now
in his room, fucking.

1035
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,817
So what? They used to be married.

1036
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:31,545
Look, what has he actually done?

1037
01:09:32,023 --> 01:09:35,023
He went to see Hastings.
He's the best friend he's got.

1038
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,001
We know he run a check on me.

1039
01:09:37,002 --> 01:09:39,229
You put him in touch with me,
so, he run a check on you.

1040
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,660
Now, he's screwing
his ex-wife.

1041
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,755
Uh, she's a problem.
I don't care how you cut it.

1042
01:09:42,756 --> 01:09:45,527
Trip to New Orleans,
a session with Hastings wife--

1043
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:47,156
I can't help but
find that troubling.

1044
01:09:47,218 --> 01:09:49,918
All right, Billings, what are you
going to do about it?

1045
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:05,995
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Breakfast, sir.

1046
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,702
<i>Okay</i>

1047
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,245
- Didn't you order Canadian bacon?
<i>- Uh-huh</i>

1048
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:30,041
Didn't bring it.

1049
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,407
<i>...it comes!</i>

1050
01:10:45,509 --> 01:10:49,109
<i>Television's most exciting hour
of fantastic prizes!</i>

1051
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:53,097
<i>The fabulous 60-minute
"Price is Right"!</i>

1052
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:56,746
<i>Tammy Garland!</i>

1053
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,399
<i>Come on down!</i>

1054
01:11:04,161 --> 01:11:07,161
<i>Wally...!</i>
There's a tap on the phone.

1055
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,740
My office phone too.
I found a bug.

1056
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,625
Who?

1057
01:11:13,182 --> 01:11:15,182
I'm not sure.

1058
01:11:17,654 --> 01:11:19,454
I don't know.

1059
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:22,874
Arnold Billings.

1060
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:25,187
Ever heard of him?

1061
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:29,004
He works out of Washington,
does some kind of corporate PR.

1062
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:30,889
But, why?

1063
01:11:33,997 --> 01:11:35,997
I checked him out.

1064
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,729
This is connected with Sam?

1065
01:11:42,607 --> 01:11:44,107
Sam says no.

1066
01:11:58,995 --> 01:12:01,395
Andrea's on the line.
Today's poll is worse.

1067
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:05,602
The shift is starting to build.
The feedback says...

1068
01:12:05,603 --> 01:12:08,203
...it's coming from those
family image spots.

1069
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:10,194
A man called just before
it's out of control.

1070
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:12,834
He says the last couple of days
have been total saturation...

1071
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:14,235
Hey, Mom.

1072
01:12:16,577 --> 01:12:18,577
Okay, get the voice.

1073
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:21,977
Check the room 44, I think
he's doing a new Pepsi spot.

1074
01:12:21,978 --> 01:12:24,378
Tell him to be
at the studio at 11:00.

1075
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:27,501
And I want you to go
to the archives.

1076
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:31,159
Jan shot some cover footage
some time last year.

1077
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:35,085
Somewhere in the middle of that
there's about 10 seconds...

1078
01:12:35,886 --> 01:12:37,915
...of some kid that looks like
Ricky Schroeder that...

1079
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:40,116
...runs up to her and hugs her.

1080
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:43,736
If you have some trouble
finding that, ask Phil.

1081
01:12:43,737 --> 01:12:45,737
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1082
01:12:57,565 --> 01:12:58,658
Governor!

1083
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:01,120
Word here is you've missed the cut
for Mother Of The Year.

1084
01:13:01,121 --> 01:13:02,921
<i>Have you seen
this latest commercial?</i>

1085
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:05,010
Not "The-Sanctity-Of-The-Family" one.

1086
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:06,611
This one is grotesque.

1087
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:09,676
They have these kids--
who aren't that cute,

1088
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,677
all lined up begging for
a governor they can look up to.

1089
01:13:13,493 --> 01:13:15,093
You know, Andrea,

1090
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,910
you and I have this, uh...

1091
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:19,100
...this fantastic symbiosis.

1092
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Even more than with your husband.

1093
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,001
You want to stay in office,
I want to stay in business.

1094
01:13:25,316 --> 01:13:27,316
<i>I think I'll be able
to take care of it.</i>

1095
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:30,359
I want to destroy him now.
I swear I do.

1096
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:41,166
<i>Throughout her public life,</i>

1097
01:13:41,288 --> 01:13:43,288
<i>Andrea Stannard has shown
the courage...</i>

1098
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,220
<i>...to fight for
what she believes in,</i>

1099
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:46,997
<i>and the compassion
to defend those...</i>

1100
01:13:46,998 --> 01:13:48,994
<i>...who can't fight
for themselves.</i>

1101
01:13:48,995 --> 01:13:51,454
<i>But lately,
Albert Murdoch has chosen...</i>

1102
01:13:51,455 --> 01:13:53,595
<i>...not to attack her beliefs.</i>

1103
01:13:53,682 --> 01:13:56,782
<i>Instead, he has smeared
her personal life.</i>

1104
01:13:56,886 --> 01:13:58,541
<i>Smeared her family.</i>

1105
01:13:58,691 --> 01:14:01,186
<i>Smeared her name
and reputation.</i>

1106
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:02,956
<i>Albert Murdoch thinks
that's the way...</i>

1107
01:14:02,957 --> 01:14:05,009
<i>...you get elected
Governor of Washington.</i>

1108
01:14:05,134 --> 01:14:06,534
<i>Do you?</i>

1109
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:09,791
<i>Andrea Stannard.
Courage, compassion.</i>

1110
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,891
<i>Now, more than ever.</i>

1111
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,200
Okay, take it back
to the top.

1112
01:14:17,725 --> 01:14:20,025
Let's animate it this time
with the paint box.

1113
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:23,131
<i>We're ready, Pete.
You want the A. D. O.?</i>

1114
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,740
Yeah, everything this time.
Jackson, you too.

1115
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:27,205
Right, Pete.

1116
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:30,821
Okay. Hit the tape.

1117
01:14:31,338 --> 01:14:34,238
<i>Throughout her public life,

<i>Do you?</i>

1129
01:14:59,002 --> 01:15:02,444
<i>Andrea Stannard.
Courage, compassion.</i>

1130
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:04,161
<i>Now, more than ever.</i>

1131
01:15:04,285 --> 01:15:05,585
All right!

1132
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,701
Right! Yeah!

1133
01:15:13,745 --> 01:15:15,345
How did I do?

1134
01:15:15,673 --> 01:15:19,073
You got me so worked up,
I nearly went up and register.

1135
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,840
You want me
Tuesday afternoon?

1136
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:24,523
Yeah, for the two
new Cade spots.

1137
01:15:24,662 --> 01:15:26,162
- Good night, people.
- Good night.

1138
01:15:26,223 --> 01:15:27,623
Thanks.

1139
01:15:32,857 --> 01:15:36,157
Monday, Rosten's office called.

1140
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:40,763
They said he's reconsidering
running for mayor next year.

1141
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:43,239
He might take a shot
at the Senate.

1142
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,367
They want to cancel
his contract.

1143
01:15:48,187 --> 01:15:50,987
They even want
their retainer back.

1144
01:15:54,177 --> 01:15:57,577
They say anything about us
doing the Senate campaign?

1145
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:02,193
- That's all they said?
- Yeah.

1146
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:04,234
Wednesday, Gazziano called.

1147
01:16:04,354 --> 01:16:08,004
Pretty much the same thing.
They said he's reassessing...

1148
01:16:08,005 --> 01:16:10,514
...his campaign plans
for next year.

1149
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:12,719
He's out.

1150
01:16:17,628 --> 01:16:18,928
Hmm.

1151
01:16:22,561 --> 01:16:25,861
<i>Santa Fe Ground,
Westwind-407-Whiskey to parking.</i>

1152
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,630
<i>Santa Fe Ground to Westwind-407.
Roger.</i>

1153
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,544
<i>Forget about the debate rules
you learned in school.</i>

1154
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,545
Gary, just keep it rolling.

1155
01:16:35,781 --> 01:16:38,681
You can turn any question
into what you want to say.

1156
01:16:38,812 --> 01:16:40,989
If the questions hit
our key points, great.

1157
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,985
If they don't, just slide off.

1158
01:16:44,046 --> 01:16:46,846
<i>Keep pounding away on
our themes, which are:</i>

1159
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,998
Integrity, new ideas,

1160
01:16:48,999 --> 01:16:51,031
no IOU's, no special interests.

1161
01:16:51,032 --> 01:16:52,183
- All right?
- Right.

1162
01:16:52,284 --> 01:16:54,084
Okay, bring it down a little.

1163
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:57,006
Now, you're going to find
yourself very nervous.

1164
01:16:57,016 --> 01:16:59,108
<i>That's to be expected,
it's okay.</i>

1165
01:16:59,109 --> 01:17:01,991
<i>Don't forget McKusker
is going to be nervous, too.</i>

1166
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,877
<i>If your hands
start to shake,</i>

1167
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:06,878
<i>just rest them
on the podium, that's all.</i>

1168
01:17:08,445 --> 01:17:11,192
Now, when he hits you
with the rich boy shot,

1169
01:17:11,191 --> 01:17:12,928
and you make your response,

1170
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:14,617
don't look at him.
Forget him.

1171
01:17:14,618 --> 01:17:16,718
Just look straight ahead
into the camera.

1172
01:17:16,805 --> 01:17:18,319
Listen, what about the road tax?

1173
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,951
If we come out with a
limited increase,

1174
01:17:19,952 --> 01:17:22,282
- tied to the road tax, we can--
<i>- No, no,no!</i>

1175
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,805
You want to win the uncommitteds?
You've got to stay uncommitted.

1176
01:17:25,984 --> 01:17:27,484
Right there, okay, perfect.

1177
01:17:27,587 --> 01:17:29,826
Now, tomorrow night--
this is very important,

1178
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:32,068
when you and McKusker come out,

1179
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:34,677
if that key light isn't high
hitting you dead on...

1180
01:17:34,678 --> 01:17:35,998
...you just walk off.

1181
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:37,480
Don't come back till
they fix it, OK?

1182
01:17:37,481 --> 01:17:39,151
- Right.
- All right.

1183
01:17:40,558 --> 01:17:43,658
Okay, let me see
the opening statement again.

1184
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:48,429
No, nothing, Ellen.

1185
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:51,736
No, I just want to know
if you found anything out yet.

1186
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,775
Yeah.

1187
01:17:59,837 --> 01:18:01,537
Syd, come on.

1188
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:13,304
Jack?

1189
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:16,000
Pete, you're going to have to
fly back to New York commercial.

1190
01:18:16,001 --> 01:18:19,511
- I've already booked you.
- All right, what's the matter?

1191
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:22,094
I got back from dinner
and the airplane was gone.

1192
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,269
The guys in the hangar said
a truck hooked it up and towed it.

1193
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:27,296
They thought I knew about it.

1194
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:31,206
We found it way the hell and back
by the old runway.

1195
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,915
Whoever it was,
went through it,

1196
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,116
but I can't find
anything gone.

1197
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:39,061
I've got to hold it here and
have it checked out tomorrow.

1198
01:18:39,062 --> 01:18:42,062
Do you have any idea
what the hell is going on here?

1199
01:18:44,749 --> 01:18:46,349
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

1200
01:18:46,484 --> 01:18:47,984
<i>Mr. Buckley.</i>

1201
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:51,339
Send him in, Helen.

1202
01:18:58,987 --> 01:19:00,987
Ohhh, my!

1203
01:19:01,965 --> 01:19:04,165
I thought you never
came around these parts.

1204
01:19:05,963 --> 01:19:07,763
Yeah... Oh!

1205
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:10,049
I read someplace, uh--
Reader's Digest,

1206
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,705
that life is dynamic
and you got to--

1207
01:19:11,704 --> 01:19:14,604
keep trying new things--
you got to-- I...

1208
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:19,184
I couldn't believe it when I heard
about the McKusker thing.

1209
01:19:20,086 --> 01:19:22,686
It wouldn't be the first time
I had a butt-head firing me.

1210
01:19:24,216 --> 01:19:26,016
- What's that-- over there...?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1211
01:19:26,155 --> 01:19:27,655
Oh, thank you!

1212
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:30,161
Ah, it was a good lesson.
We'd lost focus.

1213
01:19:30,623 --> 01:19:32,323
He's crapping in his pants
all the time about...

1214
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,458
...what you're going to do next.

1215
01:19:34,776 --> 01:19:36,576
I just let it get away from me.

1216
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,939
What's this--? Ooh!

1217
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:42,141
Yeah, I lost control
of the terrain.

1218
01:19:42,231 --> 01:19:45,731
Started reacting, and sure as shit,
start losing the battle.

1219
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:48,844
What now?

1220
01:19:49,207 --> 01:19:51,707
I'm going to be in Ohio.

1221
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,955
- Ohio?
- Mm-hmm.

1222
01:19:54,145 --> 01:19:58,408
- Westbrook-- You with Westbrook?
- No, with college professor Aarons.

1223
01:20:01,658 --> 01:20:04,058
Why, Will?
The guy's a loser.

1224
01:20:04,178 --> 01:20:05,978
Well, it's real simple.

1225
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,875
He's smart, he's straight,
he needs the help,

1226
01:20:08,876 --> 01:20:10,476
and I need the work.

1227
01:20:10,503 --> 01:20:12,503
I'm going down there,
pull another 6 or 8 points,

1228
01:20:12,622 --> 01:20:14,622
double his share--
it ain't impossible.

1229
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:18,270
What he got going now, it'll make me
look like a fuckin' miracle worker.

1230
01:20:18,394 --> 01:20:21,094
See? It's real simple.

1231
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,739
Yeah.

1232
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:28,353
Well, if they're out there,
I've seen the polling...

1233
01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:35,067
But, Will, we're not talking about
undecideds planning to vote here.

1234
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,666
You got 7 weeks to identify
and roust 50,000 people...

1235
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,694
...about as removed
from the system as he is.

1236
01:20:41,695 --> 01:20:45,895
That's when I figured that the votes
wouldn't be coming from Cade.

1237
01:20:53,708 --> 01:20:55,708
Are you going to make me ask?

1238
01:21:00,134 --> 01:21:01,934
Ask what, Will?

1239
01:21:02,068 --> 01:21:05,368
Your demographics, goddamn it!
The polls.

1240
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:06,982
You're right.

1241
01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:09,669
There's no time.
There's no money.

1242
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,570
I need them. Listen to me,

1243
01:21:11,629 --> 01:21:14,429
I'm calling everything in.
After this, you owe nothing to me.

1244
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:16,327
I owe--!

1245
01:21:16,871 --> 01:21:19,971
I don't owe you anything now,
all right?

1246
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:22,491
I left you for an opportunity.

1247
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:25,000
You didn't want to go with the guy,
I did, so I left.

1248
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:27,940
He was slime!
He didn't deserve getting you!

1249
01:21:27,941 --> 01:21:30,276
And I didn't deserve being left
in the middle of a campaign!

1250
01:21:30,277 --> 01:21:32,477
I didn't deserve that from you!

1251
01:21:35,048 --> 01:21:38,948
Hey-- goddamn it,
are you going to make me beg?

1252
01:21:40,993 --> 01:21:43,993
What in the hell did you do?

1253
01:21:44,093 --> 01:21:48,893
We billed Cade over $200,000
for those two polls.

1254
01:21:49,514 --> 01:21:51,358
That makes him
the biggest contributor...

1255
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,659
...to the Phil Aarons
for U.S. Senate campaign.

1256
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:57,405
It's illegal.

1257
01:21:59,534 --> 01:22:01,534
And it's stupid.

1258
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:12,821
We're running
short of time.

1259
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:17,388
From now on, this campaign
frames a single question:

1260
01:22:17,774 --> 01:22:20,174
"Is it or isn't it
time for a change?"

1261
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,643
<i>Now, we reshape the question,</i>

1262
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:24,444
<i>and make the other two guys
part of the problem.</i>

1263
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:26,994
But, the critical thing is,
we don't get bogged down...

1264
01:22:26,995 --> 01:22:28,895
...trying to come up
with the answers!

1265
01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:30,938
<i>By November, there's going to be
a feel out there...</i>

1266
01:22:30,939 --> 01:22:32,929
<i>...that you can do a better job
to find them.</i>

1267
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:34,990
- Look, I know you're--
- Phillip!

1268
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:37,821
I could squeeze you out the whole
foot and a half of bullshit,

1269
01:22:37,822 --> 01:22:40,248
but neither of us has the time.

1270
01:22:40,348 --> 01:22:43,331
Everything I learned in the last
26 years boils down to this:

1271
01:22:43,332 --> 01:22:46,920
if they like you,
they'll vote for you. Period.

1272
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,960
People don't vote issues,
they vote people.

1273
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:50,246
Yeah, but the whole point of--

1274
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:53,147
Phillip, you're the best guy
running, am I right?

1275
01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:56,938
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't believe that, right?

1276
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:00,167
I think that's why you called me,
in the first place.

1277
01:23:02,486 --> 01:23:05,186
Now, the leaves
are starting to turn.

1278
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,850
We got a debate
coming up, Phillip,

1279
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,100
with statewide exposure.

1280
01:23:10,672 --> 01:23:12,872
You got a question
you got to answer:

1281
01:23:13,357 --> 01:23:15,257
Phillip,

1282
01:23:15,337 --> 01:23:18,137
are you running for office
or running for principle?

1283
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,842
I hope I'm running for both.

1284
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:27,655
Oh, Phillip... Phillip!

1285
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:30,276
I'm personally convinced you'll do
a hell of a job once you get in,

1286
01:23:30,275 --> 01:23:33,075
but you got to get
through that door!

1287
01:23:33,994 --> 01:23:36,294
What's the price of admission?

1288
01:23:36,796 --> 01:23:39,106
<i>Why just kiss off
the middle class?</i>

1289
01:23:40,118 --> 01:23:42,118
I've seen some intriguing numbers.

1290
01:23:42,224 --> 01:23:44,224
A lot of them out there
like what you're saying,

1291
01:23:44,368 --> 01:23:46,168
but they're not going to
vote for you. You know why?

1292
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:49,108
Because they don't really know you.
They think they know you.

1293
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:50,408
They see you
without a tie,

1294
01:23:50,522 --> 01:23:52,422
wearing an old beat-up jacket
and chinos...

1295
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:54,134
They get frightened!

1296
01:23:54,268 --> 01:23:56,168
We're throwing those votes away!

1297
01:23:56,266 --> 01:23:58,643
On the gut issues, you're not
that far away from them.

1298
01:23:58,644 --> 01:24:00,991
You got to ease off on the ones
that you are, though.

1299
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:02,492
Look, Phil.

1300
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:04,154
They're scared about the future.

1301
01:24:04,259 --> 01:24:06,463
Whether or not they're going to
have a job next year.

1302
01:24:06,464 --> 01:24:08,364
You got to make sure
they really listen to you.

1303
01:24:08,606 --> 01:24:11,192
They all turn off when you
stand up wearing a flannel shirt,

1304
01:24:11,193 --> 01:24:14,993
and hiking boots, looking like you
just came off a picket line.

1305
01:24:17,654 --> 01:24:20,954
Yeah. That's all you got to do.

1306
01:24:29,828 --> 01:24:32,828
- Are you through with the file?
- Yes, I think so.

1307
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:34,881
I just want to make quite sure,

1308
01:24:34,941 --> 01:24:37,341
if there were any outstanding notes
on their property,

1309
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:40,759
any liens, things like that,
it would be recorded here?

1310
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:43,198
Well, are they residents here
and is the property here?

1311
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,368
- Yes, Georgetown.
- Then, it'll be here.

1312
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:47,069
Okay.

1313
01:24:47,518 --> 01:24:49,318
Thank you.

1314
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,021
Yeah, Ellen.

1315
01:24:58,131 --> 01:24:59,831
<i>All right, fellows,
bring the boxes in here.</i>

1316
01:24:59,979 --> 01:25:01,479
What?

1317
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:05,033
- What is going on out there?
- The pipes in the basement burst.

1318
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,917
There's 6 inches of water
down there.

1319
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:08,518
Yeah, say it again.

1320
01:25:10,785 --> 01:25:12,985
No, don't say it
over the phone.

1321
01:25:13,911 --> 01:25:15,911
I'll meet you there.

1322
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:19,049
4:30, right?
Yeah, bye.

1323
01:25:20,337 --> 01:25:22,337
What time will you be back?

1324
01:25:24,503 --> 01:25:26,303
<i>It never opened.</i>

1325
01:25:27,154 --> 01:25:29,728
The construction costs went
way over budget and...

1326
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:32,429
...they couldn't get the rents
they were asking.

1327
01:25:32,826 --> 01:25:34,626
I don't get it.

1328
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:39,811
The owner is the Liberty Mall
Development Corporation.

1329
01:25:41,629 --> 01:25:43,629
General partners...

1330
01:25:45,354 --> 01:25:48,354
...Arnold Billings and
Claire Hastings.

1331
01:25:52,339 --> 01:25:54,727
He advanced me some money.

1332
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:56,633
A lot of money...

1333
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:58,834
...for my share
in the partnership.

1334
01:25:59,138 --> 01:26:01,138
<i>Well, I bought this house and--</i>

1335
01:26:01,314 --> 01:26:05,114
redecoration got out of control,
I took a second advance.

1336
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,680
in anticipation of profits,
when they--

1337
01:26:08,907 --> 01:26:10,811
<i>sold the share to the
limited partners...</i>

1338
01:26:10,812 --> 01:26:13,112
...and the rents
started coming in.

1339
01:26:14,018 --> 01:26:18,218
That whole neighborhood was due
for urban renewal,

1340
01:26:18,443 --> 01:26:22,243
until it got killed
in some goddamn committee.

1341
01:26:22,912 --> 01:26:25,533
And, ludicrous as it may seem,

1342
01:26:25,534 --> 01:26:27,989
I still believed, even then,
that in the end...

1343
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,900
...everything was going to
turn out all right.

1344
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:34,125
When did Billings
start leaning on you?

1345
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:37,596
<i>In January.</i>

1346
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:41,571
He said a couple of clients
would be hurt...

1347
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:43,918
...by the new solar design
and he asked me...

1348
01:26:43,919 --> 01:26:47,063
...to persuade Sam
to stop pushing it.

1349
01:26:47,064 --> 01:26:50,034
I told him he was crazy!
I mean, my God, Sam--

1350
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:51,992
wouldn't listen to me
on the abortion!

1351
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:55,893
It was damned sure he wouldn't
listen on solar generation.

1352
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:59,107
This went on for a month,
six weeks,

1353
01:26:59,207 --> 01:27:03,107
and then, he brought up
a surprise:

1354
01:27:04,121 --> 01:27:05,921
the money.

1355
01:27:08,315 --> 01:27:10,615
How much money
did he give you?

1356
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:16,063
380,000 dollars.

1357
01:27:16,722 --> 01:27:18,722
<i>A little more.</i>

1358
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:23,153
What was so funny
was I thought...

1359
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,754
...that I could handle it--
and him!

1360
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:28,000
Even when he started to...

1361
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,944
...come to the house and
show up all the time,

1362
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,645
I still thought that I--

1363
01:27:31,736 --> 01:27:34,236
it was only a little kind
of intimidation.

1364
01:27:34,636 --> 01:27:36,331
And then, one day, he--

1365
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,536
walked right past me
into Sam's office, and...

1366
01:27:40,513 --> 01:27:43,613
...laid it on the line.
Laid it on the line!

1367
01:27:43,695 --> 01:27:46,295
And he asked Sam
to kill the appropriation.

1368
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:50,650
Sam threw him out of the house!
And then--

1369
01:27:50,736 --> 01:27:52,111
because of me, because--

1370
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:55,636
of what might happen to me,

1371
01:27:55,785 --> 01:27:57,716
he's walking away
from a job...

1372
01:27:57,717 --> 01:28:01,485
...that he's put his life
and soul into.

1373
01:28:04,296 --> 01:28:07,596
Remember when you
were here last...

1374
01:28:08,148 --> 01:28:11,748
...and you spoke about friendship?
You didn't tell me...

1375
01:28:11,872 --> 01:28:14,001
...that you had come here
to dig up something on us, but...

1376
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:17,618
...after you had left,
I knew why you had come!

1377
01:28:17,718 --> 01:28:22,118
That was one thing I could
figure out for myself!

1378
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:30,832
When you write this,

1379
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:35,154
make sure I am the monster.

1380
01:28:42,999 --> 01:28:45,579
Right, right, right.
Just send it to me. If, uh,

1381
01:28:45,578 --> 01:28:49,293
if I have any questions
I'll get back to you.

1382
01:28:50,043 --> 01:28:51,678
Yeah, okay.

1383
01:28:58,703 --> 01:29:02,003
I had a long talk with
Claire Hastings last night.

1384
01:29:03,902 --> 01:29:06,892
Well, I happen to know
Mrs. Hastings quite well.

1385
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:10,520
I don't know if she told you,
but we were business partners.

1386
01:29:11,148 --> 01:29:12,948
<i>I'm out.</i>

1387
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:15,975
I assume that means
you're resigning from...

1388
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:18,876
...the Cade campaign. Is that
what you mean, Mr. St. John?

1389
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:22,395
The plane. The phones.

1390
01:29:23,412 --> 01:29:27,012
Two clients canceling out,
what was the point?

1391
01:29:34,945 --> 01:29:37,845
The point-- to what?
The point is...

1392
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,247
...I didn't trust you, okay?

1393
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,419
I didn't want you
on this campaign.

1394
01:29:43,575 --> 01:29:46,051
One, you're much too close
to Hastings and, out of nowhere,

1395
01:29:46,052 --> 01:29:47,989
this Aarons jumps in the race,

1396
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:51,006
and your old pal Buckley
is calling the shots on that one?

1397
01:29:51,007 --> 01:29:53,007
No, no.

1398
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:56,327
Look,

1399
01:29:56,716 --> 01:29:59,816
we hired you to do a job,
Mr. St. John,

1400
01:29:59,999 --> 01:30:03,000
<i>and it wasn't to investigate
me and my company...</i>

1401
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:06,301
<i>...and it sure wasn't to exchange
information with your ex-wife.</i>

1402
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:12,406
Look, we wanted you to know...

1403
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,690
...that if you really
did try and screw us,

1404
01:30:15,691 --> 01:30:18,991
that something bad
could happen to you.

1405
01:30:19,215 --> 01:30:21,392
That's the message
we were trying to convey.

1406
01:30:21,393 --> 01:30:24,413
Now, the plane,
the phones...

1407
01:30:25,035 --> 01:30:27,635
...merely dramatic illustrations.

1408
01:30:31,005 --> 01:30:33,405
Don't you walk out on me.

1409
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:36,383
Oh, you think it's all
some kinda game, don't you?

1410
01:30:36,384 --> 01:30:39,984
You just walk in,
you jerk the locals around,

1411
01:30:40,003 --> 01:30:43,003
you put in whoever's paying you
and you leave.

1412
01:30:43,129 --> 01:30:45,929
It is no fucking game!

1413
01:30:46,053 --> 01:30:48,453
You are deciding
who's running this country,

1414
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:51,025
who's running other countries.
I care about that.

1415
01:30:51,325 --> 01:30:53,586
My clients have to deal
with the consequences.

1416
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:55,587
You don't give a shit!

1417
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:06,140
Look, I, uh--

1418
01:31:07,037 --> 01:31:09,230
Come on, we're the same guys,
you and me.

1419
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:12,990
Why don't you just do
what you've always done?

1420
01:31:13,001 --> 01:31:16,383
Just elect Cade,
and get paid,

1421
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:18,450
and leave.

1422
01:31:20,195 --> 01:31:22,695
What is the problem, Peter?

1423
01:32:26,687 --> 01:32:28,487
I hate this.

1424
01:32:29,248 --> 01:32:31,848
You're going to do good, Phillip.
Real good.

1425
01:32:31,966 --> 01:32:33,466
- I've got an idea.
- What?

1426
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:35,838
Instead of me trying
to impersonate a statesman,

1427
01:32:35,839 --> 01:32:37,841
when it's my turn to speak
maybe we should just...

1428
01:32:37,842 --> 01:32:41,142
...turn down the lights and run
"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington".

1429
01:32:41,701 --> 01:32:42,950
Now we're starting to move.

1430
01:32:42,951 --> 01:32:44,408
You could feel it
on our last trip.

1431
01:32:44,409 --> 01:32:47,409
You're framing the right message
and it's getting through.

1432
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,280
Will--

1433
01:32:54,587 --> 01:32:56,987
I know this is a real bad time.
Could I have a couple of minutes?

1434
01:32:57,062 --> 01:32:59,962
Yeah, you're right, it is bad.
We're just on our way out.

1435
01:33:00,131 --> 01:33:01,931
Phillip, this is Pete St. John.

1436
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:03,459
I've read about you.

1437
01:33:04,015 --> 01:33:05,415
Yeah. Hello.

1438
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:07,393
We'll talk later, uh?

1439
01:33:07,501 --> 01:33:11,640
Look, I gave you two polls.
You can give me two minutes.

1440
01:33:11,641 --> 01:33:14,641
What did I give you?
What did you do with it?

1441
01:33:15,735 --> 01:33:19,035
I sold out! All right, Will?
I sold out!

1442
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:21,292
He thinks because he won't work
for someone like Cade,

1443
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:23,017
...makes everything okay.
It makes me a shit...

1444
01:33:23,118 --> 01:33:26,610
...and him, some kind of
a holy crusader. We're the same!

1445
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,268
He got you this suit, right?

1446
01:33:29,462 --> 01:33:32,462
New haircut. Contacts.

1447
01:33:33,937 --> 01:33:37,337
And what you've been saying
has started to shift?

1448
01:33:38,398 --> 01:33:39,958
Have you softened anything
you were saying...

1449
01:33:39,959 --> 01:33:42,136
...before he came along
to help you out?

1450
01:33:42,829 --> 01:33:44,585
Hmm? Well, that's OK.

1451
01:33:44,586 --> 01:33:47,186
That's his job, to get you in.

1452
01:33:47,358 --> 01:33:50,958
Once you're elected, you can do
anything you want to do.

1453
01:33:51,356 --> 01:33:53,156
That sound familiar?

1454
01:33:55,648 --> 01:33:57,578
Look, I know I'm going to
hurt your feelings, but...

1455
01:33:57,579 --> 01:33:59,083
...you don't have a chance.

1456
01:33:59,084 --> 01:34:01,235
- You got a lot of gall--
- No, no, no, no--

1457
01:34:01,236 --> 01:34:02,836
It's OK, Wilfred.
I want to hear this.

1458
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,271
You're a bright guy,
you teach college,

1459
01:34:04,272 --> 01:34:07,015
just can't be news.
You do not have a prayer.

1460
01:34:07,918 --> 01:34:09,649
<i>It's just one of
those awkward realities...</i>

1461
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:13,950
<i>...we don't say out loud
in front of the paying clients.</i>

1462
01:34:16,762 --> 01:34:18,577
Instead of just going back
and teach History...

1463
01:34:18,578 --> 01:34:20,778
...why don't you go out there
tonight and make some?

1464
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:23,000
<i>You got nothing to lose!
Why don't you go out there...</i>

1465
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,435
<i>...stand up and say
exactly what you think?</i>

1466
01:34:26,023 --> 01:34:28,023
What you think!

1467
01:34:28,355 --> 01:34:30,855
Maybe even what you feel!

1468
01:34:31,403 --> 01:34:33,630
<i>Not what the polls say,
or what Wilfred says, or what I--</i>

1469
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:35,764
Are you saying
I can't handle my client?

1470
01:34:35,765 --> 01:34:38,963
Wilfred, I'm not talking about you.
You're the best of all of us.

1471
01:34:38,964 --> 01:34:40,856
But it doesn't mean a damn
who's running the show!

1472
01:34:40,857 --> 01:34:42,393
- It's a show!
- What do you want to do?

1473
01:34:42,394 --> 01:34:44,348
Go back to the old days?
Like it was before?

1474
01:34:44,349 --> 01:34:46,349
Have the machines
put their boys in?

1475
01:34:46,423 --> 01:34:49,028
Is that what you want?
Have the newspapers in charge?

1476
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:52,029
Have the "Los Angeles Times"
create another Richard Nixon?

1477
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:55,192
If you want to walk,
just walk. Go ahead.

1478
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:57,874
You shit on your own life,
not on mine.

1479
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,975
Come on, Phillip.

1480
01:35:14,577 --> 01:35:17,077
We're irrelevant.

1481
01:35:25,788 --> 01:35:28,188
But you're staying.

1482
01:35:29,551 --> 01:35:34,051
Those people there sure as hell
aren't going anywhere.

1483
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:41,887
Can you look at 'em and
say exactly what you feel?

1484
01:35:47,055 --> 01:35:49,955
I'm not saying you may not make
a horse's ass of yourself.

1485
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:54,204
But, just the spectacle of
something human out there...

1486
01:35:54,466 --> 01:35:58,087
...may make hordes of people
come tumbling out of their homes...

1487
01:35:58,088 --> 01:36:01,088
...in a huge tidal wave of emotion
and vote for you.

1488
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:07,019
You read the papers,
you got to know...

1489
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,156
...there's a higher voters' percentage
in Bolivia than in the U.S.

1490
01:36:12,762 --> 01:36:16,962
<i>I don't know, maybe they feel
connected to what's going on.</i>

1491
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:21,845
Maybe it takes too much
in America-- too much energy,

1492
01:36:21,846 --> 01:36:26,446
too much attention
to follow it all.

1493
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,216
Maybe that's why they like to get
their candidates predigested,

1494
01:36:31,326 --> 01:36:34,526
prepackaged, like TV dinners.

1495
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:40,992
I've become a very rich man
believing that.

1496
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:48,842
Prove me wrong.

1497
01:37:05,474 --> 01:37:07,304
Hi, Pete.

1498
01:37:23,165 --> 01:37:24,665
<i>Syd, come on.</i>

1499
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:26,908
<i>We can watch from the booth.</i>

1500
01:37:34,252 --> 01:37:38,452
<i>As President of the Ohio
League of Women Voters,</i>

1501
01:37:39,269 --> 01:37:42,069
<i>I wish to personally
welcome you...</i>

1502
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:45,480
<i>...to the United States
Senatorial debate tonight.</i>

1503
01:37:54,841 --> 01:37:57,010
The order of opening
and closing statements...

1504
01:37:57,110 --> 01:37:59,310
...was determined
this afternoon by lot.

1505
01:37:59,678 --> 01:38:02,778
Mr. Aarons will give
the first opening statement,

1506
01:38:02,827 --> 01:38:06,027
followed by Mr. Westbrook
and Mr. Cade.

1507
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:14,370
- Mr. Aarons.
- Thank you, Mrs. Bernhardt.

1508
01:38:15,282 --> 01:38:18,004
For those of you who still
don't know who I am,

1509
01:38:18,005 --> 01:38:21,545
I'm the guy for whom this job
actually means a raise in pay.

1510
01:38:21,995 --> 01:38:23,470
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1511
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,895
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1512
01:38:28,584 --> 01:38:30,353
<i>I would like to remind you...</i>

1513
01:38:30,354 --> 01:38:31,920
...to please refrain
from any kind...

1514
01:38:31,921 --> 01:38:34,654
...of public demonstration
during the debate.

1515
01:38:40,559 --> 01:38:42,559
I, uh,

1516
01:38:42,994 --> 01:38:45,194
feel very uncomfortable
right now.

1517
01:38:46,841 --> 01:38:49,161
I feel uncomfortable
standing up here,

1518
01:38:49,162 --> 01:38:51,062
under all these lights,

1519
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:55,030
trying to fit what I believe in
into a 180 seconds.

1520
01:38:55,447 --> 01:38:57,247
But more than that,

1521
01:38:57,319 --> 01:39:01,019
I feel uncomfortable with the job
of being a candidate.

1522
01:39:01,532 --> 01:39:03,961
<i>With trying to convince you
that by electing me...</i>

1523
01:39:03,962 --> 01:39:05,832
<i>...to the U.S. Senate...</i>

1524
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,995
<i>...you're going to get
a better job,</i>

1525
01:39:07,996 --> 01:39:10,196
<i>you're going to
make more money,</i>

1526
01:39:10,335 --> 01:39:13,535
<i>that your lives are somehow
going to magically improve,</i>

1527
01:39:15,609 --> 01:39:18,009
because that's not
going to happen.

1528
01:39:18,574 --> 01:39:21,274
It's not going to happen
if you elect me,

1529
01:39:21,369 --> 01:39:24,369
or Mr. Cade
or Mr. Westbrook.

1530
01:39:25,655 --> 01:39:27,211
Therefore,

1531
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:30,355
I am not going to ask you
now for your vote.

1532
01:39:30,795 --> 01:39:32,545
I am going to ask
that you listen to me...

1533
01:39:32,546 --> 01:39:36,246
<i>...for the next few minutes, and
during the rest of the debate,</i>

1534
01:39:36,328 --> 01:39:39,028
<i>and then just think about
what I've said.</i>

1535
01:39:39,734 --> 01:39:43,739
I think that, above all else,
our real problems--

1536
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:46,440
chronic poverty,
shrinking resources,

1537
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:48,530
are long-term.

1538
01:39:48,732 --> 01:39:50,772
<i>But the solutions
we're being given...</i>

1539
01:39:50,773 --> 01:39:53,576
<i>...are designed to get
the politicians elected,</i>

1540
01:39:53,577 --> 01:39:55,777
<i>not to solve the problems.</i>

1541
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:57,450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1542
01:39:57,654 --> 01:39:59,654
Ladies and gentlemen!

1543
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:04,690
Once more I remind
the audience...

1544
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:06,910
...not to cheer or applaud.

1545
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:09,536
<i>You only take time away
from your candidate.</i>

1546
01:40:09,827 --> 01:40:12,327
<i>You only take time away
from your candidate.</i>

1547
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:14,123
<i>Thank you.</i>

1548
01:40:14,338 --> 01:40:17,338
Right now,
right here in Ohio,

1549
01:40:17,805 --> 01:40:20,505
why can't we be the first
to forget about the election?

1550
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:23,626
<i>And think past November.
And past next year. And--</i>

1551
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:27,041
<i>maybe even beyond our own
lifetimes and begin to...</i>

1552
01:40:27,042 --> 01:40:29,642
<i>...really think about
the real answers.</i>

1553
01:40:29,877 --> 01:40:33,077
<i>If there is an early pattern
in this off-year election,</i>

1554
01:40:33,174 --> 01:40:34,708
<i>is that the voters...</i>

1555
01:40:34,858 --> 01:40:37,174
<i>...are sending a strong signal
to the politicians,</i>

1556
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:39,451
<i>saying any politician
who takes them for granted...</i>

1557
01:40:39,524 --> 01:40:41,724
<i>...does so at his or her
own peril.</i>

1558
01:40:41,838 --> 01:40:44,138
<i>For instance, Senate races
in New York, Florida and Oregon,</i>

1559
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:47,030
<i>had been predicted by the experts
as easy contests.</i>

1560
01:40:47,031 --> 01:40:48,431
<i>They're horse races.</i>

1561
01:40:48,564 --> 01:40:51,564
<i>Jim Hart, it's an hour or so
before the polls close in the West.</i>

1562
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:54,160
<i>What do our exit polls
show us so far?</i>

1563
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:57,230
<i>Roger, one contest in which
the experts appear to be right,</i>

1564
01:40:57,377 --> 01:41:00,077
<i>though it was exceptionally
bitter and hard-fought</i>

1565
01:41:00,224 --> 01:41:04,224
<i>and closer than expected, is the
New Mexico gubernatorial race.</i>

1566
01:41:04,307 --> 01:41:05,607
<i>Based on our numbers,</i>

1567
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:08,021
<i>we believe that congressman
Frank McKusker...</i>

1568
01:41:08,022 --> 01:41:10,322
<i>...will wind up with about
53% of the vote,</i>

1569
01:41:10,516 --> 01:41:12,716
<i>defeating millionaire
Wallace Furman...</i>

1570
01:41:12,949 --> 01:41:16,649
<i>...who spend more than
an estimate of $5,000,000...</i>

1571
01:41:17,983 --> 01:41:19,983
<i>Wallace, I'm sorry!</i>

1572
01:41:22,276 --> 01:41:25,276
Oh, yeah, Wilfred called me
last week.

1573
01:41:26,777 --> 01:41:28,677
Yeah? How is he?

1574
01:41:29,271 --> 01:41:31,671
Well, he was pretty upset
when he called.

1575
01:41:31,851 --> 01:41:34,104
Something about
you storming in...

1576
01:41:34,105 --> 01:41:36,205
...like the mad prophet of doom.

1577
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,623
That's the way he put it.

1578
01:41:39,222 --> 01:41:42,322
He was pleased
you left Cade.

1579
01:41:43,485 --> 01:41:45,885
But he seemed, hum--

1580
01:41:45,952 --> 01:41:49,152
upset about something
you'd said to Aarons.

1581
01:41:49,382 --> 01:41:51,682
<i>What did you say
to him, Pete? He--</i>

1582
01:41:51,935 --> 01:41:54,235
<i>wouldn't be specific.</i>

1583
01:41:55,411 --> 01:41:57,611
The truth, I think.

1584
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:00,650
Finally, all he had to offer
was himself.

1585
01:42:07,264 --> 01:42:11,001
<i>Thank you. Based on our
ABC exit polls,</i>

1586
01:42:11,002 --> 01:42:13,326
<i>and early results from
key precincts...</i>

1587
01:42:13,476 --> 01:42:16,359
<i>...in the State of Washington,
we're now projecting...</i>

1588
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,786
<i>...that incumbent Governor
Andrea Stannard...</i>

1589
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:20,987
<i>...will win a second
four-year term...</i>

1590
01:42:21,178 --> 01:42:22,978
Thank God.

1591
01:42:24,619 --> 01:42:26,619
Well done.

1592
01:42:28,773 --> 01:42:30,273
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

1593
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,390
Thank you. Thank you.

1594
01:42:34,832 --> 01:42:37,232
You having problems
with your story?

1595
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:39,626
How do you mean?

1596
01:42:39,722 --> 01:42:41,722
It's just that
I haven't seen it yet.

1597
01:42:42,053 --> 01:42:43,553
I'm surprised, that's all.

1598
01:42:43,606 --> 01:42:45,406
No. No, it's fine.

1599
01:42:45,494 --> 01:42:47,994
Just a-- a mess.

1600
01:42:49,466 --> 01:42:51,266
You having trouble
finding sources?

1601
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,300
Oh, uh--

1602
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:55,910
No, no.

1603
01:42:57,706 --> 01:42:59,506
What is it?

1604
01:43:00,468 --> 01:43:02,268
I, uh--

1605
01:43:02,483 --> 01:43:06,283
I just-- I decided
not to do a story about, uh...

1606
01:43:06,392 --> 01:43:08,392
Sam and Claire, that's all.

1607
01:43:09,973 --> 01:43:11,473
Why?

1608
01:43:14,478 --> 01:43:16,754
Well, first of all,
Sam didn't commit any crime.

1609
01:43:16,755 --> 01:43:18,355
He didn't do
anything wrong.

1610
01:43:18,444 --> 01:43:20,344
The only person who did
anything was Claire.

1611
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:22,779
<i>Billings went into business
with a Senator's wife...</i>

1612
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,380
<i>...and tried to influence
his vote.</i>

1613
01:43:24,491 --> 01:43:26,358
Of course, it's nasty and
it's against all the rules,

1614
01:43:26,359 --> 01:43:28,159
but it's just
a question of degree.

1615
01:43:28,246 --> 01:43:29,958
The man's basically
a lobbyist, right?

1616
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:32,258
That's what he gets paid for,
trying to influence votes.

1617
01:43:32,259 --> 01:43:34,059
Do you know what
the real story is?

1618
01:43:34,184 --> 01:43:36,184
Foreign influence
in American elections.

1619
01:43:36,256 --> 01:43:39,256
Do you know what
I found out since--?

1620
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:44,430
That's what's going in
next week, anyway.

1621
01:43:44,579 --> 01:43:45,979
I don't believe this!

1622
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:48,006
Even I think Sam and Claire's
a terrific story.

1623
01:43:48,007 --> 01:43:50,499
I hate the idea of it--

1624
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:53,125
You're not getting
human on me, are you?

1625
01:43:53,675 --> 01:43:55,275
Hey.

1626
01:43:58,205 --> 01:44:01,205
I don't believe this.
You're not blushing, are you?

1627
01:44:06,089 --> 01:44:08,389
- Hmm?
- Excuse me.

1628
01:44:10,227 --> 01:44:12,627
<i>Certainly, one of the big
surprises of this election night--</i>

1629
01:44:12,728 --> 01:44:14,328
<i>and we're having
a lot of them--</i>

1630
01:44:14,462 --> 01:44:17,008
<i>was the apparent second-place
finish by an independent...</i>

1631
01:44:17,009 --> 01:44:19,109
<i>...running for the Senate
in Ohio.</i>

1632
01:44:19,239 --> 01:44:20,639
<i>Phillip Aarons,
not long ago,</i>

1633
01:44:20,830 --> 01:44:23,330
<i>was an unknown
college History professor.</i>

1634
01:44:23,438 --> 01:44:26,618
<i>He has been beaten by
Michael Westbrook, a republican,</i>

1635
01:44:26,619 --> 01:44:29,019
<i>but now clearly,
and some say, miraculously,</i>

1636
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,647
<i>he will finish ahead
of Jerome Cade...</i>

1637
01:44:31,648 --> 01:44:34,548
<i>...in a contest that
no-one had predicted.</i>

1638
01:44:35,628 --> 01:44:37,628
<i>As you can hear,
the excitement and...</i>

1639
01:44:37,684 --> 01:44:40,084
<i>...enthusiasm here at
Phil Aarons' headquarters...</i>

1640
01:44:40,217 --> 01:44:42,617
<i>...is running high and wild.</i>

1641
01:44:43,522 --> 01:44:45,522
<i>You get the impression
from these young people...</i>

1642
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:49,160
<i>...that their man has just won
the Presidency of the U.S.,</i>

1643
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:51,779
<i>when in fact,
he lost an election.</i>

1644
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:55,269
<i>Phil's phools fooled
the political experts...</i>

1645
01:44:55,389 --> 01:44:58,389
<i>...by catapulting their man
from a virtual unknown...</i>

1646
01:44:58,445 --> 01:45:01,245
<i>...to a second place
in the highly contested freeway...</i>

1647
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,500
We are number two!

1648
01:45:05,085 --> 01:45:07,985
<i>Now, let's go to the podium
for the man of the hour,</i>

1649
01:45:08,089 --> 01:45:09,989
<i>in what many here
consider to be...</i>

1650
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:11,894
<i>...a victory speech.</i>

1651
01:45:13,656 --> 01:45:16,156
<i>He's about to address
his cheering supporters...</i>

1652
01:45:16,274 --> 01:45:18,274
<i>...and the American public.</i>

1653
01:45:19,179 --> 01:45:21,179
Good night.

1654
01:45:27,597 --> 01:45:30,597
<i>Something that none
of the commentators,</i>

1655
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,745
<i>none of the newspapers,</i>

1656
01:45:32,895 --> 01:45:37,044
<i>none of the so-called
"media wizards" predicted...</i>

1657
01:45:37,045 --> 01:45:39,045
<i>...came into this race.</i>

1658
01:45:42,729 --> 01:45:44,229
<i>Something...</i>

1659
01:45:44,377 --> 01:45:46,977
<i>...something human
came into this race.</i>

1660
01:45:47,077 --> 01:45:50,977
<i>Some straight talk,
some honest feeling,</i>

1661
01:45:51,045 --> 01:45:53,645
<i>something that wasn't slick
and prepackaged,</i>

1662
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:57,780
<i>that wasn't engineered
by these media wizards,</i>

1663
01:46:04,094 --> 01:46:05,894
<i>We...</i>

1664
01:46:08,471 --> 01:46:12,071
<i>...we, together,
have achieved...</i>

1665
01:46:12,136 --> 01:46:15,136
<i>...that historic moment
in politics.</i>

1666
01:46:15,954 --> 01:46:20,654
<i>And we have come too far
to turn back now.</i>

1667
01:46:32,506 --> 01:46:34,206
<i>Tonight...</i>

1668
01:46:35,387 --> 01:46:37,087
<i>...tonight...</i>
