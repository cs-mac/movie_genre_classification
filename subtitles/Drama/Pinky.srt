1
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,977
Good morning, ma'am.

2
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,772
Sure is a fine day today, isn't it?

3
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,862
Getting this washing up.
Should've had it up long ago too.

4
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,492
If it's Aunt Dicey Johnson you're
lookin' for, ma'am, here I be.

5
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,798
Pinky?

6
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,765
Pinky, child?

7
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,102
Yes, Granny. It's... It's me.

8
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,524
Pinky. My Pinky.

9
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,322
Thank you, Lord, for
bringing my child back to me.

10
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:04,911
She'd be such a far piece and long journey,
and this be the morning of her return.

11
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,120
Amen.

12
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,497
Granny.

13
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,543
No frettin', honey. 'Cause
you're home safe and sound.

14
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,589
Come on in and let Granny scare
you up a mite of breakfast.

15
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,882
Come on.

16
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,014
Come on, sugar. Come on.

17
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,235
Oh, me. It sure do me good
to see you standin' there.

18
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,448
Just think. My Pinky baby all growed
up and come home to her old granny.

19
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,991
How did you know I'd come back?

20
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,911
That's why I sent you away,
sugar, so you'd come back.

21
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,373
Come back and help the
sick, the halt and the needy.

22
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,796
Remember what I say the
day I put you on the train?

23
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,759
I said, "Pinky, baby,
no matter how far you go

24
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,638
"how much you learn, you gotta
bring it all back with you.

25
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,266
"That's why I'm sending
you. Because the Bible say,

26
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,520
"A little leaven shall
leaven the whole lump. "'

27
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,483
Granny...

28
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,741
Granny, did you ever think
I might wanna stay up north?

29
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,953
There's some things we gotta
trust the Lord about, Pinky,

30
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,288
some things we can't do ourself.

31
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,999
We gotta depend on him.

32
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,672
Everything just like you left it, sugar.

33
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,779
What is it, Pinky?

34
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,157
Oh, I wish you'd never sent me away.

35
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,368
You mean, you wish you'd growed up
ignorant, no-account good-for-nothin'?

36
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,246
You wish you'd never learned to read and
write and make your way in this world?

37
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,041
Oh, no, but don't you see?

38
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,794
Yes, Pinky, I do see.

39
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,215
Let me say something once
and for all and never again.

40
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,635
Why is it you write me
less and less as time go by?

41
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,806
Why is it after you go to the
hospital, I get no letter at all?

42
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,893
No. You don't need to say
nothin'. You think I don't know.

43
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,229
You think poor old ignorant woman
like me livin' in a shack like this

44
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,941
don't know nothin',
but you're wrong, Pinky.

45
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,903
I do know. And I know what you done.

46
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,990
And you know I never told you
to pretend you is what you ain't.

47
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:55,456
I didn't mean to,
Granny. It just happened.

48
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,501
But that's a sin before
God, and you know it.

49
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:03,255
It was a conductor on the train. He put
me back in another car, the white one.

50
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,341
But he knowed who you was.
I put you where you belonged.

51
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,550
No. No, no.

52
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,512
It was after that, when
they changed conductors.

53
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,014
Then why you ain't
tell the new conductor?

54
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,891
Granny, I don't know.

55
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,519
I was only a child.

56
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,604
Then what about school? What about that?

57
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,023
Other children talk about
their kinfolks, don't they?

58
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,528
What you say when they asked you about
your'ns? You tell 'em who your granny is?

59
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,784
Oh, shame, shame be on you, Pinky.

60
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,871
Denying yourself like Peter
denied the good Lord Jesus.

61
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,250
Here. Get down. Get down.

62
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,337
That's where you belong. Now
you tell the Lord what you done.

63
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,215
Ask his forgiveness
on your immortal soul.

64
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,136
Come on out and get your breakfast. I
don't wanna hear another word from you

65
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,138
about what you done
again as long as you live.

66
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,152
Tom.

67
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,406
Tom. Tom, please.

68
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,492
Please, Tom. Tom.

69
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,954
Tom.

70
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,999
Tom!

71
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,406
Good morning, honey. You up, I see.

72
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,991
Yes, Granny.

73
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,420
You do this much every day?

74
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:52,508
Ain't missed a day 'cept the time I was
down sick with pneumonia three years ago.

75
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,051
Here. I'll help you.

76
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,846
I ain't sent you away for you
to come back and take in washing.

77
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,600
Granny, I was awful glad when
you stopped sending me money.

78
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,102
What you mean?

79
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,354
I didn't want you breaking
your back for me forever.

80
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,024
Stopped? I ain't never missed
once. I give Jake Waters that money,

81
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:12,403
just like I been doin'
every week since his pa died.

82
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:18,033
I gotta see Jake about that.
Kind of superstitious about him.

83
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,912
I'll go see Jake. I'll
get it back for you.

84
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,164
How much do you get
for a wash like this?

85
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,667
Oh, they don't count, far as money goes.

86
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,085
You mean you're not paid for it?

87
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,379
'Course not. They're Miss Em's.

88
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,007
Yeah. I can see it's Miss Em's.

89
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,426
You mean to say she
doesn't pay you for it?

90
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,593
Not in cash money.

91
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,806
Miss Em ain't got no cash money.
Besides, she's old now, old and sick.

92
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,058
She has a house full of
valuable antiques, hasn't she?

93
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,476
But they're family things.

94
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,228
Can't sell them.

95
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,318
Besides, why are you
so set agin Miss Em?

96
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,903
She ain't never hurt
you. Look at her house.

97
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,574
Slave-built, slave-run
and run-down ever since.

98
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,039
I went through that gate in her garden
once, just once, when I was a little girl.

99
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:08,459
She ordered me out, and
I'll never forget it.

100
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,837
Oh, Miss Em ain't never liked children
traipsin' around in her garden.

101
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,007
Why, when she had that boarding
school, she made them girls play

102
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,176
on the other side of the house.

103
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,347
Guess I'll look in on her now like I do
every morning to see if she's all right.

104
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,476
Tom. Tom.

105
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,438
I’ll send him a
telegram. Western Union.

106
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:16,068
I want to send a telegram.
Yes. Straight wire.

107
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,490
"Dr. Thomas Adams.

108
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,495
"St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Boston.

109
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,834
"Darling. All a terrible mistake.

110
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,880
"Returning by the first train.

111
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,885
"Meet me at the station, please.

112
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,641
"I love you, love you,
love you, love you. "

113
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,251
Get up there. Come
on, you lazy devil. Come on.

114
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,989
Can you tell me where Jake Waters lives?

115
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,657
Right down on the corner.

116
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,117
Thank you.

117
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,417
Hi, Tommy. Hi.

118
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,516
This where Jake Waters lives?

119
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,358
You're Jake Waters, aren't you?

120
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,068
Uh, yes, ma'am, I am.

121
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,528
This is my house here.

122
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,446
I'm Patricia Johnson.

123
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,200
Who? You know Mrs. Dicey Johnson,
don't you? I'm her grandchild.

124
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,452
Pinky?

125
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,042
Well, what do you know?
Come right in, Miss Pinky.

126
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:41,463
I'm mighty glad to see
you. Mighty glad. Yes.

127
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,674
I've come to get the money my
grandmother gave you to send me.

128
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,759
Oh, the money! Come on in.

129
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,013
I've been tryin' to get over to see your
granny, but every time I start over there,

130
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,848
something happens to stop me.

131
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,060
Yes, sir. Mighty busy
these days. Mighty busy.

132
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,980
This won't take long. I shan't ask you

133
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,940
why you held back the money
so long as you return it.

134
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,735
Oh, sure, sure. Don't
worry about it. Sit down.

135
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,115
Oh. You know,
you've been away a long time.

136
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,741
What about the money?

137
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,910
You'll get it. You'll
get it. Every cent of it.

138
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,287
Sit down.

139
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,251
Why'd you come back, Miss Pinky?
Never figured that you would.

140
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,253
Why shouldn't I? This is my home.

141
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,879
Don't give me that, Miss Pinky.

142
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,758
Jake's smart. He sees
things. Man most likely, huh?

143
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,096
White man? Couldn't tell him
and couldn't not tell him, huh?

144
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,306
Look, Jake, I haven't got all...

145
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,308
Of course. Didn't mean
to be nosy, Miss Pinky.

146
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,351
Jake's your friend. He
only wants to help you.

147
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,688
Help me by giving me back
my grandmother's money.

148
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:44,443
Oh, yes. The money. Well, I
never keep much cash money on me.

149
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,819
Keep it all in the bank, Miss Pinky.

150
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,029
Is it far to the bank?

151
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,698
Bank's closed today. Saturday.

152
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:53,160
Very well. You can give me
whatever you have on hand

153
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,746
and I'll tell my grandmother
you'll pay her the rest on Monday.

154
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,789
Of course, I never keep
much money around the house.

155
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:00,042
Mind giving me what you have?

156
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,379
Just a minute. I'll look around.

157
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,570
This every bit of money I got in
the house. A ten and a five makes $15.

158
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,739
I'll tell my grandmother
you'll give her the rest on Monday.

159
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,658
Monday. Sure. You
be sure and come by Monday.

160
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,909
I'll be there, all right.

161
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,160
Jake, what's she doin' with my money?

162
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,079
Rozelia, you know I didn't...
What you doin' with my money?

163
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,331
Rozelia, you know who that
is? Miss Pinky. I don't care.

164
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,166
Miss Pinky, that happens to be my money.

165
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,542
Let go of me!

166
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,294
Come high, don't you? Drop that.

167
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:48,382
Why, you... I'll split you open
if you don't give me my money.

168
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,759
Hey there. What's up?

169
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,020
What's goin' on here?

170
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,563
Nothin' at all, Captain.

171
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,691
Everything's all right now.

172
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,275
They been botherin' you, ma'am?

173
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,444
Pull your dress up, girl.

174
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,200
Got a knife, Chief. CHIEF: Okay. Get it.

175
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,042
Well, I reckon it's just as
well we come up when we did.

176
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,045
Uh, just what was the trouble, ma'am?

177
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,714
I don't care to make any charges.

178
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,882
Just a minute, if you please.

179
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,637
I reckon you're a stranger in this part
of the country, but this fella Jake,

180
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,056
did he molest you in any way, ma'am?

181
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,224
No. No.

182
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,810
And the girl. What about her, ma'am?

183
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,522
She even so much as thought of
threatening you, we wanna know about it,

184
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,898
or if she give you any of her impudence.

185
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,067
Shut up, girl.

186
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,987
Excuse me, sir, but why are you
two white men "ma'am-ing" her?

187
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,906
She's nothin' but a
low-down colored gal.

188
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,783
Tried to steal my man.

189
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,577
Make him stop! Make him stop!

190
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,456
You heard what she said. He's got
to slap her down, unless it's true.

191
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,293
Yes, it's true. I'm colored. My
grandmother's Mrs. Dicey Johnson.

192
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,546
Mrs. Dicey Johnson! I oughta
slap 'em both down, Chief.

193
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,047
Nah. Hold it.

194
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,968
Why, I think I'll be going now. Go?

195
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,220
You ain't goin' anywhere till
I tell you. Get in that car.

196
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,805
I'm under arrest?

197
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,099
What do you think? On what
charges are you holding me?

198
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,810
You heard what I said. Get in that car.

199
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,237
Don't worry. I'll fix
it. I know the judge.

200
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,364
Let me handle this.

201
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,312
It looked like there was gonna be
some trouble, and I searched her.

202
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,607
Then I took this knife off her,
Judge Walker. It was in her garter.

203
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,901
So I just brought 'em all in.

204
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,695
Is this your knife?

205
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,156
She's the one started trouble,
comin' takin' my money.

206
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,283
That'll do. Find
anything on the other one?

207
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,035
Didn't search her.

208
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,463
Nothin' there, Judge.

209
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,923
She had plenty time to throw it away.

210
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,384
Rozelia, I could send you
up for this knife business.

211
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:38,510
Yes, sir.

212
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,887
And I will if I hear one
more word about this matter

213
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,390
about a knife or razor or any trouble.

214
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,808
Is that clear? Yes.

215
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,893
Now, go. Thank you, sir.

216
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,770
As for you, Jake...

217
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,980
Yes, sir. I was just...

218
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:51,690
You've been in this
kind of trouble before.

219
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,608
After this, keep your hands
off other people's money.

220
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,987
No, sir. Never touch a
nickel that ain't mine, sir.

221
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,030
I'm going to let you off this time.

222
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,532
Thank you. Much obliged, Judge.

223
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,741
But next time will be the last.

224
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,618
Yes, sir. Thank you.

225
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,037
Now it's to you, Pinky.

226
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,748
If Jake owes you money and
doesn't pay it, let me know.

227
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,500
I'll see that he does.

228
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,918
Thank you.

229
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,839
I remember years ago,
after your mother died.

230
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:20,385
I remember when Dicey sent you away
to school. Aunt Dicey's a good woman.

231
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,511
I've always thought highly of her,

232
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,305
and I'd like to be able to
think well of her grandchildren.

233
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,557
I've done nothing, Judge Walker,
and I'm telling you the truth.

234
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,892
I'm not saying you aren't, but...

235
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,727
But because I'm colored,
you don't believe me.

236
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,313
You're not sure. That's it, isn't it?

237
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,525
How'd you make out up yonder?

238
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,071
I graduated, then I took three
years' training as a nurse.

239
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,492
Oh, I didn't know. You managed to
do all that on what Dicey could send?

240
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,244
Yes.

241
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,247
I won scholarships. I worked,
waited tables. I got along.

242
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,125
Oh, that's good. That's very
good. All the more reason

243
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,795
you should keep on being a credit
and comfort to your grandmother.

244
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,381
You've had advantages which are
denied to most members of your race,

245
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,259
people like Jake and
Rozelia, for example.

246
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,722
Just try to keep out
of trouble. That's all.

247
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,891
Thank you, sir.

248
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,285
Pinky. Yes, Granny?

249
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,287
Why don't you try and...

250
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,791
Going somewhere, honey?

251
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,459
Just for a walk.

252
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,015
Evenin', Sister Johnson.

253
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,141
Come in, Jake.

254
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,061
Stop sneakin' in here
behind me like that too.

255
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,564
I told Miss Pinky I'd drop around,
so here I is, man of my word.

256
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,652
Good. Pinky give me the $15 you give her,
said you'd be here to give me the rest.

257
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,530
I guess she was kind of riled
after that little run-in.

258
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,824
Run-in? What
you mean, run-in?

259
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,367
Oh, nothing.

260
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,619
You workin' mighty late, Sister Johnson.

261
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,121
Oh, I reckon I'll die

262
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:15,500
with the shoes on my feet and that old
smoothin' iron in my hand, good Lord willing.

263
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,628
You're a worker from way
back yonder. Yes, sir.

264
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,797
I always admire a good worker.

265
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,507
Look who's talkin'.

266
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,345
Well, there's work and then there's
work. My biggest work, I do with my brain.

267
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,724
Liable to get top-heavy
overworking that brain, eh, Jake?

268
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:35,478
That's the way to rise up in the world.
No more being the skim milk for Jake.

269
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,564
He's gonna be the cream on top.

270
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:40,442
Cream gotta be cream
first before it rise.

271
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,943
Where you goin', Sister?

272
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,070
I gotta take this
wash back to Miss Em's.

273
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,034
Give me that.

274
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,493
Don't you want me to read it for ya?

275
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,828
Give it back, I say. It's mine.

276
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,954
I can see... I can see that.

277
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,789
Give me that letter!

278
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,211
Not gonna read this letter to nobody.

279
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:07,802
Well, you burned it up, didn't
you? That ain't gonna stop nothin'.

280
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,682
I got a feeling that a fast letter coming
like that is a shadow moving before.

281
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,892
Think so, Jake?

282
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:17,353
Folks is coming, they come
treadin' on their shadows.

283
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,357
Course, I can stop him. Got his name
and address right here in my head.

284
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:25,737
Didn't I tell you I worked with my
brain? I can write a letter to him.

285
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,074
Say, I never seen no
colored man write like that.

286
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,911
Two stamps on the letter and his name and
address in the corner with "M. D." after it.

287
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,537
That means doctor.

288
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,873
You think you'd be doing right?

289
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:41,878
You wanna keep Miss Pinky, don't
you? I'll send him a telegram.

290
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,798
That'll stop him just like that.

291
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,344
Don't you worry, Sister. Jake's
gonna take care of everything.

292
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:55,475
Course, telegrams cost money, and I
like to do everything business-like.

293
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,522
That'll be a deductible
item from what I owe you.

294
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,234
Evenin', ma'am. Can we give you a lift?

295
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,777
No, thank you.

296
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,365
Excuse me, ma'am. You must be a stranger
around here. We can't let no white girl

297
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,826
walk by herself through
this here nigger section.

298
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,911
I live in this section. You what?

299
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,164
I said I live here.
Now, just let me alone.

300
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,291
Lives here? What do you know?

301
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,293
Who'd ever figure that?

302
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,510
That's the whitest dinge I ever saw.

303
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,679
Look at that swamp rabbit go.

304
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,230
What do you say, let's go get her?

305
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,065
Boy, let's go now.

306
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:50,006
We ain't gonna hurt you, baby. Don't be
afraid, baby. We ain't gonna hurt you.

307
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,799
We just wanna have a little fun, baby.

308
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,343
Take it easy.

309
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,261
Come here, honey.

310
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,388
No! No! Stop! Stop!

311
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,141
Please! Don't! Don't!

312
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,560
What a build on her.

313
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,231
Let's see your face,
baby. Hold up your face.

314
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,651
Oh, you're pretty. You're
pretty. You're real pretty.

315
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,613
What's the matter,
baby? You want a drink?

316
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,073
Hey, Al, give me that bottle.

317
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,954
Come back here, gal!
Come on back here, gal!

318
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,121
Ah, let her go.

319
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,897
Pinky? Pinky?

320
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,609
Pinky? Granny?

321
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:34,736
Yes.

322
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,489
What you got the door locked for?

323
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,699
Granny, what is it?

324
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,784
What's wrong? Tell me, Granny.

325
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,245
It's Miss Em. Miss Em, honey.

326
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,830
What's the matter with her?

327
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,499
Oh, Doc Joe say it's her heart again.

328
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,543
Her heart give out.

329
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,463
It happened while I was
puttin' the linen in the closet,

330
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,965
talkin' to her when she took her spell.

331
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,136
So I run down to the corner
fast as I could, phoned Doc Joe.

332
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,513
He picked me up on the way
back. He come that fast.

333
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,557
Her heart? How old is she?

334
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,352
Oh, a year or two older than me maybe.

335
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,812
Course, she never allow that to my face.

336
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,775
Lord, I kinda hoped you'd take
me before you took Miss Em.

337
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,694
I kinda hoped you
would. Thy will be done.

338
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,572
Everyone has to die, Granny.

339
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,616
You're right, baby,

340
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,702
but the least we can do
is ease their passin'.

341
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:29,415
I'm so glad you're here. Seems like the
Lord sent you here out of pure goodness.

342
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,541
Me?

343
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,045
I say, "Doc Joe... " I
say, "Never you mind. "

344
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,382
And was I proud to say it.
I say, "Never you mind, sir.

345
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,218
"My Pinky's here, and
she's a good nurse. "

346
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,053
So he's sittin' there
waitin' for you right now.

347
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,554
You told him I'd nurse her?

348
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,683
Course, honey. Doc Joe say
everything depend on good nursing.

349
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,769
He say she gotta have a trained nurse,

350
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,355
and he can't lay his hand
on one for love or money,

351
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,982
if Miss Em had the
money, which she ain't.

352
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,568
Then tell him to keep right
on looking. I'm not interested.

353
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,237
But she'll die. Then let her die.

354
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,321
Pinky!

355
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,241
I didn't mean that, but, Granny,
try to understand my side.

356
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,910
I only came back here because
I hadn't anywhere else to go.

357
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,412
I'd forgotten what it was like.

358
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,914
I've been away a long time.
I've known another kind of life.

359
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:14,502
I've been treated like a human being.
Try to understand, like an equal.

360
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,674
Don't you see I can't go back into that
house? Haven't I had enough without that?

361
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,967
Pinky.

362
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,682
I worked long and hard
to give you an education,

363
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,018
and if they done educated
the very heart out you,

364
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:34,439
everything I've worked and
slaved so hard for is wrong.

365
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,400
Now, hear me! You're
goin' up to Miss Em's!

366
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,778
You're gonna take good care
of her, like the nurse you is,

367
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:45,074
or I swear on the Holy Bible, I'll
rip the livin' daylights out you!

368
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,306
Yes. I'm going away. I should
never have come back here.

369
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,151
Here. Let me help you.

370
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,616
Kind of wrinkled. Reckon I'd
better run the smoothin' iron

371
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,701
over it before you pack it.

372
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:35,249
Kind of pretty too. Must take a heap
of studying, learning to be a nurse.

373
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,960
The course is three years, as you know.

374
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,880
Miss Em didn't have no training at all.

375
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:41,964
Why should she?

376
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,675
Her kind never learns anything useful.

377
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,594
Didn't stop her from nursing me, though,

378
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,096
when I was down sick with
pneumonia, fixin' to die.

379
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,933
Miss Em nursed you?
I'd like to see that.

380
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,980
Where you been living, child? What
sort of stuff they teach you up yonder?

381
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:03,277
Have I put in all my work on you for you to
turn out to be nothin' but low-down trash?

382
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,286
Yes, Pinky. Miss Em did nurse me.

383
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,498
If you don't believe me, ask Doc Joe.

384
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,751
Miss Em stay here, sleep
in your little room.

385
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:23,422
She cook for me, feed me with a
spoon, wash my poor, tired body.

386
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,510
Even emptied my slops like
she was my loving servant.

387
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,971
Now she's fixin' to die

388
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,016
and my own grandchild done
hardened her heart agin her.

389
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,593
Doctor.

390
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,096
Oh, yes. Glad you could
come. She's at pretty low ebb.

391
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,182
Under the hypo right now.

392
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,559
No fear of disturbing her.

393
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:04,148
Oh, yes. Pinky, isn't
it? A nurse. Of course.

394
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,861
Your granny's talked a lot about
you, but I didn't realize that...

395
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,990
Uh, some things I've
jotted down here for you.

396
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,078
Really not very much
we can do right now.

397
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,874
She's reached the age where the
mechanism begins to slow down.

398
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:27,213
If she has another attack...
Have you ever given a hypo?

399
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,715
I'm a graduate nurse.

400
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,926
Yes, yes, of course.

401
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:36,597
Well, I'm very glad to leave
Miss Em with a graduate nurse.

402
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,351
No phone in this house, and
I'm pretty hard to get hold of,

403
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,687
so it'll be a matter of
using your own judgment.

404
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,314
I understand, Doctor. Your hat.

405
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,526
Oh, no. Here.

406
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,611
Yes. Thank you.

407
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:57,702
You know, of course, that Miss Em
can't afford to pay for a trained nurse.

408
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,870
Or do you? I know, Doctor.

409
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,540
Might be some of her old
pupils could pay you something.

410
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,666
Most of them still live...

411
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,418
No, Doctor. It isn't
a question of money.

412
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,795
I'm doing it for my grandmother.

413
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,298
Well, I'll look in tomorrow afternoon.

414
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,134
Good night, Doctor.

415
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,855
Who are you?

416
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,150
I'm your nurse.

417
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,029
Dicey's girl, Pinky, aren't you?

418
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,033
Yes. Why didn't you say so?

419
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,203
Come over here and let me see you.

420
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:31,045
You didn't call yourself Pinky when
you were off up yonder, did you?

421
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,797
No.

422
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,132
Speak up. What name did you go by?

423
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,467
Patricia.

424
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,430
Pinky's better.

425
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:48,229
What are you doing there?

426
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,314
Dr. McGill left some pills for you.

427
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,652
You didn't think I'm gonna take any
more of Joe McGill’s stupid dope?

428
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,988
They'll relieve the pain,
Miss Em. You are in pain?

429
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,699
Course I'm in pain. What do you think?

430
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,160
That you die in ease and ecstasy?

431
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,454
What's this thing on my feet?

432
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,748
Hot water bottle.

433
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,458
Take it away. I won't have it.

434
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:13,254
Brick's much better.
Over there on the hearth.

435
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,590
Put it in the embers.

436
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,679
Go to the wardrobe. Open the door.

437
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,645
Look on the second shelf. You'll find
a bit of blanket to cover the brick.

438
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:34,233
Take your hands out of there.
I said the second shelf.

439
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,402
Miss Em, I'm not dishonest,
if that's what you're implying.

440
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,779
Furthermore, I don't have to...

441
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,614
Miss Em?

442
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,285
Miss Em!

443
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,955
Miss Em.

444
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,783
Now, make tracks, y'all.
Don't wanna see hide nor hair of ya

445
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,159
till tomorrow.

446
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,790
That you, Pinky honey?

447
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,291
Yes, Granny.

448
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,001
Miss Em ain't...

449
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,045
No. She's better.

450
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,048
Praise the Lord.

451
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,598
Dr. Joe's with her now. He said for
me to come on down and get some rest.

452
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,976
You're supposed to sit with her
for the rest of the afternoon.

453
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,352
Then you get some sleep, honey.

454
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,562
I don't feel like sleeping.

455
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,023
What you doing with my clothes?

456
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,985
With you being so busy and all,
I reckoned I'd unpack for you.

457
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,405
Put them back. They can
stay packed till I leave.

458
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,449
It's only a matter of
a few days, at the most.

459
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,910
Doc Joe say that? A few days?

460
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:55,624
I can see for myself. Oh, for heaven's
sake, Granny, it's only a mean old woman.

461
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,836
She's been driving me and nagging me
ever since she woke up this morning.

462
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,296
She do that? That's good.

463
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:02,506
What's good about it?

464
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,009
Then she do feel better, sure enough.

465
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,804
Miss Em start feelin' better,
the more "coniferous" she act.

466
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:12,099
Pay no attention to her worrisome ways,
sugar. She don't mean nothin' by it.

467
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,852
She means to put me in
my place and keep me there

468
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,479
just as she's kept you all these years.

469
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:22,401
Oh, Pinky child, when folks is real
friends, there ain't no such thing as place.

470
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,783
Hello? Anybody home?

471
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,911
Miss Johnson?

472
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,294
I beg your pardon.
You're Miss Pinky Johnson?

473
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,885
Yes, sir. You're looking for me?

474
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,220
I'm Dr. Canady from over in Leesburg.

475
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,263
How do you do, Doctor?

476
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,391
My wife and I heard you were here. We'd
like you to come over to the house to dinner.

477
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,811
Well, that's... If you'll just set
the date, any night that's convenient.

478
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,689
I'm on a case now, and
after that, I'm going away.

479
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:04,735
When you come back then. Your being here
is the best news we had in a long time.

480
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,654
We had some girls over in
Leesburg, high school graduates,

481
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,615
with no chance for regular training.

482
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,658
With your help, we can set
up a real nursing school.

483
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,452
It's out of the question.

484
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,663
You see. Excuse me. How are
you and your family these days?

485
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,582
Fine, thank you, Aunt Dicey.

486
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,084
You see, I...

487
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:22,377
I'm not planning to come back.

488
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,926
I see. I have never been north.

489
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,011
I took my M. D. at Meharry.

490
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,598
I was tempted to go, of course,
but I felt my job was here.

491
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:39,645
These girls I was telling you about, it's
gonna be kind of hard to disappoint them.

492
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,648
I'm sorry, but my plans are all made.

493
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,692
Well, good luck to you, Miss Johnson.

494
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,423
Get the feet.

495
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,889
Mind that candlestick.

496
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,894
My great-grandfather bought that when
they sold Thomas Jefferson's things.

497
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,565
Things. Hmm. They last
longer than people.

498
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,610
This furniture was made
to present to Henry Clay

499
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,989
if he was elected, but the
voters thought different,

500
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,575
and Grandfather bought it at auction.

501
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,495
Look what you've done. My best brooch.

502
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:43,167
Well, you've looked at it long enough.

503
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,210
What do you think of it?

504
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,670
It's very nice, Miss Em.

505
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,173
Don't be evasive. I want the
truth. What do you think of it?

506
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,008
It's one of those
rather clever imitations

507
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,594
one can buy in the chain
stores for a dollar.

508
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:57,598
Ninety-eight cents. Any
fool would know that.

509
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,352
Now, go dust that center table.
Bring me a pitcher of water.

510
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,646
Miss Em, I've already done
those things, and you know it.

511
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,940
Don't be impudent. It isn't
impudent to say what's true.

512
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,611
I'm a trained nurse, and I
won't be spoken to like that.

513
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,908
You don't like it
here, why did you come?

514
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,701
Because my grandmother said

515
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,661
she'd whip the living
daylights out of me if I didn't.

516
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,832
That Dicey. Nobody
like her. Did she really say that?

517
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,210
That's the sort of answer
you want to hear, isn't it?

518
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,502
No.

519
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,671
I prefer the truth.

520
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,675
You forgot that fire screen.

521
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,182
Don't be so upset. I'll be dead soon

522
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,060
and you'll be free to
go back north again.

523
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,438
Going to give up your nursing
when you get back up yonder?

524
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,776
Nursing's my profession. In certain
places, a nurse is treated with respect.

525
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,322
Nobody deserves respect as long as
she pretends to be something she isn't.

526
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,700
How I live my life is
my own business, Miss Em.

527
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:02,829
Course it is. It isn't your
husband's business or your children's.

528
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,376
You can go now, Pinky. I'll be all
right till your grandmother comes.

529
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,588
You can't dismiss me as you did when I was
a child and you drove me out of your garden.

530
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,383
Oh, you remember.

531
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,677
Yes. Very clearly.

532
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,390
What do you want me to do, stay here and
live this sort of life when I don't have to?

533
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,268
Just prove you're addicted to
the truth, like you pretend.

534
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,270
Wherever you are, be yourself.

535
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,524
What am I then? You tell me. You're the
ones that set the standards, you whites.

536
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,818
You're the ones that judge people
by the color of their skins.

537
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,152
By your own standards,

538
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,989
by the only ones that matter
to you, I'm as white as you are.

539
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:41,451
That's why you all hate me. What should
I do? Dye my face? Grovel and shuffle?

540
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,911
Say "yes'm" and "no'm"?

541
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:46,999
Marry some man like Jake Waters?
Carry a razor in my stocking?

542
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,044
Nobody hates you, Pinky.

543
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,758
Don't just stand there. When
you leave the room, go quickly.

544
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,427
I hate dawdling.

545
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:21,950
Pat!

546
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,210
Oh, darling. Oh, if you only knew
what I went through finding you.

547
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,175
What's wrong? What got into
you, running off like that?

548
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,760
How did you find me?

549
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,512
I got your old address
from the nuns' school,

550
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,932
and then that crazy telegram
came, signed Pinky Johnson.

551
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,434
Why "Pinky"?

552
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,936
I didn't send you any wire.

553
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,774
Come on. Come on up to the house.

554
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,195
What's it all about, Pat? I can
see you're working, but why here?

555
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,282
Why didn't you want me to know?
What are you doing, charity work?

556
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,701
No. I live here.

557
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:15,879
Is that it?

558
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,758
Is it because you were ashamed of
telling me you lived in a place like this?

559
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,469
I often wondered why you never spoke
about your home and family, but...

560
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,597
Don't you know who lives
in this kind of house?

561
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,814
Come on in.

562
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,027
Come here, Tom.

563
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:46,451
There's an old colored woman
who can't read or write,

564
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,579
a washerwoman people
around here call Aunt Dicey.

565
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:54,126
There's the basket she carries her
clothes in. There's the ironing board.

566
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,505
And those are the heavy irons
she heats on that old wood stove.

567
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,384
Year in and year out,
she's washed and ironed

568
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,470
and carried her clean clothes
to people's back doors,

569
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:08,473
through rain and cold
and the heat of summer.

570
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,270
And she saved her money and lived
on scraps white people gave her.

571
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:17,524
Why? For me. So she could
send me off to school,

572
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,860
so I could learn to be a nurse.

573
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:24,865
So her granddaughter would be spared
the kind of life she's had to live.

574
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,536
Her granddaughter?

575
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,329
Yes. Her granddaughter.

576
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,539
Me.

577
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,500
Now you understand.

578
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,300
Pat... My name is Pinky.

579
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,733
She's coming. Tom, please, please go.

580
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,902
I don't want her to find you
here. I've got a car. We'll drive.

581
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,989
No. No. Not until you tell me
the whole story. Come on, Pat.

582
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,194
And then, that day at the hospital,
I met you for the first time.

583
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,030
At first, I tried to keep you away,
even to the point of being rude.

584
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,699
That's true, isn't it? Remember?

585
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,410
But you wouldn't give up.

586
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,331
I thought I could take the chance
of seeing you, being with you.

587
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:02,462
I'd never been in love. I never
dreamed it would ever be serious.

588
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:09,010
When I found it was, a kind of
daring came over me, with your love.

589
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,721
So I thought I could have everything.

590
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,932
For a few weeks I believed it,

591
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,351
until you wanted to
get married right away.

592
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,480
Remember? You said I'd have
to make up my mind sometime.

593
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,819
Then I realized what my
decision would have to be.

594
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,072
So I ran.

595
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,825
Poor Pat...

596
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,536
I'm not looking for pity, and
don't tell me it doesn't matter.

597
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,162
I couldn't stand that.

598
00:48:36,247 --> 00:48:38,957
I won't lie to you.
Of course it matters.

599
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,877
It makes... Makes problems,
important problems.

600
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,922
But let's try and face
them like rational people.

601
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,133
Rational.

602
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,015
What's rational about prejudice?

603
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,361
I don't think I'm prejudiced. I'm a
doctor and I hope enough of a scientist

604
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:12,490
not to believe in the mythology
of superior and inferior races.

605
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,870
It is a tricky business, though.

606
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,957
You never know what exists
deep down inside yourself.

607
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:25,837
I want to be absolutely sure nothing
like that exists inside of me.

608
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,966
You'd be so easy to hurt, Pat.

609
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,637
In this case, too much kindness
could easily be misunderstood

610
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,805
and hurt worse than cruelty.

611
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,394
A man should be able to lose
his temper and cuss out his wife

612
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:44,439
once in a while without her
misunderstanding the reason.

613
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,777
That's why I didn't give way to
my impulse when you first told me.

614
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,363
I wanted to sort of hold myself under
a microscope a little bit longer,

615
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,657
till I could be sure I was right.

616
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,741
What do you mean?

617
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,244
I've got two reservations
on the plane from Birmingham.

618
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:09,673
I don't know.

619
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,344
Come on, Pat. We've got
an hour to catch our train.

620
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:15,512
No, no. Wait. Wait.

621
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:20,141
Darling, I love you.
Tom, we can't... Wait...

622
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:24,854
I couldn't help myself, even if I
wanted to. I don't know. I don't...

623
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,732
That's the important thing. The rest
of it we can work out between ourselves.

624
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,402
It'll be our secret. Nobody
else will ever know it.

625
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,747
Here.

626
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,543
Come on. We'll stop at your
house and pick up your things.

627
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,711
Tom, I can't go with you now.

628
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,462
Why not? Not now. I'm on a case.

629
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,547
Let them get somebody else.

630
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,382
This isn't just a case. It's
a debt that has to be repaid.

631
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,218
That's the true reason? Oh, I swear
it is. I'm through with running away.

632
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,971
You're being honest? You promise
you'll come as soon as you can?

633
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,389
I'll take the next train.

634
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,516
If you don't, I'll be
here wanting to know why.

635
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,934
Oh, I will!

636
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:20,910
George,
you still drive too fast.

637
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,370
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,625
Well, shut off the engine.

639
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:44,309
About time. Oh, so you're the one.

640
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:48,271
I'd heard you were light,
but I'd no idea you were...

641
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,648
Well, you're practically white.

642
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,611
What is it that you want, please, ma'am?

643
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,070
I'm here to see Miss Emma.

644
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,198
I'm sorry. She's not
supposed to receive visitors.

645
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,450
I'm her cousin, Mrs. Wooley.

646
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,785
Oh, yes, Mrs. Wooley.

647
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,412
Well, if you'll wait down here,
I'll see if Miss Em can see you.

648
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,080
How is she?

649
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,167
She's improving. Won't
you have a chair, please?

650
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,308
Miss Em, I'm afraid...

651
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,727
I know. Let her come up. But
don't leave me alone with her.

652
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,103
She'll wanna be alone with you, Miss Em.

653
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,313
Well, I don't.

654
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,107
How is my
dear Cousin Em today?

655
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,406
Well, I'll find out.

656
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,867
Sit in that chair.

657
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:46,412
If I knock over the bell, tell her I have to
have an enema or something. Get rid of her.

658
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,497
But Miss Em, I've just
started your luncheon.

659
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,707
Do what you're told, honey.

660
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,338
Oh, Mrs. Wooley, Miss
Em can see you now.

661
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,006
I know. I can hear.

662
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,926
Cousin Em, what do you
mean, gettin' sick like this?

663
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,512
When you're 80 years old, you
expect to be sick. Sit down.

664
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:06,599
Now, now. Naughty, naughty.
Eighty years young is what we say.

665
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:10,103
I don't. It's old, and I
won't have it minimized.

666
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,857
Takes a lot of livin' to get
there and pure, cursed endurance.

667
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,525
Eighty years young indeed!

668
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,694
Yes, yes, Cousin Em. Of course.

669
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,529
That's all now. I'll be
sitting here with Cousin Em.

670
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,281
Stay there, Pinky.

671
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,784
She's a trained nurse. I want
her there in case I have a spell.

672
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,788
Oh. Now, tell me, dear.
Are you being taken care of?

673
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,206
What can I do for you?

674
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,624
Nothing.

675
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:35,545
Jeffers and I have been away on holiday,
and we didn't know a thing until yesterday.

676
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:40,174
I said to Jeffers, "I'm gonna see Cousin
Em tomorrow no matter how busy I am.

677
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,887
"I just have to know whether she's
getting every single thing she needs. "

678
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,890
And Jeffers said to me, "Melba, that's
just like you. You can never rest

679
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,892
"till you know you've done your duty.

680
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,770
"And if you can take a little sunshine into
the life of that poor old soul, you'll... "

681
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,442
Cousin Em?

682
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,196
She's nappin'.

683
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,369
Or is she doped?

684
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,747
Just tired. She's been very ill.

685
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,168
Well, I'll just sit
here till she wakes up.

686
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:20,214
Oh, Pinky, I do believe I forgot to
tell George to put the brake on my car.

687
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,800
Go down there and make sure it's on.

688
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,766
Cousin Em...

689
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,935
I never nap, and I'm not doped.

690
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,437
My goodness, she's whiter than I am!

691
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,939
Prettier too.

692
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,358
Well, it just gives me the creeps.

693
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,860
Seriously, Cousin Em. I gotta
talk to you alone. It's important.

694
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:44,822
I came in to warn you about this girl, Pinky.
My new maid, Rozelia, knows all about her.

695
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:48,326
Now, Melba. I'm not gonna soil my
ears by listening to kitchen gossip.

696
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,788
But for all you know, lyin' up here
in bed, she's stealin' you blind.

697
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,040
Oh, Melba.

698
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,961
I think I left my brooch
over there on the bureau.

699
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,629
See if it's still there.

700
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,172
Well, I certainly will.

701
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,968
I most certainly will. That's
just what I been talking about.

702
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,471
Oh, is this it? Yes.

703
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,182
Well, thank
goodness. It's still here.

704
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,812
Mrs. Wooley, George says
your brake is still on.

705
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,565
What do you think of the brooch? Hmm?

706
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:25,071
Oh! Oh, it's lovely, Cousin
Em. Priceless. A real antique.

707
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,739
Why do you ask?

708
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,866
Oh, I know you like jewelry.

709
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:33,371
Just wanted to be sure. I was
thinkin' of makin' my will.

710
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,666
Oh, Cousin Em, you mustn't
think of such a thing.

711
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,626
Why, it isn't as if you
had a lot of relatives.

712
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,254
Jeffers and I are the only two you got.

713
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,550
And I know how strongly you feel
about keepin' things in the family.

714
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:50,096
What an idea to make a will. Why,
you'll live years and years, dear!

715
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:54,642
Pinky's a nurse. She graduated from
one of the best hospitals up yonder.

716
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:58,479
Let's ask her. Think I
should be makin' my will?

717
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:02,483
Well, if you were ever gonna make a will,
Miss Em, it's time you were getting it done.

718
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:07,196
There, Melba. There's a
nurse's opinion. Very sensible,

719
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,533
especially as it agrees with my own.

720
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,202
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.
Miss Em must rest now.

721
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:14,871
Well, she looks fine to me,

722
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,582
and besides, we haven't finished
our little visit yet, have we?

723
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:21,294
I do feel a little queer. Maybe
I have another fit comin' on.

724
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,005
Fit? That's the way they start.

725
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,299
Then I go clean out of my head.

726
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:32,263
Well, in that case, I guess
I had better be on my way.

727
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,308
Oh, you going? But you'll
come back, won't you?

728
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,476
Oh, yes, dear.

729
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,646
I'll be in first thing
next week. I certainly will.

730
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:44,150
And no more nonsense about
making a will, you naughty girl.

731
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,069
No more nonsense!

732
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,659
Stop that. I won't have you
laughing at my relatives.

733
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:57,038
Sorry, Miss Em. She's not
a blood relative, is she?

734
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,457
She married my cousin, Jeffers Wooley.

735
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,876
He's my first cousin, once removed.

736
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,671
He nearly removed himself clean out
of the family when he married her.

737
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,300
Jeffers never
did have much sense.

738
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,179
His father wanted him to study
law. Didn't have the brains for it.

739
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,599
Took up insurance. Tried
to sell me a policy.

740
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,102
Life insurance, he called it.

741
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:23,147
I asked him if it would insure that I should
live one day longer that the Lord allows.

742
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,192
He said it didn't, so I said,
"Well, call it death insurance.

743
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:30,196
"You oughta be ashamed mentioning
it to one of your own family. "

744
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:36,828
Why are you standing there for?

745
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,622
Do you want tea or milk with your lunch?

746
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,665
Coffee.

747
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:41,916
Miss Em, you know the doctor said...

748
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,377
I said coffee, and make it strong.

749
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,087
Yes, Miss Em.

750
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,799
And, Pinky, when you bring my tray

751
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,926
bring me paper, pen and ink.

752
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,680
When you've washed the dishes, you
can take the rest of the afternoon off.

753
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,723
I don't like to leave
you alone, Miss Em.

754
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,433
Then send Dicey over.

755
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,852
She can't stay long.

756
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,979
This is her afternoon to
take the wash into town.

757
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,272
Don't argue.

758
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,900
Do as I say. Don't want you
back here till after 5:00.

759
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,695
Yes, Miss Em. Make that coffee strong.

760
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,738
I want the spoon to stand up in it.

761
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,282
Yes, Miss Em.

762
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,159
Miss Em!

763
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:11,941
Miss Em! Miss Em.

764
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,442
Why am I in bed for?

765
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:14,777
Thought I was sittin' in a chair.

766
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,153
You've had another attack.

767
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,281
You've been up and doing too much.

768
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,866
Whose business is it if I do
too much, I'd like to know?

769
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,202
Nobody's at all if you
want to shorten your life.

770
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,913
Flat on her back. No. No. Prop me up.

771
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,332
Give me some pillows.

772
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:31,210
I'm not gonna lie flat
until I'm laid out.

773
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,879
Be soon enough now.

774
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,299
Might as well let her have her own way.

775
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,260
That's all I ever wanted,
to have my own way.

776
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,929
Here. Open your mouth.

777
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,307
What's that? Dope?

778
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,017
Open your mouth.

779
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:54,317
I want some fresh water.
It's stuck in my throat.

780
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,235
No, I said fresh water.

781
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,702
Close the door behind you.
There's a draft in here.

782
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,041
I don't want that girl
knowin' my business.

783
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,085
Now, go over there and
look on the second shelf

784
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,587
in that book.

785
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,465
No, no. The other end. The other end.

786
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,092
There. Now, open the book.
There's an envelope in it.

787
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:23,721
Get the envelope. Bring it here.

788
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:28,392
That's my will, and I
want you to witness it.

789
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:29,477
Of course. Surely.

790
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,645
No. You don't have to read
it. I just want you to sign it.

791
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:36,525
Here. You'll have to sign
it again in my presence.

792
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,652
You know my signature.

793
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,321
Sign it again, please.

794
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,365
These things have to be done legally.

795
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:47,620
Oh, lawyers have more fool
rigamarole than doctors.

796
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:52,041
There. Now, put it back in the envelope.

797
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,627
Seal it up.

798
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,797
Put it away.

799
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,009
Who's your executor?

800
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,178
You are. Me?

801
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,806
Isn't Judge Walker your lawyer?

802
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,349
He's retiring.

803
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,684
Aren't you my friend?

804
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,527
No. Never mind that now.

805
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,196
I don't need it. It's gone down.

806
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,909
You didn't think I'm
plannin' to die this minute?

807
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:30,830
I'll be up to meet my
classes right after holidays.

808
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,918
My school...

809
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,464
What'll the girls be
doin' with me in bed?

810
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,094
Don't you worry, now. You'll
be up and around in a few days.

811
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,221
Try to get some sleep now.

812
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,852
A fine woman. One of the old school.

813
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:39,648
Never afraid to speak her mind or take
a stand for what she thought was right.

814
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,233
How long, Doctor?

815
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,485
Can't tell.

816
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:46,739
Extraordinary vitality,
but the last attack...

817
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,202
Perhaps a week. Perhaps
only a few hours.

818
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,787
Isn't there anything...

819
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:57,750
There, now. You did a good job.

820
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,420
I might even say a devoted job.

821
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:06,467
Well, I'll stop in first thing tomorrow.

822
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,178
Good night. Good night, Doctor.

823
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,450
Twenty cents, please.

824
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,874
Somethin' for ya, ma'am?

825
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,917
Yes. Do you have any
mourning veils, please?

826
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,878
Right this way, ma'am.

827
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:18,015
This is our best quality, ma'am, 2.98,

828
01:06:18,433 --> 01:06:20,559
and the last we got in stock.

829
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,771
Yes. That'll be fine. I'll take it.

830
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:26,732
I'll allow you're goin' to
Miss Em's funeral, ma'am.

831
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,109
They say she had a lot
of friends. Miss Viola.

832
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,945
Come wait on me, please. Sorry,
Ms. Wooley. Just a minute, please.

833
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,239
I'll be right with
ya. Where's Mr. Goolby?

834
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,201
Excuse me, please, ma'am. I only
meant I was waitin' on someone.

835
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,327
Mr. Goolby!

836
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,996
I only have to wrap this and
get the change. Mr. Goolby!

837
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,582
Why, yes, Mrs. Wooley, what can
I do for you today, please, ma'am?

838
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:47,586
Since when has it been your policy
to wait on nigras before white folks?

839
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:51,173
Why, I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley. I'm...

840
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,842
I'm sure that Miss Viola
just... Just didn't see you.

841
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,344
Miss... Miss Viola.

842
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,221
Well, I'm... I'm sorry, Mrs. Wooley.

843
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:00,808
I should think you would be. I'll repeat...
Since when has it been your policy...

844
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:04,144
Now, just what would you be interested in
this morning? We have some nice broadcloth.

845
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,230
We also have some... What's that?

846
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:10,526
Well, that's the money, the
money, ma'am, she gave me, $5.00.

847
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,281
Is that Miss Em's money?

848
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,409
No, Mrs. Wooley.

849
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,456
Would you mind tellin'
me where you did get it?

850
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,876
I don't care to say where
I got it, Mrs. Wooley.

851
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:31,046
Well, that's all you'll get away
with. You can rest assured of that.

852
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:32,464
Charge this.

853
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,467
What's going on?

854
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,054
I'll take my veil now, Mr. Goolby,

855
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,056
unless you don't sell to colored people.

856
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:45,811
I'm in business to sell goods, and
your money's good if it's honest money.

857
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,105
It's honest money. My
grandmother earned it

858
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,316
by harder work than selling
goods over a counter.

859
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,487
Do you wish to sell me the veil?

860
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,159
4.98.

861
01:08:02,454 --> 01:08:06,123
Very well, Mr. Goolby.
My change, please.

862
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,324
When are you fixin' to leave, honey?

863
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,537
In the morning.

864
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,581
There's a train at 9:00.

865
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:53,378
Then, in that case, I'm gonna
fix ya a nice, hot supper tonight.

866
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,465
Oh, Granny, please
don't trouble yourself.

867
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,966
I don't...

868
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,974
Howdy, Aunt Dicey. AUNT
Howdy, Doc Joe.

869
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,268
Howdy, Pinky. Here.
Have a chair, Dr. Joe.

870
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:09,853
Somebody sick out this way?

871
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,021
No. Nobody's sick.

872
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:15,526
I got some news for you, and I thought
the sooner you knew it, the better.

873
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,403
Copy of Miss Em's will.

874
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:21,532
She left her pa's law books
to her cousin, Mr. Wooley.

875
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,408
Family portraits too.

876
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:25,702
And her jewelry to Mrs. Wooley.

877
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:29,706
Good, 'cause Mrs. Wooley sure likes
all kinds of geegaws and fixin's.

878
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,668
"To my faithful servant and
friend, Dicey Johnson, colored,

879
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:36,171
"I leave all personal clothing
of which I died possessed. "

880
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:39,842
Bless her heart. Sometimes I think
she always get her shoes extra big

881
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,095
'cause when these fit her just
right, they pinch my bunion.

882
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,098
And I'm mighty proud
to have her clothes too.

883
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,351
Miss Em left you the house,
Pinky, and everything in it.

884
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,728
The land too, about 20 acres.

885
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,148
"The remainder of my
estate I give and bequeath

886
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:58,151
"to the aforesaid Dicey
Johnson's granddaughter, Pinky.

887
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,698
"This bequest being an expression
of my genuine regard for her

888
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:06,535
"and my confidence in the use to
which she will put this property. "

889
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,537
That what the paper say?

890
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,455
Here. Read it for yourself.

891
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,624
It say it for a fact, Doc Joe?

892
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,877
That's the way she wrote it.

893
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,255
But if I were you, I
wouldn't count on it just yet.

894
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,757
You see, the Wooleys,
Mrs. Wooley in particular,

895
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,843
figured on gettin' all that stuff.

896
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,220
Hear they've already hired a lawyer.

897
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:28,098
You mean, they're gonna
contest it? On what grounds?

898
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,976
Undue influence, I suppose,

899
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:36,064
question Miss Em's
sanity, that sort of thing.

900
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,567
There's already been some talk.

901
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,820
So that's why Mrs. Wooley
and those men in town...

902
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,407
Don't you think Miss Em was sane?

903
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,534
Far as I know, she was.

904
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:50,495
That last night her mind wandered a bit

905
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,497
but that's not unnatural.

906
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:56,168
You just keep that if you
want to look it over some more.

907
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,004
But I don't believe
I'd count on gettin' it.

908
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,131
Better wait and see.

909
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:05,260
I don't know how the folks
around here are gonna take this.

910
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,527
I wonder why she did it.

911
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,617
Ain't you gonna finish
your fried chicken, honey?

912
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:33,372
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.
I wonder why she did it.

913
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,917
Well, Miss Em had grown
powerful fond of you.

914
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:39,586
But she should've known better.

915
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,464
Pinky, I've lived in
this world a long time,

916
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,259
long enough to know for sure if it's
somethin' white folks don't want you to have

917
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,261
or somethin' they want for their self,

918
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,305
you might as well forget all about it.

919
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,516
But she meant me to have it.

920
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,977
"Expression of my genuine regard for her

921
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:59,147
"and my confidence in the use to
which she will put this property. "

922
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,315
What did she mean?

923
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,693
That don't mean nothin' where
the white folks is concerned.

924
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,319
'Sides, you goin' back
up yonder, so why...

925
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,960
Evenin', Sister Johnson.
Evenin', Miss Pinky.

926
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,503
Hello, Jake.

927
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,674
Well, I just started uptown, and
I thought I'd stop by for a while.

928
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,844
Well, Miss Pinky, I hear as how
you got some property comin' to ya.

929
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,220
What else have you heard?

930
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:31,430
Well, the white folks are sayin'

931
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,141
you kept Miss Em doped all the time.

932
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,475
They say she must have
been out of her head,

933
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,811
and you must've made
her write that will.

934
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:39,438
It's nonsense, and they know it.

935
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,689
Is or ain't, I don't know.

936
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,442
But it sure spells trouble for somebody.

937
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:46,778
If I was you, Miss Pinky, I'd stick
close to the house for a while.

938
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,488
She's leavin' first
thing in the morning.

939
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,614
Goin' back up north?

940
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,783
Yes. That's good.

941
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,453
That's mighty good.

942
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,372
Then Ms. Wooley get
the property by default.

943
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,666
Everything's fine,
no trouble for nobody.

944
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,084
Is that the law?

945
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:04,796
Default? Well, unless you get
a lawyer to file an answer.

946
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:09,843
Of course, me, I've had considerable
dealings with the law, but I ain't licensed.

947
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:13,513
But even if I was licensed,
I wouldn't touch your case

948
01:13:13,598 --> 01:13:16,475
for a stack of hundred
dollar bills that high.

949
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,978
I got a nice house
and no fire insurance.

950
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:26,318
And I'm glad you decided to
be sensible about this thing.

951
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,279
Because if you hadn't, I was gonna
make reservations across the state line

952
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,032
and go fishin' for three or four weeks.

953
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:38,288
Oh, what is it? What is it, child?

954
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:51,927
Pinky.

955
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:57,182
Pinky, tell me. What
are you fixin' to do?

956
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:05,315
I'll be staying on for a while,
till this business is settled.

957
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,276
Miss Em meant me to have the house

958
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:11,613
and I'm not gonna give it
up to please Mrs. Wooley

959
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,406
or anybody.

960
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,579
Granny.

961
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,800
Can't do it, Pinky. You
know that I'm retiring.

962
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,636
As judge, yes, sir. But that
leaves you free to take my case.

963
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,805
Frankly, I don't want
to get mixed up in this.

964
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,850
There's too much feelin', too many
tales around about you and Miss Em.

965
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,101
They're not true, sir.

966
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,061
Possibly they're not, but...

967
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,605
Say, perhaps you could
compromise, settle it out of court.

968
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,941
I'm sure Mrs. Wooley would
be generous. With my property?

969
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,526
Court'll decide whose it is.

970
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,278
It won't even come up before the court,

971
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,405
unless I can induce a
lawyer to act for me.

972
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,576
But you don't want a lawyer who thinks
the will was ill-considered and a mistake.

973
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,496
All right, sir. Good-bye.

974
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,669
Judge Walker, Miss Em
was your lifelong friend.

975
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,212
Whether the will was a mistake or not,

976
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:12,299
wouldn't she expect you to
help carry out her wishes?

977
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,598
I'll take your case.

978
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,017
Thank you, sir. Of course,
I'll pay the customary fees.

979
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,228
Oh, no. There'll be expenses you'll
have to meet, but there won't be any fee.

980
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:27,564
I'm a fool to take your case and
the only one who can win it for you

981
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,692
but if I'm gonna get into a
fight, it'll be on clean ground.

982
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,527
Come see me tomorrow.

983
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,494
But it was Miss Em who owned the
property, and she wanted this girl to have it.

984
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,246
But that isn't the point.
Doc. It's the principle.

985
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:44,581
Dr. Joe?

986
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:49,502
Come on. See ya later, Doc.

987
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,213
Be seein' ya, Doc.

988
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,634
Dr. Joe, could you help
me, help me to find a job?

989
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:59,054
I only need a few days to
help cover the court expenses

990
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,764
and I can't ask Granny.

991
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:04,351
She's been ill lately, hasn't
been able to work at all.

992
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,561
Might as well face it, Pinky.

993
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:09,064
I couldn't possibly get you a job now.

994
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:11,983
A lot of the folks even down
on my neck about this thing,

995
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,070
blamin' me for puttin' you
over there in the first place.

996
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,947
If it isn't too much, I could...

997
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:18,406
Oh, no, Doctor.

998
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,492
Thank you. I'll find a way.

999
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,788
Good-bye.

1000
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,240
Hello.

1001
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,623
Pinky?

1002
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,086
Yes, Granny?

1003
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:58,131
Tom.

1004
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:08,099
Darling, come here. Granny.

1005
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,729
Granny, this is Dr. Thomas Adams.

1006
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,108
How do you do?

1007
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,569
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1008
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,655
I reckon you got things to talk about.

1009
01:18:46,806 --> 01:18:48,306
Why on earth are you doing this?

1010
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,725
I needed some money. Granny was sick.

1011
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,103
Could've asked me for it. No, Tom.

1012
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,814
This is something I
have to do by myself.

1013
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,233
I still don't know what
it's all about, Pat,

1014
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:01,277
or why you think it's important
enough to change our plans.

1015
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:06,324
Quite a stir in the papers up
north, Negro papers in particular.

1016
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,993
Got ahold of some clippings for you.

1017
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:12,163
I read in one of 'em the
trial was set for tomorrow.

1018
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,376
Read them.

1019
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,008
"Negro Heiress Defies Lynch Law. "

1020
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:29,055
Yes, there... There was a reporter
here, but I didn't tell him anything.

1021
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:35,603
"Negro Girl Fights To Hold Her... "

1022
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,524
I had no idea they'd make so much of it.

1023
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,737
Why go through with it? What for?
It isn't too late to back out.

1024
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:46,781
The trial’s tomorrow.
Let it go by default.

1025
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:49,284
We don't need the house. I
got plenty for both of us.

1026
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,411
Be sensible. Pack, and
let's get out of here.

1027
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:52,829
I can't do that, Tom.

1028
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,875
What are you fighting for, a run-down
house and a few acres of worthless land?

1029
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,293
No.

1030
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:01,171
If I should back out now,
I'd be letting Miss Em down.

1031
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,131
I can't do that. I can't let her down.

1032
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:06,801
I can't let myself down or my people.

1033
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:09,804
They're not your people, Pat! What?

1034
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,140
Not really. There'll be no Pinky
Johnson after we're married.

1035
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,934
You'll be Mrs. Thomas Adams
for the rest of your life.

1036
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:20,523
Tom, you can change your name, but I wonder
if you can change what you really are inside.

1037
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:27,280
What's behind all this?
You haven't really told me.

1038
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:32,869
I don't know. I'm not
being heroic. I'd hate that.

1039
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,331
I just know I have to go
through with it to the end.

1040
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,625
You see, they're trying
to steal the property,

1041
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:41,419
steal it from Miss
Em as much as from me.

1042
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:44,088
They'll probably get away with it.

1043
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,842
But I'm gonna make them
do it out in the open,

1044
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:51,429
right out in court for
everyone to see and hear.

1045
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:58,269
It won't be pleasant, Tom. They'll
lie. They'll try to humiliate me.

1046
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,022
They'll try every trick of prejudice.

1047
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,565
But I just...

1048
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:14,577
All right, Pat. I'll
be there. I understand.

1049
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:32,095
We also propose to show, Your Honor,
that the defendant, Pinky Johnson

1050
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:35,848
colored, of a violent nature,

1051
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,476
quarrelsome, a troublemaker,

1052
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:42,522
that she is capable of executing
the scheme I have described to you

1053
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,984
and that she had every
opportunity of doing so.

1054
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:49,487
The deceased was unquestionably senile.

1055
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:53,241
The fact that she signed the will
twice is evidence of a confused mind.

1056
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:57,662
She was unduly influenced by the
defendant as I have outlined to you.

1057
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,623
And she was under the
influence of drugs,

1058
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,917
administered by the defendant.

1059
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:07,922
Furthermore, this will
was written at a time when

1060
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:12,176
reliable witnesses will
prove she was of unsound mind.

1061
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,387
May I see that will again, please?

1062
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:18,099
In view of these things, we therefore
ask that the will be set aside

1063
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:21,185
and the property inherited
by the next of kin.

1064
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:25,315
I yield to you, Judge Walker.

1065
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:29,902
Your Honor.

1066
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,782
I agreed to act for the
defendant in this case

1067
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:38,119
because I feared an injustice
was about to be done.

1068
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:41,706
Your Honor, apparently my
fears were well-founded.

1069
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,459
Counsel for the plaintiff
has made it perfectly clear

1070
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:48,546
that my client in effect is to
be tried because she is a Negro

1071
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:53,176
and because a Negro cannot be permitted
to inherit property in this community.

1072
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,556
That is a harsh
fact, but we must face it.

1073
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:01,476
Though many of us may
criticize this bequest,

1074
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,355
I do not believe any of us who knew Miss
Em, and most of us knew and loved her,

1075
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,733
can accept the contention
that she was insane.

1076
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,402
I do not believe counsel
for the plaintiff can prove

1077
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,072
that undue influence
was exerted by my client.

1078
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:18,951
I think most of us know how difficult it
was to influence Miss Em in any respect.

1079
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,954
We need not look too far for a
motive in making this bequest.

1080
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:25,249
She was a proud woman
who'd leave no debt unpaid.

1081
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,043
This was a real obligation.

1082
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:30,922
She took the only means open to her
of paying for my client's services,

1083
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,424
through the provisions of her will.

1084
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:37,220
The expressed wishes of the
dead should not be set aside

1085
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:40,598
to gratify the greed or
the prejudice of the living.

1086
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,603
Your Honor, this is
a small country town.

1087
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:50,692
We've always thought that what happened
here was our own private concern.

1088
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,902
This is no longer true,

1089
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,279
just as it is no longer true
that our country as a whole

1090
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,949
can exist entirely to itself.

1091
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,994
What is done in our courts
in cases such as this

1092
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,373
has become a matter of moment
in the eyes of the world.

1093
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:09,627
Let us examine our conscience. Let us
look into our attitude and our tradition.

1094
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,213
Let us take care, lest
it be said of us that here

1095
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:14,590
there is neither law nor justice.

1096
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,845
Your Honor, we're all anxious to get to
the bottom of this as quickly as possible

1097
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:22,223
before the temperature of this
room reaches the boiling point.

1098
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,767
Fortunately, there is one witness
who is qualified to testify

1099
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:27,395
on the only matters of
pertinence to this hearing,

1100
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:31,649
the question of Miss Em's sanity
and the question of undue influence.

1101
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,236
Incidentally, he will be
the defense's only witness.

1102
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,073
He was Miss Em's physician, in constant
attendance during her last illness.

1103
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:42,076
He was also her confidant,
witnessed her will,

1104
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:46,122
and is the executor of her
estate, Dr. Joseph McGill.

1105
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,584
Your Honor, I disagree with
my esteemed opponent's notions

1106
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:52,670
of what is or isn't
pertinent to this hearing.

1107
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:57,049
But I am perfectly willing to have Dr.
McGill take the stand at this point.

1108
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:59,010
Very well. Call Dr. McGill.

1109
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,094
Do you think that's...

1110
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:03,931
Oh, let him put his witness on
first. We'll close with ours.

1111
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,392
Dr. Joe doesn't seem
to be here, Your Honor.

1112
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,436
Well, take a look in the
corridor. See if he's there.

1113
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,438
He ain't out here, Your Honor.

1114
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:15,067
Well, that bein' the case we'll have to
proceed with the plaintiff's witnesses.

1115
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:17,153
Are you ready, Mr.
Stanley? Yes, Your Honor.

1116
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,988
Better find Dr. Joe and bring him here.

1117
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,198
Yes, Judge Walker.

1118
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:24,452
Money and a man, I believe,
is what caused the trouble.

1119
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,120
The usual thing.

1120
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,374
Well, we picked 'em both up, along
with the man they was fightin' over.

1121
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:33,669
Judge Walker heard the case.
That's all I know about it.

1122
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,671
Yeah, money and a man.

1123
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:39,842
Thank you. Your witness.

1124
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:46,891
Chief Anderson, what was the final
prison sentence imposed on my client?

1125
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,143
Why, Judge Walker, you
know there wasn't any.

1126
01:25:49,228 --> 01:25:50,520
So she was cleared.

1127
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,188
Is that correct?

1128
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,025
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.

1129
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,235
You wouldn't?

1130
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,447
You generally always let 'em off with
a good talkin' to, like you give her.

1131
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:04,033
You know how it is.

1132
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,577
If you put them niggers in jail
every time somethin' happens...

1133
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,037
That'll do.

1134
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,164
Your Honor, this witness's testimony

1135
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:11,958
should be ignored and
stricken from the record

1136
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,084
as totally irrelevant to the hearing.

1137
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,168
Your Honor, I object!

1138
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:18,798
Just a minute! The court is capable
of deciding any questions of relevancy.

1139
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,759
Motion denied. Call the next witness.

1140
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,886
Well, for one thing, on my last visit

1141
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:26,722
this girl simply
wouldn't leave the room.

1142
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:30,852
And I could see that Cousin Em
actually didn't dare to dismiss her.

1143
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:34,063
Then Cousin Em began to
talk about makin' a will.

1144
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:38,401
Well, I tried to cheer her up, but she turned
to this Pinky and said, "What do you think?"

1145
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:41,362
as if... As if she didn't
dare to make up her mind alone

1146
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,698
which was never like Cousin Em, never.

1147
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:44,866
What did the girl say?

1148
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,909
Oh, she spoke up, bold as you please,

1149
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:50,538
and said Cousin Em had better make
a will if she was ever goin' to.

1150
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:51,706
That's the part I mentioned to you.

1151
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,040
Impudent, yes,

1152
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,835
but the way she said it, a threat too.

1153
01:26:56,545 --> 01:27:01,340
And I'm just glad that Cousin Em was
allowed to die a natural death in her bed.

1154
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:06,220
I think everyone in this courtroom
understands what you mean, ma'am.

1155
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,516
Did you notice anything peculiar
about her condition that day?

1156
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:15,021
Oh, yes. She closed her
eyes while I was talkin'.

1157
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:19,483
She kept droppin' off in
a stupor. She was doped!

1158
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,737
And then she told me
she was subject to fits,

1159
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,740
that half the time she
was clean out of her mind.

1160
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:28,576
Poor soul. Poor soul.

1161
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,120
Thank you, Mrs. Wooley.

1162
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,663
Your witness.

1163
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:40,004
Mrs. Wooley, you have testified that
my client's tone was threatenin'.

1164
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:44,634
Now, Miss Em must've made some
sort of reply if she was threatened.

1165
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:46,260
What were Miss Em's next words?

1166
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:48,137
I don't remember. She was doped.

1167
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,681
Didn't she say Pinky's
opinion was sensible

1168
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,475
because that agreed with
what she thought herself?

1169
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:56,270
Were you there, Judge Walker, or are you
just bein' primed by that girl over there?

1170
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,064
Did you ever hear such...

1171
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:00,650
Uh, answer the question, please.

1172
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,109
Isn't that what Miss Em said?

1173
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,737
I'd certainly remember it if she had.

1174
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,615
Mrs. Wooley, do you know
the penalty for perjury?

1175
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:08,699
I object!

1176
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,952
Your Honor, I object to this
attempt to intimidate the witness!

1177
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:13,120
She's answered the question.
She doesn't remember.

1178
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,248
And now, if my opponent will stop
putting words in the mouth of the dead...

1179
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,209
No personalities, gentlemen.

1180
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,044
It's hot enough in here as it is.

1181
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,380
Will Your Honor please
rule on my objection?

1182
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,631
Objection sustained.

1183
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:24,799
Thank you!

1184
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:27,551
Didn't I tell you he's a good'n?

1185
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,682
So, Aunt Dicey, you were there in the
room when she was writing her will.

1186
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:35,810
Yes, sir. Sittin' right there,

1187
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:38,646
like I always done when my Pinky's out.

1188
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,775
And Miss Em was still writin' when
I left to take the wash uptown.

1189
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:46,570
'Cause Judge Walker and some is mighty
particular when they gets their wash.

1190
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,740
I understand, Aunt Dicey.

1191
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:53,536
You know what a hypodermic is?

1192
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,538
Yes, sir.

1193
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:59,917
Did you ever see your granddaughter
stick one of those things in Miss Em?

1194
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:02,253
Yes, sir. I see her do it twice.

1195
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:04,547
What happened?

1196
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:08,592
Miss Em talked to herself for a while.

1197
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:10,761
You mean raved?

1198
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,181
Kind of mumbled, like.

1199
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:17,435
Then she go off to sleep
like she a little baby.

1200
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,440
Now, just one more question, Aunt Dicey.

1201
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:29,071
What makes you think it was her will
that Miss Em was writing that day?

1202
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,324
I know it was, sir.

1203
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,870
Well, you see, Aunt Dicey,
this is a court of law,

1204
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,914
and you're sworn to tell
the truth before God.

1205
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:42,543
Some of us think this will may
have been written at some other time

1206
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:45,129
while your granddaughter was present.

1207
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:49,133
Did Miss Em tell you
she was writing her will?

1208
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,802
No, sir, Mr. Stanley.

1209
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:56,599
But you were sitting where you could see
the paper she was writing on, weren't you?

1210
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,602
Yes, sir, Mr. Stanley.

1211
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,148
Well, now, didn't you see
enough of it to know what it was?

1212
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:07,777
He's going to trap her. He knows she
can't read, and she'll never admit it.

1213
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:08,986
From Dr. Joe.

1214
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:12,573
Come, now, Aunt Dicey.
Let's have an answer.

1215
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,579
You know, sir, as well
as me it ain't manners

1216
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,165
readin' what ain't
meant for you to read.

1217
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,920
Then how can you swear
before God you knew it was her will?

1218
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:27,963
Now, Aunt Dicey, you
answer me the gospel truth!

1219
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:31,092
Couldn't this will have been written at
some other time? Couldn't it? Couldn't it?

1220
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:32,218
Yes...

1221
01:30:32,302 --> 01:30:34,637
Couldn't Pinky have helped Miss Em
make a will when you weren't around?

1222
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,138
I reckon she could, sir.

1223
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:37,515
Your witness!

1224
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:44,855
Your Honor, we'll waive
cross-examination of this witness.

1225
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,775
All right, Aunt Dicey.
You can step down now.

1226
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:51,445
I have here a note from Dr. Joe in
which he says he's going to be delayed.

1227
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,782
Now, on the basis of this note,
I petition for a brief recess.

1228
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:56,951
May I see this note, please?

1229
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:01,789
Do I have your permission
to read this to the court?

1230
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:03,124
You certainly have.

1231
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,793
"Sorry. Mary Picken's
baby jumped the gun.

1232
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:07,711
"When it gets here, I'll get there.

1233
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,213
"Joe McGill. "

1234
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:13,634
Seriously, Your Honor,
I object to this petition

1235
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:18,222
or to any legal strategy intended solely
to drag out this unfortunate affair

1236
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:20,391
which should have never
seen the light of day anyway.

1237
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,977
Judge Walker had as much time
as we did to summon witnesses

1238
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,854
and to make sure they'd be here!

1239
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,731
As for this note, it's easy
to read between the lines.

1240
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:30,776
Naturally, Dr. Joe didn't want to
hurt his old friend's feelings here

1241
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:34,697
with a direct refusal to appear as
a witness in this unpleasant case.

1242
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:38,742
It's obvious, however, that bountiful
nature and the ethics of his profession

1243
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,578
have come to his aid.

1244
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,832
Oh, this is going to
be a long confinement!

1245
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:50,129
He's not asking for a recess, Your
Honor. He's asking for a postponement!

1246
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:54,967
Petition denied, Judge Walker.

1247
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:56,385
Thank you, Judge Shoreham.

1248
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:03,267
Any more of that, and
I'll have the room cleared.

1249
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,519
Have you any further witnesses?

1250
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:06,604
No more, Your Honor.

1251
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,356
I agree with counsel for the plaintiff.

1252
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,859
There's no point in
dragging this out any longer.

1253
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:12,985
Thank you.

1254
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,197
The court has heard all the facts
and is ready to announce its finding.

1255
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,781
Thank you, sir.

1256
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:22,703
I do not intend to defend
the wisdom of this bequest

1257
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:27,499
nor do I intend to base my findings
on the conclusions of the witnesses,

1258
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:30,836
nor on the hearsay evidence
admitted here today.

1259
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:33,130
This will is a legal document.

1260
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:37,509
I have examined it, and I see no
reason to doubt that it was written

1261
01:32:37,594 --> 01:32:40,679
by a woman in full
possession of her faculties.

1262
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:45,768
Moreover, plaintiffs have failed to
establish that any undue influence

1263
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:48,229
was exerted by the defendant.

1264
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:51,899
The will is therefore
declared to be good and valid

1265
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:55,527
and the executor shall carry
out its terms as written.

1266
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:56,695
But Judge Shoreham!

1267
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,032
I want
it clearly understood,

1268
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,702
any attempt to interfere with
the defendant or her property

1269
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:05,996
will be answerable to this court.

1270
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,290
Court is now adjourned.

1271
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,754
Quiet! Quiet, please!

1272
01:33:20,387 --> 01:33:23,389
Judge Walker, I don't
know how to thank you.

1273
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:29,144
Well, Pinky, you won. You
got the house and the land.

1274
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,355
And you got justice.

1275
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:35,359
But I doubt if any other interests
of this community have been served.

1276
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:18,986
Come on, darling. Let's go.

1277
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,907
All right, Tom. All right.

1278
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,437
Big old houses like this
are a drug on the market.

1279
01:35:35,522 --> 01:35:38,649
We'll find a good real estate
man and turn it over to him.

1280
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:44,238
We'll auction off the furniture
and the silver separately.

1281
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:47,408
You know, some of those pieces
down there look valuable.

1282
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,413
We'll sell them all in your
name, so you'll be independent,

1283
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,666
just in case you decide
to run away from me again.

1284
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:25,904
This is quite a room.

1285
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,033
Yes.

1286
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,748
Oh, say, isn't this a
beautiful fire screen?

1287
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:41,128
Miss Em was proud of that. Martha Washington
is supposed to have done the embroidery.

1288
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:43,630
Oh, we can't let this get away from us.

1289
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:45,883
We'll have it sent out to Denver.

1290
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,718
Denver?

1291
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,640
Didn't I tell you? I...

1292
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:57,394
I've accepted a position
in a clinic there.

1293
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,064
But all your ties are in Boston,

1294
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,524
your family.

1295
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,196
Oh. But the...

1296
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,034
The publicity.

1297
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:13,327
Oh, it's partly that,

1298
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,704
but I've always thought
about moving out west.

1299
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:19,416
Besides, too many people in Boston
know, or they might find out.

1300
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:24,922
Pat, you'll love it in Denver. Some
friends of mine are starting this clinic.

1301
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,299
They want me to go in with them.

1302
01:37:33,348 --> 01:37:37,267
I can't sell the house, Tom. That
isn't why she left it to me, to sell,

1303
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:40,020
or why I went through with the trial.

1304
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,357
She said, with confidence in the
use to which I'd put the property.

1305
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,859
Let's be practical. Her lawyer had
it straight when he said she was

1306
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:48,028
merely, merely trying to
pay off her debt to you.

1307
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:50,197
Now, if you'll let me...
No, that wasn't her reason.

1308
01:37:50,281 --> 01:37:52,950
She'd have left it to
Granny. She owed her far more.

1309
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:55,536
Miss Em accepted service as her due.

1310
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:59,581
No, she had some purpose,
something she wanted me to do.

1311
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:02,876
Come on now, Pat. I know she was
a wonderful old woman and all that,

1312
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:06,046
and she made a deep impression
on you, but she's dead.

1313
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,674
Your own life is much more important
than her purpose, if she had one.

1314
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:10,717
It's my life she was thinking of.

1315
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:13,512
She told me once to be
myself wherever I was.

1316
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,139
Well, that's pretty good advice,
but... But you said yesterday,

1317
01:38:16,224 --> 01:38:19,434
there'd be no Pinky Johnson
after we were married.

1318
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:23,272
How can I be myself?

1319
01:38:23,356 --> 01:38:24,606
It was only a figure of speech.

1320
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:28,151
Now, let's get out of this place. You're
letting the trial get under your skin.

1321
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:29,278
Will you forget it?

1322
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,071
You mean run away from it, Tom.

1323
01:38:31,155 --> 01:38:34,741
This time to Denver, running
away for the rest of our lives.

1324
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:35,867
You're all confused.

1325
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:37,536
No. I'm just beginning to understand.

1326
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,914
She didn't want me to go. She didn't
want me to pretend. We talked about it.

1327
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,708
Pat... That's why she wrote the will.

1328
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,668
She thought the house
would keep me here.

1329
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:46,086
But she was wrong.

1330
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,754
That's why she wrote it.

1331
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,423
She was wrong, wasn't she?

1332
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:50,841
Wasn't she?

1333
01:38:58,725 --> 01:39:00,559
I can't go with you.

1334
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:05,022
I'm sick of lying, Tom. We
wouldn't be happy, either of us.

1335
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:10,402
What do you expect to do, crawl into a
closet and live there the rest of your life?

1336
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:13,113
Close the door and lock
it, lock everything?

1337
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,948
Pat, look at me. Look at me!

1338
01:39:15,033 --> 01:39:17,784
Will you come to your senses? You've
got to make a break, get away from it!

1339
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,746
I don't want to get away from anything.

1340
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:23,957
I'm a Negro. I can't forget
it, and I can't deny it.

1341
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:28,378
I can't pretend to be anything else,
and I don't want to be anything else.

1342
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:30,839
Don't you see, Tom?

1343
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:33,008
No, I don't.

1344
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,511
You can't live without pride.

1345
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,685
I'm sorry, Tom.

1346
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:47,314
I'll never forget you
or what you tried to do.

1347
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,902
But please go now. Don't say anything.

1348
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,029
Just go.

1349
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:28,146
What did you mean, Miss Em?

1350
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,148
Tell me.

1351
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,612
Come here a minute.

1352
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:40,534
I'm sure you will.

1353
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,744
Miss Pinky, you have to do
something about Aunt Dicey.

1354
01:40:42,829 --> 01:40:43,954
What is it this time?

1355
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,081
She's been at that new sterilizer again.

1356
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:50,127
Every time I sterilize the sheets, she
puts 'em back. Says they ain't white enough.

1357
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:53,046
I'll speak to her about it, but
I doubt if it'll do much good.

1358
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:54,131
Lunch is laid out.

1359
01:40:54,215 --> 01:40:55,757
All right. I'll get them in.

1360
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:57,426
Good morning, Miss Pinky. Hello, Teejoe.

1361
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:59,511
Teejoe is gonna do a little
flying. That right, Teejoe?

1362
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:00,721
Yes, Dr. Canady.

1363
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:02,347
Well, Pinky. Hello, Dr. Joe.

1364
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:03,849
Mornin', Doctor. Mornin', Doctor.

1365
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:06,268
Uh, thought I'd look
in on the Freeman boy.

1366
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:07,728
He's in the dining room.

1367
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:53,064
