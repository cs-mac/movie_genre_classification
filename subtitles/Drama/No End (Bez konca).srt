1
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,617
No End

2
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,051
This call is monitored

3
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,855
The time is 7.12 a.m.

4
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,175
I died...

5
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:33,459
...four days ago

6
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,335
I got the car out, as usual

7
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:42,175
I waited in it for Ula and Jacek

8
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,694
The engine ticked over.
The radio forecast a low

9
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:51,420
I felt a stab of fear.
My heart, I thought

10
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:57,221
But the pain never came.
All I felt was fear

11
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,411
I took a deep breath

12
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,061
And that was that

13
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:12,419
I wondered if the meIons on the
baIcony wouId ever sprout

14
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:17,458
By now UIa had emerged with Jacek

15
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,978
She waIked towards the car
but I moved away

16
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:25,973
I saw her having troubIe
with the car door

17
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:29,454
But it was Iike Iooking down

18
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,300
That seemed strange

19
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:35,494
After aII, I was sitting
at the wheeI

20
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:40,735
I feIt good. Everything
was so peacefuI...

21
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,454
...and quiet

22
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,822
Though UIa seemed to be shouting

23
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:53,377
I didn't feeI dizzy after
my first cigarette

24
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,254
I couIdn't feeI the keys
in my pocket

25
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:04,973
It struck me I couId come back
to myseIf if I wanted to...

26
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:08,651
...and drive Jacek to schooI

27
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,413
But I feIt better as I was,
much better

28
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,334
I watched the coffin being cIosed

29
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:24,774
It was then that Jacek understood,
because he began to cry

30
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,413
His hands were frozen

31
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:33,057
But he was ashamed to put them
in his pockets

32
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:38,141
I went back home.
It was stiII empty

33
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,372
Darek's dossier was Iying
on the desk

34
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,380
I wished I couId be with him
in court

35
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:54,538
I onIy saw UIa and Jacek
after they got back

36
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,733
They feII asIeep together
on his bed

37
00:05:59,221 --> 00:06:01,610
He cIung to her for a Iong time

38
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:07,141
She woke up in the night and
moved to her own bed

39
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:18,696
Ula? Tomek here

40
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,494
-l'm in Warsaw, just landed
- Where?

41
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:26,694
At Okecie. l hope l'm in time
to catch the Counsellor

42
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:31,531
- He's not here
-At 7.30? You two split up?

43
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,571
ls that the alarm?
How's that for timing?

44
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,454
Antek is dead

45
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:43,699
The funeraI was yesterday.
CaII me Iater

46
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,978
- Don't taIk about it at schooI
- I won't

47
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,620
I'II come straight home

48
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:04,930
You'II be here, won't you?
We'II see each other

49
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,576
ls that Mrs Zyro?

50
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,653
l have to see you,
about my husband

51
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,573
Hello? l said l need to see you

52
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:49,734
- Who are you?
-l'm Darek's wife

53
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:54,860
Your husband was his lawyer.
You must know that

54
00:08:55,621 --> 00:09:00,217
lt's a political case.
l must see you

55
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,139
CaII the office

56
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:07,501
I'm not a Iawyer. I'm sending them
aII the fiIes

57
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:09,453
That's the point

58
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:13,620
It's about Thursday's bioIogy.
You asked me to...

59
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,817
The Iine is crossed. HeIIo?

60
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:19,490
You must have Darek's file.
Hello?

61
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:06,936
Waiting for me?

62
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:11,534
I caIIed this morning.
Wake up, SyIwia

63
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:19,461
- I took some miIk
- AII right, come in

64
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,254
How can I heIp you?

65
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:27,293
- As I said, I need that fiIe
- What fiIe?

66
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:30,333
My husband's case

67
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,813
I can't give it to you

68
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:40,331
Why won't you heIp me?

69
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,014
It beIongs to the new Iawyer

70
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:48,611
Those are the ruIes.
Don't you know?

71
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:52,615
FiIes get Iost. No one knows how

72
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,251
But you don't care

73
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,461
Come on, SyIwia

74
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:11,332
Madam, you said it was
a poIiticaI case

75
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,855
That's right

76
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,460
I shouIdn't, but if the fiIe
is here...

77
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,538
...I'II Iet you see it

78
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:25,778
Is she thirsty? Bored?

79
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:29,980
No, she Iikes Iistening
to grown-ups' taIk

80
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,452
- Nothing here
- ShouId there be?

81
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:37,019
I wouIdn't know. No, nothing

82
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:43,453
- What did he do?
- A strike. He organised a strike

83
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,418
Who'II take the case now?

84
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:52,500
Maybe someone Iike your husband?

85
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,818
I can't think of anyone.
Wait, though...

86
00:12:56,182 --> 00:13:00,379
There's this oId Iawyer
Antek trained under

87
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,220
- OId?
- Yes

88
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,931
He was at the funeraI.
His name is Labrador

89
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:14,937
Maybe he's stiII in the
Iawyers' directory

90
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:35,174
Go to Dept.4. They'II teII you

91
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:40,820
I'd Iike to know who the judge is.
'Bye, thank you

92
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:46,490
Sorry to keep you.
How can I heIp you?

93
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:52,890
Mrs Zyro toId me you've rescued Iots
of peopIe. That you couId heIp me

94
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:57,220
Those were different cases

95
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:03,899
My Iast poIiticaI case was
in 1952

96
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:06,539
He got death

97
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,211
After that, I quit

98
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,618
Now I do petty crime

99
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:19,654
That woman won't be testifying.
She's stiII abroad

100
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,979
TeII our cIient to remain siIent

101
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:26,139
Take a taxi. I'II pay you back

102
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:32,297
SmuggIing offences.
I'm strong on those

103
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,778
I steer cIear of poIitics

104
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:38,376
Have you heard of this case?

105
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,451
A hot potato, Iike aII of them

106
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:46,130
You're making an oId man
face a hard choice

107
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:47,974
Not me, the times

108
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,820
I'm quite aware of
the present time

109
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:55,731
But what to do about it?

110
00:14:58,782 --> 00:15:00,340
Got the time?

111
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,379
A quarter past one

112
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:09,618
Damn it, my watch!

113
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,138
It's stopped. Know how I got it?

114
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:31,850
A present from Antek when
he was caIIed to the bar

115
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,457
Let me sIeep on this

116
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,692
CaII me tomorrow

117
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,460
- Heard the news?
- What news?

118
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:07,019
They've done it. The scrap-heap
at 70

119
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:09,698
It's gone through?

120
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,142
It wiII. You can bet on it

121
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,899
We're finished

122
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,217
What can we do?

123
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:39,929
Guess what? We've been given
our marching orders

124
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,613
Come January and we're out!

125
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,616
So I've heard

126
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,698
But this charade... how
about that for an ending?

127
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,216
A kind of swan song

128
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:19,450
PeopIe sometimes go crazy,
madam

129
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:23,339
You needn't caII me

130
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:28,974
I'II take the case. Are you
free tomorrow at 4?

131
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,212
Who are you caIIing, mum?

132
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:44,221
No one. I was going to,
but I forgot who

133
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:47,655
- Looking for something?
- No

134
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:53,740
Just sorting things out

135
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,817
A man caIIed earIier

136
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:00,854
Funny name. GibraItar...

137
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,694
That's right. He asked
about some fiIe

138
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:10,140
I know. I'II turn out your Iight
when I go to bed

139
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:15,656
- Jacek? Good night
- Good night, mum

140
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:23,175
Antek!

141
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:07,218
He was in the car, waiting.
I'd been on the phone

142
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:12,931
Maybe if I hadn't been Iate

143
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:18,220
- A heart is a heart
- But it can't be a coincidence

144
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:22,300
- You couIdn't have heIped
- I'd have been there

145
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,134
Don't think about it

146
00:22:25,382 --> 00:22:27,337
What can I think about?

147
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:33,339
You're stiII young. You've a nice kid.
You're a good transIator

148
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:37,941
UIka, you and Antek weren't
very cIose IateIy

149
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:42,898
That's true. But now it seems
we were

150
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,253
Does that make sense?

151
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,733
He's gone

152
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:53,451
Tomek... ten years ago
you were cIose friends

153
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,894
Later, too

154
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:59,013
I know, but when we first met...

155
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:05,539
Did you know about certain
photographs of me?

156
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:07,617
In the nude? He toId me

157
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,778
- Showed you?
- Of course not

158
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:14,420
- How did he find out?
- A ''weII-wisher'' sent them

159
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:23,253
I found them yesterday.
He'd cut out my face

160
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:28,460
He knew I'd been a guide,
and hard up for money

161
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:31,130
I couId have expIained

162
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,211
Why didn't he say anything?

163
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:39,211
Why did he cut out my face?

164
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:44,731
- Did he have many such cases?
- RecentIy, yes

165
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:58,855
- What's this?
- A note

166
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:04,453
That's what his wife must
have been Iooking for

167
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:07,460
''I'm gIad you're defending me

168
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:12,701
''You're young and you understand.
The first in a month

169
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:17,134
''You're right about having
to return to society...

170
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:19,537
''...but with honour

171
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,175
''I'II do as you say

172
00:24:22,301 --> 00:24:26,260
''No poIitics. But I'II admit
to being a strike Ieader

173
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:31,211
''They trusted me though I
hadn't been in SoIidarity

174
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:37,133
''I wanted to settIe grievances,
not to wreck the machinery

175
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:40,214
''I'm worried about my famiIy

176
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:44,300
''TeII Joanna not to take
SyIwia to dad

177
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:49,371
''Best wishes from me and
my ceIImates. Darek

178
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:53,369
''I'm gIad you don't want me
to act insane''

179
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:55,413
Who'II take this?

180
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:03,573
I've been away too Iong.
Otherwise I might myseIf

181
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:10,734
- I put her on to Labrador
- He won't take it

182
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:12,621
He aIready has

183
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,619
What's this?

184
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:23,654
The question mark. Is it yours?

185
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:25,539
By Labrador's name

186
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:46,692
You poked around in daddy's things

187
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:50,621
- No. When?
- Yesterday

188
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,457
You scrawIed something...

189
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:58,217
...with a feIt-tip. Don't Iie!

190
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,970
You're Iying

191
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:06,057
You know I'm not Iying

192
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:12,733
I'm going to Praga.
Want to come?

193
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:16,934
No. Give me the keys.
I'II stay at home

194
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:19,858
Wait a second

195
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:28,050
It's Antek's wife

196
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,740
- What did they take?
- Guess!

197
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:37,059
Contraband books. You had some
Iying around

198
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,700
Yes, I was reading Brandys

199
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,451
- Notebooks?
- Yes

200
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:47,334
Any cassettes?

201
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:51,614
They took them aII. PIus
a typewriter, Ietters...

202
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:55,941
- From Maciek
- Did you have any notes?

203
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:58,938
Some EngIish notes

204
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,260
I bet you didn't get a receipt

205
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:07,259
- I was too scared to ask
- Show me

206
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:14,419
''I hereby request the return...

207
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:18,337
''...of the property confiscated
in the search...''

208
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,655
Search?

209
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:23,372
Requisition. They hate
the word 'search'

210
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:27,939
And 'request'? What are
you requesting? Right?

211
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,853
- Won't it be impoIite?
- Why shouIdn't it be?

212
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:35,377
Give me some paper. I'II do it

213
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:45,851
- What's happened?
- I... my car broke down

214
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:49,932
Remember this? I showed it to you

215
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:53,218
The Iist of Iawyers

216
00:30:53,902 --> 00:30:56,973
- It wasn't torn then
- What eIse?

217
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:01,491
- That wasn't there
- Of course it wasn't

218
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,211
Maybe the boy...

219
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:09,211
- It couIdn't have been him
- Then who?

220
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:19,053
It's Antek warning me off
Labrador

221
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:25,053
So what now? No, that's stupid

222
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:28,536
I must go. I may not get a taxi

223
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:31,460
- I'II go with you
- I can drop you, sir

224
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,375
- I have a car
- No one says ''sir'' here

225
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:39,732
The Institute. Is that OK?
I'II get ready

226
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,173
What Institute?

227
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:47,500
For cancer research.
Radiotherapy

228
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:53,529
You Iooked through that fiIe

229
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,051
I didn't know you. I was afraid

230
00:31:56,902 --> 00:32:00,736
There was a message.
Something about...

231
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:05,055
...not taking the chiId to see dad.
I don't get it

232
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:07,934
I do

233
00:32:08,182 --> 00:32:11,333
What shaII I teII Darek?
I'm due back soon

234
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:16,012
AII you know. But remember,
everything here is fine

235
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,494
No probIems

236
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:30,300
BIackbeard!

237
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:33,931
For you

238
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,131
Thanks

239
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,009
- Drop by sometime
- I wiII

240
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:49,097
''I'm worried about my famiIy

241
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:53,211
''TeII Joanna not to take SyIwia...''

242
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:56,140
You'II ruin your eyesight

243
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:05,299
Zyro did a good job on
our cIient, didn't he?

244
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:06,695
Go away

245
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:12,298
Like some tea? At this
time of day, it's...

246
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:33,214
Today? What time?

247
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:35,297
Shit!

248
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:41,375
I'II be there

249
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:47,780
Run aIong

250
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,938
Make sure the door is shut

251
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:21,135
Maybe you know what you want?
To make things better?

252
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:24,572
Fairer, right?

253
00:34:25,422 --> 00:34:26,855
But where?

254
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:34,931
- In PoIand
- Which PoIand?

255
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:40,697
You don't want to taIk to me?

256
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:45,936
Am I being too bIunt with you?

257
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:50,695
WeII then, which PoIand?

258
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:56,570
- Ours. There is no other
- ExactIy

259
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:59,134
SociaIist PoIand?

260
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,460
Can you imagine a different
PoIand?

261
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:07,614
- Not reaIIy
- There you are, then

262
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:12,699
The onIy PoIand you want to make
better is a SociaIist PoIand

263
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:15,382
And that's what you have to say

264
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:19,538
Never mind what you think

265
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:22,059
You're pending triaI

266
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:26,260
Ever been in a courtroom?
Judges are a fixture

267
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:28,452
They respect their job

268
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:33,610
They may be tired, but they're
weII aware history is Iike a wheeI

269
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:36,289
Let's give them a chance

270
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:42,574
- Know what that means?
- Yes. A seII-out

271
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:48,972
There's aIways some Ieeway between
seIIing out and compromising, son

272
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:54,260
There is. But you have to find it

273
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:57,570
The evidence against you is thin

274
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:02,851
They're onIy interested in Ieaders.
Don't make it seem...

275
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:05,012
...the strike was your idea

276
00:36:05,141 --> 00:36:09,818
- It was everyone's idea
- Sure, but it won't Iook that way

277
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:13,536
But I was eIected. I had the Iist

278
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:15,936
Suit yourseIf

279
00:36:19,382 --> 00:36:22,657
There's no evidence, no
committee, no Ieader

280
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:25,257
- Is that right?
- Right

281
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,735
Not quite, but near enough

282
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:32,371
I toId you, there's aIways
some Ieeway

283
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:38,657
Now, have you ever been
to a demonstration?

284
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:41,496
Once

285
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:45,012
Why onIy once? I'II teII you why

286
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:51,697
The opposition were wearing the
same uniform you wore in the army

287
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:55,454
You wanted to take part,
but couIdn't

288
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,538
Psychiatrists caII that...

289
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,739
Zyro was against pIeading
insanity

290
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:07,222
He was a wonderfuI man, Antek

291
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:12,181
But I'm 40 years oIder,
and I can't do it his way

292
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:16,135
Maybe I'm past it, or Iess gifted

293
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:21,335
He was my pupiI. ProbabIy
better than me

294
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:26,530
He was, you might say,
an artist

295
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:30,538
His way shouIdn't have worked,
but it did

296
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:36,130
My way is to take a scaIpeI
and hack

297
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,460
You two must have hit it off

298
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:45,181
Pretty weII

299
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:48,856
Evidence was beneath him

300
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,177
So were poIitics

301
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:55,938
He'd appeaI to peopIe's consciences,
even their emotions

302
00:37:57,262 --> 00:38:01,050
But I can't take chances.
I've onIy one objective

303
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,371
To get you out of here

304
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:07,652
Is there anything you need?

305
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,699
We're thinking of a hunger strike

306
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,255
What for?

307
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,650
Whose hands do you think
you'II be pIaying into?

308
00:38:31,782 --> 00:38:34,170
Got any better suggestions?

309
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:39,576
No, I've never been any good
at these things

310
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,219
Forgive me, but it's warmer
in here

311
00:38:55,902 --> 00:38:58,097
I had a cake but I ate it

312
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:01,855
No coffee either. Tea?

313
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:05,932
No, thank you. What's this?

314
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,530
Antek's notes on that kid's case

315
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,338
Can you decipher them?

316
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,454
The odd word

317
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:22,373
''The Iaw demands...

318
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:29,534
''The Iaw demands too much
of peopIe today

319
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,976
''It kiIIs what is...

320
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:40,617
''It kiIIs what is most precious
in human reIationships''

321
00:39:40,822 --> 00:39:42,777
This is underIined

322
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:48,851
''If the Iaw is against IoyaIty
and trust, then it is immoraI

323
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:57,451
''No government shouId be...

324
00:39:59,902 --> 00:40:04,577
''...shouId be interested in ruIing
over a divided nation''

325
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,130
Is it a question or
an excIamation mark?

326
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,858
I never couId read his writing

327
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:16,980
He wouIdn't want me...

328
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:20,331
...to take this case

329
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:23,652
He wanted that boy to go free

330
00:40:28,782 --> 00:40:30,579
Do you miss him?

331
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:36,614
Very much. I miss him very much

332
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:00,260
What's that?

333
00:41:00,382 --> 00:41:03,021
''It's coming. It's going to erupt...''

334
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:08,778
- Want some?
- No, thanks. We're Iistening

335
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,177
I took the parceI yesterday

336
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,458
- It's awfuI there
- Poor oId granny

337
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:26,849
First she wouIdn't Iet me in.
Then she cried

338
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:30,619
Did that girI get her things back?

339
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:35,300
- Have you got your things back?
- Not yet

340
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:41,771
She took in one of the bIokes.
Hence the search

341
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,978
But they missed him

342
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:48,572
Antek put someone up once
who was out after curfew

343
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:52,452
He hid him from me.
Later he was afraid

344
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:54,657
- What of?
- I don't know

345
00:41:54,742 --> 00:41:58,336
Someone's asking for you.
He won't come in

346
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,213
Meet each other

347
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:03,777
- Marta Duraj
- UrszuIa Zyro

348
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:09,856
Are you reIated to the Iawyer
Antoni Zyro?

349
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:13,769
Antek? I'm his wife

350
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:16,378
I knew him years ago

351
00:42:17,581 --> 00:42:18,697
How is he?

352
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:22,449
He died...

353
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,574
...a month ago

354
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:32,572
- Cigarette?
- Thanks

355
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:37,380
You knew him?

356
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:41,097
When he was a student.

357
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,737
He came round one night

358
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:49,018
A girI and I were sharing
a cabin by the beach

359
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:51,974
We'd gone to bed

360
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:58,380
He'd been swimming and
his tent had been stoIen

361
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,936
He was stiII dripping

362
00:43:03,501 --> 00:43:06,016
He sat on the bed, soaking wet

363
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:13,574
Afterwards... he stood there...

364
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:17,940
- Scrawny, bandy-Iegged
- He wasn't bandy-Iegged

365
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:20,570
- He was then
- Then what?

366
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,932
He wanted to be a judge.
He was into Camus

367
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:32,378
The penitent judge...

368
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:35,655
I read it Iater. Was he a judge?

369
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:40,657
No, a Iawyer. That's what
he aIways wanted to be

370
00:43:41,581 --> 00:43:43,617
Remember anything eIse?

371
00:43:44,782 --> 00:43:47,659
- I don't think so
- Anything at aII?

372
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:51,137
He Ieft soon after,
to do a course

373
00:43:51,382 --> 00:43:54,454
That was that. Were you
married Iong?

374
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:57,860
11 years

375
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:03,052
A Iong time. Was it a heart attack?

376
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:07,610
Yes. How did you know?

377
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:13,702
He mentioned his heart
at the time

378
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:20,614
Everything OK?

379
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:23,018
Everything's fine

380
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,418
They're on hunger strike

381
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:43,090
Labrador said Antek
was his own man

382
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:47,012
We'd aII Iike to be

383
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,697
But Antek reaIIy was

384
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:52,257
No one toId him what to do

385
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:57,302
He wrote things were
getting harder

386
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:01,978
But his Ietters were marked
'Censored'. What's this?

387
00:46:02,981 --> 00:46:07,931
A photograph. I've just found it.
Ring a beII?

388
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,934
Summer of '67

389
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:17,010
How skinny he was!

390
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,458
Who are the girIs?

391
00:46:21,581 --> 00:46:23,458
I've forgotten

392
00:46:23,702 --> 00:46:25,657
He fancied this one

393
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:30,771
- Brunette? Named Marta?
- No, bIonde and thin

394
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:34,860
Rather Iike you

395
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:38,815
We aIways feII for the same girIs

396
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,175
IncIuding you

397
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,777
I'm stiII carrying the torch

398
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:49,775
UIa, I want you to know that...

399
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:55,538
What are you Iooking at?

400
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:59,297
His hands are Iike Antek's

401
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:07,378
- You didn't hear. I said...
- Don't say it

402
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:13,213
Forget I said it, then

403
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,340
Oh, my God!

404
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:38,733
That's my car!

405
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:43,295
Rush round to the pound.
Got money?

406
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,016
Yes. WiII you wait?

407
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:49,373
No, I'II get the bus.
Off you go!

408
00:51:18,902 --> 00:51:21,369
My husband died 36 days ago

409
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:26,179
There one moment... gone the next

410
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:42,315
I assumed I loved him,
on and off at any rate

411
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:45,154
The house, my work...

412
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:48,276
I had everything

413
00:51:49,598 --> 00:51:51,554
But I didn't reaIise

414
00:51:54,038 --> 00:51:57,997
I can hardIy beIieve there were
bad times, that I hated him

415
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:03,629
It's onIy now I reaIise I was happy.
I can't accept it

416
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,277
I can't

417
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,908
I keep seeing him.
I can't forget him

418
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:28,032
You seemed to have hands Iike him

419
00:52:38,918 --> 00:52:43,150
You wouIdn't understand.
It's my probIem

420
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:52,796
Sit down a moment

421
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:29,437
Goodbye

422
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:17,189
I've bought a pair of trainers
for SyIwia

423
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:21,071
They were avaiIabIe

424
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,757
Who was he?

425
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:29,837
My father

426
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,598
Daddy!

427
00:55:34,158 --> 00:55:38,471
- Where's SyIwia?
- With a neighbour

428
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:43,754
I can't take it any more

429
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:50,194
Darek on one side,
my father on the other

430
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:57,157
He brings me newspapers,
with articIes exposing them

431
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,792
PeopIe Iike Darek and me

432
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:04,272
I can't go on

433
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:08,712
Fuck the Iot of them!

434
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:15,468
I'm scared, UIa

435
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:17,107
What of?

436
00:56:21,118 --> 00:56:25,794
Some of them go abroad.
Others die

437
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,471
But Darek...

438
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:32,511
He'II go to jaiI

439
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,589
- And I'II be on my own
- Who has died?

440
00:56:38,678 --> 00:56:39,997
BIackbeard

441
00:56:40,238 --> 00:56:41,671
Two days ago

442
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:49,906
I've transIated the OrweII.
He wanted to read it

443
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,674
You don't care, do you?

444
00:57:00,438 --> 00:57:04,795
You see aII these tragedies,
but onIy yours matters

445
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:10,993
Yes, you're right

446
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:16,708
Yesterday I did something bad

447
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:20,989
Very bad. I was unfaithfuI
to Antek

448
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,076
But he's dead

449
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:29,996
I don't know why I did that to him,
when I can stiII feeI his touch

450
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:35,594
I wish I couId heIp. I have
this address, at JeIonki

451
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:42,355
It's this young feIIow.
He heIped Marta

452
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:44,710
You met her here

453
00:57:44,918 --> 00:57:48,911
She was terribIy hung up,
and it did her good

454
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:52,351
- Want to try?
- What?

455
00:57:53,879 --> 00:57:55,357
To forget

456
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:59,194
That's bad news

457
00:58:00,118 --> 00:58:02,996
I want him to get out,
not to starve

458
00:58:03,118 --> 00:58:06,156
You'd better teII him
to start eating

459
00:58:06,279 --> 00:58:10,669
To take some soup at dinner,
and to be the first

460
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,915
I'II arrange a visit

461
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:18,917
I can go, but not to teII him that

462
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,187
Why not?

463
00:58:23,198 --> 00:58:24,837
He'd kiII me

464
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,350
Do you want him free?

465
00:58:29,518 --> 00:58:34,308
But I won't teII him that.
I'm his wife, can't you see?

466
00:58:36,718 --> 00:58:39,596
Do you think it'II get to anyone?

467
00:58:39,718 --> 00:58:42,755
CertainIy not to those
that matter

468
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,197
Human torches, but no water...

469
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:48,156
We've been there

470
00:58:48,279 --> 00:58:51,554
Don't be stubborn.
This wiII harm him

471
00:58:54,718 --> 00:58:59,712
OK, I'II teII him. And you can
go on pIaying the siIent wife

472
00:59:08,398 --> 00:59:11,196
Someone toId me to show you this

473
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:14,078
Who?

474
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:17,793
They've formed a new union
at the factory

475
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:33,674
- Do you know these peopIe?
- One of them. A friend of Darek's

476
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,988
They grew up together

477
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:39,067
Can you spare me a moment?

478
00:59:44,518 --> 00:59:50,435
A cIient of mine's been hit with a
tax cIaim. He bought a car abroad

479
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:54,710
What do you mean, bought?
A cIient of yours?

480
00:59:54,918 --> 00:59:57,194
It was a gift. That's tax-free

481
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,955
I'm onIy a trainee. But
I know how you feeI

482
01:00:05,078 --> 01:00:07,069
Is there any way I can heIp?

483
01:00:07,598 --> 01:00:10,795
How are you off for money?

484
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,308
I forgot that's why I came.
I've brought your money

485
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:21,074
Keep it. I onIy wondered
how you were managing

486
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:23,792
We couId fix something

487
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:28,157
Thank you, I'm aII right.
Better than before

488
01:00:29,198 --> 01:00:32,953
CouId you Iend me the paper?
Give it to me?

489
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:47,830
HeIIo, Judge

490
01:00:50,879 --> 01:00:54,109
We'II soon be meeting
professionaIIy

491
01:00:54,238 --> 01:00:58,277
- That's right. How do you know?
- I was toId

492
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,546
But first I have some business
with you

493
01:01:03,198 --> 01:01:04,598
Not much

494
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,754
AIways at your service

495
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:11,190
If you're interested, I'm hearing
a fascinating case

496
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:17,354
Here's what you'II do

497
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:22,917
Go to that factory and ask
that feIIow if the new union...

498
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:29,029
...wouId be prepared to show they
care about workers, even strikers...

499
01:01:29,158 --> 01:01:31,308
...by standing baiI for Darek

500
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,589
- Do you have a name?
- Of course

501
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:36,308
Damn it! Where's that paper?

502
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:39,917
It was here a minute ago

503
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,631
It can't have vanished

504
01:01:46,038 --> 01:01:50,429
- Buy another one
- Newspapers now cost 5 zIotys

505
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:52,754
- Even the Party's?
- AII of them

506
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:00,074
Lie down, Iie down

507
01:02:06,478 --> 01:02:09,197
I haven't done this before

508
01:02:10,158 --> 01:02:12,194
But it is possibIe

509
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:22,031
- Is this man aIive?
- Yes

510
01:02:22,398 --> 01:02:24,788
But he can't be with you?

511
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:30,554
- And he never wiII?
- Never

512
01:02:31,158 --> 01:02:32,511
Good

513
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:37,995
I shaII now put you to sIeep...

514
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:41,793
...and try to erase him
from your memory

515
01:02:41,998 --> 01:02:43,830
PIease, Iie down

516
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:47,629
FIat, reIaxed...

517
01:02:48,759 --> 01:02:50,714
...eyes open

518
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:56,116
Now Iook at me, and Iet
your whoIe body go Iimp

519
01:02:56,238 --> 01:03:00,197
Legs, arms, stomach, face...

520
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:03,196
Every muscIe reIaxed

521
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:07,277
Now Iower your eyeIids,
gentIy cIose your eyes

522
01:03:07,398 --> 01:03:12,473
You feeI Iight, your muscIes are
reIaxed, your eyeIids refuse to open

523
01:03:12,598 --> 01:03:16,352
Now raise your arm. It's Iight...

524
01:03:16,558 --> 01:03:20,517
It takes no effort.
You're asIeep

525
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:25,712
Now Iower your arm

526
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:27,272
GentIy

527
01:03:27,478 --> 01:03:31,676
You can't feeI your arms, your Iegs,
or any part of your body

528
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:34,352
Your mind is bIank

529
01:03:34,558 --> 01:03:36,674
No Ionger thinking of him

530
01:03:36,918 --> 01:03:41,708
AIive or dead, he's gone,
no Ionger there

531
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,756
You won't want to be with him...

532
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:48,631
...see him or taIk to him

533
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:51,428
You don't want to be with him

534
01:03:51,558 --> 01:03:55,949
When you wake, you wiII have
forgotten his voice, his face...

535
01:03:56,759 --> 01:04:00,717
You won't want to think about him

536
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:01,875
Now I'II wake you

537
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:06,756
You're beginning to feeI
your body

538
01:05:07,518 --> 01:05:09,395
To feeI heavy

539
01:05:10,279 --> 01:05:11,837
You're waking

540
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,388
When I count to zero,
you'II wake

541
01:05:19,438 --> 01:05:22,794
Five... four... three...

542
01:05:23,038 --> 01:05:26,270
...two... one... zero

543
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:30,431
You've woken

544
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:13,712
We may have to repeat this.
PIease, come again

545
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:37,477
Do you feeI aII right?
A gIass of water?

546
01:06:51,718 --> 01:06:53,038
Did it heIp?

547
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:57,674
Yes

548
01:07:52,078 --> 01:07:53,431
Mummy!

549
01:08:00,638 --> 01:08:02,788
What happened, Jacek?

550
01:08:03,759 --> 01:08:05,511
Had a bad dream?

551
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:07,991
A nightmare?

552
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,915
Come on, teII mummy

553
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,676
- Don't you want to teII me?
- I do

554
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:24,992
You and daddy

555
01:08:27,599 --> 01:08:28,952
That's nice

556
01:08:29,318 --> 01:08:31,354
I've never toId you this

557
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:35,594
I woke up one night

558
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:40,916
The Iight was on in your bedroom

559
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:47,107
Daddy was on top of you.
You were both naked

560
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:51,912
That's what I dreamt now

561
01:08:53,438 --> 01:08:55,269
What were you doing?

562
01:08:59,879 --> 01:09:01,516
Making Iove

563
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:05,357
Yes, Iove

564
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:10,677
You were born because
daddy used to cuddIe me

565
01:09:13,398 --> 01:09:17,027
Now you Iove me.
You're cuddIing me

566
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,836
HeIIo, CounseIIor

567
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,027
- Are you with someone? The coffee
- It's for you

568
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:39,394
I thought you'd be more
responsive

569
01:09:40,879 --> 01:09:44,791
Suppose I spring a IittIe
surprise on you

570
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:46,670
Like baiI for Darek...

571
01:09:46,918 --> 01:09:50,706
...from the new, IegaI,
respectabIe union

572
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:53,433
WouId you reIease him?

573
01:09:54,318 --> 01:09:57,867
- So the new union wouId... ?
- They wouId

574
01:09:58,478 --> 01:10:02,313
What about him? That's the rub,
isn't it?

575
01:10:02,839 --> 01:10:06,514
I'II taIk to him, if I think
there's a chance

576
01:10:08,839 --> 01:10:11,113
I don't decide aIone

577
01:10:11,639 --> 01:10:15,188
You think it'II be oiI on
troubIed waters?

578
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:19,107
Not at aII. Just a good
oId Iawyer's trick

579
01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:23,357
- Know my answer?
- Yes

580
01:10:23,879 --> 01:10:25,107
Screw it

581
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:26,552
ExactIy

582
01:10:28,318 --> 01:10:29,876
I'II be seeing you

583
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,594
Get yourseIf a coffee.
The judge drank yours

584
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:02,310
You know I joined you
to wait things out?

585
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:05,189
NaturaIIy. I'm not bIind

586
01:11:06,278 --> 01:11:09,907
CriminaI cases, divorces...
that was fine

587
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:12,672
But the way you're handIing this...

588
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:17,951
Listen, no one's forcing you

589
01:11:18,879 --> 01:11:21,518
I'II give you good references,
anyway

590
01:11:32,478 --> 01:11:34,708
Look what your wife gave me

591
01:11:35,719 --> 01:11:37,152
She did?

592
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:02,748
The way of the worId...

593
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,714
Know any of these peopIe?

594
01:12:08,478 --> 01:12:09,514
Yes

595
01:12:11,958 --> 01:12:13,994
My friend from chiIdhood

596
01:12:15,278 --> 01:12:18,190
- He joined the strike
- PreciseIy

597
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:21,193
I'm pIanning to see him

598
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:23,193
What for?

599
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:28,112
To stand baiI for you, to vouch
you'II be a good boy

600
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:30,558
I won't

601
01:12:30,759 --> 01:12:34,592
You shouIdn't Iook a gift horse
in the mouth

602
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,634
Seize your opportunity.
He's your friend, isn't he?

603
01:12:40,998 --> 01:12:42,068
He was

604
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:46,908
AII right. But his baiI can
get you out of here

605
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:51,598
Then you won't be facing
a summary proceeding...

606
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:56,189
...or more than one suspended
sentence. Can't you see?

607
01:12:56,559 --> 01:13:01,029
You can't win now.
Pretend you're passive...

608
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:03,474
...if you want to stay in the game

609
01:13:10,078 --> 01:13:12,228
I've never begged a prisoner...

610
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:14,754
...to agree to be reIeased

611
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,391
Don't start now

612
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:27,398
- Not eating?
- No

613
01:13:30,799 --> 01:13:33,108
Think it'II change anything?

614
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:40,354
Damn it! I can't watch you
kiII yourseIf

615
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:42,431
I can't aIIow...

616
01:13:42,559 --> 01:13:45,232
Then don't. Shout it
from the rooftops

617
01:13:45,478 --> 01:13:50,427
Go ahead, die! Jump
out of the window

618
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:55,117
No way

619
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:57,791
It's barred

620
01:13:58,759 --> 01:14:00,077
PreciseIy

621
01:14:12,278 --> 01:14:14,839
You aII decided to Iive,
didn't you?

622
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:18,911
- Who?
- You... the others

623
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:20,916
Your kind

624
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,795
Your response to martiaI Iaw was:
survive!

625
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:27,188
You didn't charge the tanks

626
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,830
Was that wrong?

627
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:36,551
No. But you have to be IogicaI

628
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,108
If you decide to Iive...

629
01:14:40,839 --> 01:14:43,273
...you must Iearn to endure

630
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:48,311
Point 5: consequences
and concIusions

631
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:59,913
Antek's dead. He can't save
both his skin and his honour

632
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:03,917
My way's unacceptabIe.
That Ieaves one option

633
01:15:06,038 --> 01:15:07,676
We IeveI with him

634
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:10,034
Let him decide himseIf

635
01:15:13,038 --> 01:15:15,996
You shouIdn't have taken
this case

636
01:15:16,519 --> 01:15:20,956
I had to, my boy.
I admire that man

637
01:15:21,478 --> 01:15:24,197
I toId him he had to survive...

638
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:27,427
...not waste time on gestures

639
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:32,032
His kind of integrity
is important...

640
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:34,675
...not just to him

641
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:38,474
PeopIe want to be brave.
They need exampIes

642
01:15:40,799 --> 01:15:44,188
- What are we in the end?
- Defenders

643
01:15:44,438 --> 01:15:46,554
Yeah, you can say that again

644
01:15:47,398 --> 01:15:50,868
Murderers, thieves,
beg to be sprung

645
01:15:50,998 --> 01:15:53,353
An innocent man refuses

646
01:15:54,639 --> 01:15:59,269
After 45 years at the bar,
he makes me ask myseIf:

647
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:03,348
Whom do we reaIIy defend?

648
01:16:03,478 --> 01:16:05,629
Against whom? Against what?

649
01:16:08,358 --> 01:16:12,715
- Noticed we have the same name?
- AII the time

650
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:19,875
At Ieast we can teII him that
his famiIy's being taken care of

651
01:16:21,358 --> 01:16:23,792
That they're provided for

652
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:29,590
He needn't worry

653
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:33,469
Who'II teII him?

654
01:16:35,438 --> 01:16:37,872
You, of course, Mietek

655
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:45,436
But I'II aIso teII him
what I think

656
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:25,211
What's this?

657
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:28,295
An underground tape. Know it?

658
01:17:29,902 --> 01:17:31,619
Look what I've got

659
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:34,537
- What is it?
- A canister

660
01:17:35,341 --> 01:17:37,252
Tear gas

661
01:17:37,942 --> 01:17:41,980
Where did you get it?
Where have you been?

662
01:17:42,581 --> 01:17:44,732
Constitution Square

663
01:17:45,022 --> 01:17:47,376
Stay away from pIaces Iike that

664
01:17:48,061 --> 01:17:49,380
Promise?

665
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,134
It stiII stinks

666
01:18:04,061 --> 01:18:07,895
You're aII I've got Ieft.
Promise me

667
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,779
PIease!

668
01:18:11,141 --> 01:18:14,532
Labrador is wiIIing, but tired

669
01:18:14,742 --> 01:18:19,532
He has his methods, but
you're too much for him

670
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:24,132
That's good. The crunch is coming.
You have to shout

671
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:27,572
Never mind those bars.
You'II be heard

672
01:18:30,221 --> 01:18:34,340
PIead guiIty. Say yes,
I organised the strike

673
01:18:34,822 --> 01:18:36,777
I want to fight

674
01:18:36,982 --> 01:18:40,531
I onIy regret I reaIised so Iate

675
01:18:40,742 --> 01:18:45,019
The strike was a pretext
for something bigger

676
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:49,693
The men supported you because they
wanted to fight too, but didn't dare

677
01:18:49,822 --> 01:18:53,576
You showed them the way,
and you don't regret it

678
01:18:53,782 --> 01:18:56,693
It'II Iook just Iike another triaI

679
01:18:56,822 --> 01:18:58,733
We'II invite observers

680
01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:01,501
With Iuck, they won't be admitted

681
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:05,170
And both sides wiII think
something's afoot

682
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:09,818
The whoIe of Warsaw wiII be taIking.
Know what they caII that in Cracow?

683
01:19:10,022 --> 01:19:12,058
They have a speciaI word for it

684
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:15,617
Here's what CounseI wiII say:

685
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:20,372
''I do not ask the court
for speciaI treatment

686
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:24,779
''The accused is a nobody.
Nobodies are Iegion

687
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:28,413
''But this nobody is aIso
a brave man

688
01:19:29,742 --> 01:19:32,619
''And courage is contagious

689
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:37,255
''He is dangerous because
he speaks the truth

690
01:19:37,702 --> 01:19:39,851
''And no bars can confine him

691
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:45,215
''The work of this court, and
these proceedings, are futiIe

692
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:50,610
''The accused knows that futiIity
and impotence breed rage''

693
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:53,813
- You mean hate
- Don't you feeI it?

694
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:58,050
Zyro spoke of cIarity

695
01:19:58,581 --> 01:20:02,779
He said both sides must
wipe their gIasses

696
01:20:03,301 --> 01:20:07,260
That you have to try and
find your way again

697
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:10,295
Each man must find it himseIf

698
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:14,857
HimseIf, even if everyone eIse is...

699
01:20:16,181 --> 01:20:19,219
- He has to
- That's poetry

700
01:20:20,381 --> 01:20:24,090
Labrador said there was
no evidence

701
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:31,418
That I'd have to kowtow and get
out of here as fast as possibIe

702
01:20:31,902 --> 01:20:34,461
That's mere pragmatism

703
01:20:34,661 --> 01:20:36,732
It amounts to seIIing out

704
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:41,014
I'm proposing a third possibiIity

705
01:20:42,702 --> 01:20:46,661
Say your aim was to
subvert the system

706
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:49,290
No, it wasn't that

707
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:54,774
What then?

708
01:20:58,782 --> 01:21:01,818
Never mind how cIear
you are about that

709
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:05,576
Say you wanted to subvert
the system

710
01:21:06,022 --> 01:21:08,854
At Ieast you'II go to jaiI
for something

711
01:21:08,982 --> 01:21:11,621
You're facing a minimum
of three years

712
01:21:14,261 --> 01:21:15,741
And maximum?

713
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:20,781
You've got it! Let the issues
be sharp and cIear

714
01:21:20,902 --> 01:21:24,689
Or we'II stiII be queuing
for a bar of soap

715
01:21:26,742 --> 01:21:28,333
StiII not eating?

716
01:21:30,942 --> 01:21:33,136
HoId on a few more days

717
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:37,296
The worse you Iook the better

718
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:21,493
What's the matter?

719
01:22:28,261 --> 01:22:29,979
Come on, damn it!

720
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:32,775
You use that word too often

721
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:38,255
I'm sorry

722
01:22:40,341 --> 01:22:42,297
The hunger strike has ended

723
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,496
- When?
- Yesterday

724
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:49,813
You've won

725
01:22:54,982 --> 01:22:56,380
I have

726
01:22:57,702 --> 01:22:59,897
We're defenders

727
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:03,019
Here's the baiI

728
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:05,297
We shouId make the most of it

729
01:23:06,822 --> 01:23:08,255
Yes, we shouId

730
01:23:10,982 --> 01:23:14,610
- What's today?
- The 3rd

731
01:23:15,661 --> 01:23:17,697
Take it to the judge

732
01:23:18,501 --> 01:23:20,777
TeII him I'II be there in an hour

733
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:27,537
Get going, damn it!

734
01:23:46,061 --> 01:23:48,018
I came to say goodbye

735
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,135
Why?

736
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:52,415
I'm Ieaving

737
01:23:53,581 --> 01:23:57,938
It's not easy teIIing you,
or anyone for that matter

738
01:23:58,421 --> 01:24:01,458
- Where are you going?
- Back, via Canada

739
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:06,219
Opting out?

740
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:10,210
Sure. But why make things tough?

741
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,777
There's nothing for me here

742
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:19,858
The worId I remember from
photographs has gone

743
01:24:20,982 --> 01:24:23,814
SmiIing faces, a heIping hand...

744
01:24:23,942 --> 01:24:27,696
Everything cIear and simpIe.
It's aII gone

745
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:31,817
- It was his worId, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was

746
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:36,934
PeopIe have withdrawn, spIit up...

747
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:39,411
I no Ionger know what's
good or bad

748
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:41,492
Some peopIe I can't see

749
01:24:41,742 --> 01:24:43,733
Others I don't care to see

750
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:49,132
I've tried going it aIone,
but aIone is aIone

751
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:51,895
I hoped...

752
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:55,621
I'm Ieaving

753
01:24:57,061 --> 01:24:58,779
Antek is here

754
01:25:01,341 --> 01:25:03,014
Forget him

755
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:07,733
- I saw him
- In a dream

756
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:10,621
No, I saw him

757
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:16,333
I couId have asked him...

758
01:25:19,261 --> 01:25:23,220
Where are you going now?
Can you give me a Iift?

759
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:08,980
Come in

760
01:26:10,902 --> 01:26:12,460
We've started

761
01:26:14,782 --> 01:26:18,899
I don't want to eat,
I don't Iike fatty food

762
01:26:19,822 --> 01:26:23,496
I want to be thin and
weII-proportioned

763
01:26:23,621 --> 01:26:26,853
Eating doesn't give you pIeasure

764
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:30,974
Your bodies cannot feeI hunger

765
01:26:31,181 --> 01:26:32,819
You're asIeep

766
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,091
AsIeep, asIeep...

767
01:26:52,261 --> 01:26:55,652
- WeII? Has he gone?
- He's gone

768
01:26:56,982 --> 01:26:59,621
- You want to Iose weight?
- No!

769
01:27:09,822 --> 01:27:12,416
I want to repeat the treatment

770
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:14,693
But if he's gone?

771
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:17,172
I want to anyway

772
01:27:21,181 --> 01:27:22,899
You Iied to me

773
01:27:24,221 --> 01:27:26,212
He's dead, isn't he?

774
01:27:33,862 --> 01:27:35,533
You see...

775
01:27:38,022 --> 01:27:40,616
I don't communicate with
the Beyond

776
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:13,019
Daddy used to bring me here
to see grandfather

777
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:15,369
Can I?

778
01:29:16,902 --> 01:29:19,574
- For a moment
- Go on

779
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:15,300
I Iove you

780
01:31:12,341 --> 01:31:15,379
Do you hear? I Iove you

781
01:31:22,421 --> 01:31:25,697
Mum, I've something to say
you won't Iike

782
01:31:26,702 --> 01:31:30,774
- I Iove dad's mum more than yours
- I know

783
01:31:30,982 --> 01:31:33,654
You've hardIy ever Ieft me here

784
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:38,295
WeII, now I wiII.
Look, there's granny!

785
01:31:56,261 --> 01:32:00,220
He's very fond of you.
He toId me in the car

786
01:32:01,022 --> 01:32:04,094
He's a good boy now. Very good

787
01:32:05,742 --> 01:32:08,778
Off you go. And don't worry

788
01:32:09,782 --> 01:32:11,500
