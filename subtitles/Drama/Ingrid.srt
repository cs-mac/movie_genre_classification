Okay, Ingrid Thorburn.
You... you like the place?

87
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,965
- Are you the landlord?
- Yes, I'd shock you.

88
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,702
I'm the dude who lives next door
which you pay rent to.

89
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,837
The landlord thing is
just a side hassle

90
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,439
so I can get my real shit
up the ground.

91

You're in movies?

92
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,311
- Yeah.
- Anything I've seen?

93
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,748
- Alright, Batman?
- You wrote that?

94
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,184
No, but I'm writing
a spec script.

95
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,086
It's-it's not authorized,
but I think it will be

96
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,754
a nice installment
in a franchise.

97
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,089
How much is this place?

98
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,991
Twenty-nine hundred,
the first two months,

99
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,260
plus the security deposit.
No pets!

Do you take cash?

102
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,078
- Are you an escort or something?
- No.

103
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,747
Fuck!

104
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,882
- Are you a drug dealer?
- No.

105
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,951
Okay, for real what you do?

106
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,019
You got a backpack
full of money.

107

Suspicious.

108

109
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,461
my mom just died
and left me a bunch of money.

110
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,933
I didn't mean to offend.
Like, my condolences. I mean...

111
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,269
It's okay.
It's all there.

112
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,808
- Thank you.
- Fuck off, then.

113
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,510
Alright. Bye.
See ya' later then.

What's your biggest
emotional wound?

115
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,286
- What?
- It's our question of the day.

116
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,490
- Oh.

117
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,992
Mine's actually my relationship
with my dad.

118
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,564
- I'm good, thanks.

00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,436
Oh, god, I hope they brought
cards again...

160
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,206
Oh, I know.
I don't wanna play mafia again.

161
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,356
Shh. Hi, Rothko.

162
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,660
Want a treat?

163
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,229
Oh, yeah.

164
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,531
- Oh, good boy.

165
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,633
Shhh. Good boy.

166
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,838
Shh! Shh! Stop.

167
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,843
Quiet. It's okay.
Be quiet.

168
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,546
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up!

169
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,648
<i>Yo!</i>

170
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,250
- Fuck!
- <i>Ingrid.</i>

171
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,819
Shh. It's okay.

172
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,821
- <i>I know you're in there.</i>
- Shut up. It's okay.

173
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,790
- Coming!
- <i>Come on.</i>

174
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,659
<i>Ingrid!</i>

175
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,796
- Hey.
- Yo, what's going on?

176
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,465
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

177
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,535
What? Did you get
a new haircut or something?

178
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,770
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I just...

179
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,473
When in California...

180
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,909
Um, did you get a dog?

181
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,678
- No.
- 'Cause it definitely sounds

182
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,748
- like there's a dog in here.
- Yeah, that's because

183
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,550
I was watching
a movie about dogs.

184
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,352
Oh, watcha' watchin'?
<i>Beethoven?</i>

185
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,354
- Yes.
- Wanna watch it the next door?

186
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,622
I mean I got a bubbler,
you know.

187
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,290
I got way more food
than you got here.

188
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,730
Oh, you already have company.
I see!

189
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,200
My friend asked me to dog sit.
Okay?

190
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,602
What did I ask you to do?
No pets. That's all.

191
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,438
My only stipulation.
I'm allergic to dogs, Ingrid.

192
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,775
Okay. Um, it's just one night.
He won't go near you

193
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,477
and he's leaving tomorrow.
I promise.

194
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,245
You leaving tomorrow,
if he doesn't.

195
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,446
Okay.

196
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,296
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

197
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,399
Hi, I'm not sure
if I have the right number.

198
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,868
I'm calling about a lost dog
named Rothko.

199
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,637
<i>Babe, we got Rothko.
Babe, someone found Rothko.</i>

200
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,206
<i>But is he okay?</i>

201
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,543
Yeah, he's... he's good

202
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,712
<i>okay, where do you live?
I'm gonna come there right now</i>

203
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,581
oh, um, you know what, actually?

204
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,651
My... it's not a good time.
I'm actually running errands,

205
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,588
so, how about I just swing
on over to you guys

206
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,757
and I'll just drop him off,
to mummy and daddy!

207
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,859
Okay? Sounds good?
So I'll be right over.

208
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,662
<i>Okay, okay. Well, wait,
don't you need the address?</i>

209
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,334
Yeah, of course
I need the address.

210
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,269
Let me just get a pen.

211
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,339
Okay, got one.

212
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,759
- Hi!
- Oh, my god! Thank you so much!

213
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:06,264
- Hi. Oh, it's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay.

214
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,966
You're home.
You're home.

215
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,669
- My god! You're a life saver.
- Good boy.

216
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,839
- Hi, I'm Taylor.
- Ingrid.

217
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,974
- Thank you so much!
- How's it going?

218
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,442
Where did you find him?

219
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,412
Just a couple of blocks
from here. So weird!

220
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,781
Oh, sorry! Before I forget.
Sorry.

221
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,915
Oh, look, you guys wear

222
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,617
- the same purse!

223
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,319
- It's crazy!
- Oh, my god!

224
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,687
So random.

225
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:32,957
- I'm naming it down to cash.
- Oh, please, no, I...

226
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,026
I don't want your money.
Please.

227
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,628
Oh! No, no, no.
Come on. We insist, please.

228
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,530
- No, really... yes!
- Are you sure?

229
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,433
Yes. He's so cute.
He was just good company.

230
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,669
Honestly,
I'm just glad he's home.

231
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,470
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

232
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,707
Whoa, we can't let you
go empty-handed.

233
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,677
We're making dinner.
Let us make you dinner.

234
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,812
- Yes! I love that idea.
- It's a good idea.

235
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,447
Oh, yeah.
I mean, you should...

236
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,382
Absolutely,
unless have other plans.

237
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,322
Nope. I'm free.

238
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,498
I haven't seen that in a while.

239
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,900
Here.

240
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,337
I do have to apologize because
we've been so stressed out

241
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,572
with Rothko being gone that
we haven't had the opportunity

242
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:24,575
- to go to farmer's market yet.
- Oh, it's fine.

243
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,646
Yeah, I hope you don't mind
if we improvise a little. Huh?

244
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,481
You know what I mean?

245
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,416
I don't mind that.

246
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,698
I feel like I'm in a restaurant.

247
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,953
More like kitchen nightmares.

248
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,455
You wish!

249
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,858
Holy fuck! This is incredible.

250
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,594
Jesus!
This is fucking delicious.

251
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,829
Have we met before?

252
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,433
No, no, definitely not.

253
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,635
'Cause your face,
it looks so familiar.

254
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,872
Can I use your bathroom?

255
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,883
And so
we're learning how to surf...

256
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,184
and all of a sudden,

257
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,153
- I got stung by a jellyfish.
- No!

258
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:43,954
I thought it was a man o'war.

259
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:47,024
And then... that's right.
He...

260
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,428
- Yeah, I-i-i peed...
- Yeah. He had to pee on my leg.

261
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,430
- I peed on her leg.
- Ew! He did not?

262
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,899
You know, it was kinda gross,
but kinda hot, too.

263
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,534
- Yeah.
- we don't need to redo it,

264
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,068
but it was actually
not that bad.

265
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,837
Oh, you wanna
reenact it right now?

266
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,739
No.

267
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,141
You wanna...
Wanna another glass of "vino,"

268
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,010
- to top it off?
- Yeah, thanks.

269
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,578
Yeah, you gotta' own that baby.

270
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,847
- Anyone wants more of it?
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,918
So, what do you guys do
for money?

272
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,953
Ah, I'm a photographer.

273
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,988
Wow! That's amazing

274
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,225
I mean, it's not as glamorous
as it sounds occasionally.

275
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:24,161
Brands, they pay me
to post things online.

276
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,864
She's really...
She's really good.

277
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,633
- Cool.
- Really good, really creative.

278
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,801
Thanks, baby.

279
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,738
Oh, my god, I know where...
I know where we met.

280
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,775
Um, it was
the echo park craft fair.

281
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,744
And you were selling
those Bolivian Clay pots.

282
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,546
- Right! The pots.
- I bought like, eight.

283
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,683
Not me.
Actually, I just moved here.

284
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,055
Maybe, you're confusing her
with one of your insta-fans.

285
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,059
He's just giving me shit because

286
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,695
I happen to engage
with people on social media

287
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,563
like the rest
of the known universe,

288
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,933
and my husband has
a chronic case of technophobia.

289
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,002
- Wow.
- He still uses a flip phone.

290
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,038
- No! Yeah! No, he does not.
- Wow! Okay, alright.

291
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
- Okay, first of... I got...
- Can you hear me?

292
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,109
S-stop. Stop.

293
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:16,080
I just prefer to keep certain
parts of my life, private.

294
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,715
That's it. That's all.

295
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,918
And... and let...
You know, just let my work

296
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,621
sort of just speak for itself.
That's...

297
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:24,955
You know, we talked about that.

298
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,224
Ezra is an artist.

299
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,126
Really?
What kinda stuff do you do?

300
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,665
Yeah, I guess
you could label it, um...

301
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,268
Pop art. That's what I have kind
of calling it.

302
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,303
But I haven't... there's no...
I don't like labels,

303
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:42,072
- you know what I mean?
- You do backgrounds as well?

304
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,309
Um, no, no,
those are found objects

305
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,811
from flea markets
across the United States.

306
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,680
- Yeah.
- Are any of these for sale?

307
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,917
- I don't... not technically...
- Yes, they are.

308
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,885
- You know? Yeah, yeah, they are.
- Yeah.

309
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,346
How much is this one?

310
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,890
- How much..
- What do we say, 12, $1,200?

311
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,059
- I think it's what he said.
- Yeah.

312
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,062
- Ballpark, $1,200.
- Cool. I'll take it.

313
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,964
Do you take cash?

314
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,104
- Oopsy, sorry!

315
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,140
- In those.
- To my baby.

316
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,978
Okay.
To our new friend, Ingrid.

317
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,748
Rescuer of dogs.

318
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,585
- Patron of the arts.
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,955
And... all around
a really great neighbor.

320
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,091
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

321
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,899
Um, so if you need anything...

322
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:44,301
Um, transportation.
I can bring it over tomorrow,

323
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,236
- um, I gotta...
- No, I can take it tonight.

324
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,372
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I'll take it myself.

325
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,741
- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.
- What? What's the matter?

326
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,710
- What's going on?
- Is everything okay?

327
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,013
Yeah, it's fine. It's just that
my friend Anish keeps promising

328
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,048
to help me take our trailer,
in the driveway,

329
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,218
to our place in Joshua tree,
and she just flaked at the end.

330
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,954
- It's cool. We'll figure it out.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.

331
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,223
Who else we know
that has a truck?

332
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,032
Hey. Okay, one second.
Shit.

333
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,002
Yes? Oh, hey.
Hey, Ingrid. Hey.

334
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,839
- I need to borrow your truck.
- Oh, the bat mobile?

335
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,343
It's chill. Where we going?
Ikea? Home depot?

336
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,178
No, actually,
I need it this Saturday.

337
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,847
Uh, no, no.
No, no can't do.

338
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,415
- Just for a couple of hours.
- No, my table read...

339
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,683
- Please.
- For my script.

340
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,692
Is this Saturday night. I...
That's okay, that's okay.

341
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:36,954
I just need it during the day,
and I'll totally have it back

342
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,790
before your table read
or whatever, I promise.

343
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:40,991
Or whatever.

344
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,327
- Please.
- I don't know, Ingrid.

345
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,029
Please, please, please, please.

346
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,964
I'll do anything

347
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,832
anything?

348
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,835
It's funny you should say that

349
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,004
cause' the chick who
we got to play Catwoman,

350
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,407
she got booked to do
this nickelodeon thing

351
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,208
and I need a replacement so..

352
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,244
You don't have anyone else
who can do that?

353
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,279
Don't you have another truck
you could use?

354
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,216
Oh!
Come on, Catwoman.

355
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,385
Scratch my back.
I'll scratch yours.

356
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,889
Deal.

357
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:16,293
Come here Saturday. Be here.
Six o' clock.

358
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,228
Meow.

359
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,731
Yeah... I like that.

360
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,837
I can't believe you've never
been to Joshua tree before.

361
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,074
- I know.
- Oh, my god,

362
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,743
we should go to integratron
and get a sound bath.

363
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,311
Do you know what that is?

364
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,015
Yeah, it's like,
so healing and re-grounding.

365
00:28:38,017 --> 00:28:40,851
- It's really incredible.
- Cool.

366
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,223
Oh, my god! What is this?

367
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,860
I had no idea you were
so into Batman.

368
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,133
- I'm not.

369
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,269
- Hey, chill. Chill.
- We're good.

370
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,437
Oh, my god.

371
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,475
My brother was like obsessed
with this movie growing up.

372
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,278
- You've a brother?
- Yeah, Nicky.

373
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:12,416
He's amazing, he's like so funny
and like, genius level smart.

374
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,885
I mean, he had a few rushes
with the law

375
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,353
but he's like totally sober now.

376
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,388
Oh, it's good.

377
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,462
- Maybe you should pull over?
- No, it's fine.

378
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,766
It does this thing
all the time, this gutter.

379
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,201
I'm gonna just see
if there's like, a manual or...

380
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,904
Holy shit! Jesus Christ, Ingrid

381
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,806
- oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

382
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,374
Why do you have a gun in here?

383
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,477
It's not real.
It's... just close it.

384
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,813
It's just to scare people.

385
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,516
- It's fine, I don't even...
- Who is Daniel pinto?

386
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,853
I can't people you didn't
tell me you had a boyfriend.

387
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,823
I know, but it's not serious
or anything, that's why.

388
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,092
Is he your drug dealer?

389
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,462
No. He's...
He's a screenplay writer.

390
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,564
He writes movies.

391
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:04,334
Oh, my god. A tortured artist.
I love that.

392
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,137
I know. Me too.

393
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,373
How long you guys been dating?

394
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,876
Like a week.

395
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,246
You... you've been dating a week
and he's already letting

396
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,549
- you borrow his truck.
- yeah.

397
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,319
- Why? Is that weird?
- No. Damn, girl.

398
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,255
You just... you move fast.
That's incredible.

399
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,292
What did you do
to get that one? Shit.

400
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:31,261
I know.
I just gave him a blowjob.

401
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,301
You're so funny. I love you
so much. You're amazing.

402
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,603
Oh, my god,
you're my favorite person,

403
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,172
I've ever met.
Oh, my god.

404
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,507
You're good to go ladies.

405
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,442
Engine just needed
to cool down a bit.

406
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,145
Oh, my god,
you're a Saint smithy,

407
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,314
- thank you so much!
- Thank you so much!

408
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,917
Would you mind, actually just
snapping a quick photo of us?

409
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,285
That'd be really great.

410
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,554
- Okay.
- Thank you.

411
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,427
Okay, cheese.

412
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,631
Actually, that smile,
and if you hold your back

413
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,199
down like this,
it might look better.

414
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,168
And even at an angle, maybe.
Cool.

415
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,339
Okay, here you go.

416
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,574
Thank you.

417
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,278
Sorry, would you actually,
would you mind

418
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,513
just taking a few more?
Maybe, if you got lower,

419
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,415
then you can get
the sign above our heads,

420
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,384
and that would be amazing.
Here you go.

421
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,253
- Thanks, you're the best.
- Sure.

422
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,889
Just do it on your left.

423
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,292
If you get lower,
that would be better.

424
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,462
- You mean on the floor?
- Yeah, if you can.

425
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,597
Okay.

426
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,299
Last one.

427
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,968
Should we try one
with the peace sign?

428
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,169
Yeah.

429
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,579
Oh, my god,
I love this time of the day.

430
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,950
I'm just not sure
if we should paint it or not.

431
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,418
I think I like this color.

432
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,589
I think it's perfect.
So nice here.

433
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,691
I mean, you really
should've seen it

434
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,693
when we bought it,
because it was wild.

435
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,496
Then Ezra and I were able to do
all the renovations ourselves,

436
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,197
- which was really special.

437
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,399
He's so great at that.

438
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,238
We should probably
head back soon.

439
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,206
No, are you crazy?
We just got here.

440
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,545
I know something we should do.

441
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,154
- Do you do this a lot?
- Not anymore, really.

442
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:39,456
I think the last time we did
it was probably burning man.

443
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,091
- Have you been to burning man?

444
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,592
Cause' you could totally
join our camp next year.

445
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,095
It'd be really fun.
Oh, I'm so happy we are here.

446
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:47,364
Happy's is the best.
I mean, like,

447
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,334
the crowd it is a bit stretch,
but they always have great music

448
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,302
- in the fest as surprise.
- cool.

449
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,537
Mm-hmm.

450
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,008
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, totally.

451
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,311
- It's Dan checking up on me.
- Oh, that's really sweet.

452
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,014
Ezra never checks up on me.
Come on, hurry up.

453
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,383
Oh, yeah. Now, I'm gonna...
Gonna do it too.

454
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09,052
I wanna dance, I wanna dance,
I wanna dance, I wanna dance.

455
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,305
- No, to you.
- No, to you.

456
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,007
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

457
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,415
Shot, shot, shot, shot,
shot, shot, shot, shot...

458
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,260
Dan's gonna kill me.

459
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,696
Okay, you need to relax,
it's just a scratch.

460
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,331
And I bet
he won't even notice it.

461
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,766
You can buff that right out.

462
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,695
What do you think
I should say happened?

463
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,671
Um... say like,

464
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:44,774
"look, I made a mistake."
And I'm sure he'll understand.

465
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,545
Now, you really shouldn't let
a little scratch

466
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,847
ruin otherwise perfect night.

467
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,651
Yeah, you're so right.

468
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,822
Can I tell you a secret?

469
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,825
Um... yeah.

470
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,928
Do you see
that house over there?

471
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,765
- Twenty-two, flamingo Lane.
- Yeah.

472
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,468
Well, I'm thinking
about buying it.

473
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,238
And this is gonna sound like,
such a crazy idea...

474
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,476
But I have this dream
of opening a boutique hotel

475
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,946
that's filled with like,
everything I love,

476
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,848
and everything in it
is for sale.

477
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,251
I's gonna be like my Instagram,
but in real life.

478
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,421
Okay, you have to do that.
Like, now.

479
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,956
That's amazing.

480
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,192
I'm thinking about calling it...

481
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,360
"Desert door."

482
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,632
- Did you just come up with that?
- No, I mean, i... I wish.

483
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,235
It's from this Norman mailer
book that I'm obsessed with

484
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,736
called<i> the deer park.</i>

485
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,306
<i>- The deer park?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,676
Could you actually promise
that, um...

487
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,844
Not to say anything to Ezra?

488
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,814
Because I haven't actually
talked to him about it yet.

489
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,284
Yeah. Why?

490
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,854
I don't know. Like, ever since
I convinced him to quit his job

491
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,756
and become an artist full time,

492
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,593
he's just been like,
super-weird about money.

493
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,463
But I thought you said
his paintings were popular.

494
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,864
No, I mean, like,
don't get me wrong.

495
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,900
He is absurdly talented,
but he doesn't

496
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,402
believe in self-promotion,
and just like, thinks...

497
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,706
It's really phony or something.
I'm sorry, I'm like,

498
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,875
talking at you.
You probably think I'm awful.

499
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,344
No.

500
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,747
- You're perfect.
- Yeah, perfectly fucked up.

501
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,482
No.

502
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,819
You are, by far the coolest,

503
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,288
most interesting person
I've ever met.

504
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,323
I'm serious.

505
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,493
My god.
Thank you.

506
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,266
You're a really good friend,
Ingrid.

507

We're missing all
these shooting stars.

508
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,375
- Hmm.
- Come on.

509
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,313
We did it.

510
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,384
Thank you.

511
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,754
- Thank you.
- Oh, and tell Dan

512
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,523
I'm really sorry
about his truck.

513
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,492
But I'm really looking forward
to meeting him.

514
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,928
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

515
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,369
<i>Its obviously day,
so I don't know where she is.</i>

516
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,771
- Shit. Shit, shit.
- <i>I tried calling her...</i>

517
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,574
- Hey.

518
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,744
I apologize to you, guys.
Sorry for wasting your time.

519
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,848
- Yo! Where the fuck were you?
- I'm sorry...

520
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,483
- You sorry?
- Yeah. I'm...

521
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:16,019
False alarm, guys.
Go on about your day.

522
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,821
- Fuck!
- How was the table read?

523
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,890
How was... I had to cancel it.
No Catwoman. No table read.

524
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,029
- What the fuck is this?
- I know. Look, you can probably

525
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,064
- buff it right out.
- Look at my shit!

526
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,600
It was an accident, okay.
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,469
I'll pay for it, okay?

528
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,070
Some of it.

529
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,507
- All of it, okay?
- Is there anything else

530
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,975
I need to know about Ingrid?

531
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,512
We might have done
all of your cocaine

532
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:43,980
- that we found in the...
- Shut the fuck up.

533
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,984
Thank you, guys. All good.
Thank you for your service.

534
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,919
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

535
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,424
I trusted you.
As you live here.

536
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,760
I called the police
worried about you.

537
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,028
I should've been worried
about my fucking truck.

538
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,400
You're supposed to be Catwoman.
You ain't nothing but two-faced.

539
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,402
Here I was looking out for you.

540
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:08,037
- Fuck that. Don't, watch out.
- Dan.

541
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,140
- It's just a...

Ah, I was thinking like,
two or three weeks tops.

Ah, i... sorry...
Wha... two or three weeks?

- It's the best surprise ever.
- Best surprise! Eh-heh!

- Best surprise!

Oh, my god,
this is such a great bottle.

I know, I thought
you liked that kind.

- Thank you.
- All right, nice.

- Cool.
- What's your story, "Olga"?

596
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:05,949
It's Ingrid.

597
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,718
Do you speak French?

598
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,660
So I'm chilling
in the Ritz lobby

599
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,063
and I just happen
to strike up a conversation

600
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:21,931
with this Chinese billionaire
named Bruno;

601
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,633
- which doesn't make any sense...
- Nicky and I both,

602
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,801
we studied mandarin in college.

603
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:29,872
Yes, we did bullshit back, man.
Anyway, the next thing I know,

604
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:33,109
some security guy comes up
and Jacks us up by our throats.

605
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,877
So then I... I decided
it's a good idea

606
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,646
to take a swing at him,
of course, so...

607
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:37,880
Ouch.

608
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,585
Um, sorry, I thought you were
supposed to be sober, Nicky.

609
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,051
I am, I am. Anyway, cops came,

610
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,787
I hitched a ride to the airport.
Then I realized

611
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,156
I left my credit card
at the hotel.

612
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,958
- Right.
- But then, while I'm chilling

613
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,394
at the airport, at de Gaulle,
guess who is right next to me?

614
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,298
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

615
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,666
Look, I'm done.

616
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:59,370
I gotta get another drink. It's
a really good racist story.

617
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:00,670
Keep going. Um...

618
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:02,338
- Wow! Does that bother you...?
- Hey, baby,

619
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,706
can you get another bottle,
please?

620
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,041
Sure, and a new brother too.

621
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:07,276
- Anyway, the little fucked was...
- There's more?

622
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:08,945
- Yeah.
- I thought you were done.

623
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,247
He was so thankful for me
showing him a good time

624
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,149
that he bought me
a first-class ticket to L.A.

625
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,084
- That's so crazy.
- I watched 12 hours

He gets a hand job

627
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,855
from some fashion chick named
Harley something or other.

628
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,891
- Harley Chung?
- Yes. Yes! You know her?

629
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,127
No, not personally, but she's
like, over a million followers.

630
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,929
Well, I'm having dinner with her
tomorrow night, at chateau.

631
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,265
- You wanna go?
- Um, yes! Obviously.

632
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:31,167
- Yay! Let's do it.

633
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,103
Yay!
Except that you can't,

634
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,072
because we are going
to that launch party,

635
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,941
tomorrow night, remember?
Littledoe?

636
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,344
- The hats.
- Right.

637
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,712
I got us on the list.

638
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,147
- Oh, you did.
- Oh, shoot.

639
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:46,382
- Yeah.
- Thanks. I am on list?

640
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,820
No, sorry.
I could barely get us on.

641
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:54,023
- Right, right.
- Yeah. It's okay,

642
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,759
you guys should totally go.
It sounds like a fun, fun time.

643
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:58,227
It's gonna be so fun.

644
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,731
Whatever, just never gonna meet
Harley, then?

645
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,836
Hey? Would you mind
if I bail, actually?

646
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:10,239
'Cause Nicky and I,
we never get to hangout and...

647
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,942
Why don't you just go
without me?

648
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:14,877
Like, you should totally
bring Dan.

649
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,380
Okay.

650
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,817
No problem.
You guys, have fun.

651
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,721
And I'll bring Dan. He loves
that kinda stuff anyway.

654
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,416
Hey. Oh. Thank you.

655
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:19,909
- Taylor!
- Ingrid!

656
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,444
Taylor!

657
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,280
Oh, my god, you made it.

658
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,084
Yeah, duh, I made it.
I invited you. You made it.

659
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,419
Well, alright, alright.
Harley, she knows the designers

660
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,855
so they got us VIP passes.
Just really last minute.

661
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,926
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

662
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:39,362
Oh, god! Where's
your imaginary boyfriend?

663
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,265
Sorry?

664
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,133
You guys were joking
about it too.

665
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,968
No, we were just...
We were saying that

666
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,804
we'd love to meet Daniel.
We haven't met him yet

667
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,172
and he just made a joke
about him being

668
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,807
- your imaginary boyfriend.
- I wasn't joking.

669
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,942
And we know he is not imaginary.

670
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,143
I know.

671
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,245
- No, he's not imaginary.
- No?

672
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,247
He's just busy tonight.
He's a writer so...

673
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,416
Oh, really?
Like... like a ghost writer?

674
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,885
He's a... come on,
I know it's funny.

675
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,321
I got an idea. Why don't you
come to Harley's house?

676
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,356
She's house sitting
for this super-rich dude

677
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:08,424
- in the hills.
- Yeah.

678
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:09,724
We're gonna have a pool party,
it will be awesome.

679
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:10,924
- You can come this weekend.
- Bring Dan.

680
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:12,224
- If that's okay.
- This weekend?

681
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:13,896
- If that's cool.
- That's right, invite everyone.

682
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:17,066
- I will. I just invited Ingrid.
- baby, you should come.

683
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,868
Yeah, so bring a bathing suit,

684
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,004
lots of sunscreen, a nice hat,
and your boyfriend obviously.

685
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,573
Excuse me, miss?
Can I have your name?

686
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,575
- Sorry?
- Can I have your name, please?

687
00:47:25,577 --> 00:47:27,977
- Oh, Ingrid.
- Last name?

688
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,046
- Thorburn.
- Thorburn?

689
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,917
Thorburn? There's
no Thorburn on this list.

690
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,454
I'm on the list, I've been
on the list for like two weeks.

691
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,256
And you know what, sir,
she's actually with us.

692
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,091
- So, it's totally cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

693
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:44,493
So sorry, we got a full house.
It's a VIPs only tonight.

694
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,095
Oh, boy.

695
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,564
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
He was so mean.

696
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,066
You have to leave.

697
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,134
Oh, really?

698
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,936
Well, how about I just text you
about the weekend

699
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:55,438
and send you
all the information?

700
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,106
- Please.
- Okay, cool.

701
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,476
- Okay, bye.
- Bye!

702
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,668
- What do you what?
- Nothing, I just...

703
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,603
Came by to say hi.

704
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,639
That's nice. Hi.

705
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,008
And I got you this.

706
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:33,676
- What is it?
- Open it.

707
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,153
Nice try, Ingrid.

708
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,489
- What? You don't like it?
- No, of course I love it.

709
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:48,491
That's why I bought it on Ebay
two years ago.

710
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,193
- Good looks, though.
- Right. There's more. Look.

711
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,167
See? Indica.
Anybody who knows me,

712
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,236
knows I only smoke sativa.
And an eight-ball

713
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:02,038
would've been more appropriate,
don't you think?

714
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,440
Look, I'm trying. Okay?
That jacket cost like $400.

715
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,376
Eight thousand dollars' worth
of damage to my truck.

716
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,079
- I should throw you out.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

717
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,282
I did something really shitty.
I took advantage of you

718
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,451
and I feel really bad about it.
Okay?

719
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,186
I made a mistake.

720
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,490
Can we please just start over
and pretend it never happened?

721
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,259
Like a reboot?

722
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,394
Okay!

723
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:28,965
Yes. Like a reboot.

724
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,634
Can I take you to dinner?

725
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,072
Can I pick the place?

726
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,010
You get Jim Carrey
as the riddler...

727
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,379
That has... that should make
you wanna see anything.

728
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,480
Kilmer, Val Kilmer.

729
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:47,016
He could kill everybody
in this fucking room right now.

730
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,751
Homie Joel? Joel Schumacher.

731
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:52,555
Joel Schumacher? Yes, he was
the best Batman, for sure.

732
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,391
- Me too, i...
- No, no, no. He's the director.

733
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,026
Joel.

734
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,095
You like this place?

735
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,266
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Chill spot. I know I like it.

736
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,236
- Do you come here a lot?
- Way too often.

737
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:08,337
They would charge me rent,

738
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,739
- if they could.
- Dan?

739
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:13,242
- Hey! Cindy. How are you?
- I'm so good, how are you?

740
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,077
- Good. You're looking well.
- Oh, my gosh,

741
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,712
it's been so long since
I've seen you.

742
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,315
Yeah, you know.
Jus... just working.

743
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:21,350
- Well, you're a busy man.
- Well, that means he is...

744
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,451
We're on a date.

745
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,554
- Oh, um, sorry.
- Alright.

746
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,262
Whoa, Catwoman has claws.

747
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,631
I like that.

748
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,467
Why do you like Batman so much?

749
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,469
What's not to like about Batman?

750
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:43,339
I'm sorry, it's just,
I don't understand.

751
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,609
He's just another superhero
like spiderman or superman...

752
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:48,344
That's where you are wrong.
Batman is the world's

753
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,480
greatest detective.
Nothing radioactive bit him.

754
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:55,217
He's not from another planet.
He's just like you or I.

755
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,687
All Batman's powers come
from within him.

756
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,823
He had enough will
and enough focus

757
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:03,659
to make himself greater
than what he was.

758
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,628
And...

759
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,831
He... in the beginning,
before he's Batman,

760
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:13,202
he loses his parents.
That definitely stuck with me.

761
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,639
As an orphan, I definitely felt
a connection towards him.

762
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,643
Oh, my god. You're an orphan?
I'm so sorry.

763
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,447
It's fine. He made it through.
I'll make it through.

764
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,316
What happened to your parents?

765
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,819
It was a car accident.

766
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,689
Yeah.
It happened when I was a kid,

767
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:36,092
and I didn't know
how to cope with it.

768
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,494
So, at school,
I'd wear a Batman mask.

769
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,130
Make everybody call me Bruce...

770
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,233
And pretend to be somebody else.
So, it was like...

771
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,602
It happened to somebody else.

772
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:49,338
What about you?

773
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,140
What about you?
What's your story?

774
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:53,142
Um, yeah, I don't really
like Batman that much.

775
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:54,376
No, no.

776
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,279
With your mom?
What's your story with your mom?

777
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,614
What happened?

778
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,152
She had a heart attack.

779
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,522
I mean, she was sick
before that.

780
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,825
You guys were close?

781
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,195
Yeah, we were really close.
We were...

782
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,564
I lived with her.
And um...

783
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,433
It's just been really hard.

784
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:21,370
Because it was kinda like,
I lost my best friend.

785
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,441
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

786
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,776
- No, don't. Don't.
- Getting too intense. I'm sorry.

787
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,445
You must think I'm the worst.
I'm not.

788
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,482
Listen. Don't worry about that.
Don't even talk about that.

789
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,651
You don't ever have
to apologize to me

790
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,486
about how you're feeling.

791
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,756
It may seem like I don't care.
I put up a front, you know.

792
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,324
But I definitely care about you.

793
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,628
Why?

794
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,632
To me, um...

795
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,368
I don't know,
it's just that you have

796
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,503
a different kind of ring to you

797
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,838
you have a different
kind of shine.

798
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,474
And I just think
somebody needs to appreci...

799
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,963
Meow.

800
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:02,938
Fuck me, Bruce.

801
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,912
- Fuck me, Bruce.
- Tell me Gotham needs me.

802
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,714
Gotham needs you.

803
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,549
Now.

804
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,685
You were great, by the way.

805
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,622
No one's ever done that
for me before.

806
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,558
Hmm.

807
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,961
You were great too.

808
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,330
Thank you, mama.

809
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,673
Hey, so, my friends are renting
a house this weekend...

810
00:54:37,675 --> 00:54:39,008
Mm-hmm.

811
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,411
They're having like,
a party or something.

812
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:43,712
Do you wanna come with me?

813
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,550
- Oh, yeah?
- Hmm.

814
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,321
Of course, baby.

815
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,794
You're the best.

816
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,464
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.

817
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,334
Do I get to use this shit
buttoned up all the way?

818
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:07,670
Yes, it looks better that way.
Don't be a baby.

819
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:09,505
- I'm being a baby.
- Stop that!

820
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,640
Don't do that
in front of everybody.

821
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,742
- Alright, come on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

822
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,678
- A couple of ground rules, okay?
- Okay.

823
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,614
I need you to tell everyone
that you're my boyfriend.

824
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:20,582
It's a long story,
but I just need you

825
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,718
- to say that to everyone.
- No, no, no, no, no, I get it.

826
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,520
And I see that you dig me,
I dig you.

827
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,055
- I'll be your boyfriend.
- Okay.

828
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:27,756
- I'll be your boyfriend.
- Okay, whatever.

829
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,925
And also, no Batman talk.

830
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,795
What am I supposed to talk
about? I don't know them.

831
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:36,365
Something cool, like food
or clothes or Joan Didion.

832
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,599
Okay.

833
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,802
Don't talk about comic books
or anything.

834
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,704
These people don't care
about stuff like that.

835
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,373
- Anything else you might...
- Yes. Whatever you do,

836
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,742
- just stay away from Nicky.
- Who's Nicky?

837
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,679
Nicky is Taylor's brother,
and he's a fucking liar,

838
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,848
a drug addict and just
not to be trusted, okay?

839
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,783
- Girl, what's up?
- Hey.

840
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,120
- Who's that?
- This is Dan pinto.

841
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,489
My imaginary boyfriend.

842
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,491
- Dan pinto?
- Yeah.

843
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,827
My sister says
you're obsessed with Batman.

844
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,131
- Yea... yeah.
- Wow, get the fuck out!

845
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:12,368
Oh, god, why didn't you tell me?
I fucking love Batman.

846
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,769
Nicky. Great to meet ya!

847
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,505
Harley!

848
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:39,928
- Anybody needs a beer?
- No beer, bro.

849
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,123
What's your problem with Nick?
Why don't you like him?

850
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,706
I mean, he seem chill.

851
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,976
He's not chill. Okay?
And he doesn't like you.

852
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,478
He's only being nice to you
to fuck with me.

853
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,482
Damn. Excuse me, can he like
me for my personality shit?

854
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,918
- Hey. Is everything okay?
- Yeah everything is chill.

855
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,054
We're just talking about how
amazing this house is, right?

856
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,690
- Yeah. It's a dope spot.
- Pinto!

857
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,660
Get your ass over her. I got
a cohiba with your name on it.

858
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,662
Alright, for sure, nigga,
I'll be right over.

859
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:16,698
Just between us, Nicky can't
stop talking about you.

860
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,901
I think, he has like,
a little bit of a man crush.

861
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,007
- Bye.
- Bye.

862
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,575
Bye.

863
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,044
What the hell is wrong?
What is this?

864
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,546
Why are you acting like this?

865
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:32,681
- You don't even like these guys.
- I do like them.

866
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,750
Alright.
Tell me when Ingrid gets here,

867
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,785
hey, where's the hat I give you?

868
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,221
- This is the hat you gave me.
- No, it's not.

869
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,490
Okay, look,
that shit was weak, alright?

870
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,226
I'm... I'm in this shirt.
You let me roll up the sleeves,

871
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:46,795
let me get a little bit of Dan
in it, please.

872
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,565
Fine, you can leave on the hat
and go hangout with them

873
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,533
- just don't embarrass me, okay?
- Nigga, I'm gonna go talk

874
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,235
- about some Batman, right now.
- Don't say it.

875
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:55,771
- Alright. Love you!
- Love you.

876
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,775
So, the other day I was
at this tech startup thing.

877
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:03,812
They had the most absurd
art on the wall

878
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,148
- that you have ever seen

879
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,985
and I gotta be honest, it kinda
bugged me a little bit because

880
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,922
it's like, "what statement
are you trying to make?"

881
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,525
Is it that, as a company,

882
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,228
that you're trying to say
that you've good taste?

883
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,098
You know, like,
that's fucking bullshit, man.

884
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,100
- You can't acquire taste.
- Come on!

885
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:28,971
It's something that you have
to earn, you gotta be in pain

886
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:33,609
over it. Do you have something
you'd like to say, Nicky?

887
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,745
- You wanna share with the class?
- I don't think you'd say that

888
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:38,780
if they hung one
of your paintings on the wall.

889
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,787
That... first of all, I would,
because I'm an objective...

890
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:48,056
person. That's not...

891
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,125
And, in fact, it's not what
I'm even talking about.

892
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,060
Abs... absolutely everything
you were talking about.

893
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:53,896
No.
Come on, babe, back me up.

894
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,202
Look, i... I mean,
I kinda agree with Nicky

895
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,672
'cause you always say
that art is subjective.

896
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,041
- Wow.
- What?

897
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,845
- Oh, come on, I was...
- Where are you going?

898
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,747
I was just being honest
with you, man.

899
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:16,051
- Ugh!
- That was uncalled for.

900
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,253
I know what you meant.

901
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,190
So, Nicky tells me
you've a place in Joshua tree.

902
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,793
Oh, my god. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Have you been?

903
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,962
No, but I'm dying to go.

904
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:28,597
Yeah you should, it's amazing.

905
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:31,266
I've been thinking of doing
a pop up out there.

906
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:32,968
For our resort collection.

907
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,939
- Wait. Can I tell you a secret?
- Uh-uh.

908
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,207
Okay.
I presume it sounds crazy,

909
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,644
but my biggest dream is to buy
the house that's next door to us

910
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:44,079
and turn it to
this boutique hotel.

911
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,049
- Where everything in it is for sale.
- Oh, nice. Yeah, and I was gonna

912
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,785
- call it "desert door."
- Love it.

913
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,219
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

914
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:53,121
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, just go over there.

915
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,356
- Hey!
- Hi.

916
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,024
Do you guys need help
with anything?

917
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,127
No. No, I actually think
that we're fine in here.

918
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,829
- Cool.
- Yeah.

919
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:04,933
Oh, my god, I wanted to tell you
that I read<i> the deer park.</i>

920
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,835
The book you're obsessed with?

921
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,338
- Yeah. It's great, isn't it?
- It's so good.

922
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,039
- If you ever want to talk...
- Oh, my god.

923
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,041
Wait! Why don't you and Nicky
just come out next weekend?

924
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:15,744
We'll take you to happy's.
The crowd's a little sketchy,

925
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,713
but they have
the best live music

926
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:19,214
and the greatest desert vibes...

927
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:33,862
Ezra!

928
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:41,737
Hey, have you seen my phone?
Can't find it anywhere.

929
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,905
Nope.

930
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,976
What are you doing?

931
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,314
I want skinny dipping.

932
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,651
Alone?

933
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,921
Yeah.

934
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,029
You okay?

935
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,799
I'm not an artist.

936
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,770
I'm a fucking charlatan.

937
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,773
No, you're not.
Your paintings are awesome.

938
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,675
You're my only sale.

939
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,779
But Taylor said
they were really popular.

940
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,081
She would say that,
wouldn't she? Yeah.

941
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,219
Everything's the best, with her.

942
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,356
"Have you been to this new
restaurant? It's the best!"

943
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:40,195
"Have you tried these...
These new clothes are the best!"

944
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,231
"It's the best! It's the best!
It's the best!"

945
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:46,034
It's not the fucking best.
It's fucking exhausting.

946
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,142
You know what, I actually kind
of know what you mean.

947
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,747
When we were in Joshua tree,
she told me this secret,

948
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:00,248
and she told me
not to tell anyone.

949
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,850
But I walked in
on her telling Harley

950
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,485
the same, exact thing earlier.

951
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,387
What secret?

952
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,459
I mean, obviously,
don't tell her I'm telling you,

953
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:12,227
but, I guess, she has a plan

954
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,229
to buy the house
next door to you guys,

955
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,232
and turn it into some
hotel slash store.

956
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,901
And she wants
to call it "desert door."

957
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,205
- Desert... desert door?
- Yeah.

958
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,276
It's a reference to her favorite
book, you know,<i> the deer park.</i>

959
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,079
<i>The deer park</i>
is my favorite book.

960
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,249
Taylor's never even read it.

961
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,054
I miss the old Taylor.

962
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,124
Back when she first moved here.
She didn't know anybody.

963
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,929
She was like, this total
preppy, sorority chick.

964
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,531
Yeah.

965
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,401
I miss when it was
just the two of us.

966
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,340
I... I'm sorry.
I don't mean to burden you.

967
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:01,209
- No, don't be sorry. It's okay.
- I'm just shit. I'm just...

968
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:03,411
It's not that I don't feel like,
I really...

969
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:05,247
Have anyone
that I can talk to...

970
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,516
- You know.
- Yeah.

971
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,553
Especially with fucking
Nicky around.

972
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,431
Hey! Olga, come on in.

973
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,004
- Nose beer for the lady?
- I'm good.

974
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,242
Yoop, yoop, yoop, yoop, ugh!

975
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,413
- What's up?
- Nicky, where's my phone?

976
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,816
Huh, phone?

977
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:44,886
- Come on. I know you took it.

978
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,589
- Did you?
- You caught me!

979
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,192
Give it back.

980
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,260
No, no.
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay...

981
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,995
- Come on, just give it back.
- Don't...

982
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,932
Reach towards me.
Sit down.

983
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,537
You know, it's...

984
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:07,175
Really funny what you can
discover about someone

985
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,277
by just...
Going through their phone.

986
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,981
Oh, here.
Look, this is a...

987
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:18,353
A picture of you
in my sister's bathroom. Weird.

988
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,923
Here's a picture
of her medicine cabinet.

989
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,092
Here is a picture
of her sleeping.

990
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,560
There are a lot of those.
That's...

991
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:28,496
Those are just a joke.
We were messing around.

992
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,532
Actually, my favorite things

993
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,467
are the notes.
So you have...

994
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,437
Taylor's favorite brunch spot,
Taylor's favorite books,

995
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:37,138
Taylor's favorite movie posters.

996
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,580
- Why are you...
- Sit the fuck down!

997
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,944
Sit the fuck down.

998
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,189
- What do you want?
- Me?

999
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,158
Nothing. No, I'm... I'm just
looking out for my sister.

1000
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,162
What do you want?

1001
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,566
Look, I'm not
a psychopath or anything.

1002
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,968
I just... want to be her friend.

1003
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,571
Come on.
Your password to your phone

1004
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,339
is my sister's birthday,
for fuck's sake.

1005
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,475
That's like,
<i>"single. White, female"</i> shit.

1006
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,211
Look, I just moved here.
I don't know anyone,

1007
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,513
and Taylor's been so nice to me

1008
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,917
telling me all
the best places to go...

1009
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,219
I'm not doing anything wrong.

1010
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,022
- Okay? So please don't tell her.
- Sorry, all good. But this is...

1011
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,492
It's just too good to let go.
I mean...

1012
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,428
You're fucked.

1013
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,266
I'm gonna make a deal with you.

1014
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:40,502
I'm not gonna give you
your phone back.

1015
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:45,307
But I'm willing
to rent it out to you.

1016
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,409
For a very small fee.

1017
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,079
- How much?
- Five thousand a month.

1018
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,950
Disco Dan told me about your mom
and the sack full of cash.

1019
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,118
Fucking ridiculous.
I don't have that kind of money.

1020
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,688
- Okay, Taylor!
- Don't do that, please don't.

1021
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,456
- Just...
- Oh.

1022
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,526
You're ready to make
a deal then?

1023
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,698
Five thousand a month,
and I won't tell her

1024
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,733
how much of a fucking loser
you are.

1025
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,636
I'll give you five thousand,
that's it.

1026
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:18,206
You don't have any room
to negotiate. I own you.

1027
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,111
Fine.

1028
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,548
Good.
So tomorrow night,

1029
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,583
we'll meet at the whole foods
parking lot.

1030
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,152
Gives you twenty-four hours
to get the cash.

1031
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,188
And don't worry
about deleting anything.

1032
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,256
I already forwarded
all the good stuff to myself.

1033
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,492
Oh! This is my favorite part
of the song.

1034
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,075
- Fucking dainty flower.
- Oh, my god

1035
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:29,110
- what the hell's in that?
- You look really cool

1036
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:30,578
- with that piece of shit.

1037
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,549
What are you, a Barbie doll?

1038
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,652
'Cause you got
fucking ripped off.

1039
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,734
I don't need to know how much
you paid for that shit.

1040
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:42,791
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

1041
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,826
Yeah.

1042
01:07:44,828 --> 01:07:48,363
I'll give one of you 200 bucks
if you punch me in the face.

1043
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,334
- I'm serious.
- Fuck off.

1044
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,537
Oh, okay.
It's cool.

1045
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,505
Yeah, that's fine.
If you pussies can't handle it,

1046
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:59,407
that's fine. I'll find
someone else who can.

1047
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,478
Dude, come on.

1048
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,647
- Alright, fuck it. I will do it.
- What?

1049
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:09,184
- I said I'll do it.
- Okay, great.

1050
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,154
- Oh, yeah!
- Where's the money?

1051
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,733
- You sure about this, right?
- Yeah.

1052
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,470
As hard as you can.

1053
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:30,538
Punch me.
Really hard, right in the face.

1054
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,608
- Fucking...
- Oh, shoot!

1055
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,677
Shut up!

1056
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,279
- Oh, shit.

1057
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:39,827
You got fucked up.

1058
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,718
Alright, I need to know what
happened. I mean, every detail.

1059
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,221
When I got home,
I turned the lights on

1060
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:47,689
and Nicky was there.
I swear to god.

1061
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:49,791
He was sitting there
and he was waiting for me,

1062
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,426
and he was fucked up on...

1063
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:54,162
Drugs or drug or something,
I don't know.

1064
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:55,530
And I asked him
for my phone back

1065
01:08:55,532 --> 01:08:56,798
and he wouldn't give it
back to me.

1066
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,766
And then he said
he wanted $50,000.

1067
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,602
- Fifty thousand?
- Yes!

1068
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,271
I told him that I didn't have
that kind of money,

1069
01:09:03,273 --> 01:09:04,772
but he said that...

1070
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,209
He said you told him
about the money my mom gave me.

1071
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:09,145
- Is that true?

1072
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,514
I don't know.
We were drinking this shitty...

1073
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,682
He kept asking me
fucking question.

1074
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,384
Damn! Why the fuck
would you do that?

1075
01:09:16,386 --> 01:09:19,354
- I told you how dangerous he is.
- It doesn't sound like Nick.

1076
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,556
Okay. Well,
you've known him for one day.

1077
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,758
- So how would you know?
- I don't know...

1078
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,928
I've seen him do dirt, we were
supposed to go to six flags.

1079
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,631
Argh. Fuck.
We gotta call him.

1080
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:30,798
- We gotta call him.
- No.

1081
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,267
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Don't call him.

1082
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:33,768
- We gotta call him.
- Don't call him.

1083
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,671
He told me if I told anyone,
he would kill me.

1084
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,965
I don't give a shit. You don't
know what he's capable of.

1085
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,308
I don't give a fuck, Ingrid!

1086
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,944
Look at your face!
What am I supposed to do?

1087
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,547
Shh. Look... shh.

1088
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,919
We need to be smart
about this, okay?

1089
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,256
I need you to be Batman.

1090
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,926
I am Batman.

1091
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,929
We won't kill this dude, right?

1092
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:04,332
No. No. We're just
gonna scare him a little bit.

1093
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:05,821
We're going to take him
out to the desert and

1094
01:10:05,846 --> 01:10:07,535
you're gonna tell him if
he doesn't leave me alone,

1095
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,704
- you're gonna fucking kill him.
- What if he calls the police.

1096
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,439
- No, no.
- If he calls the police...

1097
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,374
- Nah, this shit just seems sca...
- Hey!

1098
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,810
Keep it together.
I thought you were Batman.

1099
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,413
I am Batman.
Batman don't do shit like this.

1100
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:21,316
I arrest people,
take them to Arkham asylum,

1101
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,384
they possibly get out
a few months later

1102
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,320
and the cycle continues.
All right?

1103
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:27,222
He deserves this.
You saw my bruise.

1104
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,357
- He fucked me up.

1105
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:33,528
That's right.
He... he fucking hit you.

1106
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,868
Tupac said,
"it'll be days like this".

1107
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,304
- All right, let's...
- Wait.

1108
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:49,711
Love you.

1109
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:09,831
Don't move.

1110
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,767
Did you guys think this through?

1111
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,003
To tell you the truth,
I don't think you did.

1112
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,272
'Cause this should be
behind the back.

1113
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,606
Just pointing it out.

1114
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:22,577
Sad, but, um, don't worry.
I'm good. I'm gonna stay down.

1115
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:25,580
You know what,
I'm just thinking about this.

1116
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:28,349
Who would really want
to kidnap me?

1117
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:35,590
Ah, there's not many people
except maybe, um... Olga.

1118
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,328
Olga, is that you?
Who you got helping ya?

1119
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,031
Hello?

1120
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,401
I never knew I get car sick.

1121
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,836
Well, I never had
a bag on my head.

1122
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:50,905
- Shut the fuck up.
- Gentle.

1123
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,510
Oh, shit, really?
God, is this necessary?

1124
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:58,780
Listen!
Leave Ingrid Thorburn

1125
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,415
- the fuck alone.
- Okay, come on.

1126
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:01,683
- Do you understand?
- Come on, baby,

1127
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:03,351
- you can do this.
- This is a fucking warning!

1128
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,913
You know this bag
is see through, right?

1129
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,756
Fuck!

1130
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,588
W-wait. No, no, no, no, no.
Don't shoot me.

1131
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,791
Why the fuck you didn't stop?

1132
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,563
I can kill you. You drag me out
to the fucking desert

1133
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:51,099
- with a fucking paintball gun.

1134
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:58,806
Stop!

1135
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,170
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

1136
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,906
<i>Um, this is gonna sound weird,</i>

1137
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,675
<i>but have you heard
from Nicky at all?</i>

1138
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:37,412
No, why?
Is everything all right?

1139
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,968
<i>Not really. We haven't
heardfrom him since yesterday.</i>

1140
01:13:39,993 --> 01:13:41,482
<i>I think his phone may be dead.</i>

1141
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:43,050
Maybe he flew back to Paris.

1142
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,720
<i>Yeah. Yeah, maybe.</i>

1143
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,090
<i>I don't know.
I'm just worried about him.</i>

1144
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:50,725
I'm sure he's fine.

1145
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,495
But... do you wanna grab
a coffee and talk about it?

1146
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,197
<i>No, I can't right now.</i>

1147
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:59,066
<i>Shit. Sorry, my mom's
calling me. I gotta go.</i>

1148
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:00,835
- Okay. Well I'm at...

1149
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:28,463
<i>Last minute escape
to J. Tree. Hashtag, blue.</i>

1150
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:44,645
Hello?

1151
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,657
<i>It's five o'clock somewhere.</i>

1152
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:16,944
<i>Hello.</i>

1153
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,613
Hey.

1154
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,549
Wasn't expecting you.
Where are you guys?

1155
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:24,051
- <i>We're at dinner.</i>
- Oh, cool. Um...

1156
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:25,620
Yeah so, it's so weird.

1157
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,021
I know you guys
were in Joshua tree

1158
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,856
and actually here, randomly,
on a yoga retreat.

1159
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,291
- So I figured we could all...
- <i>we're not</i>

1160
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,592
<i>in Joshua tree.</i>

1161
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,830
- You're not?
- <i>Taylor doesn't wanna</i>

1162
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,064
<i>see you anymore.</i>

1163
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:41,103
Put Taylor on the phone.

1164
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:44,138
<i>She doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

1165
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,710
Okay.
Um...

1166
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,682
Should I call back tomorrow?
Is that a better time, maybe?

1167
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:58,286
<i>Nicky told us everything
about the phone, the kidnapping.</i>

1168
01:15:58,288 --> 01:15:59,987
<i>If he hadn't tried
to blackmail you,</i>

1169
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,156
<i>you'd be in jail right now.
You understand?</i>

1170
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,258
- Ezra, wait.
- <i>Don't call here again.</i>

1171
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,826
- Hello?

1172
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:16,037
<i>Hey.
You've reached Taylor.</i>

1173
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,638
<i>- Leave a message.</i>

1174
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:22,610
Hey, it's Ingrid. So I just had
the weirdest call with Ezra.

1175
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:25,813
And I just feel like,
we should talk about this.

1176
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,848
I don't know what
Nicky told you guys,

1177
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,918
but the fact is,
he's definitely lying.

1178
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,588
I mean, he was probably
drunk or something, so...

1179
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,724
I don't know,
but it sounded so insane.

1180
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,826
So just call me back
so we can talk about it.

1181
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:42,296
Okay. Please call me back.
It's Ingrid.

1182
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,068
<i>Hey. You've reached
Taylor. Leave a message.</i>

1183
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,670
Hey! Me again.

1184
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:53,708
Um, haven't heard back
so I'm starting to worry.

1185
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,209
I mean, this isn't like you.

1186
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:58,312
Call me back, okay?
Okay.

1187
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,884
<i>Hey. You've reached
Taylor. Leave a message.</i>

1188
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:06,120
Hey, it's me, again.

1189
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,289
Remember me, Ingrid?

1190
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,325
Ingrid, patron of the arts.
Ingrid, with the truck.

1191
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:13,027
Ingrid, who saved
your fucking dog's life.

1192
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:15,696
The least you can do is pick up
your fucking phone, you bitch.

1193
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,969
<i>Hey. You've reached
Taylor. Leave a message.</i>

1194
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,772
Hey, it's me.

1195
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,108
I was totally kidding

1196
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:30,011
about all those messages
that I just left.

1197
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,913
It was a joke.
Gotcha.

1198
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:37,184
Yes, I'm so angry at you.
It's me, Ingrid, I'm mean.

1199
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,955
I'm just kidding. So...

1200
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,859
Anyway, I'm gonna be around
probably for another hour.

1201
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,028
So I have one more thing to do.
So give me a call.

1202
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:51,098
Oh, my god,
that's you calling in. Hello?

1203
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,234
<i>Listen to me, you psycho.</i>

1204
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:55,903
<i>If you don't stop this shit
right fucking now</i>

1205
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:58,172
<i>I'm calling the fucking cops.
Do you understand?</i>

1206
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:02,343
<i>- It's three in the fucking morning.
- Just leave us the fuck alone.</i>

1207
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:11,018
<i>The voicemail box
you're trying to reach is full</i>

1208
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:13,454
<i>and cannot accept new messages.
Goodbye.</i>

1209
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:17,058
Oh, no. No.

1210
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:28,936
You okay, miss?

1211
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:31,072
I'm fine.

1212
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:34,475
Oh, okay. Well, it's pretty hot out today.
You might want to get out of your car

1213
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:36,310
- and get inside, you know...
- I said I'm fine.

1214
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:39,180
Okay, alright.
Whatever you say.

1215
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,922
You see that house over there...

1216
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:52,793
<i>Twenty-two,
flamingo Lane.</i>

1217
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,902
Which piece of property
is it you're interested in?

1218
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,139
- Twenty-two, flamingo Lane.
- Okay.

1219
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:07,508
Unfortunately...

1220
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:10,978
The people that live next door,
they already put an offer on it.

1221
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:14,949
No.
I've got several other pieces of property

1222
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,884
I'd be happy to show to you.

1223
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,859
That's $50,000.

1224
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,495
You can count it.

1225
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,165
<i>Sorry, but you must have</i>

1226
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,966
<i>a credit card or checking
account to open an account.</i>

1227
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:08,936
<i>I already have an account.
That belonged to the previous tenant.</i>

1228
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:10,404
<i>- You have to open a new account.</i>

1229
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,406
Can you just, please,
give me one more week?

1230
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:15,209
<i>Ma'am, if you don't open
an account in the next 24 hours,</i>

1231
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,977
<i>we're gonna have
to shut off your power.</i>

1232
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,412
<i>Now, we do offer a payment plan</i>

1233
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,581
<i>for those experiencing
a financial hardship.</i>

1234
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:23,083
Fuck you, okay.
Fuck you, asshole.

1235
01:20:41,236 --> 01:20:43,270
Fuck.
You piece of shit.

1236
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:51,545
Not enough.

1237
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,582
Wanna take something off?

1238
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:58,085
Can't I just have it, man?
Come on, it's Halloween.

1239
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,524
Nah.

1240
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,627
- Fine.

1241
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,001
Oh, fuck.

1242
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:52,439
Come on.

1243
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:59,280
No. Oh, co... come on!
What the fuck!

1244
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:02,016
Goddamn it!

1245
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:52,066
So, I got a job back east

1246
01:22:52,068 --> 01:22:54,068
and actually we will end up
selling the house.

1247
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:57,638
Yeah. It's gonna be
a concept designer for Levi's.

1248
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,008
Well, that's the opportunity.

1249
01:23:04,714 --> 01:23:06,680
Watch it, fucking dick!

1250
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,516
Ingrid?

1251
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,422
I... I literally just saw you.

1252
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,195
Whoo!

1253
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,200
- The fuck is she doing?
- Boo!

1254
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:32,506
Happy Halloween.

1255
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,009
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1256
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,044
No fucking way!
This bitch again?

1257
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:39,580
Piece of shit.
I'm calling the cops.

1258
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:42,016
No, you don't... don't...
You don't have to do that.

1259
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,484
I'm not gonna hurt anyone.

1260
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,286
I'm not gonna do anything. Okay.

1261
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:48,288
I promise. I just needed
to charge my phone.

1262
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,758
You're not welcome here
so get the fuck of my property.

1263
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:53,027
Can we just talk about this?

1264
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:54,762
I literally have nothing
to say to you.

1265
01:23:54,764 --> 01:23:56,630
Please, just give me
five minutes. Okay?

1266
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,165
And I promise that
I'll leave you alone.

1267
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,768
I just...
I just wanna talk about it.

1268
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,170
- Let me handle this, okay.
- No, it's fine, baby.

1269
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:05,139
- It's okay.
- Okay, it's fine. You got it.

1270
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,107
Five minutes. That's it.

1271
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,380
Okay.
Come on.

1272
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:24,658
Okay, are you going to say
what you wanted to say?

1273
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,227
Why are you acting like that?

1274
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,064
It's just me, Ingrid.

1275
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,736
I'm sorry. Are you...
Are you actually insane?

1276
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:39,106
'Cause you do know Nicky almost
died because of you, right?

1277
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,444
I thought we were friends.

1278
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,647
- We had so much fun together.
- Oh, my god.

1279
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:50,284
Ingrid...
We were never friends

1280
01:24:50,286 --> 01:24:53,187
because everything
about you is such a fucking lie.

1281
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:56,723
You just are some weird freak
that found me on Instagram.

1282
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:58,826
And that's basically
all this has been.

1283
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:04,598
Everything about me is a lie.
Okay, well...

1284
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,834
- What?
- Everything about you

1285
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:08,569
is a fucking lie. Okay.

1286
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,271
- It is.
- Okay.

1287
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:13,307
Your brother is a drug addict.

1288
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:16,243
Your husband is an alcoholic
who fucking hates you.

1289
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,147
And you pretend to be
some cool L.A. chick,

1290
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:21,548
but you're full of shit.

1291
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,551
Ezra told me everything, okay.
He told me that

1292
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:27,287
when you moved here,
you were lame and basic,

1293
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:28,722
and you had no friends.

1294
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,494
You were just like me.

1295
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:40,767
You know what, Ingrid, um...

1296
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:46,740
I was, uh,
actually never like you...

1297
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:52,646
Because you are
a sad and pathetic,

1298
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,815
and very sick person,

1299
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,485
and you need professional help.

1300
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:05,692
Game over.

1301
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:11,632
Forgot something.

1302
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,191
Phew!
Sorry about that, everyone.

1303
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:40,394
- Everything's okay.
- Everything's cool.

1304
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:51,972
Hey guys! It's me, Ingrid.

1305
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:55,776
I've never done
this before, but...

1306
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,845
I didn't have
anyone else to talk to

1307
01:26:58,847 --> 01:27:00,781
so I figured, why not.

1308
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,485
I just wanted
to tell you guys that...

1309
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,922
Basically everything I've posted

1310
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:11,925
in the last couple of months
is a total lie.

1311
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:17,297
I haven't been living, some
like, glamorous life in L.A.

1312
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,434
I'm just...

1313
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,770
A loser.

1314
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:27,841
I'm pathetic.

1315
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,747
And I know
there's something wrong with me,

1316
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:36,483
but I don't know how to fix it,

1317
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,752
and I don't know how to change.

1318
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,290
And I just...
Don't think I can change.

1319
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,025
So maybe I'm just...

1320
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,495
Maybe this is just who I am.

1321
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,431
And maybe I'm just tired...

1322
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,333
Of trying to make people
like me.

1323
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:56,436
I'm tired of pretending like,
someone I'm not.

1324
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:58,772
And I'm tired of being alone.

1325
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,040
And I'm just...

1326
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:04,344
Just tired of being me so...

1327
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,513
I just...

1328
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:08,949
Feel like...

1329
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,721
If you don't have anyone
to share anything with,

1330
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,556
then what'd the point of living?

1331
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:22,596
Yeah, so I guess
I'm just making this video...

1332
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:26,700
So you guys can see the real me.
At least once.

1333
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:31,805
So here I am.

1334
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:56,656
<i>Ingrid.</i>

1335
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:59,126
Ingrid.

1336
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,663
Ingrid. Ingrid.

1337
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:06,032
Ingrid can you hear me?

1338
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,835
There she is.

1339
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,039
Where's my phone?

1340
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:16,543
Take it easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1341
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,546
Take it easy.
You've been through a lot.

1342
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:23,517
It's okay.

1343
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,153
What all that stuff?

1344
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:28,755
Apparently, you've got
a lot of fans out there.

1345
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:34,561
As a matter of fact,
one of them is here to see you.

1346
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:39,666
Hey, wassup, Ingrid?

1347
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,636
Dan's the reason
you're still with us.

1348
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,872
He saw your video online
and called 911.

1349
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:49,976
- You're a lucky girl.
- Batman to the rescue.

1350
01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:52,579
The usual.

1351
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,451
Can you give us a minute?

1352
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,620
Like the new whip?

1353
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:02,189
I know, I'm shining.

1354
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:03,924
This is not the Batmobile,
but it'll do.

1355
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,059
I asked for black, but...

1356
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,628
- They... they out of black.

1357
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:13,834
I like it.

1358
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:19,039
Baby, where did you go?
Why did... why did you leave?

1359
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:23,143
I mean, are you going
to disappear on me again

1360
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:25,011
in another three weeks?

1361
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:30,517
Yeah, yeah.

1362
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,854
How you feeling?

1363
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,524
- I feel stupid.
- Oh, come on, don't say that.

1364
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:39,025
Why so serious?

1365
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:45,031
Come on,
nobody wants to see this.

1366
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,803
Okay.
I know what'll cheer you up.

1367
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,673
Oh, I'm fine. By the way.

1368
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:59,646
Take a look. Go ahead.

1369
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:04,684
Your little suicide video
went viral.

1370
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,288
Your face is all over
the Internet.

1371
01:32:10,224 --> 01:32:14,661
Look at them.
Thousands, and thousands

1372
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:16,763
and thousands.

1373
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:19,966
You're an inspiration, babe.

1374
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,969
You have a hashtag.

1375
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,840
Hashtag I am Ingrid.

1376
01:32:26,856 --> 01:32:27,875
<i>Feel better soon.</i>

1377
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:31,011
<i>- Praying for your recovery.
- amazing.</i>

1378
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,856
<i>You're too good to do that
to yourself. I gotta tell you,</i>

1379
01:32:42,858 --> 01:32:44,558
<i>- you're fucking beautiful.
- you're a hero.</i>

1380
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,825
<i>Hashtag I am Ingrid.</i>
