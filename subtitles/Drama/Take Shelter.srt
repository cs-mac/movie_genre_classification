1
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,200
No, no, no.
Don't feed the dog, darling.

2
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,000
Thanks, babe.

3
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,711
- You slept late.
- Yeah, I need to go.

4
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,129
What you got going today?

5
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,466
I've got to finish up some
curtains for Saturday...

6
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,927
... and Nat and Cam
are coming over.

7
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,470
- With the kids?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,430
Cammie said she just needed
to get out of the house.

9
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,599
Tell Nat to take it easy on her.

10
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,476
Cam can hold her own.

11
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,312
We need to send in the deposit
for the beach condo.

12
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,897
I love you.

13
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,029
- Just write the check, babe, okay?
- Okay, bye.

14
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,079
No more food.

15
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,331
You, eat.

16
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,206
Yeah, let's keep going
with that bit.

17
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,791
It'll go another 10 feet.

18
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,460
We won't get the gravel
pack down today.

19
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,795
Why not?

20
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,548
Clouds.

21
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,634
We're gonna have to call it.

22
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,970
Happy hour
starts at 5:00, Dewart.

23
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,723
Not if it's raining.

24
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,727
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,565
They were just drinking
and laughing.

26
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,235
And, oh, my God, it was like
I was being in a museum...

27
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,156
... and I saw the progress
from apes to men.

28
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,701
I saw it.
I saw the future.

29
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,497
Dewart, that was him, that was
going to be him in 20 years.

30
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,251
Let me tell you, you laugh.

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,073
You laugh. But this
little one in your arms...

32
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,173
... is gonna be shuffling
in a bar just like them.

33
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,134
- Yep.
- No.

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,886
Don't listen to her.

35
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,471
- Hannah!
- What?

36
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,562
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

37
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,691
No.
Don't touch.

38
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,319
You understand?

39
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,116
Okay.
Come here.

40
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,039
Go play.

41
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,316
Hey, DJ.
Bring the girls inside.

42
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,040
What?

43
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,294
- It's not my fault. I told you.
- Yeah, all right.

44
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,257
All right, I'm calling it.
Shut it down.

45
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,114
Bye, guys.
Thank you for coming.

46
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:48,514
I'll call you about
the Lions Club supper.

47
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,932
- Okay. Love you.
- Bye, Sam.

48
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,434
Bye, Cam!

49
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,792
Can you sign...

50
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,132
... S-T-O-R-M?

51
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,639
Storm.

52
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,629
I gotta get home.

53
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,393
Nat and me been
looking into a threesome.

54
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,610
We've been chatting with
this girl online from Canton.

55
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,904
Yeah.
Big old girl.

56
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,118
What's big?

57
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,662
She's about 250, 275.

58
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,747
She can't be no taller
than five foot.

59
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,712
Shit, man.

60
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,844
I don't see me and Sam
getting into something like that.

61
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,054
No, I don't guess you would.

62
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,561
You got a good life, Curtis.

63
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,312
I'm serious.

64
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,568
I think that's the best compliment
you can give a man.

65
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,113
Take a look at his life
and say, "That's good.

66
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,074
"That guy's doing
something right."

67
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,745
Well, it ain't always so easy.

68
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,747
Hell, I know that.

69
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,003
Oh, shit.
I gotta go.

70
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,052
Good night.

71
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,273
Hey, baby.

72
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,697
She do all right today?

73
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:36,951
She was fine.

74
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,080
She's still not playing
with the others, though.

75
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,790
She can't connect.

76
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,627
Honey, you gotta clean up
that trash pile in the back.

77
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,047
She fished out a board
that had nails on it.

78
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,468
I'll get to it this weekend.

79
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,852
I still take off my boots,
so I won't wake her up.

80
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,023
I still whisper.

81
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,794
Curtis?

82
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,630
- What?
- Did you hear me?

83
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,942
You gotta be home,
showered...

84
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:57,842
... ready to walk out
the door by 6:00 tonight.

85
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,511
What's wrong?

86
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,515
Nothing. I just want her
to eat her breakfast...

87
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,015
... and stop playing
with the damn dog.

88
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,558
She's fine down there.
She had toast already.

89
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:07,851
- All right.
- What?

90
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,436
Hannah.
Come here. Hannah.

91
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,021
- Curtis?
- What?

92
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,153
I'm late.

93
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,323
- You didn't eat anything.
- It's okay.

94
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,331
I didn't say you had control
over the weather, Russell.

95
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:34,461
What I did say was that the top shelf
has got to be cleared by the 15th.

96
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,797
That's non-negotiable.

97
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,341
Curtis?

98
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,594
Curtis? Where we at
on that East 82nd site?

99
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,132
Yesterday slowed us down.

100
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:46,932
We couldn't get the second
pilot hole drilled.

101
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,060
It rained for
two hours yesterday.

102
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:54,356
Two hours, and our entire
schedule went in the toilet?

103
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,859
We lose the permit if you're
not out of there, end of day.

104
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,445
- Yes, sir.
- End of day, Curtis.

105
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,074
All right. Valerie tells me that
the father-son pancake cook-off...

106
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,954
Hey, I gotta make a stop
before we head out there.

107
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,748
- Think we got time?
- Yeah, there's time.

108
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,585
Shit.

109
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,063
Son of a bitch.

110
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,232
- We stripped that bit.
- Yeah.

111
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,611
Well, bring it up.
We gotta reset it.

112
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,487
Curtis!

113
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,380
- You ever see birds fly like that?
- What?

114
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,856
Damn it.

115
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,569
Come on, we gotta go.

116
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,571
Jesus.

117
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,324
Honey, I can really
use a shower.

118
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,665
Hi.

119
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,878
So if you continue with the basic
vocabulary, this will allow you...

120
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,048
... to communicate
with your children better.

121
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,884
Between the ages
of four and seven...

122
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,262
... the focus is more on the sign.

123
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,557
And then later, we'll begin
adding the alphabet...

124
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,767
... as more of a support system.

125
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:41,273
Now, in ASL, the male sign
is signed at the forehead area.

126
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,526
For example, "father,"
is signed up here like this.

127
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,695
Father.
Very good.

128
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,588
- You're not sorry.
- I am sorry.

129
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,884
Well, you stink.
You smell really bad.

130
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,643
I think I smell good.

131
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,109
Do I smell good?

132
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,658
See? Maybe I should
marry her instead.

133
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,326
Stop.

134
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,922
Oh, man.

135
00:16:58,768 --> 00:16:59,768
You okay?

136
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,577
Shit!

137
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,431
You okay?

138
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,727
You're okay.

139
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,314
It's okay.

140
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,615
No!

141
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,655
Hannah!

142
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,755
Hannah!

143
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,098
Here, honey.
Put on your shoes.

144
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,725
- Good, you're up.
- Yeah.

145
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,269
Honey, you're soaked.

146
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,356
I've felt better.

147
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,110
I guess we can stay home
if we need to.

148
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,654
Where are you going?

149
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,698
It's Saturday. I was gonna
take Hannah to my booth.

150
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,158
Oh, yeah.

151
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,120
You look really sick, honey.

152
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,916
I'm all right.
It's just a cold or something.

153
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,293
Let me get you some Advil.

154
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,712
No, don't worry about it.
Just go. I'll be fine.

155
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,339
You sure?

156
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,299
Better already.

157
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,554
Okay. I got my phone
if you need anything.

158
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,556
Don't forget, Sunday lunch
is here tomorrow.

159
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,142
If you're sick, we should cancel.

160
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,144
I'll be all right.

161
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,147
Okay, we'll talk later.

162
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,235
Come on.
Let's go.

163
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,446
- You sure?
- Honey, please.

164
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,475
How much you asking
for this pillow?

165
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,729
This pillow is $15.

166
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,480
That's more than
I want to spend.

167
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,108
This is all hand stitched.
It takes a really long time.

168
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,484
That's why I charge that.

169
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,195
I'll give you $7 for it.

170
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,989
I can't go that low.

171
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,325
Well, that's my offer.

172
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,165
How about 10?

173
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,170
I'll give you $8,
but it's in change.

174
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,884
That's fine. Lucky for you
she likes to count change.

175
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,136
Red.

176
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,181
Come on.

177
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,350
Get in.
Good boy.

178
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,276
I'm sorry about this, buddy.

179
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,739
We just gotta work it like this
for a while, okay?

180
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:06,954
While rescue workers
made several attempts...

181
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:09,154
... to reach the family,
Walter Jacobs' wife...

182
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,116
- ... and brother-in-law died.
- That's what I don't understand.

183
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,370
If he didn't do anything,
why did you put him out back?

184
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,457
What?

185
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,501
Did you hear me?

186
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,839
I said if he didn't do anything, why
did you have to put him outside?

187
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,425
I just wanted him
to be outside for a while.

188
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,595
He's your dog.
He's always been an inside dog.

189
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,389
He's my dog,
that's why he's outside.

190
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,853
Look...

191
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,834
... right now with Hannah
and everything...

192
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,334
... I just think it'd be better.

193
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,112
- Hannah loves Red.
- Hold on.

194
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,491
The gas cloud spread across
their six-acre property.

195
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,035
The only way off their land
was across the train tracks...

196
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,246
... which were blocked
by wreckage.

197
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,790
I tried using some wet rags and
some towels to breathe through...

198
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,877
... but that just seemed
to make it worse.

199
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,547
While rescue workers made
several attempts to reach the family...

200
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,176
... Walter Jacobs' wife and
brother-in-law died in the home.

201
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,848
Jacobs survived despite enduring
11 hours of exposure to the gas cloud...

202
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
You hearing this?

203
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,602
It's awful.

204
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,188
Eleven hours.

205
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,941
No way out.

206
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,926
Hannah.

207
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,083
Hey!

208
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:15,523
Hey!

209
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,703
Hey, hey!

210
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,184
- Babe?
- Yeah?

211
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,688
You got the number
for Dr. Shannan?

212
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,481
You're still not feeling good?

213
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,775
Yeah, we got the number?

214
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,819
Yeah, baby,
but he'll be closed today.

215
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,196
Right.
Yeah, I'll call tomorrow.

216
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,656
Honey, if you're not
feeling good...

217
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,075
- ... we got to take you...
- No. Stop!

218
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,413
Okay.

219
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,333
Do you want me
to cancel lunch today?

220
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,500
Shit.

221
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,753
- What is that?
- I'm sorry.

222
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,339
I'm sorry.
I just...

223
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,886
I got a sore throat.
I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you.

224
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,014
I was gonna leave Hannah with
you so I could go to church...

225
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,599
... but I'm not gonna
with you like this.

226
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,850
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

227
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,269
- No. She needs breakfast.
- I got it.

228
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,647
I'm sorry that you feel bad,
but you need to drop the attitude.

229
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,526
Come on.
Just go.

230
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,239
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

231
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,574
Just go.

232
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,915
Hannah's in the den.
We have cereal for her.

233
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:01,864
We're going out.

234
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,244
We're going out.
Okay?

235
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,663
It's okay.
It's okay.

236
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,515
You stay put, okay?

237
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,542
Let's just start.

238
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,879
Let's all join hands
for the blessing.

239
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,518
- Where the hell have you been?
- I know. I'm sorry.

240
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,518
I had to run an errand.

241
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,810
- You're really late.
- I know.

242
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,563
You didn't even bring
your cell phone.

243
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,200
Missed you at church
this morning, Curtis.

244
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,244
Dad.

245
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,539
He knows what to do
if he wants me to stop asking.

246
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,875
Was it a good service?

247
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,586
It was.
It was good work.

248
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,719
I'm thinking about cleaning up
that storm shelter out back.

249
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:09,904
Curtis?

250
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,536
- Curtis, how are you doing, bud?
- Hey, Doc.

251
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,455
- How's my girl?
- She is good.

252
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,457
That's good to hear.
Tilt your head back for me.

253
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,501
I don't have a cold.

254
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:27,296
- Did she get that down wrong?
- No, I just told her that.

255
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,341
So what's the problem?

256
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,719
I've been having...

257
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,597
... I've been having
some trouble sleeping.

258
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,058
I was hoping you could
give me something for it.

259
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,394
How long's this been going on?

260
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,396
About four nights now.

261
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,147
You're not sleeping at all?

262
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,441
Well, some, but real restless.

263
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,822
Well, I think four nights
is a little too soon to tell.

264
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:56,534
My advice would be to not eat
or drink anything after 8:00 at night.

265
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,788
Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
tobacco, caffeine.

266
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,666
Get some daily exercise.

267
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,960
Well, I think...

268
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,607
I think I might need
to try some medication.

269
00:34:10,608 --> 00:34:11,607
Why do you say that?

270
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,331
The reason I've been
having trouble sleeping...

271
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:18,931
... is these dreams
I've been having.

272
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:24,687
I didn't think it was anything at first,
but then the other day I woke up...

273
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,567
... and the bed was wet.

274
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,987
- You urinated in your bed?
- Yeah.

275
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,825
Couple of days before that, I had
a dream that my dog attacked me...

276
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,328
... and it took all day for
the pain in my arm to go away.

277
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,161
You been out to see
your mother lately?

278
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:53,424
It's been about a month.

279
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,759
Okay.

280
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,647
Okay. This is a prescription
for a pretty mild sedative.

281
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,815
It's non-habit forming...

282
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,401
... but I'm only giving you
enough for a few days anyway.

283
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,404
Take it and see if it helps.
In the meantime...

284
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,833
... this is the number of a good
friend of mine in Columbus.

285
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,033
He's a psychiatrist.

286
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,578
It's a drive,
but he's the best I know.

287
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,165
Okay.

288
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,503
I'll give him a call and let him
know you'll be down to see him.

289
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,213
All right.

290
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,481
- Hey, Dewart.
- What you say, Curtis?

291
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,857
Not much.

292
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,944
They want us to get
a pilot hole drilled by lunch.

293
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,821
I figure worse comes to worse,
we can eat on the rig.

294
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,823
Yeah, we'll get it done.
Weekend all right?

295
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,241
Yeah, same old shit.

296
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,964
No. No, I need the name
of the specialist...

297
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:06,664
... whose diagnosis you'll accept.

298
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,669
No. Look it,
I've told you this twice. Please.

299
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,839
Just get me the name
and/or the approval code.

300
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,758
Okay.

301
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,764
All right.
And the phone? All right.

302
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,893
Great.
Well, thank you very much.

303
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,021
All right, this is the name and the
phone number of the specialist...

304
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,023
... who the insurance
company approves of.

305
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,984
Just call and make
an appointment.

306
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,027
Now if this doctor signs off...

307
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,780
... you should have the implant
procedure fully covered.

308
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,408
I'm sorry it took so long.

309
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,037
Can I give you a hug?

310
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,873
It's fine.
It's fine.

311
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,594
You know,
your husband's company...

312
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:53,294
... actually has very good
insurance when it kicks in.

313
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,131
Not a lot of jobs offer
policies half as good.

314
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:57,131
You're very lucky.

315
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,641
That's okay.
We have your insurance on file.

316
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,519
- That'll be $47.64.
- What's the co-pay?

317
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,396
That is your co-pay.

318
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,622
Hey.

319
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,426
I love you.

320
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,929
I love you too.

321
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,102
I have good news.

322
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,568
Green?
How about a red?

323
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,373
It was like talking
to a sane person for once.

324
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,544
She made one phone call.
That's it.

325
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,715
I've been trying that 800
number for weeks. You.

326
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,927
It's great.
It's great.

327
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,430
Hey, Hannah.

328
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,732
Are you excited, huh?
We're gonna get you some help.

329
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,527
How do you say,
sign, "excited"?

330
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,945
Like this.

331
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,407
Excited?
Yeah?

332
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,621
All right.
What have we got here?

333
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,456
I got to do you.

334
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,710
Honey, look at this one.

335
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:03,090
It's a 2-1, and it sits
directly on the beach.

336
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:05,351
Wouldn't that be great?

337
00:39:05,352 --> 00:39:07,886
We wouldn't have to worry
about Hannah crossing traffic.

338
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,180
- What's the rent?
- $899 a week.

339
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,393
That sounds real nice.

340
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,459
You sleep well?

341
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,294
Yeah, I did.

342
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,506
You look like
you're feeling better.

343
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,262
You want me to come up
there and do it for you?

344
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,514
Jesus.

345
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,600
Hey, how much food you think
you'd need to live on for a week?

346
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,103
- What do you mean?
- I mean to stay alive.

347
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,438
What do you think you'd need?

348
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:44,108
- Not a lot.
- Yeah? You think?

349
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,442
I don't know.

350
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:50,114
You hear about people living for days
all the time off bark and melted snow.

351
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,201
I've never heard of that.

352
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,994
Shit, I don't know.
You asked the question.

353
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,039
It's on there.

354
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,791
It's on.
Come on.

355
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,884
Damn it.

356
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,728
What?

357
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,722
It sounds like thunder.

358
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,599
What sounds like thunder?

359
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,190
What's the matter
with you, Curtis?

360
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,699
Curtis?

361
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,128
Where are you going?
Curtis, where are you going?

362
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,606
- Curtis.
- Hey, Mom.

363
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,581
- Come in.
- Sure.

364
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,051
I'm gonna get some water.

365
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,570
You want some?

366
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,864
No.

367
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,995
Isn't she lovely?

368
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,506
- Mom?
- Yes?

369
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,759
I need to ask you something.

370
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,847
Do you remember what year
we brought you up here?

371
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,682
To the first place.

372
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,772
It was '86.

373
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,402
Yes. Because Kyle
was going to be a senior.

374
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,531
- I was 10.
- Yes.

375
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:09,331
Can you remember what happened
before you got diagnosed?

376
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,500
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

377
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,712
I just want to know
how it all started.

378
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Before you had to leave.

379
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,133
Oh, I don't know.

380
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,604
I remember it was
a real stressful time.

381
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,319
Your father was gone a lot...

382
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,823
... and I couldn't handle
things on my own.

383
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,953
Did you ever have any...

384
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,248
... dreams?

385
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,250
Like, bad dreams?

386
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,338
No.
Nothing like that.

387
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,255
There was always...

388
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,562
There was always a panic...

389
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,107
... that took hold of me.

390
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,657
I thought people were watching
me and listening to me.

391
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,869
It's all right.
It's fine.

392
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,919
Are you okay?

393
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:41,006
Yeah.

394
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,301
Yeah. I'm fine.

395
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,728
May I have the number
for Dr. George Shannan?

396
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:57,898
Thanks.

397
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,653
Hi, is Dr. Shannan there?

398
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:08,867
May I speak with him?
This is Curtis LaForche.

399
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,747
Hey, Doc.

400
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,169
Yeah, sorry... sorry
to call you at home.

401
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:23,840
I just... I don't think I can make it
to Columbus to see that psychiatrist.

402
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,302
Yeah, it's just too far.

403
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:31,348
Is there somewhere local
you could send me?

404
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:53,954
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

405
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,790
I'm sorry I woke you up.

406
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,543
It's okay.

407
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,296
Where have you been?

408
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,507
I went to see Mom.

409
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,344
Is she okay?

410
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,182
Yeah. I just wanted
to check up on her.

411
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,185
You should have told me,
we would have gone with you.

412
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,853
No, that's okay.

413
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,443
Come to bed.

414
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,738
I will in a bit.

415
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,904
Well, you've kept up with
the payments on the house.

416
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,823
We've been good about that.

417
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,994
I gotta tell you, Curtis, banks aren't
loaning money the way they used to.

418
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,456
We've got you a loan today,
but the interest rates are variable.

419
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,957
We have to tie it
to your house.

420
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,417
That's fine.

421
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,463
Curtis, I've known you
a long time.

422
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,633
Financed your house
for you, two vehicles.

423
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:33,011
I'm telling you,
this is a risky loan you're taking.

424
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,640
I need the money, John.

425
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,226
Okay.

426
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,239
- Hey.
- Hey.

427
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,576
Sorry I left you yesterday.

428
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,914
- Jim came by. I covered for you.
- Thanks.

429
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,810
I need your help
with the depth charts.

430
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:05,510
Sure.

431
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,600
Fucking Nat put me in charge
of frying oysters...

432
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,500
... for that Lions Club supper.

433
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,853
You need another burner?

434
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,940
Yeah, if you still got yours,
I could use it.

435
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:36,866
Hey, you think you could
help me with something?

436
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,118
What do you need?

437
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,588
I'm gonna build out the tornado
shelter in my backyard.

438
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:41,788
I could use some help.

439
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,416
The hell you wanna
do that for?

440
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,669
Just needs to be done.

441
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,340
What do you need?

442
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,845
I figure I'll do it on a Saturday,
borrow some equipment from work.

443
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,058
You sure about that?

444
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,558
Yeah, I just need
a backhoe, a hauler.

445
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,351
I'll rent the rest.

446
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,484
- Yeah. Whatever. I'll help.
- Thanks.

447
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,163
- You all right, man?
- What do you mean?

448
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,085
I just don't wanna
see you fuck up.

449
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,841
I'm not.

450
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,356
Come in.

451
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:54,611
- Hi.
- Hello.

452
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,198
- Have a seat. I'm Kendra.
- Curtis.

453
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,365
Okay.

454
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,453
I'm gonna start by
asking you some questions.

455
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:07,040
Okay. I already answered
all the questions on the form.

456
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,544
Yeah, I know.
I looked at them...

457
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,544
... but I need to get
a profile started on you.

458
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,546
Right.
Well...

459
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,166
Out of the five
possible symptoms...

460
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:21,346
... needed to be diagnosed
with schizophrenia...

461
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,974
... delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech...

462
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,686
... disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms...

463
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,023
... I've had two.

464
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,527
Delusions and hallucinations.

465
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,573
So, I took this quiz
in the back of the book.

466
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:44,994
I scored a five
out of a possible 20.

467
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,081
Schizophrenia starts at 12.
So...

468
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,837
They say it might be
a brief psychotic disorder.

469
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:59,092
Yeah. Whatever it is,
I need to know what to do...

470
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,304
... or what to get on
to get this thing under control.

471
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,810
Look, I'm a counselor.

472
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:13,565
Certified, but I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't prescribe anything to you.

473
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,527
I can talk to you, I can
recommend where to send you...

474
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,112
... but that's it.

475
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:26,828
Now, that said,
if you want to talk, I'll listen.

476
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,416
For a lot of people,
that's a good start.

477
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:36,211
Now you said here that
your mother was diagnosed...

478
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:39,465
... with paranoid schizophrenia
in her 30s.

479
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,967
And you're at 35.

480
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,470
You wanna talk about that?

481
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:51,811
Yeah, I don't know
my mother's symptoms.

482
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,606
I was just 10.

483
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,651
My brother was 17.
And...

484
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,158
I don't know.
She just left me in the car...

485
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,287
... in the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.

486
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,082
And she didn't come back.

487
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,422
And then they found her
a week later...

488
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,842
... eating trash out of a dumpster
in Northern Kentucky.

489
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:27,805
My dad had to put her in the
State Hospital in Columbus.

490
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,685
And she's been in
assisted living ever since.

491
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,483
Yep.

492
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,486
My dad raised me.

493
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,156
He died last April.

494
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,162
So tell me about these dreams.

495
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,431
I don't know what
our schedule will be, but...

496
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,308
That's all right.

497
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,853
But I really do think you should
continue with the sign language.

498
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,273
And any additional therapies that
kids need for the cochlear implant.

499
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,858
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

500
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,694
- Good night.
- Good night.

501
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,121
Is anyone seeing this?

502
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:15,176
Hey.

503
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,643
It's all right.
Calm down, okay?

504
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,650
- Samantha?
- Are you out of your mind?

505
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,918
Not a word.

506
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,921
You didn't say one word
about this to me.

507
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:53,965
Don't you think
you owe me that?

508
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,759
Don't you think that you might
respect me enough...

509
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,095
... to at least consider
what I'd have to say?

510
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,183
I didn't want you
worrying about it.

511
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,979
Well, I'm worried, Curtis.
How are you paying for all that?

512
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,694
I got a home improvement
loan from the bank.

513
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:22,368
How could you do that
without talking to me?

514
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,622
You know the expenses
we have coming up.

515
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,126
You want to waste money
on a stupid tornado shelter?

516
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:33,462
I'm doing it... I'm doing it for us.

517
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,131
I know you don't understand.

518
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:37,675
You're right.
I don't understand.

519
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:43,889
I don't understand half the stuff
you've been doing lately.

520
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,476
I don't understand
you putting Red out back.

521
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,228
I don't understand...

522
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:54,358
... you staying up all night
in that stupid tornado shelter.

523
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,028
You don't come to bed
half the time.

524
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:01,282
You leave, you don't tell me where
you're going. Explain that to me.

525
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,242
Please.

526
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,455
Tell me something...

527
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,626
... that helps me understand
why you're being like this.

528
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:16,672
There's nothing to explain.

529
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:24,347
I'm gonna go
put Hannah to bed.

530
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,323
Curtis?

531
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,704
Baby.
Oh, my God. Baby...

532
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,834
Oh, my God.
Baby.

533
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,507
I need an ambulance!

534
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,843
My husband's having a seizure.

535
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:48,347
41800 Tindale Road.
Hurry up. He's bleeding!

536
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,769
Okay.

537
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,869
Honey?

538
01:03:08,778 --> 01:03:09,869
Honey?

539
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,211
Honey?
Are you okay?

540
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,598
You were having a seizure.
I called an ambulance.

541
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,396
No. It's fine. It's fine.
Don't send an ambulance.

542
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,732
- What are you doing?
- It's fine.

543
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,447
Ma'am?

544
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,365
Baby, what's going on?

545
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,797
I'm sorry you fellows had
to come all the way out.

546
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,382
It's what we do.

547
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,592
Now we can still take you in...

548
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,427
... if you want a doctor to look
at those cuts in your mouth.

549
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,430
Yeah, that's all right.
I'll see somebody on Monday.

550
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,806
All right.

551
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,767
Thanks.

552
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,650
I haven't been honest with you.

553
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,571
I'm sorry.

554
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:13,576
What's going on?

555
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,125
I've been having these dreams.

556
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,631
I guess they're more
like nightmares.

557
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,844
It's why I've been
acting like this.

558
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,514
They...

559
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,769
They always start
with a kind of storm.

560
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,692
Like a real powerful storm.

561
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,861
And there's always...

562
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,573
... this dark, thick rain.

563
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,242
Like fresh motor oil.

564
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:02,541
And then the things...

565
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,920
... people,
it just makes them crazy.

566
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,216
They attack me.
Sometimes...

567
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,889
Sometimes they go
after Hannah.

568
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,226
First one I had...

569
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,188
... Red nearly chewed
through my arm.

570
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,734
That's why you
put him out back?

571
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:30,819
Yeah.

572
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:42,447
What was the dream?
Tonight.

573
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,048
It was Dewart.

574
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,426
We were at the job site.

575
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:59,848
The storm started
and something happened.

576
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,392
His face...

577
01:07:04,104 --> 01:07:06,230
His eyes were...

578
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,317
... different.

579
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,487
He came after me
with a pickax.

580
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,115
And we fought.

581
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,202
And he ran it through my leg.

582
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,130
It's hard to explain...

583
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,593
... because it's not just a dream.

584
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,099
It's a feeling.

585
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:53,402
I'm afraid something
might be coming.

586
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,656
Something that's...

587
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,492
... not right.

588
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,166
I cannot describe it.

589
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,169
I just need you to believe me.

590
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,842
I've been to a counselor.

591
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,345
I've seen her...

592
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,515
... I've seen her a few times.

593
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,438
You know what I come from.

594
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,403
And I promised myself...

595
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,163
I promised myself
I would never leave.

596
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,734
And I am doing
everything that I can...

597
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,888
... to make that true.

598
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,542
Okay, since the doctor's
approved her surgery...

599
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,044
... we just need
to get her scheduled.

600
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:38,757
The next possible opening
is the 21st of next month.

601
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,175
That's six weeks.

602
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,386
- Six weeks?
- Is that okay?

603
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,929
It's wonderful.

604
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:56,024
... this point just to the west.
I don't think we'll have any problem.

605
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,735
We should be able to get 20,
maybe 30 in this next week.

606
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:02,114
But we're looking to see
how that's gonna shape up, so...

607
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,825
- Curtis?
- Yeah.

608
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:08,287
- What do you think?
- Yeah. That sounds good.

609
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,831
We'll get it done.

610
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,844
Come in.

611
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,890
What you need, Curtis?

612
01:10:31,603 --> 01:10:33,979
- I need a favor, Jim.
- What's that?

613
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,481
Can you take Dewart
off my crew?

614
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,984
Just reassign him
someplace else.

615
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,825
What's the trouble?
He not pulling his weight?

616
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,995
No, nothing like that.
He's a good worker.

617
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,205
He's a good man.
He's my friend.

618
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:58,670
I think it'd be easier not being in
charge of someone I'm so close to.

619
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,798
You know, I understand...

620
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,929
... this is part of what it means
to manage people, Curtis.

621
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,430
You're gonna
have to learn that.

622
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:11,767
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that, but...

623
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:16,146
Well, it would just be
very helpful in this case.

624
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:18,357
Okay.

625
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,902
Well, I can put him
with Russell.

626
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:25,697
- Anybody else you'd prefer?
- No. Whoever you think's right.

627
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,992
Okay.
Okay.

628
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,370
Thank you.

629
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,332
You been missing
a lot of work, Curtis.

630
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:39,127
I know. My daughter's
had a lot of doctor's visits.

631
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,379
I haven't let anything
get behind.

632
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,547
No, but don't.
Okay?

633
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,549
Yes, sir.

634
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:01,108
I know they just usually
do oysters and fries...

635
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:04,111
... but what if we did something
healthier on the side?

636
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:06,905
What, like 'slaw?

637
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:10,242
I don't know.
Maybe a vegetable or salad.

638
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,629
Dewart's been telling me how
strange Curtis has been acting lately.

639
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,799
I'm so sorry.

640
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:31,179
It's not like you don't have enough
on your plate with Hannah.

641
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,681
Things are fine.

642
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,021
We're fine.

643
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,952
Can I help you?

644
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:55,954
Yeah.

645
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,293
Can I look at one
of these gas masks?

646
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:01,293
Sure.

647
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:02,794
Which one you wanna look at?

648
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,629
The newest one.

649
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,971
- How much?
- $178.

650
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,307
Anything cheaper?

651
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,685
No. That's the cheapest one
I got in the store.

652
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,521
They go all the way up to $290.

653
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,317
I don't know
what you want to spend...

654
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,778
... but a gas mask ain't something
you want to go cheap on.

655
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,989
You got any kids' sizes?

656
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,491
No.

657
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,701
Kids can't wear those.

658
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:37,496
They gotta have a special thing,
it's like a hood.

659
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,415
I don't fool with those.

660
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,524
What the hell are you doing?

661
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:19,496
What you got going on here?

662
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:25,877
I'm just adding
on to the storm shelter.

663
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,339
- Why?
- Just because.

664
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,677
You running water to it?

665
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,887
Yeah.
From our well.

666
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,974
Running sewer
out to the city line.

667
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,561
How much you spending
on this thing?

668
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,896
- It's not bad.
- Doesn't look it.

669
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,819
You take your eye off the ball
one minute in this economy...

670
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:52,571
... and you're screwed.

671
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,740
- You got the cash for this?
- Yeah.

672
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,328
Don't put nothing on credit cards.
That shit will eat you up.

673
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:01,580
I'm not.

674
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:11,965
Samantha called me.

675
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:14,676
I figured.

676
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,181
Called you to come
tell me to quit?

677
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,266
She called 'cause she's worried.

678
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,518
Says you've been stressed out.

679
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,440
- So?
- So what?

680
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:30,859
You stressed out?

681
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,322
No.
No more than anybody else.

682
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,533
Work all right?

683
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,741
Hey, look. You wanna come by
and have dinner sometime, Kyle...

684
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:46,625
... that's fine.

685
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,501
We'll have a beer and
talk about the old days...

686
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,586
... but you got something
to say, just say it.

687
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,296
You can stop
that shit right now.

688
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,025
I'll come over there and
remind you what it's like...

689
01:15:53,026 --> 01:15:55,000
... to get your ass whipped.

690
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,639
I'm just coming here
to check on you.

691
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,807
Well, I appreciate it, Kyle.

692
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,151
You been to see Mom?

693
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,528
Yeah.
A few days ago.

694
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:19,908
She all right?

695
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:23,286
You should see her.

696
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,580
Take your girls.

697
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,833
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll get around to it.

698
01:16:37,969 --> 01:16:40,387
- You need a hand?
- No, I got it.

699
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,182
Okay.

700
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:49,229
- Call me if you need me, okay?
- I will.

701
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,566
Hey, Kyle?

702
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,029
Actually, you could
do me a favor.

703
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,074
- What's that?
- You still looking for a dog?

704
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,285
Sure.

705
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:06,705
They got a good spot
for you, okay, buddy?

706
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,043
- You sure?
- Yeah.

707
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,173
I know it'll make
my girls happy.

708
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,259
All right.

709
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,097
- Hey, Kyle?
- Yeah?

710
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,230
Okay.

711
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:34,899
Take care of yourself.

712
01:17:35,443 --> 01:17:38,069
All right, all right.
I will, little brother.

713
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:42,907
You take care of your family.
Handle your business, okay?

714
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,768
All right.
Bedtime.

715
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,941
You okay?

716
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,424
Who's that?

717
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,180
Oh, shit.

718
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,104
Hey, Jim.

719
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,733
Curtis.

720
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:11,226
Dewart told me you took
equipment from work...

721
01:21:11,227 --> 01:21:13,326
... for a project at your house.

722
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:16,579
Said that's why you
wanted him off your crew.

723
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:20,458
I came out here
to see it myself.

724
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:25,004
Yeah. It was just
a hauler and a backhoe.

725
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,593
It was Saturday. I had them
back in less than eight hours.

726
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,679
You know that doesn't matter.

727
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:39,352
I can't even tell you
how many rules you broke.

728
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:42,063
What if you had an accident?
Huh?

729
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:45,817
What if you ran somebody
over on your way out here?

730
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:49,988
Lawsuit like that
could bankrupt me.

731
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,155
Well...

732
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,701
... I'm sorry, Jim.
I hadn't thought of that.

733
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,579
Thank God nothing like
that happened, you know?

734
01:21:58,747 --> 01:22:01,332
I'll do whatever
I can to make it right.

735
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,460
You can pick up
your last check on Friday.

736
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:07,505
You got two weeks' benefits.

737
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,641
Did you fire Dewart, too?

738
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,477
He's on two weeks' leave, unpaid.

739
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,485
I'm sorry, Curtis.

740
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,866
You did this to yourself.

741
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:44,375
Damn.

742
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:01,434
I've been fired.

743
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,399
What about
the health insurance?

744
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,404
We get two more weeks.

745
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,915
I'm sorry.

746
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:50,608
- Excuse me.
- Are you Curtis?

747
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,652
- Yeah.
- Come in.

748
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:56,489
Kendra transferred out.
I'll be meeting with you today.

749
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,658
Please, sit down.

750
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,714
What happened to Kendra?

751
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:18,636
She got into a program at OSU,
so she'll be transferring near there.

752
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,974
I've split her caseload
with another counselor.

753
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,561
It's been kind of crazy
around here lately.

754
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,689
So...

755
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,651
I've looked over your file.

756
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:38,197
It says your mother was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia...

757
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:39,991
... in her early 30s.

758
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:45,288
Let's start there.

759
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,804
I'm so sorry.
I completely forgot.

760
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,931
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

761
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,434
- Thanks.
- Here. I hope you like them.

762
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:51,604
- I brought cash.
- That's terrific. It's fine.

763
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,773
Call me if they don't work
and I'm sorry again.

764
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,858
It's okay.
Thank you.

765
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:51,455
Okay.
All done. Done.

766
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,464
Sweet dreams.

767
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:25,406
What's that?

768
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,620
That's the alternator
from the truck.

769
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:36,709
I was just trying to figure out a way
to charge enough batteries...

770
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,669
... to run lights down there.

771
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:44,550
Yeah, what the hell. Maybe I'll
hook it up to your old Exercycle.

772
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:53,142
You gonna leave me?

773
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:58,773
You flinched when I touched
your hand this morning.

774
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,067
I'm sorry.

775
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,321
I was in one of your dreams?

776
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,156
Yeah.

777
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:12,119
Can you deal with that?

778
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,181
Yeah.

779
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,565
Okay.
Then I made a decision.

780
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,651
We cancel the beach trip...

781
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,000
... we have enough to cover bills
for the next two months...

782
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:47,780
... with your last check.

783
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:51,158
I'm gonna get a job.
You're gonna find another job.

784
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:53,744
I'm gonna call to see if we can
move Hannah's surgery up.

785
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,598
We'll need to see what it costs
to extend your policy...

786
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,498
... to the end of the year.

787
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,918
I want you to see a psychiatrist.

788
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,256
Not a counselor from the free clinic.
Someone good.

789
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:10,970
Dr. Shannan gave me
the number of somebody...

790
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:14,682
... but I just don't think
we can afford it.

791
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:17,977
We'll find the money.

792
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,482
Also, the Lions Club
supper's this weekend.

793
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:22,982
I want you to come with me.

794
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,859
I don't want to see
any of those people.

795
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,569
I want you to go.

796
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,614
I need to do
something normal.

797
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:42,251
All right.

798
01:30:18,288 --> 01:30:20,165
How many pieces
does Hannah get?

799
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,165
Just one.

800
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,431
What are you doing here?

801
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,728
Not here, man.

802
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,482
I said,
what are you doing here?

803
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,070
Curtis?

804
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:35,197
I told people
what you've been doing.

805
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,199
I know.

806
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,743
You cut me loose.

807
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,287
Everything we been through.

808
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,580
I know.
I'm sorry.

809
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:45,207
- Hey, hey.
- You ain't fucking sorry.

810
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:46,917
- All right.
- You ain't fucking sorry.

811
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,253
If you're sorry,
you wouldn't cut me loose.

812
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:50,963
We're fucking friends!
This how you treat friends?

813
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,089
Come on.

814
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:54,091
God damn it.

815
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,052
Stop it, Dewart!

816
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,221
Fuck!

817
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:01,974
I said not here!

818
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:05,394
God damn it!

819
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,858
You think I'm crazy?

820
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:13,152
Is that what he told you?

821
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,781
Well, listen up!

822
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,787
There is a storm coming...

823
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,126
... like nothing
you have ever seen!

824
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,381
And not a one of you
is prepared for it!

825
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,391
You think I'm crazy?

826
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,311
Hey, I'm talking to you, Russell!

827
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,606
Lewis!
You think I'm a thief?

828
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,413
Sleep well in your beds.

829
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:08,916
Because if this thing
comes true...

830
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:13,170
... there ain't gonna
be any more.

831
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:47,264
Hannah?

832
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:51,727
Hannah!

833
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,251
Curtis?
Wake up! Wake up!

834
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,311
Come on.
It's okay.

835
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:07,446
It's okay.

836
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,740
See?

837
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,743
All right.
Come on. Sit down.

838
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:14,703
All right.

839
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:22,461
Okay, honey, here you go.

840
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:25,088
- No. Don't do that.
- It's okay. It's oxygen.

841
01:37:25,173 --> 01:37:26,882
Here.
Put this on.

842
01:37:28,259 --> 01:37:30,469
- Are you kidding?
- Please, just do it.

843
01:37:30,929 --> 01:37:32,179
Okay?

844
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:34,389
There we go.

845
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:37,392
All right.

846
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,270
Keep it out of your eyes.
Okay?

847
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,274
Hey, I love you.
It's okay.

848
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,611
All right?
All right. Okay.

849
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,004
Wake up, babe.

850
01:40:20,139 --> 01:40:21,264
Where is your mask?

851
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:23,308
We took them off.
It's fine.

852
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:26,645
- No.
- Take it off.

853
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:28,814
No.

854
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,273
We're fine.

855
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,402
Take it off.

856
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,516
You need to open
the door now.

857
01:41:10,356 --> 01:41:11,898
What if it's...

858
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,316
... what if it's not over?

859
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:16,486
What?

860
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,409
What if it's not over?

861
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,414
It's over.

862
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,208
Get the keys.

863
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:33,003
Open the door.

864
01:43:28,369 --> 01:43:30,120
It's still storming.

865
01:43:31,706 --> 01:43:33,081
No, it's not.

866
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:37,627
I can hear it.

867
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,548
I don't hear anything.

868
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:51,933
Put your hand on the door.
You can feel it.

869
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:35,602
Thunder?
Do you feel it?

870
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:44,027
You feel it?

871
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:10,971
I'm sorry.

872
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:18,561
Baby, there's no storm outside.

873
01:45:26,904 --> 01:45:28,321
I'm sorry.

874
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:33,243
Curtis, I wouldn't lie to you.

875
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:38,406
We love you very much.

876
01:45:43,004 --> 01:45:44,587
Please...

877
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:49,426
... open the door.

878
01:45:52,930 --> 01:45:54,222
I'm sorry.

879
01:45:58,144 --> 01:45:59,436
I can't.

880
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:23,209
I love you, but if I open the door,
then nothing's gonna change.

881
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:26,755
You'll see that
everything's fine...

882
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,299
... but nothing will change.

883
01:46:31,177 --> 01:46:32,427
Please.

884
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:37,515
This is what it means
to stay with us.

885
01:46:45,608 --> 01:46:48,068
This is something
you have to do.

886
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:58,888
Could you move
Hannah back?

887
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:17,193
It's fine.

888
01:51:00,321 --> 01:51:03,573
Do you have any vacation time
that you can use?

889
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:08,703
I don't have a job right now.

890
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:13,249
Well, I know
that times are hard...

891
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,961
... but I think it's really important
for you to separate yourself...

892
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,629
... from that storm shelter.

893
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,758
I think you need to break away
from it for a while.

894
01:51:21,842 --> 01:51:24,052
We can start you on some
medication that I think will help...

895
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:26,804
... but that action alone
would mean a lot.

896
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:30,266
We usually go on a trip
to Myrtle Beach each summer.

897
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,561
We were gonna go this month.

898
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:36,773
I think that would be okay...

899
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:39,942
... if we start
the medication now.

900
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:43,321
And it would give you all some
time to prepare as a family.

901
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:45,490
But I want to be clear...

902
01:51:45,574 --> 01:51:48,284
... when Curtis gets back, he'll
need to take more time than that.

903
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:50,953
What does that mean?

904
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:56,167
I mean that he'll need
hands-on therapy at a real facility.

905
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,841
You mean I have
to leave my family?

906
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:11,808
I think you need to seriously
commit to some treatment.

907
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:45,174
Hey...

908
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:48,594
Good, huh?

909
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:16,080
Okay.

910
01:53:23,755 --> 01:53:24,964
There we go.

911
01:53:26,133 --> 01:53:27,300
Let's make a river.

912
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,434
Good.
Yeah.

913
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:41,105
We put a top on it.

914
01:53:47,988 --> 01:53:49,030
What is it, honey?

915
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:56,078
What?

916
01:55:41,893 --> 01:55:42,935
Sam.

917
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:48,691
Okay.
