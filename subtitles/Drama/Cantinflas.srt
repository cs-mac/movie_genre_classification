1
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:14,234
As the year comes to an end,
millions await the highly publicized epic battle...

2
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,070
between the major
Hollywood studios next fall.

3
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,409
It seems they all agree
that the bigger the movie, the better.

4
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,678
The Ten Commandments,
Paramount's bet, has started production...

5
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,980
and is a strong candidate for the Oscars.

6
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,956
With Charlton Heston as Moses,
they clearly have an edge.

7
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,822
It would take a Giant to defeat them-

8
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,227
and that's exactly
what Warner Brothers is making...

9
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:42,028
with Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean
in a torrid romance-

10
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,625
unless The King and I...

11
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,398
a 20th Century Fox musical
starring Yul Brynner...

12
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,133
takes them by surprise.

13
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:54,805
On a sad note, after winning
its first Best Picture award...

14
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,213
United Artists has lost one of
its founding partners, Mary Pickford...

15
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,481
leaving Chaplin and Fairbanks
with a heavy task.

16
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,218
How are they going to enter
this epic race...

17
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,019
when their most ambitious project...

18
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,788
Jules Verne 's
Around the World in Eighty Days...

19
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,363
has not even started production?

20
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,629
Word has it that glamorous,
first-time producer Mike Todd...

21
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,566
could become the last of his kind...

22
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,731
as independent productions
are being pushed aside by the system.

23
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,189
Thank you. Hello.

24
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,231
- Thank you so much.
- Have a great day.

25
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,527
You too. Bye.

26
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,229
Hey, Mike. How do you like Hollywood?

27
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,532
Well, it's a bit warmer than New York...

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,165
but the real question is
if Hollywood likes me.

29
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,073
They say you're here
to meet Elizabeth Taylor.

30
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,169
In her case, I'm quite sure she will.

31
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,286
Sorry I'm late.

32
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm still getting used
to the size of this city.

33
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,261
Yes, well, let's get started, shall we?

34
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,856
We're on a tight schedule here.

35
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,027
Miss Taylor. It's an honor.

36
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,729
Mr. Todd.

37
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,636
That was my father's name.
Please call me Mike.

38
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,005
Mike.

39
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,079
We have several appointments this morning.

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,172
And yours-well, it's now half over.

41
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,410
Robert, all I'm here
to talk about today...

42
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,612
is the biggest event
in the history of cinema...

43
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,155
since the first
movie projection by Lumière.

44
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:49,058
This is gonna be the biggest,
the most entertaining...

45
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,790
spectacular and thrilling movie
the world has ever seen.

46
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,163
Yes, thank you, Mr. Todd.
We also read Variety.

47
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,202
We know all about your idea.

48
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,532
I mean, who doesn't?

49
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,164
Now let's hear your proposal.

50
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,743
That is my proposal, Robert.

51
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,438
You see, I want to capture
all the beauty there is in the world...

52
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,244
and there is no way I could possibly
dream of doing that...

53
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,218
unless Miss Taylor is a part of this.

54
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,549
I don't know how things are done
on the East Coast...

55
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,682
but here we'd rather cut to the chase.

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,323
Here's the bottom line, Mr. Todd.

57
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,952
Miss Taylor-

58
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,829
Miss Elizabeth Taylor-
has an exclusive contract.

59
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,664
I'm not interested
in breaking any contracts.

60
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,795
That's why she'd be doing
a special appearance.

61
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,303
Frank Sinatra's doing the same thing.

62
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,037
Let me see if I get this.
Your proposal is essentially...

63
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:44,606
to have Hollywood's biggest star
in your movie for free.

64
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,548
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

65
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,813
No wonder your picture's being shut down.

66
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,890
Robert. You don't have to be mean.

67
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,788
I'm sorry, Liz. I'm really sorry.

68
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,191
But I mean-This is so atypical.

69
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,457
Well, now, I never said
I wanted Miss Taylor for nothing.

70
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,556
Ah. Okay.

71
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,593
So let's hear your final proposal then.

72
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,902
How would you feel about
pulling up to the world premiere...

73
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,277
of Around the World in Eighty Days
in your own brand-new limousine?

74
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:21,683
We'll even make the interior violet
to match those lovely eyes.

75
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,327
What happened?

76
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,091
- She fell for it.
- Wow. Really?

77
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,492
- She's in the movie.
- Well, maybe not.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
But at the premiere, for sure.

79
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,433
- I don't get-
- You will.

80
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,768
- And you'll need to get us another car.
- What?

81
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,467
I'll explain later. Right now,
we need to get ready for John, all right?

82
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,703
He's got the jitters again.
This time, it could be serious.

83
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,110
Now, any news from Sinatra?

84
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,012
- No, but I got this picture of Mario Moreno.
- Who?

85
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,381
- Mexican star. For the cameo role.
- Right, right, right.

86
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,647
Yeah, get him on
the next flying donkey to LA.

87
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,996
HELP WANTED

88
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,772
Dearest ladies and gentlemen
of the audience...

89
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,502
thank you, thank you.

90
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,875
It is my great pleasure to introduce...

91
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,314
The Jiménez Sisters!

92
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,621
I can see fat girls at home!

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,662
Let's see some legs.

94
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,568
Come on.
Have a little respect for the ladies.

95
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,001
Did you say little? Get out of here.

96
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,634
Are you talking to me?

97
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,710
Calm down. Order, order.

98
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,460
Please. That's enough. Calm down, please.

99
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,031
Sir, I'm here about the job.

100
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,148
- What's your name?
- Mario. Mario Moreno.

101
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,981
Where do you live?

102
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,227
What brings you out here?

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,922
There was supposed to be a boxing match...

104
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,729
but the fight was canceled.

105
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,324
- Are you any good?
- I get by.

106
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,398
All right. You're hired as an assistant.

107
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,032
Thank you, sir.

108
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,201
The job is to clean everything
after each performance.

109
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,474
Especially the dressing rooms.
They're a mess. You know actors.

110
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,208
You'll also help with the tickets.

111
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,683
And every now and then
if a drunk gets in, throw him out.

112
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,787
Sorry. I didn't know you were busy.

113
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,402
That's Estela.

114
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,238
My daughter.

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,605
Help me keep an eye on her, too.

116
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,145
Of course, Don José.
An eye, an ear, from head to tail.

117
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,373
I'll give it all I've got.

118
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,553
Welcome to Pagola's Tent Show.

119
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,056
Thank you, sir.

120
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,591
Let's see.

121
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,628
Let me see some of that fancy footwork.

122
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,560
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,281
One more. Going low. That's it.

124
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,881
Excuse me.

125
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,314
Excuse me.

126
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,693
What do you want?

127
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,695
I'm "El Chato" Moreno.

128
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,628
We had a fight scheduled
for last Saturday.

129
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,498
We did. We postponed it
to protect my boy's career.

130
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,695
And my career?

131
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,935
What career, Chato?
You haven't won a single fight.

132
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,840
Maybe because you haven't
put your boy in front of me.

133
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,171
Really? Think you're hot stuff?

134
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,250
I'm hot-blooded, man.

135
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:24,789
Okay. Let's put 30 pesos on it
to make it interesting. Loser pays.

136
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,950
- You're on.
- You're on.

137
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,054
Go on. Time's a-wasting.

138
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,163
Get closer.

139
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,269
Hit him.

140
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,452
Hit him. Don't just dodge. Hit him.

141
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,747
Hit him.

142
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,022
Stand up.

143
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,573
That's good.

144
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,315
Later you can do the others.

145
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,043
You got it, Don José.

146
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,480
Don't worry about the money.
A bet is a bet.

147
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,057
No, I really wanted to win.

148
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,522
I ended up making a fool of myself.

149
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,857
Maybe boxing isn't your thing.

150
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,158
You looked more like a bullfighter.

151
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,747
Enough already. Get out of here.

152
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,319
Deadbeats.

153
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,390
Who does this guy think he is?

154
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,725
Sorry?

155
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,631
- Who's the show-off?
- He's the breeder's nephew.

156
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,102
Since they provide the young bulls,
he's up first.

157
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,368
When it's worn out, it's our turn,
but what's the point?

158
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,978
¡Olé!

159
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,112
That's not a bull, man.
Looks more like a dog.

160
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,952
- Here, little doggy.
- They should feed him.

161
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,525
Why don't you feed him?

162
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,528
Closer, blondie. Don't be scared.

163
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,463
- He won't bite.
- You got that right.

164
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,065
Hey, you.

165
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,234
Yes, sir?

166
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,970
Think you can do better?

167
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,568
We'll see who wears the pants.

168
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,513
These may be patchy,
but I'll give him a kick in the pants.

169
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,050
- Come on. Let's see.
- You're on.

170
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,220
Come on, charge.

171
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,794
Don't be shy.

172
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,560
See? It's not so easy, kid.

173
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,873
Let 'er rip.

174
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:06,577
Is this a bullfight or what?
You're ruining the animal.

175
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,615
Come on, little bull.

176
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,351
¡Olé! ¡Olé!

177
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,699
¡Olé!

178
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,397
- He's much better than the nephew.
- Yeah, look.

179
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,306
This is no bullfighter. The guy's a clown.

180
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:41,635
Come on, little bull.

181
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,084
Mama!

182
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,989
Hey, how are you? Are you okay?

183
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,889
Huh? What happened?

184
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,621
Take it easy. You're bruised all over.

185
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,796
How'd I do?

186
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,366
It looked like you were dancing.

187
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,695
You're really funny.

188
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,997
What are you laughing at?

189
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,099
Haven't you ever seen black-face?

190
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,181
Yeah, in the movies.

191
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,745
So...

192
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,676
aren't you nervous?

193
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,981
It beats going hungry.

194
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,559
Why do you put up with all this?

195
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,252
You think I was born to push a broom?

196
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,089
No.

197
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,269
- Promise me something.
- Whatever you want, babe.

198
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,536
If you ever make it big, take me with you.

199
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,444
Or just take me now, already.

200
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,512
Hurry up. You're on next.

201
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,877
- This is going to be a disaster.
- He's really funny.

202
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,749
Get him out of here!

203
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,415
- That's enough.
- Just a little longer. You'll see.

204
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,667
Bring back the fatties!

205
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,580
That's the last time I listen to you.

206
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,180
Why'd you stop me?
I was just getting going.

207
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,314
Just getting going? You hear that?

208
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,892
Go get them under control.

209
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,458
No, Don José.
He started this, let him stop it!

210
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,468
Get cleaned up first.
We don't want them to recognize you.

211
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,575
Here.

212
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,566
Come on.

213
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,645
Come on.

214
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,844
Get rid of that clown!

215
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,042
Ladies...

216
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,650
Ladies and gentlemen-

217
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,483
Please...

218
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,819
Good evening, lovely gentlemen,
and esteemed ladies.

219
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,160
Kindly lend me your attention.

220
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,530
Now what?

221
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,659
That's it!

222
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,329
At least you could throw me
the other sandal.

223
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,008
Yikes! Better not. I smell a rat.

224
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,178
Here's the rub.
Now you have to go home barefoot.

225
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,045
No, no. Don't be a jerk.

226
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,251
But it gets under my skin, man.
You should be more friendly.

227
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,721
Aren't I giving you-And when did I ever-

228
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,622
It just gets under my skin, man.

229
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,794
Now listen up...

230
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,887
so they can't tell me I didn't tell you
what they told me to tell you.

231
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,262
- What?
- What's wrong, miss?

232
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,096
Weren't you listening?

233
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,195
Or were you paying attention
to that dreamboat at your side?

234
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,775
Who, by the way,
couldn't take his eyes off of me.

235
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,310
Maybe that's why he wasn't eyeing you.

236
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,308
So put your hands together...

237
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,612
and welcome these lovely girls
to the stage!

238
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,291
- Don't ever do that again.
- Did you see that?

239
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,453
What?

240
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,157
That I got all mixed up?
That I hardly knew what I was saying?

241
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,791
No. They loved your style.

242
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,931
My style?

243
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,336
Gosh. I'll have to rehearse it then.

244
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,035
No. Please, just be yourself.

245
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,072
Then I'd better get to work
on the dressing rooms.

246
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,411
The trash is really piling up today.

247
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,984
Cheer up, champ.

248
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,225
Mama!

249
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,091
Estelita, girl.

250
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,527
What?

251
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,532
No. What are you doing?
Your father's going to catch us!

252
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,236
- Estelita.
- Mario, take me with you.

253
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,496
Where?

254
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,504
Get off of me!

255
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,241
Get off of me.

256
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,583
Get lost!

257
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,211
I won't kick your ass
because I caught you just in time.

258
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,982
I just kept an eye on her.

259
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,556
She threw her whole body at me.

260
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:56,025
Get out! And don't come back!

261
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,876
I really liked your act.

262
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,239
My act?

263
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,350
My father-in-law owns a tent show
in Mexico City.

264
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,922
I'd like you to audition.

265
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,217
Mexico City?

266
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,318
I am Estanislao Shilinsky.

267
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,328
Look me up, if you're interested.

268
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,333
Mr. Todd, Sinatra
is performing in Vegas...

269
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,337
David Niven is not answering the phone...

270
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,237
and Marlene Dietrich says
she doesn't work for free.

271
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,832
What should we do about Liz Taylor?

272
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,412
Stop working. Kid, you're gonna be fine.

273
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,956
Okay. Thank you, George.
We'll see you around 3:00.

274
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,622
- Billy, make sure you send those flowers.
- Yes, sir.

275
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,978
Mike. Thanks for coming.
I hear you've been pretty busy.

276
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,278
I should have known no one can take
so much as a sip of water in this town...

277
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,284
without your knowledge, John.

278
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,217
I see you brought our good friend Maurice.

279
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,688
Yes, Maurice will be joining us.

280
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,157
I like to get his opinion,
if you don't mind.

281
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,750
Mind? Of course not.

282
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:14,230
More than happy to have
such a, uh, fine gentleman like Maurice with us.

283
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,927
All right. Well,
let's get started then, shall we?

284
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,294
All right.

285
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,738
What can I do for you, John?

286
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,106
We have some concerns
about Around the World in Eighty Days.

287
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,305
Concerns? What concerns?
It's a great story-

288
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,412
You are corrupting Jules Verne's story.

289
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,456
You know, we have spent a fortune...

290
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,084
and we haven't had any results.

291
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,562
You have my word, John.
You are gonna be amazed.

292
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,963
Come on. Get serious, Mike.

293
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,868
This idea of yours about having
50 international stars from all over the world...

294
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,371
for free...

295
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,669
is, quite frankly, ridiculous.

296
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,576
John, everybody, and I mean everybody,
wants to be part of this thing.

297
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,671
I just got off the phone with Thailand.

298
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,013
The king himself
wants to lend us his own barge.

299
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,680
Have you not heard
of, um, miniatures models?

300
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,122
I've heard of miniature minds.
Small thinkers. Lack of vision.

301
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,788
I'm making the most spectacular movie
in the history of cinema. For God's sake, John!

302
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,161
This is not one of your Broadway shows.

303
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,962
This is a major motion picture studio.

304
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,128
- There is a system, a protocol-
- Oh!

305
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,105
Mike. Mike.
Maurice is only trying to help.

306
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,675
We're under a lot of pressure here...

307
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:36,840
and you seem to be distracted with this
pie in the sky idea of international casting.

308
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,644
I am not distracted at all.

309
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,980
Mike, we have a press conference
coming up in one week...

310
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,117
and we have yet to see the contracts
for any of the cast.

311
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,491
And we will get there, John. I'm working-

312
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,464
For instance, I did get you that, uh,
Mexican actor you asked for.

313
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,263
- What, uh-
- Moreno? This Mario Moreno?

314
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,861
Sure. I just sent him his plane tickets.
He's on his way.

315
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:04,373
- Doesn't he own three planes?
- They're being repaired.

316
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,136
Okay. Well, let's get
all the paperwork prepared...

317
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,612
and set up a luncheon with him...

318
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,207
just before the press conference
so we can talk strategy.

319
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,618
- Good. Good.
- Make sure there's a reporter...

320
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:22,853
from every international publication
on the planet at that conference.

321
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,895
Come on, Maurice.
We got a lot of work to do.

322
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,688
Mike.

323
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,665
- All right, John. Good.
- All right.

324
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,834
Mexico City.

325
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,656
Estanislao Shilinsky.

326
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,690
Shilinsky.

327
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,119
That's my pal!

328
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,220
Esteemed audience...

329
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,764
ladies and gentlemen...

330
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,892
Valentina's Tent Show
is proud to present...

331
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,402
all the way from Russia...

332
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,371
with all of their beauty and talent...

333
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,442
the incomparable...

334
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,307
Ivanova Zubareff Sisters!

335
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:35,327
Come on there, buddy.
Cat got your tongue?

336
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,453
Come on there, buddy.
Cat got your tongue?

337
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,028
Six days before the press conference.

338
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:42,088
Mr. Todd, the next plane to Mexico City
leaves tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

339
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,535
I don't understand.

340
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,797
The Mexican guy's supposed
to be flying here for the press conference.

341
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,372
You heard John.

342
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,737
I'm afraid it's a bit
more complicated than that, sir.

343
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:55,506
Mr. Moreno is expecting you
at a bullfight.

344
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,147
So I have to go to Mexico
to close this guy.

345
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,450
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, bullfight-

346
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,719
Very Hemingway. At least I'm a fan.

347
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,385
Mr. Moreno is not a fan.

348
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:13,293
He's the one actually fighting the bull.

349
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,792
What?

350
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,703
My God.

351
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,136
Hey, gorgeous.

352
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,009
- Who are you calling gorgeous?
- Your bird.

353
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,480
How dare you! I'll bash your face in!

354
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,141
- It'll cost you.
- What do you mean?

355
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,242
Please, sir. Don't get worked up.

356
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,980
Don't worry, darling. Right this way.

357
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,215
- You don't know who you're talking to!
- Who are you?

358
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,020
Young man, I am noble.
Blue blood runs in my veins.

359
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,891
- You're a fountain pen?
- This is an outrage. I demand a duel.

360
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,486
I only drooled as a baby.

361
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,828
- Tomorrow in the woods!
- What are we...

362
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,162
Tomorrow in the woods!

363
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,966
- What are we...
- No, no, no, Mario!

364
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,007
That's the fifth time,
and you can't get it.

365
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,669
"What are we...

366
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,745
nymphs??"

367
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,143
It's not hard.
You just have to say the words.

368
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,547
But they aren't my words.
They weren't written for me.

369
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,616
Don Mario is putting on airs.

370
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,347
Would you rather I wrote you a poem?

371
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,626
What if we just take the idea and run with it?

372
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,330
Nyet. No, no.

373
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:20,728
That's it. I told you.

374
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,767
You memorize lines. I don't.
I improvise. You don't.

375
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,701
So as they say, what now?

376
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,269
Lapochka.

377
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,874
Lapochka.

378
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,921
Okay. You're on.

379
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,981
If it doesn't work,
we can forget about pairing up.

380
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,616
Okay. Cue me.

381
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,588
I am noble. Blue blood runs in my veins.

382
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:57,327
- You're a fountain pen?
- This is an outrage! I demand a duel!

383
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,403
- I only drooled as a baby.
- Tomorrow in the woods!

384
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,802
- What are we, nymphs?
- I'll bring my seconds.

385
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,704
It won't work out.
It will take at least a few minutes.

386
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,705
Well? Like it?

387
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,842
I think it might work.

388
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,420
It's a matter of timing.

389
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,319
We go back and forth
and let the dialogue flow.

390
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,359
But don't forget-
leave the punch lines to me.

391
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,587
Just don't knock me out with boredom.

392
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,657
- You were good.
- I can't work like this.

393
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,996
You were good. I'm proud of you.

394
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,625
I'm proud of myself too.

395
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,081
Good evening, my dear gentlemen...

396
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,212
and your dear ladies.

397
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,051
Because last time I said my dear ladies...

398
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,625
they sent me packing.

399
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,318
You were out of line, young man.

400
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,958
You are present here for something unique.
Because you are present.

401
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:06,469
If you weren't present,
you couldn't witness this wonderful thing.

402
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,795
I was facing the abyss...

403
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,500
when I said to myself...

404
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,338
"Self, you gotta take
a step forward, man."

405
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,138
So here I stand before you...

406
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,580
ready for the first duty
of every human being: To be happy.

407
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:23,085
And the second: To help others
pass a few happy moments.

408
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,857
Like that somewhat chubby
and contented guy who said-

409
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,118
What did he say?

410
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,059
Gosh. I don't remember.

411
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,324
Oh, yes. That moments pass...

412
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,899
and minutes too.

413
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,433
Even seconds do.

414
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,164
So from second to second,
you get your second wind, right?

415
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,705
I love.

416
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,331
You love. He loves.

417
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,501
We love. You love.

418
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,805
And they love.

419
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,773
I wish this was not just conjugation
but reality.

420
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,714
Since I'm starting to get
a little serious now...

421
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,615
here comes the moral of the story, kids.

422
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,984
If you've found yourself a gal...

423
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,716
take good care of her.

424
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:03,988
Because there are moments in life
that are truly "momentaneous."

425
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,939
I'm very proud of you. Love, V.

426
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,471
We're among the crème de la crème.

427
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,243
Someday they'll come to see us.

428
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,876
- At the tent show?
- No. In a real theater.

429
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,956
The boy can barely crawl,
and already he wants to run.

430
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,923
This is not for the likes of us, Mario.

431
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,085
And why not?

432
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:41,291
Because the upper crust
comes here for a thrill...

433
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,425
and to take a peek at
the dark underbelly of this town.

434
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,002
What's that about a belly?

435
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,629
Sorry. I'm trying out some new words.

436
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,899
There are two kinds of news.

437
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,404
The kind the government tells us...

438
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,773
and the truth.

439
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,605
May I?

440
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,008
This is the official news.

441
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,952
But inside this building,
there's another truth.

442
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,617
Thanks, just taking a look.
If I don't open it, I don't have to pay.

443
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,586
What's with that rude kid?

444
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,162
So, Plutarco, have you decided?

445
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:19,327
What's to decide?
You know how I like elections.

446
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,463
Right. You're a true democrat.

447
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,064
Shall we honor the decision of the people?

448
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,268
Of course.

449
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,210
The voice of the people
is the voice of God.

450
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,179
How's that?

451
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,149
Everyone will vote for the one I select.

452
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,780
But we won with 100% of the vote.

453
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,291
Not even the mother of the other candidate
voted for him?

454
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:45,191
Such are my powers of persuasion.

455
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,200
Look, Mario.

456
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,791
You see that guy up there?

457
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,062
He's a government minister.

458
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,597
They never acknowledge their mistakes...

459
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,835
but when they see them on stage...

460
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,433
they even laugh at them.

461
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,484
They dress better,
but they're not that different.

462
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,651
Come on.

463
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,729
No, let's go.

464
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,161
Good evening.

465
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,668
You're amazing.

466
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,442
I could dance with you
for the rest of my life.

467
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,246
I bet you say that to all the girls.

468
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,321
No way. You're the first.

469
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,152
Liar.

470
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,063
I'd like you to be the last.

471
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,024
Come on, Valita.

472
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,102
I'm coming.

473
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,637
Let's go. Come on.

474
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,536
Hurry, come on.

475
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,836
- Relax.
- What?

476
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,740
Come on, come on.

477
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,150
Now who do we have here?

478
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,344
- Just me, myself and I!
- What's happening?

479
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,015
How are you, pal?
What's in the box? A new suit?

480
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,591
The old one's stiff as a board.

481
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,718
Maybe, but at least it isn't patched together
like some I know.

482
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,660
Don't get your feathers in a ruffle.

483
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,527
I'm cool as a cucumber.

484
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:04,100
You think you're a fine kettle.

485
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,535
But you're just a clay pot from Tlaquepaque.
You crack at the first tap.

486
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:11,369
Sometimes I bend, because if I break,
this egg can't be put together again.

487
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,944
You're sharp as a tack.

488
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,307
Come on, Valita.

489
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,613
Was that Spanish?
I didn't understand a thing.

490
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,980
No, Valita. Pure Mexican.

491
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,552
Let's go.

492
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,249
So what's in the box?

493
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,991
It's a present for you.

494
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,561
It has no material value...

495
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,425
but it means a lot to me.

496
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,602
There.

497
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,671
Close your eyes. Wait a second.

498
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,838
Now?

499
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,744
No, wait. Wait.

500
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,041
It needed a touch of elegance.

501
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,209
Now.

502
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,027
There's the rub.

503
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,228
Mario. Ready to rehearse?

504
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,166
- What's with that?
- How about it?

505
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,567
How you like them apples?

506
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,201
Good. I like it.

507
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,812
What really gets to me
is the way the police treat you.

508
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,543
When the officer arrived,
what did you say to him?

509
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,050
You're not my type.

510
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,415
- That's just it.
- Why should I go with him?

511
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:10,324
If somebody comes up and says,
"Come with me," do you go?

512
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,829
As he is an authority,
it is your duty to go with him.

513
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,592
Just a minute. So, you, as an authority-

514
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,667
Yes, sir.

515
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,257
So you're an authority.

516
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,166
What do you need that for?

517
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,674
I'm saying that with your
backwards way of speaking...

518
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,674
we always end up in jail.

519
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,902
What do you mean?

520
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,638
You just gave testimony.

521
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,646
Why did you speak to the judge that way?

522
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,648
Because the judge asked me. Very well.

523
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,581
The judge is there, and you, as a man-

524
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,676
There you have it.
Just because he's a judge...

525
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:37,947
and while you are-

526
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:41,183
The guy's drunk.
Can't understand a word he says.

527
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,260
Shut up, you barfly!

528
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,919
What are you talking about?

529
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,429
How much did you imbibe?

530
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,761
Whatever you're buying. But not right now.

531
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,494
Can't you see I'm working?

532
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,504
- You're just a Cantina fly.
- Shut him up.

533
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,732
Give him a break, man.

534
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,366
As I was saying, you have no authority-

535
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,002
How do you know who I am?
I don't even know that.

536
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,978
You're a Cantina fly.

537
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,776
What's your name then?

538
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,277
Can't you hear that guy cackling like a hen?

539
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,022
Cantinfly. That's my name: Cantinflas.

540
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,038
They want to hire me for a new theater
they're opening near Garibaldi.

541
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,244
- What about the tent show, Mario?
- Tent shows are an endangered species.

542
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,354
You're right, kid.

543
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,351
Such are these modern times.

544
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,023
What are the conditions?

545
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,757
- That I join the union.
- And what about us?

546
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,891
- You aren't leaving, are you?
- Only if they give me what I asked for.

547
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,526
What did you ask for?

548
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,035
For my family to be included in the contract.

549
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,774
Valita.

550
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,042
My lovely Russian.

551
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,949
Will you be my wife?

552
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,519
Yes.

553
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,979
- Yes?
- Yes!

554
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,425
Make me a proud grandfather.

555
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,268
- Papa.
- Don Gregorio.

556
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,975
Watch the birdie.

557
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,843
One, two, three.

558
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,930
What are you thinking about, Mario?

559
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,198
Your father.

560
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,629
He's very proud of you.

561
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,270
Of us.

562
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,134
We have the most important things-

563
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,004
good health, work.

564
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,270
And soon this place will be full of kids.

565
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,077
Kids?

566
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,845
How many do you want?

567
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,920
A dozen would be nice.

568
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,347
At two pesos a show...

569
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,655
you'll have to work like a mule
to make ends meet.

570
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,431
Mondragón is going to book me
at the Follies Bergeres Theater.

571
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,501
Really?

572
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,202
- No.
- Yes.

573
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,600
- No!
- Yes.

574
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,832
Our life is going to change, Valita.
I promise.

575
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,309
But now we have another job to do.

576
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,179
What other job?

577
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,545
To start working on those babies.

578
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,649
Well, time's a-wastin'.

579
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,221
Let 'er rip.

580
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,459
Five days before the press conference.

581
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,861
Hey, Jacques. Sorry I'm late.

582
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,933
I'm still getting used
to the size of this city.

583
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,934
Don't worry. Let's get in.

584
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,305
- How are you?
- Fine.

585
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:30,651
So what's the catch here, Jacques?
Is the bull trained?

586
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,847
Sure they are trained.

587
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,185
Trained to kill.

588
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,351
What? You mean he really is in danger?

589
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:41,026
Mario is very passionate
about his art, Mike.

590
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,725
Many of these people
sacrifice a lot to come here.

591
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,428
I can see that. The place is packed.

592
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,368
You guys got a great product here.

593
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,806
Cantinflas is not simply a great product.

594
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:56,903
He's the most loved person in Mexico,
Spain and the rest of Latin America.

595
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,748
Really?

596
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,352
I didn't know that.

597
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:07,950
Four days before the press conference

598
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,184
Mike.

599
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,851
Please come in. Mario's waiting for us.

600
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:14,124
Good. I hope he's not raging
like yesterday's bull.

601
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,525
Mario, this is Michael Todd.

602
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,134
Nice to meet you, Mr. Todd. Come in.

603
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,668
Please call me Mike.

604
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,370
I'm sure glad you speak English, Mario.

605
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,674
Only when it's absolutely necessary.

606
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,306
Well, I can assure you
it's better than my Spanish.

607
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,408
I'm out of practice with the señoritas.

608
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,859
- I hear this is your first time.
- Oh, no.

609
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,330
I've seen my share of Mexico.
It's a beautiful country.

610
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,869
I mean the film, Mike.
This is your first one, right?

611
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:57,407
Yes, it is, but it's not my first production.
I come from Broadway, you see.

612
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,569
Oh, good. I also moved from theater to film.
It's a tough leap.

613
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,146
Anyway, I know who you are.

614
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,841
Um-Please tell me more about the picture.

615
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:12,150
I am gonna make this picture the biggest
box office success in the history of cinema.

616
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,383
That's why we need
the world's biggest stars.

617
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:18,484
Now, you come very highly recommended
as Mexico's top entertainer...

618
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,064
but I say it's time
for the entire world...

619
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,258
to get a glimpse of Cantinflas.

620
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,295
Is that so? The entire world?

621
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,030
Absolutely.

622
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,941
What do you have in mind?

623
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,442
For you, the most amazing scene
in the picture, okay?

624
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,709
You would play the chief of an Apache tribe
attacking a train.

625
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,408
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

626
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,542
One of your famous cameo roles?

627
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,349
Everybody wants to be part of this picture,
Mario. You are gonna love this.

628
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,352
Are you shooting in México?

629
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,761
Well, I would love to shoot in Mexico,
but the studio...

630
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,332
I see. I see. I see.

631
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,096
Yeah. Uh-We have a major
press conference next week.

632
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,967
The entire planet's gonna be watching us.

633
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:03,733
I'm sure I will enjoy your movie, Mike...

634
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:08,210
but unfortunately we are not interested
in working for a studio.

635
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,272
Well, I certainly can understand that,
Mario, but, uh-

636
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,045
how do you plan on
financing the picture...

637
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,279
if we don't work with the system?

638
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,549
Money is never a problem.

639
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,646
No?

640
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,393
No.

641
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,662
Mario has received several offers
from Hollywood, mostly for leading roles.

642
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,701
Your offer is simply unacceptable.

643
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:39,637
Well, Mario, would you at least do me
the honor of reading our screenplay?

644
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,370
Sure. I will. I will.

645
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:46,108
But honestly, Mike, I don't think
that's gonna change my decision.

646
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,683
Thank you very much for coming.

647
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,345
- All right. Thank you, Mario.
- Thank you, Mike.

648
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,159
Take care.

649
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,455
Bye.

650
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,457
I didn't know about the Apaches, Mario.

651
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,400
Jacques.

652
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,871
Let's get serious.

653
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,103
- Come on.
- I don't get it.

654
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,180
- Hurry.
- We can afford to take a cab.

655
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,748
Follies Bergeres Theater.

656
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,111
What's wrong with him?

657
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,052
Let me try that.

658
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,719
Manuel, you're the best comedian
in Mexico.

659
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,724
May we assimilate, sir?

660
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,457
- Hello.
- Hello.

661
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,963
You must be that Cantinflas guy.

662
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,027
Fabriqué en la France.
Brightest match in the batch.

663
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,037
Qu'est-ce que c'´ est ça?
Les Champs-Elysées?

664
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,970
This is Valentina, my wife.

665
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,166
- How do you-
- No, no.

666
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,870
Your dressing room is in the back.
Do me a favor and don't disturb me.

667
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,248
With great pleasure.

668
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,338
Asshole.

669
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,917
Come on, Valita.

670
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,716
"Fabriqué en la France. Champs-Élysées."

671
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:04,293
"Oui, oui, oui. " You bet.

672
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,361
Mario.

673
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,699
I told you.

674
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,283
It's not that bad.

675
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,987
Trash, Mr. Furstenberg.

676
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,718
Medel treats us like trash.

677
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,090
Since we got here,
he constantly humiliates us.

678
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:41,653
What do you want me to do? He's the star!

679
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,397
That's just another word for impostor.

680
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,367
- What?
- Look, Don José.

681
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,202
He put us in a storeroom.

682
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,240
He changes the order of the acts
without notice.

683
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,070
And he took our names off the marquee...

684
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:54,804
to put his up in bigger letters.

685
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,972
And who packs the theater? You or Medel?

686
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,312
- But our act is good.
- Sure it is.

687
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:03,579
That's why everybody
comes to see Cantinflas.

688
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:07,618
How can they come to see us
if we're not even advertised?

689
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:11,888
I'm not spending on publicity
for complete unknowns.

690
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,021
- We have our audience.
- People who can't afford a ticket.

691
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,690
Is that what you think? All right.

692
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,202
I respect that.

693
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,168
For me, all thoughts are respectable...

694
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:23,068
be they small-minded or fat-headed.

695
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,075
- What?
- Never mind.

696
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,673
Listen, clown.

697
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,173
You better start thinking
of other characters.

698
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,684
I've just about had it
with this little bum!

699
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,348
Damn!

700
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,949
Well, why not talk with Mondragón?

701
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,528
And get us deeper in trouble?

702
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,358
Then how about changing your character?

703
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,159
Never. Cantinflas is Cantinflas.

704
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,962
Mario, we need people to come see us.

705
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,264
- Got another?
- No, I'm out.

706
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,331
Want a newspaper?

707
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,803
Cantinflas. What are you doing here?

708
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,111
We work here now.

709
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,581
Great.

710
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,380
More or less. Nobody comes to see us.

711
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,216
What do you expect?

712
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,381
You have to announce it on the front page.

713
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,450
Yeah, do I look rich?

714
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,529
If you want, I'll spread the word.

715
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,825
- On the level?
- Even stephen.

716
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,394
Wait.

717
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,027
Here goes.

718
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,401
Coming soon! Don't miss it!

719
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,205
Who's that?

720
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,936
A pal. He'll help us out.

721
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,671
Yeah? How?

722
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,572
As was said by the poet...

723
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:41,116
who never said a thing
because time ran out...

724
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,153
"Let us act either as what we are,
or as gentlemen."

725
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,282
Sometimes I need a dictionary
to understand you.

726
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,855
All who hear the sound of my voice...

727
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,156
I am here before you...

728
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,197
and you before me...

729
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,359
and that is a truth that no one can deny.

730
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,266
And now I wonder, why am I here?

731
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:02,998
And my answer is coming right away.

732
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:07,941
I am here because I am not anywhere else
and because you called me.

733
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,876
And if the people call upon me...

734
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,380
then they must have a reason for it.

735
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,053
As for myself, contrary to what
was said by a certain someone...

736
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,922
who shall remain unnamed...

737
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,824
but who I see right now...

738
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,431
I don't represent any union.

739
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,797
And I don't represent any union
because I simply represent myself.

740
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,631
Because, as the saying goes...

741
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,831
"Better to be alone than in bad company."

742
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,807
And you well may wonder,
if this young man of such a tender age...

743
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,752
of such extinguished bearing,
of such pleasing and regular portions...

744
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,982
will be able to bring the ship
to safe harbor?

745
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,993
Can he negotiate the perils
and find the refuge of happiness...

746
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,563
where he may leave us
entirely safe and sound?

747
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,534
And this same fellow,
yours truly, I might venture to add...

748
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,762
will answer.

749
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:12,071
This spring chicken
is cockier than a rooster!

750
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,576
And above all, I want to do justice...

751
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,273
and give the people what they need.

752
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,022
And I, unlike some others...

753
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,460
will give you bread, and lots of it.

754
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,088
Not just crumbs,
as they have always given you.

755
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,802
I don't want them here at all.

756
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,771
I can't understand why you agreed to it.

757
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,709
But, Manuel, I accepted
because of union politicking.

758
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,303
And you expect to compete
with the Lírico Theater like that?

759
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,542
The Follies
is not for the tent show crowd.

760
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,880
What are you afraid of, Manuel?

761
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,318
Afraid?

762
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,890
I pity them.

763
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:41,823
Three days before the press conference.

764
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,495
Hello. I'm meeting an associate.

765
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,000
- How are you, Mike?
- I'm great. Where's John?

766
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,978
- John won't be joining us.
- I'll have to take a rain check.

767
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,605
I've got my hands full
with this press conference and-

768
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,513
I spoke to Gelman, Mike.

769
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:15,520
I've always known
Mario Moreno is not coming.

770
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,389
- Is that so?
- The game is up, Mike.

771
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,492
I'm taking this production away from you.

772
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,225
You listen here, you snake.

773
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,769
I brought this project to United Artists,
and I can take it away.

774
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,897
And you know as well as I do
that you can't take this project anywhere...

775
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,842
unless you pay every cent
the studio has spent on your set...

776
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:39,313
fancy dinner and your-whoo!-
whole crazy lifestyle.

777
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,577
At least I have a lifestyle.
You've got neither-

778
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,313
no life, no style-and you never will.

779
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:47,419
This conversation is over.

780
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:49,924
This conversation was over
before it began.

781
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:01,898
- My apologies, sir.
- No, no, no.

782
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,303
I apologize for eavesdropping, but-

783
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,936
Well, I could hardly avoid listening
to your conversation.

784
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,142
- May I sit down?
- Of course.

785
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,217
Um, from what I gather...

786
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,377
it would appear there's some challenge...

787
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,116
involving getting Mario Moreno-
Cantinflas...

788
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,953
to appear in your picture.

789
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,425
Well, he's already turned me down.

790
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,593
Hmm. What exactly was his response?

791
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,964
He said he does not work for studios.

792
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,000
Hmm. Sometimes freedom has its price...

793
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,575
but it's always something
worth aspiring to.

794
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,801
Actually, this same studio was built
by people who wanted that kind of freedom.

795
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,542
Now, you see, it seems we've become
everything we tried to escape.

796
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,051
- Don't lose your faith, Mr. Todd.
- Thank you, sir.

797
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,453
And a word of advice, if I may be so bold.

798
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:06,560
Perhaps next time,
you should try to talk to Cantinflas...

799
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,262
not to Mr. Moreno.

800
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,498
I don't see what the difference
would be, Mr.-

801
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,735
Charlie. My friends call me Charlie.

802
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,051
Oh, my God.

803
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,420
THERE'S THE RUB

804
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:32,586
Churubusco Studios.

805
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,392
There's the rub, man.

806
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,160
Damn it. Cut!

807
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:43,371
Listen, Mario. I don't know
how you're used to working...

808
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:46,169
but here, you have to stick to the script.

809
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,937
I only improvise to improve the dialogue.

810
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,512
Why?

811
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,876
Just do your job.

812
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,610
- Precisely.
- Not one word outside the script!

813
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,414
Ready? Camera.

814
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,853
Lights.

815
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,423
Silence, please, everyone.

816
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:06,285
There's the Rub, scene 21, take 7.

817
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,363
And...

818
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,022
Action.

819
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:14,793
This man has been hiding
behind a false name, and I will prove it.

820
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,434
Now, my friend.

821
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,942
- What do you go by?
- I get by with my wits.

822
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,707
- You're ignorant.
- Don't insult me!

823
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:26,076
Your Honor, I prot-

824
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,979
Step outside, man.

825
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,779
I can't take it, Your Honor.
He insults me.

826
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:34,255
You're the big shot here, you should
behave correctly with such individuals-

827
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,985
Why don't you go outside? Let me go, sir.

828
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:40,620
- You're right. Please excuse me.
- You may be excused.

829
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,165
Just answer the question.

830
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,325
Didn't I answer already?

831
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,097
- What is your name?
- All right. No need to yell.

832
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,434
Which one? The first one or the one after?

833
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,373
- Just as I told you!
- Yes, sir. And there's the rub.

834
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,910
Let the record state that this man...

835
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,243
had one name first and another after that.

836
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,075
Members of the jury...

837
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:05,154
you must know that this man
has posed as a certain Cantinflas...

838
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,688
to conceal his identity.

839
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,622
You've got it backward, man.

840
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,987
Cantinflas first.

841
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:14,120
The thing is, afterwards, you know,
they look at you and this and that.

842
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,131
And a man has his feelings.
So then it was Don Mario...

843
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,793
- That's what I said!
- Oh. All right.

844
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,872
- Sorry, old man.
- Who are you calling old man? Cut!

845
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,435
All right then. Let's cut for lunch.

846
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,511
One hour everyone, please.

847
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:36,884
If this little actor keeps this up,
the movie will be a major flop.

848
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,351
Relax, sir.

849
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,913
I'm telling you. A huge flop!

850
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,539
THERE'S THE RUB

851
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,142
Jacques Gelman
is a good friend of mine, Mario.

852
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,409
And he is very interested in your career.

853
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,379
He wants to help you grow.

854
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,250
I don't like being exploited.

855
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,222
It's about having control.

856
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,054
I need complete creative freedom.

857
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,586
You have the talent. I have the money.

858
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,154
If we team up...

859
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:28,067
Cantinflas will be
the biggest comedian on the continent.

860
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,943
- Complete freedom?
- Of course.

861
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:37,105
I guarantee a gold mine.

862
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,615
All right.

863
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,208
All right, Jacques.

864
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,786
And if a sacrifice is called for...

865
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,913
I can always give up my share
and take yours.

866
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:51,720
Neither Blood nor Sand, scene 77 take 7.

867
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:53,319
And...

868
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,090
Action!

869
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,226
Money is everything in life.

870
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,200
- Who told you that?
- Life.

871
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,670
- What do you know about life?
- Don't I?

872
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,001
You innocent babe.

873
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,633
Life, mister, must be seized.

874
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,838
Money, all things considered, of course.

875
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,007
Look, when I talk physiologically
dealing with a situation...

876
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,142
we might call physiological.

877
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,312
- Because money, as Spearshaker said-
- Spearshaker?

878
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,117
- Shakespeare.
- That's his cousin from Toluca.

879
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,455
- What cousin from Toluca? Cut!
- Not again.

880
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,029
Now what? It was going fine.

881
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,429
- You don't know your lines, Mario.
- Obviously. That's the way I am.

882
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,000
I can't work like that, Mario.

883
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,296
I remind you that I'm
responsible for this film.

884
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,531
I leave nothing to improvisation.

885
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,131
Can you imagine me improvising?

886
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,005
We owe it all to the screenplay, Mario.

887
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,204
Every word is there for a reason.

888
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,181
And we can't just go
changing them at will!

889
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,818
You're fired.

890
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,362
On the Set
of The Unknown Policeman.

891
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:03,762
All right, now.
Where the heck is my coffee?

892
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,265
Mario, do you need anything?

893
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,463
Here?

894
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,041
Gabriel, is this is my light?

895
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,977
Okay.

896
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,875
- No. Let's get started.
- All right.

897
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,777
- Ready, Mr. Figueroa?
- Yes, sir.

898
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,849
Ready. Roll it.

899
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,542
Rolling.

900
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,676
Slate it.

901
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:28,783
And...

902
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:32,962
Action.

903
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,690
At your service, chief.

904
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,758
Thus Moreno enters
the major leagues of entertainment...

905
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,861
not only as performer...

906
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,599
but also as director.

907
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,573
What's wrong? Aren't you glad?

908
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,150
Yes. Of course I am.

909
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,847
Our life has changed completely.

910
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,917
Yes.

911
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,161
What's wrong?

912
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,634
Nothing. The more you work,
the less I see you.

913
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,371
If you're not filming, you're on tour.

914
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,503
And now with your appointment
to the Actors Association...

915
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,081
you spend all day at the office.

916
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,212
There's the rub.
It's not one thing or the other-

917
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,786
Stop it already, Mario.

918
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,323
I miss you.

919
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,721
And every time I want to talk,
you start fooling around.

920
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,689
But, Valita-

921
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,860
My pretty Russian.

922
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,233
You know I do it all for you.

923
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,372
It's just...

924
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,943
I don't know if I'm talking to you
or to Cantinflas.

925
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,939
I miss you, Mario. You, my husband.

926
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,478
Not Cantinflas.

927
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,911
How can you say that?

928
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,925
You don't understand.

929
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:15,063
I told you we shouldn't have moved
into this house. It's huge.

930
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,361
What am I going to do here?
I'll feel even lonelier.

931
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,402
No. Lonely?

932
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:23,931
I'm afraid.

933
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,805
Valita.

934
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,641
I love you.

935
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,545
I love you with all my heart.

936
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,084
And we will be together always.

937
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,280
Really?

938
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,581
Always.

939
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,666
I have to go.

940
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,960
See you later.

941
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,847
Mario, stop looking at your watch.

942
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,746
They'll think you aren't comfortable.

943
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,318
And they'd be right.

944
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,546
They're all scoundrels here.

945
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,724
As leader of the Actors Association...

946
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,163
you must maintain good relations
with the heads of the other unions.

947
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,924
I suspect no one.

948
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,900
But I mistrust everyone, Jorge.

949
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,101
Silence, please.

950
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,534
Fidel. It's an honor to raise this glass...

951
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:44,311
and wish you a long life
as head of the CTM.

952
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:46,343
Cheers.

953
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,557
Who's that dimwit?

954
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,422
One of Fidel's men.

955
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:56,996
They say he's the next head
of the Film Workers Union.

956
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,268
For you.

957
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,144
For your family.

958
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,076
Then we're done for.

959
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,816
No?

960
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,332
Charlie. I'm glad I found you.

961
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,133
Two days before the press conference.

962
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,140
You almost missed me.

963
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,574
I'm off to Europe in a few hours.

964
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,441
I really need your help, Charlie.

965
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,147
Hmm.

966
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,884
Moreno-lvanova Residence.

967
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,104
Valita!

968
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,119
What's the matter?

969
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,396
What happened? Where is the help? Aurora!

970
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,969
I sent them away.
I don't want to see anyone.

971
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,205
Valita. How can I help you?

972
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,539
Help me?

973
01:06:25,948 --> 01:06:28,212
I needed you all this time.

974
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,179
Especially today. I needed you today.

975
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:33,915
We had assembly-

976
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,321
Gosh! The doctor's appointment.

977
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,595
I forgot.

978
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,323
Forgive me.

979
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,356
What did he say?

980
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,738
What did he tell you, Valita?

981
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,940
That...

982
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,843
This can't be. There must be a mistake.

983
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,572
We can't have children.

984
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,145
We can't.

985
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:30,270
If I talk to you like this,
in this paternal tone...

986
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,839
A Day with the Devil.

987
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,341
Like a father to a son
who's turned out to be a real devil...

988
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,911
Look, I'm not holding back here.

989
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,843
Because you're a devil I really like...

990
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,246
a very charming devil,
a really cool devil.

991
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:44,012
Don't get me wrong.
I think there's a solution.

992
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,111
That's what I needed...

993
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,792
a good soul like yours so I could cry.

994
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:55,262
Because he who can cry is saved.

995
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,125
Don't cry, man.

996
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:02,396
Don't cry, my little devil.

997
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,700
Can't you see that your tears burn?

998
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,367
Don't cry, my little devil.
Act like a man.

999
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,670
Buck up.

1000
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,404
You'll make me cry too.

1001
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,481
Besides, what don't you understand?

1002
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:15,573
Why are you crying?
Why don't you pull yourself together?

1003
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,710
Work. Work purifies.

1004
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:21,119
Have you ever worked?

1005
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,488
I've never worked,
but I hope to retire very soon.

1006
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,623
Cut and print. Very good. Very good.

1007
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:33,129
- You don't want another take?
- Not at all. What for?

1008
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:36,796
With Cantinflas and Don Andrés Soler,
it's top-notch.

1009
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,840
- Right, guys?
- Yes.

1010
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,205
- Thanks, Andrés.
- Not at all.

1011
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,575
Mario. Everyone be here tomorrow at 9:00.

1012
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,581
Can someone remove my horns, please?

1013
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,316
Start without me tomorrow.
I'll be a little late.

1014
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,116
- Why?
- I'm godfather at a christening.

1015
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,384
How's Valentina doing?

1016
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,184
Down in the dumps.

1017
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:00,387
Excuse me.

1018
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:05,491
Well, the baptism comes at a bad time.

1019
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,068
I couldn't get out of it.

1020
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:10,866
At least we finished early.
Take care of her, pamper her, surprise her.

1021
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,600
- Thank you, Miguel.
- All right.

1022
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,036
A word with the art department
over here, please.

1023
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,738
DRESSING ROOM.

1024
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,456
National Actors Association.

1025
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:44,897
When I ran for representative
of my fellow actors...

1026
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:48,033
they asked what I would do
to benefit our organization.

1027
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,442
In our quest for transparency...

1028
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:54,675
we denounce the embezzlement
and misuse of funds...

1029
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,981
which, under the protection
of Salvador Carrillo...

1030
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,578
has left the country's film industry
in a shambles.

1031
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,247
I won't stand for this!

1032
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,083
Sit down.

1033
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,028
Here and now...

1034
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,260
we propose the creation of a new union...

1035
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:19,205
to put an end to the private dealings
of this band of thieves!

1036
01:11:19,975 --> 01:11:21,943
Stop! This is intolerable!

1037
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,841
You're corrupt, Carrillo.

1038
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,708
You two-bit clown!

1039
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,486
Thief!

1040
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,952
You're corrupt!

1041
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:40,994
Order!

1042
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:44,031
Calm down! Order!

1043
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,530
Gentlemen, order!

1044
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,865
They hit you where it hurts, man.

1045
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:54,042
- We're with you, Mario.
- Thank you, Jorge.

1046
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,701
There's strength in numbers.

1047
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,871
Do you want a steak? For your eye?

1048
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,448
Only if it's well done.

1049
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,078
CHURUBUSCO STUDIOS.

1050
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,898
Get ready, guys! Here they come!

1051
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,109
No, no. Don't shoot.

1052
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,837
What is it, Gabriel?

1053
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,412
It's "El lndio."

1054
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,617
What's new, you sons of guns?

1055
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,695
Thought you could have
a shoot-out without me?

1056
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:48,889
Come in, compadre.

1057
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,564
President Ávila Camacho
has asked the leaders...

1058
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,504
to settle their differences
through peaceful dialogue.

1059
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:05,110
Nevertheless,
Moreno organized a mass march...

1060
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:10,846
joined by workers of Churubusco Studios
and the A ctors A ssociation.

1061
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,928
Actors united for a new union!

1062
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,666
Actors united for a new union!

1063
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,069
Celebrities like Miroslava Stern...

1064
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:39,636
Charito Granados, Jorge Mondragón,
Emilio "lndio" Fernández...

1065
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:43,081
Meche Barba,
Agustín lnsunza, Mapy Cortés...

1066
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,517
Tito Guízar, Dolores del Rio...

1067
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:49,113
Ernesto Alonso, Fanny Kaufman " Vitola,"
Gabriel Figueroa...

1068
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,488
Pedro Armendáriz, Sofía Álvarez...

1069
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,461
Fernando Soto "Mantequilla,"
Gloria Marín, Jorge Negrete...

1070
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:59,125
María Félix, Andrés Soler
and Lupita Tovar.

1071
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:09,877
The March of the Stars
brought immediate results.

1072
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:13,812
The president supported
the coexistence of both unions...

1073
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:18,114
which brings to an end
Salvador Carrillo's monopoly of power.

1074
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,984
Fabulous.

1075
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,061
This is the genius I love.

1076
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,331
Next stop, Hollywood.

1077
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,762
Straight to the Oscars.

1078
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,971
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1079
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,375
Mario Moreno is getting a lot of attention
from gossip columnists...

1080
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,284
since he has frequently been seen
together with Miroslava Stern...

1081
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:55,413
star of the film
An Adventure in the Night.

1082
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,170
Don't listen to that nonsense.

1083
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:11,762
It's just work.

1084
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,270
Do you want sugar?

1085
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,280
Mr. Todd, are you going to be okay?

1086
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,144
One day before the press conference

1087
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,582
I'm fine, Billy. You did send that script
to Cantinflas, right?

1088
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:26,744
Yes, like you told me. Yeah.

1089
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,816
I assume you want me to cancel the lunch
with John and Maurice...

1090
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,394
before the press conference.

1091
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,793
- They'll be expecting Cantinflas.
- Stop working.

1092
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:39,459
Kid, you're gonna be fine.
I see a bright future ahead for you.

1093
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,908
Well, sir, I have to say
it's been a pleasure.

1094
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:52,310
- Same here, my friend. You take care.
- Yeah.

1095
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,481
Oh, I almost forgot.

1096
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,555
I left Miss Taylor your message.

1097
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:04,290
- I do hope she gets back to you.
- You can bet she will.

1098
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,860
Yeah.

1099
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,387
Just look at this scene.

1100
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,490
The crème de la crème of Mexican cinema.

1101
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:22,502
I drink to Mario Moreno.

1102
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,330
Our leader.

1103
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,103
He who fights for the good
of his fellow man.

1104
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,975
My colleagues, I apologize.

1105
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:34,242
- Clearly the gentleman is in no condition-
- I found you in the gutter, Mario.

1106
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,551
Don't you remember?

1107
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,814
I picked you up out of the mud.

1108
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,947
Don't you recognize me?

1109
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:46,255
You had a falling out with Manolín,
but this is neither the time nor the place.

1110
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:47,419
- When?
- Tomorrow.

1111
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,429
- When?
- Tomorrow.

1112
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,796
- Do you need money?
- Money?

1113
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,528
That's all you have, Mario.

1114
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:58,197
Money, your buildings
and your cars and your ranches.

1115
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,773
- But you know what?
- Tomorrow.

1116
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,934
There's something I have
that you never will.

1117
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,409
What's that?

1118
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,080
Children.

1119
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,111
You can keep your filthy money.

1120
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,926
The party will go on. You know him.

1121
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,556
The party will go on.

1122
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,000
THEATER OF THE INSURGENTS
PREMIERE.

1123
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,015
Thanks.

1124
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,089
Thanks.

1125
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:56,096
- Don Mario, a pleasure.
- How are you?

1126
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,134
Hi. How are you?

1127
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,507
A photo.

1128
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:14,848
I'm telling you,
if I see your brother-in-law here...

1129
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,508
I'll have him thrown out.

1130
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,950
I don't think he cares one bit
about your mural.

1131
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,123
You're on his side?

1132
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:25,993
Tell me.

1133
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:30,853
- Valentina, so nice to see you.
- How are you?

1134
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,433
Mario, are you ready for the inauguration?

1135
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,695
As always. And you?

1136
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,338
Take it easy, Mario.

1137
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,236
They're waiting for you to cut the ribbon.

1138
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,774
Excuse me.

1139
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,945
Ladies and gentlemen...

1140
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:52,179
we are here to inaugurate this mural.

1141
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:44,672
Valita.

1142
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,269
- Valentina. Where are you going?
- Let me go. I don't want to stay here.

1143
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:51,675
Wait. Where are you going?
Let me take you home.

1144
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,611
No, no. You don't understand.

1145
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:55,273
I don't want to be with you anymore.

1146
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,645
I can't. I don't know you.

1147
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,111
But I'm the same.

1148
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,387
Look at you. Look.

1149
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,522
Look at that mural. Look.

1150
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,792
Whose side are you on?

1151
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,691
You're surrounded by unscrupulous people.

1152
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,226
And you are the worst.

1153
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,772
You betray the one who loves you.

1154
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,366
- Valita...
- Let go of me.

1155
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,530
I've had it up to here with you!

1156
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,625
I can't take it anymore!

1157
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,795
I can't take it anymore.

1158
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,672
What am I saying?

1159
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:38,277
What am I doing?

1160
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,821
What am I saying?

1161
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,199
Did you specify it was Los Angeles time?

1162
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,293
Mexico's on a different time zone.

1163
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,701
I'm sorry. Is there something
funny about this, Maurice?

1164
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:35,401
I don't know if "funny"
is exactly the word.

1165
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,844
What do you think, Mike?

1166
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,517
I have enough water.
No más. ¿ Comprende?

1167
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,086
Damn greasers.

1168
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,055
Here's the joke, John.

1169
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,957
Here we are, 30 minutes away
from the press conference...

1170
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:56,758
and Mike forgot to mention something.

1171
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:02,033
What are you talking about, Maurice?

1172
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:04,196
Mario Moreno is not coming.

1173
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,234
Is that true, Mike?

1174
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,677
Have you been bullshitting me
this whole time?

1175
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:14,874
- Well...
- You're out!

1176
01:24:14,983 --> 01:24:16,780
Maurice is taking over the production.

1177
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:22,655
Goddamn you, Mike,
for wasting my time and my money.

1178
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:26,284
Well, I can't deny that Moreno turned down
the part we offered him.

1179
01:24:26,394 --> 01:24:28,453
It was a crazy idea. Okay.

1180
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,929
At least you come to your sense.

1181
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,728
Well, you're the one with all
the Hollywood experience, Maurice.

1182
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:38,329
Can you imagine Mario Moreno
working for peanuts?

1183
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,567
Money is not everything in life!

1184
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,641
- Jesus.
- Nice to finally meet you, Mr.-

1185
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,976
Mr. Moreno. This is...

1186
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:50,812
Did you notice my good friend Frank
at the piano?

1187
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,580
Frankie! Frankie!

1188
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:54,922
Here, take this, pal.

1189
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:57,116
- Sinatra.
- Yeah.

1190
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,090
This is incredible.

1191
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:03,924
Mike-Mike, I'm sorry
I ever doubted you, okay?

1192
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:07,024
So-Well, what are we
gonna do about the press conference?

1193
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:10,127
Well, um-Uh, the issue-

1194
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,832
Well, why don't-
Why don't you go right ahead, Mario?

1195
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:18,174
Okay. Mike was very kind
to offer me the lead role of Passepartout.

1196
01:25:18,813 --> 01:25:20,906
What? A Mexican playing Passepartout?

1197
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,642
- Mais ça, c'est pas possible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

1198
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,446
Now wait a minute.
We-We never discussed anything like that.

1199
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:27,817
There's the rub, man.

1200
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:32,322
In my humble opinion,
this project will be the biggest...

1201
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:36,056
the most entertaining
motion picture in all of history.

1202
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:39,327
Unfortunately, United Artists
will not be producing with us.

1203
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:43,097
But assuming we can reach an agreement
with them-which I hope we can-

1204
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:44,728
they can always help us release it.

1205
01:25:44,839 --> 01:25:46,807
How much is this movie going to cost?

1206
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:48,637
Oh, around six million dollars.

1207
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:50,836
How are you paying for it?

1208
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:55,314
Um, let's just say I have many good friends
all around the world.

1209
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:04,258
CANTINFLAS
KING OF THE TENT SHOWS.

1210
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,967
Thank you for coming.

1211
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,371
What's all this?

1212
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:27,373
My way of telling you I'm back.

1213
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,811
And this time it's for good.

1214
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,725
He who strays too far
and owns up to the same...

1215
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,986
exhibits true courage
by accepting the blame.

1216
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:42,758
And there's the rub.

1217
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:50,394
How you like them apples?

1218
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:53,403
How long will you be away?

1219
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,767
As long as you wish, Valita.

1220
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,976
Because this time, you're coming with me.

1221
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:09,413
I won't shoot a single scene
unless you're by my side.

1222
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,387
My pretty Russian.

1223
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,372
I'm going to ask two things of you.

1224
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:33,439
Don't do that Cantinflas thing in English.

1225
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:41,019
- And pamper me a lot.
- I promise.

1226
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:42,282
All the time.

1227
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,302
Around the World in Eighty Days.

1228
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,756
Very good, Mario.

1229
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:18,621
You're gonna have to teach me
that dance, all right?

1230
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:39,312
And cut!

1231
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:41,747
I'm getting cold just watching you boys.

1232
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,316
That's a wrap, everyone.

1233
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:45,352
Well done, gentlemen.

1234
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,117
Thank you all. Good day.

1235
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,096
I hate to say I told you so.

1236
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:58,165
Well, let's be honest.

1237
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,734
Nobody actually hates to say
"I told you so."

1238
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,667
We want to release this film
simultaneously in 125 cities.

1239
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:07,502
Do you think United Artists can handle it?

1240
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:11,408
Or do you want to be famous for letting go
of the greatest movie of all time twice?

1241
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,187
So, Mario, tell me.

1242
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,227
When are you moving to LA?

1243
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:29,489
I've got tons of new ideas.

1244
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:32,065
- I have other plans, Mike.
- Other plans?

1245
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:34,396
We've conquered Hollywood.
You can't go now.

1246
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:38,666
Mmm. Now I know where my place is-

1247
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:41,503
among my people in México...

1248
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,076
with my wife.

1249
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,942
We are thinking of adopting a baby.

1250
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,439
Now I understand.

1251
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,882
That's a good reason. Well-

1252
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,789
- You'll be missed, my friend.
- You too, Mike.

1253
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,414
I'll drink to that.

1254
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:02,653
There's the rub, man!

1255
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:06,258
Golden Globe Awards.

1256
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:08,301
Whoa.

1257
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,564
My bookie's got us at 4-to-1, Jimmy.

1258
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:14,232
And I'm saying he's nuts.
Am I right? See ya.

1259
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:20,637
Steve, there's a gin rummy game
going on in the press room.

1260
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:24,184
I expect you to be there.
Hope to see you. All right.

1261
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,156
All right, gentlemen,
now, I expect you to catch my good side.

1262
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,159
There's always only good sides on her.

1263
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,122
Mario.

1264
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:40,132
Mr. Brando, over here.

1265
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:43,229
Mr. Brando! Right here!

1266
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:45,972
Mr. Brando!
Mr. Brando! Please, sir!

1267
01:30:46,073 --> 01:30:47,870
Right here!

1268
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:01,314
And here are the nominees
for Best Actor...

1269
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:05,119
in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

1270
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:09,396
And the nominees are:

1271
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:13,193
Yul Brynner for The King and I.

1272
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,906
Marlon Brando for The Teahouse
of the August Moon.

1273
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:40,987
Cantinflas for Around the World
in Eighty Days.

1274
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,568
And the winner is...

1275
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:05,016
Mario Moreno... Cantinflas...
for Around the World in Eighty Days.

1276
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:10,115
