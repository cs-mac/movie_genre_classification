1
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:56,387
<i>When I was 15, and my family</i>
<i>came to the island for the summer... </i>

2
00:02:57,126 --> 00:03:01,256
<i>... there weren't nearly as many houses</i>
<i>or people as there are now. </i>

3
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,600
<i>The geography of the island</i>
<i>and the singularity of the sea... </i>

4
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,698
<i>... were far more noticeable then. </i>

5
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:16,571
<i>And if a guy wasn't to die of loneliness,</i>
<i>his family made certain... </i>

6
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:21,879
<i>... that other families from his neighborhood</i>
<i>contributed other kids to the island. </i>

7
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:33,087
Look out, Hermie.

8
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:35,191
Look out.

9
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,665
<i>Present with me in the summer of '42... </i>

10
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,327
<i>... were Oscy, my best friend. </i>

11
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:46,699
<i>And Benjie, my next to best friend. </i>

12
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,837
<i>We called ourselves "The Terrible Trio. "</i>

13
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,625
<i>And that house up there... </i>

14
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,328
<i>... that was her house. </i>

15
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:15,196
<i>And nothing, from that first day I saw her... </i>

16
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:18,840
<i>... and no one</i>
<i>that has happened to me since... </i>

17
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,878
<i>... has ever been as frightening</i>
<i>and as confusing. </i>

18
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:27,277
<i>For no person I've ever known... </i>

19
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:32,014
<i>... has ever done more</i>
<i>to make me feeI more sure... </i>

20
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,520
<i>... more insecure... </i>

21
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,657
<i>... more important... </i>

22
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,454
<i>... and less significant. </i>

23
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,829
He's gonna take her
right into that bedroom.

24
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,627
He better put the wood down first.

25
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,070
Funny.

26
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,499
Hey, come on!

27
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,303
Oscy, for Christ's sakes!

28
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,208
Hey, come on, Hermie.
Will you move your ass, please?

29
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,927
Give it back, Oscy!

30
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,676
Boy, I'd like to feel every one of those girls.

31
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,089
You know, I should've tripped on them.
They'd never know I was getting a feel.

32
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:20,253
That's not the way to do it.

33
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,126
So what is the way to do it?

34
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,292
You have to say things.

35
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,128
All right, so I'll say, '<i>'</i>Excuse me. '<i>'</i>

36
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,394
You know what I mean.

37
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,138
You just can't go up to a girl
and fall on her.

38
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,937
- It isn't done.
- Why not?

39
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,578
I did it with Gladys Potter.

40
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,882
She was only 12 years old.
What did she know?

41
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,877
I don't know.
She didn't seem to mind though.

42
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,314
Well, she was surprised.

43
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,021
Hell, so was I. She had nothing to feel.

44
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,285
Come on, Benjie, stop dragging.

45
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,597
I don't know what's gonna become of him.

46
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,057
He has no emotions.

47
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,727
He's just confused.

48
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,305
Yeah. So am I.

49
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,878
I've been waking up lately,
in the middle of the night.

50
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:13,475
A lot.

51
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,183
Yeah, that's okay. I do, too.

52
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,378
- You do?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:27,121
I wake up feeling crazy
and thinking about Vera Miller.

54
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:32,329
- So what?
- So, I hate Vera Miller.

55
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,726
Jesus!

56
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:36,494
You think I'm in love with her?

57
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,640
I don't know.

58
00:07:41,077 --> 00:07:44,240
I hope I'm not in love with her. I hate her!

59
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,943
What kind of thoughts
do you have about her?

60
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,243
Well, I forget.

61
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,317
- Then how can I help you?
- Who the hell is asking you to help me?

62
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,724
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing you'd understand.

63
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,486
Screw you!

64
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:03,924
Yeah, that's your whole problem, Benjie.

65
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:07,193
You're only interested in screwing me.

66
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,137
- Why don't you try screwing a girl?
- Okay.

67
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,607
'<i>'</i>Okay,'<i>'</i> he says. Boy, that's something.

68
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,175
- You wouldn't know the first thing to do.
- I would so!

69
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,048
Okay, what's the first thing you do?

70
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,042
You feel them.

71
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:23,977
Wrong! You kiss them.

72
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,353
We didn't kiss Gladys Potter.

73
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,216
We weren't in love with Gladys Potter.

74
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:32,520
If you're in love with a girl,
you're supposed to kiss her first.

75
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,063
- Ain't that right, Hermie?
- It's polite.

76
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,092
It's not required.

77
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,462
It's required, you ninny!

78
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:41,166
It is not!

79
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:42,869
How do you know?

80
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,164
Because I found a book.

81
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:02,824
If my mother knew I took that book<i>... </i>
It doesn't belong to me.

82
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:06,020
It doesn't belong to my mother.
It belongs to the house.

83
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:13,129
If you guys get your fingerprints
on those pages, it's your funeral.

84
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,136
My mother's gonna miss that book!

85
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:21,438
It's the biggest on the shelf.
Ten books fell when I pulled it out.

86
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,034
- Hold it!
- Will you hurry up?

87
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,580
Kill me. I don't read as fast as you do.

88
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:30,744
Okay, turn.

89
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,753
Jesus! Do you believe all this stuff?.

90
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,695
It's a medical journal.
Why should they lie?

91
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,226
How do they take pictures like that?

92
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:48,333
- They must have special cameras.
- What drugstores would develop them?

93
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:52,033
If we took film like that to Sanders,
we'd be put in a reform school.

94
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,206
I guess they develop them themselves.

95
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,712
Yeah, I guess that's what they do.

96
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:02,173
- Let me look.
- Go away. You'll foam at the mouth.

97
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,242
- It's my book.
- Come on, let him look.

98
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,516
There, they're doing it!

99
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,128
- I don't believe it.
- You'd better believe it.

100
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,165
One day your turn will come
and you'd better know what to do.

101
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,168
I don't believe it.
My mother and father never did that!

102
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,265
- Never.
- Why not?

103
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:23,799
Because it's stupid!

104
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,740
I hate to break the news,
but that's the way it's done.

105
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,711
You better stop pushing me around.
It could be dangerous. It could.

106
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,874
Benjie, if you just look at the pictures,
it does look dumb.

107
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,282
But if two people are in love,
it's supposed to be very pleasant.

108
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:39,753
How do you know? You've never done it!

109
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:43,751
Well, it's right here in the book.
In black and white and color.

110
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:47,387
That's why people kiss first.
It gives them a chance to know each other.

111
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,955
Once they get to know each other,
they fall in love, then they make love.

112
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,501
Foreplay! It's called foreplay.

113
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,605
Everyone takes off their clothes
and they play foreplay.

114
00:10:56,672 --> 00:11:00,438
Then he does this and she does this,
and he does this.

115
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,468
And before you know it, they're screwing!
Now what could be simpler than that?

116
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,684
Now, listen, before I saw these pictures,
I didn't think it was possible either.

117
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,220
But these are pictures, Benjie, pictures!

118
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,779
These aren't drawings.
I've seen those drawings.

119
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,222
These are pictures!

120
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,895
In an emergency, it could mount...

121
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,109
...350 caliber jobs.

122
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,945
Probably handle about...

123
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,271
...a dozen or so depth charges.

124
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,080
It'd sink if it hit a fish.

125
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,753
Stripped down it could do 30 or 40 knots.

126
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,789
Thirty or 40 knots?

127
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,419
Thirty or 40 knots straight down.

128
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:51,551
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:51,004
Two, three, four, five<i>... </i>

130
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:05,356
One, two, three, four, five<i>... </i>

131
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,831
Sixty-nine, seventy.

132
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:53,265
I wish somebody
would invade this dopey island.

133
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,267
I'm going mad!

134
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,577
Hey, Oscy, it's that lady again.

135
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:22,465
Hermie, you're not gonna go into
another deathlike trance again, are you?

136
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,134
I swear, Hermie,
I don't know what's come over you.

137
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,233
That's a very old person over there.

138
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,769
I don't see the attraction.

139
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:36,476
Maybe it's her mind.
Maybe their minds meet and say, '<i>'</i>Hello. '<i>'</i>

140
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,648
Why don't you go
and say hello to her mind, Hermie?

141
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,349
Go on, go say hello.

142
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,515
Cut it out.

143
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:45,750
Come on. If she's the love of your life,
go say hello to her.

144
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,026
Come on, we want to see you go say hello.

145
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,261
Maybe you're some kind of a hotshot lover
we don't know about.

146
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,892
- Cut it out!
- Say hello.

147
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,436
- Knock it off!
- Come on!

148
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:57,605
Come on. Go say hello to her, Hermie.

149
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,800
- Go say hello to her.
- Yeah, go say hello.

150
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,934
Come on, we want to see you go say hello.

151
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,135
Hey, lady in the pink suit!
It's Hermie the rape artist!

152
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,296
It's Jack the Ripper!

153
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:08,667
It's Herman the German, Nazi spy!

154
00:17:09,044 --> 00:17:12,138
- It's a sex fiend!
- It's Hermie the rape artist!

155
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,034
Goddamn!

156
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,202
Oscy, I'll<i>... </i>

157
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,479
Hey, come on, Herm.

158
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,307
Come on.

159
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,010
We were only kidding.

160
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,947
Hermie, it was a joke!

161
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,822
Look out, Oscy! Look out!

162
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,568
Knock it off, Hermie!

163
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,772
Knock it off! Cut it out!

164
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,342
Now I'm gonna let you go, okay?

165
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,184
Okay, now, I'll let you go.

166
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:39,166
Goddamn it, Hermie! You're really crazy!

167
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:41,969
You're really crazy, you know that? Crazy!

168
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,194
Jesus.

169
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:48,643
It's enough, goddamn it! Enough!

170
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,108
Son of a bitch!

171
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,440
Jesus!

172
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,117
Jesus, Oscy, you killed him.

173
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,453
Oh, shit!

174
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,194
Hey, leave him alone, Benjie.

175
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,023
Leave him alone!

176
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,164
The son of a bitch threw sand in my face.

177
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:21,166
- Goddamn it, I mean<i>... </i>
- We'll see you later, Hermie, okay?

178
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,135
Bastards!

179
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:35,422
- Hermie, where're you going?
- The Planet Mongo.

180
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:39,118
- It's not even 8:00!
- I can't do anything about that!

181
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:42,429
- What did you have for breakfast?
- An elephant!

182
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,694
- Bring me back a newspaper.
- Okay.

183
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,426
And a <i>Time</i> magazine for your father!

184
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:49,897
Jesus!

185
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:16,948
May I offer some assistance?

186
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,653
Oh, yes, you may.

187
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,427
I really didn't expect to buy so much.
I should have brought my wagon.

188
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,398
- Yeah, you should've brought your wagon.
- Yes.

189
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:37,635
- What you really need is a wagon.
- I think you're right. I can take one.

190
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,937
No, it's okay. It's okay.

191
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:42,980
If you take some and I take some,
I think we can manage.

192
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:46,578
- I'll be happy to pay you.
- No, I wouldn't think of it. Really.

193
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,646
My house is a pretty long walk.

194
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,949
- I know where it is.
- You do?

195
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,685
Yeah. It's that way.

196
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,364
- Are you sure it's okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

197
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,636
- Well, won't you let me take one?
- No, no.

198
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,167
- Do you live on the island?
- In the summer.

199
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,536
- With your family?
- Yeah.

200
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,047
But they don't bother me.

201
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:15,008
I pretty much go my own way.

202
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,531
Aren't they pretty?

203
00:22:30,832 --> 00:22:33,027
- Oh, yeah.
- I couldn't resist.

204
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,679
I got a 12-page letter today!

205
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:50,041
- That's nice.
- It sure is.

206
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,475
Hey, Hermie!

207
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:25,175
Somebody called you.

208
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,081
Not me.

209
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,789
Is your name Hermie?

210
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:30,718
Yeah.

211
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,056
Well, somebody back there called you.

212
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:34,960
No, not me.

213
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,257
Well, he called Hermie.

214
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,461
Well, Hermie is a pretty common name.

215
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,781
This is it.

216
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,884
I can go further.

217
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:06,326
There's really no need.

218
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:07,726
Okay.

219
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,528
- Oh, can you bring them in?
- Sure.

220
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:18,033
Hang on.

221
00:24:21,276 --> 00:24:22,265
Got it.

222
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:26,042
- In there, in the kitchen.
- Okay.

223
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,309
You can put them on the table.

224
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:36,456
- They should make these bags stronger.
- I think you're right.

225
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,956
- Please let me give you some money.
- I wouldn't think of it.

226
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:42,921
Well, how can I repay you?

227
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:44,958
It's okay, really.

228
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,370
I'm gonna have some coffee.
Would you like some?

229
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:52,669
Sure.

230
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,469
Great. Sit down.

231
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:07,118
These are marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

232
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,316
Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.

233
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:15,921
You drink coffee, don't you?

234
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:18,657
I consume a couple of cups a day.

235
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,697
- Well, I have milk.
- Oh, no, I take it black.

236
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:29,005
- Are you in high school?
- I'm a sophomore.

237
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:31,468
I thought you were older.

238
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:35,178
Next year I'll be a junior. And so on.

239
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:39,876
Now, don't be in too big a hurry. You can
end up in the Army before you know it.

240
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:41,955
Well, I'm prepared to go.

241
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,021
I'm taking preflight courses in high school,
and I guess I'll get my wings.

242
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:51,224
And maybe I can team up with my brother.
He's a paratrooper.

243
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:55,862
And maybe I can drop him out.

244
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,835
So, your brother is a paratrooper?

245
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,843
But, mostly, I have a sister in high school.

246
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,143
Coffee is ready.

247
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,784
I hope it's all right. It's from this morning.

248
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:16,651
It looks fine.

249
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:24,354
I have a little bit of sugar.
Would you like some?

250
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,792
No, no thanks. I'll take it black.

251
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:41,910
I forgot to tell you.
It's awfully hot. Are you all right?

252
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,484
Let me get you some milk.

253
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:45,883
Do you think I could have
a glass of ice water?

254
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,026
Why don't I put the ice in your coffee.
You like ice coffee?

255
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,219
- Sure. Great.
- I'm sorry.

256
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,497
- Are you all right?
- It's okay.

257
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,264
I'm really sorry.

258
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,066
Do you have many friends on the island?

259
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,202
Two.

260
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,915
But they're immature, you know.

261
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:17,985
What do you do to keep yourself busy?

262
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,344
Well, I lean toward basketball.

263
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,750
But I think there's a lot
to be said for baseball.

264
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,026
At least in baseball you don't get
round-shouldered from dribbling.

265
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,364
No, that's true.

266
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,776
- Do you like music?
- Yeah, I'm quite musical.

267
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,974
Do you play an instrument?

268
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,071
I sing.

269
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,679
Well, I think a voice is like an instrument.

270
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,419
I do, too.

271
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:58,790
And then for a change,
you can always whistle.

272
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,591
I can see that.

273
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,425
- You'll like those.
- They're good.

274
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:10,265
- I think I'll be going.
- Do you have to go?

275
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,573
- Yes, I really think I should.
- Wait.

276
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,767
Here, take the rest of the doughnuts.
Seems the least I can do.

277
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:21,079
- Thank you very much.
- No, I thank you.

278
00:28:21,716 --> 00:28:23,684
You're welcome. It was a privilege.

279
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:26,148
Next time I'll be sure to take my wagon.

280
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,755
I think you should. You could get a hernia.

281
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,685
Goodbye, Hermie. And thanks again.

282
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:34,824
Goodbye. And you're welcome.

283
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,495
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.

284
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,795
It would be a privilege.

285
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:43,431
Goodbye.

286
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:50,269
Hernia! Jesus!

287
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,686
Hermie!

288
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:14,463
Wait a minute.

289
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,036
Hermie, hold on.

290
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:24,943
- Hi.
- You were in there a long time.

291
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:28,742
You could've brought those bags in
and be out in 10 seconds. What happened?

292
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,307
- We had drinks.
- You're kidding? They had drinks.

293
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,286
- Big deal.
- She let you get funny?

294
00:29:33,922 --> 00:29:34,980
You're a dope.

295
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:38,514
Come on, an older woman like that,
what's a little feel to her?

296
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:41,960
- She let you have a feel, Hermie?
- She gave me some doughnuts.

297
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,128
Probably stinks from perfume.

298
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,728
Grow up!

299
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:51,362
Come on, will you tell us
what happened in there all that time?

300
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:53,202
I wasn't aware of the time.

301
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,002
It flew quickly.

302
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,540
Boy, I'm telling you,
I'd like to give her a feel.

303
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,276
I thought you were mature, Oscy.

304
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:04,341
It's very mature to feel girls.
My brother does it all the time.

305
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,943
How come he's a dentist?

306
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,818
Don't get to be such a big shot
all of the sudden.

307
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,381
Don't try to tell us
something went on in there.

308
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:13,458
I ain't trying to tell you anything.

309
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,588
Which is exactly the same as telling us
a lot went on in there. A lot!

310
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:18,924
Screw you!

311
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,167
I ain't gonna tell you
that something happened if it didn't.

312
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,329
Nothing happened!

313
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:27,234
If you believe something happened,
then I'm sorry, because nothing happened.

314
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,304
- Jesus! I don't even know her name!
- You expect us to believe that?

315
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:34,343
I don't care what you believe!
I'm going home.

316
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:38,141
My father is waiting for his newspaper
and his <i>Time</i> magazine.

317
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,452
Going home?

318
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,380
Yeah, I'm going home!

319
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,754
A few things to think over. Going home.

320
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:50,854
- Well, what are you gonna do later?
- Gonna kill myself!

321
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,593
- No, after that?
- I don't know, Oscy, I don't know!

322
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,797
Hernia! Jesus!

323
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,257
Good evening.

324
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,802
Fine night for an evening of movies.

325
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,329
Are you old enough to be up this late?

326
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,398
I have two charming friends.

327
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,400
You have ice cream on your face.

328
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:13,073
That perfume! I grow dizzy.

329
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:18,274
My friends and I would like
you three ladies to join us in the movies.

330
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,918
Dutch treat, I suppose.

331
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,155
Yeah. But, we'll spring for refreshments.

332
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:30,030
- Where are they?
- It's those two rascals over there.

333
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,995
- Where?
- Over there.

334
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,601
Smile. Look older.

335
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,133
Here, come on.

336
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,302
They're coming this way.

337
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:44,808
- What's your name?
- Oscy.

338
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,904
- Don't panic.
- I'm sweating.

339
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:49,073
Don't sweat!

340
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:54,746
This is Hermie and this is Benjie.
And this is Miriam.

341
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,649
This is Aggie and this is Gloria.

342
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:02,462
Let's see. Hermie, you're with Aggie
because you're both intellectual.

343
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,955
Benjie, you're with Gloria, because.

344
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,466
I have to go home.

345
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:10,397
- If Gloria doesn't go, we don't go.
- Benjie!

346
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:12,837
- It's not important that I go.
- Don't be silly!

347
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,307
I'm not being silly, I don't want to go.

348
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,606
- Well, then we won't go.
- Go without her.

349
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:20,442
- She's our friend. We stick together.
- Go without me.

350
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,315
- She wants you to go without her.
- She doesn't.

351
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,045
- She does!
- She does not!

352
00:33:25,153 --> 00:33:27,348
She left. Now, come on, let's get in line.

353
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,357
The night is still young.
I don't want to miss the cartoon.

354
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:32,986
- Hello.
- Hi.

355
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,266
Then we each want a 15-cent candy.

356
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,664
Sure, okay.

357
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:55,543
Fifteen cents.

358
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:01,578
That's the last time
I ever do anything for Benjie.

359
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:03,887
He's too young. It's beyond him.

360
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,483
Christ, he almost screwed up
the whole arrangement.

361
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,462
- I got bad news.
- What?

362
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,292
You have to lend me a dime.

363
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:16,100
Here's a nickel.
Hold on, I got some pennies.

364
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,069
Catch the boobs on Miriam.

365
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,404
You catch them.

366
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,912
She throws them, I'll catch them.
I'll be ready.

367
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:29,411
Those boobs come at me,
I'll be there to catch them.

368
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:32,184
Hermie. Hi.

369
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,385
Hi, there.

370
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:35,547
- Going to the movies?
- Yeah.

371
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,088
That's nice. Good to see you.

372
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:45,357
- She really knows you.
- Jesus, it's embarrassing.

373
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,798
- What?
- Her, seeing me with that.

374
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:49,268
Hermie, excuse me.

375
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,238
Do you think you could come by my house
Thursday afternoon?

376
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:55,207
I have some heavy things to move
and I'll need some help.

377
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,005
- Sure! Okay.
- Great.

378
00:34:57,445 --> 00:35:01,381
Maybe Thursday morning would be better.
About 10:00? Is that all right?

379
00:35:01,983 --> 00:35:05,817
- Sure. We'll have coffee.
- Yes. You like it black, right?

380
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:09,548
- Yeah, right.
- See you Thursday. Enjoy the picture.

381
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,054
- Hey, you're in.
- Shut up!

382
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,357
You're in, boy. I can't believe it.

383
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:20,559
She's mad about you.
Coffee at 10:00. Shit.

384
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:21,795
Will you shut up?

385
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,169
I'm all excited. I'm gonna squeeze the crap
out of Miriam, soon as the lights go out.

386
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,841
You're really something.
You can't even wait till the cartoon is over.

387
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:31,902
I can't wait. I can't wait!

388
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:40,678
<i>Silly name, isn't it?</i>

389
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:43,519
<i>My father named me</i>
<i>after a professor he was fond of. </i>

390
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:47,027
<i>I was J.D. in college</i>
<i>and my wife calls me J. Duveaux. </i>

391
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:49,527
<i>But I'm Jerry to my friends. </i>

392
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:52,625
<i>And now, won't you tell me who you are?</i>

393
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:56,465
<i>My name is Vale. V-a-I-e. </i>

394
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:01,101
<i>If it ever appears on the passenger list,</i>
<i>it will be C. Vale. </i>

395
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:02,608
Stop it!

396
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:06,913
- <i>Are you one of the Vales of Boston?</i>
- <i>One of the lesser ones. </i>

397
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:08,511
<i>Well, which one?</i>

398
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,149
<i>I don't even know yet</i>
<i>whether it's Miss or Mrs. </i>

399
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,947
<i>It's Aunt. </i>

400
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:15,617
<i>Every family has one, you know. </i>

401
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:16,983
<i>But Aunt what?</i>

402
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:20,255
<i>My name is Charlotte Vale. </i>

403
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:23,056
<i>Miss Charlotte Vale. </i>

404
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,490
<i>It was like a miracle happening. </i>

405
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,692
<i>Like having your child. </i>

406
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,470
- Stop it!
- All right.

407
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,966
<i>I even allowed myself</i>
<i>to indulge in the fantasy... </i>

408
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:38,705
<i>... that both of us loving her,</i>
<i>and doing what was best for her together... </i>

409
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,109
<i>... would make her seem actually</i>
<i>like our child after awhile. </i>

410
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,884
<i>But I see no such fantasy</i>
<i>has occurred to you. </i>

411
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:49,980
<i>Again, I've been a big sentimentaI fooI.</i>
<i>It's a tendency I have. </i>

412
00:36:51,826 --> 00:36:53,088
<i>Wait a minute. </i>

413
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:56,696
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>you were keeping Tina out of pity. </i>

414
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:00,229
<i>But there was no note of pity</i>
<i>in your ridicule of me just now. </i>

415
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:04,069
<i>I know you still love me,</i>
<i>and it won't die, what's between us. </i>

416
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:08,731
<i>Do what you will:</i>
<i>ignore it, neglect it, starve it. </i>

417
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,372
Stop it!

418
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:12,537
<i>It's stronger than both of us together. </i>

419
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:14,841
<i>Please, let me go. </i>

420
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:16,808
<i>Charlotte. </i>

421
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:21,915
<i>Please, let me go. </i>

422
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,660
<i>Jerry?</i>

423
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,604
<i>Dr. Jaquith knows about us. </i>

424
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:44,700
<i>When he said I could take Tina,</i>
<i>he said, "You're on probation. "</i>

425
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,504
<i>Do you know what that means?</i>

426
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,785
<i>It means that I am on probation</i>
<i>because of you and me. </i>

427
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,680
<i>He allowed this visit as a test. </i>

428
00:37:56,624 --> 00:37:58,558
<i>If I can't stand such tests... </i>

429
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,217
<i>... I'll lose Tina. </i>

430
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,125
<i>Then we'll lose each other. </i>

431
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:07,825
<i>Jerry, please help me. </i>

432
00:38:12,173 --> 00:38:14,266
<i>Shall we just have a cigarette on it?</i>

433
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,268
<i>Yes. </i>

434
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,245
<i>May I sometimes come here?</i>

435
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,845
<i>Whenever you like. It's your home, too. </i>

436
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,021
<i>There are people here who love you. </i>

437
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:07,627
<i>To look at you and Tina,</i>
<i>see everything peace and contentment. </i>

438
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:11,559
<i>Of course. And just think,</i>
<i>it won't be for this time only. </i>

439
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,861
<i>That is if you will help me</i>
<i>keep what we have. </i>

440
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,369
<i>We'll both try hard to protect</i>
<i>that little strip of territory that's ours. </i>

441
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,038
<i>We can talk about your child. </i>

442
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,438
<i>Our child. </i>

443
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:30,347
<i>Thank you. </i>

444
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,750
<i>And will you be happy, Charlotte?</i>

445
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,486
<i>Jerry, don't let ask for the moon. </i>

446
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:38,919
<i>We have the stars. </i>

447
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:07,353
Where do you live?

448
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:09,253
That's off the point.

449
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:15,217
- Let's go to the beach and watch the surf.
- No, it's late. We really have to go.

450
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,353
Come on.

451
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:19,990
No! But maybe we'll see you
on the beach tomorrow.

452
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:23,366
- Will you be on the beach tomorrow?
- Ain't gonna be on a mountain.

453
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:24,961
Well, then we'll see you.

454
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,534
'Bye.

455
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:31,468
Yeah, 'bye.

456
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:37,105
Come on.

457
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:48,920
- How did you make out?
- Pretty good.

458
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,788
- What did you do?
- I held her breast.

459
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,827
- You didn't?
- For almost 11 minutes.

460
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:56,835
Fantastic!

461
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:59,962
- Eleven full minutes.
- You timed it!

462
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:06,271
The longest I ever got
was eight minutes with Lila Harrison.

463
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:08,606
- So, you broke your record!
- By three minutes.

464
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:12,719
What did it feel like?

465
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:15,888
What'd you mean, what'd it feel like?
It felt like a breast.

466
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,080
Didn't it feel like an arm?

467
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,988
An arm?

468
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:24,158
- No, it felt like a breast.
- Come on, I bet it felt like an arm.

469
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,263
- Why the hell should it feel like an arm?
- Because it was an arm.

470
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,729
Now, what's the matter with you, Oscy?

471
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:36,739
You were feeling her arm. I was looking.
That's what I was trying to tell you.

472
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,607
You were squeezing an arm
for 11 minutes, you schmuck.

473
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:43,380
So the eight minute record
with Lila Harrison still stands.

474
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:47,645
- God damn it, Oscy, you're lying!
- I wouldn't lie about an arm, Hermie.

475
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:51,688
An arm?

476
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,155
Jesus, I was passing out
and it was an arm.

477
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,928
A very lovely arm.

478
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:02,636
- Well, you're a son of a bitch!
- What?

479
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,933
- Son of a bitch! Why did you tell me?
- What?

480
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:08,964
- Why not just let me think it was a breast?
- I thought you should know the truth.

481
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,303
I thought you should know
so you won't make that mistake again.

482
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:15,177
You wanted to ruin my memory of it,
you son of a bitch!

483
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,045
The hell!

484
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,381
What do I care if you spend
your whole life squeezing arms?

485
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,614
I just thought you ought to face reality.

486
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:25,121
Especially if you're putting a clock on it
and going for records.

487
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,193
I guess you're right.

488
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:34,261
God, how can I ever face her again?

489
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:39,839
Make sure she's wearing long sleeves.

490
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,675
An arm.

491
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:45,805
An 11-minute arm!

492
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:52,113
Lila Harrison, your record is safe!

493
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:54,412
Lila Harrison. Jesus!

494
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,661
Nothing is too heavy
when love is in the air.

495
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,629
Laughter becomes you.

496
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,002
Coffee is exquisite. Exquisite.

497
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,682
- Is that you, Hermie?
- It is I.

498
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,961
Come on in. The door is open.

499
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:43,295
I'll be out in a minute.
Why don't you sit down?

500
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:45,836
I certainly will.

501
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:47,662
Shall.

502
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:50,367
Well<i>... </i>

503
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:16,865
Hi.

504
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:30,476
We'll have the coffee later, all right?

505
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:34,376
Okay.

506
00:44:35,189 --> 00:44:37,350
- Your coffee is exquisite.
- Thank you.

507
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:42,092
I hope it wasn't an inconvenience
for you to come by like this.

508
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:43,424
No, it's okay.

509
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:55,136
- What's up there?
- Dust.

510
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:58,772
- May I see?
- Sure.

511
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,994
There's lots of room.
We shouldn't have any trouble.

512
00:45:21,935 --> 00:45:24,836
Thank you. You're right.
There's lots of dust up there.

513
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,236
Laughter becomes you.

514
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:33,445
The best thing for me to do is hand you
the boxes one at a time, don't you think?

515
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,440
Yeah, okay.

516
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:57,230
How are you doing?

517
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,002
Fine.

518
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,876
Hermie, what's wrong? Are you all right?

519
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:11,280
Yeah.

520
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,677
Well, your leg is shaking.

521
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:20,084
I don't think your ladder is too good.

522
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:24,458
Do you want me to hold it?

523
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,234
I think you better hand me another box.

524
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,636
Just two more.

525
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:53,749
That's it. Come on down.

526
00:47:06,873 --> 00:47:07,897
Good job.

527
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:18,108
Look, this time you really must let me
give you some money.

528
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,085
- No, I couldn't take any money.
- But you have to!

529
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:24,180
I couldn't possibly have gotten
those boxes up there myself.

530
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:25,650
It's okay.

531
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,053
I like you.

532
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,297
That's very sweet of you, Hermie.
I like you, too.

533
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:39,729
I mean, I don't like many people.

534
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,886
Hermie! Hey, Hermie!

535
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,695
Come on!

536
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,691
Come on, will you, hurry up?

537
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,337
Get up here, come on. What happened?

538
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,502
- Nothing.
- What went on in there all that time?

539
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,599
Nothing.

540
00:48:16,943 --> 00:48:19,377
Come on, try to remember.
What happened?

541
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,316
Well, the way it went,
we went in and we chatted.

542
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,211
Yeah?

543
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,842
And than I put the boxes in the attic.

544
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,352
- And then she kissed me.
- Kissed you?

545
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:31,747
Yeah, right here. See any lipstick?

546
00:48:32,392 --> 00:48:34,257
Jesus! He's right. Lipstick!

547
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:38,191
- That's blood. It's a mosquito bite.
- No, it's lipstick.

548
00:48:39,566 --> 00:48:43,093
- That's definitely lipstick!
- Look, Oscy, I like her kissing me, not you.

549
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,302
It's blood. She's a goddamn vampire!

550
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:51,007
As I left, I'm sure she asked me
to come back. Any time.

551
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:54,012
You know, Hermie,
I really think you've struck gold.

552
00:48:54,114 --> 00:48:55,138
I really do.

553
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:03,684
- Benjie! We're gonna need the book again.
- You can just whistle.

554
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:07,249
You drooled all over it. I don't want
to get blamed for any warped pages.

555
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,794
My glasses for the book.

556
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:12,491
You'll have loads of fun
identifying enemy aircraft over the island.

557
00:49:12,566 --> 00:49:16,058
- You'll be a hero!
- Nothing flies over this island except birds!

558
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:19,264
- Maybe they're enemies.
- Jesus Christ, no go!

559
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:20,634
It's a fair swap.

560
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,198
What's more,
you can have the glasses for two days.

561
00:49:23,276 --> 00:49:25,437
I only need the book for one afternoon.

562
00:49:25,512 --> 00:49:28,003
If you don't like my offer,
I'll break your nose.

563
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:30,811
- Come on, Oscy.
- Come on, Hermie! Christ!

564
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,552
In the name of the USA,
I award you these field glasses.

565
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:36,183
Good hunting.

566
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,094
Benjie, come on, hurry up.

567
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,329
Hurry up, Benjie. Come on.

568
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,800
Come on, hurry up.

569
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,383
Come on.

570
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,114
<i>Now,</i> Backstage Wife.

571
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,620
<i>The beloved story of Mary Noble. </i>
<i>Now Mary Noble, war wife. </i>

572
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:53,191
<i>Her husband Larry, former Broadway star,</i>
<i>now Lieutenant Noble of the Coast Guard... </i>

573
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:54,198
Come on.

574
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:56,235
<i>... somewhere in the South Pacific. </i>

575
00:50:56,937 --> 00:51:00,634
<i>If you recall, when we last heard</i>
<i>from Larry, he and a lone companion... </i>

576
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:04,234
<i>... Bosun's Mate Smith, were stranded</i>
<i>on an enemy infested island... </i>

577
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,075
<i>... after their rubber boat</i>
<i>had been wrecked in a squall. </i>

578
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,018
Come on.

579
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,855
- <i>Mrs. Larson didn't. </i>
- <i>She didn't, but now she does. </i>

580
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:24,791
<i>Yes, now she does use Duz. </i>

581
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:29,063
<i>Now Mrs. Larson knows Duz. </i>
<i>D-u-z does everything in her wash. </i>

582
00:51:29,536 --> 00:51:31,834
<i>She's convinced</i>
<i>this new kind of soap is best. </i>

583
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:35,773
<i>Why, it's even improved her disposition. </i>
<i>She used to be a crosspatch on washday. </i>

584
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,072
- Watch that step.
- Okay, okay.

585
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:41,303
<i>She's twice as sunny. </i>

586
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:44,214
<i>You wouldn't dirty up so many towels</i>
<i>if you had to wash them. </i>

587
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:47,815
<i>I know your rayon undies</i>
<i>don't look bright anymore... </i>

588
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:49,014
Come on.

589
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:52,650
<i>Ah, but then Mrs. Larson</i>
<i>started using Duz instead of... </i>

590
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,220
Hermie, I just cleaned in there.

591
00:51:57,397 --> 00:51:58,796
Goddamn it!

592
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,696
- Where's the paper?
- It's in the drawer.

593
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:13,473
I found it. Where's the carbon paper?

594
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,702
In there!

595
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,250
What are you doing?

596
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,186
Making two copies.
One for me and one for you.

597
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:30,957
You can keep it with you at all times,
and refer to it and learn it.

598
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,061
What for?

599
00:52:32,332 --> 00:52:35,096
You can't call on your lady
with a book under your arm...

600
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:37,466
...so I'm condensing it. Point by point.

601
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:39,835
Stay close to this and you'll do okay.

602
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,938
You know, Oscy, I'm troubled.
I think I have a deep feeling for her.

603
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:45,199
So what?

604
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,670
Well, so I don't want to just lay her.

605
00:52:48,214 --> 00:52:49,340
I respect her.

606
00:52:49,616 --> 00:52:53,552
There's something you have to understand.
It's all right to respect a lady.

607
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,589
But, she's won't respect you
if you don't try to lay her.

608
00:52:56,656 --> 00:52:57,953
I don't believe that.

609
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:01,289
It's true! My brother told me.
That's the way ladies are.

610
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:04,129
They want you to try,
even if they don't let you.

611
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,097
Because even though they don't let you,
they want you to.

612
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:10,431
- I think I understand.
- Good. Now you start memorizing.

613
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,104
- This is crazy.
- What?

614
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:23,304
Point three.

615
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,216
What's crazy about it?

616
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:29,752
- I've never even heard of the word.
- It's Latin. The original guys were Latins.

617
00:53:30,423 --> 00:53:34,382
- I wouldn't even know how to pronounce it.
- You don't pronounce it, you just do it!

618
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:36,461
I don't even know where it is!

619
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:40,927
And what the hell is this in number four?

620
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:44,403
That's Latin, too.
It's all in Latin, Hermie. Jesus!

621
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:47,667
Yeah? I may just have to ask her
where some of these things are!

622
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,967
They're all in approximately
the same place. '<i>'</i>Seek and ye shall find. '<i>'</i>

623
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:55,073
Besides, she's supposed to be
helping you out.

624
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:59,079
Well, I hope so because I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

625
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,286
Point six, Hermie, very important.

626
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:07,549
- Foreplay.
- Right! That word keeps cropping up.

627
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,259
I still don't know what I'm supposed to do.

628
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,561
What do I say?
'<i>'</i>How about a little foreplay?'<i>'</i>

629
00:54:13,633 --> 00:54:15,794
I told you. You don't have to say a word.

630
00:54:15,935 --> 00:54:19,098
Yeah? Point two definitely states
that we're supposed to converse.

631
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,073
Swell, but when you get to Point six,
there's no more talking.

632
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:23,837
Just moaning and sighing.

633
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,768
Just moan and sigh.

634
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:29,646
- Well, she'll think I'm sick.
- No, she'll be moaning and sighing, too.

635
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,045
It's gonna get pretty noisy. Boy.

636
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:36,783
I got news on Miriam today.
One of the lifeguards told me.

637
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,882
Once she gets started,
she's supposed to really be something.

638
00:54:39,959 --> 00:54:41,449
I'm home, Hermie, home!

639
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,187
Look, Oscy, if I follow these 12 points,
she just might have a kid.

640
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:49,994
I can't afford a kid at this stage of my life.
So the whole thing is off!

641
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:53,105
I really can't believe it, Hermie.
You are really dumb.

642
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:55,707
I may be dumb,
but I'm not gonna be a father!

643
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:58,767
- Two wrongs don't make a right.
- You use protection.

644
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,546
You use a rubber.
Haven't you ever heard of a rubber?

645
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:05,778
- Yeah, of course I have.
- All right, so that's what you use!

646
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,684
I already have mine.

647
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,025
When my brother went into the service,
he willed it to me.

648
00:55:13,593 --> 00:55:15,686
I've been carrying it around ever since.

649
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:17,553
It's my lucky charm.

650
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,395
- How much do you want for it?
- It's from my brother.

651
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,696
It's a family heirloom.

652
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:27,304
You have to get your own.
Go to the drugstore.

653
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,805
I'm not gonna risk it.
I happen to be underage.

654
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:34,311
Also, for information, Oscy,
women shop in drugstores.

655
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,281
So where do you want to get them?
A sporting goods store?

656
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,719
If you were a really good friend,
you'd lend me yours.

657
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,754
- What?
- Well, I'll return it.

658
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:46,454
Hermie, I'm beginning to think
that maybe you're a homo.

659
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:50,186
- Swell, Oscy, thanks a lot.
- No, I mean, you don't know anything.

660
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:54,258
A rubber's to be used once, and only once.
And only by one party.

661
00:55:54,801 --> 00:55:57,793
Not even the best of friends
can go half-sies on a rubber.

662
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:02,337
- Just forget the whole damn thing.
- I'm doing this for you, Hermie.

663
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:06,335
I'm doing this out of friendship,
because your time has come.

664
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,913
Yeah? Let's forget it!

665
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,417
I can't. It's all arranged.

666
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:15,286
- What's arranged?
- Marshmallow roast, on the beach tonight.

667
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:19,714
Me and Miriam and you and Aggie.
Don't try to get out of it, it's all set.

668
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:23,192
- Here are your instructions.
- I'm not interested in Aggie!

669
00:56:23,863 --> 00:56:27,629
You're not ready for the older lady.
I have to sharpen you up on someone else.

670
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,324
Aggie is all I got.

671
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:33,194
- You know, Oscy, you're really crazy!
- Yeah. Crazy, man!

672
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,604
Sorry. Listen.

673
00:56:36,242 --> 00:56:40,201
I'm not asking you to get to Point 12
because I don't believe in miracles!

674
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:42,843
I'll be happy if you get to Point two.

675
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,942
- Now, all I want you to do is give it a try.
- Forget it.

676
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:48,783
I'm not sticking my neck out for Aggie.
Jesus, Aggie!

677
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,846
Tomorrow morning, you'll thank me.

678
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:54,485
So, tonight, I'll bring the marshmallows
and you bring a rubber.

679
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:19,510
- Go on.
- All right.

680
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:24,522
Well, go on. Come on. Get in there.

681
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:44,701
- Anything else?
- Yes, a large bottle of cod liver oil.

682
00:57:44,777 --> 00:57:47,143
- Ma!
- Shut up, it's good for you.

683
00:57:48,781 --> 00:57:51,579
It's $2.18. Thank you. Come again.

684
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:56,517
- Move.
- All right, all right.

685
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:58,352
Move, move already.

686
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,452
Can I help you?

687
00:58:35,862 --> 00:58:37,659
No. Just looking.

688
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,257
Did you get them?

689
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,031
- Not yet.
- Well, go get them.

690
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:18,331
There's a lady in there.

691
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:54,170
Okay. Get going. Go on.

692
00:59:54,941 --> 00:59:56,272
- All right.
- Go!

693
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:18,895
Yes?

694
01:00:19,732 --> 01:00:21,996
It's me. The same guy as before.

695
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,428
I just stepped outside for some air.

696
01:00:29,242 --> 01:00:32,075
Just what is it you're looking for?
Maybe I can help you.

697
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,246
I'll know when I find it.

698
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:47,491
Maybe if you'd tell me what it is?

699
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:52,487
I'll tell you. I just remembered.

700
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,629
Well?

701
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,235
A strawberry ice cream cone.

702
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:05,004
All right, come with me.

703
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,344
One dip or two?

704
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,587
Better make it a triple.

705
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,862
All right. That'll be 10 cents.

706
01:01:32,572 --> 01:01:35,473
There's something else I need.
I just remembered.

707
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:38,208
Well, what is it?

708
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,411
Sprinkles.

709
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,948
All right.

710
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:53,756
Sprinkles. Here you go.

711
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:55,961
Thanks a lot.

712
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:58,758
That'll cost you 12 cents.

713
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,297
Is there something else?

714
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:09,072
Well, I hate to bother you, but<i>... </i>

715
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,202
Speak up, son.

716
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:17,916
How about a napkin?

717
01:02:19,252 --> 01:02:20,310
All right.

718
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:26,058
- Anything else?
- How about some rubbers?

719
01:02:31,264 --> 01:02:32,253
Pardon?

720
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:35,400
I understand that you carry them.

721
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,833
Carry what?

722
01:02:38,437 --> 01:02:40,064
Come on, you know what.

723
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,537
Contraceptives?

724
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,801
Yeah. Right.

725
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:47,207
And you want to buy some?

726
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:49,139
Yeah.

727
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,117
What for?

728
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,816
Come on. You know what for.

729
01:02:58,724 --> 01:02:59,782
All right.

730
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,264
What brand?

731
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:16,104
- Brand?
- Brand and style.

732
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,805
- The usual.
- Well, there's a number to choose from.

733
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:28,416
Do you have to flash them around?

734
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,314
Which is your usual?

735
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,430
- The blue ones.
- And how many would you like?

736
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,561
Three dozen.

737
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:46,260
You planning a big night?

738
01:03:47,106 --> 01:03:48,403
Just the usual.

739
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:52,504
That'll be $12.

740
01:03:53,446 --> 01:03:56,313
- $12?
- And 12 cents for the ice cream.

741
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:00,048
Well, how much just for a dozen?

742
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,153
$4.

743
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:05,348
And how many for $1? Three.

744
01:04:07,627 --> 01:04:10,721
- I'll take two.
- They come three to a package.

745
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,234
Can I just owe you
for the ice cream cone, then?

746
01:04:17,637 --> 01:04:20,663
All right now, son. Fun is fun.

747
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,531
- But how old are you?
- Sixteen.

748
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:25,876
How old?

749
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:27,979
On my next birthday.

750
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,875
What are you planning to do with these?

751
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:35,585
Well, they're for my brother. He's older.

752
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:38,687
Why can't he come in
and get them for himself?.

753
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,452
Well, he's sick.

754
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,219
Well, then what does he need them for?

755
01:04:43,896 --> 01:04:45,796
For when he's feeling better.

756
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,762
He's a Ranger.

757
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:52,527
Do you know what these are used for?

758
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:58,642
Sure. You fill them up with water,
and then you throw them off the roof.

759
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:02,037
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you knew what they were for.

760
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:04,042
Of course I know.

761
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:07,574
My brother wouldn't send me in
to buy them without telling me.

762
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,787
We'll call it $1 even,
including the ice cream.

763
01:05:11,557 --> 01:05:12,546
Okay.

764
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,523
Thank you!

765
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,531
- Hi, Hermie.
- Hi, Aggie.

766
01:05:25,638 --> 01:05:27,503
I had a very nice time at the movie.

767
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,237
- I'm sorry if I was rough on your arm.
- That's all right.

768
01:05:31,544 --> 01:05:32,943
Is it healing well?

769
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,879
It's okay, really.
I'm looking forward to tonight.

770
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:39,884
Oscy is outside.
He's bringing the marshmallows.

771
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:42,079
Yeah, I saw him. What are you bringing?

772
01:05:43,823 --> 01:05:45,882
I'll see you later Aggie, okay?

773
01:05:46,726 --> 01:05:48,990
- Tonight. 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

774
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,941
Can I toast you
another tasty marshmallow?

775
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:09,745
If you like, but...

776
01:06:10,516 --> 01:06:13,041
...shouldn't we save a few
for Oscy and Miriam?

777
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:17,082
We may never see them again.

778
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,854
They seem to be getting along very well.

779
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,525
Yes, they're very friendly.

780
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:29,266
Hermie.

781
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:34,863
- Excuse me for a moment, please.
- Sure.

782
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,098
Thank you.

783
01:06:38,677 --> 01:06:41,669
Hi. Let me see your notes.
Mine are all sweaty and crumpled.

784
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,572
Hey, come on. Come on, fork over.

785
01:06:45,217 --> 01:06:47,242
- What number you up to?
- Six.

786
01:06:47,386 --> 01:06:50,583
Six? Six is foreplay! You up to six?

787
01:06:50,689 --> 01:06:53,317
Yeah, but that crazy Miriam.
She's up to nine!

788
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:55,760
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

789
01:06:55,828 --> 01:06:57,352
She's ruining my timing!

790
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:01,624
Jesus Christ!

791
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,236
How you doing with Aggie?

792
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:08,802
- We're up to the marshmallows.
- No time for gabbing, I got to go.

793
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:22,018
- That was Oscy.
- Yes.

794
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:28,983
- Feel like another marshmallow?
- What's that paper?

795
01:07:31,096 --> 01:07:32,085
This?

796
01:07:33,098 --> 01:07:34,656
It's a map.

797
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:38,359
- A buried treasure?
- Yeah. I think so.

798
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,665
Can I see it?

799
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,504
Why don't you just have
another marshmallow?

800
01:07:45,244 --> 01:07:46,268
All right.

801
01:07:55,788 --> 01:07:56,652
Hermie.

802
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:00,347
Hermie!

803
01:08:01,126 --> 01:08:03,458
- Would you excuse me again?
- Yes.

804
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:04,894
You're very kind.

805
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:08,991
- What?
- Give me a rubber!

806
01:08:09,568 --> 01:08:13,231
- What happened to your heirloom?
- It was spoiled. I guess they don't keep.

807
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,501
Come on, for Pete's sake!

808
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:19,543
Come on, it's cold.

809
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,388
Don't you even say thank you?

810
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:33,482
Thank you, Hermie.

811
01:08:42,301 --> 01:08:44,098
Why did Miriam say, '<i>'</i>Thank you'<i>'</i>?

812
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:47,931
- Because she's a lady.
- Oh, I see.

813
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,533
- See what?
- Pardon?

814
01:08:52,278 --> 01:08:55,247
- You said you saw. What did you see?
- Actually nothing.

815
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,078
- Then don't say you see when you don't.
- Okay.

816
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,905
Need a rubber?

817
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:33,450
I need a breather.

818
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,844
I also need another rubber.

819
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,683
Did you get to Point 12 yet?

820
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,889
Twelve? We're so far past 12<i>... </i>

821
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:48,766
But, that's as far as the book goes.
What's after 12?

822
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:55,570
There's 13 and 14.

823
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,905
Fifteen. Hermie, you have no idea.

824
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,212
And 16, 17 and 18.

825
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,028
I think Miriam and I
should be getting home now.

826
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:21,127
- I'll take you home, come on.
- I think I'd better get Miriam.

827
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:23,695
Hey, Aggie!

828
01:10:24,003 --> 01:10:26,972
No, I don't think so!
Aggie, I'll take you home.

829
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,402
Hi.

830
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,606
Hermie, hi.

831
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:14,070
- How have you been?
- Fine, thank you. And you?

832
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,713
- Pretty good.
- Good.

833
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:23,246
What a beautiful morning!

834
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:25,947
Should be a really nice day.

835
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,696
How are the boxes we put away?
Any trouble?

836
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:36,827
No. They're fine. Still up there.

837
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,098
I think they'll be all right.

838
01:12:48,313 --> 01:12:51,043
I'd ask you to the movies,
but it's the same picture.

839
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,716
Like to see it again?

840
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:56,582
No. No thanks.

841
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,855
I don't blame you.

842
01:13:00,926 --> 01:13:03,224
Once you know the ending,
it kills the thrill.

843
01:13:11,937 --> 01:13:13,302
Tide is coming in.

844
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,331
So it is.

845
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:27,883
Have you any other
heavy objects you want moved?

846
01:13:29,354 --> 01:13:31,219
No, none that occur to me.

847
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,619
If you can think of any, feel free.

848
01:13:36,395 --> 01:13:38,625
All right, I will. Thank you.

849
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,538
Will you be at home tonight?

850
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:54,577
Pardon?

851
01:13:55,414 --> 01:13:58,679
Well, I thought I might drop by.
I have to be in the neighborhood.

852
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:04,982
Feel free to drop by.

853
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,427
I'm not saying I can come for sure,
so don't plan on it.

854
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:15,463
It's getting late!

855
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,731
I've got to get to the post office
and get these letters off.

856
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:24,199
- I'll run them down for you.
- No, thanks. It's tricky postage, overseas.

857
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,136
Thanks, anyway.

858
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,542
Hello!

859
01:14:32,684 --> 01:14:34,276
I don't even know your name.

860
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:36,648
Dorothy.

861
01:14:37,256 --> 01:14:39,281
I had a cat named Dorothy.

862
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:41,850
Got hit by a truck.

863
01:14:43,528 --> 01:14:44,324
'Bye.

864
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:40,775
Hi.

865
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:49,517
- You know what?
- What?

866
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:51,356
It's all over.

867
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:54,027
- What?
- Me and Miriam.

868
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,694
- What happened?
- I'm embarrassed to tell you.

869
01:15:57,936 --> 01:16:00,427
- Then don't tell me.
- You won't believe it.

870
01:16:00,706 --> 01:16:04,301
- After last night, I'll believe anything.
- It's not what you think.

871
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:08,146
- Oscy, I'm in kind of a hurry.
- We had an argument this afternoon.

872
01:16:08,213 --> 01:16:11,080
And I went over to her house
to apologize to her.

873
01:16:12,084 --> 01:16:13,711
She's got appendicitis.

874
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:17,780
Took her over to the mainland.
Hope they leave her there.

875
01:16:17,856 --> 01:16:22,793
- I hope they don't cut up her boobs.
- I don't think the scar goes that far.

876
01:16:22,861 --> 01:16:26,763
She told me she was breaking our date.
The next thing I know, appendicitis!

877
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:29,159
Christ, she sure goes to extremes.

878
01:16:29,434 --> 01:16:31,925
They loaded her on the speedboat
on a stretcher.

879
01:16:32,037 --> 01:16:33,766
Maybe it's all for the better.

880
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,137
For the better?
How can you say such a dumb thing?

881
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:39,371
- Because I'm not really interested.
- Bullshit! You're interested.

882
01:16:39,444 --> 01:16:42,072
You took yourself some long look
at us last night.

883
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:45,082
- We knew you were looking.
- I only caught a glimpse.

884
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,714
Will you shut up, Oscy?
I don't want to hear your dirty details.

885
01:16:48,987 --> 01:16:52,252
- You don't want me to tell you?
- I don't want to hear about it.

886
01:16:52,324 --> 01:16:54,554
- I was gonna tell you everything.
- Don't!

887
01:16:54,793 --> 01:16:58,058
When you want to hear about it,
I'm not gonna tell you.

888
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:58,926
Good!

889
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:01,397
Something's wrong with you.
You're not normal.

890
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:02,194
Good!

891
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,201
- Going to her house?
- Screw you.

892
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:06,100
Got your instructions handy?

893
01:17:06,471 --> 01:17:08,666
It's not gonna be that kind of an evening.

894
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,970
You wouldn't understand
because you're so crass.

895
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,772
Crass? What the hell is crass?

896
01:17:12,844 --> 01:17:15,642
- Leave me alone!
- What the hell are you so mad about?

897
01:17:15,814 --> 01:17:17,805
- I don't know.
- Got your rubbers?

898
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,309
You're a regular comedian!

899
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,910
You know what?
I'm sorry I ever tried to help you!

900
01:17:22,988 --> 01:17:24,478
Well, that makes two of us.

901
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:27,286
I gave up my binoculars
to get you educated, goddamn it!

902
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:29,520
- Tough!
- Word's getting out on you, Hermie.

903
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:30,753
You're a homo.

904
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:34,522
If you don't cut it out, Oscy,
you're gonna get a fat lip!

905
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:52,672
Homo!

906
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:51,431
Hello.

907
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:24,976
Hello?

908
01:20:06,818 --> 01:20:08,615
Dorothy, it's Hermie.

909
01:20:09,854 --> 01:20:11,287
Hermie, from the beach.

910
01:21:10,382 --> 01:21:11,508
Hi, Hermie.

911
01:21:13,685 --> 01:21:14,674
Hi.

912
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:24,559
I don't look very nice, do I?

913
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:28,959
I think you do.

914
01:21:29,834 --> 01:21:31,199
I think I don't.

915
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:38,420
I'm sorry.

916
01:34:19,503 --> 01:34:20,970
Good night, Hermie.

917
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:25,601
Good night.

918
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:16,176
Miriam pulled through.

919
01:36:20,558 --> 01:36:22,492
I talked to her mother this morning.

920
01:36:25,829 --> 01:36:27,956
Jesus, they didn't even operate.

921
01:36:28,499 --> 01:36:29,898
They froze her.

922
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:36,934
I'm relieved about it.

923
01:36:37,808 --> 01:36:39,833
She's through for the summer.

924
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:44,006
Won't be back on the island again.

925
01:36:47,284 --> 01:36:48,581
My first lay.

926
01:36:49,653 --> 01:36:51,245
Gone with the wind.

927
01:36:59,163 --> 01:37:01,256
Have you seen Benjie anywhere?

928
01:37:01,532 --> 01:37:03,466
That rat still has my glasses.

929
01:37:12,176 --> 01:37:15,543
You know, you shouldn't feel so bad,
no matter what happened.

930
01:37:19,783 --> 01:37:21,717
And you don't have to tell me.

931
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,451
But if you want to tell me, you can.

932
01:37:31,528 --> 01:37:33,996
But you don't have to unless you want to.

933
01:37:45,576 --> 01:37:50,570
Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass!

934
01:38:03,994 --> 01:38:07,293
I thought maybe we'd attack
the Coast Guard station tonight.

935
01:38:08,065 --> 01:38:09,623
You know, give them a scare.

936
01:41:24,194 --> 01:41:26,890
<i>Dear Hermie, I must go home now. </i>

937
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:32,660
<i>I'm sure you'll understand,</i>
<i>there's much I have to do. </i>

938
01:41:34,538 --> 01:41:37,837
<i>I won't try and explain</i>
<i>what happened last night... </i>

939
01:41:38,108 --> 01:41:40,576
<i>... because I know that, in time... </i>

940
01:41:40,777 --> 01:41:43,337
<i>... you'll find a proper way</i>
<i>in which to remember it. </i>

941
01:41:44,815 --> 01:41:49,445
<i>What I will do is remember you,</i>
<i>and I pray that... </i>

942
01:41:50,053 --> 01:41:52,248
<i>... you be spared all senseless tragedies. </i>

943
01:41:55,092 --> 01:41:58,892
<i>I wish you good things, Hermie,</i>
<i>only good things. </i>

944
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:02,025
<i>Always, Dorothy. </i>

945
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,438
<i>I was never to see her again. </i>

946
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:12,937
<i>Nor was I ever to learn</i>
<i>what became of her. </i>

947
01:42:15,012 --> 01:42:17,947
<i>We were different then, kids were different. </i>

948
01:42:19,983 --> 01:42:22,577
<i>It took us longer to understand</i>
<i>the things we felt. </i>

949
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,285
<i>Life is made up</i>
<i>of small comings and goings... </i>

950
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:32,988
<i>... and for everything we take with us,</i>
<i>there is something that we leave behind. </i>

951
01:42:35,299 --> 01:42:40,202
<i>In the summer of '42, we raided</i>
<i>the Coast Guard station four times. </i>

952
01:42:41,371 --> 01:42:44,306
<i>We saw five movies,</i>
<i>and had nine days of rain. </i>

953
01:42:45,776 --> 01:42:47,676
<i>Benjie broke his watch. </i>

954
01:42:47,878 --> 01:42:49,846
<i>Oscy gave up the harmonica. </i>

955
01:42:50,781 --> 01:42:52,772
<i>And in a very speciaI way... </i>

956
01:42:53,450 --> 01:42:55,714
<i>... I lost Hermie forever. </i>
