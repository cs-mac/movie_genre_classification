1
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:05,491
A Man and A Woman
received...

2
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:15,089
...THE GRAND PRIZE - 20th Anniversary
International Film Festival, Cannes 1966...

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:20,884
...GRAND PRlZE of the
International Catholic Office of Cinema...

4
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:27,727
...and THE GRAND PRlZE of the
Superior Technical Film Commission...

5
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,924
...for Best Cinematography.

6
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:39,808
So the little girl started
to undress.

7
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,685
She got into her granny's bed.

8
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:47,446
The little girl was puzzled,
because her granny was acting funny.

9
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:48,928
Then she said:

10
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:53,450
"Oh, Grandma,
what big eyes you've got! "

11
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:57,642
And the granny said,
"All the better to see you with. "

12
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:01,085
"Oh, Grandma,
what a long nose you've got! "

13
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:04,047
"All the better to smell you with! "

14
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:08,651
Then she said, " Oh, Grandma,
what long teeth you've got! "

15
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,601
"So much the better
to gobble you up with! "

16
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,924
And she gobbled her up!

17
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,930
-Did you like that story?
-No.

18
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:18,726
Why not?

19
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:20,326
It's sad.

20
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:25,328
What story would you like now?

21
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,842
<i>Blue Beard</i>.

22
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,322
<i>Blue Beard</i>?

23
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:33,452
Let's see.
Once upon a time...

24
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:11,248
A Man and A Woman

25
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,492
Antoine!

26
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:51,806
Pull up the top, please.

27
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,001
To the golf course.

28
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,886
No, to the go-carts.

29
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,283
No, the harbor.

30
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:18,525
No, to the golf course.

31
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:23,206
On second thought,
let's go to the go-carts.

32
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,322
You hurt me.

33
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:37,007
Did l? I'm sorry if I did!

34
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:40,367
-When I took your hand off the wheel?
-Yes.

35
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:41,807
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:42,849
-You've lost weight. Why's that?
-I don't know.

37
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:46,085
Don't you eat at school?
Don't you like the food?

38
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,170
Do you want some chocolate?

39
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:58,968
No, I want a cake.

40
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,202
A cake?

41
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,286
I don't know if we'll find
a bakery around here.

42
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,642
What sort of cake do you want?

43
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:14,091
Look what I've done now!
It's funny, isn't it?

44
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,049
These boots are nice.

45
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,450
-You want a pair like these?
-No, I want a cake.

46
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,688
You want a cake.

47
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:52,444
Hurry! Otherwise, I'll miss my train!
See you Sunday, darling.

48
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:55,087
Don't get cold.
Hurry, go inside, quick!

49
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:02,043
Go on! Bye. See you Sunday.

50
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,972
Come on, children!

51
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:35,732
We're in the middle of December,
and you drive with the top down.

52
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:37,406
It's not me. It's Antoine.

53
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:41,288
Blame Antoine!
Come and have supper, darling.

54
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,926
-There you are!
-Can I eat now?

55
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,163
Yes, darling. Come on.

56
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,732
Come on, Antoine.

57
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:52,363
I promise you that if you're good all
week, next Sunday we'll go boating.

58
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,404
No, tomorrow! Tomorrow!

59
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,643
Tomorrow, you work. Next Sunday!

60
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,286
Go and have supper.

61
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,926
There, now.
You spoil him, you know.

62
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:03,606
It's only once a week.

63
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,526
But he doesn't work very hard.
He's lazy.

64
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:08,763
Intelligent, but lazy.

65
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,127
He takes after me.

66
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,170
What are you going to do about it?

67
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,405
Antoine's been in your care
for two years. You've done wonders.

68
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:18,133
I'm certain you'll be able to do
even better.

69
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,003
In two years,
we haven't talked seriously.

70
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:24,127
I cannot talk seriously
to a pretty woman.

71
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:27,728
Be careful.
It's foggy this evening.

72
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,323
-Maybe the roads are icy.
-lce?

73
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,928
There you are!

74
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,366
Do you often miss trains?

75
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:28,248
Yes.

76
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,210
I'm not very punctual.

77
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:34,569
Do you always manage to get a lift?

78
00:09:35,213 --> 00:09:36,202
No.

79
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:37,522
I sleep in Deauville.

80
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,046
She doesn't work too well.

81
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,563
I see. She's intelligent, but lazy.

82
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:50,248
Who told you that?

83
00:09:55,213 --> 00:09:56,532
What's her name?

84
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:58,288
Francoise.
,

85
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,642
Him?

86
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:02,802
Antoine.

87
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,122
Antoine.

88
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,082
That's nice.

89
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,204
Do you go regularly to the school?

90
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:16,128
Well, I come every weekend
when I'm not working.

91
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,322
You?

92
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,405
I come every Saturday.

93
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,684
And Sunday too, sometimes.

94
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,042
May l?

95
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:41,932
Why, sure.

96
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:32,526
You mustn't laugh.

97
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:35,448
These songs made people cry in 1 91 4.

98
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:54,608
Are you married?

99
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,042
You?

100
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:05,731
You don't look married.

101
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,242
What does a married man look like?

102
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:18,446
What does your husband do?

103
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:35,092
Gunfight!

104
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,445
Do you mean he's an actor?

105
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:49,931
Well, not quite.

106
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,849
He's more than an actor.

107
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:10,845
Funny job that, stuntman.

108
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:15,122
How does one meet a stuntman?

109
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:19,128
In a gully?

110
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,127
In Texas?

111
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,008
On a burning plane?

112
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,842
Am I close?

113
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:33,482
No.

114
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:36,162
I give up.

115
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:13,965
Your story is like a soap opera.

116
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:16,922
Except for the stuntman,
it's not original.

117
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:19,444
I don't claim to be original.

118
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,168
You meet someone, marry, have a baby.

119
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:24,165
It happens all the time.

120
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:27,365
What can be original
is the man you love.

121
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,644
Your husband must be original.

122
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,132
For me, he is.

123
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:39,370
He's so fascinating, so exclusive!
A man of great integrity.

124
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:42,611
He's passionate about things...

125
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:45,930
...about people, ideas.
About countries...

126
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,326
He sounds like God.

127
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:50,642
For me, maybe.

128
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:56,568
For instance, I spent a week in Brazil
without ever having been there.

129
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,571
Pierre was in a film there.

130
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,322
When he got back,
he talked about samba for a week.

131
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,690
Samba came into our lives.

132
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,169
Samba came into your life!

133
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:09,442
Yes.

134
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,605
<i>"To sing a samba without sadness...</i>

135
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:48,725
<i>...is like loving a woman</i>
<i>who 's nothing but beautiful. "</i>

136
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:51,407
<i>These are the words of</i>
<i>Vinicius de Moraes.</i>

137
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,764
<i>A poet and a diplomat and</i>
<i>the author of this song.</i>

138
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:58,528
<i>In his own words:</i>
<i>"The blackest white man in Brazil. "</i>

139
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:01,526
<i>I am perhaps the most Brazilian</i>
<i>French man.</i>

140
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,212
<i>I would like to tell you</i>
<i>about my love of samba...</i>

141
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,285
<i>...like a lover who dares not</i>
<i>speak to the one he loves...</i>

142
00:16:08,453 --> 00:16:10,728
<i>...and speaks of her</i>

151
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,162
<i>Tonight, I'd like to drink</i>

152
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:03,370
<i>...to better rave about those I have</i>

153
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:06,889

163
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:38,327
<i>A word that shakes a whole people,</i>
<i>making it sing...</i>

164
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:41,291
<i>...their hands to the sky.</i>
<i>Samba.</i>

165
00:19:10,573 --> 00:19:11,847
Where to, in Paris?

166
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:13,842
Rue Lamarque.

167
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,647
Rue Lamarque? Where's that?

168
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,607
It's in Montmartre.

169
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,126
-Is this it?
-Yes.

170
00:19:29,373 --> 00:19:30,852
I didn't know this street.

171
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,002
No?

172
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:34,768
A painter lived here
during World War l.

173
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:40,246
In 1917, he engaged a Russian servant
whose name was Vladimir Ulyanov.

174
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,651
One year later, he was Lenin.

175
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,812
Thank you very much
for giving me a lift.

176
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:50,565
No, please, I can manage.

177
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,406
Goodbye.

178
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:59,323
By the way,
I'm driving to Deauville next Sunday.

179
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,045
Would you like to come?

180
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,768
I'd love to meet your husband.

181
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:24,333
Cut! Okay, let's do it again.

182
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,209
Pierre! Come here a minute.

183
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,971
Not bad. But next time,
don't take so many risks.

184
00:20:32,853 --> 00:20:34,445
Quiet!

185
00:20:58,093 --> 00:20:59,765
Go!

186
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,048
I'm sorry.

187
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:15,285
The way you talked about him,
I didn't know he was dead.

188
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:22,208
About Sunday, that's most kind,
but I'm not sure I'll be free.

189
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,767
Call me Saturday midday
and I'll tell you.

190
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:27,892
I don't have your number.

191
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:29,886
Montmartre 1 5-40.

192
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,051
-Good night.
-Good night.

193
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,366
Montmartre 1 5-40.

194
00:26:21,653 --> 00:26:25,123
--<i>he'd be holding a press conference</i>
<i>in the near future...</i>

195
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,364
<i>...about the salary increases.</i>

196
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:31,845
<i>And now for the sporting events.</i>
<i>There's motor-racing on the agenda...</i>

197
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:35,050
<i>...with the forthcoming</i>
<i>Monte Carlo Rally.</i>

198
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:38,330
<i>In one week, the 35th Rally will</i>
<i>be on its way.</i>

199
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:40,131
<i>Cars are being tuned...</i>

200
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:45,646
<i>...manufacturers are leaving nothing</i>
<i>to chance in the rugged competition.</i>

201
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:50,967
<i>Among the favorites, the Toivonen team</i>
<i>driving a Cooper and a DS21....</i>

202
00:26:59,773 --> 00:27:01,047
<i>We know that this week...</i>

203
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:05,604
<i>...they've been training to the hilt,</i>
<i>getting the maximum from their cars.</i>

204
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,448
Any good?

205
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:44,802
One seventeen.

206
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,167
Forty-three, four.

207
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,322
Not bad.

208
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,047
How many revs?

209
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,122
Eleven thousand.

210
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:17,562
Forty-three, seven.

211
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:23,242
How many revs now?
1 0,300.

212
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:25,608
We've won with 200 revs.
It's perfect.

213
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:45,602
Operator, put me through
to Montmartre 1 5-40.

214
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:52,483
No, no, could you put me through
in five minutes, please?

215
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:53,922
Thanks.

216
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,686
Hello, Montmartre 1 5-40?

217
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:25,812
This is Jean-Louis Duroc.

218
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:32,809
I gave you a lift from Paris,
from Deauville to Paris, last Sunday.

219
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,806
Yes. How are you?

220
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:45,922
I'm planning on driving to see my son
at school in Deauville tomorrow.

221
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,170
I thought you'd like to drive
down there with me.

222
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:52,288
Whenever you like.

223
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:55,488
Around 9, 9:30, whatever.

224
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,082
What?

225
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:59,609
Nine o'clock. Nine it is, then.

226
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,651
Hello, there.

227
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:45,572
I'm late.

228
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,928
Not at all. Could've been worse.

229
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:13,889
<i>As you might have guessed,</i>
<i>that melody is called "Love. "</i>

230
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,808
<i>Performed by Daniel Walt's orchestra.</i>

231
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:20,682
<i>On this Sunday morning,</i>
<i>we'd better talk about the weather.</i>

232
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:23,089
<i>We're in for a bad spell.</i>

233
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:28,811
<i>I can tell you right away that</i>
<i>the weather forecast is rainy.</i>

234
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:31,808
<i>There'll be rain all over France.</i>

235
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:38,162
<i>And roads are flooded, particularly</i>
<i>in the south and central highlands.</i>

236
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:43,926
<i>As for the Parisians who may be</i>
<i>getting the picnic basket ready...</i>

237
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,084
<i>...for a ride in the country...</i>

238
00:32:46,373 --> 00:32:50,491
<i>...they may as well stay home, go to</i>
<i>the movies, or have a game of cards.</i>

239
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:56,490
<i>Or listen to the radio.</i>
<i>I'll be on the air all day Sunday...</i>

240
00:32:56,653 --> 00:33:00,532
<i>...probably talking a lot of</i>
<i>uninteresting nonsense.</i>

241
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:04,652
<i>So it's going to be a rainy Sunday,</i>
<i>with wet roads everywhere.</i>

242
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:06,883
<i>A flash from the news...</i>

243
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:10,568
<i>...that illustrates the weather</i>
<i>has just come in.</i>

244
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,731
<i>A man and a woman were killed</i>
<i>earlier today...</i>

245
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:17,325
<i>...when their sports car</i>
<i>skidded off the road.</i>

246
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,091
I hate hearing that.

247
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:21,931
Especially when driving.

248
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,448
Do I drive badly?

249
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,246
No. You drive normally.

250
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:34,088
<i>Now, let's change our mood</i>
<i>and listen to some light music.</i>

251
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:37,331
<i>Here's one you all know.</i>

252
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,924
You haven't told me what you do.

253
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:46,083
I've got a job that's...
That's very unusual.

254
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:48,164
Very original.

255
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,727
Which makes loads of money.

256
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,931
Shame on you!
And apart from that?

257
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:46,251
I've got a good front.

258
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,690
I'm in the motor business.
I'm a test driver.

259
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,524
-A racing driver?
-Yes.

260
00:35:01,013 --> 00:35:03,129
I think you soaked those people.

261
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:07,522
They're hunters.

262
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,246
No mercy on hunters!

263
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,770
She started to cough on Friday.

264
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:17,889
Nothing serious, but keep her warm.

265
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:20,529
There! There you are.

266
00:35:21,013 --> 00:35:23,368
You're not cold, darling. You're okay.

267
00:35:24,093 --> 00:35:25,082
Bye.

268
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:27,291
-I'm not surprised.
-What?

269
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,522
I'm not surprised.

270
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:32,403
I didn't see you on the 9:00 train.

271
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:35,685
Well, thank you. Goodbye.

272
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,122
Come on.

273
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,685
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

274
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,242
Bye, madame.

275
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:47,202
Are you happy?

276
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,961
Tell me some more about your job.

277
00:35:53,773 --> 00:35:56,333
-My job?
-Not about yours.

278
00:35:58,213 --> 00:35:59,612
Antoine, talk about my job.

279
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:02,009
-What?
-Don't you want to?

280
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,888
No, but I'll tell you all about
my job.

281
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:07,122
Go on, then.

282
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:09,284
The job I'll have when I'm big...

283
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:11,603
-Tell us.
-I want to be a fireman.

284
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:15,726
There'll be 36 firemen with me.

285
00:36:15,893 --> 00:36:16,882
Thirty-six?

286
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:19,248
But with me, it will make 37.

287
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,001
-You'll be the chief.
-Yes.

288
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:28,932
You know what? We'll have two big
fire engines with big ladders.

289
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,568
Very big.

290
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,962
The two fire engines will be huge
for the big fires.

291
00:36:38,253 --> 00:36:40,562
What will you do about small fires?

292
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,492
What about small fires?

293
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:45,727
We won't need the ladder.

294
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:50,771
That's all.
And we won't use much water.

295
00:36:51,853 --> 00:36:55,084
If it's locked,
we'll take the axes and...

296
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:58,929
Well, we'll use them to hit
and that's it.

297
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,607
And then we use a little water.
That's it.

298
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:06,485
Tell me about your job.

299
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:12,366
My work is largely technical. It bores
women to talk about technicalities.

300
00:37:12,653 --> 00:37:14,848
But I can tell you some trivia.

301
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,328
It wouldn't bore me.

302
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,570
Take superstition, for example.

303
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:24,203
We racing drivers are superstitious.
No car has number 1 3.

304
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:25,442
Really?

305
00:37:25,773 --> 00:37:26,762
No car ever...

306
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,810
No car ever bears number 1 3.

307
00:37:29,653 --> 00:37:32,804
Another number is 1 <i>7</i>,
many accidents for that one.

308
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:35,402
In Italy, for example,
there's never 17.

309
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,642
The Italians are very superstitious.

310
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,728
Have you ever heard of Ascari?

311
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:44,322
-I think so.
-Yes?

312
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:47,367
He was a driver, one of the best.

313
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,046
He died a few years ago.

314
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:50,288
Yes, I see now.

315
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:56,005
If Ascari saw a black cat on the track
or on the side of the track...

316
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,162
...he'd stop.

317
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:00,968
Antoine, your napkin.

318
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:03,328
Maybe they should eat, they're hungry.

319
00:38:04,253 --> 00:38:05,242
Here.

320
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,766
I don't like shrimps.

321
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,051
-You don't like shrimps?
-No.

322
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,963
Fran?oise, do you like shrimps?
No?

323
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:15,328
How come?
Last week you ate some.

324
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,927
Do you want tomatoes?
Do you like tomatoes?

325
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:19,412
-I'm not hungry.
-Not hungry?

326
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,928
It doesn't matter that
you don't like shrimps.

327
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,288
-But she likes shrimps.
-Do you?

328
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:27,404
But these are fresh, Antoine.

329
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,408
But, Fran?oise, you must eat something.

330
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,005
What do you of think while racing?

331
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,243
What is the most important thing?

332
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:40,207
The throb of the motor.

333
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:48,164
I know an engineer who uses
organ pipes for his exhaust.

334
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:52,048
It's something that you feel
through your whole body.

335
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:55,325
It grips you like a fever.

336
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:59,688
-I'm not thirsty, hungry. Sorry.
-I see.

337
00:39:00,093 --> 00:39:01,890
Antoine, say " Coca-Cola" in Spanish.

338
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:03,042
Coca-Cola.

339
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,965
-Same as in French.
-No.

340
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:08,649
Because the Spanish is " Coca-Cola. "

341
00:39:08,853 --> 00:39:11,845
-How do you say " I want a Coca-Cola" ?
-I want a Coca-Cola.

342
00:39:12,013 --> 00:39:16,962
The waiter's a Spaniard, so ask him
in Spanish for a Coca-Cola. Go on.

343
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,244
Go on and ask him for it.

344
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,924
-One Coca-Cola, for me.
-Yes, sir.

345
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,251
And one for the girl.

346
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,930
-He can give me some.
-We'll get you another glass.

347
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:35,692
Another glass, please.

348
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,806
Another glass, for the girl.

349
00:39:40,013 --> 00:39:42,163
How come he speaks
such good Spanish?

350
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,609
Actually, he speaks English too.

351
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:46,286
Ask for a glass in English.

352
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:50,289
-Yes, but the waiter is Spanish.
-He's also English.

353
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,603
His mum's English, his dad's a Spaniard.

354
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,725
He understands both languages.

355
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:59,604
-I'd rather say it in Spanish.
-You're right.

356
00:39:59,853 --> 00:40:02,321
Because it's more practical.

357
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,489
After an accident, how do you feel?

358
00:40:05,413 --> 00:40:06,607
You feel ashamed.

359
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:08,486
It's true, you're ashamed.

360
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,847
It's stupid, but that's how it is.

361
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:13,851
When you have an accident...

362
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,330
...it's your fault,
because you took a bend too fast.

363
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:21,122
For instance, a bend that you're
used to taking at 1 40...

364
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:25,764
...if you go in at 1 41 , you leave
the track, at 1 39, you lose the race.

365
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:28,643
You have to find the right speed.

366
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:30,725
Say " I love you" in Spanish.

367
00:40:32,093 --> 00:40:33,321
-To who?
-Francoise.
,

368
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,125
I love you.

369
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:46,811
When something's not serious,
we say it's like a film.

370
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,322
Why aren't films taken seriously,
do you think?

371
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:54,362
I don't know.

372
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,086
Maybe because we go
when everything's okay.

373
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,804
So we should go when it's not?

374
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:03,122
Why not?

375
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:07,289
It's gone. Taken off.
The plane has taken off.

376
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:12,484
-Can I clear the table, sir?
-Yes.

377
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:14,524
-May l, madame?
-Yes, thank you.

378
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:19,132
-Why do you break your cigarettes?
-To smoke less.

379
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:23,685
-You could smoke one less.
-True.

380
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,332
Antoine's suggested it.

381
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:30,169
Have you ever thought of becoming
an actress?

382
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,651
Yes, but it'd bore me.

383
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:35,042
Why?

384
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,126
I'm not sure.

385
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:42,522
Maybe because you need a little,
or not too much... I don't know.

386
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:45,962
It's not that complicated, is it?

387
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:49,611
No more difficult than being
a script girl or editor.

388
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,443
-Really?
-I don't know.

389
00:41:52,613 --> 00:41:55,685
You must have an idea.
After all, you watch films.

390
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:58,202
I don't know, it's not that difficult.

391
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:01,683
It's not a question of it being
a difficult job.

392
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:03,851
Everyone has their trade.

393
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,692
When you're good-looking,
it's not that difficult to...

394
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:09,922
You're handsome.

395
00:42:10,093 --> 00:42:11,651
The director matters most.

396
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:13,690
Why aren't you an actor?

397
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,926
You're not bad-looking.

398
00:42:16,173 --> 00:42:18,448
No. The idea never crossed my mind.

399
00:42:18,613 --> 00:42:23,164
But if I worked in the film business,
I'd rather be an actor, I think.

400
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,245
No, I'm delighted with my own craft.

401
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,449
No, I wouldn't have liked acting.

402
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:30,286
It's more serious to be...

403
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:33,013
It's not more serious,
it's more genuine.

404
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:41,369
I have so many questions.
I go to the movies pretty often.

405
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:43,806
I have lots of questions.

406
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:45,929
You must know a bit about films.

407
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:49,051
No more than most.
I know a few things.

408
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:51,085
I read some film magazines.

409
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:53,409
Well, you know, I'm not...

410
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:58,124
As I've been in films for a short time,
I haven't worked with the veterans.

411
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:02,127
Tell me more about actors
and actresses.

412
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,449
-Are you that interested?
-Of course.

413
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:10,964
You are a little girl and you are a big girl.

414
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,171
And you are a big...

415
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:17,807
...boy, and I am big boy.

416
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:20,012
-A big boy? No.
-Yes.

417
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:21,891
Have you had enough to eat?

418
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:23,691
Yes, but I'd love a coffee.

419
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:24,842
Coffee, please!

420
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:26,526
Antoine, be quiet!

421
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:31,692
What do you want to do?

422
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:34,606
Me, nothing.
I want to play, that's all.

423
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,331
How about a boat trip?

424
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:38,487
Yes! Let's go on a boat!

425
00:43:38,653 --> 00:43:39,847
-On a boat?
-Yes!

426
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,162
-I promised?
-Yes.

427
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,652
-You remember I promised?
-Yes.

428
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:44,372
-Have you been good?
-Yes.

429
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:45,522
All week?

430
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:46,808
Yes, he was!

431
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:48,452
-Was he good?
-Yes, yes.

432
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,292
Were you a good girl?

433
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,212
-Shall we find a boat?
-Yes!

434
00:43:52,373 --> 00:43:55,683
-Well, let's go! Come on. We're off.
-Yes!

435
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,210
I'll get there first!

436
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,129
Go and get your coats quickly, then.

437
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:09,767
You think it's okay for us
to go on a boat?

438
00:47:57,453 --> 00:47:59,683
They are loving every minute.

439
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:02,962
They get along pretty well together.

440
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:05,682
They've been friends for a long time.

441
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,481
Yes.

442
00:48:07,653 --> 00:48:11,646
Antoine noticed her ages ago,
he said Fran?oise was pretty.

443
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:14,771
He said he'd only spoken to her
a couple of times.

444
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,565
It's so cute.

445
00:48:24,173 --> 00:48:26,129
Detour

446
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:44,002
Beautiful, that man and his dog.

447
00:48:47,213 --> 00:48:49,522
They walk alike.

448
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,445
Yes, they do.

449
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:56,370
Do you know Giacometti, the sculptor?

450
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,524
Oh, yes. He was handsome.

451
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,446
Well, Giacometti once said:

452
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:07,651
"If caught in a fire and I had to choose
between a Rembrandt and a cat...

453
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:09,724
...I'd save the cat. "

454
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,212
"And then I'd let the cat go. "

455
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:16,331
-Did he say that too?
-That's what's so wonderful.

456
00:49:16,813 --> 00:49:18,405
Yes, it is.

457
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:22,570
Between art and life,
he said he'd choose life.

458
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:25,732
-Beautiful.
-Yes.

459
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,442
Why did you ask me that?

460
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:31,524
-About Giacometti?
-Yes.

461
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:34,571
Because of the man and his dog.

462
00:50:53,413 --> 00:50:55,643
You never speak about your wife.

463
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:15,206
My complete love
is with you always and forever.

464
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,329
Every second, till the end.

465
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:20,208
I love you, my darling!
I love you!

466
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:13,411

477
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:41,125
<i>Millions of viewers...</i>

478
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:46,321
<i>...have joined us for this race and will</i>
<i>stay with us for the next 24 hours.</i>

479
00:53:46,493 --> 00:53:50,532
<i>By the time we get</i>
<i>to our next report at 1 0 p.m...</i>

480
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:56,808
<i>...we have no doubt that the result</i>
<i>in the race will be far more predictable.</i>

481
00:55:04,133 --> 00:55:06,806
<i>As of this moment,</i>
<i>the Ferraris are leading.</i>

482
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:10,562
<i>As you know, Jean-Louis Duroc</i>
<i>has had a smashup.</i>

483
00:55:10,733 --> 00:55:15,648
<i>He piled up his car on the straight</i>
<i>run of the grandstand. It looked bad.</i>

484
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:20,329
<i>Jean-Louis Duroc was rushed</i>
<i>to the racetrack operating room.</i>

485
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:25,203
<i>He is still in a coma, but we will keep</i>
<i>you informed on this subject.</i>

486
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:29,969
<i>Right now, doctors are operating</i>
<i>on Jean-Louis Duroc.</i>

487
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:58,049
<i>The fiendish pace continues with</i>
<i>the Ferraris still holding their lead.</i>

488
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:02,092
<i>Last night produced a lot of dramatic</i>
<i>incidents and strained the machines.</i>

489
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:06,644
<i>Fifty percent of cars dropped out, to say</i>
<i>nothing of Duroc's serious accident.</i>

490
00:57:06,813 --> 00:57:09,327
<i>We reported</i>
<i>Jean-Louis Duroc's accident.</i>

491
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:12,371
<i>You know he underwent</i>
<i>a three-hour operation.</i>

492
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:18,608
<i>But a personal drama took place</i>
<i>in the hospital as he was unconscious.</i>

493
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:23,130
<i>However, let's go back</i>
<i>to the track to Graham Hill.</i>

494
00:57:23,293 --> 00:57:25,761
<i>He's at the pit</i>
<i>and still has a chance to win.</i>

495
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:30,052
<i>A sheer tragedy</i>
<i>stalked the corridors of the hospital.</i>

496
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:32,283
<i>Duroc's wife</i>
<i>got to the hospital...</i>

497
00:57:32,453 --> 00:57:35,889
<i>...only to be told of her husband's</i>
<i>critical condition.</i>

498
00:57:36,093 --> 00:57:38,891
<i>Then something awful happened.</i>

499
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:44,411
<i>Mrs. Duroc was very seriously shocked,</i>
<i>and she suffered a nervous breakdown.</i>

500
00:57:44,573 --> 00:57:50,045
<i>It has just been confirmed</i>
<i>that she has taken her own life.</i>

501
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:51,931
<i>For the moment,</i>
<i>we have no further details.</i>

502
00:57:52,133 --> 00:57:55,045
<i>We shall keep you informed</i>
<i>as they come in.</i>

503
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,124
<i>And now back to the track.</i>

504
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:24,366
All of next week, I'm going to be
driving in the Monte Carlo Rally.

505
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:26,569
But as soon as I come back...

506
00:58:26,733 --> 00:58:29,327
...Montmartre 1 5-40.

507
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:35,251
Well, then, good night.

508
00:59:16,973 --> 00:59:19,851
What time is it?

509
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:21,969
Five past 1 .

510
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:25,203
Did you have a good trip?

511
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,651
How's your son?

512
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,644
Fine.

513
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:33,523
-And you?
-Fine.

514
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:39,250
I've got some bad news for you.

515
00:59:40,053 --> 00:59:44,524
I knew you didn't find my desk.
I don't suppose you looked for it.

516
00:59:44,693 --> 00:59:49,289
I went to all the antique dealers
in Deauville, but no desk.

517
00:59:49,453 --> 00:59:51,045
Too bad.

518
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:56,092
Aren't you going to undress?

519
00:59:56,653 --> 00:59:58,883
Right away.

520
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:04,331
When am I going to meet your son?

521
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:08,008
When he's old enough
to seduce you.

522
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:10,812
I'd make a good mother.

523
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:13,282
I'm sure you would.

524
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:20,050
What's all this about
you going out with twins?

525
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:23,287
Who told you that?

526
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:26,247
The racing magazine.

527
01:00:26,413 --> 01:00:28,563
This one?

528
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:32,325
Which page?

529
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:35,929
Twenty-nine.

530
01:00:37,693 --> 01:00:38,887
<i>That's true.</i>

531
01:00:41,653 --> 01:00:43,883
You missed the best parts.

532
01:00:44,053 --> 01:00:48,410
"Today, the driver Jean-Louis Duroc
met a young woman in Deauville.

533
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:51,167
They spent the afternoon together...

534
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:56,646
...had lunch together,
and drove 400 kilometers together.

535
01:00:57,013 --> 01:00:59,322
They left each other
just over half an hour ago. "

536
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:07,085
Why are you telling me all this?

537
01:01:08,137 --> 01:01:10,571
Because it's the truth.

538
01:01:10,737 --> 01:01:13,092
This paper never tells lies.

539
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:39,249
<i>Here in Rheims, capital of Champagne,</i>
<i>the town is bubbling with excitement.</i>

540
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:44,445
<i>Excitement for the start of the</i>
<i>35th Monte Carlo Motor Rally...</i>

541
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:49,685
<i>...which is not being made any easier</i>
<i>by the difficult weather conditions.</i>

542
01:01:49,857 --> 01:01:53,532
<i>At this very moment, other competitors</i>
<i>leave from Oslo...</i>

543
01:01:53,697 --> 01:01:55,335
<i>...Minsk, London, Athens...</i>

544
01:01:55,497 --> 01:01:59,172
<i>...Lisbon and Hamburg,</i>
<i>273 competitors in all.</i>

545
01:02:00,137 --> 01:02:05,848
<i>They are about to start the 5000</i>
<i>kilometers of this very difficult race.</i>

546
01:02:06,017 --> 01:02:08,167
<i>And among those 273 competitors...</i>

547
01:02:08,337 --> 01:02:14,173
<i>...Jean-Louis Duroc</i>
<i>driving the Mustang number 1 45...</i>

548
01:02:14,337 --> 01:02:15,531
<i>...is about to leave.</i>

549
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:20,168
<i>Jean-Louis Duroc will share the driving</i>
<i>with his partner, Chemin.</i>

550
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:02,409
FORD TEAM CONFlDENT

551
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:18,287
Straight ahead, now.

552
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:28,288
Fork left.

553
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:44,054
Two kilometers.

554
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:05,174
<i>Now, hard left.</i>

555
01:05:15,457 --> 01:05:18,767
<i>As I speak to you, many contestants</i>
<i>dropped out of the race.</i>

556
01:05:18,937 --> 01:05:23,727
<i>Out of 273 cars that began,</i>
<i>only 80 are still in the running.</i>

557
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:29,017
<i>Many accidents have occurred</i>
<i>and countless difficulties...</i>

558
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:32,249
<i>...because of the extremely bad</i>
<i>weather conditions.</i>

559
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:37,810
<i>They have literally transformed</i>
<i>the roads into ice rinks.</i>

560
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:12,215
<i>Hairpin bend on the right.</i>

561
01:06:16,937 --> 01:06:19,167
<i>Sharp bend, left!</i>

562
01:08:21,857 --> 01:08:27,727
<i>The last and 42nd competitor</i>
<i>has just arrived at Monte Carlo.</i>

563
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:30,855
<i>Forty-two cars...</i>

564
01:08:31,057 --> 01:08:34,288
<i>...these figures speak for themselves.</i>

565
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:38,928
<i>A tough, grueling race</i>
<i>for both drivers and their cars.</i>

566
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:41,975
<i>Tonight, Monte Carlo,</i>
<i>famed for its casino...</i>

567
01:08:42,137 --> 01:08:46,813
<i>...is decked out to give a big welcome</i>
<i>to the tired heroes of today's race.</i>

568
01:08:46,977 --> 01:08:51,095
<i>We had hoped to bring you live</i>
<i>pictures of the prince and princess...</i>

569
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:55,216
<i>...but they were not able to be present</i>
<i>for the finish of the rally...</i>

570
01:08:55,377 --> 01:08:57,652
<i>...as we understand</i>
<i>they are away skiing.</i>

571
01:08:57,817 --> 01:09:01,890
<i>Therefore, they did not present</i>
<i>the trophy to the winners...</i>

572
01:09:02,057 --> 01:09:06,414
<i>...who in fact aren 't the real winners...</i>

573
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:10,775
<i>...because, as you know, Makinen and</i>
<i>the other competitors driving Coopers...</i>

574
01:09:10,937 --> 01:09:12,165
<i>...should have won.</i>

575
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:17,570
<i>However, a detail in one of the many</i>
<i>regulations deprived them of victory...</i>

576
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:21,286
<i>...but these trifles, we expect, will</i>
<i>be overlooked at tonight's banquet...</i>

577
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,608
<i>...given in honor of the competitors</i>
<i>at the Sporting Club...</i>

578
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:25,971
Hello?

579
01:09:26,137 --> 01:09:29,652
Hello, I want to send a telegram
to Monte Carlo.

580
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:31,694
Yes, I'll wait.

581
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:39,888
Yes, Monte Carlo.

582
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:42,093
Mr. Jean-Louis Duroc.

583
01:09:42,257 --> 01:09:45,454
Duroc. With a C.

584
01:09:45,617 --> 01:09:49,292
I haven't got the address
with me, unfortunately.

585
01:09:49,457 --> 01:09:50,810
I'm sorry to trouble you.

586
01:09:50,977 --> 01:09:53,093
It won't be difficult to find him.

587
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:56,215
He's in the Monte Carlo Rally.

588
01:09:57,177 --> 01:09:59,088
That's most kind of you.

589
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:01,730
Yes! That's it.

590
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:06,129
The Sporting Club will find him.
Let me see, now...

591
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:12,770
"Bravo! I saw you on TV. Anne. "

592
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:15,693
No, no, wait a second.

593
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,727
"Bravo! I love you. Anne. "

594
01:10:23,897 --> 01:10:25,888
Yes, please, yes.

595
01:10:26,057 --> 01:10:27,968
Montmartre 1 5-40.

596
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:31,686
Miss, how long will it take?

597
01:10:33,057 --> 01:10:34,490
Thank you.

598
01:12:43,577 --> 01:12:46,216
-Evening, sir.
-Sorry to draw you out in this cold.

599
01:12:46,377 --> 01:12:48,607
It is a bit nippy tonight,
but we mustn't complain.

600
01:12:48,777 --> 01:12:50,972
Comes during this time of the year.

601
01:12:51,137 --> 01:12:53,697
Super or regular?

602
01:12:53,857 --> 01:12:55,495
Super.

603
01:13:06,137 --> 01:13:08,776
-Fill it up, please.
-Fill it up?

604
01:13:10,937 --> 01:13:13,405
I'll fill it up for you,
but it's difficult for us.

605
01:13:13,577 --> 01:13:16,091
Never comes out even
and all the odd change.

606
01:13:16,257 --> 01:13:21,251
Every morning I have to do my accounts,
and that's not my strong point--

607
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:25,490
-Okay, then make it 50 francs.
-50 francs, that will be fine, sir.

608
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:37,012
-Aren't you going to turn it on?
-Yes, but your cigarette.

609
01:13:41,137 --> 01:13:45,096
<i>Sending that telegram really is</i>
<i>something. Takes guts to do that.</i>

610
01:13:45,257 --> 01:13:50,809
<i>Imagine, a beautiful woman</i>
<i>sends a cable like that to a man.</i>

611
01:13:50,977 --> 01:13:53,616
<i>I'd never have the guts to do that.</i>

612
01:13:53,777 --> 01:13:57,167
<i>A wonderful woman.</i>

613
01:14:01,657 --> 01:14:04,854
<i>If I keep going like this,</i>
<i>I should be in Paris around...</i>

614
01:14:06,577 --> 01:14:08,886
<i>...say, 6:30.</i>

615
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:13,334
<i>She's still in bed at 6:30.</i>

616
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:17,007
<i>What will I do? I can go to a bistro...</i>

617
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,215
<i>...give her a call...</i>

618
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:24,450
<i>When a woman sends you</i>
<i>a telegram, "I love you" ...</i>

619
01:14:24,617 --> 01:14:26,926
<i>...you go and see her.</i>

620
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:32,366
<i>Sure, I can go and see her...</i>

621
01:14:32,537 --> 01:14:36,052
<i>...but I don 't know which floor she's on.</i>
<i>I'd have to wake the concierge.</i>

622
01:14:39,337 --> 01:14:42,852
<i>The concierge will say,</i>
<i>"She's not in, " or, " You can 't go up. "</i>

623
01:14:43,017 --> 01:14:47,533
<i>I'll answer, "Look, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but I've just driven 5000 kilometers...</i>

624
01:14:47,697 --> 01:14:51,975
<i>...in fact, 6000 kilometers</i>
<i>to come and see her.</i>

625
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:54,856
<i>I'm very sorry, but...</i>

626
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:56,973
<i>...I'm going up!"</i>

627
01:14:57,137 --> 01:15:00,812
<i>Up I go! I ring the bell, once, twice.</i>

628
01:15:00,977 --> 01:15:04,333
<i>No, I think I'll only ring once,</i>
<i>don 't want to upset her.</i>

629
01:15:04,497 --> 01:15:07,807
<i>Once is enough.</i>

630
01:15:07,977 --> 01:15:11,287
<i>She'll take time to wake up,</i>
<i>perhaps she doesn 't open her door.</i>

631
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:13,493
<i>She says, " Who 's there?"</i>

632
01:15:13,657 --> 01:15:15,852
<i>And I answer, well...</i>

633
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:19,886
<i>What will I say?</i>

634
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,127
<i>I can 't say, "It's Jean-Louis. "</i>

635
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:24,768
<i>"Antoine's father, " I'll say.</i>

636
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,850
<i>Antoine's father.</i>
<i>Yes, that sounds better.</i>

637
01:15:29,017 --> 01:15:32,168
<i>"Who 's there?"</i>
<i>"Antoine's father. "</i>

638
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:35,329
<i>She opens the door...</i>

639
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:40,931
<i>...and we're face-to-face.</i>

640
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:46,456
<i>She's a little embarrassed.</i>

641
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:50,974
<i>After all, she sent me</i>
<i>a telegram, "I love you. "</i>

642
01:15:52,457 --> 01:15:54,413
<i>She's embarrassed. It's normal.</i>

643
01:15:54,577 --> 01:15:59,014
<i>She's home, and she's embarrassed.</i>

644
01:16:00,537 --> 01:16:05,133
<i>And she says, "I'll make some coffee.</i>

645
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:07,727
<i>You've come a long way, you need it. "</i>

646
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:12,049
<i>I walk in</i>-- <i>No,</i>
<i>now I have to say something.</i>

647
01:16:12,217 --> 01:16:15,892
<i>What a coward! So I say...</i>

648
01:16:18,097 --> 01:16:21,851
<i>Should I stop off in Lyons</i>
<i>and send her a telegram?</i>

649
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:25,248
<i>Yes, it's a good idea.</i>
<i>No, it's not, it's stupid.</i>

650
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:29,490
<i>My telegram would arrive</i>
<i>only a few minutes before I do.</i>

651
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:35,732
<i>She'll break her sleep, and when</i>
<i>I get there, I'll wake her again.</i>

652
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:40,688
<i>Lucky I've still got time</i>
<i>to think of something better.</i>

653
01:17:52,177 --> 01:17:55,567
-Anne Gauthier's apartment.
-Third floor.

654
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:36,613
Sorry, but I can't get any answer.

655
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:40,213
She doesn't always tell me
what she's doing.

656
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:49,009
Police!

657
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:52,692
I think she went to Deauville
to see her daughter.

658
01:18:52,857 --> 01:18:54,813
Much obliged.

659
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,896
I was extremely surprised
to see you back.

660
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:19,572
I saw you on television last night
at the Monte Carlo Rally.

661
01:19:19,737 --> 01:19:22,126
Do you think that if I go that way
I may run into them?

662
01:19:22,297 --> 01:19:25,573
Yes, you're almost sure to.
Past the big pier.

663
01:19:25,737 --> 01:19:27,807
The pier? Oh, yes!

664
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:32,368
If they come back while I'm looking
for them, tell them to wait for me.

665
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:35,256
See you in a while!

666
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:49,535
-Goodbye, Daddy.
-Goodbye, Mommy.

667
01:28:59,897 --> 01:29:01,535
But why?

668
01:29:09,457 --> 01:29:10,890
Why?

669
01:29:16,337 --> 01:29:18,328
Because of my husband.

670
01:29:20,457 --> 01:29:22,527
But he's dead.

671
01:30:31,097 --> 01:30:33,611
I think I'd better take the train.

672
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:05,691
Prepare my bill, please. Room 41 .

673
01:31:05,857 --> 01:31:09,247
And when is the next train for Paris?

674
01:33:05,977 --> 01:33:07,376
Is it direct?

675
01:33:07,537 --> 01:33:09,448
No, I have to change.

676
01:33:14,777 --> 01:33:18,531
For what reason did you say
your husband was dead?

677
01:33:19,497 --> 01:33:21,249
Because he is.

678
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:23,806
Not yet, for me.

679
01:33:26,097 --> 01:33:29,646
<i>Some Sundays start well and end badly.</i>

680
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,497
<i>It's hard to believe.</i>

681
01:33:32,657 --> 01:33:35,615
<i>It's crazy to refuse happiness.</i>

682
01:33:48,617 --> 01:33:51,529
<i>If I had to go through this again,</i>
<i>what would I do?</i>

683
01:33:51,697 --> 01:33:55,007
<i>Is there anything else I could do?</i>

684
01:33:55,777 --> 01:33:59,486
<i>To see her for months</i>
<i>on end as a pal.</i>

685
01:33:59,657 --> 01:34:04,094
<i>What happens?</i>
<i>You end up being pals, maybe.</i>

686
01:34:08,937 --> 01:34:11,576
<i>She wired, "I love you. "</i>

687
01:34:12,137 --> 01:34:15,368
<i>Admit it, boy, you just don 't</i>
<i>understand women.</i>

688
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:20,133
<i>Her husband</i>
<i>must have been quite a guy.</i>

689
01:34:20,297 --> 01:34:22,367
<i>Maybe if he had lived...</i>

690
01:34:25,377 --> 01:34:31,452
<i>...he'd have become an old fool,</i>
<i>but as it is, he'll always be quite a guy.</i>

691
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:36,530
<i>Though he might not have turned into</i>
<i>an old fool.</i>

692
01:34:36,697 --> 01:34:41,373
<i>They might've made</i>
<i>a wonderful couple...</i>

693
01:34:42,697 --> 01:34:45,370
<i>...or a dreary pair of old fools.</i>

694
01:34:45,897 --> 01:34:49,207
-<i>Are the Lyons sausages hot?</i>
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

695
01:34:49,377 --> 01:34:53,450
-<i>Where are they?</i>
-<i>Hors d'oeuvres.</i>

696
01:34:53,617 --> 01:34:55,209
<i>I don 't see it. Where is it marked?</i>

697
01:34:55,497 --> 01:34:58,136
<i>Lyons sausages. Milan sausages,</i>
<i>that's cold, isn 't it?</i>

698
01:34:58,297 --> 01:35:00,686
Oh, yes, always cold.

699
01:35:01,057 --> 01:35:04,174
What is the salmon steak
<i>à la maréchale</i>?

700
01:35:04,337 --> 01:35:07,488
Freshwater fish
imported from Finland.

701
01:35:09,817 --> 01:35:12,047
-Do you know it?
-No.

702
01:35:13,177 --> 01:35:15,088
-<i>What am I going to have?</i>
-<i>I don 't know.</i>

703
01:35:15,257 --> 01:35:16,576
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>

704
01:35:16,937 --> 01:35:18,848
<i>Would you like a steak?</i>

705
01:35:19,017 --> 01:35:20,416
<i>Yes. I think so.</i>

706
01:35:20,577 --> 01:35:23,535
<i>Chateaubriand's the most tender,</i>
<i>isn 't it?</i>

707
01:35:23,697 --> 01:35:26,165
<i>That's right, sir.</i>

708
01:35:28,057 --> 01:35:29,854
<i>Two Chateaubriands, grilled.</i>

709
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:31,655
Well-done or rare?

710
01:35:31,817 --> 01:35:34,729
-Rare, for me.
-Rare for me too.

711
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:37,809
-And hot!
-Of course, sir.

712
01:35:39,377 --> 01:35:42,608
Last night, what time
did you leave Monte Carlo?

713
01:35:42,777 --> 01:35:45,769
I left...

714
01:35:48,497 --> 01:35:51,807
You want nothing to start with, then?

715
01:35:54,857 --> 01:35:58,736
He's not too pleased with us.
We didn't order enough.

716
01:35:58,897 --> 01:36:00,728
You want me to make him happy?

717
01:36:01,017 --> 01:36:03,247
-Waiter.
-Yes, sir?

718
01:36:10,177 --> 01:36:12,816
Do you have a room?
