Prisoner Blomfeld,

95
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,690
do you seriously think
the Archbishop

96
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:23,724
is going to bother
to read this?

97
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,926
Let alone come
all the way out here

98
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:28,198
to see a convicted
death squad assassin?

99
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,038
Dismissed!
Get him out of here.

100
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,646
Check you later, <i>poes.</i>

101
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,953
Well...

102
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:53,754
they're right.

103
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,790
The tumor is halted,
Your Grace.

104
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:59,127
But it's too early
to be speaking of remission.

105
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,762
Only time will tell.

106
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,229
So I can be run over

107
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:04,098
by a bus tomorrow

108
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,968
and then I'll die
a healthy man.

[laughs]

110
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:09,903

on the radio.

112
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,041
Truth and reconciliation
between all sides

113
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,444
would be a fine thing.

114
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,945
But it's too early

115
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,247
for us to be speaking
of remission?

116
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,916
May I have a word
in private, Doctor Biehl,

117
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:24,919
away from these ears
of this old goat?

118
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,287
She's going to ask you
to ask me

119
00:09:27,289 --> 00:09:29,924
- to rest.
- No. I'm going to tell him

120
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:32,026
to order you to rest.

121
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,896
[Tutu] When Mandela
asked me to head

122
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:38,932
the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission,

123
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:41,835
he gave me a choice

124
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:44,138
precisely because he knew

125
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,840
I had no choice.

126
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,180
When the President speaks...

127
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,781
we have no choice,

128
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:54,348
do we, Doctor?

129
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,517
[Biehl] It seems not.

130
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,520
Exactly! See?

131
00:09:58,522 --> 00:09:59,857
Move.

132
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,291
[Sise] We grant amnesty
to a black face,

133
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,826
we are accused
of being biased;

134
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:08,061
if we grant amnesty
to a white,

135
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:10,931
we are accused of being
Boer stooges.

136
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,300
- It's impossible.
- [Mary Burton] Sise,

137
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,134
difficult is not
the same thing as impossible,

138
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,969
is it, Archbishop?

139
00:10:15,971 --> 00:10:17,774
Two politicians

140
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,211
are deadlocked.

141
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,177
In the end...

142
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,814
one says,

143
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,181
"Look,

144
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:30,285
I'll admit I'm wrong

145
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:33,923
if you'll admit I'm right."

146
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:37,559
"Agreed, agreed,

147
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,195
but you go first."

148
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:41,896
"Okay.

149
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,833
I'm wrong,"

150
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,300
says the first politician.

151
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,435
And the second politician yells,

152
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:50,140
he yells,

153
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:54,175
"You're right!
You're right!

154
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:56,009
You are wrong!
You are wrong!"

155
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,378
[laughter]

156
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,283
Bish, it's for you

157
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:08,890
Good people all over the world

158
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,859
are praying for our success.

159
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,361
Well, maybe they need

160
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,196
to pray a bit harder.

161
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,031
[Tutu] Oh, Alex, have hope.

162
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,236
[Lavinia] No. You're gonna need
stamina, leading that lot.

163
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:25,039
[Tutu] Yes. But if
the Commission can weld itself

164
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,877
into somewhat
of a united group,

165
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,882
then there's hope
for the nation.

166
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:37,153
[sighs]

167
00:11:48,097 --> 00:11:50,067
[Lavinia]
Is that Blomfeld's letter?

168
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:52,633
Yes, it is.

169
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:54,134
Which should have been shredded,

170
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:56,070
as I advised.

171
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:58,640
I can't get it out
of my head, Vinnie.

172
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:01,975
It is... it's so articulate.

173
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:05,216
He quotes Plato's <i>Republic</i>

174
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:08,650
and...

175
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:11,386
John Milton.

176
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:13,988
It's just...

177
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,589
it's quite engaging.

178
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,557
[Lavinia] Don't go to Pollsmoor,

179
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,093
that's my advice.

180
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:22,497
He's, um, only out
to harm you, you know,

181
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,531
he'll try and destroy you.

182
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,967
Don't exaggerate.

183
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,136
- Don't.
- [Lavinia] Father,

184
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,438
he's a psychopath
and a convicted killer.

185
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,006
I know who he is.

186
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,143
[Lavinia] Well, then?

187
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,046
No one...

188
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,681
is beyond redemption, Vinnie.

189
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:43,620

[Tannoy] <i>Prisoner Blomfeld,

<i>You have a visitor.</i>

00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:14,482

- [prisoner] Nice one.

195
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:16,184
[Blomfeld] Bloody Hell.

196
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,354
He fell over.

- [Tutu] Thank you, Sergeant.

200
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,546
[Blomfeld]
<i>The fucking prison bastard</i>

201
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:20,314
told me you wouldn't come.

202
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,650
"No way," he said.

203
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:23,718
But I knew you would come.

204
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,786
I knew you wouldn't be able

205
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:27,454
to resist it.

206
00:14:27,456 --> 00:14:29,424
Genius.

207
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:31,324
[Tutu] Well, you are sure

208
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,094
that I would come,

209
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:36,033
so I'm sure
that you are prepared.

210
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,398
Don't play with me, bru.

211
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,834
Don't delude yourself.

212
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:41,368
Delude myself?

213
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,570
[Blomfeld] Thinking
you can get inside here.

214
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,272
[Tutu] <i>Well, then</i>

00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,241

00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:51,112
This is no fucking game,

218
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,182
Hey. Hmm.

219
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,188
"Father."

220
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:02,025
"Father"...will do.

221
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,259
You got to be
kidding yourself

222
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:08,429
that what's gonna
happen here is random.

223
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:10,230
I've read all about you.

224
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:11,331
Studied it.

225
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,566
I've got plenty of time to do

226
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:13,569
what I need to do.

227
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:18,473
Mr. Blomfeld,

228
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:21,045
what is it that you want?

229
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:24,681
Is it amnesty?

230
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,815
And if it is?

231
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,417
[Tutu] Well, now,

232
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,652
I'm not saying that I can even

233
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:35,623
consider your application.

234
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,825
But if you want to be free,

235
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,462
from then part of the process

236
00:15:41,464 --> 00:15:43,131
in seeking amnesty...

237
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:44,699
"Involves making a full

238
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:46,133
and frank confession,

239
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,535
leaving nothing out."

240
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,637
I know, I can bloody read.

241
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,339
You will have
to seek forgiveness.

242
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,541
You must ask for it.

243
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,310
Forgiveness?

244
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,778
Forgiveness for what?

245
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,616
For offing some black
bastard thieving scum

246
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:04,151
- trying to steal my country?
- It's our country.

247
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,619
Fuck that! Your country.

248
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,787
What have your people
ever done to build it?

249
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:10,791
Two years ago,
we had an election.

250
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,227
A free election,

251
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:15,897
where anyone who wanted

252
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,333
to vote could do so

253
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:21,872
without violence.

254
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,577
Now, that is an achievement.

255
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,647
That's what helps you sleep
easy at night, is it?

256
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,182
Pride in your achievement,

257
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:36,449
hmm?

258
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:38,422
- Listen, boy...
- Uh-uh,

259
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,559
"Father." We agreed on that.

260
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:47,527
How does it feel...
hmm?...

261
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,498
...colluding with your
former white masters?

262
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,532
Colluding?

263
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,502
- In what way?
- [Blomfeld] Once a slave,

264
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,270
always a slave.

265
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:58,205
Your white masters
haven't gone away,

266
00:16:58,207 --> 00:16:59,473
have they?

267
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,608
You're still serving them

268
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,209
the same <i>kak!</i>

269
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,611
Except now it's called

270
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:06,213
"reconciliation".

271
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:07,614
You're covering them,

272
00:17:07,616 --> 00:17:09,683
that's what it amounts to.

273
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,885
Come on,

274
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:12,953
be honest,

275
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,222
it's easy if you try.

276
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:17,892
We either learn to live together

277
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,794
in this country

278
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:21,696
or we will die together

279
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,663
in this country.

280
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,665
Well done, <i>kaffir!</i>

281
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,301
[speaking foreign language]

282
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:29,636
You've grasped
the bottom line.

283
00:17:29,638 --> 00:17:33,306
Life is one animal
eating another.

284
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:34,709
Death is one animal

285
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:35,910
being eaten by another.

286
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,878
You either have a full belly

287
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,946
or you're in a full belly.

288
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,615
Darwin. Unalterable facts.

289
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:43,517
The rest is just
window dressing.

290
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:44,788
Chintz.

291
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,258
We are all God's children.

292
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,258
We are all connected

293
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,363
by a common humanity.

294
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,535
I could tell you a thing
or two about humanity,

295
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:01,802
about what's buried
in the red earth

296
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,541
of this country, hmm?

297
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,508
About "Disappearing,"

298
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,011
about the "Elimination,"

299
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:14,315
about the "Unconventional
Operational Methods,"

300
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,920
about "Hit Squads,"
about "Hacksaw".

301
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,488
Oh, yeah.

302
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,295
So you think we share
a common humanity, <i>kaffir?</i>

303
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:28,828
We are...

304
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,033
all capable of acts
of depravity.

305
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,668
[Blomfeld] Even you? Yes?

306
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,469
Yes, even me.

307
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,505
Good boy!

308
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,673
Now, the truth: when you sit
on that commission of yours,

309
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:41,444
don't tell me
you don't feel anger?

310
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,879
Oh, I feel anger.

311
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,515
[Blomfeld]
And you wonder, don't you?

312
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,849
Why God just doesn't

313
00:18:48,851 --> 00:18:50,517
fucking wipe the slate clean

314
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,355
of his two-legged creation?

315
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,627
Sometimes I wonder that.

316
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,032
I feel sorry for you,

317
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:06,536
mission-school boy.

318
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,338
Turn the other cheek, hey?

319
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,607
To forgive is a choice

320
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,378
made by other ordinary people

321
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,447
much more courageous

322
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,382
- than I will ever be.
- Ah! Come on!

323
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:24,785
Be a man. Own the fire
in your belly.

324
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:27,755
- Go for it.
- I refuse your version

325
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:29,590
of humanity,

326
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:31,926
and I intend to continue

327
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:33,827
to struggle...

328
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:34,897
against it.

329
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,873
How many on that commission
of yours are priests?

330
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,107
Four.

331
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,910
Clever, our leaders,
aren't they?

332
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:53,413
Forgiveness is fucking baked
into the cake.

333
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,949
Civil war,

334
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:57,653

[Blomfeld] A blood bath

The visit's over!

Why did you ask me
to come here, Mr. Blomfeld?

355
00:20:58,146 --> 00:21:01,451
To offer you the very thing
you thought to offer me.

Do you people think
you're better than us?

471

is because,

00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:40,574
[Burly]
No, they've got nothing on us...

502
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,142
It's a <i>klomp kak.</i>

503
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:44,547
We just need to keep quiet,
keep our mouths shut.

504
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:47,616
Mosi, come.

505

[woman speaking

507
00:29:22,017 --> 00:29:23,920
So many secrets.

508
00:29:25,153 --> 00:29:27,653
It's like a cancer.

509
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:31,525
Is it that evil creature
in Pollsmoor?

510
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:34,330
Don't let him inside,
you hear me?

511
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:39,266
If I'm the only person
that he's inside,

512
00:29:39,268 --> 00:29:41,904
then it wouldn't be so bad.

513
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:47,106
Note to self then,
Archbishop,

514
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:49,575
don't go back into Pollsmoor.

515
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:52,379
You hear me?

516
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:54,180
Vinnie, can you...

517
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:56,516
can you get Oliver
or one of our researchers

518
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:58,986
to look and to give me
information

519
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:02,458
on this secret operation
called "Hacksaw"?

520
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,428
Okay.

- [man] ...huh?
- Of course, sir.

523
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:33,990
Huh, do you?

524
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,005
What do you advise me?

[men hooting]

00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:34,547
Why Mogomat?

Yes, Benjamin's a bitch.

He's the general's wife.

[laughter]

535
00:32:53,528 --> 00:32:55,629
[Tutu] Please explain to us

536
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,634
the purpose of the SSA.

537
00:33:00,736 --> 00:33:03,539
[Mosi] The SSA, Security police,

538
00:33:05,641 --> 00:33:07,743
its purpose was to extract
information.

539
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:11,710
We were told
to keep it clean,

540
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:12,714
but, uh...

541
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:16,850
[Tutu] Go on,

542
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:18,584
Mr. Xhosa.

543
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:22,389
Torture included
the punching of genitals

Sorry.

mean anything to you?

551
00:33:53,689 --> 00:33:54,955
No.

552
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:58,257
[Tutu]
What about operation Hacksaw?

553
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:00,326
[counsel] Mr. Chairman,

554
00:34:00,328 --> 00:34:02,962
I must interrupt this witness.
I have here

555
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:05,899
a High Court order
of <i>sub judice</i>

556
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:07,968
that forbids further testimony
of this witness.

557
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,907
[indistinct chatter]

[laughs]

559
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,680
Really?

00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:22,684
Alex.

561
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:29,825
Colonel,

562
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,459
do you have nothing to say

563
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:35,762
to these families?

564
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:38,465
To David Lyon's family

565
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:39,932
or...

566
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:42,572
Simba Goniwe's family.

567
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:47,574
Families who have
had no news

568
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:50,709
of their beloved son

569
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:53,780
or their adored husband

570
00:34:53,782 --> 00:34:54,884
for years.

571
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:02,521
Do you have nothing to say

572
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:05,327
that would ease their pain?

573
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:09,929
That might give them...

574
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,798
closure?

575
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,971
I will say only this,
Archbishop,

576
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:18,637
we were fighting a war

577
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:20,740
against communism.

578
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,976
I was battling a threat
to us all.

579
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:25,577
Communist regimes,

580
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:27,813
harsh, repressive regimes,

581
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:30,518
intent on making
Africa theirs.

582
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,793
Colonel,

583
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,996
look at the faces

584
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:45,300
of these families.

585
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:52,307
They are your own people!

586

[woman

587
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,882
Colonel, you cannot change

588
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,083
what is over

589
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,655
or where you have been,

590
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:10,456
but you can change

591
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,028
where you now go.

592
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:16,595
[counsel] Mr. Chairman,

593
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:19,065
I have lodged a complaint
with the Public Protector

594
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,501
to have a declaration
that this proceeding

595
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:24,903
is a politically
motivated slur

596
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:27,407
against my client's
honor and integrity,

597
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:29,045
and that of the SADF.

598
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,579
Really, son?

599
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:37,816
[colonel] This farrago...

600
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,985
is alienating a large sector

601
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,854
of white South Africa.

602
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,889
Now, if that was
your intention,

603
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,557
you have achieved it.

604
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,726
And I do not see
how this furthers the aim

605
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:51,030
of peace
and reconciliation.

606
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:54,836
- [scattered applause]

[Tutu] Everyone,

00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:14,022
we are taking
a five-minute break, please.

609
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,735
Mrs. Morobe,

610
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:30,470
Kefilwe,

611
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:33,472
what are you
still doing here?

612
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:37,075
We're just sitting.

613
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:38,744
See,

614
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:41,046
tomorrow,
Mpho is turning 20.

615
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:43,119
I have candles to light.

616
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:46,021
Twenty.

617
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:49,054
You should go home.

618
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:51,724
When I get news of Mpho,

619
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,827
I will tell you, I promise.

620
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,563
Oh, she was...

621
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,965
always wanting to study.

622
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,869
Perhaps to be a doctor.

623
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:04,938
She always saved
for books.

624
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,005
Yes.

625
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:07,675
Kefilwe knows.

626
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,683
How can I pray for her

627
00:38:17,751 --> 00:38:19,755
if I don't know
what happened?

628
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:31,666
[dramatic music playing]

629
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:37,237
[Leah] Good evening.
So how did it go?

630
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,838
[Tutu] Interesting.

631
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,940
Well, I see you won't come in
for your cocoa,

632
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:42,508
so I come out here.

633
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,943
- [music playing]
- [Tutu] Good night.

634
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:47,947
[man speaks foreign language]

635
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:50,249
This music
always reminds me

636
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:53,489
of President Mandela's
inauguration.

637
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:55,988
I played it for them.

638
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,291
They wanted to know
about that day.

639
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:02,195
But how do you convey it,

640
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:04,831
that sense of freedom?

641
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:08,267
That, uh,
that first moment,

642
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:09,802
the taste of it.

643
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:13,206
That sweet, sweet nectar.

644
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:16,175
How do you convey it

645
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:19,012
to someone who was born

646
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,280
into freedom?

647
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,648
You can't. You can't.

648
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,284
Oh, my dear,
drink your cocoa,

649
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:25,753
it's getting cold.

650
00:39:29,023 --> 00:39:30,092
Remember...

651
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,592
those jets

652
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:36,095
flying overhead,

653
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:37,829
streaming smoke

654
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:41,536
in the colors
of the new national flag

655
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:43,771
and...

656
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:48,307
everybody cheering.

657
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:50,577
Yes. And you dancing

658
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,845
with that
fat white businessman

659
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:54,182
like two seals.

660
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,316
He wasn't a businessman.

661
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,121
That's what
I was telling them.

662
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:02,956
He was Nelson Mandela's...

663
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:06,092
ex-jailer.

664
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:09,731
And we were dancing
because...

665
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:14,934
those jets
flying overhead,

666
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:16,105
they were ours.

667
00:40:17,606 --> 00:40:19,108
Not someone else's.

668
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,845
Ours.

669
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:25,981
We were free.

Hmm?

676

Mrs. Morobe

Mpilo,

681
00:41:00,715 --> 00:41:03,849

682
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:06,019
you know I've had
mixed feelings

683

about you continuing
the chairmanship.

684
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,356
Huh? What?

685
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:11,990
Why didn't you
tell me before?

686
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:14,693
Oh, Desmond Mpilo Tutu,
you are incorrigible.

687
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:16,996
[laughs]
There's still some life

688
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:18,865
in this old goat
yet then, huh?

689
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:21,934
And I know it's important
for Mrs. Morobe,

690
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:24,103
for all of us,

691
00:41:24,105 --> 00:41:26,304
this Blomfeld man.

692
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:28,206
Lavinia wants me
to get you to promise

693
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,941
never to see him again.

694
00:41:29,943 --> 00:41:32,110
She says
he's very dangerous.

695
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:34,780
She showed me
his letter.

696
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:37,816
God knows
what goes in his head.

697
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:40,186
He's very clever.

698
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:42,421
That doesn't mean that
he should get the last word.

699
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:44,791
Yes, which is exactly why

700
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,226
I asked Varney
to get you his file.

00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:25,913
amnesty for your crimes

835
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:29,718
is highly unlikely.

836
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:34,385
You showed your victims

837
00:50:34,387 --> 00:50:35,820
no mercy,

838
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:39,825
and besides the...

839
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:41,897
extreme brutality,

840
00:50:43,431 --> 00:50:45,697
your crimes reveal

841
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:48,903
no political context.

842
00:50:53,507 --> 00:50:55,710
No political context?

843
00:50:57,677 --> 00:50:59,278
My context,

844
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,912
as you call it,

845
00:51:00,914 --> 00:51:04,849
stretches back
some 300 years.

846
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:07,385
When my ancestors
were farming this land

847
00:51:07,387 --> 00:51:10,021
and building its cities,

848
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:12,391
yours were creeping out
of the bush,

849
00:51:12,393 --> 00:51:13,827
trying to murder them.

850
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:16,829
That's context.

851
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:20,501
My people were murdered
by yours.

852
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:23,836
In Zimbabwe.
Yes, I know.

853
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,871
Zimbabwe, South Africa?
Same difference.

854
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:27,740
[Tutu] Is it?
Is it the same?

855
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:29,541
I don't know.
You're the expert on context.

856
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:30,711
You tell me.

857
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:36,949
Your people

858
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:39,617
[laughs]

859
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:41,690
believed in this...

860
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,659
this little
subversive book.

861
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:50,662
It's a beautiful
little book.

862
00:51:50,664 --> 00:51:52,400
It's my favorite,

863
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,068
which teaches us,

864
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,771
"Proclaim liberty

865
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:02,441
to the captive,

866
00:52:02,443 --> 00:52:05,747
sight to the blind

867
00:52:07,447 --> 00:52:12,786
and to set
the oppressed free."

868
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,890
That's in Luke 4:18.

869
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:23,028
Your people...

870
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,930
felt they were being
oppressed

871
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:27,335
by the British,

872
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:31,769
they fought back

873
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:33,574
and they became free.

874
00:52:35,608 --> 00:52:38,409
So you need to learn

875
00:52:38,411 --> 00:52:40,912
from your own history

876
00:52:40,914 --> 00:52:43,449
that when a people

877
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:47,355
decide to be free,

878
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:52,360
my dear friend,
nothing,

879
00:52:53,793 --> 00:52:57,929
absolutely nothing

880
00:52:57,931 --> 00:53:00,301
is gonna stop them
from becoming free.

881
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:06,371
[clapping]

882
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:08,639
Yes. Very good.

883
00:53:08,641 --> 00:53:11,443
Very high-minded of you.

884
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:14,746
But there's something
you just don't get, <i>kaffir.</i>

885
00:53:14,748 --> 00:53:18,550
Something you just
do not get.

886
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:21,854
Killing someone
is never political,

887
00:53:21,856 --> 00:53:24,923
no matter what
anyone says.

888
00:53:24,925 --> 00:53:28,028
Killing someone
is personal.

889
00:53:30,831 --> 00:53:33,867
It's always,
always personal.

890
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,972
It's simple.

891
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:42,974
You like to read, eh?

892
00:53:42,976 --> 00:53:45,778
Study on this,

893
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,514
"Unconquerable will,

894
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,416
study of revenge,

895
00:53:50,418 --> 00:53:52,950
immortal hate,

896
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:55,653
courage to never submit
or yield,

897
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:58,460
what else is not
to be overcome?

898
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:02,059
Better to reign in Hell

899
00:54:02,061 --> 00:54:04,128
than to serve in Heaven."

900
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,833
Lucifer.

901
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:10,070
You quoted that poem
in your letter.

902
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,809
So papa was a teacher,
so I'm assuming he knows

903
00:54:16,811 --> 00:54:19,381
it's "Paradise Lost."

904
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:23,048
And if you don't,
you're just one more

905
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,388
half-educated <i>mzee</i>
in my eyes.

906
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,590
You're a dreamer, my old Hotnot.

907
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:32,990
I grant you that.

908
00:54:32,992 --> 00:54:35,159
A fucking dreamer.

909
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,528
Dreamer?

910
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,565
Yes.

911
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:42,834
I, for 40 years,

912
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:45,970
I dreamed of voting...

913
00:54:45,972 --> 00:54:49,240
freely in a free country

914
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:51,742
in the land of my birth.

915
00:54:51,744 --> 00:54:55,416
For 40 years,
I've been in the wilderness.

916
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,688
Now, it's finally
come to pass.

917
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:09,628
There was this one
neutralization

918
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,762
and I was standing there
on this <i>stoep</i>

919
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:15,566
covered in <i>kaffir</i> brain,
and blood, and shit.

920
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:16,969
My old head was throbbing

921
00:55:16,971 --> 00:55:20,037
<i>like</i> babelaas...

922
00:55:20,039 --> 00:55:22,677
<i>and after the killings,
we set a fire.</i>

923
00:55:24,777 --> 00:55:26,945
And I could hear this voice
inside my head

924
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:29,947
as clear as you're
hearing me now,

925
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:33,050
telling me I had no dreams,

926
00:55:33,052 --> 00:55:36,688
no passion, no hope.

927
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,526
"What is life without
them things?" it asked me.

928
00:55:41,528 --> 00:55:44,595
"I have passion, I have dreams."

929
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:47,532
I remember shouting back.

930
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:49,534
And all the boys were there,

931
00:55:49,536 --> 00:55:53,070
Francois, Hansie,
all the Hacksaw boys,

932
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:54,673
<i>they were watching me
through the flames.</i>

933
00:55:54,675 --> 00:55:56,711
<i>The whole time that voice,</i>

934
00:55:58,012 --> 00:56:00,612
"What dreams, what dreams?"

935
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:02,182
I had dreams!

936
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:08,287
I had dreams once, I did.

937
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:12,227
But you fucking people,
you stole them from me.

938
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:23,101
How... How old...

939
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:26,938
were you when you
joined the AWB?

940
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,876
What the fuck is that
got to do with anything?

941
00:56:30,878 --> 00:56:34,045
How old?

942
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,250
Seventeen.

943
00:56:37,117 --> 00:56:40,121
And what has it got
you, Mr. Blomfeld,

944
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:47,992
33 years of hate?

945
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:50,028
Fuck you.

946
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,597
It's too much for you,
isn't it?

947
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,930
The Commission?

948
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,333
That's plain enough.

949
00:56:55,335 --> 00:56:57,970
I didn't come here
to discuss The Commission.

950
00:56:57,972 --> 00:57:01,238
You can't forgive
the likes of me.

951
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,978
Breaking your faith,
isn't it, eh?

952
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:09,880
I have watched the light
of life flicker out and die

953
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:12,217
behind the eyes of so many
I have done.

954
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:15,623
That is cock-stiffening,
I can tell you.

955
00:57:18,925 --> 00:57:22,663
I have ministered
to the dying,

956
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:26,934
and I'm no stranger
to death.

957
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:30,202
First,
when the knife goes in,

958
00:57:30,204 --> 00:57:31,970
they just don't believe it.

959
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:33,575
They are in shock.

960
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:37,175
Then is coming acceptance.

961
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,744
Oh, yeah.

962
00:57:39,746 --> 00:57:43,048
They are grateful,
aren't they?

963
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:45,751
Sometimes I feel
I can almost

964
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:48,920
hear them whispering,

965
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:52,257
"Thank you,

966
00:57:52,259 --> 00:57:53,728
thank you."

967
00:57:57,664 --> 00:58:00,264
So don't you come in here
and pontificate,

968
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,367
you self-righteous doff.

969
00:58:03,369 --> 00:58:05,903
TRC has broken you inside,

970
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:08,940
made the sham of your faith.

971
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:11,208
I'm right, aren't I?

972
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,045
You can't forgive the beasts

973
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:16,748
that you confront every day.

974
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:18,916
[laughs]

975
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:20,918
That cancer
is eating you alive.

976
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,820
You are so finished, boy.

977
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:26,691
Don't you call me "boy"
again, Blomfeld.

978
00:58:26,693 --> 00:58:28,096
[Blomfeld] Or what?

979
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:43,176
Under your mask...

980
00:58:47,246 --> 00:58:50,115
you're riddled

981
00:58:50,117 --> 00:58:51,919
with self-loathing.

982
00:59:05,465 --> 00:59:07,499
[sobs]

983
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,104
Easier to...

984
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:17,075
to be angry at the world

985
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:19,447
than to be angry at yourself.

986
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:23,150
I understand.

987
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:35,894
When they arrested you,

988
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:38,166
you had this on you.

989
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:44,869
You hung onto it

990
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:47,942
for 40 years.

991
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:50,478
Why?

992
01:00:01,255 --> 01:00:02,423
Visit's over.

993
01:00:05,025 --> 01:00:06,193
What happened?

994
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:10,394
And don't hide behind

995
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:14,000
Aristotle, or Plato,
or Milton.

996
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,068
You're right,

997
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,938
you're right.

998
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,108
I have to stare in the mirror

999
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:28,014
at myself every day,

1000
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:33,453
and so do you.

01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:20,760
but it was whites only?

1165
01:12:22,127 --> 01:12:24,728
[Leah] Uh, they wanted
to swim so badly

1166
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:26,964
but the look
on their faces,

1167
01:12:26,966 --> 01:12:29,232
I was so angry.

1168
01:12:29,234 --> 01:12:32,702
[Tutu] Yes,
and humiliated.

1169
01:12:32,704 --> 01:12:34,173
I felt that way

1170
01:12:35,841 --> 01:12:37,575
the other day
at Pollsmoor.

1171
01:12:37,577 --> 01:12:39,977
[Leah] I see,

1172
01:12:39,979 --> 01:12:42,112
Pollsmoor.

1173
01:12:42,114 --> 01:12:45,916
Reminded me
of when I was a small boy,

1174
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:48,188
walking to school
with my father,

1175
01:12:49,788 --> 01:12:52,658
crossing that white area,

1176
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:56,326
watching my father's face

1177
01:12:56,328 --> 01:13:00,733
as he had to show
his pass to police

1178
01:13:02,001 --> 01:13:04,268
and them yelling at him

1179
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,870
and call him names.

1180
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:09,809
And he endured it all
for my sake.

1181
01:13:11,743 --> 01:13:14,144
I just... I just...

1182
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:16,149
I just stood there.

1183
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:21,018
I couldn't take away

1184
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,756
his humiliation.

1185
01:13:25,992 --> 01:13:29,162
I... I failed him.

1186
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:33,066
Leah, I failed him.

1187
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:37,168
Maybe that lost soul

1188
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,369
in Pollsmoor

1189
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:39,706
is right.

1190
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,175
Maybe I'm just...

1191
01:13:45,011 --> 01:13:48,782
an... an--an old fraud...

1192
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:54,050
delusional, and...

1193
01:13:54,052 --> 01:13:55,055
and...

1194
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:59,123
- unworthy.
- Oh,

1195

No.

So what are you
talking about?

1198
01:14:05,664 --> 01:14:07,397
You've spent
a lifetime

1199

defending the dignity
of others.

Never to give up, never.

You're not going

Absolutely not.

Over what, huh?

with God.

1351
01:27:04,009 --> 01:27:06,041
So angry with God, I said,

1352
01:27:06,043 --> 01:27:08,477
"How can you allow
such and such and such

1354
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:12,949

But then,

1359

Rian Blomfeld, Piet's father,
was a bigoted monster.

After it was over,

1440

he broke his arm.

1442

And then the family
moved to Zimbabwe

1443
01:33:56,822 --> 01:33:59,923
and they sent Piet
to a white boarding school.

1664

<i>That money
I leave to you, Benjamin,</i>

[Linda] Oh,
I wanted to talk to you.

1673
01:51:17,228 --> 01:51:18,559
[Tutu] Sit down.

1674
01:51:18,561 --> 01:51:19,797
[Linda] Okay.

1675
01:51:25,368 --> 01:51:28,637
I've come to thank you.

1676
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,007
You know, for what
you've been doing,

1677
01:51:32,009 --> 01:51:33,875
shining a light

1678
01:51:33,877 --> 01:51:35,479
into a dark place.

1679
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:41,316
You are a brave woman,

1680
01:51:41,318 --> 01:51:44,085
Mrs. Coetzee.

1681
01:51:44,087 --> 01:51:47,955
I hated you at first.

1682
01:51:47,957 --> 01:51:50,025
[chuckles]

1683
01:51:50,027 --> 01:51:51,326
Of course.

1684
01:51:51,328 --> 01:51:53,094
I'm just as easy to hate

1685
01:51:53,096 --> 01:51:54,599
as I am to love.

1686
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:59,166
Well, I just...
I guess I just...

1687
01:51:59,168 --> 01:52:00,537
I lived in a bubble.

1688
01:52:02,273 --> 01:52:04,373
But now I ask myself,

1689
01:52:04,375 --> 01:52:06,508
"How could I not see?"

1690
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:08,677
I'm not talking
just about Hansi.

1691
01:52:08,679 --> 01:52:10,611
I guess I'm really
talking about

1692
01:52:10,613 --> 01:52:13,415
everything that's been
going on.

1693
01:52:13,417 --> 01:52:17,184
I pretended that
it wasn't happening, but...

1694
01:52:17,186 --> 01:52:21,156
I knew.

1695
01:52:21,158 --> 01:52:22,691
And at this point,

1696
01:52:22,693 --> 01:52:24,996
probably doesn't
mean much, but...

1697
01:52:27,163 --> 01:52:30,300
I want to say I'm sorry.

1698
01:52:32,302 --> 01:52:34,635
Why doesn't it mean much

1699
01:52:34,637 --> 01:52:37,408
to say you're sorry?

1700
01:52:39,143 --> 01:52:41,276
I guess because I think that

1701
01:52:41,278 --> 01:52:43,611
I'm a bad person

1702
01:52:43,613 --> 01:52:46,250
and that you'll think
these are just white tears.

1703
01:52:49,019 --> 01:52:52,720
Happily, tears,

1704
01:52:52,722 --> 01:52:54,524
they don't have any color

1705
01:52:56,193 --> 01:52:59,561
and I think you're a person

1706
01:52:59,563 --> 01:53:01,996
in need of a hug

1707
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:04,568
just like the rest of us.

1708
01:54:05,628 --> 01:54:07,294
[Leah] What was that for?

1709
01:54:07,296 --> 01:54:09,296
[Tutu] I'm sorry.

1710
01:54:09,298 --> 01:54:10,732
These last two years
have been

1711
01:54:10,734 --> 01:54:12,366
hard for you, Leah.

1712
01:54:12,368 --> 01:54:13,501
But I just want you
to know

1713
01:54:13,503 --> 01:54:15,202
I never took you
for granted.

1714
01:54:15,204 --> 01:54:16,470
Never.

1715
01:54:16,472 --> 01:54:19,074
[Leah] Why, you old goat,

1716
01:54:19,076 --> 01:54:21,543
are you asking me
for forgiveness?

1717
01:54:21,545 --> 01:54:22,643
[Tutu]
I suppose I am.

1718
01:54:22,645 --> 01:54:23,812
[Leah laughs]

1719
01:54:23,814 --> 01:54:25,379
[Tutu] Look at it.

1720
01:54:25,381 --> 01:54:27,281
What a beautiful sight.

1721
01:54:27,283 --> 01:54:30,285
[Leah] Yes, the sea
and all its colors.

1722
01:54:30,287 --> 01:54:31,519
I've always loved them.

1723
01:54:31,521 --> 01:54:32,720
[Tutu] No, no, no, I mean,

1724
01:54:32,722 --> 01:54:36,391
here on the beach.

1725
01:54:36,393 --> 01:54:38,360
Our beach.
