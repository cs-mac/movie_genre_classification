{2517}{2565}Scared the living crap out of me.
{2565}{2613}Meryl Streep that girl was not.
{2613}{2661}Who's Meryl Streep?
{2661}{2733}Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes|to our parents.
{2733}{2805}So, what's next, ladies?
{2805}{2853}-I have to go home.|-No.
{2853}{2949}Yes. Make that a block from home. I can't have another|close encounter with my parents. They think I'm home in bed.
{2973}{3020}Were you kids in bed at a reasonable hour?
{3020}{3092}-I stayed up till 10.|-After 9, Rhett was fast asleep.
{3116}{3140}-Who's driving this monsters?|-I will.
{3164}{3236}Nicky's selling coffee at school,|and I promised I'd help her.
{3284}{3308}It sucks.
{3308}{3380}Do not say "sucks," say "disappoints". Or "bites".
{3476}{3524}I don't need a lunch.|I can walk across the street with Tash.
{3548}{3596}And have pizza three days in a row?|I think not.
{3620}{3644}That's really good.
{3668}{3716}The proportions are perfect...
{3716}{3788}...but are you drawing|what you are really seeing?
{3788}{3908}The simplest thing is the hardest.|To see what's really right in front of you.
{4219}{4243}Hey. So, what's funs are offered for tonight?
{4267}{4363}I am so grounded. I got busted by my red|sneaking back inside last night.
{4363}{4459}-Damn, girl, how'd you manage to do that?|-My dad set the motion detector.
{4459}{4531}Seems that our parents are getting|paranoid about us in their old age.
{4555}{4603}Mine still trust me.
{4675}{4723}It's beautiful.
{4771}{4819}Well... Hasn't been a bad|couple of decades, considering.
{4843}{4891}For me, better than the first two|without you.
{4891}{4963}To 20 years of you and me.
{5058}{5130}And to our children, safe at home.
{5322}{5370}Hey, cool, you lost them!
{5370}{5418}Put the Macho Mustang boys, to boot!
{5442}{5538}-We struck a blow for sisterhood!|-That's not the only "blow" you know, sis.
{5538}{5586}Diss.
{5586}{5658}-Any raves in this weekend?|-Full Moon Underground.
{5658}{5730}In San Bernardino.|Probably Saturday.
{5730}{5778}I'll tell my mom I'm staying over at your hourse, ok Tash?
{5802}{5874}I cannot believe you|can still work that old scam.
{5874}{5922}What can I say?|My 'rents are just adorably clueless.
{5993}{6041}So, I'll bring the glowsticks if somebody else buys the gas.
{6065}{6137}-That's such a good idea!|-Nice try, Beams.
{6161}{6209}Rest up, it's gonna be one hell of a weekend.
{6209}{6281}-Bye, Tasha.|-Don't let the bedbugs bite!
{6425}{6449}Hasta!
{6881}{6929}Now they call the cops on me.
{7144}{7192}Hello!
{7312}{7360}Hello!
{7384}{7432}I'm sorry I'm late.
{7456}{7480}Ruby Baker?
{7528}{7576}Yeah, I'm Ruby. And, hum...
{7648}{7744}You know, whatever they said,|I'm not missing. I just went out.
{7792}{7816}Your parents were in a car accident.
{7840}{7888}Are they okay?
{7912}{8007}-Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon?|-Are they okay?
{8007}{8079}My partner's gonna help you to have a seat.|Ruby.
{8103}{8127}-I can sit down myself.|-I understand.
{8151}{8175}I said "Are they okay?"
{8175}{8223}-Relax.|-Why won't you answer me?|-We're here to help you.
{8247}{8271}You'll gonna be okay.
{8295}{8343}Relax. Ruby?
{8439}{8463}Ruby!
{8487}{8511}You'll be okay.
{8511}{8583}-Get her pulse.|-Can you hear me, Ruby?
{8703}{8751}"They are as asleep.
{8751}{8823}In the morning, they're like grass|which groweth up.
{8847}{8919}In the morning, it flourisheth|and groweth up.
{8919}{9014}In the evening, it is cut down|and withereth...
{9014}{9110}...for we're consumed by thine anger|and by thy wrath are we troubled.
{9134}{9230}Thou has set our iniquities|before thee, our secret sins...
{9230}{9278}...in the light of thy countenance.
{9302}{9374}For all our days are|passed away in thy wrath.
{9398}{9446}We spend our years as|a tale that is told...
{9470}{9518}...so teach us to number our days...
{9518}{9614}...that we may apply|our hearts unto wisdom."
{9614}{9710}I think Rhett Baker wants to come up| and say something. Rhett?
{10141}{10165}I just--
{10237}{10285}I just wanna say....
{10525}{10549}I just....
{10573}{10597}It's okay.
{10765}{10837}I didn't work with Dave and Grace|or see them every day, but, mmm...
{10861}{10909}...I knew them both for 10 years...
{10909}{10981}...and I'm sure if they|could hear all this....
{11052}{11076}... well.... Grace...
{11100}{11172}...would do her dismissive|little giggle.
{11196}{11220}You know the one.
{11244}{11340}And Dave would mutter|an "expletive deleted."
{11436}{11508}They would just hate to be remembered|as anything but...
{11508}{11556}...ordinary.
{11604}{11652}Which is exactly what they were:
{11676}{11724}Anything but ordinary.
{11796}{11820}But they will live on...
{11844}{11940}...through their children|and in all our hearts.
{12083}{12107}Ruby?
{12155}{12179}Do you remember me?
{12203}{12275}I'm Uncle Jack,|your mom's brother.
{12275}{12323}I'll go wait by the car, okay?
{12419}{12491}Look... I just want you to know... If there's anything that you need...
{12491}{12539}...anything I can do...
{12539}{12659}...l don't mean in the next few weeks|or months, I mean anytime.
{12683}{12779}How come I haven't seen you|in, like, I don't know... 10 years?
{12803}{12851}Have you even met my brother Rhett?
{12875}{12899}Well, of course I have.
{12923}{12971}I haven't seen either of you in years, but...
{12994}{13066}First of all, I live pretty far away.|Chicago.
{13090}{13114}Then how are you gonna help us?
{13138}{13234}I don't know.|There's the phone, there's e-mail.
{13234}{13330}-You and my mom never did write each other, though.|-That's true.
{13354}{13426}Well, Ruby, as siblings get older,|they go separate ways.
{13426}{13498}-I know you and Rhett are close now--|-No, we're not.
{13522}{13570}Just counting the ending, we have nothing in common.
{13594}{13690}Used to feel that way about your mom.|It's not true.
{13714}{13810}You know, I used to think when things slow down,|I'd take a month off and come out here...
{13810}{13906}...and get to know you,|your brother and Grace again.
{13930}{14001}It was nice to see you again.|I'm sorry things didn't work out.
{14217}{14289}-I'll call you later, okay?|-Okay.
{14793}{14865}Ruby? Hi.
{14889}{14961}-I'm Alvin Begleiter.|-Hi.
{14984}{15032}I'm so sorry.
{15056}{15152}I'm your--|Was your parents' estate lawyer.
{15176}{15224}I helped them plan their wills...
{15224}{15320}...what it is that they wanted to do|with their money and--
{15368}{15488}Well, actually, the most important issue right now|is who's gonna be taking care of you.
{15488}{15536}You and Rhett.
{15536}{15608}I'm assuming that you know the Glasses, correct?
{15608}{15680}They were our nextdoor neighbours, so I've known them my whole life.
{15680}{15752}That's good. Cause I know that your parents...
{15752}{15848}...chose them after a great deal|of consideration.
{15848}{15896}You know, there's something else.
{15896}{15968}Your parents were extremely thrifty...
{15991}{16111}...and with your mom's share of the inheritance,|your dad's life insurance...
{16135}{16255}...there's more than enough for you|and Rhett for the rest of your lives.
{16279}{16327}Well, then obviously you don't know Rhett.
{16375}{16471}That's good. I like that.|I'm gonna give you one of my cards.
{16471}{16519}And I don't expect any trouble.
{16519}{16639}But if you have any concerns,|any problems....
{16639}{16735}I'm an estate lawyer,| but also what they call a trust lawyer.
{16735}{16831}And I wanna be someone you can trust.
{16951}{17022}-You call me, okay?|-Okay.
{17046}{17070}Mr. Glass.
{17190}{17238}-Ruby.|-Thank you.
{17286}{17358}My mom and dad would've|really loved that speech.
{17406}{17454}-They would've loved it.|-Come here.
{17550}{17646}That's good.|We're gonna get through this.
{17670}{17718}We'll get through it together, okay?
{17838}{17886}Oh, Ruby.
{17910}{17958}You're in good hands.
{18653}{18677}Hey!
{18701}{18821}-You guys are ready for Malibu?|-It'll be a big change, we won't lie.
{18821}{18869}But it's not the worst place, either.
{18869}{18988}-Cool. Is this your car?|-You're in there already?|-My company's, on loan for today.
{20139}{20187}Sweet!
{20235}{20283}This place is huge!
{20403}{20451}Hey, Rubes, check out this view.
{20475}{20523}Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
{20643}{20739}-Cool, a meteorite!|-It's art. It's art, Rhett.
{20763}{20859}Terry, you give them the grand tour.|Stall them, while I order some dinner.
{20859}{20907}Let's get the lay of the land.
{21050}{21098}Master suite.
{21122}{21146}Home gym.
{21218}{21266}-Home theater.|-Sweet.
{21290}{21338}-Looks like you never have to leave home.|-Oh, if only...
{21386}{21434}This is Vicky. She comes in most days.
{21434}{21482}-Hola, niños.|-Hola.
{21482}{21506}Hello!
{21578}{21626}This is your room.
{21650}{21722}It's temporary quarters, of course.
{21746}{21866}Unpack, get settled,|and I'll meet you in the kitchen.
{21938}{21985}We're sharing a room?
{22105}{22201}If you even glance at me when I'm changing|for bed, you're so busted.
{22225}{22321}Ok, we have a little calamari,|we have a little risotto with porterbed mushrooms...
{22369}{22441}...and a little green salad with|some Swiss chard.
{22609}{22705}-Do you have any, mmm, Garfield?|-What is that?
{22705}{22801}-It's crap in a can.|-If it's crap, how come you eat it?
{22801}{22921}-Come on, kids. Try the calamari.|-Isn't that squid?
{23040}{23136}-Honey, tonight....|-I'll call Domino's.
{23160}{23184}Thank you.
{23592}{23640}Oh, can you just turn and face the wall?
{23664}{23712}Who are you, the Blair Witch?
{23712}{23784}No, I'm worse. Can't you just face the goddam wall.
{23808}{23856}Turn that stupid thing off!
{25102}{25174}Honey, there's public school,| and then there's public school.
{25174}{25246}Trust me, there won't be any|Bloods or Creeps.
{25270}{25342}I'm not scared of getting gunned down.
{25342}{25414}-Ruby, you're a great kid--|-It's not about being great or not great,
{25438}{25486}-It's about being....|-New?
{25510}{25534}Middle-of-the-year new.
{25582}{25654}Look, there's a little saying we teach|the patients in the Pain Ward.
{25678}{25726}"This too shall pass."
{25750}{25846}This too shall pass.|This too shall pass.
{25918}{25942}Hi.
{25942}{26013}Why don't you just take|a seat in the back?
{26253}{26301}We have a new addition.
{26325}{26397}Would you introduce yourself,|Miss Baker?
{26445}{26469}You just did.
{26637}{26661}Hi.
{26709}{26757}I'm Ruby Baker.
{26829}{26925}I used to go to Shady Lane.|That's in the Valley.
{26949}{27020}It's not my choice,|just an accident of birth.
{27068}{27092}How come you moved here now?
{27140}{27188}It was another accident.
{27260}{27308}Let's all make Ruby feel welcome.
{27692}{27716}Thanks for the lift, Vicky.
{27812}{27836}Sweet!
{27956}{28003}I can't believe it!|I can't believe it!
{28003}{28075}Like one of those isn't noisy and obnoxious enough?
{28075}{28171}No, Rubes. Because, you can't play|"Pokémon Snap" on PlayStation.
{28195}{28267}You can play "Ape Escape,"|but you can't on N-64.
{28267}{28339}Mom and Dad would totally just freak out.
{28387}{28411}Don't talk about mom and dad.
{28963}{29034}I haven't even seen like one girl|with blue-black hair.
{29058}{29154}And all the guys spend all day surfing and swimming.|That old, bizarre, physical culture of sun-worshiping geeks.
{29154}{29202}That sounds fairly hot.
{29202}{29322}So, anyway... I was crazy checking my pager all day|cause I'd figured you'd call and you didn't.
{29322}{29418}I wanted to call you at lunch, but cell phones are banned at school.|And like the kids just don't care.
{29418}{29490}They can't see that|they've lost their civil liberties.
{29490}{29586}Probably 'cause they have so much|sunstroke... They're like permanently wasted.
{29586}{29610}Ruby?
{29730}{29802}I got us an assortment|of different things this time.
{29826}{29898}Some cold pasta, some salads...
{30017}{30137}Ruby, I really think that you'd be|well-served by a better attitude.
{30257}{30353}It's okay. I don't mind take-out.|I know that you guys are busy.
{30353}{30401}It's not like it's from Wendy's or anything...
{30401}{30497}I'm speaking about your attitude|toward your new school.
{30545}{30641}-My attitude?|-I overheard your conversation.
{30689}{30713}You were listening in on my call?
{30713}{30833}No, I was trying to get a line out,|but that's beside the point.
{30833}{30929}The point is, you need those|kids to like you.
{30929}{31000}Otherwise, you're just going to isolate yourself,|sabotage yourself.
{31000}{31096}-You're going to have a miserable time.|-Okay, I get it.
{31240}{31264}I learned something.
{31480}{31504}Ruby?
{31528}{31552}Ruby...
{31576}{31648}-Wake up.|-I'm awake.
{31696}{31768}-Wake up.|-Mommy?
{31840}{31864}Mommy?
{33566}{33614}My God, you just scared the crap out of me.
{33638}{33734}Well, I heard noises. I thought|it was a burglar or a coyote.
{33734}{33782}I'm not used to having kids in the house.
{33830}{33854}Come here.
{34021}{34045}Thank you.
{34309}{34333}You must be freezing.
{34381}{34501}No more 3 a.m. swims, ok?. With all|the glass, you can hear everything.
{34501}{34549}I'm gonna start setting the alarm at night.
{34573}{34621}Are you coming?
{34837}{34885}Drunk driving among California teens has...
{34885}{34980}...steadily decreasing,|but we can still do better.
{34980}{35028}As these images starkly attest...
{35052}{35124}...alcohol remains the No. 1|drug problem among young people today.
{35148}{35244}This year, more than 20 percent|of teenage drivers....
{35844}{35916}So? How was your first day|of Driver's Ed?
{35940}{36059}-Fine, I guess.|-They still show those gruesome movies?
{36059}{36107}Honey, those were the Dark Ages.
{36107}{36203}I'm sure they've got more|enlightened ways of teaching kids today, don't they?
{36203}{36227}May I be excused?
{36491}{36587}Stupid, kid-proof piece of crap.
{36635}{36659}Ruby?
{36731}{36851}Was it awful?|I mean, the driving class?
{36851}{36923}-I can just imagine.|-No, it's....
{37018}{37042}Well... I...I have my period.
{37138}{37186}Oh... Well... come with me.
{37498}{37522}Thank you.
{37762}{37810}Four out of five doctors recommend....
{37834}{37906}This cramp, too, shall pass.
{38001}{38073}I'll turn it off|just as soon as I get to a save point.
{38121}{38193}It's cool. I don't care.
{38241}{38289}It's kind of relaxing.
{38889}{38937}Erin, get out of there!
{38960}{39032}What were you doing in there?|Tell me the truth!
{39056}{39104}-What are you implying with that question?|-Tell me!
{39104}{39176}No, I'm not gonna answer you!|Good night!
{39176}{39272}-What the hell are you doing?|-Getting ready for bed. Im' tired.
{39272}{39368}-And watch your language. There's kids in the house.|-Don't play games with me, Erin.
{39368}{39440}You know exactly what I'm talking about.
{39440}{39536}I'm too tired to even guess what you are|talking about. I'm sick of your accusations.
{39536}{39584}Tired? Is that what you call it now?
{39608}{39656}-How many times have I asked you--|-I've done everything you've asked me--
{39656}{39680}You told me you--
{39991}{40015}Ruby?
{40015}{40087}-Hi, I'm Hannah.|-Hi.|-Hi.
{40135}{40231}So... There's this rumor you were|on academic probation at your school...
{40255}{40279}Cut to the chase, huh?
{40303}{40423}I was. And then I had sex with the dean of students|and he took it off my record.
{40447}{40471}Oh, not really.
{40495}{40567}I was supposed to be at|my friend Tasha's one Saturday night...
{40567}{40639}...doing an essay on and ulter conference,|and went to this rave instead.
{40639}{40759}Come Sunday, I was totally fried and|downloaded this thing off the net.
{40759}{40831}-Tuesday, I was busted.|-Hey, Hannah!
{40855}{40927}-Hey! I gotta go.|-Bye.
{41214}{41262}Hey, Ruby.
{41262}{41334}There's a premiere in Westwood,|and my company's driving a bunch of people...
{41358}{41430}I gotta stop by and make sure everything's|running smooth. You wanna come?
{41454}{41550}I have homework tonight, probably three more hours.|Pretty heavy, so....
{41574}{41598}That's perfect.
{41814}{41910}So, are we gonna catch the tail end of the movie|or go straight to the party?
{42101}{42149}Actually, the hell with Westwood.
{42149}{42269}-My drivers can handle a lousy premiere.|-Evening, sir.
{42269}{42341}Mud pie for the lady.|Ketel One, rocks, for me.
{42341}{42365}Great.
{42389}{42413}Thank you.
{42437}{42533}That party'd be a mob scene.|What I really want is talk to you.
{42557}{42605}-Here you are.|-Thank you.
{42629}{42749}I remember when you guys moved|down the block 11 years ago.
{42749}{42869}It was funny. I noticed the furniture|as they brought it in.
{42869}{42917}Erin noticed there was a little girl.
{42941}{43036}But you were upset.|I guess about moving cross-country.
{43084}{43108}You wouldn't say a word.
{43132}{43204}Just hugged this plastic doll|against your little chest.
{43228}{43324}Malibu Barbie, I think it was.|Prophetic, huh?
{43324}{43372}I think you mean "pathetic."
{43420}{43444}No, no.
{43564}{43660}-I guess you moved on years ago.|-From what?
{43684}{43756}From hugging plastic dolls.
{43852}{43900}I should hope so.
{44043}{44091}Last night, when you two were fighting...
{44115}{44163}...it had nothing to do with us, right?
{44163}{44259}No, no, no. Married people sometimes|like to...
{44259}{44331}...push each other's buttons. Just because they can.
{44331}{44451}It's another form of intimacy,|a lower form, but nothing serious.
{44475}{44523}There's one thing I haven't told you about Erin...
{44595}{44667}It can be lonely living with her.
{44787}{44883}But that's my cross to bear,|not yours.
{45050}{45098}I think it's past my bedtime, Terry.
{45146}{45170}Of course it is.
{45194}{45242}Let's get you to bed.
{46105}{46129}Terry...
{46201}{46273}You're not wearing|your shoulder belt.
{46825}{46849}Hey.
{46873}{46968}Try not to make too much noise.|I'm sure Rhett and Erin are asleep.
{46992}{47016}Okay?
{47904}{47975}Hamlet senses something's wrong...
{47975}{48047}...right under this nose,|that he alone can set right.
{48047}{48119}I want two pages next Friday...
{48119}{48215}...about what he means|and whether he succeeds.
{48599}{48671}Mr. Begleiter, before my parents, mmm--
{48719}{48815}They ever talked to you about|finding different guardians for Rhett and me?
{48839}{48935}Different from the Glasses? No.
{48935}{49030}-Well, I think that they wanted to.|-They talked about that with you?
{49030}{49126}No, but my parents weren't|nearly as friendly with them after they moved.
{49150}{49198}Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents.
{49198}{49246}They're never gonna be your parents.
{49270}{49390}-But if Erin or Terry has done anything--|-We sleep in one room, Rhett and me.
{49414}{49438}Well, that's not ideal.
{49438}{49534}And then, the other night we|were alone in Terry's car. And he--
{49558}{49630}What? What did he do?
{49630}{49678}He just put my seat belt on.
{49726}{49846}But the way that he leaned|across me, it wasn't-- It just-- And I felt....
{49894}{49942}I know it sounds stupid.
{49965}{49989}And then...
{49989}{50109}...I walked in and Erin was shooting up.|I saw her holding a needle.
{50109}{50157}Anyway, she looked really baked.
{50205}{50229}Ruby.
{50325}{50349}Ruby.
{50397}{50445}Try and understand this.
{50469}{50565}The accident, in effect...
{50565}{50613}...orphaned you and your brother.
{50637}{50733}So if this doesn't work out|with the Glasses...
{50733}{50781}...you've no place to go.
{50805}{50853}You're gonna become wards of the state.
{50901}{50948}And I'm not trying to scare you.
{50972}{51044}I'm just telling you the facts of life.
{51140}{51212}I drove halfway here from Malibu|with the housekeeper...
{51212}{51284}...and then I hitchhiked the rest of the way|and I was really scared...
{51284}{51380}But I kept telling myself once I made it,|you'd help me and Rhett.
{51668}{51740}When we met, you said|you were somebody I could trust.
{51860}{51884}Okay.
{51932}{51955}All right.
{52051}{52147}I believe you. And I know|who to get in touch with.
{52171}{52267}It's not gonna be easy.|I can't promise you any results.
{52315}{52435}But I can promise you that I'll look|into this. You have my word on that.
{52459}{52483}Thank you.
{52555}{52603}When we spoke after the funeral...
{52651}{52699}...you had said that...
{52723}{52771}...we had more than enough.
{52795}{52843}How much would that be exactly?
{52867}{52986}That's really a question for the|trust officer over at the L.A. Federal Bank.
{53010}{53106}But between us,|four million dollars.
{53178}{53250}So you can see,|you're financially very secure.
{53298}{53346}Yeah.
{53370}{53466}Now why don't you run on home.|And do me one more favor?
{53466}{53514}No hitchhiking.
{53538}{53634}-This is out, okay?|-Yes, sir.
{54089}{54137}Yeah. Alvin Begleiter calling.
{54209}{54305}I just had a really disturbing visit|from Ruby Baker.
{54473}{54545}Rhett, why don't you leave that now?
{54569}{54593}Go and do some homework.
{54617}{54665}I have a bunch of homework to do, too.
{54713}{54761}Stay a minute, would you?
{54809}{54905}What you walked in last night|isn't what you think.
{54905}{54976}Erin suffers from diabetes.
{55000}{55024}I've kept that private.
{55048}{55168}It's not something I wanna worry you or Rhett about.|The disease is under control.
{55168}{55288}So what you saw last night was Erin|giving herself her nightly insulin injection.
{55288}{55360}Must've been a shock to walk in on.
{55432}{55480}One more thing.
{55504}{55624}Terry tells me that you got a|little skittish with him last night.
{55696}{55816}That makes us feel sad.|We want you to trust us, Ruby.
{55816}{55864}We need your trust.
{55912}{55983}I know I overreacted, I'm sorry.
{55983}{56079}There're still some things|I need to get used to around here.
{56079}{56127}We all do.
{56151}{56199}We're all under stress.
{56295}{56343}I'm gonna go begin my Hamlet paper.
{56391}{56439}Hey, if you need any help,|let me know.
{56511}{56559}That'd be great.
{56751}{56895}That's fine. Now you're gonna|put the car in park and step out.
{56895}{56966}And, Ruby? You're gonna get|behind the wheel next.
{57134}{57206}You can apply a little more gas, Ruby.
{57374}{57446}I'm sorry, I'm really a bad driver.
{57446}{57518}There aren't any bad drivers,|just inexperienced ones.
{57518}{57590}Now take a breath Ruby, let's start driving back again.
{57806}{57830}Bye.
{58309}{58369}No, Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry.|He's not in right now.
{58369}{58429}But I'll have him call you back|as soon as he can.
{58453}{58501}Hi.
{58501}{58597}-I'm Ruby Baker. I'm Terry's--|-I know who you are, Ruby.
{58621}{58669}Okay. Cool.
{58693}{58741}I stopped by to catch a ride home|from Terry when he's ready.
{58765}{58837}He's having a powwow with|some people right now.
{58837}{58933}-But if you wanna wait, there's a really|nice lounge behind me.|-Okay, thank you.
{58956}{59052}-Glass Transit, how may I help you?|-Any available service technician, please come to the office.
{59268}{59340}-So, what's going on, Terry?|-Oh, the usual.
{59364}{59436}But not to worry, fellows.|It's nothing that can't be handled.
{59460}{59580}-Mr. Glass, we had a payment plan.|-The dates arrive, the money doesn't.
{59580}{59676}About that payment plan.|Nicole had a day...
{59676}{59724}...I'd had to call it... unrealistic.
{59724}{59796}-You proposed that plan.|-Yeah, I know.
{59796}{59892}-It's not dishonesty. We gotta--|-What is it?
{59892}{59939}Naive optimism.
{59987}{60035}But then again, I'm an optimist by nature.
{60083}{60131}I'm betting on myself.
{60203}{60227}I'll be right with you.
{60659}{60755}-Where's the money we loaned you, Mr. Glass.?|-You're not listening. The money--
{60803}{60875}-Say "is", as in, "the money is."|-Yeah.
{61618}{61642}Can I help you?
{61666}{61762}-Whose car is this?|-Hell if I know. Just showed up one day.
{61762}{61858}-One day, when?|-I don't know. A few months ago?
{61882}{61977}-We had a car kinda like this.|-You know, you really shouldn't be back here.
{62001}{62025}Ruby?
{62073}{62097}Ruby?
{62145}{62241}What happened before was nothing.|Just a business glitch.
{62289}{62385}Hope you didn't get freaked.|People get very weird about money.
{62433}{62553}I didn't mean to just show up like that, you know?|I waited for Vicky and she never came.
{62577}{62673}We had to let Vicky go.|Erin was coming, but she got held up at the hospital.
{62673}{62769}-Wait. Back up. You had to let Vicky go?|-Yeah, we had to.
{62769}{62841}She drove you somewhere|without anyone's permission.
{62841}{62913}Just to Santa Monica,to the Promenade,|to hang out with some kids.
{62984}{63032}How did you know that she drove me?
{63032}{63152}How did we know? It's our job to know.
{63896}{63991}-Did you have a hard day at work, Erin?|-It was fine really, thank you.
{65190}{65238}Hamlet.
{65262}{65334}Don't you hate how he can't|make up his mind?
{65382}{65502}To be, not be, not not be,|be, be not.
{66533}{66581}My father drove a Saab.
{69314}{69338}Terry!
{69410}{69434}Thank you.
{69482}{69530}For finishing my paper.
{69578}{69626}That would be wrong.
{69961}{70009}-Ruby.|-Yeah?
{70009}{70057}Would you mind coming with me?
{70105}{70129}Sure.
{70393}{70465}Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan.
{70465}{70537}I'm an inspector with the Department of Social Services.
{70729}{70849}Your estate lawyer let us know that you may|have problems with your guardians, is that right?
{70921}{71016}Ruby, please relax and be open with me.|Everything said here stays private.
{71040}{71088}Okay? So...
{71112}{71136}...you're 16...
{71160}{71256}...and your brother is 11,|and you are currently sharing a bedroom?
{71256}{71304}Yeah, for now.
{71352}{71496}And you saw Erin Glass|injecting herself?
{71496}{71616}-They said she has diabetes.|-Diabetes? I'm gonna double check that.
{71664}{71736}You're writing down everything I say,|so now it's gonna be in writing twice.
{71760}{71839}My word's still not gonna count for shit|next to Terry Glass and Doctor Glass, right?
{71832}{71951}Which is why, when we're done, I'm gonna phone the Glasses|and ask them to meet me at their home...
{71951}{71999}...so I can verify everything with my own eyes.
{71999}{72071}-Okay?|-But...
{72071}{72119}...then how am I gonna live with them if they know that I told on them?
{72167}{72263}-Do you wanna live with them?|-Well, sometimes things are fine.
{72287}{72359}Last night, Terry helped me|with something...
{72359}{72431}...but maybe that was|to keep me happy, keep my mouth shut.
{72455}{72551}I know this is scary for you,|but you don't have to worry.
{72551}{72671}In a situation like this, we tell the guardians|that we are performing a routine sight inspection.
{72671}{72743}If it's still in progress when you get home...
{72743}{72839}...you just act like we've|never met or spoken.
{72863}{72958}You have no idea why I'm there. Okay?
{73246}{73294}Mrs. Ryan, this is my husband, Terry Glass.
{73294}{73342}-Hello.|-Hello.
{73342}{73438}Is this really necessary in the middle|of a business day?
{73438}{73510}We're gonna get this done|as quickly as possible, Mr. Glass.
{73510}{73582}Feels like an intrusion.|Let's get it over with.
{73774}{73822}-May l...?|-Of course.
{74181}{74253}It looks like only one child sleeps in here.
{74253}{74301}Yes, Rhett.
{74301}{74373}Rhett, yes. And the girl, Ruby,|she has her own room?
{74373}{74445}-Of course.|-She's 16.
{74709}{74757}Nice accommodations.
{74877}{74948}I think the kids are home.|Would you like to meet them?
{74948}{75020}Yes, I would. Just to say hi.
{75044}{75116}Oh, but first, Dr. Glass,|may I look upstairs?
{75260}{75332}I know this is awkward,|but it's also important.
{75356}{75428}It's a matter of child safety,|just ensuring there's nothing...
{75428}{75476}...dangerous in easy reach of an eleven-years old.
{75955}{76075}-"Humulin L and U."|-Diabetes. I'm type 1, insulin-dependent.
{76099}{76171}We have it totally under control.
{76219}{76267}It would appear that you do.
{76339}{76387}Here's the two best kids in the world.
{76435}{76507}Hi, you must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan.
{76507}{76555}Nice to meet you.
{76555}{76651}So Rhett, how do you spend|your evenings?
{76651}{76723}When I finish my homework, I read.
{76843}{76962}And you must be Ruby.|You have a very nice room.
{77058}{77130}Sorry for the inconvenience. You've made|a wonderful home for these children.
{77154}{77202}-Thank you, Dr. Glass.|-Thank you.
{77298}{77346}- Oh, thank you.|We'll see you out.
{77370}{77466}You read? You lie.
{77490}{77514}Guess who I learned from?
{78329}{78353}Bye now.
{68301}{79120}Why don't we order some dinner, hon?
{79456}{79504}So, how do you like your new room?
{79552}{79600}Couldn't have come at a better time.
{80199}{80247}Come on, Mr. Begleiter.
{80775}{80871}-Hello?|-So sorry to disturb at your home at this late hour.
{80871}{80966}But I found myself wide awake, wondering...|"Where's the money?"
{81110}{81134}You might as well know.
{81158}{81254}Six months ago I took on a partner.|A silent partner and...
{81278}{81374}...lt just recently came to my attention that|the little son of a bitch was skimming cash.
{81398}{81494}You've lost me. What does| all this have to do with our little loan?
{81542}{81590}I'm waiting, Mr. Glass.
{81614}{81710}-Mr. Glass, you still there?|-Yeah.
{81758}{81830}He was charging all those personal|expenses to the company.
{81854}{81949}Guess what Terry. Whenever I want to hear|a heartbreaking, human-interest story...
{81949}{82021}...I can watch the local news.
{82021}{82141}Meanwhile, your next payment's due|tomorrow, close of business.
{82141}{82189}Do you fully understand me, Mr. Glass?
{82333}{82381}Mr. Glass?
{82405}{82453}Yeah, I'm here.
{82477}{82573}And, I'm seeking full restitution|from my silent partner.
{82573}{82645}Plus I found a whole new|source of equity.
{82645}{82693}My big, new, personal piggy bank.
{82717}{82765}So you can expect another $30,000 for you, right off the badge.
{82789}{82885}That barely covers the interest.|You need to start paying off the principal, my friend.
{82885}{83004}Of course. The point is that I need some|more time. Not a lot more time.
{83004}{83028}A week at the most.
{83028}{83124}A week at the most? We'll give you two days,|as a favour, because we like you.
{83148}{83244}And because we'd hate for you to come home|tomorrow night, and find your beautiful house burnt down...
{83268}{83316}...with your wife inside.
{84155}{84179}Yeah?
{84323}{84419}"I could a tale unfold,|whose light as word would harrow up thy soul...
{84419}{84467}...freeze thy young blood...
{84467}{84563}...make thy two eyes|like stars, stars from their spheres...
{84563}{84635}...and each particular hair to stand in end.
{84635}{84683}If thou didst thy dear father love...
{84683}{84803}...revenge his foul and most unnatural|murder. Murder most foul...
{84827}{84922}But this most foul,|strange, and unnatural...."
{85066}{85090}Begleiter, Tamper and Brice.
{85090}{85210}-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter, please.|-One moment, please.
{85282}{85378}-Hello Ruby. Did you get my e-mail?|-No, 'cause Terry trashed my AOL account.
{85402}{85474}Or maybe the bill just didn't get paid in the confussion of your move.
{85498}{85546}Wherever. Did you find out about the BMW?
{85546}{85618}Right, the BMW.
{85618}{85690}It was registered|to a business: G.T.I.
{85690}{85762}Glass Transit Incorporated.
{85762}{85834}-Terry's company.|-So, now don't you get it?
{85882}{85929}Ruby, please come with me.
{86001}{86073}I think I have to call you back later.|Bye-bye.
{86121}{86193}This is Miss Bassett,|our vice principal.
{86217}{86241}Ruby.
{86265}{86361}The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,|that was your work, nobody helped?
{86385}{86457}-No.|-Not even Harold Bloom?
{86481}{86577}The phrase "Hamlet's dance of contraries,"|didn't sound like one of my students.
{86577}{86649}I found it and other sentences and phrases|in Mr. Bloom's recent book:
{86649}{86721}Shakespeare:|The Invention of the Human.
{86721}{86841}We were told there's a case of|plagiarism on your school record.
{86841}{86936}Do you understand why we have to take|decisive action in a situation like this?
{86936}{86984}You were told?
{87008}{87080}-By who?|-That is hardly the issue here, young lady.
{87080}{87176}This sort of cheating|has to have real consequences.
{87176}{87224}We've already spoken to your guardians.
{87272}{87296}Of course you have.
{87320}{87416}And frankly, we're not sure whether|you can continue at this school.
{87728}{87752}Well?
{87776}{87800}Why don't you ask Terry?
{87872}{87967}Or maybe it's time you started taking|some personal responsibility, Ruby.
{88015}{88063}Yeah, maybe it's time.
{89118}{89190}Hi. You've reached Jack Avery.|I'm out of the country...
{89190}{89262}...but I'll be checking my machine|ocasionally, so leave a message--
{91276}{91324}Rhett, come here.|Wake up.
{91420}{91492}Don't make a sound, ok?|I'm gonna get you dressed. We're gonna go.
{91492}{91564}-Where? With who?|-Away with me.
{91588}{91708}-Hey! Quit it! You're looking!|-Right. Like there's something to see.
{91708}{91804}It's raining. I was sleeping.|I don't wanna go.
{91804}{91828}Yes, you do. It's gonna be really fun.
{91900}{91995}They're giving away|free Dragon Ball Z tapes at Blockbuster.
{91995}{92043}We can go there really early|and avoid the rush.
{92091}{92139}Really?
{92475}{92499}Close the door.
{92739}{92787}What if they find out?
{92835}{92883}I'll take the blame, ok?.|Just get in the car.
{93266}{93314}You don't know what you're doing, uh?
{93770}{93794}Wanna slow down a little?
{93818}{93890}One thing I learned from Terry:|Buckle up.
{94369}{94441}-Terry's gonna kill you!|-Yeah, maybe so.
{94657}{94705}Turn that off.
{94729}{94753}Turn that shit off!
{94897}{94920}Look out!
{95088}{95136}You almost creamed that guy!
{95160}{95208}That's right.|Now turn it off!
{95568}{95616}-I wanna go back.|-We're not going back
{95616}{95688}-What do you mean we're not going back?|-What I said, genius. Figure it out.
{95688}{95784}We have to go back! You tricked me into this|and now I'm gonna get in trouble.
{95808}{95856}-No, they tricked you. The Glasses.|-What do you mean?
{95856}{95927}They did not. They're sleeping.
{96311}{96435}What I mean is that they were gonna send me away to the middle|of goddam nowhere so that I wouldn't give them|more trouble, and you'd just stay home with Terry and Erin.
{96435}{96503}I like Terry. I like Erin.
{96503}{96575}No, you like the shiny shit they blinded you with|so that you couldn't see what was right under your nose.
{96599}{96647}They made you lie to that social worker.|She could've helped us.
{96647}{96719}I didn't know that she was|a social worker, ok?
{96719}{96791}You didn't wanna be separated|from your beloved Nintendo.
{96839}{96910}They bought you off.
{96934}{97030}-Where are you taking us?|-I don't know yet. The point was just to get away.
{97150}{97174}Crap.
{97486}{97534}Just don't say anything stupid.
{97630}{97678}The highway is closed from here to Sunset.
{97678}{97774}There's a mudslide.|You're gonna have to use Malibu Canyon....
{97894}{97965}-Can I see your driver's license, please?|-My driver's license?
{97965}{98061}-And your registration too, please.|-It's....
{98085}{98157}It's over there in all my stuff.
{98229}{98301}I think I saw it over here.
{98373}{98445}I'm gonna have to ask you to pull unto|the shoulder and step out of the car, please
{98613}{98637}Officer!
{98709}{98757}These are my kids.
{98781}{98805}Terry Glass, Glass Transit.
{98829}{98900}-The limos we loaned you for last year's parade.|-Oh, yeah. How are you?
{98972}{99020}Rhett, you poor baby! Come on with me.
{99020}{99092}We have a little behavior problem|back at the old homestead.
{99092}{99188}Your sister's going through|a hard time right now, sweetheart.
{99188}{99284}-You know, teenage-girl stuff.|-Got you.
{99308}{99332}Good luck.
{99572}{99620}Move over, hon.
{99668}{99716}-You can turn around right here.|-Thanks.
{100171}{100195}Don't you have anything to say to me?
{100291}{100339}You killed my parents.
{100387}{100435}That's just not insane,|it's hurtful.
{100459}{100579}You're obviously threatened by your|business associates. I saw it.
{100579}{100651}Like Erin said to me the other day,|"We need your trust, Ruby."
{100651}{100723}You need my trust for sure,|$4 million dollars' worth.
{100723}{100819}I got a thriving business.|My wife's a successful doctor.
{100819}{100867}-I got a big, new--|-"Personal Piggy bank."
{100962}{101034}That's just words out of context.|Just words.
{101034}{101130}-What about your BMW my dad was driving that night?|-What about it?!
{101202}{101274}For your parent's anniversary,|I lent them a Beemer...
{101298}{101346}...so Dave wouldn't have to drive Grace|in that dingy old Saab...
{101370}{101418}...which I hammered out and repainted.
{101418}{101466}No good deed goes unpunished, ah?
{101466}{101562}'Cause in your trashy teenage mind,|you twisted that into--
{101562}{101682}What do you think? I what..? Cut the steering,|stripped the brakes?
{101682}{101706}Yeah.
{101730}{101778}It's understandable,|it's basic psychology.
{101802}{101874}'Cause you don't wanna blame|your dad for what happened.
{101874}{101945}The fact that he had too much booze in him|that night.
{101945}{101993}Then you'd have to ask yourself|why your mom and dad...
{102017}{102113}...weighted the bottle so hard.|Whose behavior had driven them to drink?
{102569}{102617}Get this straight, Ruby.
{102641}{102713}You and Rhett are mine.
{103048}{103144}And now I suggest you forget your lurid,|female adolescent fantasies and start--
{103288}{103312}Help! Help!
{103360}{103432}-Let me go, you bastard!|-Calm down, little girl!
{103600}{103648}What's happening out there?
{103648}{103720}Your sister is having a tantrum, honey.
{103720}{103792}Come on. Come back to bed.
{103840}{103888}Let me go! Get off!
{103935}{103959}Let go!
{104055}{104079}You...!
{104247}{104295}Listen hard, Ruby.
{104295}{104367}Anything happens to you,|we got Rhett for seven more years...
{104367}{104439}...and all we need is one surviving child.
{104439}{104559}Erin! Stop him, please!
{104559}{104583}Erin!
{104655}{104751}Please come help me, please!|He's not gonna hurt you, I promise--
{104799}{104871}Erin, please don't! Erin, don't! No!
{105038}{105086}Thank you for being such a good listener.
{105134}{105254}You'll feel better now, Ruby.|Rest, relax.
{105710}{105758}-Now, where to, ladies?|-I vote the mall.
{105758}{105806}Hey, wait. Time-out.|Has anyone heard from Ruby?
{105830}{105925}-Me? Not for a month.|-Same. Won't even answer my e-mails.
{105925}{106021}What up with Little Miss Malibu?|Too busy bodysurfing for her old gal' pals?
{106045}{106093}Well... Then we are too busy for her.
{106309}{106405}-Hello?|-Where's the rest of our money, Mr. Glass?
{106429}{106501}You're just not gonna believe this. The bank mailed me|a check, but with the wrong zip code.
{106525}{106621}Some incompetent jerk at the bank|inverted the last two digits!
{106621}{106669}So, basically, I'll need another--
{106861}{106932}We gotta expand the house,|a wing for the kids.
{106932}{107052}Our little boy's getting bigger and bigger every day,|and, of course, the girl is a teen.
{107076}{107124}I don't know if you've got any kids of your own...
{107172}{107292}Anyway, construction costs|in Malibu are off the charts.
{107316}{107364}I'm estimating a quarter million, minimum.
{107388}{107508}We'll need to see blueprints, Mr. Glass.|There's an approval process...
{107508}{107580}Well, you can't get blueprints|without an architect.
{107580}{107676}And my architect is looking for a cash down payment.|He's in demand.
{107700}{107772}I believe we advanced you...
{107796}{107891}...$30,000 for that purpose|just last month.
{107891}{108011}But that was for a room,|before I realized I needed a wing.
{108011}{108107}And isn't it a general principle of the guardianship|to keep the kids comfortable?
{108155}{108179}Here's the trust document.
{108203}{108275}It authorizes me to use trust money|to enlarge the house.
{108299}{108395}And isn't it also a general principle that|the guardians aren't supposed to suffer economically...
{108395}{108515}...in the fullfillment of their obligations?|I'm paying two tuitions at the Westcott School...
{108515}{108635}I'm employing a fulltime nanny.|These kids are seeing top therapists to help them deal with the tragedy.
{108635}{108731}I'm planning family trips|to broaden their horizons...
{108731}{108827}... and it's like a root canal|every time I need a reimbursement.
{108994}{109090}-Where'd you get that?|-I thought you faxed it to us last week.
{109090}{109210}Which is why I'm surprised to hear you say| you have both children enrolled at Westcott.
{109282}{109402}Did I say Westcott? We changed our minds|about Westcott. It's too... too glitzy.
{109426}{109546}-Listen. We gotta do what's best for the children.|-Isn't that the truth?
{109570}{109642}Thank you for waiting, Doctor.|I can take your order now.
{109642}{109738}Yes. I need five dozen|10cc syringes Fentanyl...
{109738}{109810}...and I need two dozen|20cc syringes Demerol.
{109834}{109882}We sent up 60 of Fentanyl on Monday, Doctor...
{109905}{110001}Yes, but as I noted in the chart, I had to double the PCA infusion|rate of Demerol in six patients.
{110001}{110049}Dr. Glass?
{110049}{110121}Diedre, I'll be right with you.|I'm on the phone with the pharmacy.
{110121}{110169}Dr. Wise wants to see you in his office.
{110193}{110241}The Medical Director.
{110721}{110769}Wake up, Ruby.
{110793}{110841}Sleeping Beauty.
{111080}{111176}All you do is sleep. It scares me.
{111272}{111368}So you're losing your medical license.|That's wonderful.
{111392}{111512}-I have a sickness.|-Yeah, it's called self-pity.
{111536}{111632}Complicated by being born|without a freaking backbone.
{111632}{111680}So I'm weak, am l?
{111704}{111728}Maybe I am.
{111752}{111824}At least I'm not hopelessly greedy|and reckless...
{111824}{111895}...borrowing a million dollars|from some loan sharks--
{111895}{112015}Which should've been paid off by now!|We had a good thing going...
{112015}{112063}...till you stuck your hand in the cookie jar.
{112063}{112135}A good thing? You son of a bitch!
{112135}{112231}-I was a doctor!|-Yeah, but you turned yourself into a junkie.
{112255}{112351}Not until you did what you did.
{112351}{112399}Where were you when I did it?
{112495}{112615}Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.
{112615}{112687}I saw an opportunity and I grabbed it.
{112687}{112807}'Cause I had what you didn't.|I had the nerve, the will.
{112807}{112879}Since nobody was giving me a second chance,| I just took it.
{112879}{112950}I'm not doing this anymore.
{113022}{113070}It's already done.
{113070}{113166}What this is about is containing the damage.|You understand?
{113238}{113262}Good.
{113310}{113382}You know we're gonna have|to get rid of the girl.
{113406}{113454}Speaking of which, we're dry|aren't we?
{113478}{113598}We've got nothing to take care of Ruby with, so...|I guess I'll have to go out and get something.
{113646}{113694}And if I can't find drugs in L.A....
{114557}{114581}Hi!
{114629}{114701}Wave at the camera, Ruby.|Wave at the camera!
{114701}{114749}They can't catch me!
{114773}{114869}-Come in the water, Erin!|-Wait for me! I'm coming too!
{115084}{115180}Spin me, Erin! Faster!|-Good girl.
{116595}{116667}Rhett. Rhett, move away.
{117194}{117266}Erin! It took some doing...
{117290}{117362}...but finally I found some|pharmaceutical morphine.
{117434}{117458}Erin?
{118009}{118057}God, not now.
{118129}{118153}Erin?
{118201}{118225}Erin?
{118321}{118393}1875 Montego Canyon.
{118417}{118465}I thought you'd wanna know.
{118657}{118681}Ruby?
{118777}{118801}Honey?
{118992}{119064}Terry needs to sit down|and talk to you kids.
{121390}{121438}You kids are a handful,|you know that?
{121462}{121558}Where's your sister?|Where's your damn sister?
{121893}{121941}This is where I should've put you from day one.
{123596}{123620}What's happening?
{123860}{123883}He just pulled out the Jag.
{124267}{124339}-He just walked back in the house.|-Ok, you just keep working.
{125082}{125106}He's sleeping.
{125274}{125370}He fell asleep.|There's gonna be a change of plans, ok?
{126904}{126952}Why would he do that?
{126976}{127000}He's bombed!
{127000}{127096}He just finished up a bottle of vodka.|Look, it's right there, on the floor.
{127192}{127216}I think I see what's really weird in front of me.
{127696}{127744}Begleiter! What's going on?
{127744}{127840}Mr. Glass. You ought to have|your wife take a look at that.
{127864}{127959}-She's not at home.|-You know, I called your office and they said that you'd be at home.
{127959}{128055}I kept calling but nobody answered,|so here I am.
{128079}{128175}The bank has blocked your|guardianship account...
{128175}{128271}...pending an investigation. The trust officer...|he believes there's malfeasance.
{128271}{128319}The sons of bitches!
{128319}{128367}Mr. Glass. I went out on a hell of a limb for you.
{128391}{128463}I warned you about the girl's claims...
{128463}{128559}...about her e-mials, about her accusations,|because I trusted you, and the Bakers trusted you.
{128583}{128655}But if you've been lying,|then the courts are gonna step in.
{128655}{128751}And if these children are taken from you,|they have no place to go.
{128823}{128870}He thought he was helping us.
{129230}{129302}Mr. Glass, where are the children?
{129350}{129422}At their music lessons.|Their piano lessons.
{129422}{129494}You just watch. Next, I'll have to buy|them a Steinway...
{129494}{129590}...and the cheese bastards at the bank will say,|"Can't they learn to play the kazoo?"
{129758}{129782}Shit!
{129854}{129901}That's my Testarossa.
{129901}{129997}No, that's our Testarossa. You see,|until we get our money back, it's our Testarossa, Terry.
{129997}{130069}So, you've planned to skip town this morning?|Leave us in the wedge, buddy boy?
{130069}{130117}That' nuts!|Where'd you get an idea like that?
{130117}{130213}-Your wife was kind enough to call us this morning and gave us a little heads up.|-My wife?
{130285}{130405}So, before you leave town, how about repaying|the entire loan in one lump cash sum?
{130405}{130453}The son of a bitch doesn't have our money.
{130477}{130525}-What's going on, Terry?|-Ask him.
{130549}{130621}-Your silent partner?|-The bastard robbed me blind.
{130669}{130741}-Oh, my God. I'm leaving.|-No, no, no.
{130765}{130789}-You're not going anywhere.|-Really?
{130813}{130861}Yeah. I think we're entitled to an explanation.|-From me?
{130884}{130908}I have absolutely nothing to do with this!
{131316}{131388}-Nobody listens anymore.|-Are you happy, Terry?
{131412}{131484}Feel good about that?|Damned, Terry, you're a troublemaker.
{131508}{131628}-I guess that took care of the problem.|-No, no. Come on. We're gonna discuss this in the car.
{131652}{131676}There's nothing to discuss!
{131724}{131796}Look, Terry, just walk like a man out to the Jag, alright?
{131796}{131844}That was the whole problem.|You dealt with it.
{131867}{131939}The rest is pure profit.
{131963}{131987}Just not the Jag, okay?|The Volvo.
{132059}{132107}Wait here for a minute, okay?
{132227}{132323}-Nice little drive in our car.|-No! Not in there!
{132323}{132395}No. Not in there!|No! Not in there!
{132419}{132467}I don't even have the key to the damned car!
{132467}{132515}Don't sweat it Terry.|We've got all the keys to all the cars.
{132539}{132563}Take the Volvo, not the Jag!
{132587}{132659}-Let's go!|-Okay, you win!
{132683}{132731}-You win. You win.|It's over, okay?
{132731}{132803}Just please take the Volvo, okay?
{132803}{132851}You're making this difficult, Terry.
{132851}{132898}-Whatever.|-Take the Volvo.
{132898}{132970}Brand loyalty. I like that, Terry.
{133234}{133282}Oh, that little bitch!
{133282}{133354}You're some kind of joker.|We're gonna take the Jaguar.
{133378}{133402}No!
{134817}{134888}Hey! You haven't beento our Tarzana office,|have you, Mr. Glass?
{134912}{134960}We got a handball court and a sauna...
{134960}{135056}...and way in the back we have|this special room.
{135104}{135128}Totally soundproof.
{135488}{135512}What the--?
{135752}{135776}What the--?
{136926}{137022}What'd you do to this car?!|What'd you do to this car?!
{138173}{138245}Hi, you guys need some help?
{138293}{138317}Yes.
{138988}{139060}-You've got everything under control?|-Yeah, we've got it covered.
{139540}{139564}Terry?
{139660}{139732}You two kids stay in the car.
{139756}{139852}50110, I have a possible T.C. over the side|of Southbound, Malibu Canyon.
{139852}{139923}-I'll be out, investigating.|-Copy that.
{141026}{141074}50110, I have a rollover T.C...
{141074}{141170}...with one fatality.|I'm gonna need two backup units. 10-4.
{141290}{141338}Ruby.
{141650}{141674}It's okay.
{141698}{141770}Ruby, go! Drive!
{141818}{141913}-Where's the stupid key?!|-It's okay!
{141913}{142009}We're gonna die here! Let's go!|Come on, find them!
{142057}{142081}Ruby!
{142129}{142153}I need your help.
{142177}{142225}-He's getting closer, Ruby!|-I got them!
{142225}{142273}He's getting closer!
{142321}{142369}Drive! Drive! Drive!
{142489}{142537}Why are you stopping?!|Get us out of here!
{142657}{142681}It's okay, honey.
{142705}{142753}-Buckle up.|-What're you doing?!|-Bucke up!
{142801}{142872}-It's all forgiven.|-Ruby, what're you doing?
{143951}{144047}You kids okay?|Go back and wait by my car.
{145102}{145174}Things will get easier from here on.
{145222}{145246}They already have.
{145318}{145342}Let's go home.
