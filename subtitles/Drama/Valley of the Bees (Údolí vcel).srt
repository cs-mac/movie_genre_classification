1
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:07,402
<i>Deborah?</i>

2
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,528
- Where you been?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, T.

3
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,538
- Are you cheating on me?
- No, no! I'm not cheating on you.

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,131
- What...
- Stop it! What are you doing?

5
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:16,234
- T! Stop it!
- You ain't leaving me!

6
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:19,280
- Who is it?
- Nobody! It's you! I hate you!

7
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,407
T. Ray, just let me go!

8
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:25,544
<i>No!</i>

9
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:28,179
<i>T. Ray, damn it! Get off me!</i>

10
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,917
Lily!

11
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,267
<i>I killed my mother when I was four years old.</i>

12
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,066
<i>That's what I knew about myself.</i>

13
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:47,040
<i>She was all I wanted,
and I took her away.</i>

14
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:50,244
<i>Nothin'else much mattered.</i>

15
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,127
- T. Ray!
- What?

16
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,390
There's bees in my room!
Hundreds of'em! You've gotta see!

17
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:44,989
- What is it? Jesus Christ, Lily.
- They're in my room! Come see.

18
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,068
What?

19
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:00,047
Goddamn it, Lily.
This ain't funny.

20
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,549
But they were here.
They were flyin' everywhere.

21
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,017
You wake me again,
I'm gonna get out the grits.

22
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,088
You hear me?

23
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,926
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

24
00:03:24,406 --> 00:03:26,966
<i>The bees came the summer of'64...</i>

25
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:31,945
<i>The summer I turned 14 and my whole life
went spinnin'off into a whole new orbit.</i>

26
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:35,847
<i>Lookin'back on it,
I wanna say they were sent to me.</i>

27
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:40,411
<i>I wanna say they showed up like
the Angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary.</i>

28
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:42,786
<i>I know it's forward to compare
my small life to hers...</i>

29
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:48,186
<i>but I have good reason
to believe she wouldn't mind.</i>

30
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:19,785
So, um, my birthday is tomorrow.

31
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,793
Most girls want...

32
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:29,929
one of them little silver charm bracelets
they have down at the mercantile.

33
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,635
Think I'm the only girl in junior high
doesn't have one.

34
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:40,841
But I was just thinking you could tell me
about my mother instead.

35
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:44,853
<i>All you ever said is she's from Virginia
and she's an only child like I am.</i>

36
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,185
<i>I don't even know what
her favorite food was...</i>

37
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,919
<i>and what she liked
to do and... nothin;</i>

38
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:02,396
- You wanna know about your mama?
- Yeah.

39
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,476
Mm-hmm.

40
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,602
She used to spend hours
lurin' roaches and whatnot...

41
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:12,409
out of the house with graham crackers
and marshmallows.

42
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,112
Swear to God.

43
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:24,216
She was a lunatic about savin' bugs.

44
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:40,503
Here you go.

45
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,872
<i>Hey, Lily! Nice ass!</i>

46
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:56,952
Oh!

47
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:07,796
Gotcha.

48
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:14,497
Rosaleen.
Look at this thing fight.

49
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:17,629
- What you doin' with that?
- Catching bees to show T. Ray.

50
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,640
He thinks I'm making it up.

51
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,404
Get yourself stung,
don't come cryin' to me.

52
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:25,674
- Come fix this.
- For the future...

53
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:28,944
- What'd they do? Drop the atom bomb or somethin'?
- Hush.

54
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:33,249
It does say that there are those
who are equal before God...

55
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:36,654
shall now also be equal
in the polling booths...

56
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,091
in the classrooms,
in the factories...

57
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:42,494
- and in hotels and restaurants and movie theaters...
- Holy shit.

58
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,532
And other places that provide
service to the public.

59
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:47,158
Today, July the 2nd, 1964...

60
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:49,897
PresidentJohnson signed
the Civil Rights bill into law.

61
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:12,460
Fifteen, 16, 17, 18...

62
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,689
19, 20, 21, 22.

63
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:34,071
<i>When's my hair gonna
look like yours?</i>

64
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,872
I bet mine used to drive you crazy the way
it goes off in 11 wrong directions.

65
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:45,451
I bet you used to brush it a hundred times a day
just to get it to lay down.

66
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,058
I bet you did.

67
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:55,085
<i>Lily!</i>

68
00:08:55,197 --> 00:08:57,165
<i>Lily!</i>

69
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,802
<i>Lily!</i>

70
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,138
- Who you out here with?
- What?

71
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:11,805
- Who's out there?
- Nobody. There's no one here but me. It's just me.

72
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,848
Get up from there.

73
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,554
Get in here.

74
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:25,821
No! You think you're grown? Huh?

75
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,021
Out there doing God knows what.

76
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,363
You'll get yourself pregnant
and then what? Huh?

77
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:35,494
Huh?

78
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,503
You can go.

79
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:55,082
Mornin'.

80
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,812
How long your dad
keep you on these grits?

81
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,888
Hour.

82
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,950
Look at ya.

83
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,557
Happy birthday.

84
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,767
I didn't know you made me a cake.

85
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,803
Of course I did.
It's your birthday.

86
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:18,134
- How big a piece you want?
- Real big.

87
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,879
You should be in the stand already.

88
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,211
It's a big peach day.

89
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:35,357
- Takin' her to town with me.
- What for?

90
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,621
She needs a training bra.
She gots to get measured.

91
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:45,723
How much something like that cost?

92
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,018
Happy birthday.

93
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,098
So what's in town anyway?

94
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,228
I'm registerin' to vote.

95
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:21,967
Rosaleen, news said a colored man in Mississippi
was killed for doing that.

96
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,270
Good thing we ain't
in Mississippi then.

97
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,677
I saw you scribblin' one of your stories
in the stand yesterday.

98
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,979
Go on. Tell it.

99
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,354
All right.

100
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,518
So The Supremes,
they're heading down Highway 4...

101
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,118
because they're going to Charleston
for a real big concert.

102
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,130
But suddenly, their back tire blows up...

103
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,462
and they go skiddin' across the road
and into a ditch.

104
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,628
So then two are saying
that Diana's burnin' the peach cobbler.

105
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,765
But she blocks the oven and she says, "I'm the
lead singer, and it's done when I say it's done. "

106
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,708
So I don't know what to do.
The Supremes are having a fight in my kitchen.

107
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,712
- But then suddenly we hear...
- Hey.

108
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,408
Ain't you Terence Ray's little girl?

109
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,917
Yes, sir. Lily.

110
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,921
<i>Daddy know you out here with her?</i>

111
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,083
Rosaleen works for us.

112
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,525
Whole lot of niggers been
coming through here today.

113
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,189
You wouldn't be going to
that secret meetin', would ya?

114
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,790
Well, hell, we ain't gotta
worry about this one.

115
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,099
Can't register to vote
if you can't write your own name.

116
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,574
Tell me, Lily. She a smart nigger
or a dumb nigger?

117
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,371
- Please, mister, we really need...
- Answer me, girl.

118
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:47,555
R- O-S-A-L-E-E-N.

119
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,093
No!

120
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,857
- Rosaleen! Stop!
- Put her there!

121
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,532
Apologize!

122
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,540
<i>Stop! No!</i>

123
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:05,270
<i>- Apologize!
- Rosaleen, just apologize!</i>

124
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,412
<i>Help! Somebody help!</i>

125
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,414
Quiet.

126
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,074
- Can somebody help?
- Apologize.

127
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,948
Daddy!

128
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,957
Your black ass gonna apologize
one way or the other.

129
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,230
Rosaleen. Rosaleen.

130
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,566
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- You have to help her.

131
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:36,403
<i>- Get in the goddamn truck.
- I ain't restin;...</i>

132
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,477
- till your nigger apologizes.
- I'm sorry, Frank!

133
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,605
- I promised her!
- Get in the goddamn truck.

134
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,652
She dumped snuff juice
on a white man...

135
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,346
on Frank Posey, for Christ's sake.

136
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,788
I wouldn't be surprised
if he flat-out kills her.

137
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:57,659
You don't mean that.
He wouldn't really kill her.

138
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,096
Sheriff s gonna take her to the hospital.
She'll be fine.

139
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,691
Goddamn it. What the hell
were you thinkin'?

140
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,515
Don't you leave this room, you hear?
I gotta settle payroll with...

141
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,884
You don't scare me.

142
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,457
- What'd you say?
- You're a coward.

143
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:31,018
My mother would never let you touch me!

144
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,722
That goddamn woman
give a shit about you.

145
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,958
She loved me.

146
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:38,364
I hate you!

147
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:50,803
<i>Now you listen here.</i>

148
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:55,749
Truth is, your sorry mama,
she ran off and left you.

149
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:02,525
<i>On the day she died, she come back
for the rest ofher things... not you.</i>

150
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:04,491
That ain't true.

151
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,530
It's not.

152
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,831
<i>Dr. Cash, please call the page.</i>

153
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,960
<i>Dr. Cash, please call
the page operator.</i>

154
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,815
Rosaleen.

155
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,714
They beat you again?

156
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:05,151
We gotta get you out of here.

157
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:08,622
- I can't get out of here. I'm in jail.
- You shouldn't be.

158
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,193
That's gotta go.

159
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,129
Rosaleen.

160
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:30,411
- This is crazy.
- Oh, it'll be all right.

161
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:32,311
It'll be all right.

162
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:40,746
Shh.

163
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,839
- A white girl come by here?
- Uh, no, sir. Nobody. I ain't moved from this spot.

164
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,201
<i>When I was born</i>

165
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:29,761
<i>My daddy said I was broken</i>

166
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:32,842
<i>Beginning of the end</i>

167
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:38,142
<i>- You gals be careful now.
- The life I hadn't chosen</i>

168
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:05,000
Let me get this straight.

169
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,338
You got us goin' to Tiburon...

170
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:10,607
'cause your mama got a picture
with that town written on the back?

171
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,739
That's it?

172
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,113
T. Ray said my mother left me
way before she died.

173
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,586
Well, it's not true.

174
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:25,160
He only made it up to punish me.
I know he did.

175
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:27,287
Knowing your daddy,
he could do a thing like that.

176
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:30,059
And my mother could never do
what he said she did.

177
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,437
Huh.

178
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,599
I get it.

179
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,733
You ran off'cause of
what he said, didn't you?

180
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,410
It ain't had nothin' to do
with me being in jail.

181
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:50,578
And here you got me worrying myself sick
about you getting in trouble 'cause of me.

182
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:54,953
So what you fixin' to do? Go door-to-door
askin' folks about your mama?

183
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,549
- That's your bright idea?
- I don't exactly have a plan, all right?

184
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,027
Well, you sure had one
back at the hospital.

185
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,894
Comin' in there and sayin',
"We gonna do this, and we gonna do that. "

186
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:06,366
And I'm supposed to follow you
like some dumb nigger like they said.

187
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,904
Well, you are dumb pouring your spit
on that man's shoe like that...

188
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:11,803
and dumber not to say you're sorry
if sayin' it will save your life.

189
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:14,001
That man was gonna come back
and kill you or worse.

190
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:17,774
And I go and I get you out of there,
and this is how you thank me?

191
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:21,206
Well, fine.

192
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:03,258
Are you all right?

193
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,687
I feel like I've been beaten
with a stick.

194
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:09,060
You have been beaten, remember?

195
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,964
But not with a stick.

196
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:23,372
I know you can't understand.

197
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,883
Apologizing to those men
would've just been a different way of dyin'...

198
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:30,214
'cept I have to live with it.

199
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:38,059
If I can find someplace open,
I'll buy us some food.

200
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,322
What we gonna do for beds?

201
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,762
Find a motel, I guess.

202
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,960
Lily, there ain't gonna be a place
that'll take a colored woman.

203
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:48,060
Well, what about
the Civil Rights Act?

204
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,698
Ain't nothin' but a piece of paper.

205
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,152
Excuse me, sir.
Are you serving food today?

206
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:10,090
Oh, yes, ma'am. We have
a Sunday plate special: Barbecued pork.

207
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:12,684
Um, we'll take two of those,
please, and two Cokes.

208
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,090
I don't believe
I've seen you before.

209
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,135
I'm not from here.
I'm... I'm just visiting my grandmother.

210
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:22,569
<i>Your daddy's gonna be so proud of you.</i>

211
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:24,469
- Afternoon, Carol.
- Hi.

212
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,041
- Why, don't you two look smart.
- When we get home...

213
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:29,475
You come on in, and I'll wrap
those up for you to go.

214
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,188
Miss, you change your mind?

215
00:22:46,296 --> 00:22:49,629
- Where did you get those?
- Oh, I know what you mean.

216
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,258
<i>Virgin Mary's pictured
as a colored woman.</i>

217
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:55,338
<i>But, see, the woman that makes
the honey is colored herself.</i>

218
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,736
Best honey in South Carolina.

219
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,502
What is her name?

220
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,407
August Boatwright.

221
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:04,605
Do you know where she lives?

222
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:09,310
Darnedest house you ever saw. Painted like
Pepto-Bismol. Your grandma's probably seen it.

223
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,156
<i>What do you think's goin'on?</i>

224
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,696
Look like they dressed for church.

225
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:23,357
<i>- Bye-bye!
- You think one of them's August?</i>

226
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:25,491
<i>Whoever she is, I hope she make honey...</i>

227
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,763
better than she picks out paint.

228
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:31,035
I like it.

229
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:53,528
Now, don't go gettin'
your hopes up, all right?

230
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,894
They got nowhere else to go.

231
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,246
Yes?

232
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:18,583
<i>- Are you August Boatwright?
- No.</i>

233
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,647
I'm June Boatwright.
August is my sister.

234
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,728
- You came to see her?
- Hi. I'm May Boatwright.

235
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,289
I'm August's sister too.

236
00:24:31,401 --> 00:24:33,665
Is she expecting you?

237
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,068
Um, I just saw some honey at the store,
and the man said that...

238
00:24:36,172 --> 00:24:38,163
You come for honey?

239
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:42,574
Why didn't you say so?
Come into the parlor. I'll go get her.

240
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,171
Then after that she gonna go get
September and October.

241
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:28,723
<i>Who we got here?</i>

242
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:34,890
I'm Lily and this is Rosaleen.

243
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:39,626
We need a place to stay.

244
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,672
You see, my mother died of tularemia when
I was little, and my daddy just got killed...

245
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:49,836
in a tractor accident on our farm in
Spartanburg County, so me and Rosaleen...

246
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:52,972
she's our housekeeper... we're on our way
to Virginia to stay with my Aunt Bernie.

247
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:55,414
'Cept I don't have money
for a train ticket or a motel...

248
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,543
and not that anyone
would take in a Negro woman...

249
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,884
even though it's a violation
of the Civil Rights Act.

250
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:11,758
- Looks like you've been beaten.
- She fell down some steps when we were leavin'.

251
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:14,530
Must've been a lot of steps.

252
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:37,858
May, honey, go on out to the wall
and finish your crying.

253
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:45,628
Is she all right?

254
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:48,067
I'm sorry.
We can't help you.

255
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,703
We can't have 'em living
on the side of the road.

256
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:56,245
Why don't you call your aunt,
see about her sending you some train fare?

257
00:26:56,346 --> 00:27:02,182
I would, but she just had a real big operation
and she's still stayin' in the hospital.

258
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:06,654
<i>So maybe Rosaleen and I couldjust work
for the money, and then just be on our way.</i>

259
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,728
Well...

260
00:27:12,829 --> 00:27:16,094
I guess Rosaleen can help
May in the kitchen...

261
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,224
and you can help me and Zach
with the bees.

262
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:20,666
August.

263
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,102
We have the cots in the honey house.

264
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:30,173
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

265
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:35,140
<i>I hope y'all like the smell ofhoney.</i>

266
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:37,151
<i>It can be a bit overwhelming at first...</i>

267
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,221
<i>but you'll get used to it.</i>

268
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:43,952
Zach and I sleep out here come in December
when we harvestin' honey round the clock.

269
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:49,058
It can get hot out here,
so you wanna keep that on.

270
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:51,065
You'll have to use
the bathroom in the house.

271
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:54,898
We never lock the door, so just come on in
whenever you need to.

272
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:58,405
- There you go.
- This ain't charity. I'll pay you back for it.

273
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,942
Oh, yeah, you can work it off.

274
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:04,013
I imagine y'all two wanna rest up.

275
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:09,881
If you get hungry, there's some sweet potato
biscuits on the stove. They're May's specialty.

276
00:28:09,986 --> 00:28:11,613
Thank you again, Miss August.

277
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,556
I'm sure sorry to hear about T. Ray.
Aunt Bernie too.

278
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,725
I know it wasn't right to lie,
but I didn't have a choice.

279
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:28,429
How come you ain't say nothin'
about your mama or show that picture?

280
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:30,438
Ain't that why we're here
in the first place?

281
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,338
If they knew I ran away,
they'd have to call T. Ray to come get me.

282
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:37,038
Then they'd find out you a fugitive
and they'd have to call the police.

283
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:41,776
I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
I really do.

284
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:46,685
I just need some time to figure out why,
so don't say anything.

285
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,849
Your secret.
You do what you want with it.

286
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,525
They're so cultured.

287
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,457
I never met Negro women
like them before.

288
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:02,595
- Just us dumb ignorant ones.
- That's not what I'm sayin'.

289
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:08,934
Guess I never met Negro women
like them neither.

290
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:12,606
- How much land did she say they got?
- Twenty-eight acres.

291
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:17,084
It's like it's got its own spot in the world,
where the outside don't come in.

292
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:19,017
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i>

293
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,488
We'll be safe here, right?

294
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,674
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

295
00:29:39,776 --> 00:29:41,767
You know she in
some kind of trouble.

296
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:44,540
Well, who's gonna
take 'em in if we don't?

297
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:47,343
No one around here.

298
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,680
So what if that trouble follow 'em?

299
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:55,855
I need to do this, all right?

300
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:27,649
<i>I went down to the water</i>

301
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:31,082
<i>All night long</i>

302
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,093
<i>I put my feet in</i>

303
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:42,530
<i>All night long</i>

304
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:46,472
<i>And I went down</i>

305
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:51,206
<i>To the water</i>

306
00:30:51,314 --> 00:30:54,715
<i>All night long</i>

307
00:30:54,817 --> 00:31:01,518
<i>And I put my dreams in</i>

308
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:07,262
<i>All night long</i>

309
00:31:08,664 --> 00:31:12,122
<i>And what you did to me</i>

310
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:14,135
<i>I</i>

311
00:31:14,237 --> 00:31:18,264
<i>I can't take no more</i>

312
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,044
<i>I'll take these bad things</i>

313
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:25,478
<i>And I'll</i>

314
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:33,488
<i>Lay them at the shore</i>

315
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:59,938
<i>You gonna break my car?</i>

316
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,949
<i>No, I'm not gonna break your car.</i>

317
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:04,781
<i>- I'm just askin: 'cause you're
lookin'a little confused.</i>

318
00:32:04,887 --> 00:32:08,220
<i>It is hotter than a pot of rice, and you got nerve
to give me a hard time? Give me that wrench.</i>

319
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:11,657
- No, you get it.
- Not gonna play, June Bug?

320
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,786
You gonna play?

321
00:32:15,298 --> 00:32:17,323
- Come here.
- No. What?

322
00:32:17,433 --> 00:32:19,526
- Come here now.
- What are you doing?

323
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:21,102
- You know what we doing.
- I don't dance.

324
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,866
- Oh, you're dancin' now.
- No, I don't. I don't dance.

325
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:27,306
- No, no. Get off.
- Come here.

326
00:32:28,811 --> 00:32:32,042
<i>- Come on, June.
- Don't you pick me up.</i>

327
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:33,979
Stop it.

328
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:36,551
Place a beehive on my grave

329
00:32:36,652 --> 00:32:40,213
<i>And let the honey
soak through</i>

330
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:42,985
When I'm dead and gone

331
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:46,027
- That's what I want from you
- Oh, thank you.

332
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:48,995
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

333
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:51,896
<i>- But I'll stick with my plot
- Mornin;</i>

334
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,231
- Mornin'.
- You sleep all right?

335
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:56,897
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- Come on. Grab yourself a chair.</i>

336
00:32:57,006 --> 00:33:00,100
- Okay.
- Hey.

337
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:03,542
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

338
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,718
<i>- So, who's that man out there?
- Oh, that's Neil.</i>

339
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:15,222
He teaches at the school
whereJune teaches music.

340
00:33:15,324 --> 00:33:18,851
- He's sweet on her.
- It seems like she's sweet on him too.

341
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:21,122
Yeah, but she won't say so.

342
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,666
He tried every which way to get her
to marry him, but she won't.

343
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,736
- How come?
- Too scared.

344
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:30,738
<i>May, June might think that's a little personal.</i>

345
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,900
<i>Hell, I'll tell any folk that'll listen
I threw my man out.</i>

346
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,707
- Put his brain in a bird
and the bird'll fly backwards.

347
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:45,118
<i>Mmm.</i>

348
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:48,384
How come y'all got names
from a calendar?

349
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,220
Our mama loved spring and summer.

350
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:57,098
We had an April too, but...

351
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:00,902
she died when she was little.

352
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:13,743
- You ain't gonna fix that car.
- I'm gonna fix it.

353
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:20,422
<i>What set May off?</i>

354
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:23,151
She upset 'cause
you won't marry Neil.

355
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,689
See that? You should go on and marry me
and quit upsettin' your sister.

356
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:29,992
Get out of here.

357
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:32,829
No, woman, you promised me pancakes,
and I ain't leavin' till I get 'em.

358
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:36,462
You must be Rosaleen. Neil.

359
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:38,039
- And you must be Lily.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,166
What's burnin'?

361
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,711
Don't worry.
We'll just make you another one.

362
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:52,344
Or how about some grits?

363
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:55,049
No. Thank you.
That's... That's all right.

364
00:34:55,157 --> 00:34:56,954
I'm just not really hungry.

365
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,391
Then let's get to work.

366
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:01,292
Check on May.

367
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:04,730
I'm going to the N.A.A.C.P. Offices.
We're canvassing voters this morning.

368
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,901
<i>Uh, wait.
What about my pancakes?</i>

369
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,665
The batter's right there
by the griddle.

370
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:15,239
Now how could beauty be so evil?

371
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:21,710
I've been stung so many times,
I have immunity.

372
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:24,012
They barely even hurt me.

373
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,886
But since you don't, you need
to know beeyard etiquette.

374
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,221
- Beeyard etiquette?
- You see...

375
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:33,318
the world's really
just one big beeyard.

376
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:36,193
The same rules work in both places.

377
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:42,195
Don't be afraid, as no life-lovin' bee
wants to sting you.

378
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:47,332
But don't be an idiot.
That's why we wear long sleeves and long pants.

379
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:52,039
And don't swat.
Don't even think about swattin'.

380
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:54,912
And above all, send the bees love.

381
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:58,851
<i>Every little thing wants to be loved.</i>

382
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,281
Let's go.

383
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:30,509
Now, we'll constantly
be checking the hives.

384
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:35,454
We have to make sure the queens have enough
room to lay their eggs, otherwise we get swarms.

385
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,888
What do you mean, a swarm?

386
00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:43,226
When you get a queen and a group
of independent-minded bees...

387
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:49,293
that split off and look for another place to live,
then you get swarms.

388
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:51,373
And I lose my bees.

389
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:54,739
So, what we have to do is...

390
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,804
take out the frames
filled with honey...

391
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,245
and put in empty ones.

392
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:13,417
Now, the smoke, it calms the bees...

393
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,329
and it masks the alarm scent
released by the guard bees.

394
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,948
Why, you ain't scared a lick, huh?

395
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:44,014
I love you. I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

396
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:46,117
All right.

397
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,504
Easy movement.

398
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,137
See right there, Lily?

399
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:09,343
That's the queen... the large one.

400
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:16,987
<i>That wall behind the house...</i>

401
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:19,686
Why does it have little pieces
of paper in it?

402
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:22,457
Oh, well, that's May's wall.

403
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:25,033
She made it herself.

404
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:27,694
I guess you noticed
she a little different, huh?

405
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:29,703
She sure gets upset easy.

406
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:34,603
She had a twin sister, April.

407
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,144
- The one who died.
- Mm-hmm.

408
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:41,342
It's like the two of them were
one soul sharing two bodies.

409
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,783
If April got a toothache,
May's gum would plump up red.

410
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:47,879
One time my father used
a belt strap on April.

411
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,391
I swear, welts rose up
on May's legs too.

412
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:57,923
When April died, it was like the whole world
became May's twin sister.

413
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:00,297
And we tried for years
to get her help...

414
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:03,963
but the doctors just kept
telling us to put her away.

415
00:39:04,073 --> 00:39:07,600
SoJune and I come up with
this idea of the "wailing wall. "

416
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:12,204
- What kind of wall?
- The "wailing wall," like the one in Jerusalem.

417
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:17,217
TheJewish people go there to mourn. See,
they write their prayers on tiny pieces of paper...

418
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,253
and then they tuck 'em in the wall.

419
00:39:19,355 --> 00:39:22,620
And that's what Miss May does.

420
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:28,322
Those bits of paper are
all the heavy feelings May carries around.

421
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,024
Seems like the only thing
that helps her.

422
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,664
Poor Miss May.

423
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:42,506
Yeah. Poor Miss May.

424
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:55,582
That's Zach's car.
He must be in the honey house.

425
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:57,921
Why don't you go in and say hello.

426
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:05,898
All right, this one's dedicated
to all my honeys.

427
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,697
Oh... Don't worry.
You my honey too.

428
00:40:08,804 --> 00:40:13,332
<i>Baby, I need your lovin'</i>

429
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:16,707
Got to have all of your lovin'

430
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:21,181
Baby, I need your lovin'

431
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,444
Got to have all of your lovin'

432
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:33,322
I w... I was just singin'.

433
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:35,727
I'm Lily.

434
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:37,958
I'm staying with Miss August
and them for a while.

435
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:41,969
Oh. Well, um, I'm-I'm Zachary Taylor,
her godson.

436
00:40:42,071 --> 00:40:43,868
Zachary Taylor was a president.

437
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:47,840
Yeah, so I heard.

438
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:50,639
Come here. Look.

439
00:40:50,746 --> 00:40:54,238
See? "Zachary Lincoln Taylor. "

440
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:04,119
Uh, Miss August told me about
you bein' here helpin' out.

441
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,196
She didn't mention anything
about you being white.

442
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,565
Maybe she didn't notice.

443
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:29,018
Ooh.

444
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,560
- Mmm, mmm.
- Just put it in.

445
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,495
Miss August, you know
I got stung today, right?

446
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,498
Did you? Where?

447
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,034
Right there.
Probably can't see it much.

448
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,501
No, I'm telling you that
they don't intend on voting.

449
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,603
<i>But you gotta see it from the other side.</i>

450
00:41:56,714 --> 00:42:00,013
<i>The time is right</i>

451
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:04,144
<i>I'm gonna pack my bags</i>

452
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:10,091
<i>And take thatjourney
down the road</i>

453
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,230
<i>'Cause over the mountain</i>

454
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:17,301
<i>- I see the bright sunshine
- Go. Let it go.</i>

455
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:23,206
<i>But I want to live inside the glow</i>

456
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,212
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

457
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,544
<i>I wanna go
to the place where</i>

458
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,484
<i>I am nothing and everything</i>

459
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,420
<i>That exists between</i>

460
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,890
<i>Here and nowhere</i>

461
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:48,162
<i>I wanna go the place where</i>

462
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,632
<i>Time has no consequences
Oh, yeah</i>

463
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,635
- Hear the poppin'?
- Yeah.

464
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,705
<i>- The sky opens to
- It's from capping. Now you try.</i>

465
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,399
- Whoa. Whoa.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,068
<i>I wanna go to beautiful</i>

467
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,577
<i>Beautiful</i>

468
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,343
<i>- Put the uncapped frames in the spinner.
- Beautiful, I wanna go to</i>

469
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,886
<i>- Pushes out all the honey.
- Beautiful, beautiful</i>

470
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,955
<i>Beautiful</i>

471
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,287
<i>I wanna go to
beautiful, beautiful</i>

472
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,487
Miss August says you can run like Wilma Rudolph.

473
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,827
Yeah, in a championship game
I was running everywhere like...

474
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,424
- Uh, hey, hey.
- Oh, no!

475
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,471
<i>Beautiful
I wanna go to</i>

476
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,769
<i>Beautiful, beautiful</i>

477
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,970
<i>Beautiful
I wanna go to</i>

478
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,309
<i>Beautiful</i>

479
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,449
Hmm.

480
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,213
- You want me to light your candle?
- Yes, ma'am.

481
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,986
You all enjoy.

482
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,223
Thank you, Miss May.

483
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:58,063
She calls it a candlestick salad.

484
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:01,002
She's been making 'em for me
since I was little.

485
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,597
- It looks like...
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know.

486
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,303
<i>May?</i>

487
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:11,370
So, what's your favorite
subject in school?

488
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,974
English. I was plannin' on
being a writer.

489
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:21,057
I don't really think I got much of
a future now, being an orphan and all.

490
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:26,289
Don't writers, like,
just imagine things you don't see?

491
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,362
You should imagine yourself
having a future.

492
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,994
That's what I do.

493
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:37,563
Playing professional football?

494
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,236
Why do white people always think sports
is the only way we could be successful?

495
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,812
I wanna be a lawyer.

496
00:44:46,288 --> 00:44:49,621
I'm sorry. I just thought
'cause you were good at it.

497
00:44:49,725 --> 00:44:51,693
I've never heard of a Negro lawyer.

498
00:44:51,793 --> 00:44:54,227
You never heard of
Thurgood Marshall?

499
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,991
- No.
- Forget it.

500
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:08,068
All right. I'm picturing you
as a lawyer.

501
00:45:08,176 --> 00:45:12,306
Take the case of a girl who's wrongly accused
of hurtin' somebody.

502
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:16,874
At the very last minute, you get the truth by
trickin' the real bad guy on the witness stand.

503
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,183
You bust his ass with the truth.

504
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,684
Yeah.

505
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:30,060
Zach, the ass-bustin' lawyer.

506
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,133
Oh. Thank you, May.

507
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:38,206
- Here.
- No gravy.

508
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:41,173
<i>- Smells good.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

509
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:49,373
So how are things coming
with you, Lily?

510
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:53,511
Things are coming fine,
Miss June. Thank you.

511
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:57,422
- I made banana daisy...
- You've been here almost a week now.

512
00:45:57,526 --> 00:46:00,859
Your aunt must be worried.

513
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:04,227
If you want us to leave,
me and Rosaleen will be on our way.

514
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:08,769
Oh, heavens to Betsy, Lily. Nobody wants you
to leave till you're good and ready.

515
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:16,170
Why do you put a Negro Mary
on your honey?

516
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,010
<i>You mean why is she black...</i>

517
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:22,286
or why is she on the honey?

518
00:46:23,688 --> 00:46:26,782
<i>- I guess both.
- Tell her, August.</i>

519
00:46:31,195 --> 00:46:34,130
- I'm Sugar Girl.
- I'm Cressie.

520
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:40,335
- I'm Doll.
- And I'm her daughter, Violet.

521
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:43,373
And I'm Greta, Zachary's mama.

522
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:45,567
Mmm, I love Sundays.

523
00:46:45,676 --> 00:46:47,644
What the hell kind
of church is this?

524
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:53,775
- It's been a while since we told
the story of our Mary. - Mm-hmm.

525
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:58,480
And since we have visitors here who've
never heard it, I thought we'd tell it again.

526
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,490
<i>- That's right. Tell the story.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

527
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:03,583
<i>Back in the days of slavery...</i>

528
00:47:03,694 --> 00:47:07,221
our people would go
to the praise house on Sunday...

529
00:47:07,331 --> 00:47:09,822
and ask the Lord
to send them rescue.

530
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:14,337
<i>One day a slave named Obadiah
was loading bricks onto a boat...</i>

531
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:18,841
<i>and he saw somethin'that had
washed up on the shore.</i>

532
00:47:18,943 --> 00:47:21,207
<i>Movin'closer...</i>

533
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:25,214
<i>he saw that it was the wooden figure of a woman.</i>

534
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:28,774
<i>Her body was growin'
out of a block of wood.</i>

535
00:47:28,886 --> 00:47:31,582
<i>A black woman...</i>

536
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:34,556
With her arm lifted up
and her fist balled out.

537
00:47:34,658 --> 00:47:36,387
<i>Mmm.</i>

538
00:47:36,494 --> 00:47:40,487
<i>Obadiah knelt down on
the wet sand before her...</i>

539
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:45,558
<i>- and to his shock he heard her voice clear as day.
- Mm-hmm!</i>

540
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:50,629
- She said, "It's all right. "
- "It's all right. "

541
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:52,265
<i>- "I'm here. "
- "I'm here. "</i>

542
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:54,276
<i>"I'll be taking care of you now. "</i>

543
00:47:54,378 --> 00:47:58,712
<i>And Obadiah knew at that moment
that God had sent her.</i>

544
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:04,749
Now, everyone knew the mother ofJesus' name
was Mary, and that she was strong...

545
00:48:04,855 --> 00:48:09,656
<i>- Come on.
- And constant and had a mother's heart.</i>

546
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,456
<i>And here she was...</i>

547
00:48:12,563 --> 00:48:15,726
<i>sent to them across
the same waters...</i>

548
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,996
<i>that had brought them
there in chains.</i>

549
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:22,470
- Seemed like she knew everything they suffered.
- Everything!

550
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:27,101
<i>And so the people went up
one at a time...</i>

551
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:31,472
and touched their hand
to her chest...

552
00:48:31,582 --> 00:48:35,916
wantin' to grab on to
the solace in her heart.

553
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,116
- Mary filled their hearts with fearlessness.
- She filled their hearts!

554
00:48:40,224 --> 00:48:43,091
And if they ever grew weak...

555
00:48:43,194 --> 00:48:45,094
they had only to touch
her heart again.

556
00:48:45,196 --> 00:48:47,130
Touch her heart!

557
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:50,029
- Touch her heart.
- Touch her heart.

558
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:39,907
<i>Touch her heart.</i>

559
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,885
Lily.

560
00:49:43,988 --> 00:49:47,480
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

561
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:49,491
<i>No!</i>

562
00:49:49,593 --> 00:49:51,356
- I'm your husband!
- Lily!

563
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:53,362
...and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

564
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:55,159
<i>Just let me go!</i>

565
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,734
<i>No!</i>

566
00:49:57,835 --> 00:50:01,271
<i>...pray for us sinners now...</i>

567
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,431
and at the hour of our death.

568
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,203
<i>- Amen.
- Lily!</i>

569
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:11,442
<i>No!</i>

570
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:13,574
<i>June, what's gotten into you?</i>

571
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:17,978
Oh!

572
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:20,079
Lily.

573
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:25,962
Girl, since when
you started faintin'?

574
00:50:29,466 --> 00:50:31,366
Could I get some water?

575
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:35,734
- Of course.
- Wait. Um...

576
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,932
Rosaleen, could you get it, please?

577
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:54,991
This your room?

578
00:50:56,493 --> 00:51:00,930
- Blue is my favorite color.
- Mine too.

579
00:51:01,031 --> 00:51:03,591
Birds of a feather.

580
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:07,501
- Sorry I messed up your church.
- Oh, that's all right.

581
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:10,972
We go on all day if somebody
don't stop us.

582
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:12,975
I just hope you all right.

583
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:20,482
I think it was the heat.

584
00:51:21,652 --> 00:51:24,018
<i>Felt like it was
90 degrees in there.</i>

585
00:51:28,058 --> 00:51:30,686
Yes, the heat.

586
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:35,954
Heat'll make a person
do strange things.

587
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:08,149
I've made my reservation
I'm leaving town tomorrow

588
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,653
- I'll find somebody new
and there'll be no more sorrow

589
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,222
That's what I do each time
but I can't follow through

590
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:19,623
I can't break away
though you make me cry

591
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:24,131
I can't break away
I can't say good-bye

592
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:27,929
No, I'll never, ever
break away from you

593
00:52:28,036 --> 00:52:31,563
No, no
No, no, no, no

594
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:33,868
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

595
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,842
Who can think with all that?

596
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:41,780
<i>Well, that's your problem...
You think too much.</i>

597
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:45,546
Try going with your feelings
once in a blue moon.

598
00:52:45,654 --> 00:52:47,622
You won't believe what
people in town are sayin'.

599
00:52:47,722 --> 00:52:51,886
Sayin'Jack Palance is coming to Tiburon,
and he's bringing a Negro woman with him.

600
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:53,654
<i>What in the world?</i>

601
00:52:53,762 --> 00:52:57,289
- Who's Jack Palance?
- He's a movie star... a white one.

602
00:52:57,399 --> 00:53:00,800
I ain't never heard...
I... I have never heard of him.

603
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,097
<i>They say his sister lives here.
He's comin'to visit her...</i>

604
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:05,571
and he intend to take this woman
to the theater on Friday.

605
00:53:05,674 --> 00:53:09,576
<i>- White folks talkin'about standin'guard outside.
- That's just talk.</i>

606
00:53:09,678 --> 00:53:11,475
<i>And these idiots are determined
to fight this law till they...</i>

607
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,070
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

608
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,118
- Miss May?
- Mm-hmm?

609
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,280
I saw how nice you did
Rosaleen's hair...

610
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:24,290
and I was wonderin' if maybe
you could help me with mine.

611
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:28,009
That'll be easy.

612
00:53:29,577 --> 00:53:31,477
<i>Hmm.</i>

613
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,024
It's ironic how white people
hate us so much...

614
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,500
when so many of'em
been raised by black women.

615
00:53:45,438 --> 00:53:48,100
- Place a beehive on my grave
- Ooh.

616
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:53,173
June Bug! June, I know you hear me.

617
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,043
If I make this shot, you'll give me your hand?
Watch this.

618
00:54:01,187 --> 00:54:03,178
<i>What you laughin'at?</i>

619
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,226
You think somethin' bein' an impossibility
makes you think about it even more?

620
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,799
- Like what?
- I don't know.

621
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:17,426
Like... kissin'.

622
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:20,165
That ain't impossible.

623
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:24,266
When I was 15, I made
a 7 UP cake for this boy.

624
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:27,107
After that,
he kissed me all the time.

625
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:29,306
What'd it feel like?

626
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:31,576
Like I was gonna burst.

627
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:39,222
Miss May, I know you get
real sad sometimes.

628
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:43,353
My daddy never feels.

629
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:46,261
He never felt anything.

630
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:48,799
I had rather be like you.

631
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:56,435
A worker bee weigh less
than a flower petal...

632
00:54:56,542 --> 00:55:01,104
but she can fly with a load
heavier than her.

633
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,775
But she only lives
four or five weeks.

634
00:55:06,486 --> 00:55:10,855
Sometimes not feelin' is
the only way you can survive.

635
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:22,660
You want me to help you
make a 7 UP cake?

636
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:27,329
Hold that.

637
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,718
- It's purple.
- Yeah.

638
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:47,554
When the weather turns hot,
the flowers, they start to dry up.

639
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,128
The bees, they start sucking
on that elderberry.

640
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:53,189
That makes purple honey.

641
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,325
There. See?

642
00:55:57,436 --> 00:56:01,338
People'll pay two dollars a jar
for purple honey.

643
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:52,189
<i>- I'm so lonely
- You all right?</i>

644
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:54,350
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

645
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:58,393
<i>- Because.
- No. Why?</i>

646
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:01,193
- Why does it always have to come back to this?
- Because I love you and you me.

647
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,701
- Neil, I don't wanna get married. I don't wanna get married.
- That's what people in love do.

648
00:57:04,804 --> 00:57:07,272
- I don't wanna be married today or tomorrow or ever.
- It's about that time!

649
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:09,773
- What are you so scared of?
- I'm not scared of anything!

650
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:15,778
Then you are the most
selfish bitch I ever met.

651
00:57:19,385 --> 00:57:21,285
What?

652
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:23,287
What did you just say to me?

653
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,653
<i>- Oh, Lord.
- What did you just call me?</i>

654
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:28,454
<i>How dare you call me that, Neil.
Neil, I'm talkin'to you.</i>

655
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:31,121
You better turn around
and listen to me right now.

656
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,255
You better come back here
and apologize right now!

657
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,802
<i>Don't you ever plan on comin'back then!
I don't even need you in my life!</i>

658
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:41,064
How dare... Don't come back!

659
00:57:41,173 --> 00:57:44,165
<i>- Don't worry, May.
- Don't come back!</i>

660
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:52,115
<i>I bet they'll be back holdin'hands
on the porch swing tomorrow.</i>

661
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:56,917
I don't know, Lily.
Some people rather die than forgive.

662
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,184
And June is one of'em.

663
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:03,558
She still hasn't forgiven me for paintin'
the house, and that was 10 years ago.

664
00:58:03,663 --> 00:58:07,155
Well, how come, if your favorite color is blue,
you painted the house so pink?

665
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:09,598
That was May's doin'.

666
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:12,102
She was with me the day
I went to the paint store...

667
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:16,106
and she latched onto this sample
called Caribbean Pink.

668
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:20,201
Said it made her wanna dance
a Spanish flamenco.

669
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:23,908
I thought it was the tackiest color
I ever seen in my life.

670
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:27,884
But if it could lift May's heart,
then I guess she ought to live in it.

671
00:58:27,987 --> 00:58:29,955
Well, that was sure nice of you.

672
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:33,583
Well, some things
don't matter that much, Lily.

673
00:58:33,693 --> 00:58:36,560
Like the color
of a house and whatnot.

674
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:39,290
<i>But liftin' someone's heart...
now that matters.</i>

675
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,327
- Were you ever in love?
- Course I was.

676
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,372
- But you didn't love him enough to marry him.
- Well, I loved him enough.

677
00:58:47,473 --> 00:58:50,636
I just loved my freedom more.

678
00:58:50,743 --> 00:58:55,339
I can't think of one thing I'd rather have
than somebody loving me.

679
00:58:59,518 --> 00:59:01,008
Where are all the bees?

680
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:08,870
You hear that?

681
00:59:08,972 --> 00:59:11,167
They're coolin' the hive.

682
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:15,211
That's the sound of 100,000
bee wings fannin' the air.

683
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:22,808
People have no idea about the complicated life
goin' on inside a beehive.

684
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,184
Here. Let me help you with that.

685
00:59:25,289 --> 00:59:30,158
See, bees have a secret life
we don't know anything about.

686
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:43,372
<i>Yeah!</i>

687
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,268
<i>Well, if this ain't the livin'end.</i>

688
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:49,038
Now come over here. You gonna get wet.

689
00:59:49,146 --> 00:59:52,274
Oh, Lord, Lord!

690
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:59,589
Would you keep it down?

691
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:03,387
- Keep it down! I'm practicin'.
- You come over here, you gonna get wet.

692
01:00:05,229 --> 01:00:07,857
- Oh, damn it to hell!
- Run, Lily!

693
01:00:07,965 --> 01:00:09,933
Oh, damn it to hell!

694
01:00:12,302 --> 01:00:14,896
How dare you!

695
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:17,530
<i>- You out of your mind?
- All right now, June.</i>

696
01:00:20,544 --> 01:00:22,705
<i>Come on, June.</i>

697
01:01:24,608 --> 01:01:26,872
- Where you goin', June?
- June?

698
01:01:26,977 --> 01:01:29,411
Come on back.

699
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:39,116
<i>Oh. Miss May.</i>

700
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:42,157
Got thirsty.

701
01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:02,370
I saw a roach.

702
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:25,351
<i>The roaches will
follow this right out the door.</i>

703
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,725
Works every time.

704
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,731
Miss May?

705
01:02:33,836 --> 01:02:36,100
Did you know a Deborah?

706
01:02:36,205 --> 01:02:38,105
Deborah Owens?

707
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:41,608
<i>She's a white woman from Virginia.</i>

708
01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:45,509
It would've been a long time ago.

709
01:02:45,615 --> 01:02:47,879
Oh, yes.

710
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:50,350
Deborah Owens.

711
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:53,286
She stayed out in the honey house.

712
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:56,620
She was the sweetest thing.

713
01:03:12,575 --> 01:03:15,373
Think I'll go out
to the wall for a while.

714
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,465
Give it back!

715
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:45,573
<i>Zach! Come back here.</i>

716
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,314
Thank you.

717
01:03:56,786 --> 01:03:59,550
<i>Hey. Lily, come ride with me.</i>

718
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:02,852
Uh, I gotta drop some honey off
to Mr. Forrest. I want you to meet him.

719
01:04:02,959 --> 01:04:05,359
Oh, I gotta talk to Miss August.
You know where she is?

720
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:09,454
Uh, she went to Columbia to go pick up
a new blade for the spinner.

721
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:11,465
Oh.

722
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:27,315
<i>Thought a new notebook might
help you start writin'again.</i>

723
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:32,019
Whoa.

724
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:42,527
My mother stayed in
the honey house, just like me.

725
01:04:42,632 --> 01:04:45,829
What? When?

726
01:04:45,935 --> 01:04:49,132
I don't know.
I don't know anything about her.

727
01:04:49,238 --> 01:04:53,834
Maybe it was before I was born.
Or maybe she left me like my daddy said.

728
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:55,843
So, wait.

729
01:04:57,613 --> 01:04:59,843
You mean to tell me...

730
01:04:59,949 --> 01:05:02,383
all that stuff about your aunt...

731
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:05,079
and... and just passin' through...

732
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:07,485
You made that up?

733
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:11,489
Why not just tell the truth?

734
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:15,395
'Cause I'm afraid the truth
is gonna wreck everything.

735
01:05:40,189 --> 01:05:42,089
<i>There he is.</i>

736
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:44,022
And who might
this pretty young lady be?

737
01:05:44,126 --> 01:05:47,220
This is Lily.
She's stayin' with Miss August.

738
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:50,526
- You stayin' in her house?
- Yes, ma'am.

739
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:54,933
Well, Miss August is a good friend of mine.
I hope you're enjoyin' yourself.

740
01:05:55,037 --> 01:05:57,870
- Yes, sir.
- I have an appointment with the dentist.

741
01:05:57,973 --> 01:05:59,770
Okay.

742
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:04,278
<i>- What you working on?
- Run-of-the-mill stuff.</i>

743
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,781
<i>Hey, I got somethin'for you.
Wanna head up to the office?</i>

744
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:13,344
- Are you, uh, lookin' forward to school gettin' started up?
- Yes, sir. And football season...

745
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:15,686
Oh, yeah.
We're lookin' forward to that.

746
01:06:49,759 --> 01:06:51,659
Hello. Operator.

747
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,128
I'd like to make a call
to Sylvan 7-1710.

748
01:06:55,231 --> 01:06:58,166
Hold while I connect
your call, please.

749
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:05,597
Hello? Hello!

750
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:14,879
Look what he gave me.
I'm startin' my law library.

751
01:07:14,984 --> 01:07:17,145
That's nice.

752
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:19,153
Hey.

753
01:07:22,124 --> 01:07:25,355
Lily, I know you're scared
the truth is gonna wreck things.

754
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:28,191
Findin' out the truth
is only half of it.

755
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:32,231
It's what you do with it
that matters.

756
01:07:32,334 --> 01:07:34,234
Right?

757
01:07:41,677 --> 01:07:44,009
When's the last time
you seen a movie?

758
01:07:44,113 --> 01:07:46,013
I don't remember.

759
01:07:46,115 --> 01:07:48,242
<i>Come on. We gonna go see Surf Party.</i>

760
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,808
- But what...
- But nothin'. Come on. Let's go.

761
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:02,126
- One adult, please.
- Here you go.

762
01:08:03,974 --> 01:08:05,066
It can't hurt, you know?

763
01:08:09,046 --> 01:08:11,037
<i>One adult and one child.</i>

764
01:08:13,517 --> 01:08:15,747
<i>Everybody waxed up?</i>

765
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:19,618
<i>- This is a surfboard.
- You're kidding.</i>

766
01:08:19,723 --> 01:08:23,181
<i>This is the nose.
The sides are called rails.</i>

767
01:08:24,895 --> 01:08:26,863
Thank you.

768
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:32,332
<i>- The first step is...
- Come on!</i>

769
01:08:33,136 --> 01:08:35,570
Hey, boy!

770
01:08:35,672 --> 01:08:38,232
- We're gonna teach you a lesson, boy!
- Hey! It's not his fault!

771
01:08:38,342 --> 01:08:40,071
Let him go!

772
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:42,941
Shut your mouth, nigger lover!

773
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:47,073
<i>- Where are they takin'him?
- Get him in the truck.</i>

774
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:49,948
- Just trying to gather up all the pieces.
- You're wastin' time!

775
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,953
- You know who took him.
- Is that right?

776
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:54,523
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- All right. Now hold on here, folks.</i>

777
01:08:54,624 --> 01:08:57,058
<i>Soon as we know anything,
we'll get back to you.</i>

778
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,890
Neil, counselor, ladies.
Come on. Let's go.

779
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:06,269
I'm gonna get some men together.
We'll look ourselves.

780
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:09,032
If you'll have me,
I'm willin' to help.

781
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:18,571
May doesn't need to know about this.

782
01:09:23,387 --> 01:09:26,117
Nah, it'll be too much.

783
01:09:32,763 --> 01:09:35,823
<i>Black boys don't come back, August.</i>

784
01:09:35,932 --> 01:09:39,333
<i>He's gonna be found,
and he's gonna be all right.</i>

785
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:42,132
<i>- How could you say that?
- I have to.</i>

786
01:09:59,923 --> 01:10:03,188
Please let him be okay.

787
01:10:23,647 --> 01:10:25,638
Lily's gonna look so pretty in this.

788
01:10:31,455 --> 01:10:34,185
August, where are your scissors?

789
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:37,689
Uh, in my room.

790
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:54,203
<i>- Hey, Greta.
- Hey, May.</i>

791
01:10:54,311 --> 01:10:56,211
You been to see Mary?

792
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:59,181
Zach is still missin'.

793
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:07,184
We have to pray, May.
You understand?

794
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,485
We got to pray, May.

795
01:11:35,352 --> 01:11:38,753
<i>- Who was at the door?
- May, was somebody at the door?</i>

796
01:11:41,925 --> 01:11:43,825
Greta.

797
01:11:45,095 --> 01:11:47,495
No news on Zach.

798
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,108
Why didn't you tell me?

799
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:03,742
You all right?

800
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:08,450
May?

801
01:12:08,552 --> 01:12:10,645
May!

802
01:12:11,755 --> 01:12:13,382
<i>Answer me, May.
You all right?</i>

803
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:15,958
What's happened to her?
I never seen her like this.

804
01:12:16,059 --> 01:12:19,859
- May?
- May?

805
01:12:19,963 --> 01:12:21,863
May.

806
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,991
I'm all right.

807
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,398
Glad to see you can talk.

808
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:34,274
Come on, Sister.

809
01:12:34,377 --> 01:12:36,709
We gonna run you a nice hot bath.

810
01:12:38,081 --> 01:12:40,641
I need to go to the wall.

811
01:12:51,494 --> 01:12:53,394
May?

812
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:55,930
Where's May?
Her bath is ready.

813
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:58,193
She's still out there.

814
01:13:04,808 --> 01:13:06,867
May?

815
01:13:08,278 --> 01:13:10,178
May?

816
01:13:11,748 --> 01:13:13,648
May!

817
01:13:16,853 --> 01:13:18,878
May?

818
01:13:20,023 --> 01:13:22,218
<i>May!</i>

819
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:24,623
<i>- May?
- May!</i>

820
01:13:26,496 --> 01:13:28,987
<i>- May?
- May!</i>

821
01:13:31,568 --> 01:13:34,059
<i>Come on, May.</i>

822
01:13:40,977 --> 01:13:42,877
<i>May?</i>

823
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:48,583
<i>May?</i>

824
01:13:51,788 --> 01:13:53,688
June?

825
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:58,657
<i>May!</i>

826
01:14:05,535 --> 01:14:10,234
<i>June! June!</i>

827
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,002
May!

828
01:14:13,109 --> 01:14:16,442
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! August!

829
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:21,744
August.

830
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:37,266
No!
Oh, no!

831
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:40,530
- Oh, no!
- Oh, May.

832
01:14:43,473 --> 01:14:46,874
<i>We gotta get her out.
We gotta get her out.</i>

833
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:59,253
<i>May!</i>

834
01:14:59,355 --> 01:15:01,516
Why you do that?

835
01:16:06,756 --> 01:16:09,122
Sweet Mary.

836
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:19,167
<i>Zach!</i>

837
01:16:21,137 --> 01:16:23,298
Zach.

838
01:16:27,277 --> 01:16:29,802
<i>Oh.</i>

839
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:31,813
I'm so sorry.

840
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:33,974
Miss May did what she did
'cause of me.

841
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,677
<i>Come on, now.
It was May who did it.</i>

842
01:16:36,786 --> 01:16:40,187
It's all right.
She wouldn't want you blaming yourself.

843
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:46,692
Oh. It's gonna be okay.

844
01:16:49,899 --> 01:16:51,958
It's good. It's good.

845
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,822
<i>Dear August and June...</i>

846
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:27,061
<i>I'm sorry to leave you like this.</i>

847
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,798
<i>But I know Zach is okay.</i>

848
01:17:29,906 --> 01:17:32,773
<i>My heart is telling me so.</i>

849
01:17:32,876 --> 01:17:34,776
<i>I hate you bein'sad...</i>

850
01:17:34,878 --> 01:17:38,939
<i>but think how happy I'll be
with April, Mama and Papa.</i>

851
01:17:40,283 --> 01:17:43,150
<i>I'm tired of carrying around
the weight of the world.</i>

852
01:17:43,253 --> 01:17:45,312
<i>I'm just gonna lay it down now.</i>

853
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:48,856
<i>It's my time to die...</i>

854
01:17:48,958 --> 01:17:51,654
<i>and it's your time to live.</i>

855
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:54,889
<i>Don't mess it up.</i>

856
01:17:56,099 --> 01:17:57,657
<i>Love, May.</i>

857
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,780
<i>I saw Mary</i>

858
01:18:12,882 --> 01:18:16,045
<i>She was walkin'on the water</i>

859
01:18:16,152 --> 01:18:18,814
<i>Smilin'at me</i>

860
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:23,120
<i>Hummin'her river song</i>

861
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:25,126
<i>And I tried wavin'</i>

862
01:18:25,228 --> 01:18:27,958
<i>But she was walkin'away</i>

863
01:18:28,064 --> 01:18:31,727
<i>She said that
she'd been waitin'on me</i>

864
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:35,497
<i>All day long</i>

865
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:51,815
<i>I tried to call her and said
Please come back</i>

866
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:57,291
<i>'Cause I didn't mean
to make you sad</i>

867
01:18:57,393 --> 01:18:59,293
<i>She said</i>

868
01:18:59,395 --> 01:19:03,729
<i>Well, don't you worry
'cause I'll see you again</i>

869
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:06,859
<i>But I hear my mother call</i>

870
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,939
<i>And I have to go</i>

871
01:20:04,394 --> 01:20:09,559
Place a beehive on my grave

872
01:20:09,665 --> 01:20:13,260
And let the honey
soak through

873
01:20:14,704 --> 01:20:18,572
When I'm dead and gone

874
01:20:18,674 --> 01:20:23,304
That's what I want from you

875
01:20:23,413 --> 01:20:28,373
The streets of heaven
are gold and sunny

876
01:20:28,484 --> 01:20:31,214
But I'll stick with my plot

877
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,687
And a pot of honey

878
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:39,353
Place a beehive on my grave

879
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:43,455
And let the honey
soak through

880
01:20:46,736 --> 01:20:48,636
Hmm.

881
01:20:53,943 --> 01:20:55,843
<i>I see you liked yours.</i>

882
01:20:55,945 --> 01:20:57,776
- Mm-hmm. It's the last one.
- Mmm.

883
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,939
<i>Mmm, girl, you did all right.</i>

884
01:21:00,049 --> 01:21:02,574
Aw. I'm the eldest.

885
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:05,449
- And the slowest.
- I'll make some more.

886
01:21:05,555 --> 01:21:08,615
- You hear that, June?
- Hmm.

887
01:21:08,724 --> 01:21:12,455
Think we might need
to change your name, Rosaleen.

888
01:21:12,562 --> 01:21:16,259
From now on, we gonna call you July.

889
01:21:18,468 --> 01:21:21,631
<i>Hmm. I concur.</i>

890
01:21:23,406 --> 01:21:25,772
<i>Some more of these.</i>

891
01:21:27,243 --> 01:21:30,337
<i>Mmm.</i>

892
01:21:35,318 --> 01:21:37,980
Sure you gonna be
all right in here by yourself?

893
01:21:43,493 --> 01:21:45,791
I don't mind sharing May's room.

894
01:21:45,895 --> 01:21:48,796
Just wanna be near her spirit.

895
01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:50,798
I'll be fine.

896
01:21:53,002 --> 01:21:54,902
See you in the mornin' then.

897
01:22:25,101 --> 01:22:27,001
Hey, Lily.

898
01:22:28,104 --> 01:22:30,402
This is my mother.

899
01:22:38,114 --> 01:22:40,014
I know, honey.

900
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:45,251
Your mama was
Deborah Fontanel Owens.

901
01:22:45,354 --> 01:22:47,254
You've known all this time?

902
01:22:47,356 --> 01:22:51,190
I knew she had a daughter.
But I thought it couldn't be you.

903
01:22:51,294 --> 01:22:56,061
But one look at you,
all I could see is Deborah at your age.

904
01:22:56,165 --> 01:22:57,962
You knew her when she was little?

905
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:01,036
I took care of her.

906
01:23:01,137 --> 01:23:03,799
Why didn't you tell me?

907
01:23:03,906 --> 01:23:07,239
Somethin' told me you wasn't
quite ready to know about her.

908
01:23:07,343 --> 01:23:12,246
I just wanted to give you a chance
to get on solid ground first.

909
01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:17,011
T. Ray...

910
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:19,144
he told me that my mo...

911
01:23:20,456 --> 01:23:23,653
He told me my mother
left me and ran away.

912
01:23:26,462 --> 01:23:29,693
I don't have any memory of her, but...

913
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:34,099
I know he's lyin'
'cause some things aren't possible.

914
01:23:34,203 --> 01:23:36,763
Children just don't have two parents
who refuse to love 'em.

915
01:23:36,872 --> 01:23:40,330
Is that what made you leave?

916
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:44,641
I know what I did was wrong.
I just seem to do all the wrong things.

917
01:23:46,349 --> 01:23:49,477
I don't mean to be a bad person,
but I just can't help it.

918
01:23:49,585 --> 01:23:53,783
So that's why I gotta go.
I brought the outside in here.

919
01:23:53,889 --> 01:23:57,017
And what happened
to Zach and Miss May...

920
01:23:57,126 --> 01:24:00,152
If I'd never come here,
it would've never happened.

921
01:24:00,263 --> 01:24:02,356
- Lily... Lily, that wasn't your fault.
- I wreck everything.

922
01:24:02,465 --> 01:24:04,524
Yes, it was.

923
01:24:04,634 --> 01:24:08,434
They were fightin' and screamin' and...

924
01:24:08,537 --> 01:24:12,268
She grabbed a gun, and he took it away from her,
and I just wanted to help her.

925
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:15,071
I just wanted to
give it back to her.

926
01:24:15,177 --> 01:24:17,441
- And I killed her.
- Who, Lily?

927
01:24:17,546 --> 01:24:20,845
My mother.
I killed my mother.

928
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:25,213
I'm unlovable.

929
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:33,521
Oh, Lily.

930
01:24:34,797 --> 01:24:36,697
You listen to me now.

931
01:24:39,769 --> 01:24:42,670
That's a terrible,
terrible thing for you to live with.

932
01:24:44,206 --> 01:24:47,607
But you're not unlovable, child.

933
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,008
There's love all around you.

934
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:56,578
Gimme your hand.

935
01:25:03,456 --> 01:25:07,017
<i>I started takin'care of Deborah
when she was nine, back in Virginia.</i>

936
01:25:07,127 --> 01:25:09,118
<i>Over seven years.</i>

937
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:13,165
<i>Till my grandmama died
and left me this place.</i>

938
01:25:13,266 --> 01:25:16,724
That's whyJune
resented you at first.

939
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:20,567
She never got over me
workin' in your mama's house.

940
01:25:20,674 --> 01:25:22,574
How did my mother get down here?

941
01:25:24,678 --> 01:25:28,239
She had an old friend from high school,
moved to Sylvan.

942
01:25:28,348 --> 01:25:32,375
Told her there were jobs,
and men back from the war.

943
01:25:32,485 --> 01:25:34,453
So she moved.

944
01:25:34,554 --> 01:25:36,613
I think it was 'cause of me though.

945
01:25:36,723 --> 01:25:39,487
I just think she wanted me nearby.

946
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:44,155
So my mother came to Sylvan,
met T. Ray and got married.

947
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,164
That's right.

948
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,325
But what I don't get
is why she married him.

949
01:25:50,203 --> 01:25:54,867
I think Deborah liked the fact
that he was decorated in the war.

950
01:25:54,975 --> 01:25:56,875
She thought he was brave.

951
01:25:56,977 --> 01:25:59,036
Said he treated her like a princess.

952
01:25:59,145 --> 01:26:01,739
It's not the same T. Ray.
I can tell you that right now.

953
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,442
You know, Lily,
people can start out one way...

954
01:26:07,554 --> 01:26:12,719
<i>and by the time life get through with 'em,
end up completely different.</i>

955
01:26:12,826 --> 01:26:16,922
<i>I mean, I don't doubt that he started off
lovin'her. Fact, he worshipped her.</i>

956
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:22,229
<i>But after about six months or so,
her love wore off.</i>

957
01:26:22,335 --> 01:26:24,599
But she married him?

958
01:26:24,704 --> 01:26:28,105
<i>But if the love had worn off,
why did she marry him?</i>

959
01:26:30,076 --> 01:26:33,568
Honey, Deborah was pregnant.

960
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,580
That's why.

961
01:26:42,455 --> 01:26:44,423
She called me
soon after you were born.

962
01:26:44,524 --> 01:26:48,426
<i>I got letters and phone calls,
mostly about you.</i>

963
01:26:48,528 --> 01:26:53,124
How you were sittin' up
and takin' your first steps.

964
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:55,667
<i>Playin'patty-cake.</i>

965
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:01,337
<i>But then the letters
start comin'less and less.</i>

966
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:04,001
And one day she called me up...

967
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:06,977
and she said she was leavin'T. Ray.

968
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,241
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

969
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:12,512
<i>When I picked her up
from the bus station...</i>

970
01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:14,519
<i>she didn't even look like herself.</i>

971
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,689
<i>She had gotten so thin.</i>

972
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:20,885
I was with her when you picked her up
from the bus station, right?

973
01:27:23,296 --> 01:27:25,230
<i>She brought me along, didn't she?</i>

974
01:27:28,668 --> 01:27:31,034
<i>No. She came by herself, honey.</i>

975
01:27:34,808 --> 01:27:37,538
<i>Why?</i>

976
01:27:37,644 --> 01:27:39,544
Why didn't she bring me?

977
01:27:41,848 --> 01:27:45,545
All I know, Lily,
is she was fallin' apart.

978
01:27:45,652 --> 01:27:47,552
Depressed people do things
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

979
01:27:47,654 --> 01:27:51,021
It was easy for her to leave me
'cause she never wanted me in the first place.

980
01:27:51,124 --> 01:27:53,024
Lily.

981
01:27:55,095 --> 01:27:57,928
<i>After she was here
for a few months...</i>

982
01:27:58,031 --> 01:28:01,728
and started feelin' better, she...
she start talkin' about how much she missed you.

983
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,900
Then she went back
to Sylvan to see you.

984
01:28:07,006 --> 01:28:09,600
She was just comin' for her things.

985
01:28:09,709 --> 01:28:13,509
- I believe she came back for you.
- I'm goin' to bed.

986
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:15,103
<i>Lily!</i>

987
01:28:15,215 --> 01:28:18,343
Now your mama
made a terrible mistake.

988
01:28:18,451 --> 01:28:20,351
But I believe she tried to fix it.

989
01:28:20,453 --> 01:28:22,353
Good night.

990
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:30,258
Damn it, Deborah.

991
01:28:43,543 --> 01:28:45,101
I hate you!

992
01:28:45,211 --> 01:28:47,805
I hate your guts!

993
01:29:06,599 --> 01:29:09,067
Why didn't you love me?

994
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:21,506
Tiburon.

995
01:30:25,278 --> 01:30:27,178
Lily.

996
01:30:30,984 --> 01:30:33,214
What in Mary's name happened here?

997
01:30:37,857 --> 01:30:39,757
Answer me.

998
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:49,724
T. Ray was right about my mother.

999
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:53,871
She left me.

1000
01:30:59,779 --> 01:31:02,441
<i>Hi.</i>

1001
01:31:02,549 --> 01:31:04,449
Hi.

1002
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:07,486
I brought some
of your mama's belongings.

1003
01:31:12,685 --> 01:31:16,883
It's just a handful of things your mama left
when she went back to get you.

1004
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:21,716
Been in this box...

1005
01:31:23,195 --> 01:31:25,390
10 years, I guess.

1006
01:31:27,767 --> 01:31:29,894
You really loved her.

1007
01:31:34,073 --> 01:31:37,474
It was complicated.
But, yes, I did.

1008
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:41,478
How was it complicated?

1009
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,912
I was her nanny.

1010
01:31:44,016 --> 01:31:47,247
Things were different
in her world than mine.

1011
01:31:49,955 --> 01:31:53,413
We like to think
that love is pure and limitless.

1012
01:31:53,526 --> 01:31:57,792
But love like that
can't exist in a hateful time.

1013
01:32:00,366 --> 01:32:03,199
But she made me love her anyway.

1014
01:32:06,038 --> 01:32:09,701
There is no perfect love, Lily.

1015
01:32:27,059 --> 01:32:29,391
Your mama's pocket mirror.

1016
01:32:31,063 --> 01:32:35,261
If you look in here,
you see your mama looking back at you.

1017
01:32:57,089 --> 01:32:59,023
Well, I'll be.

1018
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,728
She was wearin' that pin
the day she got here.

1019
01:33:25,351 --> 01:33:27,376
There's just one last thing.

1020
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:11,719
Hey.

1021
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:13,798
Hey.

1022
01:34:23,876 --> 01:34:25,969
- What happened to you?
- What about it?

1023
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:28,444
It changed you, didn't it?

1024
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:37,788
Sometimes, Lily, I...

1025
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:39,790
I get so angry.

1026
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,390
I just want to kill somethin'.

1027
01:34:43,495 --> 01:34:46,362
The men that took you...

1028
01:34:46,465 --> 01:34:48,865
they're angry like that too.

1029
01:34:48,968 --> 01:34:51,129
Makes 'em mean.

1030
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:55,964
You have to promise me, Zach,
that you won't be like them.

1031
01:34:56,075 --> 01:34:58,339
I don't want to.

1032
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,969
Me either.

1033
01:35:27,172 --> 01:35:30,005
No way I'm not
becomin' a lawyer now.

1034
01:35:31,844 --> 01:35:34,972
I'm gonna be one of them drum majors
Dr. King talks about.

1035
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:37,207
I know you will.

1036
01:35:37,316 --> 01:35:42,185
And... 10, maybe
15 years from now...

1037
01:35:43,455 --> 01:35:45,355
we'll be at your book signin'.

1038
01:36:03,575 --> 01:36:06,669
So don't forget our story, all right?

1039
01:36:08,647 --> 01:36:10,512
I won't.

1040
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:25,226
<i>I have you know I am now a registered voter.</i>

1041
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:27,525
- Really?
- I'll be castin' my vote for...

1042
01:36:27,633 --> 01:36:29,567
Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey.

1043
01:36:35,207 --> 01:36:37,368
I love you, Miss Rosaleen.

1044
01:36:51,690 --> 01:36:54,420
- Neil.
- Hello, ladies.

1045
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:14,576
Hi.

1046
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:17,547
Hi.

1047
01:37:17,649 --> 01:37:21,585
Didn't you call me here to talk?
I'm a little busy.

1048
01:37:21,687 --> 01:37:25,521
- You ain't the only one busy.
- I'm just supposed to stand here and watch how busy you are?

1049
01:37:25,624 --> 01:37:26,955
No.

1050
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,535
I was...

1051
01:37:41,607 --> 01:37:44,474
I was wonderin' if you'd be
willin' to ask again.

1052
01:37:44,576 --> 01:37:46,771
Ask what?

1053
01:37:50,182 --> 01:37:52,275
This supposed to be funny?

1054
01:38:02,394 --> 01:38:05,022
June Boatwright, will you marry me?

1055
01:38:09,902 --> 01:38:11,802
Yes.

1056
01:38:11,904 --> 01:38:13,997
Yes?

1057
01:38:15,274 --> 01:38:17,174
Yes? Yes?

1058
01:38:17,276 --> 01:38:19,904
Yes.

1059
01:38:23,649 --> 01:38:26,743
She said yes.

1060
01:38:26,852 --> 01:38:29,013
- Oh, my God.
- Good for you.

1061
01:38:29,121 --> 01:38:31,112
Come on. We're goin' to
the jewelry store right now...

1062
01:38:31,223 --> 01:38:33,384
pickin' out a ring before you
change your mind, all right?

1063
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:35,619
What? You don't already have one?

1064
01:38:35,727 --> 01:38:37,627
Girl, come on.

1065
01:38:37,729 --> 01:38:39,993
How come you don't have one?

1066
01:39:08,427 --> 01:39:11,885
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.

1067
01:39:14,733 --> 01:39:16,724
Won't you come in?

1068
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,271
<i>Well, all right, goddamn it.</i>

1069
01:39:25,377 --> 01:39:29,143
<i>You wanna pretend
I'm making a social visit, we'll pretend.</i>

1070
01:39:29,248 --> 01:39:32,046
I'm gonna take you out of here nice and quiet
or kickin' and screamin'.

1071
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:34,209
<i>Don't matter which one to me.</i>

1072
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:36,287
Have a seat if you want to.

1073
01:39:49,968 --> 01:39:51,993
So you been here the whole time?

1074
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:55,105
With colored women?

1075
01:39:55,207 --> 01:39:58,233
<i>- Jesus Christ.
- How'd you find me?</i>

1076
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,642
That map on your wall.

1077
01:40:03,749 --> 01:40:05,910
Came here, started askin' around.

1078
01:40:06,018 --> 01:40:10,284
Some old lady secretary at the law office
was more than happy to fill me in.

1079
01:40:13,759 --> 01:40:17,092
- Where's Rosaleen?
- She took off a long time ago.

1080
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:38,913
Where'd you get that?

1081
01:40:39,017 --> 01:40:41,315
- Miss August gave it to me.
- Don't you lie to me.

1082
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:44,321
I'm not lyin'.

1083
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:46,857
She said it belonged to my...

1084
01:40:50,095 --> 01:40:53,531
I gave that pin to your mama
on her 22nd birthday.

1085
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:58,298
Now you tell me right now.

1086
01:40:58,403 --> 01:41:01,065
- How'd this August woman get it?
- You gave this to my mother?

1087
01:41:01,173 --> 01:41:03,141
- Answer me.
- You did?

1088
01:41:05,744 --> 01:41:08,736
This is where my mother came
when she ran away from us.

1089
01:41:09,881 --> 01:41:12,076
She was wearin' it
the day she got here.

1090
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:26,055
Miss August used to take care of her
when she was a little girl.

1091
01:41:36,308 --> 01:41:39,038
I looked for her
everywhere I could think.

1092
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:43,080
And she was right here.

1093
01:41:44,616 --> 01:41:47,084
Jesus Christ, she was right here.

1094
01:41:59,631 --> 01:42:02,464
Goddamn you, Deborah!

1095
01:42:02,567 --> 01:42:04,432
You ain't leavin' me again!

1096
01:42:04,536 --> 01:42:06,401
Get back here!

1097
01:42:06,505 --> 01:42:08,700
T. Ray, it's me, Lily!

1098
01:42:08,807 --> 01:42:10,798
Daddy!

1099
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:29,351
You... You look like her.

1100
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:40,934
My whole life's
been nothin' but a hole...

1101
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:43,872
where my mother should've been.

1102
01:42:43,975 --> 01:42:46,170
It left me always achin'.

1103
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,475
But I never thought about
what it did to you.

1104
01:42:59,558 --> 01:43:02,152
- We're goin' home.
- I'm stayin' here.

1105
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:08,194
<i>You think I'm gonna
walk out ofhere and leave you?</i>

1106
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,291
I don't even know these damn people.

1107
01:43:10,402 --> 01:43:12,302
I know them.

1108
01:43:13,472 --> 01:43:15,599
And August Boatwright
is a good person.

1109
01:43:15,707 --> 01:43:18,437
<i>Now, what makes you think
she'd even want you here?</i>

1110
01:43:18,543 --> 01:43:21,774
Lily can have a home here
as long as she wants.

1111
01:43:25,183 --> 01:43:27,048
Lily said you'd run off.

1112
01:43:27,152 --> 01:43:29,552
Well, I guess I'm back now.

1113
01:43:29,654 --> 01:43:34,114
<i>Well, I don't really care
where you end up...</i>

1114
01:43:35,327 --> 01:43:37,261
but Lily's comin' with me.

1115
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:47,203
Everybody all right?

1116
01:43:48,773 --> 01:43:50,741
We all right.

1117
01:43:50,842 --> 01:43:52,867
This is Mr. Owens...

1118
01:43:52,978 --> 01:43:54,878
Lily's father.

1119
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:57,471
He came here for a visit.

1120
01:44:00,652 --> 01:44:03,052
<i>Mr. Owens...</i>

1121
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:08,091
you'd be doing Lily and us
a big favor by leavin' her here.

1122
01:44:08,193 --> 01:44:12,152
I made her my apprentice beekeeper.
She learnin' the whole business.

1123
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,065
We love Lily.

1124
01:44:18,837 --> 01:44:21,738
<i>We'll get her started in school.</i>

1125
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,173
We'll take care of her.
I promise you that.

1126
01:44:34,286 --> 01:44:36,345
Well...

1127
01:44:38,723 --> 01:44:40,623
good riddance.

1128
01:45:09,421 --> 01:45:12,117
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

1129
01:45:16,995 --> 01:45:20,931
The day my mother died, you said
she was only comin' back for her things.

1130
01:45:22,334 --> 01:45:24,461
Is that true?

1131
01:45:27,305 --> 01:45:29,205
No.

1132
01:45:30,642 --> 01:45:33,167
No. She was comin' for you.

1133
01:45:37,048 --> 01:45:39,141
Why did you lie?

1134
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,715
'Cause she didn't come for me.

1135
01:46:20,592 --> 01:46:24,585
<i>I still tell myself
that when T. Ray drove away that day...</i>

1136
01:46:24,696 --> 01:46:27,824
<i>he wasn't sayin: "Good riddance. "</i>

1137
01:46:27,932 --> 01:46:33,029
<i>He was sayin: "Lily, you are better off there
with all these mothers. "</i>

1138
01:46:34,406 --> 01:46:38,672
<i>I have more mothers than
any three girls off the street.</i>

1139
01:46:39,978 --> 01:46:42,173
<i>They are the moons
shinin'over me.</i>

1140
01:46:48,219 --> 01:46:50,449
<i>I guess I have forgiven myself.</i>

1141
01:46:50,555 --> 01:46:55,356
<i>Although sometimes in the night,
my dreams will take me back to sadness...</i>

1142
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:59,260
<i>and I have to wake up and forgive again.</i>

1143
01:46:59,364 --> 01:47:02,390
<i>But Mary is always there.</i>

1144
01:47:03,868 --> 01:47:06,336
<i>I feel her at unexpected moments.</i>

1145
01:47:07,706 --> 01:47:09,901
<i>She will suddenly rise.</i>

1146
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:14,843
<i>And when she does,
she does not go up into the sky...</i>

1147
01:47:14,946 --> 01:47:17,312
<i>but further inside of me.</i>

1148
01:48:15,673 --> 01:48:20,133
<i>If you think
the sky is falling</i>

1149
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:23,339
<i>Comin'undone</i>

1150
01:48:23,448 --> 01:48:25,006
<i>Hmm</i>

1151
01:48:25,116 --> 01:48:29,576
<i>All the pieces crumble</i>

1152
01:48:29,687 --> 01:48:32,323
<i>You're on the run</i>

1153
01:48:34,559 --> 01:48:39,189
<i>All the wrong you've taken</i>

1154
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:43,859
<i>All the rules
you're breakin'</i>

1155
01:48:43,968 --> 01:48:48,371
<i>Don't you know
the solid truth is</i>

1156
01:48:48,473 --> 01:48:50,907
<i>It comes back to you</i>

1157
01:48:51,009 --> 01:48:55,639
<i>Don't you know
the sky is blue</i>

1158
01:48:55,747 --> 01:49:00,377
<i>Can't you see the sun
is breakin'through</i>

1159
01:49:00,485 --> 01:49:04,979
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

1160
01:49:05,089 --> 01:49:10,527
<i>Don't you know
the sky is blue</i>

1161
01:49:10,628 --> 01:49:12,118
<i>Huh</i>

1162
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:16,792
<i>Every time you
walk out that door</i>

1163
01:49:16,901 --> 01:49:20,098
<i>Cursin'the sky</i>

1164
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:26,169
<i>Feelin'like
you've been cheated</i>

1165
01:49:26,277 --> 01:49:28,609
<i>Ripped from inside</i>

1166
01:49:28,713 --> 01:49:33,309
<i>Don't you know
the sky is blue</i>

1167
01:49:33,418 --> 01:49:38,048
<i>Can't you see the sun
is breakin'through</i>

1168
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:42,786
<i>Have a little faith in you</i>

1169
01:49:42,894 --> 01:49:47,854
<i>Don't you know
the sky is blue</i>

1170
01:49:47,966 --> 01:49:50,161
<i>Come on</i>

1171
01:49:50,268 --> 01:49:51,963
<i>Mmm</i>

1172
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:53,970
<i>Mmm</i>

1173
01:49:56,708 --> 01:49:58,608
<i>Mmm, yeah</i>

1174
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:03,773
<i>Now you know</i>

1175
01:50:03,882 --> 01:50:05,349
<i>Hmm</i>

1176
01:50:13,057 --> 01:50:14,957
<i>Uh</i>

1177
01:50:15,059 --> 01:50:18,392
<i>Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah</i>

1178

<i>Don't you know

01:50:55,767 --> 01:51:00,067
<i>Don't you know the sky is blue</i>

<i>Have a...

01:51:05,143 --> 01:51:09,341
<i>Don't you know

<i>Don't you know the sky is blue</i>

1185
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,217
<i>Hey</i>

1186
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,345
<i>Don't you know the sky</i>

1187
01:51:17,455 --> 01:51:19,355
<i>Sky</i>

1188
01:51:19,457 --> 01:51:21,755
<i>I'm telling you</i>

1189
01:51:21,859 --> 01:51:23,986
<i>The sky is blue</i>

1190
01:51:24,095 --> 01:51:27,963
<i>Believe it whoo-hoo</i>

1191
01:51:28,066 --> 01:51:30,557
<i>Don't you know the sky</i>

1192
01:51:30,668 --> 01:51:32,260
<i>Sky</i>

1193
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:33,928
<i>Sky</i>

1194
01:51:34,038 --> 01:51:36,836
<i>Sky</i>

1195
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:38,841
<i>Hey</i>

<i>Oh</i>

1201
01:52:03,768 --> 01:52:05,736
<i>Well, there's nothin'
you can do</i>

1202
01:52:05,837 --> 01:52:08,271
<i>Well, there's nothin'
you can say</i>

1203
01:52:08,373 --> 01:52:11,638
<i>'Cause everything just ain't
gonna go your way</i>

1204
01:52:11,743 --> 01:52:13,643
<i>If you're feeling
kind of strange</i>

1205
01:52:13,745 --> 01:52:16,145
<i>And you want to lay it down</i>

1206
01:52:16,247 --> 01:52:19,216
<i>And it's hard for you to keep
your feet on solid ground</i>

1207
01:52:19,317 --> 01:52:22,775
<i>- You gotta keep on

<i>- Keep, keep on

1214
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:49,771
<i>When a poor girl shine</i>

1215
01:52:49,881 --> 01:52:52,247
<i>And a rich girl cries</i>

1216
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:55,581
<i>And the clown is
wearin'no makeup</i>

1217
01:52:55,686 --> 01:52:57,620
<i>You got to get up and run</i>

1218
01:52:57,722 --> 01:52:59,656
<i>You got to get up and strive</i>
