1
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,346
<b>ALIENS IN THE ATTIC</b>

2
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,922
Oh, my God, Stewart?
- What is it?

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,216
Tom's grades finally posted.

4
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,055
Look!
- Wonderful!

5
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,557
Not one A!
- No.

6
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,142
Or B!
- Hm..huh!

7
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,852
Not even in Health?

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,065
What the..?
- It was a D.

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,775
How are these changing?

10
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,992
Utter one word and you're dead.

11
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,245
Are you crazy?

12
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,207
Dad catches you, he's gonna kill you.
- Dad's not gonna catch me.

13
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,503
I don't get it!
What you see in that guy?

14
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,213
Bye, babe!

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,923
You mean other than the fact that...

16
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,176
..he's good-looking, sweet, sensitive,
romantic, funny...

17
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,428
..and ridiculously athletic?

18
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,808
Dad's coming and he is mad.
- And who?

19
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,268
Tom!
- Tom?

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,315
What?

21
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,442
If you're so smart enough to hack into
the school's website...

22
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,402
..then you're smart enough to pass maths.

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,490
Do you think Bethany got accepted to Michigan
by screwing around all the time?

24
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,451
Of course not.
She got in because she's perfect.

25
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,578
No, your sister worked her tail-off.

26
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,330
And that's excatly what I expect from you.

27
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,292
Yeah, you're right, Dad.
I don't deserve a family vacation.

28
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,461
I should stay home tomorrow.
Learn my lesson.

29
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,713
Oh, no, no!
I'm not taking that bait, kiddo.

30
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,466
This isn't you.
The bad attitude, the grades...

31
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,593
What is going on?
- Nothing.

32
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,224
I blame all this, for coming between this,
right here.

33
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,352
A good old fashioned, no tech...

34
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,730
..family togetherness is exactly
what we needed.

35
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,818
So, get some sleep.
We're hitting the road at sun up.

36
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh, and you guys too.

37
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,549
Hannah!

38
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,218
Please next time, you ride the hump, okay?

39
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,220
I throw up in the hump,
remember?

40
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,032
<i>..and that's the final report.</i>

41
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,535
<i>In other news, it looks like there will be more
than just fireworks in the sky tonight...</i>

42
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>..as an unexcepted meteor shower
adds a little excitement..</i>

43
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,497
<i>..to our area this holiday.</i>

44
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,374
Sound's exciting!
We're going in for a real show.

45
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,170
It would be beautiful, guys.
- Better wear your hats, tonight.

46
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,464
Hope, you don't want to get your
heads on fire.

47
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,465


48
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,467


49
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,469


50
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,346


51
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,182
Wow!
Your boy toy is a complete idiot.

52
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,977
Ricky is not a boy toy.
We're in a true loving relationship.

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,395
Okay, why don't we talk in a few years,

54
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,105
..when you have a clue
what's dating all about.

55
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,524
Like, Ricky has a clue?

56
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,025
One more word about Ricky,

57
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,610
And I swear to God, I'll kill you.

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,863
Okay, that is enough!
Knock it off, you guys!

59
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,156
We're almost there.

60
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,301
And there is the pool.
Bye.

61
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,680
Leave me, Uncle Nate.
Oh, ya, haha!

62
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,851
I got it, Tom.
Don't worry!

63
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,144
Nice, huh?
- Nice, nice! I got that.

64
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,982
Hope, there's a discount for booking us into the
most boring spot in the whole country?

65
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,360
Come on! We're almost stone's throw away
from world's top-notch fishing lakes.

66
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,945
Oh, We got a time machine...

67
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,197
So we can go back 5 years,
when they thought fishing was cool?

68
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324
Hey, I bought us all whole new
side strap reels.

69
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,784
Anti-reverse technology.

70
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,121
Lame!

71
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,633
So lame!

72
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,543
Nice landing, Nate!

73
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,046
Told you, I could fish tail this thing.

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,507
Nice try, Nate!
But you just missed my kids.

75
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,051
But he did almost give your mother
a heart attack.

76
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,594
Again!

77
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,429
Nana!
- Hi, Mom.

78
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,264
Hi, hon.
- Nana!

79
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,141
Hey, sweetheart.

80
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,312
I got you a little treat.
- You did?

81
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,731
Yep, I did.
Here we go.

82
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,358
Thank you.

83
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,568
Oh, it's so good to see you.

84
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,153
Hey, we're here!
- I missed you.

85
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:48,283
Well, one of the Pearson brothers,
came to party.

86
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,285
Are those even legal here?
- No!

87
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,623
Come on, Stu!
Let's get him.

88
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,126
Nate, stop it! Hold on!.
- Get him! Get this bastard, Nate!

89
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,921
Take his shirt off.
- Mom?

90
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,258
Oh, Stu's crying for mommy-y-y!

91
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,766
Twins, in here.
- Hey, guys.

92
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,269
Put my bags on the bed.
- Sir! Yes, Sir!

93
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,397
Can I be the wise guy?
- No. Definitely not.

94
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,399
Don't provoke.
- Good.

95
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,900
Now, get these out of here.

96
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,152
Oh, wait a minute.
Why, you get the best room?

97
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,488
I was here first.
- I'm here now.

98
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,157
I'm older.
- But I'm bigger.

99
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,996
Did you grow up since Christmas?
- 2 inches, Coz!

100
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,790
I can tag a stop sign without even
having to jump.

101
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,171
And how's math fights?
- I don't do math fights anymore.

102
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,089
You tired of getting beat up?

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,259
Tom?
Get down here and help us unload.

104
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,760
Now!

105
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,346
Close the door on the way out.

106
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,824
Surprise, surprise, Princess!
- Ricky, what are you doing here?

107
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,701
I'm just stopping by to spend my afternoon.

108
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,703
Or may be the night!

109
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,380
What's that?
- What's what?

110
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:26,965
Ricky!

111
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,761
Hey, watch out for the car.
- I can't believe you're here.

112
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,554
Well, you're my girlfriend now.

113
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,556
So there's nothing,
I wouldn't do for you.

114
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,059
Give Papa some sugar.

115
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,521
Bethany!
Please, don't give Papa Sugar.

116
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:44,608
Mr. and Mrs. P!
- Ricky, wow!

117
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,151
- Hey, Ricky!
What a surprise.

118
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,569
I got you what a housewoman get.

119
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,696
Oh, that's so sweet.
Isn't he sweet?

120
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:52,241
Yes, they are beautiful.
- They are gorgeous.

121
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,951
Yeah, very patriotic too,
huh?

122
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,744
Let's stick these flags in some water
and see if they grow.

123
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,620
Yeah, we can do that.

124
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,330
Hey, do you want anything to eat
or drink?

125
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,834
Oh, that is so sweet of you!
I..And I really wish I could...

126
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,961
But my parents are in a lakehouse
in Oakstown and...

127
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,214
I got to get back before dark,
incase my car breaks down again.

128
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:11,718
Oh ho! Car trouble.
- Dad, why don't you look at it for Ricky?

129
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,470
I don't mind getting my hands dirty.

130
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,055
Try it again, Ricky.

131
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,558
That would be some obvious, Dad.

132
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,894
I gotta be honest with you,
auto mechanics isn't really my thing.

133
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,815
Now, if this was a spreadsheet or a ledger,
I would be all over it.

134
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,817
Tell you what, Ricky.
Why shouldn't you stay here, tonight?

135
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,819
And will take your car to the shop
in the morning?

136
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,613
Mr. P! That's really considerate of you.
- Well..

137
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,117
Really? He can stay, tonight?
- Yeah, in the den. On the couch.

138
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,160
Of course!
- Don't fool around.

139
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,161
Dad!

140
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,038
What a gaspipe!

141
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,583
I know!
Why can't they see that?

142
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,668
Oh, dude!
Parents are wired coupling.

143
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,628
Their brains are old.
Machines.

144
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,797
Fried from bad 80's music.

145
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,382
So, it's upto you, Thomas.

146
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,259
You got to defend your family honor.

147
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,052
Like a man.

148
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,347
I call it
'The Punisher'.

149
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,350
Your dad bought you this?
- Perks of divorce.

150
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,437
Never underestimate the power of
a grown man's guilt.

151
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,523
If we even mention mom,
he drives us straight to the mall.

152
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,069
This is all yours.
Don't be a...all your life.

153
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,947
I don't know, man.

154
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,160
Take a look at that guy.

155
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,704
Do you really want Ricky as your
brother-in-law?

156
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,294
Heck, no!

157
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,588
Then let's go trim the family tree.

158
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,592
It's much fun out here, Ricky?

159
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,427
Oh, yeah!

160
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,763
You know, it's just the beginning.

161
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,391
Wow, the sun off the water...

162
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,021
And this cotton..is so...

163
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:49,608
..restricting!
- I hate cotton.

164
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,779
Mind helping me with the lotion, babe?

165
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,578
I think, shooting my sister's boyfriend,
isn't the best idea.

166
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,581
This isn't about ideas,
this is about action.

167
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,959
Don't think.
Do!

168
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,919
I can't beleive, even,
I'm listening to you.

169
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,337
You're dressed like a shrub!

170
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:14,383
Now, spread on my chest.
- Target is on the move.

171
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,009
Hit it now, before he reaches second base.

172
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,594
No, I don't think...

173
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,812
Why did you that?
- Cover! You'll compromise our position.

174
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,691
Oh, my God!
She saw us.

175
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,234
What do we do?
What do we do?

176
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,946
Don't look.
Head down and lie hidden.

177
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,285
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- You shot my boyfriend.

178
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,120
Sorry, don't even touch that.

179
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:43,954
When, Tom?

180
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,790
When you're gonna grow up and stop
being an total embarrassment?

181
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,962
And that's why we use camouflage.
- Shut up, Jake.

182
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,594
I don't know, what were you thinking.
I really don't!

183
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,679
Yeah, I'll be alrite.
- A paintball gun?

184
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,514
Don't you know that it's a gateway gun?

185
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,809
Come on, what's next?
B..? Pellet? Stun?

186
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,352
What..
What I'm gonna do?

187
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,062
What do you think I should do?
I don't know, what to do!

188
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,273
Can't you keep him in his room
for rest of the week?

189
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,983
But, it wasn't even me.
- Okay, Okay.

190
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,985
Look! You boys are just lucky that
Ricky was't badly hurt.

191
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,654
It's okay, Mr. P.
I was little kid once too.

192
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,781
Oh, that's nice, Ricky.
Thank you.

193
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,700
He's a good guy.
He's a good type.

194
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,493
But, I'm not okay with this.

195
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,786
We are here to fish.

196
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,413
Not to hunt your sister's boyfriend, alrite!

197
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,500
You could have put his eye out,
would that have been funny?

198
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,002
I don't think so.

199
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,254
Let's start off with a clean slate.

200
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,340
Tomorrow, we fish.

201
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,259
7.a.m, sharp!
- 7?

202
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,677
You're kidding.
- Pass.

203
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,970
Nate?
- Yeah, Stu.

204
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,972
Don't you think that's a little too early?

205
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,182
How about this?

206
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,601
10.a.m on the boat.
No questions asked!

207
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,103
Way to crack it, Nate.
Way to crack it.

208
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,113
Oh, Stu?
Stu?

209
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:05,369
Baby, the TV's all haywired.
- Stu, TV's got haywired.

210
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,664
Mom! Mom! Stop it.
It's probably the dish.

211
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,791
Right after the storm, I will climb up
on the roof and fix it.

212
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,794
Hey, wait a sec, Mr. P.
Let me fix this, man.

213
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,921
That's the least,
I can do for your hospitality.

214
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,549
No Ricky, you're hurt.
- Oh, no, it's just a graze.

215
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:19,967
- No. No, honey!
He's fine!

216
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,636
Go ahead, Richard.
Show some muscle.

217
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,014
- Yes, indeed!
But I'll be needing a helping hand.

218
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,725
What do you say, brother?

219
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,270
Here's a chance to bury the old hatchet.

220
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,900
Make things alrite with Ricky,
or don't come off that roof.

221
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,996
L-l-ladies first.

222
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,380
Wow!
It's all a creep show.

223
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,386
Alrite.
Here we go.

224
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,306
Listen, about the paintball thing...
- Oh, hey!

225
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,392
Don't worry about it.

226
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,978
Firecracker!
Too slow.

227
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,106
You know, what?
Thanks to your little...

228
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,525
..sharp shooting stunt. I wrapped up
pretty points with your parents.

229
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,361
And your sister's just itching to be
my private nurse.

230
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,866
So thanks a ton, ace.
That was a textbook maneuver.

231
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:27,993
Come on, quit stalling.

232
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,162
Get your butt up there and
make me your Nana's hero.

233
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,623
But you told my Dad,
you would fix it.

234
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,708
Oh, I told your Dad a lot of things.

235
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,293
Like, my car broke down...

236
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:38,754
My parents are on a lakehouse...

237
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,547
I'm 18...

238
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,675
You're not a senior?

239
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,637
Not in high school.

240
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,639
Now, go.

241
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,227
Go.

242
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,941
Hello?

243
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,911
Hello?

244
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,336
Dude, you made it too easy.
- It's not funny.

245
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,964
What the heck happened to the dish?

246
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,341
I can't do a week here,
without TV.

247
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,552
I can't do a week here.
Period.

248
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,776
Hello, humans!

249
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,904
Please tell me, you see that too.

250
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,240
Not sure want to, but yeah.
- We come from up...

251
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,950
Wow, wow!
Wow!

252
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:34,578
I handle human contact.
- Yes, Sir. Noted.

253
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,329
Yes, I understand.

254
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,914
Hello, humans!

255
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,376
No need to notification army.
We come in pieces!

256
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,753
In peace.
- What?

257
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,463
Say with me..'Peace-e-e'
- What are you talking about?

258
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,381
Stupid book!
Forget the book!

259
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,217
Attack the humans!
Attack!

260
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,010
With pleasure.

261
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,262
Humans!
Submit.

262
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,017
Hey, what is it, you girls took so long?
- No! No, lookout!

263
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,937
Ricky!

264
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:04,066
What's happening to him?
- Now the fun begins.

265
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,402
Testing, Testing!
Testing...

266
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,240
Testing.

267
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:17,621
Insignificant subjects!
We are the Zirconian species.

268
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,542
And we hereby claim your lushious planet
as our own.

269
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,835
What?
- What?

270
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,630
You have the choice of turning
into slaves or...

271
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,468
..instantaneous death.

272
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,470
Run?
- I'm good for run.

273
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,641
You have chosen instantaneous death.

274
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,852
The human corrupts are escaping.
- It's locked.

275
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,019
Not from me.

276
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,150
Which way?

277
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,569
Duck!

278
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,077
Unbelievable!

279
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,873
Razor, go.
- Yes, Sir!

280
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,172
Hey, can I play too?
- Hey, Han! Thank God.

281
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,339
Open!

282
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,467
Hurry!

283
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,680
Creepy-crawly!
- No, no, no..come back!

284
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,681
Come back!

285
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,058
Get down.
- Get down.

286
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,186
Hey, frog face.

287
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,399
What's up with all the noise?

288
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,276
Open the window.

289
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,361
Open it.
- You open it.

290
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,237
No, you open it.

291
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,655
Hurry!
- Get them.

292
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,991
Someone open it.

293
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,076
Come on, right there.

294
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:40,787
Hurry up!

295
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:42,998
Move, twins.

296
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,086
Everybody downstairs!
Now!

297
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,172
What?
- Just move.

298
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,139
Creepy-crawly!

299
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,266
Creepy...
- Go, go, go..go!

300
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,602
Down!
Down!

301
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,816
Move, move!
- Hurry up!

302
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,533
Grace Commander, be careful.
- What's wrong with this?

303
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:18,617
What's wrong with this?

304
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:19,910
Be careful.
- Fix it.

305
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,912
I will.
This is very, very...

306
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,331
You're a zombie?
- No.

307
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,333
You?
- No.

308
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,336
Prove it.
- What do you mean?

309
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:32,339
I mean, prove it.
- You wet the bed until you were 10.

310
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,258
A zombie wouldn't know it.
- Here, they come!

311
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,676
Look out!
- Ugly human.

312
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:37,135
Take the rope.

313
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:41,682
Tom, tie it off.
- I'm trying, push harder.

314
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,142
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

315
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,061
She scratched him with her claw.

316
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,689
Get off, sucker.

317
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,941
Wow, you cut off her nails.

318
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,901
We got to call 911.

319
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,369
I can't get a signal.
- Neither can I.

320
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,079
Mine's dead too.

321
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,541
These midget Martians must..us.

322
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,209
Never a good sign.

323
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,211
It's working.

324
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,132
There's no buttons.
What is this thing?

325
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,301
It's a rotary phone.
You see that?

326
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,269
What happened up there?

327
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,979
Was 'Get them' not clear enough?

328
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,315
Someone was obviously distracted.

329
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,567
I was following the plan.

330
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,819
You were playing with your little toy.

331
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,279
This is a deadly weapon.
- No.

332
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,072
It is!
- These are deadly weapons.

333
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,365
Listen all yourself!

334
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,868
This is why we lost success on
our mission previous.

335
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,704
Not looking to blame through,
but that was Razor's fault.

336
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,373
What? You with...
- If we loose success this time...

337
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,083
I loose my command.

338
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,085
Now, you going to learn to work together...

339
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,339
..or we'll together end up shovelling manure
back in Sector-7.

340
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:59,259
We won't let you down, Sir.
Let's go and slave some humans.

341
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,595
Oh, actually, about that...

342
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,264
I'm sure, enslaving is funny but...

343
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:05,974
But why the humans?
- What?

344
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,143
They don't seem that bad.
- Oh, poor kid!

345
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,270
Oh, they don't seem that bad?

346
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,523
Funny, that's what our engineer previous said.

347
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:13,690
Engineer previous?

348
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,527
Right before that creature that was
'not that bad'...

349
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,111
..ate him!

350
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,950
Humans are vicious.
Peace is not an option.

351
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:29,915
Sheriff, here.

352
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,625
There's an alien invasion in our rented house.

353
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,918
Knee-high beings, very violent!

354
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,004
Knee-high? What like..a hobbit?
- No. Real.

355
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,423
Look, I know it sounds crazy but
you gotta understand...

356
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,133
Okay, yeah, listen son!

357
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,387
You do know that making a forgery complaint
is a federal offense?

358
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,265
Is punishable...
- Hello?

359
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,395
Decent technique...
for a female.

360
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,022
How's that technique?

361
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,732
Hello?

362
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,527
We gotta tell our parents.

363
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,012
You think, he's still an alien zombie?

364
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:32,186
You are useless.

365
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,730
Why aren't my mind control plugs working?

366
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,940
You are the engineer,
figure it out.

367
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,233
Hurry up! Hurry up!

368
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,235
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Fix it.

369
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,279
He's not talking to us, right?
- Fix it, you idiot.

370
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,657
I think, he's picking up their conversation...

371
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,825
..there, like a bluetooth.

372
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,996
Are you telling me that the plugs only
work on mature subjects?

373
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,749
Why did we not plan for this?
You have failed me.

374
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:55,459
Your incompetent piece of...

375
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,753
'Translation not available'

376
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,298
These humans will pay.

377
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,430
Did you hear that?
- Yeah, sounds like Ricky landed on space.

378
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,140
No, those things they shot at us.

379
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,725
They..they are mind control plugs.

380
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:13,602
They won't work on kids.

381
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,312
It's like you said,
we're wired different.

382
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,396
What...
What about Ricky?

383
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,981
They..him and he's Bethany's age.

384
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,691
Look, he lied.
The fool's in college.

385
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,861
So, if their plugs don't work on kids..
- That means we're safe!

386
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,406
It means we can fight.
- It means, they'll go after our parents.

387
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:28,951
They are walking targets.
- We gotta tell them. Now!

388
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,161
Wow! Wow! Wait!
Think.

389
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:35,082
If our parents even go near those things,
they'll  get zapped and are zombies.

390
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,709
Our own parents will attack us.
- We need the police.

391
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,963
And a hard-core firepower.
- Armed zombies, even better!

392
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,381
We are done.
- Game over.

393
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:45,759
Game over for the grown-ups.
But we can still fight back.

394
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,512
Do you expect to stop an alien invasion
on our own?

395
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,098
He's right.
We are the only option.

396
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,975
But we can't tell anyone.

397
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:56,770
No police, no parents,
no exceptions, go it?

398
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,647
Hannah?

399
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,568
They are up in the attic.
Right now! Little aliens!

400
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,780
They are loud, and scary,
and really mean.

401
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:11,910
Han, there's no such things as aliens.
- Yes, there is. I saw them.

402
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:14,997
They smashed the skylight and tried
to break the attic stairs.

403
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,707
Well, let's hope not,
for your sake.

404
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,500
We put a huge deposit on this place.

405
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,627
You boys, better keep it in one piece.

406
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,379
You heard her, Tom.
No more trouble.

407
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,506
It was just a video game.
We shouldn't have let her watch.

408
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,508
It was pretty creepy!
- Yeah! Yeah!

409
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,721
Tommy, I'm scared.
I don't like the mean aliens.

410
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,016
Don't worry, Hannah.
Just pretend it's a big game.

411
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,936
A game, we all gonna win.
Just think about how little they're.

412
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,689
Little and deadly.
- What we do now?

413
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,065
We figure out the weakness.

414
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:45,152
They flew here from other galaxy,
you really think they have a weakness?

415
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,696
First rule of the warrior code...

416
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,157
'All enemies have a weakness.'

417
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,744
Sparks!
Why isn't my locator map up and running?

418
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,413
I told you,
I need parts to repair it.

419
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:05,047
Aha, even on Earth,
the male is dominant.

420
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:11,011
Wait...
- But the female always wins.

421
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:16,183
What the...?
By thy rings of Zirkon.

422
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,145
Makes no sense.
- They were fighting...

423
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,272
Now their lips are hugging?

424
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,815
I would never...
- Never.

425
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:24,691
Never-r-r!

426
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,904
Oh, I'm sorry, can I get you anything?
Cold drinks or snacks?

427
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,448
Or would you rather help me
invade the planet?

428
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,161
Alrite, here comes my specialty.

429
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:37,746
I'm going up.

430
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,965
I'm coming with you.
- Tom, be careful.

431
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,095
Enemy...

432
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,888
..apprehended.

433
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,976
I'll interrogate here.

434
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:07,359
Disgusting.
- What? Seriously, what?

435
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:11,196
Locator activated, Sir.
- Excellent! Target the objective.

436
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:14,366
Zoom in!
Zoom-m-m!

437
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,618
Zoom-m-m!
Zoom!

438
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,622
Zoom, zoom...
- You don't have to keep saying zoom.

439
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,457
Zoom..eh...

440
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:26,503
..and rotate.
- They're after something in the house.

441
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,130
Keep rotating
- Good...

442
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,257
I'm going in for a look.
- Stop.

443
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,093
Rotate, rotate...

444
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,095
Ah...
the basement!

445
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,680
Tom, help me!

446
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,561
That must have hurt.

447
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,273
Basement.
We gotta get to the basement.

448
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,233
Ricky?

449
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,319
Ricky?

450
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,614
Hey guys, wait!
Have you guys seen Ricky?

451
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,575
Pretty sure he's still hanging around here,
somewhere.

452
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,452
Actually, Beth...
- He didn't leave, did he?

453
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,162
No! No!
He...

454
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,289
He told us,
he was heading back to the lake.

455
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,875
..to bronze up his rock-hard abs.

456
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,335
Hey, he wants you to meet him there.

457
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,794
Wait.

458
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,880
What you guys were talking on the roof?

459
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,634
Did he say anything about me?
- No. No! He...

460
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,595
He talked about his car and...

461
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,472
Pretty much his..his car.

462
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,725
But you should hit the lake, so...
- Yeah, the lake.

463
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,727
Over there.
- The lake's over there.

464
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,733
I'm telling you,
their map led down here.

465
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,903
You positive?
- Shh, you hear that?

466
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,030
Rice krispies!

467
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,796
What is that?

468
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,259
It's them.

469
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,764
Something down here is setting it off.

470
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,695
Well, whatever it is,
we can't let them get to it.

471
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,613
Everyone, gear up!

472
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,032
We move on my command.
- Wait, just hold on.

473
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,745
If we run up there with a bunch of random
gonna get creamed.

474
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:26,373
We can make something better.
- We are in the middle of a battle...

475
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,083
..and you wanna play science fair?

476
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,502
No way!
We're going back in, now!

477
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,046
Before our parents end up as alien zombies.

478
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,591
You're not thinking.
We need a plan.

479
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,718
I already have a great idea for a weapon.

480
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,845
Yeah?
Let's go.

481
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,056
Now!

482
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,856
Hannah, hand me that tape.

483
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:53,609
What's up, Nate?
- Hey, guys.

484
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,194
Who wants a treat?

485
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,240
Huh, that's a lot of tools to,
try to fix a TV.

486
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:14,546
They are passing through!

487
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,256
Warrior Code says
'Strike first'.

488
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,091
Art, cover me.

489
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,801
With the rake?

490
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,020
How do you feel now?

491
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,105
Suckers!

492
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,483
Mission accomplished.

493
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,076
Oh, Christ.

494
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,580
It's a...

495
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,751
What the...!

496
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:55,587
What's happening?
- Why are we floating?

497
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,841
They turned off the gravity,
like in Halo.

498
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,051
This isn't Xbox, Lee
It's real.

499
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,344
Like Wii!

500
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,764
Now, what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

501
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:07,933
Stay behind me.

502
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:12,604
Go! Go! Go!
- Go, it's not okay...

503
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,069
Hello, humans!

504
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,280
Enjoying the ride?

505
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,411
They have gravity boots.
- Why don't we have gravity boots?

506
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:28,829
Yeah, gravity boots...

507
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,206
The door!
Stop them.

508
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,708
Use your weapon, Tom.

509
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,835
Bring it to me, sack.
- Today!

510
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,923
A potato gun?
That's your big idea?

511
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,302
My plan is working.
- My plan. You mean, my plan.

512
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,472
Hurry, Tommy.

513
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,452
You okay?
- I'm fine.

514
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,370
The door?
- On it.

515
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,498
Jake, get the grenade.

516
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,795
Hurry!

517
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,551
Quick!
Toss it here.

518
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,889
What?

519
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,478
Sweet monkey.

520
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,148
You little...

521
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,734
Go. Stand back.
- Shoot them.

522
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,238
Shoot them.
- Go! Go!

523
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,239
Shoot them.

524
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,325
Huh!
Alrite, tough guy.

525
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,868
What a gun fire.

526
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,456
Wow, that's the thing,
he used to control Ricky.

527
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,708
Wow!

528
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,461
Wow, Cool.
Let me see it.

529
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,171
Nice action on the toggles.

530
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,383
What are these..?
- Give it back.

531
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,843
Let me see.

532
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:07,135
I picked it up first.

533
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,137
Give it back.
- Lee!

534
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,140
Hey..hey guys, this is not a toy.
It's real.

535
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,940
Ricky?
- Yep.

536
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,568
Get him before somebody finds him.
I'll stand and alien watch.

537
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,403


538
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:26,405
s

539
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:28,365
s

540
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,367
s

541
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,747
I'm sure that will buff right out.
- Just a little.

542
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,542
Wonder, where he went?
- Oh, I'll find him.

543
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:44,590
Wow!

544
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,348
Cool, so these move him.
And these...

545
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,268
..rotate the arms.

546
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,482
Talk about the ultimate gameboy!

547
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:09,823
Do the big button, dude.

548
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,371
Wow-w-w!

549
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,290
What the...?

550
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:19,958
My Car-r-r!

551
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,669
That would be the on or off button.

552
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,173
Press again.

553
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:32,429
Who did this to my car?
- You did, you giant idiot.

554
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,015
Ricky!

555
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,519
Where have you been?

556
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,897
Oh, shut up, you little...
Bethany?

557
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,190
What?

558
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:47,069
Why are you hitting me?
- Why are you being just a jerk?

559
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,196
Huh?
- Revenge is so sweet.

560
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,198
I just spent the last hour walking
around the lake.

561
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,616
Where were you?

562
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:57,329
I thought so.
- No, I don't know.

563
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,039
Want me to bring him back?

564
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,250
Hey, what's the matter with you?
- You just...

565
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,543
Let him suffer.

566
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,262
Where's Ricky?

567
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,598
Taken prisoner by the aliens?
- No, worse...

568
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:17,891
..my sister.

569
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,979
Any action up here?

570
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,147
It's been quiet.

571
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,983
Too quiet.

572
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,570
Got it?

573
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:32,406
Got it?
- Yes, Sir.

574
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:34,366
What are they doing in the vents?

575
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,493
Their map!
That's how they get to the basement.

576
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,287
What do we do?

577
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,878
Hope this works, Einstein.

578
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,048
I'm getting get to thank you for pulling me
back to safety back there.

579
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,884
Because I didn't need you to.

580
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:54,428
Oh, that doesn't make sense.
- I don't like you.

581
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,722
Cut the crap up.
- Okay.

582
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,437
I'm sweating?

583
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,691
It's hot.

584
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:10,569
Hotter...
- Run.

585
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:14,239
Run!
Fall back! Fall back!

586
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,203
Sounds like...

587
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:21,747
Nice job.
I think it's working.

588
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:23,999
Kids! Get down here,
right now.

589
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,337
Who turned on the heat?

590
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,256
I did.
We need that on.

591
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,967
Are you crazy? It's July!
- Yeah, but it's freezing here.

592
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,094
Oh, yeah, Arctic.

593
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,597
I think, Han is coming down with something.

594
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,519
Han, what's going on?
- We are fighting aliens.

595
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,938
I'm pretending it to pretend.

596
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,065
I mean,
I just pretend.

597
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,234
Okay, but I'm not pretending.
So...

598
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:51,944
..don't touch the thermostat.

599
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,531
Tom, I'm not playing around.
- Neither, am I.

600
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:56,824
Tom, I'm not kidding.

601
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,408
You wanna spend the rest of the week
in your room?

602
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,994
Why not just trust that there's a reason
on doing this?

603
00:36:01,078 --> 00:36:02,788
A reason you're blasting the furnace
on summer vacation?

604
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:03,539
Yes!

605
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:05,249
A reason why you shot your sister's boyfriend?
- Yes!

606
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,668
A reason why you're taking back,
giving me attitude?

607
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,419
Failing your classes?

608
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:11,839
So that's, this is about?

609
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,424
I failed them on purpose.

610
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,010
Yeah, I changed my grades, okay?

611
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:19,555
I'm tired of getting picked on because
I'm a brainiac.

612
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,098
I was brainiac,
it worked for me.

613
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,350
I don't wanna be like you!
I wanna be cool.

614
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,984
Don't touch the thermostat.

615
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,657
Are you sure?
Really failed on purpose?

616
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,784
Nobody likes a mathlete.

617
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:44,204
Man, we can't fight these things with
our parents around.

618
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,747
We can't just get rid of them.

619
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,000
Maybe we can.

620
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,502
Here's what I want you to do.

621
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,009
Send it.

622
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,387
I hate it, when we fight.

623
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:02,931
I can't fight someone as cute as you.

624
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,683
Well, I'm glad we made up.

625
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:07,436
Well, it's not official to make-up
without a make-up kiss.

626
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,229
Are you serious?
My family is up there.

627
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,356
And your family is crazy about me.

628
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,901
And what about you?
- Well, you know I like you.

629
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,153
And we have all the summer ahead of us.

630
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,530
May be we don't need to go so fast.

631
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:20,407
What?

632
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:21,575
What?

633
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:28,957
Is that a no?

634
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,335
Ricky!

635
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,213
Ricky!

636
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:37,966
Careful!
Don't break him.

637
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,385
Ricky!
- Let him have his shirt.

638
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:41,803
Ricky!

639
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,183
Still no sign of them.

640
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,980
Where are they?
- Two options!

641
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,441
We are dealing with a retreat...

642
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,151
..or a surprise attack.

643
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:05,869
Surprise attack!

644
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:12,584
Hey!

645
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,336
Where's Tom?
I thought he's gonna help you.

646
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,755
So did I.
- Bad news!

647
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,424
The leasing office called.

648
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,386
They need you to go back there before
they close for the holidays.

649
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:24,513
Really?
- Problem with the contract.

650
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:26,431
They insisted.

651
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:29,852
Ricky, are you okay?

652
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:32,604
Oh, umm, ahh...

653
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,399
Just allergies, Mr. P.
- Just allergies, Mr. P.

654
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,234
But they did say it's urgent.

655
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,110
Urgent?

656
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,529
Okay. I'll call and
I will resolve this out.

657
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:42,406
That's so weird.

658
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,245
Oh, this is weird, Stu.

659
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:50,998
I think the phone is dead.

660
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:55,085
They just cut off our power?

661
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,504
Oh, they're gonna hear about it from me.
Let's go!

662
00:38:57,629 --> 00:39:00,591
And we're going down there, right now.
- Hey, guys...

663
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,843
We could use some more beers
and chips...

664
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,095
Why don't you run up the grocery store?
I'll fire up the grill.

665
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,307
And watch the kids?
- Okay, whatever.

666
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:09,641
No!
- No!

667
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:14,354
I mean, you all have to go.
They...

668
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:17,441
They said that all your names are on the list.

669
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:21,361
I'll look after the kids.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

670
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,072
Well, I guess I could drive.

671
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:27,242
Okay, okay.
- Oh, and Mr. P...

672
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,370
..while you're out,
can you get me some adult diapers?

673
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:33,040
Mine are almost full...

674
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,044
That is a bad allergy.

675
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,546
Superabsorbent!

676
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,091
Look!

677
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,010
Alien death gas.

678
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,553
Don't breathe.

679
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,846
Put him on pause.

680
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,478
Happy 4th of July, space maggots.

681
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:56,730
Jake, there's smoke in the vents.

682
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,481
It's me.

683
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,649
We heard these things on the move,

684
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,150
I'm tracking them down
and heading them off.

685
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,443
Thanks.
- Parents?

686
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,695
Gone!
- Thanks.

687
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:06,031
Now, we can take it up to next.

688
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:12,621
This could get ugly.

689
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,914
Hannah!
Go hide.

690
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,374
Yes
- Me...

691
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,834
Not you.

692
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,340
Incoming!
- Move..move! Go!

693
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,510
Sayonara, suckers.

694
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:30,013
Oh...
- Crap.

695
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:36,603
Go! Keep moving.
- Keep moving.

696
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,605
Go! Go! Go!
Go back.

697
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,858
Go back!
We'll have to go back.

698
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,195
Now, I'm starting to see why
the last engineer...

699
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,626
I see, you booby trapped your room.

700
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,296
I got it, got it...
No, don't got it.

701
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:17,883
Genius human snare...

702
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:32,523
Oh, Wow!
I thought I was clumsy.

703
00:41:35,818 --> 00:41:38,654
It's okay, don't worry.
- We come in peace...

704
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:40,906
It's okay,
I'll help you.

705
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:46,037
Don't worry.
It's okay.

706
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,752
Oh, you got to.
Don't move.

707
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,596
Okay?
- Thank you.

708
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:08,684
Tazer. Razor.
Sparks..!

709
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:09,977
Sparks...?

710
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,522
He's critical to the mission.

711
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,070
Nice sounds.
- It's music.

712
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,324
Music. I try?
- Sure.

713
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,396
That definitely slowed them down,
but those buggers adapt fast.

714
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:55,981
We need to pull up big guns.

715
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,654
Black cat whistler or Fire Dragon?

716
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:04,824
How about not burning down the house?

717
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,375
He's armed...
Enemy armed.

718
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,044
Hannah, step away from the alien.

719
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:19,046
No!

720
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,675
No. Leave him alone.
He is my friend.

721
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,510
He was just holding a raygun to your head.

722
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,596
It's my bubble blower.
He fixed it for me.

723
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:29,432
He is not like the others.

724
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:30,683
Look!

725
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:35,020
First sign of aggression,
I'm taking him down.

726
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:38,357
..with extreme prejudice.
- I don't have training for this.

727
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,901
No training...
- It's okay, Mr. Snugglelump.

728
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,280
Snugglelump?
- Yeah, that's what I named him.

729
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,532
My name is Sparks.
- He's not your pet, Hannah.

730
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,242
He's a freaking alien.

731
00:43:48,743 --> 00:43:50,036
He's my alien.

732
00:43:51,954 --> 00:43:53,247
Hi..

733
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:55,374
Oooh!

734
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,002
I mean..Oh!

735
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:02,089
Maybe she's right.
I mean, look at his belt...

736
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:03,799
It holds only tools.

737
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:08,596
It's okay, buddy.
We just want to talk to you.

738
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:09,972
Come on, Snuggs.

739
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,141
Back off.

740
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:30,910
Watch!

741
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:40,461
Awesome.
How does he do that?

742
00:44:59,688 --> 00:45:01,273
What the heck was that?

743
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,818
Talking about feelings comes as a territory
when you have a girlfriend.

744
00:45:03,943 --> 00:45:05,653
You know, there's no need to fall for that one.

745
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,115
Okay!
Okay, I get it.

746
00:45:09,115 --> 00:45:10,700
I'm here to talk and
I'm yelling.

747
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:13,703
I'm sorry, it's...
amateurish to shout.

748
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:20,126
Look, I'm so..
so happy being your girlfriend.

749
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,587
But if you really care about me,
the way that I care about you.

750
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:27,091
Then it shouldn't be a problem to give
me the time that I need.

751
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:30,678
May be you should think about it.

752
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:32,805
I respect guys like that, okay?

753
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,266
Take all the time that you want.

754
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,560
I'll be here...

755
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,853
..ready to talk.

756
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,733
With you.

757
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,157
So, that's how it is?

758
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:52,950
I'm getting the silent treatment?

759
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,578
Well, who is in high school now?

760
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:02,084
Why are you trying to kill us?

761
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:03,669
What's the invasion plan?

762
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:05,379
What is your weakness?
- Water?

763
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:06,797
Earthworms?
- Women?

764
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:09,341
Are there more of you coming?
- We need the information.

765
00:46:09,884 --> 00:46:13,554
Guys, don't be mean...
- Hannah, we have to interrogate him.

766
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:16,557
Do you want the world to end?
Do you?

767
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:19,477
No...

768
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,233
Wow-w-w!

769
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:29,195
House, here.
Mission objective, here.

770
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:31,030
What you're after isn't in the basement!

771
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,740
It's under the basement.
- Yes.

772
00:46:32,782 --> 00:46:34,784
What are you trying to steal from
our planet?

773
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:36,202
This isn't from our planet.

774
00:46:36,577 --> 00:46:38,162
Look at that thing, looks alien to me.

775
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:39,789
It must be from their planet.

776
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:42,708
Yeah!
Planet Fruit Cake.

777
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,795
Whatever it is, it's huge.

778
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,803
Almost done.

779
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,557
So that's what in the capsule.

780
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,519
Some kind of giant machine?

781
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:04,188
Oh, great!
A giant alien death machine.

782
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,274
No one said anything about death.
- Yeah, well, I doubt it's a photo-copier.

783
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:09,652
Come on.
We can't trust this four armed freak.

784
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,029
He's one of them.
- He's not.

785
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,991
This guy doesn't fit in with the others.

786
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:22,248
He is...

787
00:47:22,832 --> 00:47:24,333
..different.

788
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,460
Great!
A geek alien.

789
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:28,921
Jake, he is not a geek.

790
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,465
It's better than a killer alien.

791
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:56,824
Buenas noches, wrinkles.

792
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,082
Oh, this is ridiculous.

793
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:11,505
Well, this sucks.

794
00:48:17,636 --> 00:48:19,221
Modified!
- Wow!

795
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,392
Sweet.

796
00:48:24,977 --> 00:48:26,270
Sweet..!

797
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:30,357
Sorry.

798
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:36,614
It's the Popo. Be cool.
- Be..cool?

799
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:37,948
Open up.

800
00:48:38,032 --> 00:48:39,742
Oh, crap!
We forgot about Nana.

801
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:41,744
Hold on.
Hannah, quick.

802
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:44,288
Hide your alien.
- Open the door now.

803
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:46,123
Snuggs, get in.

804
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,586
Hold on a second.
- Children of my children...

805
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:55,091
..I request entry.
I have candy sweets.

806
00:48:55,257 --> 00:48:56,133
Don't open.

807
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,052
That's not Nana.

808
00:48:58,052 --> 00:48:59,345
Are you sure?

809
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:06,477
Yeah, I'm sure.

810
00:49:08,104 --> 00:49:10,523
Surrender engineer Sparks, now.

811
00:49:10,523 --> 00:49:12,942
Get out of my way, Earth children.

812
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:14,819
Move.
- Nana...

813
00:49:14,944 --> 00:49:17,363
..don't make me hurt you.
Nana, I was...

814
00:49:24,578 --> 00:49:25,871
Return him to me.

815
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,082
Tom, do something.

816
00:49:37,258 --> 00:49:38,843
Oh, gross human.

817
00:49:42,763 --> 00:49:45,307
Someone's gotta get the door.
- If they get the cops, it's too dangerous.

818
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:48,602
Nana, move.
- Leave my Nana alone.

819
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:50,438
Silence, little human.
Silence!

820
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,567
I got Nana's controller.

821
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:57,486
Free me!
Free me or face the consequences...

822
00:49:57,486 --> 00:49:58,779
Oh, no!
- In here.

823
00:49:58,904 --> 00:50:00,614
You will not catch me.
I have you.

824
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,615
Oh, you...

825
00:50:03,576 --> 00:50:05,161
Shake all you want,
we own you.

826
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:08,831
The suitcase.

827
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,915
Go.

828
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:15,588
Ha, missed!

829
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:18,299
Stand still,
Earth maggot!

830
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:22,011
Got it.
- Don't let them take Mr. Snugglelump.

831
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:23,596
Art, quick.

832
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,015
Shoot them!
- Shoot the humans!

833
00:50:27,183 --> 00:50:28,768
Shoot them!
- Get down.

834
00:50:32,146 --> 00:50:34,148
You lose.
- He's ours forever.

835
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,944
I'm sorry, Han.
I'm sorry they got him.

836
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,865
Sweet, huh?
- Very nice.

837
00:50:42,948 --> 00:50:45,493
This is the Creek Landing
Sheriff's Department...

838
00:50:45,618 --> 00:50:48,871
..open this door at once or
I'll begin enforceable entry.

839
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:51,290
In 10, 9...
- Okay.

840
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,377
You guys get rid of the cop,
I'm going after the aliens.

841
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,713
5, 4...
- We can't leave him up here.

842
00:50:58,506 --> 00:50:59,382
..1.

843
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,426
Don't know how much, you kids,
know about penal codes.

844
00:51:02,676 --> 00:51:05,513
But making phone calls with the intent
to annoy or harass...

845
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:06,806
..is a serious offense.

846
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,017
It's congruent to mischief and
it can mean 6 months in jail.

847
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,645
911 is for emergency calls only.

848
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:17,400
In any misuse of this system compromises
this county's only line of defense.

849
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:19,026
And that's me.

850
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:21,612
Around here, I'm the law.

851
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:23,280
Literally, I'm the only one.

852
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,366
My Deputy is on maternity leave.

853
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:27,910
Look, Sheriff.
We told you, we were sorry.

854
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,078
It won't happen again.

855
00:51:29,078 --> 00:51:31,080
So, really...
You can leave now, we'll be good.

856
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:34,041
Oh, I can leave?
Okay, we got the whole problem solved.

857
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,213
Hey, what's in there?
- Don't worry about it.

858
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:40,506
Squadron, come in!
Come in!

859
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,675
Do you have Sparks?
- No.

860
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,636
Oh, is there any job,
you two don't screw up?

861
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:47,513
Come in!

862
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,683
I'm sorry, I apologize.
That was unthought for it.

863
00:51:50,766 --> 00:51:52,768
You are still trapped in that box,
aren't you?

864
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,478
Yes, I'm.

865
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:56,939
Step aside, young man.
- No, no need for that.

866
00:51:57,356 --> 00:51:58,941
It's just my sister's robot dog.

867
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:01,235
It's sound activated.

868
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,613
Right, Han?
- Right. It's not an alien.

869
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:08,284
You know what?
I'm gonna take a look inside that chest.

870
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:09,869
So please step aside.

871
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:25,384
It's the Popo.
Be cool.

872
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:28,596
One hour!
We were gone one hour.

873
00:52:28,596 --> 00:52:29,889
What happened?
What this kids do?

874
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:32,433
Hi, I'm Nina Pearson.
Are you kids, okay?

875
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,310
Is everything, okay?
- No, ma'am.

876
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,688
I would say making a forgery call to 911
about an alien invasion...

877
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:38,981
..is most definitely not okay.

878
00:52:39,148 --> 00:52:40,441
You called 911?

879
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:42,860
Come on, buddy.
I'm sure, you can let these kids off...

880
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,028
..with a warning.

881
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:45,154
Look at them.

882
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,490
One, I'm not your buddy.

883
00:52:47,573 --> 00:52:50,284
Two, I have noticed that your vehicle
is missing a proper license plate.

884
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:54,413
Three, how about I write you a big ticket?
- How about you don't?

885
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:56,082
Nate, stop talking.

886
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,751
You people usually leave your kids
unsupervised like this?

887
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:00,669
No. No!
Not at all.

888
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:02,254
We had to go into town to the leasing office.

889
00:53:02,254 --> 00:53:03,839
They...
They shut our power off.

890
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:05,591
Looks, alright to me.

891
00:53:06,842 --> 00:53:09,261
Sheriff, I know this is something
hard to explain.

892
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:11,389
But honestly, there is nothing wrong here.

893
00:53:11,514 --> 00:53:14,350
Hey, why don't you stay and see for yourself?
We're barbecuing.

894
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,185
Join us.
- Mom...

895
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,729
Thank you, ma'am, I would like to.
But I'm on duty.

896
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,731
Look, the kids made a big mistake.

897
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:22,858
And I assure you, Tom will be punished.

898
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:24,568
But my wife is right.
We got plenty of great food.

899
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:25,569
Why don't you stick around?

900
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,862
Look, I know you're on the job.

901
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:28,989
But there's no law against
home cooked meal.

902
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:30,825
We got lots of hot dogs,

903
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,952
..hamburgers, steaks...

904
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:36,288
You'll love it.

905
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:38,999
Okay.

906
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:45,131
I have to tell you this.
It has been a while.

907
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:48,175
Alrite, I'm successfully twisted.
- Great.

908
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:50,177
I guess, a hour off won't kill anyone.

909
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:51,762
Oh, no.

910
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,599
Gotcha.
- Hey!

911
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,604
What was that?

912
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,482
What was, what?
- No, I felt something.

913
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:05,443
Come on, everyone. Dinner.
- Everyone, dinner...

914
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,862
..inside.
- I got the dessert.

915
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:15,327
You're going down, punk.
- You're going down, punk.

916
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,329
I just said that.
- I just said that.

917
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:18,748
Stop that.
- Stop that.

918
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,129
You been punked!

919
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,341
Hey, yeah!
Ziraconia!

920
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:30,342
s

921
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:32,344
s

922
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:34,638
s

923
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:37,433
Okay. Hold on, Mom.
I didn't hear one word.

924
00:54:37,433 --> 00:54:38,309
Now, what happened?

925
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,770
One moment,
I'm cleaning my dentures...

926
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,606
..and the next thing, you know,
I'm down here.

927
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,525
You know, your entitled to see a
few moments at your age.

928
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,818
I'm sorry, Sweety.
I forgot.

929
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:48,903
Did you want cheese in your burger?

930
00:54:48,903 --> 00:54:50,071
No.

931
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:51,822
I wanna to find whoever invented love...

932
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:53,532
..and hack him into pulp with a machete.

933
00:54:56,118 --> 00:54:58,662
Boy trouble.
- That makes two of us.

934
00:54:58,954 --> 00:55:00,664
I don't know what to do about this,
Tom situation.

935
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,917
Be the guest.
Happy face.

936
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,962
Hey, Nate. Where's Jake?
- I've no idea.

937
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:09,840
Well, dinner is almost ready.
How about you track him down?

938
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:11,425
Jake's an adult.

939
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:13,552
If he wants to eat,
he'll come down and get it.

940
00:55:13,886 --> 00:55:16,013
Aww, sorry.
- Stop or it'll will.

941
00:55:16,138 --> 00:55:17,848
You said it.
- No, you're pushing me.

942
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,725
Oops!
Watch your head.

943
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:23,437
I tell you this,
there is nothing more American...

944
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,439
..than a solid chunk of meat
in your stomach.

945
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,401
I bought the pickles.
- Really?

946
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,653
Well, if you think these things will
get you out of that ticket...

947
00:55:30,778 --> 00:55:32,363
..it's a no-go, mister.

948
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,419
My stomach!
I'm starving.

949
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,254
Any word from Jake?
- Still no signal.

950
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,255
Where is he?

951
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,965
Hey, boys!
You guys, not at the table.

952
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,092
Right, Nate?
- What, right?

953
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:56,178
They're playing with their phones.
- Oh, yeah, whatever, open up.

954
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,432
Can someone pass me the mustard.

955
00:56:00,808 --> 00:56:01,976
Hey, Hannah!

956
00:56:02,351 --> 00:56:03,936
Did you eat all the hot dogs?

957
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,313
No!

958
00:56:06,939 --> 00:56:08,941
I mean, yes.

959
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:14,822
I tell ya, I usually eat only noodles
in my squad car.

960
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:17,241
Everyday, by myself.

961
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,288
Comfortable up there, earth boy?
- Hope so.

962
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:24,582
Enjoy some dirt in your face.

963
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,754
Attention, all.
Resistance is futile.

964
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31,756
Give me, what I need.
- Oh, baby.

965
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:33,299
I knew you would come back.

966
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:34,717
Step aside, hormonal female.

967
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:37,511
Wait!
You're calling me, hormonal?

968
00:56:37,636 --> 00:56:39,764
Back away.
You're irrelevant to my mission.

969
00:56:40,056 --> 00:56:41,348
Irrelevant?

970
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:43,476
I don't care, how old you're.

971
00:56:43,476 --> 00:56:45,186
But you can't talk to me like that.

972
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:49,440
What is going on?
- Teen drama. I..I think.

973
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,275
It is teen drama,
right, Ricky?

974
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:52,943
Snuggles.

975
00:56:53,069 --> 00:56:54,779
Turn him off.
- It's not me.

976
00:56:56,072 --> 00:56:57,656
Let's move. Bring Nana's.

977
00:56:57,865 --> 00:56:59,575
Wow, wow, wow!
Freeze.

978
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:02,703
You kids are not excused.

979
00:57:03,662 --> 00:57:04,955
Let them go.

980
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:08,834
We're playing a game, Uncle Stu...

981
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,213
I mean, Stu.
We're on vacation.

982
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:16,092
Am I aging backwards?
No, I don't think so.

983
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:19,845
You really want to deny me my time
with the kids?

984
00:57:20,388 --> 00:57:23,349
Wow, guilt never gets old.
Well, go ahead.

985
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:29,146
I think, we ought to keep Mom
out of the Pinot Grigio.

986
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:48,124
You have lost.

987
00:57:48,582 --> 00:57:50,710
And now the invasion shall begin.

988
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:51,711
Invasion?

989
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,295
I mean, there's more of you guys coming?

990
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:54,171
Many more!

991
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:56,966
And we'll crush you like bugs.

992
00:57:57,091 --> 00:57:58,676
Not if we crush you first.

993
00:57:58,801 --> 00:58:00,803
I will not be beaten by children.

994
00:58:01,095 --> 00:58:02,680
Any more signs of resistance...

995
00:58:02,805 --> 00:58:05,766
..and the one you call Jake will be eliminated.

996
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:08,227
I want Snugglelump back.

997
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:11,188
That's it!
Time to die!

998
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:16,527
Richard,
you remember Nana?

999
00:58:18,154 --> 00:58:21,407
Game on.
- Game over.

1000
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:26,912
Wow!

1001
00:58:42,094 --> 00:58:43,387
Wow, what was that move?

1002
00:58:43,512 --> 00:58:45,514
Double handed flip with a left-handed twist.

1003
00:58:47,516 --> 00:58:49,101
Nana, get up!

1004
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,358
He's on the light.
Send Nana after him.

1005
00:58:57,026 --> 00:58:57,902
Nana!

1006
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,695
Lee, flying is your specialty.

1007
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:23,511
Take him out, Lee.
- I can't.

1008
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:24,804
Art, hurry up!
Art, hurry up!

1009
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:26,389
Give it to me.

1010
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:47,243
Ricky?
- What the...

1011
00:59:50,705 --> 00:59:51,997
Nana?

1012
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:05,136
Yes, scream human,
for your species ends tonight.

1013
01:00:08,764 --> 01:00:10,641
What the heck was that thing?

1014
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:11,642
Space alien.

1015
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:13,394
Too much to explain.

1016
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:16,063
We think, they're probaly here to destory
the world as we know it.

1017
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,315
Come on, if we don't get down there,
we're gonna be in real trouble.

1018
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:21,694
I would say that's the understatement
of the century.

1019
01:00:23,446 --> 01:00:25,865
Mom?
Are you okay?

1020
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:31,412
What happened?
How do I..get...

1021
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:34,707
Oh, I just need a glass of water.

1022
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,960
Okay.
Somebody better start talking.

1023
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:41,255
It looks like, you guys had a battle realm here.
- We did.

1024
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,215
Nana versus Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

1025
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:46,177
Dad, it's not what it look like.
- All of you, upstairs.

1026
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:48,179
Now!
- Uncle Stu, it wasn't our fault.

1027
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:49,638
Now!

1028
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:58,147
Okay, unless you want to join them.
You better spill it.

1029
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:00,274
What the heck happened in here?

1030
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:02,610
I haven't got a clue is to what happened.

1031
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:05,571
But my back hasn't felt this good in ages.

1032
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:09,909
Mom? Mom?
Where you going?

1033
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:11,744
Aliens.
- Mom?

1034
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:24,423
Build a machine. Now.
- No.

1035
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,935
I'm sorry, guys.

1036
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:38,270
It's over.

1037
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:39,563
Over?

1038
01:01:40,564 --> 01:01:44,360
It's not gonna be over.
Ricky is down in the basement with that...

1039
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:47,488
..space rodent.
- You don't get it.

1040
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,615
An entire fleet of those guys are
about to invade.

1041
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,867
Well, man up and deal with it.

1042
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:54,328
I have been...all day.

1043
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:57,373
Well, if he's scared,
may be you guys can help me.

1044
01:01:57,498 --> 01:01:58,791
Not without Tom.

1045
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:02,795
Why?
- Because he's our leader.

1046
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:05,548
Come on.

1047
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:09,093
It's not just Ricky,
Jake needs your help too.

1048
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:12,596
And Snuggles.
- And like, everyone on earth.

1049
01:02:12,722 --> 01:02:14,306
Including our parents.

1050
01:02:23,232 --> 01:02:24,525
Alrite.

1051
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:27,403
Let's go, save the planet.

1052
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,489
And your dumb, old boyfriend.

1053
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:02,980
You want monkey?
He's got luck.

1054
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:05,232
I'm fine.

1055
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:11,197
Stay close.

1056
01:03:11,322 --> 01:03:13,032
They could be anywhere.

1057
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:51,195
It's Jake.

1058
01:03:52,113 --> 01:03:53,280
Those Zirconians!

1059
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,700
They tied me up and
dragged Snuggles outside.

1060
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,827
This vacation really sucks.
- You seen the machine?

1061
01:03:57,952 --> 01:04:00,079
Yeah, you were right.
It was sent here years ago.

1062
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:02,289
Some idiot built this place,
back on top of it.

1063
01:04:02,415 --> 01:04:04,542
Guys, help me here with Ricky.

1064
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:07,044
He's waking up.
- Where the heck am I?

1065
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:09,922
Oh baby, I'm so glad,
you're okay.

1066
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:12,216
Wow, don't touch me!

1067
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:16,387
Stop.
- Okay, okay.

1068
01:04:16,387 --> 01:04:19,348
I know, it's been a really weird day,
but you have to let me explain.

1069
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:21,559
Okay.

1070
01:04:22,393 --> 01:04:23,686
Okay.

1071
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,022
Explain to me why I keep blacking out.

1072
01:04:26,689 --> 01:04:27,565
Why I'm bleeding and...

1073
01:04:27,565 --> 01:04:31,652
..why your grandma did a fine ninja kick
on my face down the stairs.

1074
01:04:31,777 --> 01:04:33,070
Okay.

1075
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:37,074
We are fighting, um, space aliens.

1076
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:38,367
Yeah, yeah!

1077
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:41,829
Okay, they're small but dangerous and
really scary.

1078
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:44,373
Oh, no! Of course, I believe you.
Why wouldn't I be?

1079
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:46,292
Bethany, why you wanna waste our time...

1080
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:48,002
..playing hide and seek and kill the aliens...

1081
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:50,838
..with your stupid brother and
your dumb little cousins?

1082
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:56,260
Don't talk about my family like that.

1083
01:04:56,594 --> 01:04:58,721
Oh, you don't have to worry
about it anymore.

1084
01:04:58,846 --> 01:05:00,139
Because we're done.

1085
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:02,892
I knew, I should have stayed home and
hooked up with Annie Filkins.

1086
01:05:03,017 --> 01:05:05,144
She's smoking hot and
she doesn't like talking about...

1087
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:07,021
..feelings all the time.

1088
01:05:08,356 --> 01:05:10,483
I'm going straight to Annie's.

1089
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:21,035
I'm really sorry.

1090
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:23,287
Don't be.

1091
01:05:23,704 --> 01:05:24,997
You were right all along.

1092
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:26,832
If it's any consolation...

1093
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,168
..he's not going straight to Annie's.

1094
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:30,878
Or anywhere for a while.

1095
01:05:31,253 --> 01:05:32,421
Wow!

1096
01:05:33,089 --> 01:05:34,673
Guys, enough of this sibling bonding.

1097
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,384
We're in DEFCON 1, here.

1098
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:49,146
Oh, my God.

1099
01:05:49,271 --> 01:05:51,816
They're forcing him to build it.
- Building, what?

1100
01:05:52,191 --> 01:05:53,901
How would they beat the world
with that thing?

1101
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:55,194
I really don't want to find out.

1102
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,446
We gotta stop them before
their fleet arrives.

1103
01:05:57,571 --> 01:05:59,699
Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

1104
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:01,409
We have to rescue Snugglelump.

1105
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:03,244
Snuggle what?
- Lump.

1106
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:05,788
The foreign fella.
He's on our side.

1107
01:06:05,913 --> 01:06:08,040
The other three,
not so much.

1108
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:09,959
This is so not happening.

1109
01:06:09,959 --> 01:06:11,252
We got to get out there.
Let's move.

1110
01:06:11,252 --> 01:06:12,962
Not so fast.
I have a plan.

1111
01:06:13,504 --> 01:06:16,340
Look at me here.
Did Nana give anyone, mentos?

1112
01:06:16,465 --> 01:06:18,175
Why?
- Hand them over.

1113
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,176
Alrite.

1114
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:21,721
What? We're gonna throw candy at them?
- No.

1115
01:06:21,846 --> 01:06:23,848
My little science project.

1116
01:06:30,146 --> 01:06:32,148
Mentos bomb.
You're a genius.

1117
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:35,317
We shouldn't do this.
Humans, friendly group...

1118
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,652
Incoming!

1119
01:06:38,237 --> 01:06:39,405
In my eyes.

1120
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:41,574
Let's get them!
Move!

1121
01:06:41,824 --> 01:06:42,700
Move!

1122
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:45,703
Snuggles!

1123
01:06:45,828 --> 01:06:46,996
Traitor-r-r!

1124
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:54,462
Leave me!
- Every men those mess with chicks gets...

1125
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:57,840
He's out cold.

1126
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,926
You?
- Get off my planet...

1127
01:07:00,926 --> 01:07:02,928
..you little green son of a...

1128
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:19,195
How do you feel now?
- We did it.

1129
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:20,780
Finally, we did.

1130
01:07:22,573 --> 01:07:24,158
How do we do..?
- Too bad...

1131
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:27,536
..not sweet, so!
Not sweet!

1132
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,210
Hey, humans...
- Guys, listen!

1133
01:07:34,877 --> 01:07:39,382
..machine..molecule expand...
machine make the Commander...

1134
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:47,973
Who's little now,
Earth maggots?

1135
01:07:48,182 --> 01:07:51,018
Pretty cool, huh?
- We're gonna need a bigger potato.

1136
01:07:51,143 --> 01:07:53,979
It's over.
I win.

1137
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:56,232
Where's he going?
- Anywhere he wants.

1138
01:07:56,357 --> 01:07:58,776
What do we do?
- What about my Mom and Dad?

1139
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:12,581
Everyone, listen.
We don't have much time.

1140
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:14,709
Sparks, can anything go on
in that machine?

1141
01:08:14,834 --> 01:08:15,710
Theoretically.
- Good.

1142
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:17,294
Art, Lee!
I'm gonna need you to control it.

1143
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,547
Bethany, I need you to keep the
other aliens on locked out.

1144
01:08:19,672 --> 01:08:20,965
Okay.

1145
01:08:23,384 --> 01:08:24,677
Jake, come on.

1146
01:08:24,677 --> 01:08:26,262
This battle is not over yet.

1147
01:08:26,762 --> 01:08:28,055
Awesome!

1148
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,725
Here.

1149
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,227
Wow, cool.
Super-sized.

1150
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:37,314
You're one ugly alien.

1151
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:42,111
He may be ugly but he's mine.

1152
01:08:42,236 --> 01:08:44,238
You don't know to quit, do you?

1153
01:08:47,658 --> 01:08:49,368
We need a clean shot at his neck.

1154
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,078
I'm going up.

1155
01:08:57,293 --> 01:08:59,837
You broke my nail.
- I don't care.

1156
01:09:06,302 --> 01:09:07,595
Wow!

1157
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:15,436
Oh, my God!
It's the beacons.

1158
01:09:15,561 --> 01:09:17,271
He's calling the invasion.

1159
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,818
Holy Mother Mary!
- Look at this...

1160
01:09:22,943 --> 01:09:26,614
Oh, God! Bless America!
That's what I call a patriotic act.

1161
01:09:26,739 --> 01:09:29,575
Not bad.
- But it's nothing compared to this.

1162
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,868
Wow! Wow!

1163
01:09:30,993 --> 01:09:33,829
Those are Category 3 pyrotechnics
you got there.

1164
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:35,915
I suppose, it's another ticket.

1165
01:09:38,084 --> 01:09:40,503
Light them up.
Let's put that guy to shame.

1166
01:09:43,381 --> 01:09:46,008
I got it.
Tom! Tom, I found it.

1167
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:50,012
Get him to turn around.

1168
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:54,725
Hey, down here!
You prehistoric space scumb.

1169
01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:03,776
Nice one, Nate.
- That was awesome.

1170
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:07,446
These things cost only $1.99,
can you believe it?

1171
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:10,950
I don't think that's you, Nate.
- What is that?

1172
01:10:11,492 --> 01:10:12,785
It's them.

1173
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,162
They all be coming soon.

1174
01:10:15,371 --> 01:10:16,956
Open your eyes, people.

1175
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:19,291
There's only one answer.

1176
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:22,002
Meteor shower!
- Oh, that's right! I heard...

1177
01:10:22,128 --> 01:10:24,547
Oh, yeah..yeah.
- Oh..sure.

1178
01:10:30,302 --> 01:10:31,887
That's all you got?

1179
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:35,182
Oh, hey!
- Come on...

1180
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:39,103
Tom!
Take the shot.

1181
01:10:39,603 --> 01:10:40,479
Shoot him.

1182
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,606
His collar is still in the way.

1183
01:10:43,315 --> 01:10:44,483
Look out!

1184
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,318
The ugly one got big.

1185
01:10:47,153 --> 01:10:49,196
Hurry.
Do it, Tom.

1186
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,448
45 meters...

1187
01:10:50,448 --> 01:10:54,243
The angle is...,
resistance's all gone. Speed squared.

1188
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,953
45 degrees.

1189
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:57,872
What was that?

1190
01:11:02,043 --> 01:11:04,170
You messed with the wrong mathlete.

1191
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,472
Yes.
- Get him away from him.

1192
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:17,141
Commander?
- Wait a second.

1193
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:22,813
...humans!
Is that all you have?

1194
01:11:23,022 --> 01:11:24,315
Looks good.

1195
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,201
You see that?
- Sparks, reverse the machine.

1196
01:11:45,961 --> 01:11:47,254
Too easy.

1197
01:11:51,092 --> 01:11:53,219
Nothing's working.
- Give it to me.

1198
01:11:56,764 --> 01:11:58,474
Oh, Cruel!
- But effective.

1199
01:11:58,599 --> 01:11:59,892
It was awesome.

1200
01:12:03,604 --> 01:12:06,565
Reversed.
- Tommy, it's time.

1201
01:12:17,535 --> 01:12:19,120
You came back for me.

1202
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:22,081
Let's get...
We can hug like this in Zirkon.

1203
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:35,302
Bethany!
- Han, you okay?

1204
01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:36,595
Over here!
- Bethany!

1205
01:12:36,637 --> 01:12:37,805
Did you guys, seen it?
- Good job, Han.

1206
01:12:37,805 --> 01:12:38,681
Snuggs was great.

1207
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,225
So were you guys.
- Tom, what about the others?

1208
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:43,644
There's too many.

1209
01:12:50,735 --> 01:12:53,696
Retreat! Retreat!
The machine is destroyed.

1210
01:12:53,904 --> 01:12:56,741
We have been outsmarted by the humans.

1211
01:12:57,033 --> 01:13:01,120
The invasion has failed.
Retreat to Zirkon, right away.

1212
01:13:01,495 --> 01:13:03,497
Retreat! Retreat!

1213
01:13:11,422 --> 01:13:13,007
It's gone.

1214
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:16,177
It's over.

1215
01:13:16,302 --> 01:13:17,887
It's all over!

1216
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:20,431
We woned!

1217
01:13:22,016 --> 01:13:23,309
Thanks Snuggs...

1218
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:24,435
..for everything.

1219
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,396
You're alright for a space maggot.
I'm gonna miss you.

1220
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:30,900
Miss him? He's staying here.
With us.

1221
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:35,654
Please, don't go.
You can be a part of our family.

1222
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,669
Han, I think he already got a family.

1223
01:13:53,005 --> 01:13:54,590
My family.

1224
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:07,561
Goodbye, Hannah.

1225
01:14:52,023 --> 01:14:53,190
Hey!

1226
01:14:53,733 --> 01:14:54,900
Hey!

1227
01:14:58,112 --> 01:15:01,365
Listen, about your grades...
- Dad, let me save your lecture.

1228
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:05,161
You were right!
And I was wrong.

1229
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:08,581
Turns out, there are advantages
to being smart.

1230
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:11,917
I'm sorry.

1231
01:15:13,878 --> 01:15:15,880
I just, really great lecture planned.

1232
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,590
Even rehearsed in front of the mirror.

1233
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,058
Did you see the meteor shower?
- Yeah!

1234
01:15:27,475 --> 01:15:29,477
Yeah, it was life changing.

1235
01:15:34,982 --> 01:15:37,068
Nice catch, Nana.
- Hey!

1236
01:15:38,277 --> 01:15:39,445
I got one.

1237
01:15:39,445 --> 01:15:41,447
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
Come on.

1238
01:16:03,386 --> 01:16:04,678
Annie.
- Ricky...

1239
01:16:04,678 --> 01:16:07,223
I thought, you were at your lake house?
- Well, vacation ended early.

1240
01:16:07,348 --> 01:16:09,767
This is it for you.
- You're so sweet...

1241
01:16:09,892 --> 01:16:11,602
Well, hey, you're my girlfriend now.

1242
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:13,437
So there's nothing,
I wouldn't do for you.

1243
01:16:13,562 --> 01:16:15,981
Now, give pappa some su-u-u...

1244
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:20,069
Ladies...
- It's the girl's night out.

1245
01:16:20,194 --> 01:16:23,155
But, hey, you should come.
If you like to dancing.

1246
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,865
Dancing?

1247
01:16:25,658 --> 01:16:29,328
You ain't even seen dancing...
- Until you seen the Funky Ricky.

1248
01:16:40,297 --> 01:16:41,882
Wedgie time!

1249
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:46,095
I think, he got kinda crazy.

1250
01:16:49,098 --> 01:16:50,683
Turn him off.

1251
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,979
Ricky, you're acting really weird.

1252
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:56,939
What are you talking about?

1253
01:16:57,273 --> 01:16:58,983
Okay, back on.

1254
01:17:09,827 --> 01:17:11,537
I'm so keeping this.

1255
01:17:11,537 --> 01:17:12,538
s

1256
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:14,540
s

1257
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,542
s

1258
01:17:17,543 --> 01:17:18,544
s
