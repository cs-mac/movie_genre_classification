1
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,823
<i>Today is my birthday.</i>

2
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:56,917
<i>And for the first time in 20 years,
I am not alone.</i>

3
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,965
<i>You see, I met someone.</i>

4
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,592
<i>A man.</i>

5
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:08,597
<i>A killer.</i>

6
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:14,476
<i>And soon he will kill me.</i>

7
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:38,218
<i>It was supposed to be a holiday.</i>

8
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,429
<i>A trip to San Francisco to paint.</i>

9
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,429
<i>To rest.</i>

10
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:50,476
<i>I had to return to Vancouver
that very morning but I changed my mind.</i>

11
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,438
<i>That simple decision has sealed my fate.</i>

12
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,394
Don't, please!

13
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,521
Please. Whatever they paid you...

14
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:07,850
...I can give you more.

15
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,478
Everything I have! Please!

16
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,531
For the love of God! Have mercy!

17
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:39,788
My name... is Yo.

18
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,868
<i>Twenty years since my parents died.</i>

19
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,368
<i>Twenty years I've been alone.</i>

20
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,077
<i>I suppose I paint
what I'm afraid to wish for.</i>

21
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,797
<i>He is called the Freeman.</i>

22
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:25,302
<i>And now... he will free me.</i>

23
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,632
- Thank you.
- Go right through.

24
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,187
- Hello.
- Hello. Open your case, please.

25
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:07,562
Of course.

26
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,979
Here you go, sir.

27
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:25,410
- What is this?
- Clay.

28
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,914
Clay? You're bringing clay
into the country?

29
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:30,582
I'm a potter.

30
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:36,095
Good pots are made from good clay
and a good potter makes his own.

31
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,468
The trick is to find the right mud.

32
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:41,345
I dry it, lump it into small pieces...

33
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:43,724
...and carefully sift it.

34
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:47,146
The object, obviously,
is to increase the claytal quality...

35
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:50,769
...so you end up with good plasticity
and a high refraction.

36
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:54,196
I've heard some people store their clay
for up to 20 years.

37
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:59,452
Miss, will I be breaking that record
at this counter?

38
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,575
- Is there a problem here?
- No.

39
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,577
Not at all.

40
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,710
Thank you.

41
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:42,250
Still using a different gun for each job?

42
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:44,670
Such a waste.

43
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,218
I'm going back.

44
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:51,176
Back where?

45
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,059
Go ahead. Pull the trigger.

46
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:58,387
I'm going home.

47
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:01,022
You have no home.

48
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,525
Pull it.

49
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,664
The Dragons were very happy
with the San Francisco killing.

50
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,368
The son is dead.

51
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,337
<i>But the father is an old lion
and he still dreams of conquest.</i>

52
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:25,541
<i>Shimazaki can still bite.</i>

53
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:29,421
<i>Now he is here, in Vancouver.</i>

54
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,433
<i>Exactly where we want him to be.</i>

55
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:42,279
- Looking for me, chief?
- Yeah. Detective Netah, Detective Forge.

56
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,986
Detective Netah's with Interpol.
He's your new boss.

57
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,531
You'll find out the rest
along with everyone else.

58
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,411
See you in there.

59
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:55,121
Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Thank you.

60
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:59,291
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Shimazaki of the Hakushin Society.

61
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,175
Now, Mr. Shimazaki is here
as a Japanese citizen...

62
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:07,639
...who, as he puts it, wishes to avoid
any unnecessary bloodshed.

63
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,846
I'd also like to introduce you
to Detective Netah from Tokyo.

64
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,721
He's here as a kind of,
let's say, cultural liaison.

65
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:19,812
It's thanks to him that we can discuss
this situation with Mr. Shimazaki today.

66
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,827
I am Shimazaki...

67
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:33,206
...Lord of 26,000 subjects
and leader of the Hakushin Society.

68
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,999
On August 4th, in San Francisco...

69
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,342
...my son died.

70
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:47,806
Unworthy death
at the hand of an assassin.

71
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,986
A woman who lives in your city
witnessed the murder.

72
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,162
Her name is Emu O'Hara.

73
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:09,501
The assassin will come to kill her.
You will not interfere.

74
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,541
We give him the woman
or else he calls out his gangs.

75
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:14,541
It's gonna be a goddam bloodbath.

76
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:18,218
He wants us to leave the broad
wide open. It's a fucking setup!

77
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,716
That's out of line!

78
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:25,387
Come on, we're cops.
Do you wanna get involved?

79
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,102
- We're here to serve and attack.
- Now.

80
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,816
What kind of bullshit is this?

81
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:33,650
Look, we're obviously in a very
tricky political situation here.

82
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,613
We gotta keep our cool.

83
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,365
The man who murdered my son
is here in your city.

84
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,696
He is here to kill the witness...

85
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,740
...simply because she saw his face.

86
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,710
This is his code.

87
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:51,503
Code? What kind of killer is he?

88
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:55,258
He belongs to
an ancient Chinese warrior cult...

89
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:58,218
...called The Sons of the Dragons.

90
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,385
He is their executioner.

91
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:04,178
<i>A single man, very powerful.</i>

92
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:06,812
<i>They need no other.</i>

93
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:11,149
Christ! Sounds like a fucking video game!

94
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,360
Next thing, we'll be playing
Dungeons and Dragons.

95
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,737
Uh-uh.
Attack of the Yakuza Killers from Mars.

96
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,200
- It's a bestseller. My kid's got it.
- OK, come on, come on!

97
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,451
Mr. Shimazaki doesn't joke, gentlemen.

98
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:27,923
The roots of The Sons of the Dragons
are very old and run very deep.

99
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:33,466
Fourteen centuries ago, the Manchus
overthrew the Chinese emperor...

100
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:36,344
...and instituted the reign of terror.

101
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,970
108 militant Buddhist monks
mounted a revolt.

102
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:43,813
The Manchus destroyed
all but five of the monks.

103
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:48,279
These five founded
the society of The Sons of the Dragons.

104
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,772
They became the guardian
of the Chinese people...

105
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:54,237
...struggling against
injustice and oppression.

106
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,781
<i>They have one killer... the Freeman.</i>

107
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:02,204
<i>Legend has it that the Dragon
breathes within this man...</i>

108
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,337
<i>... that he cannot die.</i>

109
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,464
<i>His bodies change.</i>

110
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:10,965
<i>He could be Chinese, American,
Japanese. Any color, any race.</i>

111
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:17,188
<i>But he is always the Dragon,
always the same man. A superkiller.</i>

112
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:19,899
<i>Part fact...</i>

113
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,895
...part wishful thinking?

114
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,399
Who knows?

115
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,648
The Sons of the Dragons exist!

116
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,782
So does the Freeman.

117
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,243
They are fanatics, criminals!

118
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,465
You have 48 hours to find him.

119
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:42,300
After that, well...

120
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,011
You have been warned.

121
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,409
Stay here.

122
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,886
Shit! Move out of the way!

123
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:01,125
Watch out!

124
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,095
Yo.

125
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,997
The Yakuza will think twice
before they return to China.

126
00:20:34,089 --> 00:20:36,841
The murderers are dead. Both of them.

127
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,083
We have our revenge.

128
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:41,884
It is as it should be.

129
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:06,907
Do it quickly. Without thought.

130
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:54,242
Look, I really don't know anything.
I can't help you.

131
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,455
- It all happened...
- So fast. Yes, I know.

132
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,877
She doesn't seem
to know much of anything.

133
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,962
How about we got over her deposition
to the San Francisco police once more?

134
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,718
But nothing in this deposition
indicates that she ever mentioned Yo!

135
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,555
But that's what she said
when she saw him today.

136
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:19,398
Do you think she withheld critical
information from the police, Forge?

137
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,856
If she has, it's a serious charge, Detective.

138
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:24,940
Yo.

139
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:28,406
Is this a Japanese name?

140
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,239
Is he Japanese?

141
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,077
Fine. You're free to go.

142
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:40,046
But you see...

143
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:44,585
...you should understand, Miss O'Hara...

144
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:51,094
...that this Mr. Yo is going to be a lot
less gentle with you than I have been.

145
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,524
You'd better talk to me, Miss O'Hara.

146
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:58,357
Or you'll end up dead.

147
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:05,319
Miss O'Hara, wait. One moment, please.

148
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,901
Shimazaki gave us an ultimatum.

149
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:11,082
The Yakuza want revenge.
They want this killer.

150
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:15,746
And unless we deliver him in 40 hours,
there's gonna be a gang war.

151
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,376
The city's gonna become a battlefield.

152
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:22,299
Lot of people are gonna die.

153
00:24:25,474 --> 00:24:27,515
I'm sorry, Detective...

154
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,678
...I wanna go home.

155
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,140
Yeah.

156
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,227
Did you know, Miss O'Hara...

157
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:40,065
...that in China,
when a murderer introduces himself...

158
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:42,317
...it means he will kill you?

159
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:52,124
Miss O'Hara, wait. We'll drive you home.

160
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,851
Miss O'Hara.

161
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,603
You better have an official warrant
if you intend to come into my house.

162
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:14,738
Some people don't need a warrant,
do they, Miss O'Hara?

163
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,862
They get an invitation.

164
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:23,995
Miss O'Hara,
we don't wanna disturb you...

165
00:25:24,082 --> 00:25:27,000
...but if you would like, we can check out
the house to make sure it's safe.

166
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:30,669
- No.
- Then please wait. Please take this.

167
00:25:31,966 --> 00:25:36,345
It's an alarm. If anything should go wrong,
you just press the button...

168
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,755
...and we'll be in the house in 20 seconds.

169
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:41,138
Take it. Just in case.

170
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:49,065
<i>Detective Forge assured me that
the police would be outside all night.</i>

171
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:51,859
<i>I didn't want them in the house.</i>

172
00:25:51,948 --> 00:25:54,273
<i>My parents had died there.</i>

173
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:58,160
<i>The police had been outside
that night, too.</i>

174
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,865
- But I'm sure he...
- I'm sorry, Detective Forge...

175
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,021
...you can't help me.

176
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:06,084
And I can't help you.

177
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,999
Good night.

178
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:16,925
<i>Forge knew all about my father, the judge.</i>

179
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:19,306
<i>About his crusade against the Mafia.</i>

180
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:25,604
<i>But did she know
the guilt I carry for his death?</i>

181
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,535
Mr. Yo.

182
00:28:06,474 --> 00:28:08,514
Out kind of late...

183
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:10,226
...aren't you?

184
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:12,352
I work nights.

185
00:28:12,439 --> 00:28:16,140
There are two kinds of people
who work nights.

186
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,906
Really? I never would have taken you
for that kind.

187
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,861
It's time for you to go home.

188
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,036
It's a very dangerous part of town tonight.

189
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,663
I wouldn't like you to get hurt.

190
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:33,957
Thanks for the advice.

191
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,087
I could use some.

192
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,048
Forge, come in, Forge.

193
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,883
Forge. Come in.

194
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,550
Forge?

195
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,942
I always thought that...

196
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:58,233
...death would be cold.

197
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,284
And awful.

198
00:29:06,918 --> 00:29:08,791
Not like you.

199
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:23,892
Please, I...

200
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:36,403
I wanted you to come back.

201
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:05,043
Wake up.

202
00:31:05,134 --> 00:31:07,174
Wake up, wake up, sleepy.

203
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:14,597
- Quite a long time.
- Ryuji.

204
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,013
You lucky it's me, Netah.

205
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,982
Anyone else...

206
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:25,608
You didn't kill my man, did you, Ryuji?
I wouldn't like to have to arrest you.

207
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,491
We don't kill cops.

208
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:31,868
Unless they belong to us.

209
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:36,001
- Like you, my friend.
- Cut to the chase, please.

210
00:31:36,086 --> 00:31:39,252
I don't like chasing. Or waiting.

211
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:41,629
We want the woman.

212
00:31:57,026 --> 00:32:01,356
No way in hell. We had a deal.
You're out of it for 48 hours.

213
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,652
You back off, Ryuji. Now.
You don't make Shimazaki a liar.

214
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:07,495
You think I give a shit about your deal?

215
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,708
Why would you? Clan door's wide open
for a power play, huh, Ryuji?

216
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:17,214
That's right, Netah. I will be the boss
in exchange for the Freeman's head.

217
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:22,880
And Shimazaki's son in San Francisco,
did you hand him that, too, Blade?

218
00:32:22,972 --> 00:32:29,058
- How did the Dragons find him?
- Netah, we put you where you are.

219
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:31,853
Don't forget it!

220
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:39,063
Hey, all you have to do
is look the other way.

221
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:43,285
<i>We give her some truth serum.
She sings an opera.</i>

222
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:48,079
You forget one thing, Blade,
you're not in Japan here!

223
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,501
Dirty bastard.

224
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,085
She's beautiful...

225
00:34:44,214 --> 00:34:46,966
Our bonus...

226
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:24,339
You are the Freeman.

227
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:32,247
The weapon you're holding
was meant for her.

228
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:45,976
<i>Kill. You will kill on command.</i>

229
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:50,770
<i>Kill. You will kill on command.</i>

230
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:31,149
No.

231
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,910
Have you forgotten the laws
of the organization?

232
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,959
She's not a criminal!
She has not offended us.

233
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:44,466
She knows who you are
and you are forgetting who you are!

234
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:46,961
Kill her. Throw her out.

235
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:50,549
I won't report this to the family.

236
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,689
The hospital, Koh. Now!

237
00:39:55,024 --> 00:39:59,318
If you look for me,
if you ever want to find me...

238
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,569
...remember the name Hinomura.

239
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:06,364
- To hell with this, Freeman!
- Please, Koh!

240
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:08,114
Don't.

241
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,376
Hinomura.

242
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:24,801
I'm so cold.

243
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:34,566
<i>Three days later, I awoke in the hospital.</i>

244
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:38,147
<i>My father died here.</i>

245
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,154
<i>Before I had a chance
to ask his forgiveness.</i>

246
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:46,956
<i>I had left the house that night,
sneaking out on a dare.</i>

247
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:51,122
<i>I turned off the alarm
and left the door open.</i>

248
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:54,791
<i>That was how my father's killer got in.</i>

249
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:58,924
<i>It was Mery
who brought me here to see him.</i>

250
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:01,302
<i>And now Mery has come to see me.</i>

251
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:03,679
<i>The circle has closed.</i>

252
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:07,433
- Mery.
- Goodness, Emu, you... He...

253
00:41:07,522 --> 00:41:10,358
Sshh. Speak softly.

254
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,149
I don't want them to hear.

255
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:18,524
Mery... I need your help.

256
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:21,074
Sshh.

257
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,158
Yeah, chief, I'll call you later.

258
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:29,419
I thought Miss O'Hara
wasn't up to having visitors.

259
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:32,258
Visitors, yes. Interrogations, no.

260
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:36,043
Ease up on her, Netah.
She almost bled to death.

261
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:48,350
Miss, these need water. Could you tell me
where the washroom is, please?

262
00:41:48,444 --> 00:41:50,851
- It's around the corner.
- Thank you.

263
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,239
She wanted him to kill her.

264
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,116
You didn't catch that, did you?

265
00:41:58,204 --> 00:42:01,490
Kill her. Mm. Sure.

266
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:17,012
Inspector Netah.

267
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,265
Thanks.

268
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,481
Hello. Netah here.

269
00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:29,354
Hello. Hello?

270
00:42:29,865 --> 00:42:31,490
Who is it?

271
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:51,043
- Anything to report?
- No.

272
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,261
Jesus!

273
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:29,798
- Where d'you think she's going?
- How the fuck do I know?

274
00:43:31,518 --> 00:43:34,934
<i>Alert, the police is coming...</i>

275
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:42,357
How long have you been connected
to the Shimazaki clan?

276
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,781
You're way out of your league, Forge.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

277
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:48,952
No, you enjoy the ride,
cos it's gonna be your last one.

278
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:20,898
Forge?

279
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:24,025
Forge!

280
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,112
Forge.

281
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,032
Take my hand.

282
00:44:31,378 --> 00:44:32,836
For...

283
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:54,441
Forge.

284
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:58,166
I brought the girl to the airport, as planned.

285
00:45:09,796 --> 00:45:12,085
<i>I thought I'd been kidnapped.</i>

286
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:14,213
<i>In a sense, I had been.</i>

287
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,302
<i>Yo had sent this man to find me.</i>

288
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:36,990
<i>Remember it. Hinomura.</i>

289
00:45:40,914 --> 00:45:43,287
<i>I was leaving everything behind.</i>

290
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,202
<i>For what?</i>

291
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:47,333
<i>I didn't know.</i>

292
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,558
Please!

293
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,283
Spare me!

294
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:44,593
Look at me!

295
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,231
I have a message for your protectors.

296
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,939
The Dragon!

297
00:47:58,027 --> 00:48:02,606
Listen... I am... Hanada Ryuji...

298
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:05,991
...boss of the Hanada clan.

299
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:09,657
I declare war on the Dragons.

300
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,290
I want the Freeman.

301
00:48:13,878 --> 00:48:17,580
Or... I will return to China.

302
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:03,633
<i>I had traveled three days among people
whose language I could not understand.</i>

303
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:06,396
<i>I had spoken to no-one.</i>

304
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:12,104
<i>Yet for all this time, I felt eyes on me.</i>

305
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:15,021
<i>Someone watching.</i>

306
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:19,075
<i>Some kind of danger lurking close by.</i>

307
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,919
The girl took his heart.

308
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:53,298
He used us to let her escape.

309
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:58,345
She's more important to him than our laws.

310
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,348
He was disobedient

311
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,309
for her.

312
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:07,729
And the yakuza boss?

313
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:10,023
Ryuji Hanada?

314
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:13,068
He killed 16 of our men.

315
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:15,320
In a soy factory in Shanghai.

316
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:16,988
He challenges us.

317
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:21,910
He wants the Freeman.

318
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:28,500
It's good you reported this to us.

319
00:51:32,629 --> 00:51:36,591
Our Freeman loves someone else.

320
00:51:37,175 --> 00:51:40,804
We are jealous.

321
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:45,058
We want revenge.

322
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:50,105
Order the Freeman to kill

323
00:51:50,313 --> 00:51:51,982
Ryuji Hanada.

324
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:56,111
And you will kill after that

325
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,155
the Freeman !

326
00:52:01,594 --> 00:52:04,465
My father was a famous Japanese potter.

327
00:52:05,264 --> 00:52:07,304
He taught you, didn't he?

328
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,179
Yes.

329
00:52:17,278 --> 00:52:19,401
Then he taught me to see.

330
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:29,200
Look.

331
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,707
On this spot here.

332
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:37,004
That gives it its shape.

333
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,760
And there...

334
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:43,887
...the shadow places.

335
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:47,812
The darkness...

336
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,648
Is as necessary as the light.

337
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:55,404
Yes.

338
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,156
I am no more an artist.

339
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,997
My name, my profession...

340
00:53:12,382 --> 00:53:14,505
...everything is just a cover.

341
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,220
Who would ever guess...

342
00:53:20,308 --> 00:53:24,471
...that the executioner
for the Sons of the Dragon...

343
00:53:25,605 --> 00:53:28,061
...was just a simple potter?

344
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:32,606
<i>Seven years ago was my first exhibition.</i>

345
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,615
<i>The reviews of my work
were almost entirely raves.</i>

346
00:53:36,701 --> 00:53:39,572
<i>This work was my 15 minutes of fame...</i>

347
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:42,997
<i>... and I was going to enjoy
every second of it.</i>

348
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,865
<i>Things can change
so quickly in one's life.</i>

349
00:54:22,878 --> 00:54:26,793
<i>So quickly
that the past slips away like a dream.</i>

350
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:34,589
<i>I went back.</i>

351
00:54:34,683 --> 00:54:37,554
<i>Part of me wanted to look the other way.</i>

352
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,809
<i>But another part wanted to look further.</i>

353
00:54:46,196 --> 00:54:49,815
<i>There was no connection between me and
this man, but he looked straight at me.</i>

354
00:54:56,833 --> 00:55:00,499
<i>A dead man's eyes are a curse
to those who behold them.</i>

355
00:55:03,674 --> 00:55:06,545
<i>I wanted to see into that darkness.</i>

356
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,505
<i>I wanted to know it.</i>

357
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,459
<i>What had I stumbled into?</i>

358
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:47,093
<i>The picture showed
the two killers I'd seen in the gallery.</i>

359
00:55:47,182 --> 00:55:49,139
<i>They were torturing someone...</i>

360
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,760
<i>... a man whose body
was covered with a magnificent tattoo.</i>

361
00:55:53,146 --> 00:55:56,599
<i>I couldn't have known then
what that tattoo would mean to me.</i>

362
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,446
<i>I decided to go home immediately.</i>

363
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:11,453
<i>I would mail the film to the police
from the airport.</i>

364
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:32,923
Kill. Kill!

365
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:38,340
You will kill on command.

366
00:57:56,869 --> 00:57:58,744
<i>I was back in my hotel room.</i>

367
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:02,163
<i>My neck hurt like hell.</i>

368
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,536
<i>But what had happened?</i>

369
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:08,087
<i>Why had I been kidnapped?</i>

370
00:58:08,174 --> 00:58:10,250
<i>Had I been kidnapped?</i>

371
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:16,595
<i>All I knew was that I wanted
to get back home as fast as possible.</i>

372
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:39,286
<i>- Hello?
- Kill. You will kill on command.</i>

373
00:58:40,043 --> 00:58:42,914
<i>Open your suitcase.</i>

374
00:58:43,797 --> 00:58:45,625
<i>Now!</i>

375
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:51,420
<i>His name is Antonio Rossi.</i>

376
00:58:52,056 --> 00:58:57,182
<i>Antonio Rossi
can smell the gun on a man.</i>

377
00:58:57,271 --> 00:59:00,272
<i>So you must kill him with the knife.</i>

378
00:59:00,357 --> 00:59:03,359
<i>You must kill him with the knife.</i>

379
00:59:30,475 --> 00:59:32,931
<i>Hold on, cowboy.
Where do you think you're going?</i>

380
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,143
These flowers are for the lady.

381
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:38,223
You do what you have to do...

382
00:59:38,317 --> 00:59:42,695
...but don't come back to me unless you
have that cocksucker's finger in a bag.

383
00:59:42,989 --> 00:59:44,270
Mr. Rossi.

384
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,494
Flowers. For Kari.

385
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:54,332
Carlo, let me get back to you.

386
00:59:57,923 --> 01:00:01,173
Who the fuck
you got sending you flowers?

387
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,586
Be nice if you sent me flowers sometime.

388
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,135
The rock on your finger ain't nice enough?

389
01:00:06,224 --> 01:00:11,302
You two-time me, bitch, I'll have those
fake titties shipped back to the surgeon.

390
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,687
Who sent these flowers?

391
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,649
The Dragons.

392
01:01:16,512 --> 01:01:19,181
<i>Kill. You will kill on command</i>

393
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:35,479
We did not expect you to survive.

394
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:39,777
And it seems you walk with the Dragon!

395
01:01:39,871 --> 01:01:41,911
You have the gift...

396
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:46,080
...the dark gift of the death walker.

397
01:01:54,221 --> 01:01:57,222
The killer who cries.

398
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:02,770
Your tears... are your honor, Dragon.

399
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:06,351
You have become your faith.

400
01:02:16,913 --> 01:02:18,111
No!

401
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:05,665
<i>The witch had visited me in the night.</i>

402
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,002
<i>She'd put a mark on my body.</i>

403
01:03:08,513 --> 01:03:11,265
<i>There was nothing I could do to erase it.</i>

404
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,389
<i>The Dragon tattoo.</i>

405
01:03:13,477 --> 01:03:15,683
<i>I would be so marked forever.</i>

406
01:03:20,693 --> 01:03:23,860
The Dragon's taken you.

407
01:03:24,197 --> 01:03:27,115
Your mind. Your body.

408
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,789
His image marks you, Freeman.

409
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:39,085
It is the image of your soul.

410
01:03:39,673 --> 01:03:41,713
The longing for freedom.

411
01:03:42,426 --> 01:03:44,752
There is no freedom on earth.

412
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:48,135
True freedom is in the spirit...

413
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:51,475
...in the skies, where the Dragon soars.

414
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:55,892
Let the dream of soaring to the skies
sustain you.

415
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:03,320
I am Koh.

416
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:05,825
Your guide.

417
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:09,330
You serve the Sons of the Dragons...

418
01:04:09,415 --> 01:04:11,907
...the guardians of the Chinese people.

419
01:04:12,002 --> 01:04:16,296
Those who trespass against our race...
must die.

420
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:18,838
You will obey us...

421
01:04:18,925 --> 01:04:22,130
...our laws, our rules, our demands.

422
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:24,469
For we own you now.

423
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:27,015
You were born a killer.

424
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:29,928
It is a power that belongs to you.

425
01:04:30,397 --> 01:04:33,184
I will shape it, I will make you stronger...

426
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:36,526
...I will make you faster,
I will make you deadly.

427
01:04:36,613 --> 01:04:42,284
Our enemies will feel the Dragon's claws
pierce... their dead hearts.

428
01:04:43,662 --> 01:04:45,738
Come now.

429
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:47,871
You are reborn.

430
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,708
You are...

431
01:04:51,046 --> 01:04:53,122
...the Freeman!

432
01:05:03,309 --> 01:05:05,349
And your tears?

433
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:10,309
I don't know.

434
01:05:11,151 --> 01:05:14,237
They say all Freemen
carry a special curse.

435
01:05:15,448 --> 01:05:17,405
Perhaps they are mine.

436
01:05:18,076 --> 01:05:20,152
But don't you understand?

437
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:23,870
Koh told you to kill me.

438
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,410
You didn't.

439
01:05:27,962 --> 01:05:29,872
You fought them.

440
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:31,838
And you won.

441
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,786
It's so peaceful here.

442
01:06:15,307 --> 01:06:16,968
Yes, Koh?

443
01:06:18,227 --> 01:06:20,136
We have been attacked.

444
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:26,316
The Dragon is angry.

445
01:06:31,993 --> 01:06:33,653
In here.

446
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:38,741
Ryuji Hanada has sent us a challenge.

447
01:06:38,834 --> 01:06:40,459
Look.

448
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:58,680
- They're setting you up.
- They want you dead.

449
01:06:58,773 --> 01:07:02,474
Whoever kills the Freeman
becomes the Yakuza leader.

450
01:07:02,569 --> 01:07:04,811
Get ready. We must leave.

451
01:07:07,282 --> 01:07:10,866
- Now.
- No! You don't have to go.

452
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:15,992
He is the Freeman.
He serves the Sons of the Dragons.

453
01:07:16,084 --> 01:07:20,414
- He is obliged to come with me.
- Emu...

454
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:22,629
16 people died, Emu.

455
01:07:22,716 --> 01:07:25,042
They had families, children.

456
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:29,254
Ryuji killed them and will continue to kill
unless I go to him.

457
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,342
Ryuji can identify the Freeman.

458
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:36,263
Anyone who can identify the Freeman
must be eliminated.

459
01:07:37,275 --> 01:07:40,145
That is the law
of the Sons of the Dragons.

460
01:07:41,196 --> 01:07:43,070
We must go to Tokyo.

461
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:45,612
Ryuji will be at Shimazaki's funeral.

462
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:14,593
- Dogaki wants to speak to you, boss.
- Where the hell is he?

463
01:09:29,192 --> 01:09:31,696
It's Ryuji. What's up?

464
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:36,492
I'm having some problems, so I
won't be able to attend the funeral.

465
01:09:37,326 --> 01:09:42,749
<i>I'm sending two of my men instead.</i>

466
01:09:43,584 --> 01:09:49,632
Then, you can let them work for you.
They're good men.

467
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:52,552
Thanks, but I don't need them.

468
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,098
Ryuji, be reasonable,
it's a good offer.

469
01:09:56,932 --> 01:10:03,607
- You're the new boss.
- But I'm not the leader of the Hakushin yet.

470
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:08,613
I will accept your offer.

471
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:14,117
Thank you.

472
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:20,955
Leave her.

473
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:28,259
She knows the laws of the underworld.

474
01:10:38,604 --> 01:10:40,930
You are getting soft, Freeman.

475
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:10,259
I'm a friend of Shimazaki's.

476
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:28,160
It's good to be the new leader.
Dogaki's sending a present.

477
01:11:28,578 --> 01:11:30,872
Two men.

478
01:11:38,046 --> 01:11:40,454
Hey, you should knock on the door.

479
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:43,504
If I could, Ryuji,
I would knock your head off.

480
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:46,589
You've gone too far.

481
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:52,138
Someone has to pay for the massacre
of those 16 Chinese in the soya factory.

482
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:56,975
So, you will find someone.
That's your job.

483
01:11:57,067 --> 01:12:00,188
But... you are my number one suspect.

484
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,825
And in order to do my job,
I've gotta be gum on your shoe.

485
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:08,529
So... Chairman Blade...

486
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:13,076
...what are we having for dinner tonight?

487
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,549
A little insincere, that. Hm?

488
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:23,055
After all, it was you who sent
Shimazaki's son to San Francisco.

489
01:12:23,848 --> 01:12:29,436
And there are... a lot of people who
would be very interested in knowing that.

490
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:33,815
Come here.

491
01:12:33,901 --> 01:12:35,478
My lady.

492
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:43,653
Will you introduce me to your friend?

493
01:12:43,745 --> 01:12:48,408
Netah... let me introduce you to my wife.

494
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,959
This is... Netah.

495
01:12:52,756 --> 01:12:54,713
The cop.

496
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,299
Have we met, madam?

497
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:02,011
Why are you here, Mr. Netah?

498
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,139
Is there any problem?

499
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:08,347
Police business
and... some personal business.

500
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,485
Netah thinks he's going to steal
the Freeman from me.

501
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:16,233
But why you wait for him to come to us?

502
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:21,322
An animal on the hunt
is that much more deadly.

503
01:13:22,414 --> 01:13:27,207
- At home, he just dozes in his lair.
- Meaning?

504
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:31,673
We obtained a list of passengers
departing Vancouver...

505
01:13:31,758 --> 01:13:34,594
...the day Emu O'Hara left the hospital.

506
01:13:34,678 --> 01:13:37,430
No, she wasn't on any of those flights.

507
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:39,674
Miss O'Hara was not...

508
01:13:41,019 --> 01:13:45,016
...but a young woman
was on the flight for Tokyo.

509
01:13:46,024 --> 01:13:48,101
Alone, no luggage.

510
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:50,186
Fake passport.

511
01:13:51,989 --> 01:13:54,029
Miss O'Hara...

512
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:56,699
...is in Japan, Netah.

513
01:13:56,786 --> 01:14:00,736
We have her photograph
all over the country.

514
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,122
Everyone is looking for her.

515
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:06,792
She is with the Freeman.

516
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,920
She is his mate.

517
01:14:12,262 --> 01:14:14,634
You remember what I said, Ryuji.

518
01:14:18,228 --> 01:14:20,054
Madam, I...

519
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:22,388
I wish I... I'll see you again.

520
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:26,689
Of course we shall, Mr. Netah.

521
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:30,569
Japan is a small country.

522
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,948
And our family is... very large.

523
01:16:07,434 --> 01:16:09,676
Netah-san.

524
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:25,529
It seems you are the kind of man
who follows a woman.

525
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,036
Only when she wishes to be followed.

526
01:16:29,124 --> 01:16:32,210
And you did want me
to follow you, didn't you?

527
01:16:32,295 --> 01:16:36,293
I don't want the society members
to see me talking to you.

528
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:41,088
Come here. I have some
important information to give you.

529
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,588
And I don't want to talk too loud.

530
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:02,488
You bitch!

531
01:17:03,539 --> 01:17:08,878
To rape the wife of a Yakuza Boss
is a very serious crime.

532
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:11,168
They would kill you for it.

533
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:18,930
You see, Mr. Netah, your fumbling attempt
at blackmail has come to nothing.

534
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:24,854
If I'm to be lost, I shall take my prize.

535
01:17:49,758 --> 01:17:53,929
I am Nomura,
from the Dogaki clan.

536
01:17:54,554 --> 01:17:56,953
Have a seat.

537
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:09,988
Our condolences to
the death of Shimazaki.

538
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:14,369
Dogaki has asked us to
stay and work for you.

539
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:34,496
- I don't recognize you.
- I just got out of prison.

540
01:18:34,913 --> 01:18:39,084
- How long where you in there?
- Six years.

541
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:45,445
- Who did you kill?
- Mitsuru Sasakibara.

542
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:50,868
You killed Mitsuru?

543
01:19:12,977 --> 01:19:15,062
Let's drink sak・

544
01:19:30,121 --> 01:19:32,244
You know, Mr. Netah...

545
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:36,330
...you could be a great asset to us,
if you wanted to be.

546
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:39,540
How could you? How could you?

547
01:19:39,632 --> 01:19:43,677
- How could you?
- You take what you want, Mr. Netah.

548
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:51,976
And... I take what I want... all the time.

549
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:55,645
But it's not Ryuji at all, it's you.

550
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:59,233
It's you. You planned it all.

551
01:19:59,321 --> 01:20:04,446
You wanna be the Chairman,
a woman chairman.

552
01:20:04,534 --> 01:20:08,996
Did you know, Mr. Netah...

553
01:20:09,082 --> 01:20:11,751
...an American lives on Hokkaido?

554
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:14,667
Perhaps...

555
01:20:15,297 --> 01:20:18,631
Perhaps we shall pay her a visit.

556
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,900
Oh...I like the way
you drink sake.

557
01:20:57,425 --> 01:20:59,425
And you...

558
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
You two...

559
01:21:27,525 --> 01:21:30,225
will fit the bill perfectly.

560
01:22:18,352 --> 01:22:20,476
You are the Freeman!

561
01:23:09,994 --> 01:23:12,070
The man is a devil.

562
01:23:12,163 --> 01:23:17,039
- Let's move.
- Go ahead. I'll take care of Ryuji.

563
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:43,229
Tell Satan I said hello.

564
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,753
Now you die, Freeman.

565
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:37,459
It was my job...
to serve and watch over you.

566
01:24:39,929 --> 01:24:42,551
It was my job... to kill you.

567
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:47,561
You broke the law, my friend.

568
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:50,770
You should have killed her.

569
01:24:51,942 --> 01:24:54,268
She turned you from us.

570
01:25:44,752 --> 01:25:47,421
<i>Yo returned in the middle of the night.</i>

571
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:50,922
<i>He kept himself hidden,
but I knew he was there.</i>

572
01:25:51,009 --> 01:25:53,049
<i>I could feel his eyes.</i>

573
01:25:55,097 --> 01:25:57,671
<i>Our enemies were coming for us.</i>

574
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,558
<i>He said I had nothing to fear...</i>

575
01:26:02,689 --> 01:26:04,729
<i>... I was not alone.</i>

576
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,832
May I help you?

577
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:24,168
- You are Emu O'Hara?
- I am.

578
01:26:24,255 --> 01:26:28,123
You know what's good for you,
you cooperate with us.

579
01:26:28,218 --> 01:26:30,294
We just might let you live.

580
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:35,190
She is alone?

581
01:26:35,215 --> 01:26:38,115
So we have to wait now.

582
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
I thought that you
wanted to quit.

583
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,200
We had a bet and now
you owe me money.

584
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,600
You see? They are bad
for your health.

585
01:30:28,155 --> 01:30:30,195
<i>I've got you, Freeman!</i>

586
01:31:23,259 --> 01:31:25,382
Kill him!

587
01:33:37,285 --> 01:33:41,117
If you remove the knife,
you will bleed to death.

588
01:33:44,127 --> 01:33:45,870
You will report...

589
01:33:46,921 --> 01:33:48,581
...that it was Yo the potter...

590
01:33:49,382 --> 01:33:51,708
...who killed Shuru Shimazaki...

591
01:33:52,386 --> 01:33:55,671
...President of the Hakushin Society.

592
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,389
The motive...

593
01:33:59,477 --> 01:34:00,888
...was some past dispute.

594
01:34:02,772 --> 01:34:05,442
Today, he fought against the men...

595
01:34:05,525 --> 01:34:07,566
...of the Hakushin Society.

596
01:34:09,071 --> 01:34:11,147
And after fighting bravely...

597
01:34:13,242 --> 01:34:15,152
...he died.

598
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:19,738
You want me to...

599
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,785
...help you in your deception?

600
01:34:22,879 --> 01:34:25,915
We will vanish and you will forget us.

601
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:29,298
The Freeman... is dead.

602
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:32,966
Emu O'Hara... is dead.

603
01:34:35,809 --> 01:34:37,637
You...

604
01:34:38,688 --> 01:34:42,140
...are my... enemy!

605
01:34:57,709 --> 01:35:01,245
Live honorably... or die miserably.

606
01:35:02,673 --> 01:35:04,631
Decide now.

607
01:35:08,555 --> 01:35:10,595
On my...

608
01:35:12,059 --> 01:35:13,933
...honor!

609
01:35:52,771 --> 01:35:55,228
- No!
- I didn't give my word.

610
01:36:07,246 --> 01:36:09,286
But I did.

611
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,870
<i>Our enemies are many.</i>

612
01:36:48,042 --> 01:36:51,127
<i>Even if we destroy
all trace of ourselves...</i>

613
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:55,039
<i>... even then,
they will keep searching for us.</i>

614
01:36:56,928 --> 01:36:59,216
<i>The code of honor demands it.</i>

615
01:37:00,515 --> 01:37:03,184
<i>The fires will not burn that away.</i>

616
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:09,061
<i>I have never been afraid of death.</i>

617
01:37:11,819 --> 01:37:14,311
<i>And whether we live, or die...</i>

618
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,072
<i>... we will be free.</i>
