1
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:04,440
MISUNDERSTOOD

2
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,609
Where are the children, Duncombe?

3
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,914
They're not here.

4
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,574
I sent them away.

5
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:12,053
To the Gill's house...

6
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,123
as soon as I understood there was no hope.

7
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,758
They don't know anything yet.

8
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,001
To Andrea...?

9
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,007
I'll tell him...

10
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:25,251
he's already big.

11
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,595
I don't yet know how

12
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,642
but I'll find the courage.

13
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,829
Milo?

14
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,259
We'll try to distract him.

15
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,266
He believes...

16
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,549
that she left.

17
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:46,811
The nanny should already have arrived.

18
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,227
She will be very helpful,

19
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,942
She's a serious woman, an expert.

20
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:52,476
Milo...

21
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,977
he's so delicate...

22
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,208
so fragile...

23
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,003
just like...

24
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:02,305
like his mother.

25
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,269
Keep him close.

26
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,151
He needs her and you need him.

27
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,409
Well...

28
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,066
Thank for me the whole of
the English community please

29
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,554
Of course
-Thanks-

30
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:20,253
Accompany the Pastor to his home.

31
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,763
Go Andrea, closer!

32
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,325
Children!

33
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:22,573
Look who's here!

34
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:32,921
When did you arrive?

35
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,046
When did you arrive?

36
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,247
You came back to us?

37
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:36,749
To work?

38
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:37,989
How could I?

39
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,032
Don't you know I now have
a husband and laundry?

40
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,673
Who takes care of them?

41
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,924
No, I just came to give you a little visit

42
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,568
Blow, come on, blow.

43
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,431
I've got a cold!

44
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,632
That's not new!

45
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,528
Come on let's go,
I'll take you back home.

46
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,473
Has mum returned?

47
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,430
No, not yet.

48
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:00,120
Come on, say bye to Ms. Gill
and thank her again.

49
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,965
Good-bye Ms.Gill and
thank you very much

50
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:12,397
Good-bye Ms.Gill and
thank you very much!

51
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,481
Come on, who gets there first!

52
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:28,950
I'll give you five metres of advantage.

53
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,411
No, ten!

54
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,612
Seven!

55
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,054
4... 6...

56
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,754
9... 8... 10...

57
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,074
Go!

58
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,951
Milo don't run! Then you'll sweat
and you have a cold!

59
00:05:46,071 --> 00:05:47,954
That's not fair, you left before me!

60
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,076
Dad!

61
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,164
How are you...

62
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:14,525
sweet-heart.

63
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,619
Well...
Did you leave mum in London?

64
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,183
Yes.

65
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:18,875
Why?

66
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,834
She still had some things to do.

67
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:22,760
-When will she get back?
-Soon.

68
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,139
Soon.

69
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,004
In how many days?

70
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,324
Oh...

71
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,113
Two...three...

72
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:32,469
How were you at Gill's?

73
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:33,713
Really well.

74
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:34,914
What are you saying?!

75
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,647
"Stop that baby,
be quiet baby...

76
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,566
don't speak baby
don't touch baby..."

77
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:39,901
And you would stop wouldn't you?

78
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:42,610
Look at him, Mr. Consul,
poor baby.

79
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:44,154
If only you were there daddy...

80
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,502
He chased lions...

81
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:50,357
then he fell from the north pole
and ripped his shirt

82
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,960
Good morning children!

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,840
No. No injection!

84
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,768
No Milo!

85
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,237
No, no, no!

86
00:06:58,562 --> 00:07:00,927
-I'll take it orally
-No Milo

87
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,190
It's only your nanny.
Look at her

88
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,262
Treasure!

89
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:07,034
She's dressed for injection

90
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:08,503
-Oh no.
-Come on, come on.

91
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:11,916
Here.

92
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,341
I present you my two children...
This is Emilo...

93
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,419
this is Andrea.

94
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,151
This is Luisa

95
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,078
What's she for?

96
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,398
Wel...

97
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,179
She has to clothe you,
feed you...

98
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,488
she'll keep you company...

99
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,808
and...

100
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,109
she will play with you.

101
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,479
I'm going to play with Andrea.

102
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,156
Come on.

103
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:40,220
If she does everything,
then what will mother do when she returns.

104
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:41,937
I know we will immediately get on

105
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,924
and that Milo will now give me a kiss.

106
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:45,641
Here it is!

107
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:46,889
But why?

108
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,545
She's good you know...

109
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,281
and she knows so many nice games.

110
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,601
So many!

111
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,611
-Just like Mary Poppins?
-Of course!

112
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,944
Do you have a magic bag?

113
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:03,637
I have a bag,
even if it isn't magical.

114
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,842
I'll be with you a little.
Will you give her your hand?

115
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,548
Of course he'll give me it.

116
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,285
Well done!
What a treasure!

117
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,936
You also come Andrea!

118
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:16,695
No Andrea.
You wait.

119
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:18,679
I have to speak with him a moment.

120
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,163
Milo, go over there, be good.

121
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:21,823
I have to tell you something.

122
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,156
It's not easy for me...

123
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:45,968
To tell you what I have to say.

124
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:47,991
You saw...

125
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,039
I had to hire a nanny.

126
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:55,503
From now on it won't be the same,
here at home

127
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:18,658
When I sent you to Gill's house...

128
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:22,848
I told had them tell you...

129
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,435
that mother had to suddenly leave.

130
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,774
And it wasn't true.

131
00:09:30,856 --> 00:09:32,916
Instead she was here at home.

132
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,860
Sick...

133
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,150
and...

134
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,929
and during your absence...

135
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:42,856
she got worse.

136
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,575
And now...

137
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,599
you see Andrea...

138
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,078
I know.

139
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,453
The Gills said it quietly...

140
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,266
but I heard them anyway.

141
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,231
Stop that!

142
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,597
Better that way Andrea.

143
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,707
It gives me pleasure
this courage of yours.

144
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,798
I knew you were strong in fact...

145
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,973
I had decided to tell you that...

146
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,594
mother is no more.

147
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,316
But until now I didn't imagine.

148
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,926
Better that way...

149
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,666
everything will be easier in your life.

150
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:44,852
There is only one thing
you have to promise me...

151
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:47,823
Yes father.

152
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,957
That you won't tell Milo anything.

153
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:54,277
No father.

154
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,740
Promise?

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,640
Promise.

156
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,529
Now go.

157
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,730
You can go.

158
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:12,900
I think you need a nice bath no?

159
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,220
Yes father.

160
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,664
I know Will...

161
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,068
that if you had been able
you would have come.

162
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:38,491
Don't worry about it.

163
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,758
She smiled until the last you know...

164
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,971
I still can't believe it.

165
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:47,654
The children?

166
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:50,065
No Will.

167
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,063
They're children.
What do you think they'll hear

168
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,150
Mummy! The tow...

169
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,502
Daddy isn't here?

170
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,405
No. He had to stay in the office.

171
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:30,820
He was waiting for a call from London.

172
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,698
Bye English!

173
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,284
Go!
Quick get on!

174
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:44,516
Franzini! Get down
if you have the courage!

175
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,874
No! You get down instead!
I'll get you off with punches!

176
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,072
Always you!

177
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,559
But even you Franzini!

178
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:54,421
Give me my hat you idiot!

179
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,741
Here's your hat!

180
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,893
Sir. Don't bother. Just forget it.

181
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,216
Done!

182
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,367
Please stop by the stationary shop
on Via Maggio.

183
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:12,687
Of course.

184
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:16,308
By the way, would you have
180 lire to lend me?

185
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:17,936
Yes Sir!

186
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,452
Come on my love...

187
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,722
this is for the love of Jesus...
come on!

188
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:28,176
But they don't make Jesus eat
this disgusting stuff!

189
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,341
Careful! It will spill!

190
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,268
Here he is! Here he is!

191
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,098
Hi Milo!

192
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,620
Close it. There's a draft.

193
00:13:45,337 --> 00:13:46,539
-You have it?
-Yes

194
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,999
Come on love, eat up.

195
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,231
Andrea, go away. Let him eat in peace.

196
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,589
Come on, eat up,
it will make you feel better.

197
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,584
No. I don't like it, I'm not hungry
and I don't feel like it.

198
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,114
Do what you like then.

199
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:01,976
I will show your father
how much food you left.

200
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,097
Andrea, don't close the door...

201
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:07,636
don't put yourself out.

202
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,203
You see how good I was.
I ate it all.

203
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,792
-You ate it.
-No!

204
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:17,094
Funny.

205
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:18,845
What do you think you've done?

206
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:20,409
Milo has to nourish himself.

207
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,859
It had supplements.

208
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,493
It was disgusting.

209
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,221
He's right! What do you feed him?

210
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,311
Good. Show him your example.

211
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:32,383
I will also tell your father about you.
Milo!

212
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,159
But it's two days I have no fever.

213
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,009
now let's check eh?

214
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,757
Andrea has a neck wound!

215
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,741
Yes. This morning I fought someone.

216
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:50,343
He caled me "English".

217
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,461
Why aren't you English?

218
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,167
Yes. But when they tell you
it's an insult.

219
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:57,838
Very impressive.
Go and disinfect it at least.

220
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,019
-Look how cool!
-Is it stratospheric?

221
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,080
Of course. It cost 180 lire.

222
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,400
Come on!

223
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:19,092
Quick! Get the counter-weight!

224
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,030
-Hey. Careful about the thermometre!
-I'm holding it.

225
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,350
Well done!

226
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:27,541
Here...

227
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,558
-Do you have matches?
-Of course.

228
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,970
Against the wind!

229
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:39,571
Ready for take-off. Go!
10 - 9 - 8 - 7...

230
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,089
What are you doing idiot! Look!
- 3 - 2 - 1...

231
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,642
Perfect take-off.

232
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:46,569
It went at least 1000 metres

233
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:49,145
It hit a cloud.

234
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,579
What are you doing with the window open?

235
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,224
You've gone crazy Andrea!

236
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,342
You want him to get pneumonia!

237
00:15:56,462 --> 00:15:57,868
Come my little star...

238
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:59,188
You close the window!

239
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,191
Oh! The thermometre!

240
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,435
Here it is!

241
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:05,389
Did it break?

242
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,208
No because I took it out.
But if I hadn't been fast...

243
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,374
Why you laughing?
It was your fault you know?

244
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:13,851
-My fault?
-Yes yours. Only yours.

245
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,733
There you see...

246
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:17,056
You made his temperature come back.
37.4.

247
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,129
Let me see!

248
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,509
Andrea give me the thermometre!

249
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:21,978
Exactly 37.

250
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,382
You're a liar!

251
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,976
I'm better! I'm better! Hurray!

252
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:30,792
Go back to bed! You still have a fever!
You have to be in bed, sleeping!

253
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,925
Andrea. Don't touch!
Mum.

254
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,958
Dad is not even coming today?

255
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,335
He phoned just a moment ago.
He'll dine out with some guests.

256
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,819
Sir. You're not hungry?

257
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:34,108
Absolutely!

258
00:17:58,673 --> 00:18:00,142
Where you going with that?

259
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:01,462
To eat it.

260
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,120
Where?

261
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,074
With Milo.

262
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,232
No way!

263
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:06,607
Milo has to rest now.

264
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,763
Yes Andrea! Come eat here!

265
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:10,346
Shut up! Sleep!

266
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,873
I'm not tired!

267
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,506
And you go away immediately.
Go back to the dining hall.

268
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,605
-I don't feel like eating alone
-Come Andrea!

269
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,199
Listen Andrea.
I have to do my job here.

270
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,746
Your father wants Milo to rest
in the afternoon...

271
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:24,226
and I have to respect his orders.
Understood?

272
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:25,790
And even you.

273
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,278
-OK
-Good.

274
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:36,658
-Now stop Milo! Sleep!
-Come Andrea!

275
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,699
Your brother was wise, you saw?

276
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,793
You go away! Andrea!

277
00:18:41,174 --> 00:18:44,036
Sleep Milo. We'll be together later.

278
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,718
-Calm down!
-No. Go away!

279
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,324
Don't touch me! I won't sleep anyway!

280
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:52,436
I want Andrea!

281
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:55,184
You can shout until
tomorrow evening if you want!

282
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,817
You can shout
until tomorrow morning...

283
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,259
I won't get you up until you've slept.

284
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,301
I want Andrea!

285
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:04,564
Stop it!

286
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:06,334
That's enough Milo!

287
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,675
A black crow...

288
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,613
was perched on the highest branch...

289
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,673
of a large tree...

290
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:22,805
with a nice piece of cheese
in it's beak.

291
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:27,593
A small hungry elephant came along...

292
00:20:28,948 --> 00:20:33,012
"Throw me your cheese crow",
said the little elephant...

293
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,115
or I will make you have a nice shower.

294
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,389
But the crow didn't let himself
be intimidated...

295
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,030
and so...

296
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,143
the elephant's trunk launched...

297
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:55,748
A large... jet... of water...

298
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,017
But I'm still not sleeping.

299
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,416
The elephant had a good laugh...

300
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:06,903
and left.

301
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:11,698
Then a starving tiger came along...

302
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,502
"Fly down to me",

303
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:16,448
said the tiger sweetly.

304
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,234
Place your cheese on my nose...

305
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:23,458
and I will show you a wonderful game.

306
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:27,789
But the crow didn't move.

307
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,072
Because...

308
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:32,490
he didn't trust the tiger.

309
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,427
Don't turn it off.
I'm still not sleepy.

310
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:48,747
And how come Andrea?

311
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:49,874
It's late.

312
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,187
I don't know.

313
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,248
Can you stay here a little more?

314
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,383
You want to know how the tale ends eh?

315
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:03,219
No. I can't believe it Andrea.

316
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,641
You're big now no?

317
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,357
Yes father.

318
00:22:17,718 --> 00:22:19,759
You want to know why you can't sleep?

319
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,315
Because you're upset about
what you did today.

320
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:23,635
What did I do?

321
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:25,730
You didn't do anything to Milo?

322
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,864
He was anxious all day long.

323
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:30,592
He didn't want to sleep
until I'd come back.

324
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:34,236
You saw how long it took him to fall asleep.
Why do you do these things Andrea?

325
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:36,106
You know it's bad for him.

326
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,361
It's the fault of that...Witch, daddy.

327
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,612
-Come on Andrea
-Yes daddy!

328
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,520
I'll tell you a good one now.

329
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,657
Milo didn't have a fever today.

330
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,127
I saw the thermometre.

331
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:50,179
But that woman invented that,
to keep him in bed.

332
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,079
If I took care of Milo
he wouldn't get ill again.

333
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,445
Don't be silly Andrea.
Now go to sleep.

334
00:22:55,565 --> 00:22:56,952
What you don't believe me?!

335
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:58,789
About the fever yes, of course.

336
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:01,174
But maybe you saw badly. Good night.

337
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,710
Good night.

338
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,067
Daddy...

339
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:11,784
tomorrow, there's the judo tournament.

340
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,292
Can you come and see me?

341
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:14,384
Tomorrow?

342
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,554
-I don't think I'll be able to Andrea
-Dad!

343
00:23:16,674 --> 00:23:18,977
But all the parents are there dad...

344
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:21,001
OK

345
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,999
As soon it will be possible Andrea.

346
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:26,643
But I can't tell the Irish Consul that...

347
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,971
the consul isn't here,
he went to his son's judo contest.

348
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,303
Don't you think?

349
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,144
Yes daddy.

350
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:34,747
Good night

351
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,163
Maybe tomorrow I would have won daddy.

352
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,556
Good night!

353
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,511
Fight!

354
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,792
Bussi wins.

355
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:02,754
Fanzini. Duncombe.

356
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:05,385
Salute.

357
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,151
Fight.

358
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,746
Well done Franzini!

359
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,103
Go English!

360
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,662
Franzini wins!

361
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,193
Salute.

362
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,410
Ah, it's you.

363
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:36,159
What do you want?
Why aren't you in bed?

364
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,344
Listen dad...
I have to explain something to you

365
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:40,664
Today I lost but...

366
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:43,043
but I was winning.
Even you saw that when you came no?

367
00:25:43,163 --> 00:25:44,363
Came where?

368
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:45,712
To the Judo!

369
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:47,531
Oh yes...

370
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:48,900
but don't shout. Stay calm.

371
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,220
How can I be calm!?

372
00:25:50,222 --> 00:25:52,789
I had already almost got his back
on the carpet...

373
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:55,155
there was nothing left,
nothing, but then...

374
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:57,063
then you came and then...

375
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,543
You mean it was better
if I hadn't come?

376
00:25:59,663 --> 00:26:01,470
But no! You don't understand!

377
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:03,340
You told me you wouldn't come...

378
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,229
so I wasn't waiting for you any more...

379
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,671
but you came and I suddenly saw you...

380
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,655
so Franzini took the opportunity...

381
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,792
to slip from under and come on top...

382
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,001
but I gave it everything Dad.
Everything...

383
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:16,424
just that my arms wouldn't hold me,
they shook...

384
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:19,915
they weren't shaking,
just that they couldn't hold me.

385
00:26:20,716 --> 00:26:23,006
You're really upset about losing?

386
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:25,239
No no it's not that, yes also...

387
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,280
just that it makes me angry...

388
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,169
Anyway it's not serious.

389
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,611
In fact. You have to also learn to lose.

390
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,366
You'll win next time...

391
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:35,822
when I won't be there.

392
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,274
Yes Dad.

393
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:45,031
Now go back to sleep.

394
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,860
Good night.

395
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:52,299
-I disturbed you didn't I?
-No. Not at all.

396
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:58,669
You were working with the recorder?

397
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:02,409
Well. Good night.

398
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,734
Good night.

399
00:27:15,462 --> 00:27:16,458
John...

400
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,667
why you inside with this nice sun?

401
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:19,987
Come into the garden.

402
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:21,246
You come here.

403
00:27:23,055 --> 00:27:25,420
What did you do?
Your hair's a mess.

404
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,221
I was on the swing with Andrea.

405
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:30,567
What is it, a tape recorder?

406
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:31,887
Yes.

407
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,372
But it's on!

408
00:27:33,773 --> 00:27:35,604
It's recording everything we say?

409
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:36,924
Yes.

410
00:27:37,247 --> 00:27:39,097
Come on say something. Speak.

411
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,471
What should I say?

412
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,436
Recite a poem.

413
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,075
Mine?

414
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:45,813
But I can't recite.

415
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,369
That doesn't matter...

416
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,621
Then...wait...read.

417
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:52,616
Try to read this, with feeling though.

418
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:53,517
What is it?

419
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:56,260
No. Not Eliot. How can I?

420
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,911
-Come on. You're embarrased with me?
-OK, I'll try.

421
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,243
That's good.

422
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:26,286
What do you want? Be quiet. Sleep.

423
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,509
I can't. I'm scared.

424
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,777
Of what? There's the lightening
conductor no?

425
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:38,097
Yes I know...

426
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,551
but I'm scared anyway.

427
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:45,244
Put your head under the pillow then.

428
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:55,308
Help I'm drowing! I'm drowing.

429
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,608
OK. OK. Come into my bed.

430
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:22,880
I'm scared even with you.
I want mum.

431
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Stop it.

432
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:26,998
I want mum...

433
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,660
why doesn't she come back?

434
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,034
you always say she'll be back...

435
00:29:30,154 --> 00:29:31,426
and she never does.

436
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,072
I want her.

437
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,285
Stop it.

438
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:37,195
Mum has things to do.

439
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,934
Things to do, to do,
always things to do.

440
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:42,535
Where is she?

441
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,064
Where do you think?

442
00:29:44,636 --> 00:29:45,838
In a place.

443
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,463
Damn how tiresome you are.

444
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,783
What place?

445
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:52,704
A villa.

446
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:54,814
A marvelous villa.

447
00:29:57,943 --> 00:29:59,870
With a big green lawn.

448
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,326
And there's also a lake...

449
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,270
with swans.

450
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:09,305
And then the stables...

451
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:11,881
with so many horses.

452
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,208
And sunday...

453
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,680
they go hunting foxes...

454
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,760
in the middle of the woods.

455
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:23,461
Like the paintings in the corridor?

456
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:24,466
Yes.

457
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,667
Well done.

458
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,615
And what's mum doing there?

459
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,219
Mum?

460
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,590
Mum...

461
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:38,090
does what she did here with us.

462
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,638
She prepares breakfast
with buttered bread...

463
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:44,996
she puts lipstick on.

464
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:47,467
and everyone obeys her because...

465
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:48,860
she's beautiful.

466
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,790
But then why doesn't she do that here.
Does she not think of us?

467
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,110
Of course...

468
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:56,014
of course she thinks of us.

469
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:57,584
only that...

470
00:30:58,502 --> 00:31:00,200
only she can't...

471
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:04,357
Dad!

472
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,979
Milo.

473
00:31:06,753 --> 00:31:08,813
I want to go to your bed

474
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,503
No darling, you can't,
don't be a nuisance...

475
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:12,896
you have to sleep in your bed.

476
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:16,006
I want to be in your bed,
not in mine!

477
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,254
Come on, be good little fish...

478
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:20,685
I'm scared of thunder...

479
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:22,440
Yes I'm scared of thunder.

480
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,558
-There is no more thunder. It's over
-Yes. It's still here.

481
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,446
No it went away, listen.

482
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:29,646
Now you lie here and
you'll fall asleep immediately...

483
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:35,637
I want mum.

484
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,304
Mum is dead.

485
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:51,475
What did you tell him?

486
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:53,535
Nothing Dad. I promise, nothing!

487
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:59,033
Come sweetheart, come with me.

488
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:04,692
Dad!

489
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,877
He doesn't believe me. Why?

490
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,707
Why doesn't Dad want to believe me?

491
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,027
Why?

492
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,446
Come on, count!

493
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,612
1... 2... 3... 4...

494
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:33,220
5...

495
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,409
7...

496
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,610
9...

497
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,571
8... 10...

498
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,819
12... 13...

499
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,230
15... 17...

500
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,167
Lady, what comes after 17?

501
00:33:45,856 --> 00:33:47,270
What did you say?

502
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:48,941
Milo!

503
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:52,780
Please stay there!
Wait, I'm coming!

504
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:55,372
Mind out!

505
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,427
Stop it!

506
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,175
What comes after 17?

507
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:01,659
Milo, for the love of baby Jesus,
get down!

508
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:04,033
You get angry with baby Jesus!

509
00:34:04,428 --> 00:34:07,202
Come on! Tell me what comes after 17!

510
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:09,558
I don't know. Who put you up there?

511
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:11,842
Andrea. I'm the stopwatch.

512
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,162
Andrea.

513
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:15,132
Andrea. Get down...

514
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:18,376
Milo! It doesn't count.
I met a wounded horse on the course!

515
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,881
Go. Start again!

516
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,380
1... 2...

517
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:30,998
Watch out for the wounded horse Andrea!

518
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:37,796
Andrea, I order you to stop!

519
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,710
-That's an order, understood?
-What's after 22?

520
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,903
Stop immediately! Andrea!

521
00:34:46,111 --> 00:34:49,066
Now I want to see if you're
brave enough to run me over!

522
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,386
Get out the way!

523
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:53,931
Get out the way idiot! Get out!

524
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,253
Don't fall!

525
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,077
I could have killed you.

526
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,612
Yes idiot, it would have been
better if he had!

527
00:35:03,452 --> 00:35:05,863
Yes, idiot, idiot and idiot!

528
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:09,181
Just look at this indiot!

529
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,410
She made me even break my bike.

530
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,455
Lady, help me down, I want to go!

530
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,355
I've had enough! I'm going.
Your Dad will have to find another.

531
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,748
I can't stand it any more!

532
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:25,464
Stay there Milo. I'm coming.

533
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:28,177
Come on, put your feet here...

534
00:35:28,297 --> 00:35:31,730
Andrea, you did well. Very well.
She's really an idiot.

535
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,229
Mum was always happy
when I went fast on my bike.

536
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:36,461
Really!?

537
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:37,973
She would urge me on...

538
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,366
Quicker Andrea, come on... pedal!

539
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,052
Come on, you have to beat the record!

540
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:43,901
And she looked at her watch.

541
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:45,221
And...

542
00:35:45,504 --> 00:35:46,990
she would give me a prize...

543
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,165
Now this idiot.
What right does she have?

544
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,540
-Andrea, shall we make a promise?
-Yes.

545
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,389
-Then promise
-I promise.

546
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:55,467
Well, what did you make me promise?

547
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,784
-I can't remember any more
-Well done!

548
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:02,663
Ah yes, even if she says sorry,
we'll send her away anyway.

549
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:03,960
I promise!

550
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,370
Andrea, did the slap hurt you?

551
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,129
No.

552
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,700
Then can you take me to the lake?

553
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,460
Of course, immediately.
Now we're free anyway.

554
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:21,530
And if another comes,
we'll send her away too.

555
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,868
We'll send them all away
kicking them bums...

556
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:26,765
Milo! Who teaches you
these rude words?

557
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,085
You.

558
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,744
Mum would sit here,
when she brought us to the lake.

559
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:49,297
Sat on the floor?

560
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,943
No. She would bring a folding chair.

561
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,191
Andrea, what was mum like?

562
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:56,004
You don't remember her?

563
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:58,451
Before yes, but now not so much.

564
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:00,956
Well, didn't you see
the portrait in the hall?

564
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,856
Yes.

565
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:04,684
In summer she was like that.
In winter a little paler.

566
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:06,116
When she ran...

567
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:08,345
she was all red, and would laugh...

568
00:37:08,465 --> 00:37:10,714
I remember that she laughed.

569
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,255
She was always happy.

570
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,358
When she played cards, she would cheat!

571
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,043
What did she do?

572
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:19,168
She would cheat,
take two cards instead of one.

573
00:37:19,288 --> 00:37:20,138
Why?

574
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:23,228
Because she wanted to win.
Dad found her out many times...

575
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:26,092
but she would say if she didn't cheat,
she didn't have fun.

576
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,899
You look like her.

577
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,219
Who? Mum?

578
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:35,557
Yes, eyes and mouth, and
when you laugh it's the same.

579
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:42,125
Andrea. What does it mean to be dead?

580
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:47,218
-It's difficult to explain
-Why?

581
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:50,668
Try to close your eyes,
not breath and block your ears.

582
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:54,710
You see. It should be
like that more or less.

583
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,381
No. I can't see anything.

584
00:37:58,614 --> 00:38:00,372
What did you want to see?

585
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,925
Mum.

586
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,244
To see her you'd have to really die.

587
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,456
You know what that branch is?

588
00:38:11,135 --> 00:38:12,693
It's a branch that has fallen

589
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,173
No, it's an audacity-meter.

590
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,987
What is an a-a-audacity-meter?

591
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:19,307
It's this, look!

592
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:21,314
If I hang here, nothing happens.

593
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:23,445
It doesn't creak
because there is no danger...

594
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,774
but if I go a little further
it goes "crack".

595
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:27,469
I've already reached two "cracks"

596
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:29,039
I want to see if I can do three.

597
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,237
if I do three, I beat my own record.

598
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:38,211
Careful Andrea, it went "crack"!

599
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:39,607
Yes! One!

600
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:42,810
Two!

601
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,488
Stop Andrea!

602
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,308
Shut up or I can't hear it!

603
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,319
Come on.

604
00:38:52,689 --> 00:38:53,898
Harder, come on!

605
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:56,365
-I'll do it
-No it's mine

606
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:57,869
Come on then!

607
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,775
You don't have stength?

608
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:02,882
I have more!

609
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,399
Yes, but I spend it!

610
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:06,586
100... 200...

611
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:09,655
Wait!

612
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,411
600... 700...

613
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:13,604
800... 900...

614
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:15,253
1000...

615
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,418
The idiot forgot them.

616
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,801
The idiot? Good!

617
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,208
Anyway...

618
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,966
who's going to see her anymore?

619
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,029
3000.

620
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,705
3100... 3200...

621
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:35,512
5200... 5300...

622
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:37,506
5400... 5500...

623
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:40,675
5800!

624
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,665
-Is that enough?
-Yes.

625
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,315
I think so.

626
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,452
The important thing is
to have a nice idea.

627
00:39:46,572 --> 00:39:47,772
A great one.

628
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:50,839
The price doesn't matter.
Well, wish me good luck!

629
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:56,477
Well? What happened?

630
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,458
What you doing on the floor?
Why you crying?

631
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:01,636
The money is half mine.
Actually more than half.

632
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:04,354
Milo, let's not start please...

633
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,211
I can't take you to Florence...

634
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:08,118
on the rack? Are you crazy?

635
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:11,416
Tomorrow the other one comes,
the new one.

636
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,557
Tomorrow?

637
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:16,562
Yes. And because of you
Dad chose a really strict one.

638
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,687
Andrea, today is
the last day that we two...

639
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,476
that us two can do what we like.

640
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:27,322
Milo, please stop it. Don't insist.

641
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,233
-Be good. Don't cry.
-No, I'll insist.

642
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:32,975
Or cry, but later,
wait for me to leave! Bye!

643
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,209
Get out Milo!

644
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:52,957
Milo, get out the way!
Anyway it's useless...

645
00:41:29,217 --> 00:41:30,417
I found it!

646
00:41:31,603 --> 00:41:34,233
-A pipe, a lovely pipe.
-He doesn't smoke!

647
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:57,697
Who are they?

648
00:41:57,763 --> 00:41:58,859
Two sheriffs...

649
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,063
Milo, don't get distracted...

650
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:03,104
Think hard, we have to find
something to give Dad.

651
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:05,064
An umbrella!

652
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,298
He has four.

653
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:07,824
All of them bought in London.

654
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,993
Mum would always bring them
when she came back

655
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,364
Maybe they're broken.

656
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:12,684
A raincoat!

657
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:14,466
A vest!

658
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,095
Yes, a shirt...

659
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:18,039
what a waste to have a rich Dad.

660
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,201
Damn.

661
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:22,285
We just give him the money and
he buys what he likes!

662
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Ready?

663
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,205
Now it's your turn Milo.
Be still and smile.

664
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:30,525
Stay still.

665
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:37,067
It's the photographers fault...

666
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,907
he said half an hour, then he took two.

667
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:42,649
God, let us arrive a minute...

668
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,183
even just one minute...before Dad.

669
00:42:46,504 --> 00:42:48,423
You're going like a snail.

670
00:42:48,543 --> 00:42:50,417
It went up...you're heavy!

671
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,797
Look at those two Mr. Consul.

672
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:21,187
How Irresponsible...

673
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:25,572
But...

674
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,937
It's Andrea...and Milo is also there!

675
00:43:31,307 --> 00:43:33,675
Andrea, let go of the bus,
let go immediately!

676
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:36,506
You want to kill youself?
Let go I told you!

677
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,126
We'll settle this at home!

678
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:40,818
I don't know what to say Andrea.
I give up.

679
00:43:40,938 --> 00:43:42,799
It's not worth shouting at you!

680
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:45,541
You don't have the slightest
sense of responsibility.

681
00:43:46,576 --> 00:43:47,776
Are you listening?

682
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,092
Yes Dad.

683
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,250
Ok then.

684
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:56,000
From now on, for me,
you can do whatever you like.

685
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:58,019
All the crazy things you want.

686
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:00,000
Anyway it's useless
fighting against you.

687
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,326
But only you...

688
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:02,746
and not with Milo!

689
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,715
Did you understand me?

690
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:06,697
I didn't want to take him Dad...

691
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,568
he wanted to come,
he always follows me.

692
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,572
And why does he follow?
Because he cares for you no?

693
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:16,875
-Yes Dad.
-Whereas you obviously do not.

694
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:21,361
You think you do, but
for you he's a toy, some fun...

695
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:23,857
What do you want?

696
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:27,284
Happy birthday, Dad.

697
00:44:27,404 --> 00:44:29,390
Ah, it's my birthday.

698
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:31,994
True, thanks so much.

699
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:34,562
Open it.

700
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:55,147
[Be Prudent. Don't go Fast]

701
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:57,129
Do you like it Dad?

702
00:45:02,488 --> 00:45:04,993
It's really a magnificent thought...

703
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,906
I am very happy, thank you.

704
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:12,587
We bought it with both our money.

705
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:15,353
-Oh yes?
-But I had more...

706
00:45:15,618 --> 00:45:17,649
Now go though eh? Go over there...

707
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,703
So it's I who should be prudent eh?

708
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:25,934
Send me to college Dad...

709
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:27,254
I'm too naughty.

710
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,014
You're not naughty.

711
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,618
You're just made that way.

712
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,223
Things don't affect you, they slide off...

713
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,354
I didn't even see you suffer when...

714
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,613
then I had said it was lucky
for you to be like that

715
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,545
but be careful
not to exaggerate though.

716
00:45:41,665 --> 00:45:44,112
Because at some point,
without meaning to...

717
00:45:44,232 --> 00:45:46,953
you could really harm your brother...

718
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:49,171
Now go, go...enough.

719
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:57,444
Thanks for the present.

720
00:45:57,701 --> 00:45:59,683
But there is only one present
I want from you.

721
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:02,237
Only one.
Try to be better...

722
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:03,633
at least try.

723
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:04,953
You promise?

724
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:06,199
Yes Dad.

725
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:32,909
Kids! Where did you hide
my right slipper?

726
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:37,167
Hello? Nazi spy has passed...

727
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:38,487
she didn't see me.

728
00:46:38,558 --> 00:46:41,578
OK. Received. Stay alert.
Only shoot if necessary.

729
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:45,791
Operation Martian Base in Space
continues...

730
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:49,243
Seen: mysterious black figure...

731
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,853
seems like a mummy...

732
00:46:51,973 --> 00:46:54,357
probably in a state of hibernation.

733
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:57,023
threatened by a remote-controlled robot!

734
00:46:57,143 --> 00:47:00,150
With... metal fingers...

735
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:03,655
Arriving Lawrence of Arabia and
the White Sheriff...

736
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:05,282
Friends or foes?

737
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:09,112
Attention attention!

738
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:10,676
Dinosaur sighting...

739
00:47:13,638 --> 00:47:14,838
Threatening...

740
00:47:15,237 --> 00:47:16,610
my right foot.

741
00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:29,091
Base. Sighted new mysterious object
in distance...

742
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:30,578
I'll go an explore...

743
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:32,459
Over and out.

744
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:55,418
agent ZK here...

745
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:57,973
Spy X2 here, can I go and pee?

746
00:47:58,093 --> 00:48:01,236
You disturb me for this?
I'm in the middle of action. Go!

747
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,283
Thank you!

748
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:14,097
John!

749
00:48:14,098 --> 00:48:16,246
Why you inside with this nice sun?

750
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:18,725
You come here.

751
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,706
What did yo do?

752
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:23,921
Your hair is a mess

753
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,527
I was on the swing with Andrea.

754
00:48:27,354 --> 00:48:29,159
What is it, a tape recorder?

755
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:30,479
Yes.

756
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,223
Oh God! It's on.

757
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:34,243
And it's recording everything we say?

758
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,563
Yes.

759
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,599
Come on say something. Speak.

760
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:39,696
What should I say?

761
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,247
Recite a poem.

762
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,387
But I can't recite.

763
00:48:44,507 --> 00:48:45,848
That doesn't matter...

764
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,819
Then...wait...read.

765
00:48:48,282 --> 00:48:50,837
Try to read this, with feeling though.

766
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:52,265
What is it?

767
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:54,638
No. Not Eliot. How can I?

768
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:57,948
-Come on. You're embarrased with me?
-OK, I'll try.

769
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,800
That's good.

770
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:33,362
Hello!

771
00:49:33,896 --> 00:49:36,718
Here spy X2, uncle Will has arrived.

772
00:49:37,947 --> 00:49:40,870
For me it's enough
if I can't hear chickens...

773
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,190
or children.

774
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,862
I can get them to pull off
the chicken's neck

775
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,271
But not the children?

776
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,347
Ah, here they are. Come, come in...

777
00:49:49,576 --> 00:49:50,809
Thank you Miss. Judy.

778
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:51,780
This is...

779
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:52,981
Milo.

780
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,555
Milo, what you doing,
who told you you can...?

781
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:56,660
Eat!

782
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,203
Eat. At least your mouth will be busy...

783
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,254
-And this is Andrea.
-Good morning

784
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,574
Hi Andrea.

785
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:06,883
Last time I saw you,
you were this small...

786
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:08,973
You grew.

787
00:50:09,032 --> 00:50:10,232
Well done.

788
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:11,581
Well done, both of you.

789
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:13,094
You go to school?

790
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:15,382
I go to school. He's still small.

791
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:19,226
He's really good.
He has all 9 and 10.

792
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:21,434
Oh my God!
I don't want to believe it!

793
00:50:21,554 --> 00:50:22,385
Why?

794
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,170
Because studying is absolutely...

795
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,380
unnatural.

796
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:26,759
A slow suicide.

797
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:28,977
I study very little. Almost never.

798
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:30,771
How do you manage?

799
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:34,160
Don't tell me you're intelligent
by any chance?

800
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,398
Not particularly.

801
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:37,645
Oh good.

802
00:50:37,646 --> 00:50:38,514
Why?

803
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:40,798
Becuase intelligence, remember child...

804
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,829
is even more dangerous than study.

805
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:45,362
Don't worry Andrea.
Uncle Will is joking.

806
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:48,394
Not at all.
I'm always convinced by what I say.

807
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:53,125
-Enough now!
-It's for Uncle.

808
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:54,445
Thanks my dear.

809
00:50:54,715 --> 00:50:59,134
In any case I realise that as educator
I am of little value.

810
00:50:59,254 --> 00:51:01,168
The truth is I don't like children.

811
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:03,117
And I don't like old people.

812
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:04,541
Andrea, you lack humour.

813
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,148
On the contrary! Nice reply...

814
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:08,266
well done Andrea!

815
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:10,236
Yes, yes, but now go and play.

816
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:12,270
-Yes Father.
-And don't make noise.

817
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,235
Break all you like...

818
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,417
but do it in silence.

819
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:18,784
Let's go Milo.

820
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,390
Uncle Will. What do you have
in all those suitcases?

821
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:45,758
Nothing important.

822
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,200
Just some heads.

823
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,044
-Heads?
-Yes, little children's heads.

824
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:51,597
I collect them.

825
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:54,037
My recorder!
Who touched it Mr. Casilino?

826
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:56,755
-I didn't Mr. Consul
-Someone touched it! A tape disappeared.

827
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,142
I don't know Mr. Consul.

828
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,973
-You know what there is in the suitcases?
-Leave me!

829
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:03,598
Have you gone mad?
Milo did you hurt yourself?

830
00:53:03,718 --> 00:53:06,039
-To my head
-You are crazy Milo.

831
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:08,739
-I didn't touch it Dad!
-You threw him on the ground!

832
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:11,310
No Dad, I didn't touch
your tape recorder.

833
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:14,102
I hope you aren't lying Andrea.

834
00:53:15,563 --> 00:53:16,763
No Dad.

835
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:18,076
I promise.

836
00:53:18,676 --> 00:53:21,486
-Cancelled.
-Cancelled, you know what that means?

837
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:23,576
It's not there anymore. It's gone.

838
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:27,292
Can't you make it return?

839
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,603
How can you if it's not there any more?

840
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:33,028
You must have pressed the wrong button,
but the tape is still good.

841
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:36,504
Try again. Do something.
I'll pay all you like.

842
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:39,536
Nothing to do with paying,
don't you understand?

843
00:53:39,656 --> 00:53:41,987
If it's not there, it's not there.

844
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:44,835
And yet you seem like an intelligent boy.

845
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,469
Come here, boy!

846
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,257
You forgot the tape.

847
00:54:08,135 --> 00:54:09,335
You're crying?

848
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:12,017
What was on that tape?

849
00:54:13,922 --> 00:54:16,030
My mother's voice.

850
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,398
Your mother's voice?

851
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,394
-Yes.
-And you cry?

852
00:54:19,514 --> 00:54:20,669
Why?

853
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:22,223
-Is she dead?
-Yes.

854
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:23,885
Yes?

855
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:27,437
So sorry little one,
but what can I do?

856
00:54:27,557 --> 00:54:28,843
If I was a magician...

857
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:30,581
Come, come poor boy.

858
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:35,742
Calm down, come on.

859
00:54:35,862 --> 00:54:38,386
I'll give you a drop of stuff
and it'll lift you up.

860
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,963
It's strong eh? It burns.

861
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,886
But it's great.

862
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:54,715
In a minute you'll feel like new man.

863
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:56,035
Come, sit here.

864
00:55:00,853 --> 00:55:03,368
You'll feel immediately better,
you'll see.

865
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:08,183
Hello?

866
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:10,634
Yes it's me. What do you want?

867
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,980
OK.

868
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,460
Not today.

869
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,311
Tomorrow. Of course.

870
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,707
He's drunk!

871
00:55:53,408 --> 00:55:56,108
Not in your room.
In mine, it's safer.

872
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,789
Grit your teeth son,
let's not leave traces.

873
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:01,678
No no, not on the carpet.

874
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:03,064
One last effort.

875
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:05,059
Here we are.

876
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,778
If I were you,
I would try to vomit quietly...

877
00:56:12,898 --> 00:56:14,794
otherwise everyone will arrive.

878
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,660
And I promise
you are not a pleasant site.

879
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,502
-Finished?
-Yes.

880
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:28,308
First you filled up...

881
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:30,970
then you emptied.

882
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,842
And now a little on the bed.

883
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:41,348
And now, if your use of reason has
returned, remove for me one curiosity...

884
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:44,840
you get drunk every Thursday,
or today was special?

885
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,003
It's the first time Uncle.

886
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:49,296
Ah well, you started a little quickly.

887
00:56:50,091 --> 00:56:52,828
I know that sometimes
these steps are necessary...

888
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,991
I think you had good motives...

889
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,579
don't ask me Uncle, I won't tell you.

890
00:56:57,699 --> 00:56:59,502
No no, don't worry...

891
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:02,464
There's a tacit agreement
between us drinkers...

892
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:04,757
to respect the others right to get drunk.

893
00:57:08,083 --> 00:57:12,336
Now rest, and try to look presentable
for dinner at least.

894
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:17,735
You know Uncle, it's not true
I don't like old people.

895
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:21,166
And I continue to not like children.

896
00:57:26,227 --> 00:57:29,981
There in that tomb is a preacher,
with a huge beard...

897
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:31,392
with the face of a bandit.

898
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:32,945
There is a poetess...

899
00:57:33,065 --> 00:57:35,534
with her husband, but she's not famous...

900
00:57:35,654 --> 00:57:38,085
a certain Parker,
who isn't in the encyclopedia.

901
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,378
This one's son died 100 years ago...

902
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:43,222
-There is Mum
-You're right at home here.

903
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:45,089
You come often?

904
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,770
Sometimes.

905
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:49,989
Oh Dad, they're here even this time.

906
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,540
Yes.

907
00:57:52,244 --> 00:57:55,110
Cornflowers, she liked so much,
they're always here.

908
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,867
I wonder who brings them.

909
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,693
-Dad shall I go change the water?
-Go.

910
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:17,661
You know what I often think Will?

911
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:21,156
I should have forced her
to take care of herself.

912
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,438
-Maybe...
-Why do you continue to torment yourself?

913
00:58:25,196 --> 00:58:28,191
You couldn't have made her live
under a glass bowl...

914
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:30,318
she would never have been happy

915
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,897
She was like that, John.

916
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:14,355
Look Will.

917
00:59:14,356 --> 00:59:15,735
Look at Andrea.

918
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:18,693
The world could collapse and
he continues to play.

919
00:59:18,813 --> 00:59:20,302
I think you're wrong John.

920
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:23,057
Andrea is like a dog without an owner.

921
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:25,035
Try to caress him...

922
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,292
Andrea is not a dog.

923
00:59:28,262 --> 00:59:29,462
He's a child...

924
00:59:29,473 --> 00:59:31,591
and I expect from him human reactions.

925
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,309
I don't want to offend children or dogs...

926
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:36,934
but they both share the need for an owner.

927
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:40,100
I tried to be a friend to Andrea.

928
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,596
Not friend John, owner.

929
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:46,793
Make him carry a paper in his mouth
and you'll see how happy he'll be.

930
00:59:46,913 --> 00:59:50,348
Oh Will.
Can't you speak seriously even once?

931
00:59:50,468 --> 00:59:51,975
No but I'll shut up.

932
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,194
Anyway you've understood me.

933
01:00:01,786 --> 01:00:03,635
Well Dad? Aren't we going?

934
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,396
Listen Will...

935
01:00:16,516 --> 01:00:18,827
leave me at the Consulate.

936
01:00:19,234 --> 01:00:23,061
You keep the car and go where you like.
I don't know... Florence...

937
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:25,336
Maybe Andrea wants to go on the go-cart.

938
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:28,162
Yes. The go-cart, and I'll watch.

939
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:31,084
I have a group of Nigerian students
for breakfast.

940
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:34,375
You also come, and then at 3
we'll take you to the station?

941
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:52,246
So we'll see you at the restaurant.
Don't pick me up.

942
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:54,206
I'll come directly with the Nigerians.

943
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:55,444
OK.

944
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:56,645
Andrea.

945
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,881
Wouldn't you like to stay with me instead?

946
01:00:59,001 --> 01:01:00,201
Why?

947
01:01:00,213 --> 01:01:02,394
Well, you could help me...

948
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:05,834
you could open my letters,
if you want to of course.

949
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:07,387
Yes, I want to, I want to.

950
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:09,902
Even me, Even I want to come!

951
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:11,935
I want to open the letters.

952
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:13,895
It's boring, it's a job!
Go, go...

953
01:01:14,015 --> 01:01:15,615
we're going to have fun.

954
01:01:15,735 --> 01:01:18,056
Let me get off,
I want to go with Dad.

955
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:24,433
Come.

956
01:01:25,525 --> 01:01:26,513
Listen...

957
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:28,983
wouldn't you have prefered to go
with Milo to the go-cart?

958
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:32,425
No Dad. I prefer to be with you
2 million times!

959
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:35,439
-Let's go?
-Of course.

960
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,648
Where you going?

961
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:44,719
My office is on the ground floor.

962
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:47,043
What, you'd never come here?

963
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:48,216
Never Dad.

964
01:01:48,217 --> 01:01:49,270
Really?

965
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:51,962
Upstairs are the rooms
for receptions and parties.

966
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,822
Here works your father.

967
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:57,468
Make yourself comfortable.

968
01:02:00,408 --> 01:02:01,720
Do you like it?

969
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,309
Yes father.

970
01:02:04,363 --> 01:02:05,768
Sit down. Sit.

971
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:19,387
Did you see the portrait of the queen?

972
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:20,707
The big one.

973
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:22,789
There's a dedicated autograph on it.

974
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,137
To Sir John Edward Duncan.

975
01:02:28,818 --> 01:02:30,187
How much post eh!?

976
01:02:48,657 --> 01:02:51,319
But the portrait we have of mum
at home is nicer.

977
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:53,020
Here she's a bit sad.

978
01:02:54,351 --> 01:02:56,034
Yes. You're right.

979
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,090
She wasn't like that.

980
01:02:58,552 --> 01:03:01,048
-Good morning Mr. Consul.
-Good morning Charles, come in.

981
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:02,675
Did you see the post?

982
01:03:02,795 --> 01:03:04,043
Yes, thank you Charles.

983
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:05,689
Let me introduce my son Andrea.

984
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:07,009
My eldest.

985
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:09,119
Good morning Andrea, how are you?

986
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:13,169
This morning he came here
to give me a hand.

987
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,231
Well done.

988
01:03:14,232 --> 01:03:16,220
I had to open his envelopes.

989
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:20,696
I got distracted Andrea, how stupid of me!

990
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:24,376
That doesn't matter.
Take this pad and ped and go to that table.

991
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:26,354
Take the stool.

992
01:03:26,474 --> 01:03:28,739
Give him a hand please Charles.

993
01:03:29,294 --> 01:03:30,810
I'll dictate a letter.

994
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,696
A very important letter...

995
01:03:32,816 --> 01:03:34,138
to our ambassador in Rome.

996
01:03:34,258 --> 01:03:35,458
Come, sit.

997
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:38,361
-Are you ready?
-Yes Dad.

998
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,506
Good.

999
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:40,857
So good luck.

1000
01:03:41,338 --> 01:03:42,511
Excuse me.

1001
01:03:42,512 --> 01:03:44,019
Thank you Charles

1002
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:46,977
"My dear ambassador...

1003
01:03:47,097 --> 01:03:48,830
I reply to you about...

1004
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:51,456
the projected transfer...

1005
01:03:51,826 --> 01:03:53,250
to another site...

1006
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,189
of the offices of our consulate...

1007
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:57,595
here in Florence.

1008
01:03:58,136 --> 01:03:59,744
There are many problems...

1009
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:02,703
and I would prefer to tell you in person...

1010
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:04,552
during my next visit to Rome.

1011
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:05,920
Slower Dad.

1012
01:04:06,382 --> 01:04:07,935
You're right, sorry.

1013
01:04:10,808 --> 01:04:12,675
-Tell me.
-Yes Dad.

1014
01:04:14,876 --> 01:04:18,389
Saturday, in school,
what important lessons do you have?

1015
01:04:18,913 --> 01:04:20,873
Saturday...

1016
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:22,722
class work in Maths, why?

1017
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:23,766
Because...

1018
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:25,385
...I thought to bring you to Rome with me.

1019
01:04:25,505 --> 01:04:28,750
-But if you have class work...
-Yes Dad. Please!

1020
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,270
We could leave by car
after you get back from school.

1021
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,840
We eat on the way,
and in 3 hours we're in Rome...

1022
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,743
-and we come back sunday evening
-Really Dad. You mean it?

1023
01:04:37,863 --> 01:04:39,444
Of course. Nothing wrong with that.

1024
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:41,396
But you'll have to be
a perfect secretary...

1025
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:43,153
otherwise why should I bring you?

1026
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:44,400
Yes Dad.

1027
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:46,148
In the meantime lets finish this letter.

1028
01:04:46,268 --> 01:04:47,303
Yes Dad.

1029
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:48,755
So. Re-read it.

1030
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:50,105
Where did you get to?

1031
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,122
"Dear Ambassador...

1032
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:55,062
A friend of mine died exactly that way...

1033
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,744
they boiled him...

1034
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:00,405
then they covered him in mayonnaise,
capers and olives...

1035
01:05:00,525 --> 01:05:02,522
a nice portion of salad...

1036
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:05,573
luckily it wasn't a great loss
because he was unfriendly.

1037
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,531
-But we have to tell Dad.
-Better not to.

1038
01:05:08,651 --> 01:05:10,051
Here they are.
Come on Will...

1039
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:12,436
-it's an hour we're looking for you.
-What you doing there?

1040
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:14,951
Come on, quick, we're hungry!

1041
01:05:15,071 --> 01:05:16,375
We worked!

1042
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,168
Come on Milo, come!

1043
01:05:49,466 --> 01:05:51,371
What you doing? Go back to your table.

1044
01:05:51,759 --> 01:05:52,959
Come on!

1045
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:57,755
What is this novelty.
You don't get up from the table, you know.

1046
01:05:59,548 --> 01:06:02,313
And you don't whisper.
If you have something to say...

1047
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:03,635
say it out loud.

1048
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:05,986
So. What did you want to tell Andrea?

1049
01:06:06,106 --> 01:06:07,354
Come on.

1050
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,164
Well?

1051
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:20,644
I can't hear.

1052
01:06:25,587 --> 01:06:28,065
I told you not to speak in a low voice...

1053
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,385
bring it out!

1054
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:31,966
Come on.

1055
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,585
What you scared of?

1056
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,730
Don't worry. No one will eat you.

1057
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,050
That's not true!

1058
01:06:39,052 --> 01:06:41,964
Carnivorous men eat human flesh!

1059
01:06:43,108 --> 01:06:45,696
Milo. What are you saying?
Have you gone mad?

1060
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:48,007
Uncle Will told me.

1061
01:06:48,322 --> 01:06:51,872
They are cannibals, they eat human flesh,
especially...

1062
01:06:52,149 --> 01:06:53,924
if it's tender...h

1063
01:06:58,296 --> 01:06:59,685
and white.

1064
01:07:00,868 --> 01:07:04,159
I'm certain that your Uncle couldn't
have said such a shocking thing.

1065
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:06,082
Do you realise what you've done?

1066
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:07,765
You've offended my guests.

1067
01:07:19,012 --> 01:07:22,858
Why did you get him angry today.
He had promised me something.

1068
01:07:24,226 --> 01:07:26,390
You will see...
Wait...

1069
01:08:35,594 --> 01:08:37,110
Bye!

1070
01:08:38,552 --> 01:08:42,324
They'll roast you, Uncle Will.
On the grill!

1071
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,426
-Andrea, where you going?
-Shh. Sleep!

1072
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,467
Andrea, where you going!?

1073
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:50,929
Milo, what you doing here?
Go back to sleep!

1074
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:52,892
Why you running away from home?

1075
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:56,466
Me? Are you crazy?
Go back to bed or you'll get a cold.

1076
01:10:56,769 --> 01:10:58,046
Go! Come on.

1077
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,991
If you're not running away
why did you take the car?

1078
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:03,935
To wash it. I want to surprise Dad.

1079
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,380
Even I want to surprise him.

1080
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,099
But Dad has been good to me, not to you.
What have you got to do with it?

1081
01:11:09,219 --> 01:11:11,062
Why has he been good?

1082
01:11:11,748 --> 01:11:13,377
He's taking me to Rome.

1083
01:11:13,933 --> 01:11:15,674
I don't believe you.

1084
01:11:15,794 --> 01:11:18,863
Yes. We're going today, after lunch.
Me and him.

1085
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:21,697
I also want to come to Rome.

1086
01:11:22,734 --> 01:11:24,437
But Milo we're going for work.

1087
01:11:24,557 --> 01:11:26,548
He needs a secretary so he's taking me.

1088
01:11:26,668 --> 01:11:29,613
I help him. Please Milo. Go to sleep.

1089
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:31,484
Even I'll help him!

1090
01:11:31,604 --> 01:11:34,354
Shut up! Shut up!
You can't! You're too young!

1091
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:36,028
Even you are young.

1092
01:11:36,148 --> 01:11:38,917
-I'm the eldest son.
-Even I'm the eldest.

1093
01:11:39,037 --> 01:11:40,991
Shut up! Shut up!

1094
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:46,477
Listen Milo. If I let you wash the car
with me will you stop?

1095
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:49,866
Will you stop?

1096
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,381
Yes.

1097
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:54,368
-And then you'll go to sleep?
-What?

1098
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:57,627
And then you'll go to sleep?

1099
01:11:59,312 --> 01:12:00,367
Yes.

1100
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:01,568
What?

1101
01:12:02,756 --> 01:12:03,956
OK.

1102
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:06,876
-Is the water arriving?
-Yes.

1103
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:19,363
Don't come down here, you'll get wet,
and then get a cold.

1104
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:20,683
Stay there.

1105
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:25,508
Now turn it off.

1106
01:12:55,765 --> 01:12:58,320
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

1107
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,969
Why did you wet yourself?

1108
01:13:00,633 --> 01:13:02,337
Come here, I'll dry you.

1109
01:13:02,457 --> 01:13:03,657
Milo, stop!

1110
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,032
Why do you run, why did you wet yourself?

1111
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:10,569
I didn't do it on purpose.

1112
01:13:11,532 --> 01:13:14,514
-Yes, you did it on purpose.
-I didn't do it on purpose.

1113
01:13:14,634 --> 01:13:16,958
Don't talk nonsense Andrea.
Who do you think will believe you?

1114
01:13:17,078 --> 01:13:18,311
Why would he have wet himself?

1115
01:13:18,431 --> 01:13:20,867
-I don't know but he did!
-Not true.

1116
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:23,052
Yes it's true. I saw you perfectly.

1117
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:26,070
And now I'll go and tell Dad.
It's enough that he believes me.

1118
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,569
You can't wake him up now.

1119
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:30,421
Dad got in late.
He said he shouldn't be called before 9.

1120
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:31,522
Before 9?

1121
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:34,125
Doesn't matter.
You tell him when he wakes up.

1122
01:13:34,245 --> 01:13:36,514
Just tell him everything I told you.

1123
01:13:36,634 --> 01:13:39,150
You'll see. He'll believe me.
Now everything has changed.

1124
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:41,465
Yes, and be late for school too.

1125
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:47,557
Well done.
You are even sneezing on purpose now.

1126
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:49,988
Won't you take my temperature.

1127
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:25,987
Miss Judy. Did Dad leave?

1128
01:14:26,107 --> 01:14:26,939
Yes.

1129
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,802
-Left for Rome?
-Yes.

1130
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:31,398
Didn't you explain to him?

1131
01:14:31,518 --> 01:14:34,287
Dad didn't take you to Rome.

1132
01:14:38,037 --> 01:14:41,481
-Why?
-Dad is really angry.

1133
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:44,555
You're dead when he comes back!

1134
01:14:45,222 --> 01:14:48,055
Now I even have a fever.

1135
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:50,836
38.2

1136
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:52,966
Didn't you tell him it was you?

1137
01:14:53,799 --> 01:14:55,169
No.

1138
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:01,854
You see, even I'm the first-born.

1139
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:09,761
Andrea, can you help me glue?

1140
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:19,948
Hello is that the Hotel Excelsior of Rome?

1141
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:21,703
Is...

1142
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,281
His Excellence...

1143
01:15:23,818 --> 01:15:26,540
John Edward Duncombe?

1144
01:15:28,561 --> 01:15:29,987
What did you say?

1145
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:32,783
Yes, tell him his son, he knows me.

1146
01:15:33,913 --> 01:15:36,098
Don't get disturbed.

1147
01:15:47,552 --> 01:15:48,752
Where are you?

1148
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,957
At home Dad.
Good evening Dad.

1149
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,679
First of all,
who gave you permission to call Rome?

1150
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:57,846
I'll pay Dad. For one week,
don't give me pocket money.

1151
01:15:57,966 --> 01:16:01,149
Listen Dad. I don't mind that
you didn't take me to Rome.

1152
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,149
I mind that you believe me.

1153
01:16:03,464 --> 01:16:06,360
This time it's not my fault
if Milo has fever.

1153
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,556
He has a fever?

1154
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:10,749
Yes he does, but only a little.
Miss Judy has called the doctor.

1155
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,212
Yes, I'll call her later.

1156
01:16:13,332 --> 01:16:15,249
Listen Dad, this morning I wanted...

1157
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,989
Yes Dad.
Immediately Dad.

1158
01:16:19,356 --> 01:16:22,393
Miss Judy. Come immediately. Dad is here.

1159
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:24,967
WHat is it Andrea?

1160
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:26,504
Andrea, where are you?

1161
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,337
Where did you end up?

1162
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:30,660
What you doing there?

1163
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,475
Dad on the phone from Rome
wants to speak with you.

1164
01:16:35,827 --> 01:16:37,864
Oh. Good evening Mr. Duncombe.

1165
01:16:38,369 --> 01:16:41,240
Actually I thought I wouldn't disturb you.

1166
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,560
To not worry you.

1167
01:16:42,656 --> 01:16:45,443
-Pass him to me.
-A normal cold like other times.

1168
01:16:45,962 --> 01:16:47,758
Yes. He ordered the usual things...

1169
01:16:47,878 --> 01:16:50,398
and said it's time to take the tonsils out.

1170
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:51,842
Yes, he's sleeping.

1171
01:16:51,962 --> 01:16:53,194
More than an hour ago...

1172
01:16:53,314 --> 01:16:54,750
His fever's going.

1173
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:57,583
no, there's no need to change your plans.

1174
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:58,903
Come when you've decided.

1175
01:16:58,995 --> 01:17:00,838
OK. Don't worry Mr.Duncombe.

1176
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:02,086
Good night Mr...

1177
01:17:02,087 --> 01:17:04,505
Oh sorry. Andrea wanted to speak with you.

1178
01:17:05,986 --> 01:17:08,671
Very well...
Good night Mr. Duncombe.

1179
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,962
He was in a rush.

1180
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:12,925
He says he'll speak with you
when he returns.

1181
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,537
No. Anyway he's not interested.

1182
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:23,020
But if he thinks I'll pay the phone call,
he's crazy!

1183
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:27,095
-Santina. The thermos!
-Here it is.

1184
01:17:27,765 --> 01:17:30,321
Bye Milo. You'll see
how lovely the clinic is...

1185
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:32,506
when you come back
I'll make you a ricotta pudding.

1186
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:34,839
-Mr. Consul. The post.
-Ah. Thanks.

1187
01:17:37,536 --> 01:17:40,499
-Get in the back please.
-Please open the door.

1188
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:48,592
I'll give you my tonsils
so you can put them in alcohol.

1189
01:17:51,118 --> 01:17:52,525
Come back quickly.

1190
01:17:55,525 --> 01:17:56,914
Quick, let's go.

1191
01:18:07,698 --> 01:18:09,439
No, the operation went well...

1192
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:12,515
but now he has to go 15 days to the sea
for the convalescence.

1193
01:18:12,635 --> 01:18:14,570
He's not even coming back for one day.

1194
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,274
After tomorrow
he comes out of the clinic...

1195
01:18:17,394 --> 01:18:19,293
and Dad will accompany him by car...

1196
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:20,914
to Castilloncello. Him and Miss Judy.

1197
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:22,803
And you're not going?

1198
01:18:23,322 --> 01:18:24,655
I have school.

1199
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:30,033
Give here.

1200
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:31,404
Did I burn them?

1201
01:18:31,435 --> 01:18:33,667
No, but it's ironed enough.

1202
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So give me something else.

1203
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,741
Don't you have anything else to do?

1204
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:40,039
Anyway it's late.
It's 7 and I have to close.

1205
01:18:40,576 --> 01:18:41,983
Another 5 minutes...

1206
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:46,242
If the guard passes and sees the
shutter open, it's a 10,000 lire fine.

1207
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:50,168
Go quickly. It's late for you too.
They'll shout at you.

1208
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:52,341
Give me. I'll do it.

1209
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:55,267
No one shouts at me anymore.

1210
01:18:55,638 --> 01:18:57,397
Why, have you become good?

1211
01:18:57,517 --> 01:19:00,860
I don't know. For them it's enough
that I'm not in the way.

1212
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:05,342
You regret the scoldings?

1213
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:07,305
-There you are.
-Thanks.

1214
01:19:08,139 --> 01:19:10,959
Come back when you like.
You keep me company.

1215
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,756
I don't need company.

1216
01:19:17,534 --> 01:19:19,459
I said you would keep it for me.

1217
01:19:19,579 --> 01:19:20,652
OK.

1218
01:19:20,653 --> 01:19:22,672
If I find 2 hours I'll come. Bye.

1219
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,558
Orange juice, beer...

1220
01:19:41,873 --> 01:19:43,077
Can I have a beer?

1221
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:45,941
100 lire thanks.

1222
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:00,940
A popcorn please.

1223
01:20:05,162 --> 01:20:06,792
-How much is it?
-The coke?

1224
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:09,011
-No everything. I'll pay for everything.
-200

1225
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:11,433
There you are.

1226
01:20:12,566 --> 01:20:14,252
-Thank you.
-Your welcome.

1227
01:20:26,296 --> 01:20:28,999
I'm one of those
who if I have my 5 minutes...

1228
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:31,740
I always kick Maria, the waitress...

1229
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,425
and Miss. Judy I send to hell
just as she starts to speak.

1230
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:37,111
And I sent my brother to hospital
by beating him...

1231
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:38,431
What does your Dad say?

1232
01:20:38,527 --> 01:20:40,525
I never see my Dad. Not even for lunch.

1233
01:20:40,645 --> 01:20:42,025
Why, he has a whole day?

1234
01:20:42,145 --> 01:20:44,470
No, he's a politician.
But I have other ideas.

1235
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,488
You know they operated my appendix?

1236
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:47,808
If only you knew!

1237
01:20:47,923 --> 01:20:50,382
They put me to sleep.
But first they tied me.

1238
01:20:50,502 --> 01:20:54,067
With straps. There was gauze,
alcohol, scissors, everything...

1239
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:56,659
What a hospital. My mother has insurance...

1240
01:20:56,779 --> 01:20:58,419
-And your mother?
-Well my mother...

1241
01:20:58,539 --> 01:21:00,416
-Why you don't have one?
-Of course I do.

1242
01:21:00,536 --> 01:21:02,453
But she's always in her room.
She never leaves.

1243
01:21:02,573 --> 01:21:03,841
Why, is she old?

1244
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:05,471
What old? She's 20.

1245
01:21:05,879 --> 01:21:08,119
So she had you when she was 10...

1246
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,508
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know...

1247
01:21:10,628 --> 01:21:14,101
But she... she's the only one
I get on with...

1248
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:17,323
She talks, sings,
and I record her on tape.

1249
01:21:17,924 --> 01:21:19,313
The tape for hair?

1250
01:21:19,433 --> 01:21:21,591
What hair-tape! On the...

1251
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:22,858
recorder.

1252
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,739
I have to go. Bye.

1253
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,258
Wait a little more. We talk, we chat...

1254
01:21:28,378 --> 01:21:29,646
I have to go, bye.

1255
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,756
-Hey, but what's your name?
-Dracula.

1256
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,713
Andrea! I've come back!

1257
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,214
Milo, you got better!

1258
01:22:44,825 --> 01:22:47,214
Yes, how many "cracks" did you get to?

1259
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:48,954
Four. But who did you come with?

1260
01:22:49,074 --> 01:22:50,448
By myself. I escaped...

1261
01:22:50,568 --> 01:22:53,763
Come on Andrea. Do it!
Now I'll come too!

1262
01:22:53,883 --> 01:22:56,985
No Milo. I'm on the limit of safety! No!

1263
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,478
Just until the first "crack".

1264
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,404
Stop! It can't hold both of us!

1265
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:01,811
I'm light.

1266
01:23:01,931 --> 01:23:04,033
They even took my tonsils out.

1267
01:23:04,153 --> 01:23:05,589
Stop! No!...

1268
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:08,145
Mr. Consul, I'm so glad you arrived...

1269
01:23:08,265 --> 01:23:10,510
Miss Judy just called from the villa.
She was very agitated.

1270
01:23:10,513 --> 01:23:11,169
Why?

1271
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,384
I don't know. She didn't tell me.

1272
01:23:12,504 --> 01:23:13,939
She didn't even know herself...

1273
01:23:14,059 --> 01:23:16,328
but it seems that
both children fell in the lake.

1274
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:18,717
Milo. If something happened to Milo...

1275
01:23:18,837 --> 01:23:21,301
No. It's useless to telephone,
no one will reply...

1276
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:24,153
not even Miss Judy is there.
She went to find the children.

1277
01:23:24,273 --> 01:23:25,857
This time he'll pay!

1278
01:23:25,977 --> 01:23:27,177
Run!

1279
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,752
-Milo!
-Dad!

1280
01:23:44,011 --> 01:23:46,271
Milo where are you?
How are you darling?

1281
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:48,419
Are you okay?
God, what a fright!

1282
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:50,262
-Mr. Consul
-Yes?

1283
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:53,725
They climbed up a branch, the branch broke,
and they fell into the water.

1284
01:23:53,845 --> 01:23:56,262
Andrea we took to the little room.

1285
01:23:56,707 --> 01:24:00,207
-What do you mean "you took him"?
-The audacity-metre broke.

1286
01:24:01,048 --> 01:24:02,548
I don't know what that means.

1287
01:24:02,668 --> 01:24:05,140
But come over there, come to Andrea.

1288
01:24:13,108 --> 01:24:14,737
Why did you put him here?

1289
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:17,256
He asked for it.

1290
01:24:17,959 --> 01:24:19,367
The syringe please.

1291
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:50,117
You see... everything went well.

1292
01:24:50,672 --> 01:24:51,872
Milo...

1293
01:24:52,562 --> 01:24:54,321
didn't hurt himself.

1294
01:24:55,232 --> 01:24:57,658
Don't think about it.
You're in a lot of pain...

1295
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:02,825
What's wrong with him, what did you do?

1296
01:25:02,945 --> 01:25:04,621
Be calm Andrea...

1297
01:25:05,102 --> 01:25:07,436
you'll see that in a minute
you won't feel the pain.

1298
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:15,191
Tighten your fist.

1299
01:25:15,222 --> 01:25:16,600
Well done. Like that.

1300
01:25:19,082 --> 01:25:20,282
Excuse me?

1301
01:25:24,943 --> 01:25:27,776
Milo, stay over there.
Andrea has hurt himself.

1302
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,011
Yes son. I'm here.

1303
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,772
You're...

1304
01:25:46,035 --> 01:25:47,721
angry with me?

1305
01:25:48,054 --> 01:25:50,295
No, no Andrea. Why should I be?

1306
01:25:51,369 --> 01:25:54,109
Yes because I knew it was dangerous.

1307
01:25:54,796 --> 01:25:56,685
but only because of that I did it.

1308
01:25:57,573 --> 01:25:59,555
It would help me settle my nerves.

1309
01:26:00,147 --> 01:26:01,407
Nerves? Why?

1310
01:26:04,845 --> 01:26:06,448
No it's not a worsening...

1311
01:26:06,568 --> 01:26:08,253
it's only the effect of the injection.

1312
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,345
He's falling asleep.

1313
01:26:20,283 --> 01:26:21,765
What does he have? Tell me!

1314
01:26:24,927 --> 01:26:26,704
Unfortunately I fear there might be...

1315
01:26:27,038 --> 01:26:29,667
-a lesion to the spinal column.
-What!?

1316
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,261
How is it possible?

1317
01:26:41,367 --> 01:26:44,858
The branch fell on him and
he hit some stones below.

1318
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,765
I don't want to move him.

1319
01:26:47,212 --> 01:26:49,101
We have to x-ray him immediately...

1320
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:50,934
and call a specialist.

1321
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:52,527
Where is the telephone?

1322
01:26:55,545 --> 01:26:57,397
Take the Doctor to my office.

1323
01:26:57,982 --> 01:26:59,182
Come.

1324
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:01,423
No, wait!

1325
01:27:01,519 --> 01:27:02,719
I'll go.

1326
01:27:03,075 --> 01:27:04,194
I'll telephone...

1327
01:27:04,195 --> 01:27:05,908
I want the best, from Rome, Milan...

1328
01:27:06,028 --> 01:27:08,075
from abroad if necessary.
They can fly here.

1329
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,605
He's still agitated.
He asks for you.

1330
01:28:47,628 --> 01:28:49,202
Here Andrea. I'm here.

1331
01:28:51,838 --> 01:28:53,949
Send all those Doctors away.

1332
01:28:54,227 --> 01:28:55,652
Don't call them again.

1333
01:28:55,772 --> 01:28:56,972
Why?

1334
01:28:57,764 --> 01:29:00,264
Because I don't want them.
I don't want them.

1335
01:29:00,838 --> 01:29:03,338
But they're here to cure you.
To heal you.

1336
01:29:04,028 --> 01:29:05,228
They can't.

1337
01:29:05,315 --> 01:29:08,158
-They're not capable.
-Yes, yes Andrea.

1338
01:29:08,278 --> 01:29:10,713
They're the best.
The best in the world.

1339
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:15,584
No Dad, I know what a paralysis
of the lower limbs means.

1340
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,076
I heard them...

1341
01:29:17,077 --> 01:29:18,457
while they were saying it.

1342
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:20,883
I will not...be able to walk again.

1343
01:29:21,003 --> 01:29:24,587
No, no, no. I assure you.
You misunderstood.

1344
01:29:26,749 --> 01:29:27,949
Let's hope.

1345
01:29:52,544 --> 01:29:54,544
Why did you put him in a cage?

1346
01:29:54,933 --> 01:29:56,229
Come up, quiet, quiet...

1347
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:57,970
what you doing here?
Go back to bed.

1348
01:29:58,090 --> 01:29:59,705
-Let's go.
-What's he doing under there?

1349
01:29:59,825 --> 01:30:02,242
-To make him breath...
-Go with Miss Judy.

1350
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:03,742
Let's go Milo.
Be good.

1351
01:30:03,862 --> 01:30:05,742
I have to say good night to Andrea.

1352
01:30:05,862 --> 01:30:07,298
Quiet. I'll give it for you.

1353
01:30:07,418 --> 01:30:09,410
-No me!
-You'll give it when he's better.

1354
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,188
And if he gets better in the daytime?

1355
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:46,056
Promise me one thing...

1356
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,260
What? Anything you want.

1357
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,580
Swear it.

1358
01:30:50,062 --> 01:30:51,262
I swear.

1359
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,951
If I won't be able to walk again,
don't cure me.

1360
01:30:58,562 --> 01:31:01,210
I told you you will walk.
You're already getting better.

1361
01:31:03,455 --> 01:31:05,732
I'm not scared of dying you know?

1362
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:07,992
Even Mum died.

1363
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:10,473
Remove the tent, I don't want it!

1364
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:12,880
You have to be under here love.
It's good for you.

1365
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,039
I don't want it.
I don't want to live without Mum.

1366
01:31:15,354 --> 01:31:17,502
But I am here dear,
I will always be close by...

1367
01:31:17,622 --> 01:31:18,822
always next to you.

1368
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:21,095
No. You only love Milo.

1369
01:31:22,325 --> 01:31:24,992
No. I don't want to live without Mum.

1370
01:31:25,955 --> 01:31:27,974
You never embrace me.

1371
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,734
Mr. Teacher...

1372
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:37,123
I didn't finish the essay...

1373
01:31:37,567 --> 01:31:40,456
It doesn't come...
I don't know what to write anymore...

1374
01:31:40,576 --> 01:31:41,826
I'm sorry.

1375
01:31:45,683 --> 01:31:46,883
Who cares!

1376
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:51,665
It's too strong.

1377
01:31:51,998 --> 01:31:53,202
Too strong.

1378
01:31:55,953 --> 01:31:57,153
It burns.

1379
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,045
It's breaking my ear-drums.

1380
01:32:03,879 --> 01:32:05,079
It's dark.

1381
01:32:05,648 --> 01:32:09,870
Like the tape recorder,
I erased your voice.

1382
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:12,907
Only Dad wanted to listen to it.

1383
01:32:14,518 --> 01:32:15,718
It's the fever.

1384
01:32:15,749 --> 01:32:17,436
I'll give him an injection.

1385
01:32:18,529 --> 01:32:19,729
Only a miracle they said.

1386
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:22,288
If he survives,
he will never move again.

1387
01:32:22,936 --> 01:32:25,640
Paralysed Will, from the waist down.
He's as if dead.

1388
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,763
We can't move him, not even from the sofa.
Not even touch him.

1389
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:31,763
He still has the shirt he had yesterday,
when he was running and jumping.

1390
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:34,596
I messed everything up.

1391
01:32:35,397 --> 01:32:37,545
I thought he was invulnerable, instead...

1392
01:32:38,008 --> 01:32:40,286
Instead... he was weaker.

1393
01:32:40,823 --> 01:32:42,023
And...

1394
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:43,786
now it is he who judges me.

1395
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,397
He thinks I never loved him.

1396
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:50,604
He can't go like this.
Without having me spoken to him.

1397
01:32:51,567 --> 01:32:54,252
But he has so few moments of clarity.

1398
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,648
Hello. ZK here...

1399
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:23,870
I see a very mean animal.

1400
01:33:27,338 --> 01:33:28,727
Here mean animal...

1401
01:33:28,847 --> 01:33:31,171
see good boy to eat.

1402
01:33:35,303 --> 01:33:38,655
-Did he wake up?
-No he's still sleeping, but he seems calm.

1403
01:33:40,025 --> 01:33:41,225
Thank you.

1404
01:33:42,673 --> 01:33:43,877
Mr. Consul.

1405
01:33:43,997 --> 01:33:46,254
Maria told me that since yesterday
you haven't eaten.

1406
01:33:46,374 --> 01:33:48,143
Would you like me to prepare something?

1407
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:51,328
No, I don't want anything. Thanks.

1408
01:33:51,448 --> 01:33:52,680
Milo. Be quiet.

1409
01:33:53,273 --> 01:33:54,717
No. Let him play.

1410
01:33:55,895 --> 01:33:57,729
Go and sleep for an hour.

1411
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,284
I don't want to sleep.
I only want to speak with Andrea.

1412
01:34:01,729 --> 01:34:03,507
Every minute could be the last.

1413
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:09,272
Please go upstairs and
get my electric razor.

1414
01:34:09,568 --> 01:34:10,539
Do you mind?

1415
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,976
Of course no Mr. Consul.

1416
01:34:16,106 --> 01:34:17,458
The notebook...

1417
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:21,717
I want to finish the exam...

1418
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,458
I'm not able to...

1419
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:26,347
Mr. Teacher, I'm not able to...

1420
01:34:27,056 --> 01:34:28,630
It's too hard.

1421
01:34:32,204 --> 01:34:33,833
He always says that in his delirium.

1422
01:34:33,953 --> 01:34:36,074
He always talks of this notebook.

1423
01:34:36,194 --> 01:34:38,074
About this exercise.

1424
01:34:38,357 --> 01:34:40,580
I can't finish it at home.

1425
01:34:41,505 --> 01:34:44,061
Dad... can't help me.

1426
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,421
Why?

1427
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,250
Hi Dad.

1428
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:25,421
Hi son.

1429
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:28,180
You slept you know?

1430
01:35:29,124 --> 01:35:30,324
How do you feel?

1431
01:35:30,337 --> 01:35:31,537
Well.

1432
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:33,658
So so

1433
01:35:36,142 --> 01:35:37,364
What is that?

1434
01:35:38,179 --> 01:35:39,379
This?

1435
01:35:40,271 --> 01:35:41,808
You didn't read it?

1436
01:35:44,056 --> 01:35:47,426
I wanted to read it with you.
I heard you speak about it in your dream.

1437
01:35:47,546 --> 01:35:49,611
You spoke of a homework you couldn't do...

1438
01:35:49,926 --> 01:35:51,556
Maybe I can help you?

1439
01:35:51,676 --> 01:35:53,630
No Dad. Don't read it.

1440
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,056
I didn't finish it.

1441
01:35:55,438 --> 01:35:57,308
I know. Because of that...

1442
01:35:57,771 --> 01:35:59,308
I want to try to help you.

1443
01:35:59,428 --> 01:36:00,697
At least once.

1444
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:02,730
If you want.

1445
01:36:09,565 --> 01:36:11,861
"Describe your best friend, and explain...

1446
01:36:11,981 --> 01:36:14,509
on what your friendship is based."

1447
01:36:15,865 --> 01:36:17,291
"Without any doubt...

1448
01:36:17,828 --> 01:36:19,847
my best friend is my father.

1449
01:36:21,013 --> 01:36:23,032
"Naturally he is much older than me...

1450
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:25,161
but this makes no difference"

1451
01:36:25,709 --> 01:36:28,579
"He's very tall, he's very strong...

1452
01:36:30,005 --> 01:36:33,283
"He can easily pick me up with one arm,
and he speaks many languages"

1453
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:39,144
"Beyond Father-Son,
we are very good friends and...

1454
01:36:39,264 --> 01:36:41,625
our friendship is based on many things"

1455
01:36:44,033 --> 01:36:45,829
"For example we often play together...

1456
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,732
and there is never a secret between us"

1457
01:36:50,121 --> 01:36:53,714
"If sometimes I feel sad,
he immediately understands me..."

1458
01:36:54,232 --> 01:36:56,991
"So he picks me up,
and says to me..."

1459
01:36:59,142 --> 01:37:00,382
Why didn't you finish it?

1460
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:05,030
You never say anything to me.

1461
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:09,100
Do you want us to finish it together?

1462
01:37:10,304 --> 01:37:11,600
I beg you. Let's try.

1463
01:37:15,656 --> 01:37:18,063
-If you want.
-Of course. Immediately.

1464
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:20,903
Let's see how we can continue it...

1465
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:24,459
"He picks me up in his arms...

1466
01:37:25,051 --> 01:37:27,163
and he says "Son...

1467
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,900
"forgive me...

1468
01:37:29,765 --> 01:37:32,839
"because it's not true that your father
has always understood you...

1469
01:37:34,358 --> 01:37:37,858
He was so blinded by his pain,
that he didn't realise...

1470
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:39,178
that...

1471
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:42,534
maybe you suffered even more than him...

1472
01:37:43,127 --> 01:37:44,327
true?

1473
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:50,608
"Dad took a long time to understand this.
Too long.

1474
01:37:51,549 --> 01:37:54,549
"And this is sad... unforgiveable...

1475
01:37:56,141 --> 01:37:58,382
"But from now on we will
really be friends because...

1476
01:37:58,502 --> 01:38:00,345
"because now it's he who asks you...

1477
01:38:00,465 --> 01:38:02,437
"and he's proud to ask you...

1478
01:38:03,263 --> 01:38:05,485
"you are exactly the son
that every father...

1479
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,000
"would want to have...

1480
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:10,078
Is... is that all true Dad?

1481
01:38:12,402 --> 01:38:14,865
You'll see... that I'll get better...

1482
01:38:15,939 --> 01:38:18,680
and I don't care if I can't walk anymore...

1483
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:22,891
But I feel so weak.

1484
01:38:24,169 --> 01:38:27,132
So... even if I don't live...

1485
01:38:27,428 --> 01:38:29,261
don't be sad.

1486
01:38:32,687 --> 01:38:35,501
When mum... left...

1487
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,409
I stayed with you.

1488
01:38:40,002 --> 01:38:42,669
But if Mum wants me now.

1489
01:38:44,428 --> 01:38:45,650
Dad.

1490
01:38:51,501 --> 01:38:55,649
Andrea, I was able to go round the house
with the ball without making a mistake.

1491
01:39:01,742 --> 01:39:04,002
Dad. Has he gone to sleep?

1492
01:39:04,669 --> 01:39:05,869
Yes.

1493
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:09,650
Will he wake if I give him a kiss?

1494
01:39:10,576 --> 01:39:11,776
No.

1495
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:18,299
Go. Go back to play.
