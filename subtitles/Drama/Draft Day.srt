<i>Thirty-two teams, seven rounds,

2

3
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,967

the National Football League.

4
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,087
<i>A day where lives are changed,

5
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,212

6
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,207

7

8
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,216
<i>Of course,

9
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,291
<i>I'm talking about...

10
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,083
Hello.

11
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,291
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,124
Sir?

13
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,207
What is it?

14
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,379
He's waiting in his office.

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,791
What time is it?

16
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,291
4:15.

17
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:09,666
What are we gonna do with it?

18
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,875
Well, we've gone over
this a lot, Walt.

19
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,207
I'm really nervous about
trading away the top pick.

20
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,332
Callahan could be huge.

21
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,583
That's true.

22
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,583
But it might be worth it if
someone's willing to give us

23
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,124
their weight in gold to get him.

24
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,249
What'd the Rams get

25
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,958
when they traded away
number two overall

26
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,624
to the Redskins a few years back?

27
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,457
Three number one picks
and a number two.

28
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,291
Well, shit, that'd work for me.

29
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,541
Nobody's offering us that, Walt.

30
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,087
Look.

31
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,583
Do you want the entire city of
Seattle calling for our heads

32
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,675
because we didn't pick Bo Callahan?

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,082
Our fans know a good deal
when they see one, Tom.

34
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,666
Which is why we're not even
gonna think about doing this

35
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,207
unless we can find someone...

36
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,166
Stupid enough to give
us more than he should.

37
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,249
Exactly.

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,875
So,

39
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,296
who's the most desperate
guy you know?

40
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,999
<i>We got a fun one today,
don't we, fellas?

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,249
<i>Boom, more intrigue this year

42
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,583
<i>than I can remember in a long time.

43
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,583
<i>There's no intrigue at
the number one pick.

44
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,374
<i>Bo Callahan, Wisconsin Badger,
overall number one to Seattle.

45
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,457
<i>That's gotta be a slam dunk.

46
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,749
<i>We haven't had a
quarterback like this

47
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,499
<i>enter the Draft since Andrew Luck.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,875
<i>Right, so you got the
Heisman Trophy winner

49
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:25,457
<i>going to the Seahawks.

50
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:28,207
<i>But what about the other 31 teams?
What are they gonna do?

51
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,791
<i>Who you lookin' at today, Jon? Mel?

52
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,915
<i>I think it's Cleveland
at number seven.

53
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,124
<i>Sonny Weaver Jr., he's gotta have
a lot on his mind this year.

54
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,207
<i>I'm with Mel.

55
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,915
<i>As we all know, Sonny's dad, former
Browns coach Sonny Weaver Sr.,

56
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,499
<i>he's a legend in Cleveland,
he died last week.

57
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,207
<i>This kid, Ray Jennings, Heisman
Trophy finalist his senior year.

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,749
<i>2,159 combined yards,
running the ball,

59
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,833
<i>catching the ball, 22 touchdowns.

60
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,499
<i>He's looking to take
it to the house.

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,416
<i>The only downfall is this guy
got into a little skirmish.

62
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,416
<i>Assault and battery, landed
a kid in the hospital.

63
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,875
<i>But guess what? He was a
model citizen up until then.

64
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,082
<i>And you guys know me.
I'm all about values.

65
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,082
<i>And this kid's number
two on my board.

66
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,332
<i>And when I look at that
incident, I kind of say, "Look.

67
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,624
<i>"It's not medical,
it's not drug-related."

68
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,291
Good morning.

69
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:13,332
<i>So if I got a kid at number two,

70
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,749
<i>and he's slidin' down
towards number seven...

71
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,208
You look nice.

72
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,040
Are you gonna say anything to me?

73
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,291
Anything at all?

74
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,040
Well, it's big.

75
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,382
It's a pretty big thing
we're talkin' about here.

76
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:44,957
Look.

77
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,583
You can understand why
this week, of all weeks,

78
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,583
I might feel just a
little conflicted about

79
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,708
the news I'm suddenly
gonna be a dad.

80
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,124
I know.

81
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,091
Shit timing.

82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,332
Hey!

83
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,212
Hey!

84
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,166
Where are you goin'?

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,124
I need to go to my
place before work.

86
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,082
Look, I'm, uh...

87
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,791
Shit.

88
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,790
Hey, Tom. You're up early.

89
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,583
<i>Well, it is Draft Day.

90
00:06:46,584 --> 00:06:48,166
<i>How're you doin'?

91
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,666
Uh... Well, I'm great.
I'm havin' a great day.

92
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:50,915
How 'bout you?

93
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,667
Well, I'm sittin' here,
eatin' my pancakes,

94
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:56,499
thinkin' about movin' number one.

95
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,790
Really?

96
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,837
<i>Yeah, as you know, Connors did
a great job for us last year.

97
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,790
But Callahan looks like...

98
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,999
Well, hell, Sonny, he's gonna be

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,332
a franchise player for someone.

100
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,208
You'd consider a trade?

101
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,549
I'd consider the right one.

102
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:21,040
Well, Jesus, Tom, at least act
like you called me, all right?

103
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,499
What do you want for it?

104
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,999
I want your first pick this year,
your first-rounder next year,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,666
and your third-rounder
the year after that.

106
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,207
Ouch. Ouch. No, thanks.

107
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,291
I know what it sounds like...

108
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,124
It sounds like you're trying
to take advantage of me.

109
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,583
I would never do that.

110
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,332
Your seventh pick gives you, what?

111
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,957
A running back with a rap sheet?

112
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,457
You don't know who I'm
pickin' seven, Tom.

113
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,624
I'm not gonna sell the
farm for one guy.

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,124
Well...

115
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,425
You should. Your farm sucks.

116
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,291
Pick number one.

117
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,457
Get Bo Callahan.

118
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,541
I got a quarterback.

119
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,041
Brian Drew?

120
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,629
Are you talking about Brian Drew?

121
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,374
Jesus, you're hilarious.

122
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,999
Guy barely made it
through half the season

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,915
before gettin' injured last year.

124
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,082
I have the golden ticket, Sonny.

125
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,459
If I give it to you, you get
to save football in Cleveland.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,546
You have 10 seconds, but
then I gotta go to work.

127
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,504
Enjoy your pancakes, Tom.

128
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,666
<i>Folks, I believe the
word "Clevelander"

129
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,874
<i>comes from the Latin word that means
"to have idiotic hope at all time,"

130
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,249
<i>and don't we ever?

131
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,583
<i>We don't have beaches and
beautiful weather and sunshine

132
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:42,166
<i>and hot babes
roller-skating all over.

133
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,874
<i>You know what we've got?

134
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,541
<i>We got our sports teams.

135
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,166
<i>And that's the only hope we have.

136
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,874
<i>Let me explain to you.

137
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,790
<i>Football was invented 20 miles
down the road in Canton, Ohio.

138
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,748
<i>This is a football town.
It's in our DNA.

139
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,124
<i>No doubt about it.

140
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>To me, losing the team altogether,

141
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:05,832
<i>having the team go and move to
Baltimore, go there and win,

142
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,915
<i>that was so painful for the town.

143
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,962
<i>And then the new expansion
franchise having to come back in.

144
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,416
<i>One of the amazing
things to me is that,

145
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:18,416
<i>in the midst of all of this losing,
people are still hopeful that...

146
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:22,499
<i>- Yeah.
- ...eventually, this is going to be our year.

147
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,249
<i>Maybe to a fault, with the hope.
But that's really all we have.

148
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,457
<i>- Because this is a sports town.
- And I want Sonny Weaver to know...

149
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,249
<i>Sonny, I hope you're listening.
You better be.

150
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,707
<i>Can you please do somethin' tonight
to turn this thing around?

151
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,425
<i>- Otherwise, you will be gone.

152
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,999
Hello?

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,707
Good morning, Mr. Sonny Weaver Jr.

154
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,707
It's your number one
fan, Vontae Mack.

155
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,541
Vontae, how'd you get this number?

156
00:09:48,542 --> 00:09:51,462
You gave it to me. At the Combine.

157
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:53,207
It's all right if I called?

158
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,707
That's all right.
It doesn't matter.

159
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,541
Vontae, the Draft doesn't
start until 8:00.

160
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:59,124
Where are you? New York?

161
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,623
Naw, man.

162
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:02,999
They wanted me up
there at Radio City,

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,670
but I wanted to be here in
Virginia with my grams.

164
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,791
Since she old, she
can't make that trip.

165
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,707
So?

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,915
Who you picking?

167
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,040
If I was you,

168
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,207
I'd take a lightning-quick
middle linebacker

169
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,753
who can murder the gaps in a 3-4.

170
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,124
Totally agree.

171
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,707
You got Reggie Wilson's
number down there in Purdue?

172
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,124
Now, I really don't
find that funny.

173
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,499
Yeah, it's funny, Vontae. You're
just not feelin' it right now.

174
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,665
Look, there's gonna be a lot of ups
and downs before this is all over.

175
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,748
Try and keep a sense of humor.

176
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,707
I ain't stupid.

177
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,665
You don't take me at seven,
I'll drop down to the late teens.

178
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,040
I watch the mock drafts!

179
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,249
I know who takin' who and I
can't afford to fall that far.

180
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,665
I can't take no
late-teens paycheck.

181
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,582
Vontae needs a seven-pick paycheck.

182
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,416
I got a gaggle of nephews
who need to get fed now.

183
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:53,748
I'm taking 'em tumblin'.

184
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:56,207
- Nephews, you love tumbling, yes or no?
- Yes!

185
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,332
See, that's the difference
between them and me.

186
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,832
I do not like tumblin'. Especially
if I'm tumbling 13 picks. Feel me?

187
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,207
<i>Seventh pick...

188
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,253
Listen, I appreciate that,
Vontae, I really do.

189
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,166
- But I gotta go.
<i>- Seventeen or 18...

190
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,882
<i>Then I got tax...

191
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,291
Y'all ready to go?

192
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,374
Yes!

193
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,166
- Y'all ready to tumble?
- Yes!

194
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,416
- Yes?
- Yes!

195
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,292
That's what I want!

196
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:36,374
<i>Hello?

197
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,207
Sonny. Earl Jennings.

198
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,083
- Hey, Earl. You're with your boy today?
- <i>Yeah.

199
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,374
You guys in the Big Apple?

200
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,623
<i>Listen, Sonny.

201
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,332
It's none of my business who
you draft today, all right?

202
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,458
Ray will play for
whoever wants him.

203
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,874
But if you're thinkin'
of pickin' him...

204
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,249
I need you to know that
I raised Ray right.

205
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,707
C'mon, Earl. I know
what the papers say.

206
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,174
<i>I'll have him explain it to you.

207
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,874
<i>What's goin' on, Mr. Weaver?

208
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,915
<i>First of all,

209
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,124
I'm not in a gang.

210
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,416
The guys that were with
me, I grew up with them,

211
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,707
I've known 'em since I was a kid.

212
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,832
But the dudes we ran into,

213
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,249
they were big dudes,
and they came at us.

214
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,207
What was I supposed to
do, just stand there?

215
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,498
Well, they say you whooped
on that kid pretty good, Ray.

216
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:22,874
He's still in the hospital.

217
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,332
<i>He's not a kid.

218
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,915
None of 'em were.
They were grown men.

219
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,416
They should have known
better, Mr. Weaver.

220
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,999
Well, that's not the point.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,795
Did you hurt your hands?

222
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:35,790
<i>You need your hands, Ray.

223
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,461
I know.

224
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,091
I just lost my head.

225
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,041
<i>Did you find it?

226
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:45,082
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,915
Well, good. Now hold on
to it, you understand me?

228
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,416
<i>Yes, sir.

229
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,124
Enjoy today, Ray.

230
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,332
You only get drafted once.

231
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,832
Yes, sir. I appreciate
that, Mr. Weaver.

232
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,590
Ah...

233
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,541
Jesus...

234
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,707
What? What'd he say?

235
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:17,374
I just wanna be a Brown.
Like you, Pop.

236
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,125
Yeah, I want that, too.

237
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,957
But you'll play where you play.
That's the way it works.

238
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,665
I know.

239
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,962
I'm just nervous, man.

240
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,957
You see that? That's
the Dungeon Drop.

241
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,540
Kids waited an hour to take it.

242
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,456
It's exactly 50 feet from the end
of the slide right into the pool.

243
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,999
Huge splash.

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,623
Anybody within shouting distance

245
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:43,456
would've gotten completely soaked.

246
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,623
And people pay for that.

247
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,040
I need you to make a splash,
Sonny. We need to sell tickets.

248
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,166
Well, I'm trying to help you do
that, Anthony, in my own way.

249
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,291
You can help me, by
makin' a splash.

250
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,582
And if you can't do it,
then I have to do it, and...

251
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,670
I don't wanna have
to do that, Sonny.

252
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,423
Just to be clear here, you're
threatening to fire me, right?

253
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,373
Let's talk about the Draft.

254
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,125
What do we need?

255
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,623
I hear a quarterback is
a good thing to have.

256
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,957
- We have Brian Drew.
- Well...

257
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,040
Word on Drew is that he's weak in
the knees. That's what I heard.

258
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,331
Well, that's because
you heard it from me.

259
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,790
We were 6-and-10 last season.

260
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,999
We were 5-and-1 until
Drew went down.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,296
And he went down because
he's weak in the knees.

262
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,498
There's not a quarterback in
this draft after Callahan

263
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,249
that can make a difference
to our team, all right?

264
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,915
And we're way too far
down to get him.

265
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,415
Okay, okay. What else?

266
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,748
Our shiny new head coach

267
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,999
wants a shiny new running back.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,920
Ray Jennings. He's
Cleveland royalty.

269
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,503
I know what Penn wants.

270
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,540
Come on, Anthony, you said
you would stay out of this.

271
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,498
Coach Penn has a Super Bowl ring.

272
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:56,999
He used to coach the
Cowboys, you know?

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,707
He took over for a team
that won the Super Bowl

274
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,707
and then proceeded to
run it into the ground.

275
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,004
Got himself fired. Lucky for us.

276
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,087
The Cowboys really
have great helmets.

277
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:10,753
Well, Anthony, you're the owner. You
can change the helmets if you want.

278
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,832
Look, you just gotta let me
do my job. I mean...

279
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,416
I like Vontae Mack.
He's special. He's different.

280
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,957
He could transform our
defense. Even as a rookie.

281
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,958
Defense doesn't make a splash.

282
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,336
Sonny.

283
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,757
People pay to get wet.

284
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:37,748
<i>Shameful.

285
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:40,249
<i>You're almost glad Coach
Weaver isn't around

286
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,957
<i>to watch his son run this
team into the ground.

287
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,082
<i>I mean, Tone, listen,

288
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,999
<i>this guy comes two years after
supposedly saving San Francisco

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,665
<i>and general manages us
right to a losing season.

290
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:55,290
<i>Then you follow that up the next
season by firing his own father.

291
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,582
<i>Coach Weaver, rest his soul.
Tone, he was football in...

292
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:07,290
- Have we tried everyone?
- Everyone worth asking.

293
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,087
So far, no one's
willin' to overpay.

294
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,920
Shit.

295
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,665
I really thought I could
get Sonny Weaver to bite.

296
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,207
I mean, he just lost his old man...

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,715
Fleece him.

298
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:32,749
Sonny! How can I help you?

299
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,415
Okay. I'm ready to do this, Tom.

300
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:43,758
Our next two number one picks and a
third-rounder for your pick today.

301
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:47,290
Correction. Your next
three first-round picks.

302
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,415
<i>What?

303
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,007
You heard me.

304
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,248
You want me to give you

305
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,248
the Cleveland Browns' first-round
picks for the next three years?

306
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:00,623
That's right.

307
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,790
Well, that's insane, Tom. That...

308
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,248
That wasn't your offer.

309
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:05,957
<i>Well, I changed my offer.

310
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,540
<i>Hell, we live in a different world

311
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,082
<i>than we did a couple of hours ago.

312
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,915
<i>I made you a fair offer and you
told me to enjoy my pancakes.

313
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,623
You think I'm gonna give you my
next three number one picks?

314
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,206
<i>You're panickin', Sonny, and I
intend to take advantage of that.

315
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,753
I'm not panicking.

316
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:25,166
Your next three first-round
picks. Yes or no?

317
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,253
<i>You still there, Sonny?

318
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,957
It's fourth and forever.

319
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm talking fourth
and, like, miles.

320
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,373
Fourth down and 26
yards to go, okay?

321
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:51,040
Everybody's dropped back deep.

322
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,790
Their safeties are
halfway to Abilene,

323
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,832
thinkin' they got this thing iced.

324
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,748
Everybody and their mother,
hell, their grandmothers,

325
00:17:57,749 --> 00:18:01,248
think it's gonna be the deep ball,
the Long Bomb, the Hail Mary.

326
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:05,415
Instead, it's a toss out
to my man Ray Jennings.

327
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,540
And then, boom!

328
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,748
He gets swallowed up by this
huge, ugly nose tackle.

329
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:11,582
The Hee-ha or the Ho-ha.

330
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:14,415
One of those huge
Samoan kids, right?

331
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,456
And when he looks down,
guess what he sees?

332
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,082
Nothin'. 'Cause Ray ain't there.

333
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,290
You know where Ray is?

334
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:24,123
He teleported six feet to the
left and he's off to the races.

335
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:26,415
Every poor Sooner
bastard on the field

336
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,623
is soilin' his Pampers
tryin' to get to him.

337
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:31,582
What does Ray do?
He brings it back! He cuts!

338
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,498
Shimmy, shake-n-bake, and
hurdles over Kyle Danforth.

339
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,957
All-American Kyle
Danforth and he's ghost.

340
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,165
He's a good player.

341
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,498
67 yards. Touchdown. Ballgame.

342
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:44,081
I'm telling you guys.

343
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,331
Ray's dad was a special
player for the Browns,

344
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:48,415
but this kid might be even better.

345
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,790
'Morning, Sonny.

346
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,248
Good morning, guys.

347
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,999
Was just tellin' Jelly
Doughnut and the guys

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,623
my favorite Ray Jennings story

349
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:58,000
'cause they're tellin' me
we have not yet decided.

350
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,290
I mean, we're not seriously
considering anybody else, right?

351
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,962
What are you doing, Sonny?

352
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,123
I just made a trade
with the Seahawks.

353
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:08,875
For?

354
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,917
The number one pick.

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,795
Oh!

356
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,165
You got us Bo Callahan?

357
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,456
Certainly appears that way.

358
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:24,748
Ali, you here?

359
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:26,248
Yes.

360
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,415
Is this gonna screw us
up with the salary cap?

361
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,582
Moving from seven to one?

362
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,540
It's about another $1.5 million

363
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,957
we weren't anticipating
for this year.

364
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:38,128
Maybe an extra $5.5
million in signing bonus.

365
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,127
We have that?

366
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,623
We can make it work.

367
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:43,624
Let me get into it.

368
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,081
- Pretty good news, huh?
- Yeah!

369
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:50,082
Number one pick?

370
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,674
Pretty big! That's great!

371
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,748
I thought we had a QB.

372
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,965
Tell me, what did we give up?

373
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,958
A number one pick this year?

374
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,666
And?

375
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:11,081
First-round pick next year.

376
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,748
Okay, well, that's a lot, but
when you get a chance at

377
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,248
a player like Callahan...

378
00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:16,290
And the year after that.

379
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,086
Three number ones?

380
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,748
You gave up three
consecutive first-rounders?

381
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,081
Sonny, that's our future.

382
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,331
No.

383
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,503
Bo Callahan's our future.

384
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,128
$30 million, Sonny.

385
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,665
Excuse me?

386
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,957
$30 million.

387
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,665
That's what you're paying
me to coach this team

388
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,998
for the next six years.

389
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:39,248
Did it cross your mind, did you
think it might be maybe important

390
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,841
to discuss this
decision with me first?

391
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,832
No.

392
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,082
It's my call.

393
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,915
As you can infer from
Coach Peon's reaction,

394
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,256
I just put all our
asses on the line

395
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:57,879
for a kid I think we all
agree is pretty good.

396
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,039
Until about 10 minutes ago,

397
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,915
I don't think any of us
thought this was possible,

398
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,081
and I seriously doubt that we have

399
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:06,582
looked at him the
way we might have.

400
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,790
That's my fault. All right,
guys? That's on me.

401
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,915
Now that's changed. So if
we go ahead with this,

402
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,748
if we pick him, and
find out tomorrow

403
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,415
that he has got knee problems,
he's got bedwetting problems,

404
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,415
or he's got goddamn OCD,
we're all gonna be fired.

405
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,382
What's beeping?

406
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:25,914
<i>Hello?

407
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:28,336
Am I on the big phone?

408
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,416
<i>Yes, Anthony, you're
on the big phone.

409
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,253
And can everybody hear me?

410
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,665
Good morning, Mr. Molina.

411
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,290
We can hear you.

412
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:40,415
Sonny! I'd like to
congratulate you.

413
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,757
I asked you to make a
splash and you did.

414
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:46,456
Is everybody still there?

415
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:49,081
Anthony, how do you
already know about this?

416
00:21:49,082 --> 00:21:51,582
What can I tell you, my boy?
It's good to be the owner.

417
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,583
I'm about to board my plane.
I'm headin' for New York.

418
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:56,248
You're going to the Draft?

419
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:58,582
No, I'm gonna see <i>Spider-Man,
Turn Off the Dark.

420
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,290
Of course I'm going to the
Draft! We got Bo Callahan!

421
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,582
Is that it?

422
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,082
Yes, sir.

423
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,956
Good.

424
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:09,748
Anthony? Anthony?

425
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:12,665
Sonny, my assistant Heather just
arrived from the equipment manager.

426
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,914
I had a jersey made
up for the young man.

427
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:18,582
I'm gonna hand it to him myself
personally when his name is announced.

428
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,456
Bo Callahan's gonna be
the son I never had.

429
00:22:21,457 --> 00:22:23,081
Anthony, you already have a son.

430
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:25,253
Sonny, nice work!

431
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,498
Well, I guess that's settled.

432
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:31,832
Yeah. It may be.

433
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,956
We're still gonna have to
take another look at this kid

434
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:35,665
and everything there
is to know about him

435
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,131
before I can feel good
about what we just risked.

436
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,291
Meaning all of our jobs?

437
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:44,498
Yes. I do understand
how important it is,

438
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:46,081
but Mr. Weaver is
not here right now.

439
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:49,498
So the best I can do is, I can leave
him a message and get back to you.

440
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,039
Oh, you know, he
actually just walked in.

441
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,498
Can you hold for one
moment, please?

442
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:55,582
- Where's Ali?
- I don't know where Ali is.

443
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,665
She's not in her office. Ali!

444
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,416
I'm right here.

445
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,665
What's he doing here?

446
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,081
This is Rick. He's a new intern.

447
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,956
Yeah. We've met before, actually.

448
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:08,914
He'll be helping you today
because Rhona got mono.

449
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:12,415
I need Keith and Jeremy for
salary cap troubleshooting, so...

450
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,790
Um, I have Adam Schefter from ESPN
on the line. He heard a rumor.

451
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,790
Oh, great. Tell Schefter to
stick his rumor up his...

452
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,506
Sonny...

453
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:25,582
All right. Then tell him I'm not
taking any media calls right now.

454
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,665
Yes, sir.

455
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,290
And what kind of soda did you want?

456
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:29,914
I don't want a goddamn soda, Rich!

457
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,915
Don't yell at him. Thank you, Rick.

458
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,415
Listen, I know you're mad.

459
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,257
I'm not mad.

460
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,290
- And I'm sorry about the thing this morning.
- I'm not mad.

461
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,456
I understand the situation.

462
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,707
Whatever it is that you and I have,

463
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,748
you've been very clear
that it wasn't...

464
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,499
What are you talkin' about, "clear"?
I haven't been clear about anything.

465
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,089
Well...

466
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:57,919
Maybe that's the problem.

467
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:06,753
So, what did you have to give
up for the number one pick?

468
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,789
The first-round pick for
the next three years.

469
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,831
- Wow.
- Yeah, "wow."

470
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:17,498
The other one, you goat!
Get your head outta your ass!

471
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,747
What's going on?

472
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,956
Who the hell is this moron?

473
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,789
This is our new intern, Rick.
What do you want?

474
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,206
I need every tape of Callahan.

475
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:24,415
I have a call for Mr. Weaver.

476
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,747
And suddenly, every tape
of everyone is AWOL

477
00:24:26,748 --> 00:24:28,039
and shit-show Johnny over here

478
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,747
doesn't have a goddamn
clue where they are!

479
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:31,789
Game tape is in the
archives. Chill out.

480
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,747
Chill out? They changed
the punch code!

481
00:24:33,748 --> 00:24:36,456
Okay. I will get it, okay?
I will get the Callahan tapes.

482
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:37,582
For Christ sakes!

483
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,623
Just deal with the call
and handle lunch orders.

484
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:41,623
Don't ever speak to an
intern like that again.

485
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:44,123
Go back in the war room. Your
tapes will be here shortly.

486
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:45,999
Uh, Mr. Weaver.

487
00:24:46,374 --> 00:24:47,498
What?

488
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:50,124
Chris Crawford is on line three.

489
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,747
Crawford!

490
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:53,582
<i>How's my favorite super-agent?

491
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,456
I'm livin' the dream, Sonny Weave.

492
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:58,081
Dreamin' of a magical
wonderland called Cleveland

493
00:24:58,082 --> 00:24:59,914
where my golden-armed quarterback

494
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,206
is gonna make all your
dreams come true.

495
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,290
Yeah. How is my favorite Badger?

496
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:06,665
<i>He's doing great. He's excited.

497
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,998
You know, Bo loves Coach Penn.

498
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,249
He loves the Dawg Pound.

499
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:15,415
And did I mention that Bo loves
playin' in the cold weather?

500
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,956
'Cause Bo loves playin'
in the cold weather.

501
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:19,665
And we both know it's
cold in Cleveland.

502
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,747
<i>I'd love to talk with him, Chris.

503
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:23,998
He's right here. Hold on.

504
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,753
Sonny Weaver. Cleveland.

505
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:32,248
How are you, Mr. Weaver?

506
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,956
I'm doin' fine. How are
you, son? Excited?

507
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:38,253
Well, of course I am.
It's an excitin' day. I can't lie.

508
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,664
Good, good. Well, try and
enjoy this part if you can.

509
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,831
<i>You only get drafted once.

510
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,165
Well, thank you very much,
sir. I appreciate that.

511
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,248
Got a question for you, Bo.

512
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:49,590
Anything, Mr. Weaver. Fire away.

513
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,752
How important is winning to you?

514
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:54,582
Excuse me?

515
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:56,998
Well, I've seen all the tape on you

516
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,331
and talked to everyone
that matters,

517
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:00,664
but that's the thing
I still don't know.

518
00:26:00,665 --> 00:26:03,416
<i>How important is winning to you?

519
00:26:03,915 --> 00:26:06,586
Well, winning is everything, sir.

520
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,998
Everyone says that, Bo.

521
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,465
I suppose they do, sir.

522
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,914
<i>Look, I don't know
what else to tell you.

523
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:19,006
<i>Winning is the only thing
that matters to me.

524
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:25,498
Oh, and by the way, I'd like to offer
my condolences for your father.

525
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,956
Thanks, Bo. Thanks for saying that.

526
00:26:27,957 --> 00:26:29,747
Thank Chris for me.

527
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,165
Talk to you later, pal.

528
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,415
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

529
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,206
Look forward to meetin' you, sir.

530
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:38,998
Great job.

531
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,081
Was I all right?

532
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:42,298
- Cleveland! Yeah.
- Cleveland.

533
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:46,915
Thank you.

534
00:26:49,623 --> 00:26:50,747
Ali?

535
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,752
Great.

536
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,456
Hi, Mom.

537
00:27:01,457 --> 00:27:04,622
You sold a cow for magic beans.

538
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,081
<i>What?

539
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,789
You could have stole
Ray Jennings at seven!

540
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,747
How does the entire world
already know about this, Mom?

541
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:14,081
Because Vontae Mack
just tweeted it.

542
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,415
He tweeted it?

543
00:27:16,582 --> 00:27:18,581
Yeah. Here.

544
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:22,747
"Agent just called. Browns
trade for number one.

545
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:26,956
<i>"Sorry, Cleve.
You get Bo, no Vontae.

546
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:29,582
<i>"Dumb move."

547
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,585
You're on Twitter?

548
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:33,589
You're not?

549
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:37,086
I'm sorry, Sonny.
Is this a bad time?

550
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,747
I gotta go, Mom.

551
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,248
This is the Draft Analysis
we've all been working on

552
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:43,290
for the last two months.

553
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,836
Fire! Ali! Fire!

554
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,914
- Ali! Fire!
- Did you hear that?

555
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,790
I'm coming. God!

556
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,331
Can I get you gentlemen
some coffee?

557
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:02,415
Love some.

558
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,956
Light and sweet, honey. Thanks.

559
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:06,752
Yeah, I'm not getting
you idiots anything.

560
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:12,123
I like her. Little Miss Salary Cap.
She's a sweetheart.

561
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,248
Yeah, she's the best.

562
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,420
Why am I here, Sonny?

563
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,415
Because Molina thinks you
coached the Cowboys.

564
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:18,789
I did coach the Cowboys.

565
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,336
And I think you were
a bad babysitter.

566
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:26,290
You know, my wife loved
livin' in Dallas, Sonny.

567
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,081
It's a rich town
full of fancy people

568
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,914
and she likes that kind of thing.

569
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,998
So she wasn't exactly
thrilled when I said,

570
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:35,664
"Hey, baby, pack your bags.
We're moving to Cleveland."

571
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,581
Well, there's fancy
people here, too.

572
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,956
No.

573
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:41,456
There's really not.
Which is okay by me.

574
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,831
But I dragged my pretty
wife to this town

575
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:46,039
because this city
deserves a championship

576
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,456
and I'm the guy that
can deliver it.

577
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:49,539
Well, then we're on
the same page, Vince.

578
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,622
Oh, yeah?

579
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,123
Then keep me in the loop.

580
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:53,956
There is no loop. All right?

581
00:28:53,957 --> 00:28:56,706
There's me doing my
job, you doing yours.

582
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:58,165
Your job is to coach
the team I give you.

583
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,415
They do it different in Dallas?

584
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:03,041
Yeah, they do. They win. A lot.

585
00:29:04,498 --> 00:29:07,581
I had my choice of teams to coach,
Sonny, and I chose this team, okay?

586
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,998
I chose to coach this team.

587
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,831
Not the team you're puttin'
together in your head, on the fly

588
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,581
'cause your old man died last week

589
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:16,753
and you're tapping
one of your execs.

590
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:18,914
What did you just say?

591
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:21,790
I'm sorry. Is that
supposed to be a secret?

592
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:28,003
You know, around here, we called
my "old man" Coach Weaver.

593
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,331
And yes, my father died last week.

594
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:33,081
So the next time you
refer to his name,

595
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,747
next time you say it, at
least, in front of me,

596
00:29:34,748 --> 00:29:38,748
you say it with some goddamn
reverence, because he earned it.

597
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:41,128
Fair enough?

598
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,673
Keep your legs up now.

599
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:50,165
Don't even think about it.

600
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,794
Sonny Weaver Jr.

601
00:29:56,915 --> 00:29:58,630
<i>Vontae.

602
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:01,331
I'm disappointed in
you, Mr. Weaver.

603
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,455
Let me tell you something, Vontae,

604
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:03,581
and I don't have a lot of time,

605
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:06,174
so I want you to listen
to me carefully, okay?

606
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,248
- Are you listening?
<i>- Yeah.

607
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:09,747
Don't Twitter.

608
00:30:09,748 --> 00:30:12,414
For the love of Jesus, just stop.

609
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:16,373
Delete your profile. Get off the web.
Do not do this to yourself.

610
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,123
I don't know why you
care what I do.

611
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:20,081
I can do whatever I want. Right?

612
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:21,747
Of course you can, Vontae,

613
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:23,331
but every GM in the league
has now read your tweet,

614
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,497
or whatever they call them,

615
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:27,747
and they've all made a mental
note that Vontae Mack,

616
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:31,414
however prodigiously talented, is a
guy who likes to talk, all right?

617
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,914
Who likes to spread rumors,

618
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,581
who's more than willing
to announce to the world

619
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,299
any inane thought that
passes through his head.

620
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:40,206
And be it your God-given
right or not,

621
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,664
Vontae, GM's hate
that shit, all right?

622
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:42,789
We hate it.

623
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,747
You made a mistake, Mr. Weaver.

624
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,497
No, Vontae. I made a deal.

625
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:48,248
And you're gonna be a
great player in the NFL

626
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:49,873
if you don't manage
to sabotage yourself

627
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:51,455
between now and the
end of this day.

628
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:54,081
Now, now, now, now,
that boy you wanna take,

629
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:56,914
that there is a mistake, Callahan.

630
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,414
Callahan's a poser.

631
00:30:58,415 --> 00:30:59,497
Yeah.

632
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:03,914
And what do you know that every
scout and coach on Earth does not?

633
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:07,131
I know he got sacked
12 times last year.

634
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,664
No. It was 11. It was 11 times.

635
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:12,497
Yeah, well, four of 'em
were mine. In one game.

636
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:14,831
Yeah, I remember.
I saw your highlight reel.

637
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,248
I also remember that he beat you.

638
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:19,249
Watch it again.

639
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,998
Don't watch me. Watch him.

640
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:25,290
Watch me sack him four
times in one game.

641
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:28,586
Then watch what happens after.

642
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:32,840
Watch what happens after what?

643
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,294
Just watch.

644
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,586
Jesus Christ.

645
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,790
Jordan, come here.

646
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,836
Do it like you did it at home.

647
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:07,124
Yeah! Nice, nice, nice!

648
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:08,664
'Morning, boss man.

649
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:11,414
Tony Bagel. How's my
favorite strength coach?

650
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,081
Hey, boss. Boss.

651
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:14,831
Did you hear about Brian Drew?

652
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,081
No, what about him?

653
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:18,165
He came in here yesterday,
did a little workout.

654
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,123
Guess how much he squatted?

655
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,330
He's not supposed to be squattin'.

656
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:22,664
Four hundred!

657
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:24,622
Four bills! I know!

658
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:27,081
And what's even more
impressive is his arm.

659
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:28,789
Your star wide
receiver Andre Bello's

660
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,372
been tellin' me about
those secret workouts

661
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,330
they've been doin'
together all winter.

662
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:33,998
You know about those?

663
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,165
Yeah.

664
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:38,747
Yeah, well, Andre thinks Brian can
throw a good 15 yards deeper now.

665
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,914
I didn't believe it until
I saw what he benched.

666
00:32:41,915 --> 00:32:43,123
What did he bench?

667
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:46,497
He benched 250, 25 times.

668
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,747
Just boom-boom!

669
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:53,247
Translation, Brian Drew's in
the best shape of his life.

670
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,914
- Good work.
- Yeah!

671
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:56,747
Let's go for it, boy. C'mon!

672
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:58,123
Pop it!

673
00:32:58,124 --> 00:33:00,919
Snap it up! Yeah! Nice!

674
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:45,081
- This one...
- Yeah... Oh my God, she's hot.

675
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:46,205
I like the one in the red.

676
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,251
She's a babe!

677
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:51,455
How we doin' on Callahan?

678
00:33:51,456 --> 00:33:52,914
You mean in the
weakness department?

679
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:55,706
Yeah, well, he has a weakness
for banging hot chicks, Sonny.

680
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:57,414
I mean, look, he has
a whole website

681
00:33:57,415 --> 00:33:58,581
dedicated to all the
chicks he's smashed.

682
00:33:58,582 --> 00:34:00,423
All right, c'mon.

683
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,956
Somebody's gotta have something.

684
00:34:04,957 --> 00:34:08,247
He doesn't speak French real
good. He got a C-minus.

685
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:09,789
And he used to bite
his fingernails,

686
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,330
but then wait for it,
now he doesn't anymore.

687
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,123
But, Sonny, really, how
many chicks do you think

688
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:15,914
a guy like that sleeps with,
per week, on average?

689
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,914
We were thinkin' 20.
Minimum. Minimum.

690
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:18,998
I say 10.

691
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:21,581
That's 1.5 per day,
which makes sense.

692
00:34:21,582 --> 00:34:23,539
- 2.5 sounds exorbitant.
- Listen, man.

693
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,289
Speaking as a former college
quarterback myself...

694
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,372
Division II.

695
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:28,123
I say he averages,
like, three per day.

696
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:30,498
Right? That's one in the mornin'...

697
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,455
I'm trying very hard
to not completely

698
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,789
lose my shit on all
three of you right now,

699
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,255
but you're not makin' it easy.

700
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:44,330
Sonny, so far, he's still the
best prospect we've ever seen.

701
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,581
Easily, Sonny.

702
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,581
We've been looking, Sonny. I swear.

703
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:49,497
We couldn't find anything
before and we can't now.

704
00:34:49,498 --> 00:34:50,914
No other team could either.

705
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,831
If Callahan can't play
football, nobody can.

706
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:57,003
I get it. I get it. But
look, nobody's perfect.

707
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:00,624
Everybody has something.
Even the great ones. Right?

708
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,873
They said that Montana
was too small,

709
00:35:02,874 --> 00:35:04,956
that he'd get hurt,
he'd get banged up,

710
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:08,172
but that didn't seem
to matter, did it?

711
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,747
<i>A lot of people said that
Elway was too strong,

712
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:16,414
<i>that he threw too hard,
didn't have touch,

713
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,836
<i>but that didn't seem to
matter either, did it?

714
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,747
<i>And pretty much everyone agreed

715
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,122
<i>that Peyton didn't
have the arm strength,

716
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,330
<i>that he couldn't throw deep.

717
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,414
But somehow, none of
it seemed to matter.

718
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,085
You get where I'm going here, guys?

719
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:32,581
We need to find out what Bo
Callahan's "something" is.

720
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:34,581
Then figure out if
it matters or not.

721
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,956
All right? Figure out if it's
somethin' we can live with.

722
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:40,172
- We're on it, Sonny.
- All right, Sonny.

723
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,753
Yo, I bookmarked that page.

724
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,961
<i>I really like this
quarter outta Oklahoma.

725
00:35:48,582 --> 00:35:51,080
His Combine scores
were off the charts.

726
00:35:57,248 --> 00:35:58,581
Hey, Sonny.

727
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,582
<i>What's up?

728
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,747
Got a question for you,
Tom. Straight up.

729
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:04,789
<i>Sure.

730
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,915
Why'd you make the deal?

731
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:09,622
What?

732
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:12,998
This morning, for Callahan.
Why did you make that deal?

733
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,205
The same reason you did.

734
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,956
It's the best thing
for my franchise.

735
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,914
<i>What knock did you
find on Callahan?

736
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,122
Bo! We want Bo!

737
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:21,999
Son of a bitch.

738
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,164
You all right, Tom?
You seem distracted.

739
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,747
We didn't find anything on him.

740
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,247
I'm sure you guys haven't either.

741
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,831
Come on, I already made the
trade. I'm living with that, Tom.

742
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:30,998
<i>I'm not gonna hold it against you.

743
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:32,164
Tom must go!

744
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:33,831
- Tom must go!
<i>- I'd just appreciate it if you could...

745
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:35,752
Sonny, I gotta go.

746
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,080
Hey.

747
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:42,252
I got you Bo Callahan's
scouting reports.

748
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:45,831
Dave, come here.

749
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:48,127
Does that look like me?

750
00:36:52,707 --> 00:36:54,502
- What are you doing?
- Just...

751
00:37:00,623 --> 00:37:04,339
I need two seconds with you in
a place that isn't out there.

752
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:07,172
Okay.

753
00:37:07,623 --> 00:37:10,339
I don't like what's
happening between us.

754
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:12,122
Seeing you all day,
walk the other way,

755
00:37:12,123 --> 00:37:13,539
watching you drive
away this morning,

756
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,039
it's killing me.

757
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:19,248
Look, I know I've disappointed you.

758
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:22,832
And maybe that's not even
a strong enough word.

759
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:25,455
If I didn't handle, if I
didn't have the right words

760
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,747
that you needed to
hear, then I'm...

761
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,914
Look, Sonny, you don't
need to do this.

762
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,414
Let me finish.

763
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,747
Men are supposed to step up.

764
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:34,414
And in the middle of
everything that's going on,

765
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:35,955
I didn't get it right, all right?

766
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,455
I didn't get all gooey.

767
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,831
I didn't jump up and want to know

768
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:40,122
what color to paint the bedroom,

769
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:41,247
you know, blue or pink.

770
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,914
And I wish I was one
of those kind of guys

771
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,873
that know how to make
the wallpaper line up.

772
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:48,581
The Home Depot
Dads-of-the-Year types

773
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:51,414
that make the rest of
us look like assholes.

774
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:55,006
Those guys are not the reason
you look like an asshole.

775
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,664
So I didn't react the
perfect way this morning.

776
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,997
I shouldn't be penalized for that.

777
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:06,419
I know that, Sonny.

778
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,506
I'm not the Mom-of-the-Year
type either.

779
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,664
I don't know how to pack a lunch.
I've never changed a diaper.

780
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:18,790
And God help me, the one thing I
do understand, Sonny, is football.

781
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,330
That's me.

782
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,922
I'm action-oriented.
I'm passionate.

783
00:38:23,998 --> 00:38:27,590
I'm a Cleveland girl,
and I am football.

784
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:32,080
Maybe more than you.
I wasn't born into this game.

785
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:34,047
I had to fight my way in.

786
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:45,122
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I can come back.

787
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,414
I'm gonna come back.

788
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,005
What do you need, Rick?

789
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,922
Brian Drew just
trashed your office.

790
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,913
What?

791
00:38:55,914 --> 00:38:56,955
I told him you were busy

792
00:38:56,956 --> 00:39:00,997
and he told me to have
intercourse with my mother.

793
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:04,581
Which... You know, she passed
away, so... I didn't tell him that.

794
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:07,330
Anyway, he got really mad and
started throwing stuff around,

795
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:10,081
and then he said he was gonna
go down to the locker room.

796
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:13,747
After all that rehab, you're just gonna
quit? You're just gonna walk away?

797
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,247
C'mon, Brian. Don't listen
to Coach. Don't leave.

798
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:16,414
I know what's goin' on here.

799
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,006
Then just compete with him!
Beat him out!

800
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,747
Did you trash my office?

801
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:30,080
Trade me.

802
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,122
Did you just trash my office?

803
00:39:32,123 --> 00:39:34,289
Yeah. I'm upset.

804
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,455
Well, I don't care if you're upset.

805
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,247
If you're upset, call
your agent, all right?

806
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,455
Let him have this conversation.
That's what he's there for.

807
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:41,955
No, Sonny. You're gonna talk to me.
Man-to-man. You owe me that.

808
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:43,289
I owe you?

809
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,414
I drafted you.

810
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,872
Your dad drafted me.

811
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:47,749
No, Drew, I drafted you.

812
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:50,830
I may have been in San Francisco,

813
00:39:50,831 --> 00:39:53,956
but my dad wasn't even looking
at you until I told him to.

814
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:57,581
Yeah, and when your knee crapped
out and no one wanted you,

815
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:58,872
I still extended your contract,

816
00:39:58,873 --> 00:40:00,080
and I think I even
gave you a raise,

817
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,797
because I believed in you.

818
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:04,005
Then why pick Callahan?

819
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,293
You know why.

820
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:08,922
Then trade me.

821
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,247
I'm gonna do what's
best for the team.

822
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:17,164
I've been in this league for eight
seasons. I've been to the playoffs.

823
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,164
I know the system that Penn wants to
run and I know I can make it work.

824
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:23,913
I've busted my ass this off-season.
I set the bar high.

825
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:27,255
I'm in great shape.
I feel 10 years younger.

826
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,955
I'm tellin' you,
man, I swear to you,

827
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:33,297
the best thing for this
team, this season, is me.

828
00:40:33,748 --> 00:40:35,164
Are you finished?

829
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,665
No.

830
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,463
Well, get finished.

831
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:40,913
And then get back to work.

832
00:40:40,914 --> 00:40:44,414
If I trade you, I trade you.
And if I don't, I don't.

833
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:47,913
Do yourself a favor. Worry about
Brian. Don't worry about Bo.

834
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:50,788
And definitely, most absolutely
goddamn importantly,

835
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:53,080
do not bother me with your
shit right now, Brian.

836
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,422
I'm workin' here!

837
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:18,914
Ali!

838
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:22,172
Ali!

839
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,913
Did you hear me, Rick?

840
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:27,581
I heard you. Yeah.

841
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:28,955
Do you think Ali heard me?

842
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:31,081
No, I don't think so. No.

843
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,256
Good answer.

844
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,414
Women are tricky. Problem is,
they're smarter than us.

845
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:40,664
Yeah. Women, they're like...

846
00:42:05,747 --> 00:42:06,997
<i>This is Sonny.

847
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:09,330
Hey, Sonny. It's Pete
Begler with the Chiefs.

848
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:11,081
<i>Hey, Pete. What's up?

849
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:13,247
Well, we're in the market for a QB,

850
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:15,330
and now that you have number one,

851
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:18,081
I was wondering if Brian
Drew's available.

852
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,788
I don't know. Haven't
made up my mind yet.

853
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,247
Is he healthy?

854
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,955
Well, if you're askin' about his
knee, it's stronger than ever.

855
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:28,664
He's throwin' the ball a good 15
yards farther down the field.

856
00:42:28,664 --> 00:42:30,788
Okay. Just confirming.

857
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:33,414
His agent sent over a tape of Drew
working out during the off-season.

858
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:35,247
We like what we see.

859
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,746
He did? That's great.

860
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:39,963
You seem surprised.

861
00:42:41,415 --> 00:42:44,256
Why would I be surprised?

862
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:47,497
Okay, Sonny. You don't have
to play games with me.

863
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,918
What do you want for him?
I'm all ears. Let's talk.

864
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:54,746
Pete, we're still working
out some stuff over here.

865
00:42:54,747 --> 00:42:56,038
Can I get back to you?

866
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,247
Okay.

867
00:42:57,248 --> 00:42:58,998
Thanks.

868
00:43:05,623 --> 00:43:08,164
Hey, Ali. How're you doin'?

869
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:09,746
Are you as jacked as everyone else

870
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:11,330
around here about
gettin' the first pick?

871
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,922
I don't really get jacked,
I just manage the cap.

872
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:15,080
Uh-huh.

873
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:17,955
How does a girl like you
get in this game anyway?

874
00:43:17,956 --> 00:43:19,330
Law school.

875
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:20,788
Lawyer.

876
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:22,746
So you don't get excited
about anything.

877
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:23,788
If I do my job

878
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:25,746
and we haven't spent
more than $125 million

879
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:27,663
<i>on players by the time
the season starts,

880
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:29,755
I get excited.

881
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:33,126
Mind if I sit down?

882
00:43:33,248 --> 00:43:35,668
- I'm busy.
- Won't take long.

883
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:39,006
I could use your help.

884
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,880
Mmm?

885
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,913
The Browns brought me to Cleveland

886
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:47,506
so that everybody could
get one of these.

887
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:50,414
How is it that the ultimate prize

888
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:52,581
in the most macho
sport ever invented

889
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:55,081
is a piece of jewelry?

890
00:43:55,415 --> 00:44:01,414
Yeah. Well, be that as it may,
I need some draft picks back, okay?

891
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:03,330
'Cause there's been some
pretty foolish moves

892
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:05,422
made by your boyfriend.

893
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:09,080
- My boyfriend?
- Please.

894
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,955
You have his ear. I don't.

895
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:13,913
Talk to him. It's not about me.

896
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:16,335
It's about the people of Cleveland.

897
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,080
You don't think Callahan's legit?

898
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,746
I think Callahan might be the
best prospect in the Draft.

899
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:25,205
But I hate rookie quarterbacks.

900
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:27,372
They're stupid and they're scared.

901
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,580
- Not the good ones.
- We already got a good one.

902
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:33,247
His name is Brian Drew. He can
run my offense like a pro.

903
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:35,746
So I'm tryin' to
figure out why I gotta

904
00:44:35,747 --> 00:44:37,330
give away the future
of the franchise

905
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:39,705
and then sit around trying
to teach some rookie,

906
00:44:39,706 --> 00:44:41,497
I don't know, everything, you know?

907
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:43,746
I'm talking shifts,
plays, protections,

908
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,955
snap counts, alerts,
check-with-me's,

909
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:49,455
Double X, jet, ice cream, 36, counter
naked waggle at 16-9 Tennessee Free.

910
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,955
Know what I'm sayin'?

911
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:54,127
Don't patronize me. You know
I know what you're saying.

912
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:58,580
I dedicated my life to
this sport, just like you.

913
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:02,173
And, no, I will not
speak to Sonny for you.

914
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:12,838
<i>Bo Ridley Callahan.

915
00:45:12,914 --> 00:45:14,247
He's an only child.

916
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:17,414
His mom's a homemaker, his father's
a medical malpractice lawyer.

917
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:18,746
He's made some money.

918
00:45:18,747 --> 00:45:21,788
Pays his taxes. He's got three
years left on his mortgage.

919
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:25,247
The kid's pretty vanilla. Belonged
to a few clubs in high school.

920
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:27,746
He had a walk-on role
in <i>Damn Yankees.

921
00:45:27,747 --> 00:45:30,788
He was on the honor roll from
junior high through college.

922
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,455
Kept his nose clean,
he worked out and...

923
00:45:33,456 --> 00:45:35,830
Well, you know, he threw a football

924
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:39,746
better than anybody in the great
states of Washington or Wisconsin.

925
00:45:39,747 --> 00:45:40,997
But?

926
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,122
How do you know there's a "but"?

927
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:45,247
Because you're an
unoriginal bastard, Ralph.

928
00:45:45,248 --> 00:45:47,496
So, go on. But...

929
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:50,622
But during his final
year at Wisconsin,

930
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:54,746
he had a big dinner for his 21st
birthday at some restaurant.

931
00:45:54,747 --> 00:45:58,122
Locals find out who the dinner's
for, and they start filin' in.

932
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,080
Things get outta control.

933
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:02,038
Manager called the
cops when somebody

934
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,496
broke in his office
and stole some money.

935
00:46:04,497 --> 00:46:06,580
Of course, none of
this is Bo's fault.

936
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:08,330
'Course.

937
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:09,830
But...

938
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:14,496
But the cops came and they took
everybody's name regardless.

939
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:18,122
It was a few hundred people.
Standard operating procedure.

940
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:19,622
But...

941
00:46:21,497 --> 00:46:23,580
Ask me who wasn't there.

942
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,580
Who wasn't there, Ralph?

943
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:27,752
Any of his teammates.

944
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:33,172
None of his teammates came to the
poor guy's birthday party, Sonny.

945
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:46,830
Dick Moore.

946
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:49,247
<i>Hey, Coach. Sonny Weaver.

947
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:52,122
You're about to be
a very happy man.

948
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:55,122
Bo Callahan's some
of my finest work.

949
00:46:55,123 --> 00:46:57,080
What can you tell me about him?

950
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,913
I can tell you what I just told
you, he's some of my finest work.

951
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:02,413
Anything else?

952
00:47:02,414 --> 00:47:04,130
You have the tapes.

953
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:06,454
He's the real deal, Sonny.

954
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:09,081
Don't overthink this like
your dad would have.

955
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:11,331
<i>No offense.

956
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:14,122
<i>Look. I love Bo.

957
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,997
My coaches love him.

958
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:18,164
The cheerleaders love him.
The fans love him.

959
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:20,413
<i>Everyone loves him.

960
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:23,630
Then how come none of his teammates
went to his birthday party?

961
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:27,505
Are you kiddin' me with this?

962
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:29,997
Seems relevant.

963
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:32,413
You want to tear this
kid down, or what?

964
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:34,914
No, I'd just like your take on it.

965
00:47:34,998 --> 00:47:36,913
I find it odd that
nobody on the team

966
00:47:36,914 --> 00:47:39,580
was at their teammate's
21st birthday party.

967
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:43,247
I don't know, Sonny. What do
you think's more plausible?

968
00:47:43,248 --> 00:47:45,580
That nobody on an 85-person squad

969
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:48,456
attended a party
thrown by the captain?

970
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:50,663
Or could it be that when
the cops got to the place

971
00:47:50,664 --> 00:47:53,705
and realized that my boys
had done nothin' wrong,

972
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:56,164
decided not to take down
any of the players' names

973
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,247
because they didn't wanna jam up

974
00:47:57,248 --> 00:47:59,839
a bunch of good kids
for doin' nothin'?

975
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:03,921
<i>Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

976
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,922
Your theory seems right.

977
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,921
Bo Callahan.

978
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:12,506
Bo Callahan hasn't got any friends.

979
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:15,081
Good luck with the Draft today.

980
00:48:15,998 --> 00:48:18,623
C'mon, you guys. You're
lookin' pathetic.

981
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:55,413
Hey, Max.

982
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:57,914
Hey, Sonny. Hope you're holdin' up.

983
00:48:58,123 --> 00:49:00,338
I got an offer for number one.

984
00:49:00,455 --> 00:49:03,421
Yeah? Well, I'm all ears.
What do you have in mind?

985
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:05,164
Okay, here's what we got.

986
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:07,913
Maurice Castillo, Antonio Taylor,

987
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:10,997
our first-rounder next year
and the year after that.

988
00:49:10,998 --> 00:49:13,454
<i>That's two number ones,
a blue-chip running back...

989
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:15,080
I know who they are, Max.

990
00:49:15,081 --> 00:49:17,501
Then you know it's a fair offer.

991
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:22,622
I'm intrigued.

992
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,421
Good. Let's make a deal.

993
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,413
- Well, you gotta give me some time.
- Time?

994
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:32,122
Sonny, time's one thing
neither one of us have.

995
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:33,329
Make the deal.

996
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,921
Give me an hour.

997
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:37,672
We'll give you half that.

998
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:45,621
What's up?

999
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:47,830
I just got off the
phone with Max Stone.

1000
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:50,246
Yeah? How are things in Buffalo?

1001
00:49:50,247 --> 00:49:51,746
Well, I guess you
didn't ask him then,

1002
00:49:51,747 --> 00:49:53,872
when you called him behind my back.

1003
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,496
Max is an old friend of mine.

1004
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:58,122
He calls me up to congratulate
us on the Callahan thing

1005
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:00,288
and I express my
opinions on the matter.

1006
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,585
He call you, or you call him?

1007
00:50:02,747 --> 00:50:05,080
It's such a crazy day.
Who remembers?

1008
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:06,538
Yeah, well, how 'bout
try and remember this,

1009
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:09,164
I can and I will fire your ass.

1010
00:50:09,165 --> 00:50:10,664
Then do it, Sonny.

1011
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:16,746
You actually think
I'm gonna give up

1012
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,788
Bo Callahan for
Taylor and Castillo?

1013
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:20,830
Hmm? Maurice Castillo?

1014
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:22,329
And draft picks, okay?

1015
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,413
Don't forget the
draft picks, Sonny.

1016
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:25,710
You do remember what
those are, right?

1017
00:50:27,789 --> 00:50:30,164
All right. Look. It's...

1018
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:32,246
On the surface, it's not
a terrible trade, but

1019
00:50:32,247 --> 00:50:34,413
why do you think we
need to do this now?

1020
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:36,746
Because you burned up any currency
this team had this morning.

1021
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:38,621
Now you have the opportunity
to build it back up.

1022
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,246
And I don't know what your
problem is with Maurice.

1023
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:41,621
He's a beast.

1024
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,454
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

1025
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:45,413
Your opinion. He
plays in my system.

1026
00:50:45,414 --> 00:50:46,454
He doesn't block!

1027
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,413
I don't need him to block.
I need him to run.

1028
00:50:48,414 --> 00:50:50,329
Which he does, like
a bat outta hell.

1029
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,080
Which takes the pressure
off my offense, okay?

1030
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:57,672
I got 52 Tarzans in that locker
room. I could use a Jane.

1031
00:51:01,497 --> 00:51:04,998
You should at least seriously
consider what I'm saying.

1032
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,621
All right. Get me the
numbers on all their guys.

1033
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,413
We got about 25 minutes
to see what's what.

1034
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:14,880
Great.

1035
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:27,538
Mr. Molina. How are you?

1036
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:31,663
Very good.

1037
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:34,129
Excellent. That's good.
Good to see you.

1038
00:51:34,455 --> 00:51:36,250
I'll take you inside.

1039
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,455
Right up here.

1040
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:44,329
Sonny call you yet?

1041
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,746
Oh, not yet.

1042
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:46,788
What's he doing?

1043
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:48,496
Well, I'm sure he's
gonna call soon.

1044
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:51,246
These are our team reps.
This is Wyndham. This is Phil.

1045
00:51:51,247 --> 00:51:53,080
- Mr. Anthony Molina.
- How do you do?

1046
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,913
- Sir.
- How do you do?

1047
00:51:54,914 --> 00:51:56,080
Right up here.

1048
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:57,163
I'm not sitting here.

1049
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:58,246
Oh, no, of course you're not.

1050
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,163
You're with the Commissioner,
up in his lounge.

1051
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,255
Here, let me show you the way.
Let's go around here.

1052
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,254
He's even better.

1053
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:09,752
Mr. Commissioner?

1054
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:11,288
Hey, Anthony. How are you doing?

1055
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:13,454
What are you doing in my lounge?

1056
00:52:13,455 --> 00:52:16,163
You guys sure made tonight
a lot more exciting.

1057
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:17,288
Thanks for inviting me in.

1058
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:18,496
Enjoy it. Good luck.

1059
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:20,121
- Will do.
- Okay.

1060
00:52:20,122 --> 00:52:22,413
Can we talk football?

1061
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:24,246
Just football, for 30 seconds?

1062
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:25,998
We can always talk football.

1063
00:52:28,497 --> 00:52:30,746
There's a deal on the
table from Buffalo.

1064
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,497
I heard.

1065
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:35,079
What's the war room think?

1066
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,705
Split.

1067
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:38,663
Penn wants me to do it.

1068
00:52:38,664 --> 00:52:40,414
But you don't?

1069
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:41,580
I don't.

1070
00:52:41,581 --> 00:52:42,746
Why?

1071
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,371
Because I know, in
my heart and my gut,

1072
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:45,913
that if I make this
trade with Buffalo,

1073
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:49,413
then I don't get to
make a pick this year.

1074
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:52,079
All I get back are
future draft picks

1075
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,501
for the guy that Molina
brings in to replace me.

1076
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,501
I've been here two years, Ali.

1077
00:53:03,164 --> 00:53:05,084
Two years.

1078
00:53:05,622 --> 00:53:08,288
I've never gotten a chance to

1079
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:11,414
see what a team I put
together can do out there.

1080
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:15,630
First year, it's my dad's team.

1081
00:53:15,998 --> 00:53:19,246
Last year, Drew goes down
before I can see what we had.

1082
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:21,622
Then I get stuck with Penn,

1083
00:53:22,414 --> 00:53:25,915
who I'm still trying to
figure out how to work with.

1084
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:29,418
This is finally supposed
to be my season.

1085
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:34,752
I just want the team
that I want. One time.

1086
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:38,038
So why are you bugging
me if you already know?

1087
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:41,918
I don't know.

1088
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:48,838
I'm makin' mistakes.

1089
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,663
Remember the '89 Super Bowl?

1090
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,914
49ers-Bengals.

1091
00:53:58,497 --> 00:54:01,621
Niners down by three,
3:20 left in the game.

1092
00:54:01,622 --> 00:54:05,746
93-yard winning drive, Taylor beats
the weak safety for a 10-yard TD.

1093
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:08,838
Yeah, but before the drive.

1094
00:54:09,956 --> 00:54:13,246
Joe Montana's in the huddle. Right?

1095
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,204
<i>And unbelievably, somehow spots

1096
00:54:15,205 --> 00:54:17,246
<i>the actor John Candy in the stands.

1097
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:20,246
He points at him and asks
the guys in the huddle,

1098
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:23,748
"Hey, isn't that John Candy?"

1099
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:28,079
They couldn't believe
the balls on him.

1100
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,501
To be that calm, in that
game, at that moment.

1101
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:36,418
His guys instantly
relax, they march...

1102
00:54:36,581 --> 00:54:38,413
93 yards.

1103
00:54:38,414 --> 00:54:40,830
93 yards.

1104
00:54:40,831 --> 00:54:43,251
<i>Montana throws a little
slant to Taylor.

1105
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:46,838
<i>49ers win the Super Bowl.

1106
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:48,580
Great game.

1107
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:50,797
It was a great game.

1108
00:54:57,497 --> 00:55:00,417
No one can stop a ticking clock.

1109
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:02,838
But the great ones,

1110
00:55:03,414 --> 00:55:06,585
the great ones always find
a way to slow it down.

1111
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:10,414
So slow it down, Sonny.

1112
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:16,588
Okay. I made a decision.

1113
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:20,830
It's still Callahan. Let's
inform Buffalo that it's a no.

1114
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,581
That is beautiful.

1115
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:24,246
Okay, Sonny. We're with you.

1116
00:55:24,247 --> 00:55:25,580
Like hell we are.

1117
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:28,413
All due respect, Sonny,
that is a bonehead move.

1118
00:55:28,414 --> 00:55:30,912
Maybe so, but we're
back on Callahan.

1119
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:33,912
Do me a favor. Let's put up the
Wisconsin-Ohio State footage.

1120
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,079
Yeah, sure thing, Sonny.

1121
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,954
We've seen that footage,
like, two million times.

1122
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:39,371
What are you hopin' to find in
it that we haven't seen already?

1123
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:40,705
I'm just double-checking something.

1124
00:55:40,706 --> 00:55:41,746
All right. Here we go.

1125
00:55:41,747 --> 00:55:45,292
All right, roll it down to the
first time Vontae sacks Bo.

1126
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:47,463
All right. Here we go.

1127
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,621
Damn. He shook off two blockers
like they were rag dolls.

1128
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:54,079
And then Bo walks into a bear hug.

1129
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,454
Vontae wrapped him up pretty good.

1130
00:55:55,455 --> 00:55:56,996
Yeah, Bo's hard to sack.

1131
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:59,793
He was one of the least-sacked
QBs in Division I last year.

1132
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:01,496
Go to the next play.

1133
00:56:01,497 --> 00:56:02,912
The next sack?

1134
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:05,664
No. The next play after this one.

1135
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,163
What's he doing?

1136
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:15,663
He got flustered. Didn't wait
for the play to develop.

1137
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,246
Not Bo's finest moment.

1138
00:56:17,247 --> 00:56:19,996
No. Whatever, it's one play.

1139
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:22,497
Take us down to Vontae's next sack.

1140
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:26,955
Ooh!

1141
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:28,663
Oh, man, that is sick!

1142
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:32,079
He absolutely bull-rushed that right
tackle. Bo didn't even have a chance.

1143
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,421
Yeah, I gotta give it to the kid.
He's got a wicked first step.

1144
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:38,004
- See what he does on the next play.
- All right.

1145
00:56:42,205 --> 00:56:44,121
Speed kills. Look at that.

1146
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:45,912
Yeah, look at that.
He gets frantic.

1147
00:56:45,913 --> 00:56:47,621
My favorite thing about rookie QBs.

1148
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:50,163
They get frantic when they
think they're gonna get hit.

1149
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:51,246
Although I gotta give him credit.

1150
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:52,788
Barrio' those two plays,
he was brilliant.

1151
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,664
He threw four TDs, including
the last one to win it.

1152
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,204
Take us down to that.

1153
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:00,705
Yeah.

1154
00:57:04,372 --> 00:57:07,997
Looking downfield, staying calm.

1155
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:10,663
Sonny, this guy's textbook.

1156
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:14,204
Man, this kid is strong.
That's impressive.

1157
00:57:14,205 --> 00:57:18,547
That's pure Roethlisberger.
He's pro-ready. End of story.

1158
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:20,413
Take it back.

1159
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:24,373
Rewind that back to the
start of the play.

1160
00:57:24,706 --> 00:57:26,581
Just stop right here.

1161
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:27,912
What's missing?

1162
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:29,037
Fullback.

1163
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:30,538
But Wisconsin runs most of their

1164
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:32,246
passing plays out of
an empty backfield.

1165
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:34,588
No, not what I'm
lookin' at. Try again.

1166
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:39,372
Where's Vontae?

1167
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:44,496
You know what, Sonny?
I think he got ejected.

1168
00:57:44,497 --> 00:57:46,413
- He got ejected from the game?
- Yeah.

1169
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:47,496
For what?

1170
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,329
Yeah, in the third
quarter, after he stripped

1171
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:51,246
the ball from Callahan
and scored that TD.

1172
00:57:51,247 --> 00:57:52,746
He gave the ball to a fan.

1173
00:57:52,747 --> 00:57:54,580
When he got flagged
for it, he went nuts,

1174
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:56,371
touched the refs. So
they threw him out.

1175
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,204
Bonehead move.

1176
00:57:58,205 --> 00:57:59,875
Let's see that.

1177
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:26,663
This is college. What's
he thinkin', you know?

1178
00:58:28,913 --> 00:58:30,913
See? That's it.

1179
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,204
There you go.

1180
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:34,663
He was showing off. You
can't do that in college.

1181
00:58:34,664 --> 00:58:36,959
You can't hand the
ball to some girl.

1182
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:41,037
That's not some girl.

1183
00:58:41,038 --> 00:58:43,584
That's not some girl, guys.
That's his sister.

1184
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:49,414
She died about six months later.

1185
00:58:50,414 --> 00:58:53,414
Boo-friggin'-hoo.

1186
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:55,704
We ain't runnin' an
after-school special here.

1187
00:58:55,705 --> 00:58:57,454
We're runnin' a football team,

1188
00:58:57,455 --> 00:59:00,871
whose offense was ranked 28th
in the league last year.

1189
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:03,043
And I still need a runnin' back.

1190
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:28,580
What can I say, Rich?

1191
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:31,413
I love being here,
I love feeling the energy,

1192
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:33,912
and I love having the
number one pick.

1193
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,496
I hope that you would
love having it,

1194
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:37,580
because you sure gave
up a ton to get it.

1195
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:39,704
For the record,
I didn't do anything.

1196
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,580
And "ton" is a relative word.

1197
00:59:41,581 --> 00:59:42,662
Playing coy. I like it.

1198
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,912
Come on, just between two
guys, forget the cameras,

1199
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:46,704
who're you gonna take,
number one overall?

1200
00:59:46,705 --> 00:59:50,704
Well, I think it would be
unsportsmanlike, spoil the surprise.

1201
00:59:50,705 --> 00:59:54,046
Anthony Molina. Not
giving me anything.

1202
00:59:58,164 --> 00:59:59,329
What?

1203
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,413
Just please come with me.

1204
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:03,005
What? Oh, no, not back in there.

1205
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:15,209
So?

1206
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,876
So, what do you want?

1207
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:24,254
Honestly...

1208
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:32,080
I don't want to be a secret.

1209
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,754
Okay.

1210
01:00:39,872 --> 01:00:41,454
Let's not be a secret.

1211
01:00:45,414 --> 01:00:47,209
Excuse me.

1212
01:00:48,663 --> 01:00:50,496
- Jesus, Rick!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1213
01:00:50,497 --> 01:00:52,496
The head of security said he
wanted to talk to Mr. Weaver.

1214
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:54,497
He said it was urgent.

1215
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,745
- Ralph.
- Sonny.

1216
01:00:56,746 --> 01:00:58,204
- Ali.
- Ralph.

1217
01:00:58,205 --> 01:00:59,829
Everybody cozy?

1218
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:02,413
Good.

1219
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:06,584
Sonny, if you don't mind, I've got
something for you in my office.

1220
01:01:12,455 --> 01:01:14,413
Got a new Callahan story for you.

1221
01:01:14,414 --> 01:01:16,246
Not sure I want to hear it.

1222
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,912
You know, you hung me out to dry
pretty good with the last one.

1223
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:20,829
Just talked to Jack
Tate in Washington.

1224
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:23,246
He said when they found out
they had the number five pick,

1225
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,163
first thing they did was send
a copy of their playbook

1226
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,996
to all the guys they
were interested in.

1227
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:28,579
Right. We do the same thing.

1228
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,079
No, no, they put a little
special twist on it.

1229
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,579
They tape a $100 bill
to the last page.

1230
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,745
Why?

1231
01:01:34,746 --> 01:01:36,413
So when they're
interviewin' the guys

1232
01:01:36,414 --> 01:01:38,537
and they ask 'em if they'd
read the whole playbook,

1233
01:01:38,538 --> 01:01:40,704
of course all of 'em
are gonna say yes.

1234
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:44,246
'Bout half of 'em, they mention the
money. But the other half don't.

1235
01:01:44,247 --> 01:01:46,288
So, when they tell 'em
about the $100 bill,

1236
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:47,579
most of the guys get embarrassed.

1237
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,912
They get flustered.
They fess up that

1238
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,871
they didn't read the whole thing.

1239
01:01:50,872 --> 01:01:53,413
But ask me what your
boy Bo Callahan did.

1240
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:55,413
You know, I really hate
playing this game with you.

1241
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:57,079
Ask.

1242
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,750
All right. What did Bo Callahan do?

1243
01:02:00,872 --> 01:02:02,587
Neither.

1244
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,705
He said that he'd read it, and
then he didn't say anything.

1245
01:02:07,414 --> 01:02:08,913
So?

1246
01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:12,246
He didn't know about the
$100 bill, Sonny. He lied.

1247
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:13,787
He never read the whole playbook.

1248
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:15,079
So? A lot of guys don't.

1249
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,829
Yes. But when they
confront him about it

1250
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:19,413
and they tell him about
the money, he lied again.

1251
01:02:19,414 --> 01:02:20,537
He said something like,

1252
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:23,754
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
Good one. Good one, guys."

1253
01:02:23,913 --> 01:02:26,579
Jack said he is the only
guy to tell the lie

1254
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,081
and then to have the balls to
stand and stick up for the lie.

1255
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,620
Said it was the second
strangest response

1256
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:37,042
he had seen to the $100 bill thing.

1257
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,121
Wanna know what the first was?

1258
01:02:41,122 --> 01:02:43,579
God damn it, Ralph. Just tell me.

1259
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,671
A kid mailed the $100
bill back to them.

1260
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:50,163
That kid put it in a card,
and he wrote on the card,

1261
01:02:50,164 --> 01:02:53,246
"Save this for when I win
you the Super Bowl."

1262
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,871
Nice.

1263
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:56,329
Don't you wanna know
who that kid was?

1264
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:58,205
No!

1265
01:02:58,913 --> 01:03:01,334
It was Brian Drew.

1266
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:07,084
It was Brian Drew.

1267
01:03:30,872 --> 01:03:32,371
Hey, Zotti.

1268
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:34,163
Texans thinkin' of makin' a move?

1269
01:03:34,164 --> 01:03:36,579
Talk to me about Vontae Mack.

1270
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,079
<i>Why? What do you wanna know?

1271
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,579
Who cares why?

1272
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,745
But you...

1273
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:43,745
You're thinkin' of
pickin' him at 15?

1274
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:45,871
He's got potential, no?

1275
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:48,588
Friend-to-friend, what
else do I need to know?

1276
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,079
Well, he's a great kid.

1277
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,163
Come on!

1278
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,912
That's what I know!

1279
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:56,662
Quit playing games.

1280
01:03:56,663 --> 01:03:59,579
You didn't think he was gonna fall
in the second round, did you?

1281
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,871
Somebody's gonna pick him, Sonny.

1282
01:04:00,872 --> 01:04:02,747
Tell me why that shouldn't be me.

1283
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:05,667
I'd never tell you
how to do your job.

1284
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:07,704
You find something with him?

1285
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:10,251
I didn't say that.

1286
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,125
You didn't not say that.

1287
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:15,837
Good luck tonight.

1288
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:24,834
Stop runnin'!

1289
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,745
Any news?

1290
01:04:28,746 --> 01:04:31,704
We just got off the phone
with Houston. They're at 15.

1291
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:34,421
With the Cleveland thing,
that might be your best shot.

1292
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:36,329
Fifteen?

1293
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:39,246
And I'm not 100% sure about that.

1294
01:04:39,247 --> 01:04:41,163
What does that mean, man?

1295
01:04:41,164 --> 01:04:43,412
It means it could be a long night.

1296
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:46,754
But stay positive. You never
know with these things.

1297
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,829
What's all this?

1298
01:04:54,913 --> 01:04:56,954
Both of you? Really?

1299
01:04:58,205 --> 01:05:00,080
Did you have a fire? Or...

1300
01:05:00,413 --> 01:05:04,164
I do not need this today.
I really don't.

1301
01:05:04,205 --> 01:05:05,704
You look terrible.

1302
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:06,745
Thank you.

1303
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:08,246
You really do.

1304
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:10,088
Thank you, too.

1305
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:14,046
We had the reading
of your dad's will.

1306
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:19,664
Would you believe, he wants his
ashes scattered on his field.

1307
01:05:19,705 --> 01:05:21,921
The practice field? Here?

1308
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,079
Weaver Field. Yes.

1309
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,037
And I'd like to do it
as soon as possible.

1310
01:05:28,038 --> 01:05:29,871
You can't be serious.

1311
01:05:29,872 --> 01:05:31,370
Why? I'm not gonna bother anyone.

1312
01:05:31,371 --> 01:05:34,246
I just wanna do it exactly
as he asked for it.

1313
01:05:34,247 --> 01:05:38,918
And he wants you to read
this while we're scattering.

1314
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,079
It's a Gaelic blessing.

1315
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,375
Now? You're saying you
want to do all this now?

1316
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,079
All we have to do is walk out
on the 50-yard line with you...

1317
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,495
- You read the...
- With me?

1318
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:49,912
It's what he wanted.

1319
01:05:49,913 --> 01:05:51,912
How the hell would you
know what he wanted?

1320
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:53,079
Please don't shout.

1321
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,579
Because I was at the will
reading. Unlike you.

1322
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,246
Isn't there an art
exhibition in New York

1323
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,996
that you have to be
at or something?

1324
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,912
This isn't going to
be a long affair.

1325
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:03,328
We just go out there, read the
prayer, dump the ashes, and go home.

1326
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,412
No!

1327
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:06,038
Is everything okay?

1328
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,921
Everything's fine.

1329
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:13,670
Ali, this is my ex-wife, Angie.

1330
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:16,754
- Hello.
- Hi.

1331
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,246
Hi, Barb.

1332
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:19,871
How you doin', Amy?

1333
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,250
"Ali." You know it's Ali.

1334
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:26,750
She's the...

1335
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,079
Oh, her. Oh.

1336
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,412
Yeah. That's me.

1337
01:06:30,413 --> 01:06:32,245
Get us some coffee,
will you, sweetie?

1338
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:33,912
Mom, that's not her job.

1339
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,829
- It's okay. I can get 'em coffee.
- I'll have a green tea.

1340
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,370
No, stay. Just, please, stay.

1341
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:38,579
I'd like to have a coffee, Sonny.

1342
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,745
No. No. No coffee, Mom.

1343
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,079
You want to spread these goddamn
ashes, you do it tomorrow!

1344
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,579
- No.
- I'm serious!

1345
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,250
No!

1346
01:06:49,913 --> 01:06:53,245
Now then, are you going to read this
prayer as your father asked you to?

1347
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:55,542
No, I'm not!

1348
01:06:58,038 --> 01:07:00,038
Not today.

1349
01:07:00,997 --> 01:07:02,587
Fine.

1350
01:07:04,038 --> 01:07:06,412
I will do it myself.

1351
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:10,413
Good luck.

1352
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,204
How about some fresh air?

1353
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,079
Whoever thought it meant
that much to him?

1354
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,330
Naming a simple practice
field in his honor.

1355
01:07:30,038 --> 01:07:33,754
God, he took pride in
the weirdest things.

1356
01:07:34,913 --> 01:07:37,583
He was your father, Sonny.

1357
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:43,587
What was it? Why did
you hate him so much?

1358
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:47,170
I didn't hate my father.

1359
01:07:49,705 --> 01:07:53,579
You know what, everyone always gives
me grief for firing my father.

1360
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,376
Well, you did. I was here that day.

1361
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,254
It was my mother.

1362
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:03,245
What?

1363
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,912
It was my mother.

1364
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:07,079
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm the one who fired him.

1365
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,830
But it was my mother
who asked me to do it.

1366
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:17,871
My dad's doctors told
him that the stress

1367
01:08:17,872 --> 01:08:20,328
of coaching was gonna
kill him, so...

1368
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,745
Of course, he refused to retire.

1369
01:08:22,746 --> 01:08:25,203
So, now I have a choice.

1370
01:08:25,204 --> 01:08:28,329
The time he has left at
home with my mother,

1371
01:08:28,663 --> 01:08:32,245
or another year on the sidelines,

1372
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:37,338
where maybe he drops dead
on national television.

1373
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:41,913
So what do you do?

1374
01:08:42,413 --> 01:08:45,084
I gave it to my mom
and I fired him.

1375
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,913
How come you never
told me that before?

1376
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,579
You know, there's already so
many versions of what happened

1377
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,412
that it's not really somethin'
I love talking about.

1378
01:08:53,413 --> 01:08:55,037
You never told him?

1379
01:08:55,038 --> 01:08:57,745
You let him believe that his
only son would just fire him?

1380
01:08:57,746 --> 01:08:59,079
That's how we do
things in my family.

1381
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,750
Sonny.

1382
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,751
And all I ever wanted to do
was just get him a ring.

1383
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,751
Oh, jeez...

1384
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:16,663
What is this?

1385
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:21,996
They wanna pay their respects.

1386
01:09:36,913 --> 01:09:38,583
Rick, what are you doing?

1387
01:09:41,997 --> 01:09:44,417
Someone broke my computer.

1388
01:09:46,204 --> 01:09:50,250
Can you believe that? I mean, this
thing had my entire life on it, and...

1389
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:53,421
I don't know. Who would do that?

1390
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:56,086
It was me.

1391
01:09:57,079 --> 01:09:59,000
I threw it against the wall.

1392
01:09:59,413 --> 01:10:01,913
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1393
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,412
Why would you do that?

1394
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,413
Look, I lost my head, okay?

1395
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,871
I've been steppin'
on my dick all day.

1396
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:12,417
Look, we'll get you a new one,
all right? We'll get you a better one.

1397
01:10:13,913 --> 01:10:17,083
One with all the
bells and whistles.

1398
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,376
Look. You've been a soldier today,
all right? You don't deserve this.

1399
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,079
Okay?

1400
01:10:24,329 --> 01:10:26,079
- Yeah.
- Good.

1401
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:49,579
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the red carpet,

1402
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:55,078
from the University of Wisconsin,
2014 Heisman Trophy winner,

1403
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:57,078
quarterback Bo Callahan!

1404
01:11:01,413 --> 01:11:04,036
from Florida State University,

1405
01:11:04,037 --> 01:11:06,871
running back Ray Jennings.

1406
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,914
How're you doin'?

1407
01:11:21,913 --> 01:11:25,036
Ray, remind me when they
picked you. Was it first? Second?

1408
01:11:25,037 --> 01:11:26,245
Mmm.

1409
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:29,292
It still hurts. 26th.

1410
01:11:29,413 --> 01:11:31,333
Well, that's good, too.

1411
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:33,913
That's my number one
guy right there.

1412
01:11:34,746 --> 01:11:36,245
Ready?

1413
01:11:45,246 --> 01:11:46,829
You got this.

1414
01:11:52,246 --> 01:11:54,496
Sonny, my man!

1415
01:11:55,163 --> 01:11:57,789
Oh, I am excited to
hear your voice.

1416
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,495
We were wonderin' when you were
gonna call us with that good news.

1417
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:01,995
<i>Wanna talk to Bo, Chris.

1418
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:04,087
Here's the man you wanna speak to.

1419
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:06,500
It's the Browns.

1420
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:11,996
This is Bo.

1421
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,537
Hey, Bo. How you doin'?

1422
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,078
<i>Well, I'm good, Mr. Weaver. Excited
to be a part of the NFL, you know.

1423
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,250
Good, that's great, Bo.
Thrilled to hear that.

1424
01:12:20,705 --> 01:12:22,995
Listen, I'm gonna ask you something

1425
01:12:22,996 --> 01:12:25,745
and I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

1426
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:27,287
You think you can do that?

1427
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:29,083
Yes, sure. Anything, Mr. Weaver.

1428
01:12:30,872 --> 01:12:34,372
Bo, did your teammates come
to your birthday party?

1429
01:12:34,705 --> 01:12:36,250
What?

1430
01:12:38,538 --> 01:12:41,162
For your 21st birthday party,

1431
01:12:41,163 --> 01:12:47,084
I'm asking, did your teammates at
Wisconsin come to that party or not?

1432
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:51,245
Look, Mr. Weaver,
this isn't somethin'

1433
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:54,417
I'm really very proud
of, sir, but...

1434
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,995
I don't really remember a single
thing from that night, sir.

1435
01:13:03,204 --> 01:13:05,249
You know what?

1436
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,500
I don't remember mine either.

1437
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:13,750
Thanks, Bo. Talk to you later.

1438
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:18,750
What'd he say?

1439
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:22,830
Nothin'.

1440
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,204
Hey.

1441
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,375
You okay?

1442
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:10,371
Do I take Callahan?

1443
01:14:11,996 --> 01:14:14,542
What do you want me to say?

1444
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,746
He's a winner.

1445
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:20,546
He is.

1446
01:14:21,204 --> 01:14:24,495
He is. I mean, that's the word, right?
He's won everywhere he's been.

1447
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:26,120
I get that.

1448
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:30,036
But they said the same
thing about Ryan Leaf

1449
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:32,412
when he was the number
two pick in '98.

1450
01:14:32,413 --> 01:14:36,083
No one said that about Tom
Brady when he went 199th.

1451
01:14:37,496 --> 01:14:40,246
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

1452
01:14:41,746 --> 01:14:47,791
At the end of the day, all that
matters is what you think.

1453
01:15:02,413 --> 01:15:04,787
Vontae! Vontae!

1454
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:12,162
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

1455
01:15:12,163 --> 01:15:15,879
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

1456
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:38,245
Oh, dude, that's, like,
your fifth piece of pizza.

1457
01:15:38,246 --> 01:15:40,828
I eat when I'm nervous. Don't
make me feel bad about it.

1458
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:42,744
Yeah, I get like that, too.

1459
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:45,371
Hey, guys. It's gettin' late.

1460
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:51,620
<i>History in the making here
today at the NFL Draft.

1461
01:15:51,621 --> 01:15:54,120
<i>Already fascinating
twists and turns

1462
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:56,662
<i>as the Seattle Seahawks
and the Cleveland Browns

1463
01:15:56,663 --> 01:16:01,879
<i>have engaged in a historic trade
just hours before this moment.

1464
01:16:11,329 --> 01:16:13,579
Here's the Commissioner.

1465
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:30,539
Welcome to primetime and
the 2014 NFL Draft.

1466
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:34,163
This is an exciting
night for our players,

1467
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:35,919
our teams,

1468
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:37,953
and for you, the fans.

1469
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:45,746
The season begins tonight,
so let's kick it off.

1470
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:50,830
The 2014 NFL Draft
is officially open.

1471
01:16:54,496 --> 01:16:58,371
After an earlier trade with
the Seattle Seahawks today,

1472
01:16:58,454 --> 01:17:01,329
the Cleveland Browns
are now on the clock.

1473
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:06,579
Where the hell is Sonny, guys?
We're on the clock here.

1474
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,911
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Should be here.

1475
01:17:08,912 --> 01:17:10,661
<i>Okay. So the Browns
now have 10 minutes

1476
01:17:10,662 --> 01:17:12,453
<i>on the clock to make a choice.

1477
01:17:12,454 --> 01:17:14,619
<i>And if they don't do
that in that time,

1478
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:17,162
the team picking behind
them can then jump up

1479
01:17:17,163 --> 01:17:20,287
and potentially steal away the
player the Browns wanted.

1480
01:17:20,288 --> 01:17:24,078
It's a situation we saw play out in
2003 with the Minnesota Vikings

1481
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,125
<i>and it happened again in 2011
with the Baltimore Ravens.

1482
01:17:36,662 --> 01:17:38,120
Sonny!

1483
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:41,871
Yeah, thank God! Yeah, I was
wondering what you were doing.

1484
01:17:42,496 --> 01:17:44,744
Yeah. It's go time, boss.

1485
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:48,462
Yeah, yeah. What name do you
want the Commissioner to say?

1486
01:17:50,829 --> 01:17:52,329
All right.

1487
01:18:02,996 --> 01:18:04,619
Hey, guys, he's here.

1488
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,911
Sonny, thank God. Where you
been? We're on the clock!

1489
01:18:06,912 --> 01:18:08,744
Sonny, when are we
sendin' in the ticket?

1490
01:18:08,745 --> 01:18:10,245
Yeah.

1491
01:18:10,413 --> 01:18:12,287
I already sent the ticket.

1492
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:13,744
You did what?

1493
01:18:13,745 --> 01:18:15,578
You sent the ticket?

1494
01:18:15,579 --> 01:18:16,911
It's tradition! We all send it!

1495
01:18:16,912 --> 01:18:18,661
New tradition, guys, all right?

1496
01:18:18,662 --> 01:18:22,753
When this team starts winning,
we'll go back to that.

1497
01:18:30,704 --> 01:18:32,828
And the pick is finally in.

1498
01:18:32,829 --> 01:18:33,995
It's currently being brandished

1499
01:18:33,996 --> 01:18:36,162
by some walkie-talkied individual

1500
01:18:36,163 --> 01:18:38,254
taking it up to the
Commissioner's podium.

1501
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:42,292
<i>A big, humongous pick for
the Cleveland Browns.

1502
01:18:43,329 --> 01:18:45,828
<i>Now, to find out whose
name is on that card,

1503
01:18:45,912 --> 01:18:49,744
<i>here's the Commissioner ready
to make history in Cleveland.

1504
01:18:58,579 --> 01:19:02,875
With the first pick of
the 2014 NFL Draft,

1505
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:07,245
the Cleveland Browns select.

1506
01:19:08,662 --> 01:19:12,870
<i>Vontae Mack, linebacker,
Ohio State.

1507
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:25,412
Yes! Yes!

1508
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:32,703
These things happen.

1509
01:19:36,912 --> 01:19:39,412
That's what you decided to do?

1510
01:19:45,454 --> 01:19:47,995
An absolute stunner here
at Radio City Music Hall.

1511
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,203
The Cleveland Browns, with
the number one overall pick,

1512
01:19:50,204 --> 01:19:52,494
take Vontae Mack!

1513
01:19:52,495 --> 01:19:54,578
<i>Unbelievable to me
that Sonny Weaver Jr.

1514
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:56,703
<i>would make a deal of this magnitude

1515
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,245
<i>and come away with this.

1516
01:19:58,246 --> 01:19:59,911
Forget about Vontae
Mack for a second.

1517
01:19:59,912 --> 01:20:01,578
They could have had Bo Callahan.

1518
01:20:01,579 --> 01:20:04,078
He's the surefire slam-dunk
number one pick.

1519
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:05,661
We all knew it comin' in here.

1520
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:08,578
If I'm Brian Drew, current
quarterback of the Cleveland Browns,

1521
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:09,953
I better play good.

1522
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:43,287
Yeah. No, no. I realize that.

1523
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:45,162
He wants to talk to him right now.

1524
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:46,411
Then call me back.

1525
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:47,452
I'm sorry, sir...

1526
01:20:47,453 --> 01:20:48,870
Just get in the damn car.

1527
01:20:48,871 --> 01:20:50,370
This is Anthony.

1528
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:52,203
Tell Sonny I'm on
my way to Teterboro

1529
01:20:52,204 --> 01:20:56,795
and I will literally be in his face in
an hour and he will talk to me then.

1530
01:20:56,912 --> 01:20:58,787
I will, sir.

1531
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:01,578
- Safe trip, sir.
- Thank you, Marvin.

1532
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,624
It's Sonny.

1533
01:21:21,495 --> 01:21:23,578
Sonny Weaver Jr.

1534
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:26,955
Congratulations, Vontae.
You're a Cleveland Brown.

1535
01:21:27,453 --> 01:21:30,329
I'm a Cleveland Brown!

1536
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,411
Car's gonna be picking
you up in 10 minutes,

1537
01:21:32,412 --> 01:21:34,078
and we're flying you to Cleveland.

1538
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,794
You think you can manage that?

1539
01:21:35,912 --> 01:21:39,253
Oh...

1540
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:46,874
You need to get back inside.

1541
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:49,036
What just happened?

1542
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,502
This is the NFL Draft.

1543
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,753
These things happen all the time.

1544
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:56,870
Now trust me.

1545
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:59,911
These teams, they don't want
a quarterback that panics.

1546
01:21:59,912 --> 01:22:02,787
I need you to come inside, now.

1547
01:22:08,495 --> 01:22:10,041
Come on.

1548
01:22:20,453 --> 01:22:23,419
You picked Vontae. Wow.

1549
01:22:24,829 --> 01:22:28,704
Three first-round picks to get the
guy I could have gotten all along.

1550
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,703
Jesus, I used to think
I was good at this.

1551
01:22:32,704 --> 01:22:34,452
Well, that remains to be seen.

1552
01:22:35,704 --> 01:22:39,329
Sometimes, the correct
path is the tortured one.

1553
01:22:40,579 --> 01:22:42,661
It's a gift, Sonny.

1554
01:22:42,662 --> 01:22:46,287
You see things other people
don't see. It's one of the things...

1555
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:52,121
It's one of the things
I love about you.

1556
01:22:57,662 --> 01:22:59,162
Excuse me.

1557
01:22:59,954 --> 01:23:01,619
You're not gonna believe
what's happening.

1558
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,120
<i>You know, I think back, Deion,

1559
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:07,245
<i>and I go back to 1983 and I start
thinkin' about Dan Marino.

1560
01:23:07,246 --> 01:23:08,911
<i>He was the sixth
quarterback taken...

1561
01:23:08,912 --> 01:23:10,452
Holy shit!

1562
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:11,536
What's goin' on?

1563
01:23:11,537 --> 01:23:13,457
He's dropping.

1564
01:23:13,579 --> 01:23:14,661
What?

1565
01:23:14,662 --> 01:23:16,870
Picks number two and three
are not Bo Callahan.

1566
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:18,666
Nobody's pickin' him.

1567
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,536
<i>Just last year.

1568
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,078
<i>Geno Smith drops out
of the first round,

1569
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,162
<i>and there are all kinds of
rumors goin' on right now,

1570
01:23:27,163 --> 01:23:29,833
<i>"Why is this kid dropping and..."

1571
01:23:30,121 --> 01:23:32,411
Everybody's freaking out, Sonny.

1572
01:23:32,412 --> 01:23:35,503
St. Louis went with Anderson.
Miami took Palmer.

1573
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:38,536
Who's picking fourth?

1574
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:40,083
Arizona.

1575
01:23:40,579 --> 01:23:42,120
Are they gonna take Callahan?

1576
01:23:42,121 --> 01:23:44,494
They should, but everybody's
off their game.

1577
01:23:44,495 --> 01:23:47,078
Rams and the Dolphins, both
went with their expected picks,

1578
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:48,828
even though Bo was still available.

1579
01:23:48,829 --> 01:23:51,369
Everybody's panickin' 'cause
Callahan's still there.

1580
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:55,167
Jesus, what if he drops to seventh?
Seahawks have seventh.

1581
01:23:55,328 --> 01:23:57,203
What if they ended
up with Callahan?

1582
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:59,870
Well, then Tom Michaels
is the GM of the decade.

1583
01:23:59,871 --> 01:24:03,078
I'm goin' to the can, to throw up.

1584
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,828
Okay. Denver has five.
Jacksonville has six.

1585
01:24:06,829 --> 01:24:08,411
Yeah, but Denver's not
gonna take Callahan.

1586
01:24:08,412 --> 01:24:09,911
They got Herrod, he's an All-Pro.

1587
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:13,083
So if Arizona balks, then
Jacksonville's all over him.

1588
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:15,411
Unless they balk, too.

1589
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:18,870
And our friend Tom Michaels
grabs him at seven. Shit!

1590
01:24:18,871 --> 01:24:21,837
They have that kid GM down in
Jacksonville. What is his name?

1591
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:23,911
Jeff Carson.

1592
01:24:23,912 --> 01:24:25,078
Rookie.

1593
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,374
Right, Jeff Carson.

1594
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:53,120
<i>Hey, buddy.

1595
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,536
Holy shit, man. What do you
know? What do you know?

1596
01:24:55,537 --> 01:24:57,128
<i>About what?

1597
01:24:57,328 --> 01:25:00,078
About this! About this thing!
What's wrong with Callahan?

1598
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,244
Nothing. We like Vontae better.

1599
01:25:02,245 --> 01:25:04,744
The Rams took my pick.
Everything's out of whack.

1600
01:25:04,745 --> 01:25:07,290
<i>Well, you still have time.

1601
01:25:08,829 --> 01:25:10,536
Arizona is picking right now.

1602
01:25:10,537 --> 01:25:12,412
You're right. Hold on.

1603
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:17,536
<i>With the fourth pick
of the 2014 NFL Draft,

1604
01:25:17,537 --> 01:25:19,953
<i>the Arizona Cardinals select

1605
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:23,911
<i>Robert Starks, cornerback,
Georgia Tech.

1606
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:30,045
Wow. Arizona went corner.

1607
01:25:30,579 --> 01:25:32,244
Shit. Starks was my backup.

1608
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:35,119
That's a tough break, but,
hey, Callahan's still in play.

1609
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:36,786
Who's pickin' fifth?

1610
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:39,494
The Broncos, and they're
not taking Callahan.

1611
01:25:39,495 --> 01:25:41,786
They got Matt Herrod.
They don't need Callahan.

1612
01:25:41,787 --> 01:25:42,911
Yeah, I think you're right.

1613
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:44,911
I think they're gonna go with
that big kid outta Oregon.

1614
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:47,332
Dearborne. Left tackle.

1615
01:25:47,954 --> 01:25:50,870
Well, congratulations, Jeff.

1616
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:52,911
Looks like you got
yourself Bo Callahan

1617
01:25:52,912 --> 01:25:55,078
to quarterback the
Jacksonville Jaguars.

1618
01:25:55,079 --> 01:25:57,249
You gotta be straight with me.

1619
01:25:57,704 --> 01:25:59,161
About what?

1620
01:25:59,162 --> 01:26:01,995
What's wrong with Callahan?
Why is everyone passin' on him?

1621
01:26:01,996 --> 01:26:03,286
Why did you pass on him?

1622
01:26:03,287 --> 01:26:05,036
I told you. We like Vontae better.

1623
01:26:05,037 --> 01:26:09,286
Damn it, Sonny, I'm about to
be on the clock here. Please.

1624
01:26:09,287 --> 01:26:10,828
What's wrong with Callahan?

1625
01:26:10,829 --> 01:26:12,244
Can I be frank with you?

1626
01:26:12,245 --> 01:26:13,745
Yes.

1627
01:26:15,037 --> 01:26:16,369
I think he's a bust.

1628
01:26:17,537 --> 01:26:18,911
What?

1629
01:26:18,912 --> 01:26:20,202
How? Why?

1630
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:22,920
I don't know. Gut feeling.

1631
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:26,536
To be honest, Jeff, it's a
character thing for me.

1632
01:26:26,537 --> 01:26:27,870
But, look, I have other needs.

1633
01:26:27,871 --> 01:26:30,244
So, if you wanna make
a trade for six,

1634
01:26:30,245 --> 01:26:32,411
I can make that happen right now.

1635
01:26:32,412 --> 01:26:34,703
You want six? Who are you takin'?

1636
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,327
<i>I can't tell you that, Jeff.

1637
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:40,411
The question is, do you
want to make a trade?

1638
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:43,244
Because if you're not
sold on Callahan,

1639
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:45,536
you can still come out of here
with a handful of draft picks,

1640
01:26:45,537 --> 01:26:47,578
you look like a seasoned pro,

1641
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:50,494
<i>and everybody wonders what
you're up to next year.

1642
01:26:50,495 --> 01:26:52,494
I don't know. I don't know, Sonny.

1643
01:26:52,495 --> 01:26:57,541
Look, Jeff, every year someone comes
out of this looking like a donkey.

1644
01:26:57,829 --> 01:26:59,995
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah.

1645
01:26:59,996 --> 01:27:01,578
Good. Because tomorrow
I got a feeling

1646
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,078
it could be you if you
don't make this deal.

1647
01:27:06,996 --> 01:27:09,953
Look, everyone else has a reason

1648
01:27:09,954 --> 01:27:12,795
to pass on Bo Callahan. You don't.

1649
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:15,586
Give me six.

1650
01:27:17,412 --> 01:27:19,619
Give me six and I'll give you
our second-round pick this year

1651
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,703
and our second-rounder next year.

1652
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:23,374
Do what?

1653
01:27:23,954 --> 01:27:27,452
Oh! That sounds awesome,
Sonny. What am I, a jerk?

1654
01:27:27,453 --> 01:27:29,828
I'm just spit-balling here, Jeff.

1655
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:33,411
<i>Two number twos for the
sixth overall? I'm not an idiot.

1656
01:27:33,412 --> 01:27:35,661
I'd give you ones, but
I already dealt 'em.

1657
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:38,119
Well, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

1658
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,661
Jesus, the clock.

1659
01:27:39,662 --> 01:27:41,161
I know. Denver hasn't picked yet,

1660
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:43,537
but they will any
second, all right?

1661
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:46,999
Shit, Sonny, I need more. Tell me.

1662
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:50,586
What is the very best
that you can do?

1663
01:28:01,787 --> 01:28:03,457
Final offer.

1664
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:06,327
Take our number two pick this year,

1665
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:09,119
next year, and the
next year after that.

1666
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,712
That's three years
of number two picks.

1667
01:28:19,245 --> 01:28:23,041
Four. I want your next
four number twos.

1668
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:27,077
Nah, Jeff, I'm not gonna do that.

1669
01:28:27,078 --> 01:28:29,661
Stay with me on planet
Earth here, all right?

1670
01:28:29,662 --> 01:28:32,378
You know what I just
offered you is fair.

1671
01:28:34,162 --> 01:28:37,629
So, three years of second-rounders?

1672
01:28:37,787 --> 01:28:40,536
That's right. For
your pick right now.

1673
01:28:40,537 --> 01:28:42,202
And you and your guys can regroup,

1674
01:28:42,203 --> 01:28:45,749
figure yourselves out and relax.

1675
01:28:49,787 --> 01:28:52,378
This is a good deal, Jeff.

1676
01:28:54,537 --> 01:28:57,583
This is a good deal for both of us.

1677
01:29:04,453 --> 01:29:05,536
Deal.

1678
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,244
Good, Jeff. You did good.

1679
01:29:12,245 --> 01:29:15,086
Call it in. Call it in.

1680
01:29:16,704 --> 01:29:18,419
Hey, this is Marx.

1681
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,120
We got something, Ken.

1682
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:26,286
- Cleveland's in this.
- And Jacksonville.

1683
01:29:26,287 --> 01:29:27,787
Okay, give it to me.

1684
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:31,244
Okay, somebody get me Tom
Michaels on the phone.

1685
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:33,290
Tell me you didn't
just do that, Sonny.

1686
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:36,744
Michaels. Tom Michaels.

1687
01:29:36,745 --> 01:29:37,828
Are we on the clock?

1688
01:29:37,829 --> 01:29:39,744
Tell me you didn't just do that.

1689
01:29:39,745 --> 01:29:40,828
We just got the number six pick.

1690
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:43,452
And, no, we are not on the clock.
Denver's on the clock.

1691
01:29:43,453 --> 01:29:45,744
Okay, so we got six!
Who are we picking at six?

1692
01:29:45,745 --> 01:29:47,411
Rick, can you get Marvin
on the phone now?

1693
01:29:47,412 --> 01:29:48,578
Let me get this straight.

1694
01:29:48,579 --> 01:29:51,578
In the span of one day, you
have managed to burn through

1695
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:54,786
three years' worth of number one and
number two picks, is that correct?

1696
01:29:54,787 --> 01:29:55,869
Yeah.

1697
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:57,786
- I quit, Sonny.
- Don't quit.

1698
01:29:57,787 --> 01:29:59,536
I can't coach a team that
doesn't have a future, Sonny.

1699
01:29:59,537 --> 01:30:00,661
That's the way it works.

1700
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:01,952
I got Tom Michaels on the line!

1701
01:30:01,953 --> 01:30:03,452
Sonny, are we trading six?

1702
01:30:03,453 --> 01:30:05,873
Will everyone please just shut up?

1703
01:30:06,829 --> 01:30:07,910
People, please,

1704
01:30:07,911 --> 01:30:12,162
can I have a moment of goddamn silence
while I do my job here, okay?

1705
01:30:13,911 --> 01:30:16,119
Look. Don't quit, all right?

1706
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,494
Just let me do my job here.
Just let me do this. Don't quit now.

1707
01:30:19,495 --> 01:30:22,995
If, by the end of the night, you
still wanna quit, then quit.

1708
01:30:23,078 --> 01:30:25,286
Just see what I do from here.

1709
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:27,035
Your show, Sonny.

1710
01:30:27,036 --> 01:30:28,627
Tom Michaels is holding.

1711
01:30:30,328 --> 01:30:32,035
You son of a bitch!

1712
01:30:32,036 --> 01:30:33,786
Anthony, I need five
minutes, all right?

1713
01:30:33,787 --> 01:30:35,703
Five minutes, and
then you can fire me.

1714
01:30:35,704 --> 01:30:37,202
Sonny, you are a dead man.

1715
01:30:37,203 --> 01:30:39,703
Mr. Molina. Mr. Molina.
Look at me. Look at me.

1716
01:30:39,704 --> 01:30:42,161
Just give him a minute.
He knows what he's doing.

1717
01:30:42,162 --> 01:30:43,494
Tom, it's Sonny.

1718
01:30:43,495 --> 01:30:46,578
Jesus, Mary and Whatnot. Do I
owe you a thank you, Weaver?

1719
01:30:46,579 --> 01:30:48,494
Jacksonville's on the clock

1720
01:30:48,495 --> 01:30:51,578
and I'm one more crazy
shit-show from insanity.

1721
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:55,369
Can you imagine, scoring three
first-round picks and Bo Callahan?

1722
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:59,035
Lord God, let that infant
John Carson screw this up.

1723
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:01,327
It's Jeff Carson, Tom, and
he doesn't have the pick.

1724
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:02,918
I do.

1725
01:31:04,453 --> 01:31:05,619
What?

1726
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:09,910
I just made a trade with Jacksonville.
I'm on the clock. It's me.

1727
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:10,994
Bullshit!

1728
01:31:10,995 --> 01:31:12,202
<i>The Jacksonville Jaguars

1729
01:31:12,203 --> 01:31:13,452
<i>have made a trade.

1730
01:31:13,453 --> 01:31:17,873
<i>The Cleveland Browns now have the
sixth pick and are on the clock.

1731
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:22,952
Sonny, what'd you give 'em?

1732
01:31:22,953 --> 01:31:24,536
No time for that. I'm on the clock.

1733
01:31:24,537 --> 01:31:26,661
I'm gonna pick Bo, Tom.
Unless you want him more.

1734
01:31:26,662 --> 01:31:28,619
And if so, let's make a deal.

1735
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:30,495
We still have Bo Callahan?

1736
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:32,961
What the hell's goin' on, Sonny?

1737
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:35,035
Everyone thinks there's
something wrong

1738
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:36,536
with the kid, but you
don't, all right?

1739
01:31:36,537 --> 01:31:37,661
You've done your due diligence.

1740
01:31:37,662 --> 01:31:39,661
You're about to pull off
the move of the century.

1741
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:42,628
But you need my pick to do it.
So make me an offer.

1742
01:31:44,036 --> 01:31:46,910
You've gone rogue.
You've gone renegade.

1743
01:31:46,911 --> 01:31:49,707
Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly right.

1744
01:31:50,036 --> 01:31:51,994
I could have gotten
Vontae at seven,

1745
01:31:51,995 --> 01:31:53,452
but instead I trade up with you

1746
01:31:53,453 --> 01:31:54,869
just so I could get him at one.

1747
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:57,119
Jesus Christ. You were
right about me, Tom.

1748
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,035
I am a crazy man. So, come
on, take advantage of it.

1749
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:01,751
What are you waitin' for?

1750
01:32:05,245 --> 01:32:09,166
Make me a deal, Tom, at six,
and you get your boy wonder.

1751
01:32:11,162 --> 01:32:12,708
What do you want?

1752
01:32:15,662 --> 01:32:17,910
I want my number ones
back. All of 'em.

1753
01:32:19,704 --> 01:32:22,035
That's crazy. Why would
I give them back?

1754
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,910
Because, at the end of the
day, no one's the wiser, Tom.

1755
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:26,161
You haven't lost anything

1756
01:32:26,162 --> 01:32:27,286
and you get the quarterback messiah

1757
01:32:27,287 --> 01:32:30,832
you've always wanted
for $7 million less.

1758
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:39,369
Nah. No, I can't do it. I'd look
like an idiot, like I panicked.

1759
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:40,994
<i>You take him. You
obviously don't want to.

1760
01:32:40,995 --> 01:32:42,661
<i>I'll stick with my draft picks.

1761
01:32:42,662 --> 01:32:45,077
Yeah, but you want
him, Tom, don't you?

1762
01:32:45,078 --> 01:32:47,536
Seahawks fans want a
hero and you denied 'em.

1763
01:32:47,537 --> 01:32:49,286
- Not that bad.
<i>- Don't lie to me.

1764
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:51,494
I checked all the Seahawk
fan blogs and chat rooms.

1765
01:32:51,495 --> 01:32:53,702
They're all calling for your head.

1766
01:32:53,703 --> 01:32:55,244
Ever since you traded
away Callahan,

1767
01:32:55,245 --> 01:32:56,952
the barbarians are at the gate.

1768
01:32:56,953 --> 01:32:58,661
I don't care about that.

1769
01:32:58,662 --> 01:33:02,037
Yeah, you do. You
and I both know it.

1770
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,785
I have the golden ticket now, Tom,

1771
01:33:04,786 --> 01:33:09,378
and if I give it to you, you get to
save Seahawk football in Seattle.

1772
01:33:11,703 --> 01:33:12,869
Um...

1773
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:16,244
How 'bout I give you
number two picks?

1774
01:33:16,245 --> 01:33:17,827
No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1775
01:33:17,828 --> 01:33:20,411
No, I want my picks
back. All of them.

1776
01:33:20,412 --> 01:33:23,369
I want all three years of
this team's future back.

1777
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,411
That's not fair!

1778
01:33:24,412 --> 01:33:25,869
Well, you wanna cry about it, Tom,

1779
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:27,077
or you wanna make a little magic

1780
01:33:27,078 --> 01:33:29,419
before the clock runs
out on both of us?

1781
01:33:30,245 --> 01:33:33,327
$7 million cheaper solves
our salary cap problem.

1782
01:33:33,328 --> 01:33:35,161
We're still gonna give
the fans what they want.

1783
01:33:35,162 --> 01:33:36,411
Okay. Screw it!

1784
01:33:36,412 --> 01:33:38,286
No more offer. It's
off the table, Tom.

1785

Wait, wait!

1787

Yeah. Putney.

Haven't I proved that already?

1809
01:34:40,744 --> 01:34:43,994
You make this deal right now,
Tom, and you get Bo Callahan.

1810
01:34:43,995 --> 01:34:45,495
Say it with me.

Hold on. Looks like Cleveland's
making another trade.

We got a trade.

1819

Okay, this means we're
picking next, all right?

Back at seven, where we started.

1821

Ray Jennings.

That's right. Cleveland royalty.

1825
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,869
Haven't I been telling
everybody that

1826
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:44,086
that's what we need,
a running back?

1827

Still wanna quit, Coach?

1828

What?

1829
01:35:48,162 --> 01:35:50,369
Does this sound like a
team that you wanna coach?

1830
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,161
Because the Browns
are ready to roll.

1831
01:35:52,162 --> 01:35:54,412
We just need the right
man at the wheel.

1832
01:35:55,703 --> 01:35:57,577
I can coach this team.

1833
01:35:57,578 --> 01:35:59,369
I know you can.

1834
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:01,743
Why don't you give
Ray Jennings a call?

1835
01:36:01,744 --> 01:36:03,827
Ask him if he wants to be a Brown.

1836
01:36:03,828 --> 01:36:06,874
Then tell him to pack his bags
so he can join us at our party.

My pleasure, boss.

He sprinkled it with fairy
dust, wished upon a star,

1856
01:38:08,578 --> 01:38:11,327

01:39:05,327 --> 01:39:08,743
<i>If he thinks Callahan's a bust,
who am I to argue with that?

1878
01:39:08,744 --> 01:39:12,077
<i>He turned nothin' into
a big-time somethin'.

1879
01:39:12,078 --> 01:39:13,577
Smile for the cameras, Coach.

1880
01:39:13,578 --> 01:39:16,326
<i>This is a day for
Cleveland to celebrate.

1881
01:39:16,327 --> 01:39:18,451
We had a great day!

1882
01:39:18,452 --> 01:39:23,410
Super Bowl! Super Bowl! Super Bowl!

1883
01:39:31,286 --> 01:39:34,410
That was gonna go
down a different way.

1884
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:35,911
Mom?

1885
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,870
There you are.

1886
01:39:40,036 --> 01:39:41,368
You okay?

1887
01:39:41,369 --> 01:39:43,577
Yeah. It was just so
noisy downstairs,

1888
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:46,124
I had to get a few
minutes of quiet.

1889
01:39:46,494 --> 01:39:48,665
We're taking off.

1890
01:39:48,828 --> 01:39:51,203
You sure you're gonna be okay?

1891
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:56,743
I think your dad would have been

1892
01:39:56,744 --> 01:39:59,460
very happy to coach
a team like this.

1893
01:40:06,828 --> 01:40:08,999
I think so, too.

1894
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,744
Thank you.

1895
01:40:14,703 --> 01:40:17,827
Look, we gotta go.

1896
01:40:17,828 --> 01:40:21,204
Of course. It was a long day.

1897
01:40:23,286 --> 01:40:25,377
Bye, Ali.

1898
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:29,161
Good night, Barb.

1899
01:40:32,578 --> 01:40:34,078
Hey, Mom.

1900
01:40:39,327 --> 01:40:41,623
We're gonna have a baby.

1901
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,377
You're gonna be a grandma.

1902
01:40:54,953 --> 01:40:56,998
Thank you.

1903
01:41:06,286 --> 01:41:08,037
Wow!

1904
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,915
That was big.

1905
01:41:12,327 --> 01:41:14,327
I'll get my stuff.

1906
01:41:54,578 --> 01:41:55,660
Joe.

1907
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:58,160
Hey, Anthony, you did a hell
of a job with the Draft.

1908
01:41:58,161 --> 01:41:59,743
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Jim.

1909
01:41:59,744 --> 01:42:00,910
Very impressive, Anthony.

1910
01:42:00,911 --> 01:42:02,451
Thanks, Bernie.

1911
01:42:02,452 --> 01:42:04,793
I can't take all the credit.

1912
01:42:04,995 --> 01:42:06,368
But I will.
