1
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,933
<i>In reykjavík, Iceland today,</i>

2
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,903
<i>Bobby fischer failed to show up</i>
<i>for his second game</i>
<i>against Boris spassky.</i>

3
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,885
<i>Unpredictable Bobby fischer</i>
<i>stayed in bed today</i>

4
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,787
<i> rather than show up</i>
<i> for game 2</i>

5
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,290
<i>in his world title match</i>
<i>with chess champion</i>
<i>Boris spassky of Russia.</i>

6
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,794
<i>The match between the world's</i>
<i>chess champion, Boris spassky,</i>
<i>and Bobby fischer</i>

7
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,762
<i>took a strange turn</i>

8
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:15,567
<i>when fischer failed to show up</i>
<i>at the scheduled time</i>
<i>and forfeited game 2.</i>

9
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,770
<i>The entire world seems</i>
<i>to be asking the same question:</i>

10
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,839
<i>"What will Bobby fischer</i>
<i> do next?"</i>

11
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,659
Half the witnesses
they call are communists.
The other half are Jews.

12
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,528
If you're both,
do you testify twice?

13
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,196
- Go ahead.
- Make jokes, Mr. liberal.

14
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,599
Your entire family
wasn't gassed
at the camps.

15
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,543
Mama.

16
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,345
Mama!
Not now, Bobby.

17
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,847
I have to talk to you!

18
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,784
Bobby, it's past
your bedtime.

19
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,553
Joan?

20
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,022
There's
a car out there!

21
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,524
- What car?
- You told me to tell you.

22
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,460
A red 1952 Chevy.

23
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,202
Bobby,
you remember
what I told you?

24
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:33,572
There are
bad people out there
who wanna intimidate us

25
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:37,609
because we represent something
very threatening to them,
to the status quo.

26
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,911
You remember
what that is?
Revolution.

27
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:44,216
Yes. And sometimes
these bad people wanna
know about our work.

28
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,051
So they spy on us.

29
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:48,987
So... if someone comes up
to you in the street

30
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,957
and asks you questions
about me or mommy's friends,
what do you say?

31
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,392
"I have nothing
to say to you."

32
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,795
That's my big boy.

33
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,434
Yuck. Joan. Joan.
Joan. He's got mustard
on his shirt.

34
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,969
He's gotta wear that
to school tomorrow.

35
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,738
- Would you soak it for me?
- Love to.

36
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,408
- And put him to bed.
<i>- Bedtime for bonzo.</i>

37
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,074
I'm carmine nigro,
and I'm told
you are a chess player.

38
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,511
Our church-- all colors
and creeds welcome.

39
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,787
Bobby.

40
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,123
Choose.

41
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,528
Let's see
what we got here, eh?

42
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,198
Most young people
don't have the concentration
to play at a high level,

43
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,133
so please don't get
your hopes up.

44
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,703
Ha! He's beaten everyone
he's ever played.

45
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,873
My hopes are he will
give up on the damn game
if someone beats him.

46
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,377
Okay.
It's your move.

47
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,881
Do you like baseball,
Bobby?

48
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:34,252
- Hmm? Jackie Robinson?
Pee wee Reese?
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,555
Bobby, have you
ever been to the moon
on the subway?

50
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,490
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:42,160
If I take the pieces away,
he just keeps playing
in his head. Day and night.

52
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,496
Took him to a shrink.
He said to come here.

53
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:48,366
Well, his game is good.
Not exceptional though.

54
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,339
Hmm.

55
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,687
- Who taught him
to move like this?
- He taught himself.

56
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,361
Bobby, shall we
call it a draw?

57
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,398
Hmm?

58
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,773
He hates draws.

59
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,286
Check.

60
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,061
Mate.

61
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,316
I'm officially
the 25th best chess player
in New York City.

62
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,218
I can tell you
he has great potential.

63
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,463
Come here.
Come--

64
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,069
again.

65
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,271
Carmine,
it's your move!

66
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,040
I know
it's my move.

67
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,475
Come on!
I'm thinking.

68
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,950
<i>Come on, carmine.</i>
<i>It's your turn.</i>

69
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,619
Bobby, I know
it's my turn.
Just go.

70
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,627
- <i> Come on!</i>
<i>- Bobby, I still have time</i>
<i> on the clock, okay?</i>

71
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,429
-<i> Let me think.</i>
- Fine.

72
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,777
<i>There's a rising star</i>
<i>in the chess world,</i>

73
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,546
<i>and he's only 12 years old.</i>

74
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,481
<i>His name is Bobby fischer.</i>

75
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,084
<i>Today he played</i>
<i>American master Donald byrne</i>

76
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:23,154
and beat him in what
is already being described
as the game of the century.

77
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,823
So, Bobby,
what's next for you?

78
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,126
It's either I beat them,
or they beat me.
You know?

79
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,428
<i>With an impressive string</i>
<i>of five victories,</i>

80
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,732
<i>Bobby today became</i>
<i>the youngest ever</i>
<i>United States chess champion.</i>

81
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,241
Ooh.

82
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,274
Oh, you're back.

83
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,744
And you won.
Congratulations.

84
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,781
Every night
i hear you two screw.

85
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,584
Bobby,
put those down.
Bobby.

86
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,287
Shut up, size 12.
You live in<i> my</i> house,
and you're not my father.

87
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,756
Okay?
Bobby.

88
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,624
- Where<i> is</i> my father?
- Come on.

89
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,760
I was born, right?
What did you do with him?

90
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,762
Is he on earth?
Does he even exist?

91
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,965
Honey, that was
a long time ago.

92
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,101
So what?
You can't remember?
Where is he?

93
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,302
Gone.

94
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,538
- Gone where?
- It doesn't matter.

95
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,640
It matters to me.

96
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,111
You know what?

97
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,946
Get the fuck out of here.

98
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,550
You know wha--
go-- go back to Moscow
with your commie friends.

99
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,787
I am studying
day and night.

100
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,622
And I'm gonna be
the next world champion.

101
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,625
Do you understand me?
I need silence.

102
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,594
Do you understand?
I want silence.

103
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,643
Mom says
you're staying
at the chess club.

104
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,211
It's quiet there.

105
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,916
And what
about high school? Hmm?

106
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,651
Huh.
Yeah.

107
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,519
She still there?

108
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,621
She fixed up
the apartment.

109
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,024
Even got
the hot-water heater
working.

110
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,662
She won't be
living there anymore.

111
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:54,299
She's going
to do politics
in California with cyril.

112
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,467
You mean king Kong.
Mate.

113
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,369
Mom was worried.

114
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,873
She thought
if they went away,
you'd go home,

115
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,008
sleep in a bed.

116
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,643
That's what
she told you? Huh?

117
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,946
And you bought it?

118
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:11,015
She's running away
with some nutcase
bigfoot communist.

119
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,351
Oh, oh,
and you know what?
It's for Bobby's benefit.

120
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,787
You said
you wanted quiet.

121
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,122
You won, Bobby.

122
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,757
Be happy.

123
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,365
<i>In portoroz, yugoslavia today,</i>

124
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,234
<i>American chess prodigy</i>
<i>Bobby fischer</i>

125
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,370
<i>became the youngest</i>
<i>ever grandmaster</i>
<i>in the history of the game.</i>

126
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,673
Congratulations, Bobby.
Where do you go from here?

127
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,476
Well, uh, I wanna play
the Russians.

128
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,645
They're the best in the world,
and I'm gonna beat 'em all.

129
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,104
<i>Having won the interzonal,</i>

130
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,439
<i>he is the odds-on favorite</i>
<i>to win the candidates</i>
<i>tournament</i>

131
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,409
<i>and gain a match against</i>
<i>the current world champion.</i>

132
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,785
How are you feeling?
I'm ready.
It's my time.

133
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,793
Mr. spassky,
a quick chat, please.

134
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,812
This is ridiculous.

135
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,315
King to rook three.
Knight to king six.

136
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,251
Pawn takes queen.
Bishop to knight seven.
It's over.

137
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,026
The Russians are
drawing games on purpose
to save their strength

138
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,861
and they're dumping games
to pad their points,

139
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,663
making it statistically
impossible for me to win.

140
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:16,000
Mr. fischer, your complaint
has been lodged.
There's nothing we can do.

141
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,702
Of course there's
something you can do.

142
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,471
They're playing a team game.
It's five guys against one.
Against me!

143
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,540
Can we go back inside?
No, I'm not interested.

144
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,575
Bobby, don't--
what the hell are you
doing about this anyways?

145
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,345
All right.
Come here. Gather around.
I got something to say.

146
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,680
I wanna make this very clear.

147
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,549
The Russians are cheats.

148
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,484
Everybody knows
what's going on.

149
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,987
The corrupt federation
does nothing to stop it!

150
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,490
There can be
no legitimate world champ
if I'm not playing.

151
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,727
And I'm not gonna play,
because this is unfair.

152
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,730
It's unjust.
It's immoral!
I quit.

153
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,833
I don't just quit
this tournament.
I am quitting chess.

154
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,570
Move. Move.

155
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,072
Bobby.

156
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,408
Bobby, wait.
We'll go back inside
and apologize.

157
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,343
You can
still place well.
What are you talking about?

158
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,212
This was it!

159
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:04,382
What do you think I've been
working the past 10 years
of my life for?

160
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:08,419
I was gonna be the youngest
world champ in the history
of the game! That's over now!

161
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,189
They stole it
from me, carmine.
They took it!

162
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:14,292
That was today! Today!

163
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,365
- English.
- This is America.

164
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,337
Ah, the American boy
who hates us, but cannot
resist our magazines.

165
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,873
Spassky is becoming
the new Messiah.

166
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,743
They say he won't
ever lose a match.

167
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,880
Someone left this
for you.

168
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,682
A lawyer.

169
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,617
You are in trouble,
maybe?

170
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,616
Do you want a game?

171
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,252
You think
I'm stupid?

172
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,021
So you know who I am.
Yeah,
i know who you are.

173
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,757
I've been trying
to reach you. You don't
answer your phone.

174
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,561
Oh. You're--
you're that lawyer.

175
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,863
What'd I do?
Nothing.

176
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,699
Nothing.
You did nothing.

177
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,335
You do nothing.
That's why I'm here.

178
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,403
I read your article
in<i> sports illustrated.</i>

179
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,872
You told the truth
about the Russians.
Yeah, that's right, I did.

180
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,641
Did you see this?

181
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,546
"Soviet invasion
to hit California surf."

182
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,549
"World's greatest
chess players to visit us."
Yeah, I saw that.

183
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:55,853
They say it's just
a game... for fun, hand of
friendship, all that crap.

184
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,589
You know the truth.
They're laughing at us.

185
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,458
They think
their chess dominance...

186
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,795
Proves Soviet
intellectual superiority
over the decadent west.

187
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,631
I don't really care
about politics.

188
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:10,134
They're using chess
to say "screw America."
I'm about the game, you see.

189
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,136
Two guys at a board,
one makes a move,

190
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,372
the other makes a move,
and that's it.

191
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,608
I'm a chess fan myself.

192
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm also
hopelessly patriotic.

193
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,019
I take an interest
in people like yourself,
creative people.

194
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,457
I create the wherewithal
that allows them to do
what they do.

195
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,560
Ask Jimi Hendrix.
Ask the rolling stones.

196
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,562
If I can help them,
i can help anybody.

197
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:42,233
I'd like
to represent you,
Mr. fischer.

198
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,268
So you're out
to make a buck.

199
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,404
No, I don't need the money.
I'd be doing this for free.

200
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,572
Pro bono.

201
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,809
You're the one man
in this country
who could put up a fight.

202
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,744
Maybe even
beat them.

203
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,180
I'd like a front-row seat
when the good guys win.

204
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,185
If I went back to competition,
there'd have to be
some real changes.

205
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,820
It's got to be fair.

206
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,456
If you're serious
about playing,

207
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,358
I'll see what I can do.

208
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,761
That is if you
still wanna play.

209
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,265
Call me.

210
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,718
He's very excited
about this.

211
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,353
I'm only a selector
on the committee.

212
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,456
You see, he apologizes
to the federation.

213
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,025
With profanity
on the first line.

214
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,328
Ah. Well, he's--
he's nursed a grudge.

215
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,896
Mm-hmm.
For a long time.

216
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:49,033
He's studied
how the Russians play.

217
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,168
Every day.
Eighteen hours a day.

218
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,970
For four years.
Mm-hmm.

219
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:57,508
For him, uh, Vietnam
and the Beatles
never happened.

220
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,845
I'm guessing he still
has his opinions
about the Soviets?

221
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,315
Well, you'll promise
the committee, we'll
keep him out of trouble.

222
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:07,385
The piatigorsky
was organized to build Bridges,
not to burn them.

223
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,390
Well, so we lose 12-0,
and that's a bridge?

224
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,260
He asked for you.

225
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,628
Wants you
to be his second.

226
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,832
He respects you.

227
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,567
You're the only one
who ever beat spassky.

228
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,003
We were young.
He'd destroy me now.

229
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,542
And...
You've beaten Bobby.

230
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,444
That was a long time ago.

231
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,748
Bobby has problems.

232
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,484
So did Mozart.

233
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,589
He might crack.

234
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,293
Bobby won't crack.

235
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,096
He will explode.

236
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,370
Bobby?
Bill's here.
Oh.

237
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,238
Hey, Bobby,
how you doing?

238
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,774
Against petrosian in Zurich,
you sacrificed
your king's pawn.

239
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,776
You know that's the thing
that got you, right?

240
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,646
You always play too cautiously
and you go crazy
in the other direction.

241
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,648
That's--
that's a real weakness.

242
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,219
-Hey, if I criticize
a priest, do I go to hell?
-Depends if you believe in hell.

243
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,488
Yeah.
All right.

244
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,192
- I'm gonna show you how you
could have won in 13 moves.
- Huh.

245
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,495
Castle, pawn,

246
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,831
knight, bishop, rook.

247
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,567
That's you.
All right.

248
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,735
King goes there.
Pawns.

249
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,607
All right.
Now, here-- here's
where you screwed up.

250
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,577
You got greedy, and you
traded knight for bishop.

251
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,812
- And you sacrificed
your pawn, right?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:47,184
Now, what if you'd
done this instead?

253
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,756
You see, the Russians
are like boa constrictors.

254
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,426
If you do nothing,
they strangle you to death.

255
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:58,696
But if you confuse him,
you attack him
from everywhere.

256
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,098
Then all they
can do is react.

257
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,002
Now, here, you see,
i got my machine gun lined up,
bearing down on the king.

258
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,338
Now, he tries
to defend himself.

259
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,876
I sacrifice my rook,
and now the real attack begins.

260
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:12,910
Check.

261
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,981
Check. Take.

262
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:20,317
Hey, Bobby, you know,
this tournament's
about... diplomacy.

263
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,954
No, this tournament,
like all tournaments,
is about winning.

264
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,656
So--

265
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,324
okay, well,
the rook takes bishop.

266
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,994
Of course.
Now, he thinks he's safe,

267
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,296
but I've been developing
a plot to kill his king.

268
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,365
You see, my rook
is sitting there waiting,

269
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,866
forgotten about
in the background.

270
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,968
I bring him into the hunt.

271
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,337
Now, the king flees.

272
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,374
Even his beloved queen
can't do anything.

273
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,210
She's just sitting there,
watching.
Mm-hmm.

274
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:49,847
As the noose tightens.
And finally,

275
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,448
he sees the end.

276
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,184
Holy shit.

277
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,154
Hey. I didn't know a priest
could use bad language.

278
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,357
I like this guy.

279
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,660
So, uh, we going
to California?

280
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,614
<i>This is 93 khj Los Angeles.</i>

281
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,050
<i>Don't be fooled</i>
<i>by the warm weather, kids,</i>

282
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:29,687
<i>because the cold war</i>
<i>just blew into town.</i>

283
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:33,390
<i>The Soviet chess team</i>
<i>arrived today in la</i>
<i>for a goodwill tournament.</i>

284
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:37,461
<i>With them is</i>
<i>the current world champion,</i>
<i>Boris spassky.</i>

285
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,567
<i>The comrades are booked</i>
<i>into the Beverly Hilton hotel.</i>

286
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,136
<i>So much</i>
<i>for working-class values.</i>

287
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:51,141
<i>If you're listening, guys,</i>
<i>welcome to the free world</i>
<i>and enjoy the sunshine.</i>

288
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,240
It's really hot in here.
What's going on?

289
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:24,942
Repair guy didn't show.

290
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,611
You know,
you promised hotels.
This place is a real dive.

291
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,680
Are you a rock star?
He acts like a rock star.

292
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,515
You realize I have
to prepare, right?

293
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,118
- Right?
- Yeah.

294
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,686
- Well, you know what?
- What?

295
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:39,156
- I ain't stayin' here.
- Bobby.

296
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,492
These are
improved accommodations?

297
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,327
This is improved.
Staying at a roach motel.

298
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,962
Somebody else
is paying for it.

299
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,497
Yeah, well, where are
the Russians staying?

300
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,998
We don't have
their kind of money.

301
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,933
Didn't we invent money?

302
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,670
- We rely on private donors.
- Yeah, right.

303
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,605
The Russians, they get
whatever they want,

304
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,507
because they know
what it takes to win.

305
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,610
And I end up staying
next to route 66.

306
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,179
All I want is some quiet!

307
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,580
So stop yelling.

308
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,119
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

309
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,055
Sorry.

310
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:14,491
- What's your name?
- I'm Donna.

311
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:18,395
Oh, well, uh--
yeah, I'll see you later, Donna.
I'm going for a walk.

312
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,397
Want some company?

313
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,333
Uh, sure.

314
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,736
Wait.
I'll be right there.

315
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,873
Uh--

316
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,076
and he hasn't even
started playing.

317
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,208
You walk pretty fast.

318
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,312
This all you
wanted to do?

319
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,249
We could sit down.

320
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,151
Oh. Okay.

321
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,760
So, what do you do,
Donna?

322
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,562
I screw people.

323
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,631
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

324
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,768
Oh. So do I.

325
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,303
Hmm.

326
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,143
Listen. Uh, I was thinking
about getting rid
of my virginity.

327
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,080
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

328
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,991
Bishop to queen three.

329
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,760
Bishop to knight five.

330
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:32,162
Knight
to knight five.

331
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:35,599
Uh, king rook to queen one.

332
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,368
Uh, queen to knight four.

333
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,637
Ah.

334
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,540
Yeah, that's not even me.
It's, uh, morphy
versus anderssen.

335
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,577
Pawn to queen rook four.

336
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,680
Queen to king seven.

337
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,850
Queen takes queen.
Rook takes queen.

338
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,952
Shit!

339
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,654
Hey. You ready?
Yeah.

340
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,456
Background
on the Soviets.

341
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,291
You're kidding, right?
Uh--

342
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,861
yeah, I know every game
every one of these guys
has ever played.

343
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,230
You know,
they're sitting by the pool
at their fancy hotel,

344
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,131
laughing, having drinks.

345
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,235
They have no idea.

346
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,303
You guys coming?

347
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,239
I think he's ready.
Yeah.

348
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,016
Bobby's disappeared.
He'll be here.

349
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,151
If he's not seated
in three minutes,
he forfeits.

350
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,020
He'll be here.
Yeah? A little prayer
wouldn't hurt.

351
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,922
I pray
for his opponent.

352
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,660
- Bobby, you here?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

353
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,929
What the hell?
You've got, like, seconds
to take your seat.

354
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,431
Great. If my mom comes,
would you give that to her?
Yes.

355
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,034
She lives in California now,
so you never know.
She might show.

356
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,936
Bobby, you've drawn Ivanovich
in the first round.

357
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,572
Hey, whatever you do,
don't let her get in.
It screws up my game.

358
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,108
I told her she could
listen on the radio.

359
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,944
Bobby, Ivanovich is
officially the third
best chess player in the world.

360
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,579
Fourth.

361
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,416
Fourth.

362
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,255
If he doesn't make
his move in 60 seconds,
the game will be forfeited.

363
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,357
Adjust.

364
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:34,144
<i>Americans don't</i>
<i>beat Russians at chess.</i>

365
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:37,147
<i>But it happened today</i>
<i>in Santa Monica.</i>

366
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,183
<i>And when American</i>
<i>chess sensation</i>
<i>Bobby fischer's around,</i>

367
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,185
<i>it just keeps on happening.</i>

368
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,024
We have
a problem.

369
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,059
<i>...are going</i>
<i>to be here any minute.</i>

370
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,461
<i> Look at this place.</i>

371
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,898
Mr. fischer?

372
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,236
Yeah. I've decided
I'm not playing again

373
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,804
until all my conditions
are met.

374
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,574
What, uh, conditions?

375
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:08,478
First off, I wanna arrive
in a big black car,

376
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,213
you know,
just like the Russians.

377
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,149
Uh, limousines
cost money.

378
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,085
Number two-- you know
i was on the front page
of the<i> la times</i> today?

379
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:17,154
Ticket sales
are through the roof.
Mm-hmm.

380
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:20,757
A thousand people
are paying $5.00 apiece
just to see me play.

381
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,559
That's $5,000.
Mm.

382
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,494
I want 30%.
That's 1,500.

383
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:27,931
- Uh, Bobby--
- no. Money's respect, Paul.

384
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:32,069
And number three--
i want at least five feet
between me and the audience.

385
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:34,271
You know,
i can smell their breath.

386
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,506
It's almost like I hear
their thoughts, you know.

387
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,675
- My thoughts need
to be on the board.

388
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,283
- Is that all?
- Well, why don't you
have someone check

389
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,918
and make sure our phones
aren't being bugged.

390
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,519
The rest
is on the list.

391
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,534
Hey. Hi.

392
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,903
So, uh, I heard you won.

393
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,605
So congrats.
Oh, thanks.

394
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,274
What's wrong with the phone
in your room?

395
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,477
Oh, I heard
this click-click.

396
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,046
I thought maybe, you know,
my phone was bugged.

397
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:18,949
Who you calling?
Uh, hold--
hello. Operator?

398
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,918
I'm looking for a number
for Regina fischer.

399
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,455
Um, I don't know.
I thought maybe, um--

400
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,257
well, I don't know.
Somewhere near the beach.

401
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,826
I'm in Santa Monica,
so-- I don't know--
maybe somewhere around here?

402
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,129
I'm making sure my mom
doesn't come tomorrow.

403
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:34,164
She can be distracting.

404
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,666
And I'll say hello
to her and--

405
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,735
hello?
Uh--

406
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,804
oh, okay.

407
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,405
Well, never mind then.

408
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,578
So, you wanna lose
your virginity tonight?

409
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,447
Oh. Uh--

410
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,082
well, I haven't forgotten
about our arrangement,

411
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,850
and I am looking
forward to it.

412
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,653
But, uh--
but I gotta stay
focused tonight.

413
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,922
I slaughtered
one of them today,

414
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,024
so tomorrow
they're gonna come
at me like banshees.

415
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,196
Okay.
All right.

416
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,764
Uh--
well, good luck.

417
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,366
See you later.

418
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,009
I passed up having sex
for this.

419
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,612
Passed it up
for 20 years.

420
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,452
- Patty melt.
- Got it.

421
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,450
<i> So, Boris, it looks</i>
<i> like Bobby has improved</i>
<i> his game.</i>

422
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,918
<i> What do you think?</i>

423
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,391
<i>Tomorrow,</i>
<i>a record crowd will watch</i>
<i>the American, Bobby fischer,</i>

424
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:45,895
<i>as he faces Russian</i>
<i>world champion Boris spassky</i>
<i>in the final match.</i>

425
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:50,033
<i>Fischer, whose demands</i>
<i>for more money have infuriated</i>
<i>tournament promoters,</i>

426
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:53,603
<i>has won a remarkable</i>
<i>eight matches in a row.</i>

427
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,007
<i>But tomorrow will definitely</i>
<i>be his greatest test.</i>

428
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,711
Pawn to king three.

429
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,581
Queen to king one.
Knight to rook four.

430
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,116
What?

431
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,951
Uh--

432
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:11,621
I, uh-- I like to play
the king's Indian,

433
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,923
but he's an expert
on the sãmisch, so, uh--

434
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,558
who?
Uh, spassky.

435
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,260
So I thought
maybe a grünfeld,

436
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:20,830
but-- but then I have
to find an answer
to pawn bishop four.

437
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:24,734
You know, I was wondering,
did you reach your mom yet?

438
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,237
I bet she'd be proud.

439
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,642
Uh, I need
to go through this.

440
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,578
I need to work--
work through this,
so I thought maybe--

441
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,213
uh--

442
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,118
sure. Yeah.

443
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,687
Well, that was great
for me too.

444
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:46,489
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

445
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,664
How you feeling?

446
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,867
I'm fine.

447
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,568
Did you eat?

448
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,904
You mind not talking?

449
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,746
That's good.
Okay.

450
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,581
Thanks.

451
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,979
Bobby, how does
it feel to lose?
That's a stupid question.

452
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:53,450
How'd he beat you, Bob?
Would you understand
if I answered that?

453
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,118
He was playing to draw.

454
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,953
Bobby, no one
expected you
to beat spassky.

455
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,488
I did.

456
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,256
They're waiting
to give you
the runner's-up medal.

457
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,225
No thanks.

458
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,260
At least, uh--
ah, forget him.

459
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,628
Talk to
the TV people!
Forget him.

460
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,956
He's disappeared.
He'll be back.

461
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,893
What makes you
so sure?

462
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:13,062
It's all that matters to him.
Without chess, he doesn't exist.

463
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:16,199
You think
he can ever beat spassky?

464
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:21,237
Hypothetically,
what would it take
to make him world champion?

465
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,543
The desk clerk asked
why we were making
so many calls to DC.

466
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,578
I haven't
been calling DC.

467
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,849
Who have you
been talking to?
People in high places

468
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:35,051
who take an interest
in any confrontation

469
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,854
between us
and the Soviet union.
State department? CIA?

470
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:39,656
White house?

471
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,824
Bobby wants limos,
he gets limos.

472
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,160
And they'll throw
in honorariums
for each victory.

473
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,062
Paid for by whom?

474
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,299
Are you a patriot,
father?

475
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,069
Mostly.

476
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,271
Bobby may be
a little off,

477
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,774
but he understands
this whole thing
better than you.

478
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,909
We're at war.

479
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,845
Only it's not being fought
by guns and missiles.

480
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,414
Not yet, at least.

481
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,749
It's a war
of perception.

482
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:12,021
The poor kid from Brooklyn
against the whole
Soviet empire.

483
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,756
The perfect
American story.

484
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,092
So your interest in this
is ideological.

485
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,563
But what's in it for<i> you?</i>

486
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:25,034
There's such a thing
as doing well by doing good.

487
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,070
And you haven't answered
my question.

488
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:28,504
Bobby fischer--

489
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,143
Bobby fischer
is the second best chess player
I've ever seen.

490
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,282
He's also got
severe problems
in his head.

491
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,718
Which need
to be understood
and managed.

492
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,286
Managed?
Bobby?

493
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,224
You ever hear
of Paul morphy?

494
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,959
1855.

495
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,461
Greatest player
this country ever had.

496
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:53,429
Before Bobby, that is.

497
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,165
But by 21,

498
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:59,135
he'd beat every master
in Europe.

499
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,071
But then...

500
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,741
Things started to get
a little weird.

501
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,310
He started
having visions

502
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:11,014
and became convinced
that people were trying
to poison him,

503
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,515
and he quit...

504
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,518
At 26.

505
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,288
And eventually
killed himself

506
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,225
in a bathtub
surrounded by 12 pairs
of ladies' shoes.

507
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,396
So... this game--

508
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,269
it's a rabbit hole.

509
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,107
After only four moves,

510
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,777
there's more than
300 billion options
to consider.

511
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:45,148
There's more 40-move games
than there are stars
in the galaxy.

512
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,685
So... it can take you
very close to the edge.

513
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,128
Could he win?

514
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,501
If-if Bobby were
to go for the title,

515
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,305
it would mean traveling
around the world playing
tournaments for three years.

516
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:11,674
In my opinion,
he might not make it
that long.

517
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,242
It's your job
to see that he does.

518
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,217
If we can ever find him.

519
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,120
Holy shit.

520
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,089
They following me?

521
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,192
Hey!

522
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:06,129
Hey! Hey!

523
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:09,766
Hey! Over here!
You guys following me?

524
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,735
Hey!

525
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,304
You're soft!
You got your guys!

526
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,673
You're a stooge!
I got nothing!

527
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,245
Hey!
Where you going?

528
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:23,880
I'm talking to you!

529
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,649
Hey!
Where you going?

530
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,220
I'm coming for you!

531
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,489
I'm coming
for you!

532
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,396
<i>This is</i> BBC news.

<i>Today in Hungary,</i>

534
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,402
<i>American Bobby fischer returned</i>
<i>to international competition</i>

535
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,472

536
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,408

537
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,315
<i>And so begins</i>

00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:04,120

539
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:06,522
Bobby, you dominated
the competition.

540
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:09,091
How do you feel?
I feel good.

541
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:12,161
Uh, you know, these--
these guys didn't
offer me much competition.

542
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:17,834
<i>I see this</i>
<i>as an obstacle course</i>
<i>to the world championship,</i>

543
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,536
and then, uh--
then they'll have to agree
to the conditions I want.

544
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,605
Over here, Bobby.

545
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,208
- You think the Russians
are worried about you?
- Oh, yeah.

546
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,611
They've been worried
about me ever since
i started playing chess.

547
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:30,313
You know, I'm kinda picking
these guys off,

548
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,215
but, uh, they've
been preparing for me,

549
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,350
so you never know
what's up their sleeve.
Bobby, over here!

550
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,352
<i>Think anybody can beat you?</i>

551
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,807
<i> The tide of history</i>
<i> is changing, friend.</i>

552
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:00,409
<i> God's plan</i>
<i> has left them behind,</i>

553
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:03,546
<i> so they plot to take</i>
<i> the world away from god.</i>

554
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,849
<i> They seek to destroy</i>
<i> our great Christian nation.</i>

555
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:10,920
<i> As it is written</i>
<i> in revelations 18,</i>
<i> he will use one nation</i>

556
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:13,089
what are you listening to?
<i>To punish another nation.</i>

557
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,824
<i>He will take vengeance</i>
<i>on this modern devil.</i>

558
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:16,726
You mind closing the door?

559
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:20,263
<i>And they will do anything</i>
<i>in their power to destroy us.</i>
Sure.

560
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:23,599
<i>Theirs is</i>
<i>an international conspiracy.</i>

561
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,269
<i>Mossad, kgb,</i>

562
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:29,071
<i>the military</i>
<i>industrial complex</i>

563
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,374
<i>and an unholy cabal</i>
<i>of Jewish banks.</i>

564
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:32,942
Joanie,
joanie, joanie.

565
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:35,544
I'm between
three airports and hell.

566
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:39,081
I have 10 minutes in New York
to see my wife, kiss my kids,
talk to you.

567
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,684
How the hell you been?
You're looking great.

568
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,786
I have to see him.

569
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,788
Every time I call,
they say his phone
is broken.

570
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,259
- That happens.
- You mean he breaks them.

571
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,698
I wanna take him
to see a doctor.

572
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,235
Ah, well, that just
won't be possible.

573
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,137
He's already
in Vancouver.

574
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,873
These.

575
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,208
Every week,

576
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,411
his letters, they--

577
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,780
they get more cra--

578
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,949
more crazy.
Take a look.
Go ahead.

579
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,918
Um, they're private letters
to you, Joan.

580
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,887
I, um--

581
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,789
I respect his privacy.

582
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,893
I showed them to
a psychiatrist friend.

583
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:27,563
He said that Bobby
is displaying signs
of, um--

584
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:32,568
uh-- of paranoia
and delusional psychosis.

585
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:36,906
Well, you know, uh,
chess is a crazy world.

586
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:39,842
Some of the things he says
about the Soviets are true.

587
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:43,179
In Tunis, we found
listening devices
in his hotel room.

588
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,820
"The communists...

589
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,789
Infect my mind with words
that just keep repeating.

590
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,926
The Jews are
helping them too.

591
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,695
The Jews wanna keep
the chess federation
all to themselves

592
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,430
just like
they own New York

593
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:03,432
and own and control
most governments
in the world."

594
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:06,435
We-- we--
we are Jewish.

595
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,871
Bobby is Jewish.

596
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:11,207
What do you people say to him
when he comes out
with this trash?

597
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:16,345
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

598
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,448
Joanie, look, I swear,
this isn't just
about the title anymore.

599
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,684
It's about the kind
of games he's playing.

600
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,220
Out of all
the crazy stuff,

601
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:29,291
such...
Unimaginable beauty.

602
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:32,461
A Da Vinci,
they're saying,
from Brooklyn.

603
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:35,531
Once every what,
500 years?

604
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:40,936
Grandmasters
are watching Bobby play
with tears in their eyes.

605
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,549
Joanie, look,
I'll take care of him.

606
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,584
Okay?
I'll take care of him.

607
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:01,223
I'll make sure his life
doesn't get too crazy.

608
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,160
There he is! There he is!
Bobby, right here.

609
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:06,729
You've never beaten
spassky before. Why do you
think you can beat him now?

610
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,737
Bobby, look at me.

611
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,173
<i>This is</i> BBC news.

612
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:21,043
<i> Today, Bobby fischer</i>
<i> beat Russian grandmaster</i>
<i> tigran petrosian...</i>

613
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:23,679
<i> In the semifinal</i>

614
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:26,415

<i>the current world champion,</i>
<i>Boris spassky.</i>

615
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,251
Bobby, with this win
you're guaranteed a shot
at the championship.

616
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,021
How does it feel?
It's about time.
I always said I was the best.

617
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:34,356
Everyone said,
"oh, he's an arrogant,
terrible, conceited person."

618
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,426
But now it's just an
obvious fact I'm the best.
You've never beaten spassky.

619
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,562
The Russians are saying
you don't have a chance.

620
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:42,231
I don't care two cents
about him one way or the other.
He's just another guy.

621
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,100
What's this
about the Russians
spying on you?

622
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,968
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.
They, uh--

623
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,737
I've seen them following me.
They bugged the phones
in my hotel rooms.

624
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,440
I heard they can even listen
through the fillings
in your teeth.

625
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,609
- You're kidding, right?
- I'm not kidding.
Go see your dentist.

626
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,578
Petrosian said
he wasn't well.

627
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,080
He's the second Russian
to get sick playing you.
They're all getting sick.

628
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:01,417

You know, I don't wanna
get distracted doing
a bunch of press though.

635
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,810
No, this is-- this is not
ordinary press, Bobby.
I know, I know.

00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,446
I'll-I'll do the big ones.
Great.
That is great.

Only, um--
hey, I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

638

When we do

I know. I know.
I'm telling the truth.

There's nothing wrong
with what I'm saying.
I know.

644
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,793
And people like that.
You need to be careful.

645
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,495
Some things you say,
they can be misinterpreted.

646
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,164
People get worried
when you talk like that.

647
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,832
What are you saying?
"People get worried."

648
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,467
Who? What people?
No one.

649
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,135
You're talking
about yourself.
No one.

do you wanna do?
Now, wait a second.

651
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,674
What did you mean,
"people begin to worry"?
What are you talking about?

652
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,809
Doesn't matter.
I think cavett
is a great idea.

653
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,945
Why do you keep
changing the subject?
I'm not changing--

654
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,548
I'm asking you a question.
You said people get worried.
What people?

655
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,686
Uh, Joan.

656
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:12,955
Joan? My sister?
How would you know that?
Did you talk to her?

657
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:14,890
I was in New York.

658
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,862
We, um-- we had
a cup of coffee.

659
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,299
You met with my sister?
Without telling me?
Wha-- why would you do that?

660
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:25,501
She called me.
What were you guys
talking about?

661
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:27,236
Were you
talking about me?

662
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,771
Well, I was looking out
for your interests.

663
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,408
That's my job.
Don't lawyer me, Paul.

664
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,043
I'm not trying to--
don't lawyer me.

665
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,145
You're talking
with my family
behind my back.

666
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:38,247
Did I ask you to do that?

667
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,915
What were you doing?
You're spying on me?

668
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,584
I was trying
to help you, Bobby.

669
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,719
I don't understand
why you thought
that was a good idea.

670
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,422
There are
a hundred more of you
just right behind you,

671
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,390
waiting in line
to be here.

672
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,064
Hey, pull over.
Um--

673
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,199
- stop the car.
- Wait a minute.
Bobby. Bobby.

674
00:53:57,201 --> 00:53:59,168
We're about
to get everything
you've ever wanted.

675
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,238
Stop the car!
Pull over!
Stop the car now!

676
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,320
Bishop, bishop six.

677
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,524
Uh, king to queen four.

678
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,160
Rook, rook five.

679
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,963
Pawn to king five.

680
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,780
So?

681
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,488
- He's back in his room.
- Is he okay?

682
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,990
He's in there listening
to those tapes of his.

683
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,732
Isn't that, uh,
some kind of god squad?

684
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:06,201
Those people know
as much about god as you do.

685
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,505
I'd have thought
you'd approve.

686
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,612
Should we try to get him
to see someone?
A psychiatrist?

687
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:19,114
Never gonna happen.

688
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:22,451
Concierge told me
he asked to have the TV
removed from his room

689
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,386
'cause he thinks
the Russians are watching him
through the screen.

690
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,022
Maybe they are.

691
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:34,396
He also believes
they're gonna try
to blow up his plane.

692
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,667
What good would a doctor do?

693
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,270
Give him a diagnosis.
Hmm.

694
00:55:41,272 --> 00:55:44,106
Uh, give him a pill.

695
00:55:44,108 --> 00:55:47,409
That would be like
pouring concrete
down a holy well.

He doesn't want
the Russians to know
what plane we're taking.

736
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,413
And I want the food

737
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,615
You got it, Bobby!
We have some issues.

738
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,751
Well, the plane
leaves in two hours.
With the traffic--

739
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:11,820
- and make sure

- Check!

There's never
enough oranges!
Uh-huh.

741
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:16,758

prepared in front of him.

742
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,760
Okay.

743
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:24,032
He also wants $46,875
in his bank account
before he plays.

744
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:25,868
He'll pick up the rest

Well, that's not
going to happen.

Yeah,

Who's traveling?

You're really serious
about all this?

751
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,852
They gotta give me what I want.

752
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,687
Mm-hmm.
And if they don't?

753
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,490
Well, we can play
in this hotel room.
I like it here.

754
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:51,126
Let me get this straight.
You're willing to throw all this
away for money and oranges?

755
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:53,529
That's right.
I don't need to play.
I know I'm the best.

756
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,397
I think you're scared.

757
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,700
And I think
you're overwhelmed.

758
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,802
Is that, like, um,
pop psychology?

759
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,774
Yeah.

760
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,046
You've got the passports,
right? You've got them?
Yeah.

761
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,683
I want my passport.

762
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:19,421
You-- you're not leaving
for a half an hour.
Yeah.

763
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,523
Yeah. Maybe I'll take
a later flight. Or not.

764
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:22,491
Okay.

765
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
Okay.

766
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,897
That's kind of funny,
seeing a priest get mad.

767
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,567
I'm getting on the phone
right now.

768
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:35,003
I'm gonna
make this work.
I don't mind either way.

769
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:36,438
I really
got nothing to prove.

770
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:17,546
Well, what's the issue, Bobby?
I don't know.
Something's not right.

771
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,758
We settled too low.
I oughta get 30%.

772
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,827
Bobby,
we agreed on 25%.

773
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,496
Well, it's 30 now.
We agreed.

774
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:37,432
Well, I changed
my mind, Paul.
I understand that.

775
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,968
But, Bobby,
you just can't change
your mind like that.

776
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,671
We're<i> here.</i>
We're at the airport.
What am I supposed to do?

777
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,406
I don't have to get
on the plane.
I don't know.

778
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,008
You're not gonna
get on the plane?
Now?

779
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:50,112
What is this, Paul?
I told you!
No photographers!

780
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,014
Move it!
Move out of the way!
All right, fine.

781
01:00:52,016 --> 01:00:54,783
Bobby!
Bobby!

782
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:09,464
Where to?
Just go! Drive!

783
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:19,174
<i>Another bizarre turn today in</i>
<i>the world chess championships</i>

784
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,477
<i>when Bobby fischer</i>
<i>failed to appear</i>
<i>for the opening ceremonies.</i>

785
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:25,781

<i>Boris spassky,</i>
<i>arrived in reykjavík today</i>

786

787
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,486
<i>Three-day adjudicator</i>
<i>Wolfgang schmid,</i>
<i>had this to say.</i>

788
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:34,723
I am honored, but confused.

789
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:38,293
I was always led to believe
that chess needed two people
for a game.

790
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:41,329
Unfortunately,
our American friends

791
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,665
have managed to lose
a famous Mr. Bobby fischer.

792
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:49,538
One hopes they are
not so careless
with their nuclear weapons.

793
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,375
Mr. tremblay,
is Bobby not showing affecting
Iceland relationships?

794
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,977
Is it true
he denied two million dollars
to come to reykjavík?

795
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:58,080
I love chess.
The world loves chess.

796
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:00,315
We are here
to celebrate chess.
Excuse us, please.

797
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,084
<i>Still no sign of Bobby fischer,</i>

798
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:05,187

804
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,268
Mama?
Yeah, baby.

805
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:22,871
There are men
on the lawn.

806
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,073
<i>Today the international</i>

Hello? Hello?

811
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,198
Bobby, is that you?

812
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,770
Yeah. I, uh--

813
01:02:54,772 --> 01:02:57,272
they promised me
no photographers and
a bunch of them showed up,

814
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,040
so I had to get
out of there.

815
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:02,244
<i> Where are you?</i>
I'm-I'm here.
I'm at home.

816
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:05,781
<i>I was going to the airport, and</i>
<i>they promised no photographers,</i>

817
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:08,316

so I had to get out of there.

818
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,652
I had to
show them,
Joan.

819
01:03:10,654 --> 01:03:13,088
They told me
no photographers.

820
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:17,125
They keep doing this to me,
everywhere I go,
all the time.

821
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,127
People keep
doing this to me.
<i> Yeah.</i>

822
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,328
It's not fair.

823
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,398
Bobby,
are you okay, huh?

824
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,567
<i>Well, you know that 727</i>
<i>that went down?</i>

825
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:29,237
You know, they said
the fuel tank exploded.

826
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:32,007
Yeah, well that seemed
kind of funny to me.
Right?

827
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,142
<i>You know, they don't</i>
<i>tell us everything.</i>

828
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,478
Yeah, no, they don't.
That's true.

829
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,481
<i>And the kgb,</i>
<i>they kill people.</i>
<i>They do.</i>

830
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:43,685
<i>Th-th-that's real.</i>
<i>They put poison on the tips of</i>
<i>their umbrellas, crazy things.</i>

831
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:46,521
<i>You understand?</i>
Yeah.

832
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,157
Baby, you stay there, okay?
I'm going to come over.

833
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,028
These people,
i wouldn't put
anything past them.

834
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,498
Who-who people, Bobby?
<i>The Russians.</i>
<i>You believe me.</i>

835
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,334
They would like it
if I dropped dead tonight.

836
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,671
You hear that?
Shh, shh, shh!

837
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:05,040
- <i> Do I hear what?</i>

838
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:08,810
Shh.

839
01:04:08,812 --> 01:04:10,879
I don't know. There's
a noise on the phone.

840
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,848
Do you hear it?
<i> No, I don't hear anything.</i>

841
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,617
Bobby?

842
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:25,360
We have a NATO base out there,
and I asked for the marines
to guard me.

843
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,063
They said<i> no</i> to me.
They said no, Joan.

844
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:31,800
With all the prestige
i am bringing
to this country.

845
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,401
I'm the most famous man
in the world.

846
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,837
Do you hear that?

847
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,576
<i>They put stuff</i>
<i>in my food to mess</i>
<i>with my mind, you know?</i>

848
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:45,180
I don't know.
<i> Bobby, you stay there.</i>
<i> I'm-I'm gonna come over.</i>

849
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:49,384
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen.
Joan, listen to me.

850
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,920
I'm trying to
tell you something.

851
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,756
I keep-- I keep
thinking about this.

852
01:04:54,758 --> 01:04:59,094
<i>I keep going over it</i>
<i>and over it</i>
<i>and over it in my mind.</i>

853
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:02,397
I can't figure out
what's next, Joan.

854
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,934
Do you know what I mean?
<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>

855
01:05:05,936 --> 01:05:08,637
Do you understand?
<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i> I understand, baby. Yeah.</i>

856
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:15,443
- Bobby--
- shh! Joan.

857
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,580
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
<i>Do you hear that?</i>

858
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,421
There's a noise.

859
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,424
Joan.

860
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:34,062
I'm gonna
get off the phone.

861
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:36,097
Bobby, you--

862
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,378
uh, who's there?

863
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,713
Hey, pal, you in there?

864
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:58,053
Hey, can I come in?
Got big news.
Yeah, what's that?

865
01:05:58,055 --> 01:06:01,656
You wanted more money?
I just got you
an extra 130k.

866
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:05,160
Some English chess nut
wants to see you play so bad.

867
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,664
Is the money real?
It's real. It's good.

868
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,599
It's secure.

869
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:14,002
May I use your phone?
Let folks know you're okay?

870
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,341
- Hey, who's that?
- That's, uh, security.

871
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:21,476
They've fixed it
for us at the airport.
We can go straight to the plane.

872
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,211
No press.

873
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,650
Yes. Hello?

874
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,152
I found him.

875
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,721
It's Henry kissinger.

876
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,092
Pretty amazing,
huh?

877
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,697
Hello?
<i>Dr. kissinger's on the line.</i>

878
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,168
<i>Hello. This is the worst</i>

882
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,751
Yeah. Yeah.
I, uh-- I decided to play.

883
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,724
<i>This is</i>
<i>the BBC world service.</i>

I don't know.

890
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,688
Uh, least there's
one reason to feel good
about America.

891
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:44,325
- A bit impolite.
- Fischer is to chess
like Ali is to boxing.

892
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:47,896
<i>He's tedious. He's arrogant.</i>
<i>He's inconsiderate.</i>

Yeah, well the Russians have
been telling lies about me
since I was a kid.

896
01:07:56,706 --> 01:08:00,375
- How do you like Iceland?
- Iceland?
Yeah, I'm happy to be here.

897
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:02,143
I feel like a viking,
ready to conquer.

898
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,763
Come in.
Take a look around.

899
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:23,932
Yeah.
There's good.

900
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:26,534
It's, uh,
five bedrooms.

901
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,370
Place even
has a sauna.

902
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,372
All right.
I'm gonna check out the rooms,
see which one I want.

903
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:33,308
Go for it.

904
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,415
Yeah.

905
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:49,023
Huh. Hey, uh,
what are you doing here?

906
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,563
I took a little time.

907
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,366
All right.

908
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,173
You want to work?
Want to analyze
some positions?

909
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:08,610
Nah, maybe later.
What's wrong? You sick?

910
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,478
I'm just taking a break.

911
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,183
Okay. I'll check up
on you in a few hours.

912
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:18,086
It's good to see you, Bobby.

913
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,257
Yeah, sure.

914
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,463
Couldn't stay away, huh?

915
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,765
Well, I get it.

916
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:33,768
Yankees are playing
in the series, you want
a seat in the dugout.

917
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,670
Can I get one of these?

918
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,544
Billion people
around the world
watching two guys play chess.

919
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,447
Nixon's put a TV
in the oval office.

920
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:48,116
Oh, yeah?
Mmm.

921
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:50,118
World war III
on a chess board.

922
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:54,389
We lost China.

923
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,092
We're losing
Vietnam.

924
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,197
We have to win this one.

925
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,583
This is abc's
<i>wide world of sports,</i>

926
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:24,686
bringing you live
coverage of the
world championship of chess.

927
01:10:24,688 --> 01:10:27,155
<i> Best of 24 games.</i>

928
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:30,525
<i>Each win is worth a point.</i>
<i>Each draw is half a point.</i>

929
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:34,495
It's the chess version
of a 15-round heavyweight
prize fight.

930
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:39,200
And the noise from the crowd
tells us that Boris spassky...

931
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:47,108
...in what will surely be
an historic confrontation.

932
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,794
Where is he?

933
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,768
If the press could please
take their seats,

934
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,771
we will now come together
for the drawing of the colors.

935
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,407
Mr. spassky?
Mr. fischer, choose.

936
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,514
Mr. fischer chose black.
Mr. spassky will begin.

937
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,498
So far, so good, yeah?

938
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,534
Mmm. They're playing
a variation on a nimzo.

939
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,536
A draw would be fine
for our side.

940
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:17,425
Is that bad?
No, no.
It simplifies the game.

941
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,751
Your cameras are making
too much noise.
It's distracting.

942
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:17,885
I'll be back.

943
01:14:17,887 --> 01:14:19,454
From
the cameras?

944
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:22,256
Yeah, they're going like--

945
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,361
come here.

946
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,069
Do you hear that?

947
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,839
It's just a camera.
Yeah. Well, you've got
to move it back.

948
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,107
What?
Move the camera back.

949
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,310
Move it back.
Move the camera back.

950
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:45,346
-You've got to get the audience
under control too.
-What's wrong with the audience?

951
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:47,415
They're making too much noise,
and you're not doing anything.

952
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:51,018
That's your job.
All right?
Do your job.

953
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,188
Mr. spassky's made his move.
It's good.

954
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,131
Yes, yes.
Herr schmid,
Mr. schmid,

955
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:07,168
he's trying to
upset my player.

956
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,037
You see,
the camera was making noise.
We just moved it back.

957
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:12,440
- He is upsetting my player.
- Yes, it's fine.

958
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,041
If you could just
take your seats, please.

959
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:16,377
Thank you.

960
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,413
Thank you.

961
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,670
You don't look well,
Robert James.

962
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,269
First game
goes to Boris spassky.

963
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,793
Bobby!
Bobby!

964
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:20,327
- Hold on a second!
- Don't yell at him.

965
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:21,862
I'm not yelling at him.
Bobby!

966
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,632
Bobby!

967
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:27,368
It's just one game.
One point.

968
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,236
You'll take
the next one.

969
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:32,406
Twelve and a half points
is-is a long match.

970
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:36,811
The reporters
will go after spassky.

971
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,746
We could slip out
another way.

972
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,750
You all right?

973
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:45,519
You hear that?

974
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,855
It's quiet in here.

975
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:51,492
Boris! Boris!

976
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,527
How did you feel?

977
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,997
How you doing, Bobby?

978
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:05,599
- I'm not
going to do it anymore.
- Do what?

979
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,735
Play with
all these distractions.
It's like a circus.

980
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,605
It's not
what we agreed to.

981
01:20:11,607 --> 01:20:14,108
You know, they've been
doing this to me for years.

982
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:16,243
Making me
all these promises.
They all turn out to be lies.

983
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:18,646
They've been doing it to me
since I was a kid.

984
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:21,849
You know,
i would get stuck in Europe
with huge hotel room bills

985
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:24,451
when I was 15 years old.

986
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:29,523
The federation would
raise money off of my back
and funnel it to reshevsky.

987
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,826
Another Jew, by the way.
I don't know
what I did to them.

988
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,962
And they're all out to screw me.
The Russians and the Jews--

989
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:36,664
they got their dirty
little fingerprints
all over everything.

990
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:39,767
What are we
talking about?
The Jews.

991
01:20:39,769 --> 01:20:41,635
Ah.

992
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,838
You made a stupid mistake,
and you got your ass
handed to you.

993
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,840
No. I am not going to submit
to their game.

994
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:48,275
- If you don't get
your head in the game--
- we're going to play my way!

995
01:20:48,277 --> 01:20:49,844
You're not just
gonna lose!
No audience, no distractions!

996
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:52,146
Humiliated in front
of billions of people!

997
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:56,450
You guys brought me here
under false pretenses,
and you're going to fix it!

998
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,887
This is how I play!

999
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,398
You know,
his mistake is that
he didn't see this bishop.

1000
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,570
Unless the rest of the games
are played without an audience
and without cameras,

1001
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:17,972
he isn't going to show up.

1002
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,911
He won't continue unless
the games are played
in the ping-pong room?

1003
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,013
That's the only place
that's quiet, he says.

1004
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,015
He also wants
a different board.

1005
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:32,086
Makes too much noise
when he puts the pieces down.
He prefers wood.

1006
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,190
It's like morphy.
It's destroying his brain.

1007
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:38,559
No, chess
isn't destroying him.
Why all the demands?

1008
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,028
It's like he wants them
to say no.

1009
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:43,697
I think he's afraid of
what's gonna happen if he loses.

1010
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,799
No. He's afraid of
what's going to happen
if he wins.

1011
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,782
If the press could
please take their seats.

1012
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:05,386
The match was scheduled
to begin at 5:00.

1013
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:07,588
We will now start the clock.

1014
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:40,254
Mr. fischer failed to show.

1015
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,057
Mr. spassky
wins by forfeit.

1016
01:22:43,059 --> 01:22:48,462
According to federation rules,
Mr. fischer has 24 hours

1017
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:51,465
to indicate in writing
that he wishes to continue,

1018
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,501
otherwise Mr. spassky
will be declared world champion.

1019
01:22:56,738 --> 01:22:59,239
<i>The match between Boris spassky</i>

1030
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:16,350
Bobby?

1031
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:20,320
I have messages from people
all over the world who
want you to open this door.

1032
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:25,926
Bobby?

1033
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,520
The president
of the United States
called three times.

1034
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:56,223
Three.

1035
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:58,959
Uh, well,
he's been trying to reach you.

1036
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:10,137
In Moscow,
brezhnev opened his only bottle
of 1868 Louis roederer,

1037
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:12,072
left over from the revolution.

1038
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:16,710
You know why?
Because he heard you quit.

1039
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:22,883
There are boys
your age in Vietnam
giving their lives right now

1040
01:25:22,885 --> 01:25:24,551
in the fight against communism,

1041
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:27,387
and all you have to do
is play a game of chess.

1042
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:42,035
Bobby, I've been arguing
on your behalf all night long!

1043
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,674
I-I've been
threatening them for you.

1044
01:25:47,676 --> 01:25:51,979
I have cajoled.
I have begged them!
Now I'm begging you.

1045
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:56,617
Please, please, please.

1046
01:25:56,619 --> 01:25:58,485
Go back in there and play.

1047
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,524
You're one of them,
aren't you?

1048
01:26:03,526 --> 01:26:05,726
- What?
- Who got to you?

1049
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:10,664
- Kgb? CIA?
- Are you serious?

Thank you.
Oh, hey.

1058
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:42,976
You won't believe it.
Spassky's agreed to play
in the ping-pong room.

1059
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:46,213
Yeah. Right.

1060
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:48,782
Wait.
Where are you going?

1061
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,019
Only one camera.

1062
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,255
It does not move.
It makes no sound.

1063

Good?

1064

really call you?
Game's starting.

1068
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,638
What's he doing?
I don't know.

1069
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:31,852
He's playing the benoni.
Black, two games down.
He thinks it's suicide.

1070
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:33,854
Is it suicide?
Yeah.

1071
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,176
- What's happening?
- He's exposing his king.

1072
01:32:30,178 --> 01:32:33,480
He's going to end up with
doubled-up pawns. He wants him
to take it with the bishop.

1073
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:16,022
Uh-huh.
Yeah, shit.

1074
01:33:54,996 --> 01:33:57,631
Oh, my god.

1075
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:08,308
He's threatening mate in one.
He's going to force
the exchange of these knights.

1076
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,580
He hates draws.

1077
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:18,485
- He takes him.

1078
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:28,928
Check.

1079
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,706

Mr. spassky.

An electrical engineer examined
the lighting fixture and made

- Bobby?
- Can I get you anything?

Oh, no, thanks.

Yeah, it's never
really dark here.

1129
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:52,952
You know, Bobby,

1130
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:57,990
the chess you've been playing
is really inspired.

1131
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:12,138
It's almost all, um,
theory and memorization.

1132
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:16,309
People think there are
all these options, but...

1133
01:45:18,945 --> 01:45:20,880
There's usually
one right move.

1134
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:24,550
Of course, in the end,
there's no place to go.

1135
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:35,214
<i>The United States is based</i>
<i>on lies. It's based on theft.</i>

1136
01:47:35,216 --> 01:47:38,884
<i>Look at all I've done</i>
<i>for the us. But now</i>
<i>I'm not useful anymore, you see?</i>

1137
01:47:38,886 --> 01:47:42,188
<i>The cold war is over, and now</i>
<i>they want to put me in prison.</i>

1138
01:47:44,825 --> 01:47:48,494
<i>I'm not sure, but if I know</i>
<i>the Jews in the us,</i>

1139
01:47:48,496 --> 01:47:52,298
<i>they may come at me</i>
<i>with some attack I don't expect.</i>

<i>are living in a dream world.</i>

1141
01:47:55,937 --> 01:47:58,504
It's not really paradoxical.

1142
01:47:58,506 --> 01:48:02,007
Chess is, uh, basically
a search for truth, right?

1143
01:48:02,009 --> 01:48:05,010
- Right.
- So I'm searching for the truth.
