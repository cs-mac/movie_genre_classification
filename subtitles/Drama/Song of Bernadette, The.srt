1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,885
I asked you will obey me!

2
00:00:07,022 --> 00:00:10,424
I will be indomittable!
I will sumbit you to me, instead!

3
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,618
You don't have the character of Prince!

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,425
Although you have 1,000 of strength
and 10,000 swords.

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:17,531
That's the reason why
you can't be the one.

6
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:20,431
Sir! What have you done to him!

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,333
Doctor, doctor!

8
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:25,530
Fever is getting worse.
You'll lose your conciousness.

9
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,235
- What's the matter with you?
- You're not a human!

10
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,242
Can't you see people dying here!

11
00:00:29,378 --> 00:00:31,745
This is the evidence that
Baekjae poisoned

12
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:33,440
a messengers with letter of the Emperor!

13
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,744
I will report this to the mainland!

14
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,751
We will find out the truth.
The truth!

15
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:42,052
I heard you're in difficult situation.

16
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,458
Bring me to castle Sabi!
I'll work things out for you!

17
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:48,566
When begging won't do any good,
you threaten me?

18
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:49,562
Bring him back.

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,565
And if things go wrong,
hide him safe.

20
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:57,163
Princess! I may not keep
the promise of being alive.

21
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,674
That woman?

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,677
Are you talking about Ms Jin?

23
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:02,972
Ms Jin?

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,213
This man is!

25
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,212
Take him to general's residence!

26
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:16,621
Jang! Aren't you Jang?
How can you...

27
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,318
Crown Prince!

28
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,828
I called him.

29
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:21,626
You?

30
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:26,326
Jang sent me a letter saying
he can work this out.

31
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,130
You can work it out?

32
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,940
Yes, he said he's notjoking.

33
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,138
He told me to solve this.

34
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:39,750
Yeah? What's your plan?

35
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:43,046
But you had have used me twice.

36
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,052
I just can't tell you for nothing.

37
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,251
What?

38
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:51,156
Reinstate me to Taehaksa first!

39
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:54,264
- How dare you!
- You damned man!

40
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:57,858
How dare you say it to him!
It's not worth to hear.

41
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,870
If you don't hear me,
you won't get what you want.

42
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:02,167
Jang!

43
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,367
You're begging me to kill you.

44
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,673
How could I not put my life here
and come this far!

45
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:09,677
You bastard!

46
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:12,512
You said you don't need to
keep weak person's promise.

47
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:15,314
My strategy is my strength.

48
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,822
Now I'm in control,
what will you do?

49
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,221
You can send me back to the Island,

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,521
But you won't hear my strategy.

51
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:25,425
You can slash me with a sword,

52
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,533
but you can't get out of this hell, general.

53
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,432
Lock him up, now!

54
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,233
Yes, sir!

55
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:39,246
- Take him!
- Yes, sir.

56
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,459
<i>Episode 25.</i>

57
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's go.

58
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:15,608
Jang!

59
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:21,220
- Crown Prince!
- Jang! Why are you doing this?

60
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:26,723
I know your anger towards Sun.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,726
This is a matter of Baekjae.

62
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,831
You shouldn't do this.

63
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:33,434
I also know what you mean.

64
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,934
But this is a matter with general.

65
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:38,633
Jang!

66
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:41,234
You must get your hand off this,

67
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,936
And entrust everything to general.

68
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,040
And please pretend you know
nothing about this.

69
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:56,456
I'll take care of everything
so please don't worry.

70
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,956
He is totally impudent.

71
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,662
Who does he think he's ordering to?

72
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:11,398
But if he has a strategy...

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,005
What about Dr. Mok?

74
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,809
How come Dr. Mok
didn't come with Jang?

75
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:20,014
Yes, why isn't he here?

76
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,310
He was very sick to come this far.

77
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:24,419
Something could have happened if he did.

78
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:27,522
So I had to treat him
in merchant's house in Sangdaepo.

79
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,922
- What?
- But soldiers are with him.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,120
As soon as he recovers,
bring him back!

81
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,925
Then, you knew how he sick was,

82
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,932
And you trusted Jang?

83
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:46,239
There isn't any, Jang has no plan.

84
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:50,937
He's just trying to buy some time
for Dr. Mok to recover.

85
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,448
He must have thought of
hiding doctor somewhere.

86
00:04:58,088 --> 00:05:00,148
Go and get Mok Rasoo!

87
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,953
Send a message now!

88
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,752
Yes, sir! Let's go!

89
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:16,103
He knows his life is on the line
if he has no plan.

90
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:19,003
Did he really do it for Mok Rasoo?

91
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:21,007
Jang would do it.

92
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:24,911
If he decide to save him,
he doesn't think of himself.

93
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,809
We'll find out if we bring Dr. Mok.

94
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:32,618
How are messengers doing?

95
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:36,524
They may be waiting orders
from mainland, no movement.

96
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,024
General! Use Goguryu!

97
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:47,338
Send a message to Goguryu to visit us.

98
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,737
They can't do anything
while Goguryu messengers are here.

99
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,241
But the relationship with Goguryu
is harder than Soo.

100
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,746
Prince is still working on it.

101
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:11,792
Surely it's that woman.

102
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:19,795
Without him
I can't smile, or be happy or sad.

103
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,803
Why should I do that?

104
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,009
Where are you going?

105
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,414
I need to do my business.

106
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:37,122
- Bring him back.
- Alright, come.

107
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:46,431
They guard him whole time.
What should I do?

108
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,825
Find a way!

109
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:10,612
Is the woman really merchant from Soo?

110
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,986
Yes, why do you ask?

111
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,688
Then, is she here as a guest?

112
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:20,495
No, she's traded with us for a few years.

113
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,601
This time she's settled in Baekjae.

114
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:25,898
This time?
How long ago?

115
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,801
Why do you ask so much?

116
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:32,203
No, she looks like someone I know.

117
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,507
Ok.

118
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:37,016
It looked like she went out,
is she home now?

119
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,813
No, she hasn't come home yet.

120
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:41,512
I have a favor to ask.

121
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,419
I can't walk around now,

122
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,925
So if she comes in,
arrange me to meet her.

123
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,924
Yes, no problem.

124
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:08,441
Have you been doing this
all night long?

125
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:09,447
What?

126
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:12,281
It's pity that you have to
do this for whole day.

127
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,286
We don't want to do this.

128
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,584
- But our duty is...
- You want to drink?

129
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,489
I have some liquor.

130
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:22,493
Liquor?
You got some left?

131
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:26,397
Tell me if you want!
It's Sogokju.

132
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,900
- Hansan Sogokju?
- Yes.

133
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,504
Brother! One shot won't hurt us.

134
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,610
The man inside looks he's sick.
What would happen to him?

135
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:37,304
Shall we just have a sip?

136
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,105
Let's do that!

137
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:41,508
Follow me.

138
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,335
Doctor! I'm sorry to say this.

139
00:09:07,476 --> 00:09:08,841
What is it?

140
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:10,946
Boat was arrived late night,

141
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:13,743
And a lot of merchants
who trade with us, came in.

142
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:18,947
So you need to empty here.

143
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:24,450
I'll find other place,
stay there for a while.

144
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,560
Where are soldiers
who guard me?

145
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:34,069
Yes, I told them to move you...

146
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:36,672
Jang did this, didn't he?

147
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,467
I'm not going with you.

148
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:41,770
Doctor!

149
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,880
If I escape now,
Jang will get into trouble,

150
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:47,882
also I can't return to Taehaksa!

151
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:50,180
- But, doctor!
- I'm not going.

152
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,787
Boss! We must hurry.

153
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,288
Damn it!
Escort the doctor!

154
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,189
- Why are you diong this?
- I promised Jang.

155
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,995
Don't do this! I'm not going!
I'm not going with you.

156
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,795
Don't do this! I can't go!

157
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,597
You shouldn't do this!
Stop it!

158
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,706
Don't do this!
Stop it!

159
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:11,138
I'm sorry, doctor!

160
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,642
Don't do this.
Jang will get in danger.

161
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:14,938
Doctor!

162
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,341
Run as fast as you can.

163
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,347
Until you are ordered,

164
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,040
Don't let him move.

165
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:21,550
- Yes, sir!
- Go!

166
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,975
Damn it!
We're in trouble.

167
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,480
Tell me where you hide him!

168
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,781
Hide him?
I just gave him medicine,

169
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,286
I haven't seen him since then.

170
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,683
And I just got home!

171
00:10:57,822 --> 00:11:01,087
Right, didn't you guys watch him?

172
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:04,195
What were you doing?

173
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,696
We're in deep trouble.

174
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,735
We shouldn't be doing this.
Let's look for him.

175
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,630
Yeah, let's hurry!

176
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,537
- What has happened?
- Boss! Boss!

177
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,642
Boss!

178
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,734
What happened?
Why are you alone without doctor?

179
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,940
He was caught on the street.

180
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,244
What?

181
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,553
What is it that you panic?

182
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,150
A friend of mine ask me
to look after a doctor from Taehaksa.

183
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,761
I couldn't keep his promise.

184
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,458
A doctor from Taehaksa?

185
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,258
Do you know him?

186
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,269
He wanted to see you
when you come back.

187
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:47,068
Why Dr. Mok want to see Ms Jin?

188
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,266
Did you say Dr. Mok Rasoo?

189
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,969
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

190
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,381
Then the person asked you to...

191
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,180
The friend from Chunwie of name is...

192
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,981
Jang!

193
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:07,588
Jang...

194
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:14,325
- Do you know him?
- Yes, I do.

195
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,025
How do you know him?

196
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,628
What kind of danger is he in?

197
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,540
I have to go to castle Sabi.

198
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:26,840
Soldiers are gathered to protect market,
I'm busy with that.

199
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,745
I'll go with you!

200
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,759
Come out!

201
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,576
Talk to him.

202
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:58,575
Talk about what?

203
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:00,078
Your strategy.

204
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:02,879
Do your part first!

205
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:09,586
Bring him in!

206
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,329
- Doctor!
- Jang!

207
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:21,425
You talk about power to test me.

208
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:22,833
It's funny.

209
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,344
If you have a strategy, tell me now!

210
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:31,935
Otherwise he won't be alive!

211
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,847
Doctor! I'm sorry.

212
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:40,149
Whatever happens to him,
I'll do this my way this time.

213
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,257
I didn't know you'd do this.

214
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,258
I've never known that
you would bring him by force.

215
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:47,760
Who is suffering from pain.

216
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:51,468
I'm truly disappointed.

217
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:55,468
Sir general!
I will change my proposal.

218
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:01,070
Reinstate of Taehaksa isn't enough now.

219
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:05,175
If you want to know my strategy,

220
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:07,681
You have to add the merit,
we achieved.

221
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:09,683
And confer me as an engineer

222
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:12,722
And confer Dr. Mok
as the master of Taehaksa!

223
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,423
This is my new proposal.

224
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,120
- Jang!
- Moreoever,

225
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:24,429
Our designation must be held first!

226
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:28,328
Otherwise I won't say a thing.

227
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:37,540
Either you kill me or not,
it's your call now, general!

228
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,964
You're doing this to save me
but you don't have a clue!

229
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:06,472
Jang!

230
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:11,611
Now my life and your life are on the line,

231
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:14,616
Don't I have to think anything?

232
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:16,617
How reckless are you!

233
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,926
Don't worry, doctor.
Trust me.

234
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:29,125
The woman you aparted in Silla.

235
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,629
Yeah?

236
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,731
How did you end up having farewell?

237
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:39,534
You couldn't win over the hierarchy?

238
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,549
No, she was very high class.

239
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,745
Finally she was caught by bodyguards.

240
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:53,950
But why do you ask now?

241
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:58,152
Have you met her again?

242
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:03,565
How can I meet her
when she is left in Silla?

243
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:08,874
If she's not here to see Jang,

244
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:12,103
why did she disguise herself
as a merchant?

245
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:24,220
So Jang told general
that he has an idea,

246
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,519
And he got into palace?

247
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,819
Yes.

248
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:33,129
He tried to burden it himself
and asked me to take care of him.

249
00:16:33,266 --> 00:16:37,433
And I was so loose, gosh.

250
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,734
You got to find out
something now, Seochung!

251
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:43,636
Yes?

252
00:16:48,783 --> 00:16:52,549
I thought Jang would listen to us
when Mok is brought here.

253
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,655
But he ended up rebelling.

254
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:02,260
It seems he really has the strategy.

255
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,965
What do you think?

256
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,166
I do not agree with it.

257
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,900
It happened anyway
and he's trying to buy some time.

258
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,705
- So, now is...
- General!

259
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,107
What do you want?

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,013
Messengers want to see you.

261
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:25,815
They do?

262
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,721
Message arrived from the nation!

263
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:38,332
To kill the messenger
with letter of Emperor

264
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:42,132
is insulting him
and he was very furious.

265
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:46,829
Considering the relation with Baekjae,
we won't cut off the trade

266
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:50,537
So hand over the Gubong mine to Soo!

267
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,343
- What?
- What did you say?

268
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,646
Or I was ordered to bring

269
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:59,253
general who
is responsible for this incident.

270
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:01,149
What?

271
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,453
We're leaving 3 days later!
Decide until morning of the day!

272
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,461
Whether you come with us
or hand in Gubong mine!

273
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,293
Gubong mine?

274
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:18,904
Is Soo confiscating the land of Baekjae?

275
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,805
This is total nonsense!

276
00:18:21,443 --> 00:18:24,004
This must not happen
in history of Baekjae.

277
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,409
But, if we don't accept it,

278
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,609
General will be taken
with all responsibility.

279
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:31,016
We wouldn't know what will happen.

280
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:34,020
I've seen plenty of this

281
00:18:34,157 --> 00:18:35,819
unfair diplomacy enough.

282
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:40,328
Then are you saying
we should hand over the gold mine?

283
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:44,026
Anyway we mustn't let general
to be taken away.

284
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:46,225
We have to stop it.

285
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:03,047
This is very intolerable.

286
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:05,747
It's not somewhere,
it's Gubong mine!

287
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,758
That's the biggest gold mine in Baekjae.

288
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,259
Right, this isn't a small issue.

289
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,854
It's the demand of big nation,
we can't do anything.

290
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,868
Are you saying we should
hand over the general?

291
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:21,369
That's why I'm discussing.

292
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:27,473
So when Prince asked to
do fabrics little slowly,

293
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,979
it would have never happened to us.

294
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:32,776
Why is it Sun's fault?

295
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:36,082
This is the problem
they disguised the death!

296
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,188
Isn't that diplomacy?

297
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:41,987
It is common that messenger
gets died on travelling far.

298
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:45,393
Every time it happens,
with bad mutual countries,

299
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,591
This kind of problem
always have caused.

300
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:52,091
That's why Prince always
took care of messengers first.

301
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:55,400
And negotiation comes afterward.

302
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,305
Plus, you could let Prince
to take care of it.

303
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:03,108
But you stole the body
and it got worse and worse.

304
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,512
What are you trying to say?

305
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,812
Are you saying general has to
be fully responsible?

306
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,854
It's not whose responsibility now.

307
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:13,153
To be confiscated the mine
is not only matter of loss,

308
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:15,453
It's directly related to the pride of Baekjae.

309
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:18,062
I cannot agree with that.

310
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:22,464
What? Are you saying
that we have to send the general?

311
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,966
All of you!
Do you think the same?

312
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,473
Other nations can't give up
their pride and benefit,

313
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:36,981
That's why they send a hostage.

314
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,277
What!

315
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,597
It's not too late.

316
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:58,503
You can tell them that
we'll support weapons to Goguryu.

317
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,301
We can go from there.

318
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:06,503
Prince Aja always have insisted it
with relation of Soo.

319
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:09,411
When we deal with the mainland,

320
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,351
it is much lucrative
for 3 of us to show unity.

321
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:17,752
But Baekjae and Goguryu
have been enemy for so long.

322
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,553
Prince Aja has been suggesting it,

323
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:22,060
And that's why most of nobles
don't support him.

324
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,358
That my brother can't do this.

325
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,366
But this isn't the ordinary situation.

326
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:30,959
Even if he does, Soo won't buy it.

327
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:32,766
We have to make them to.

328
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:35,467
Diplomacy is how much
you make them trust

329
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,578
and cheat each other.

330
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:49,684
Using Goguryu is the brilliant move.

331
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,794
Why do you hesitate?

332
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,693
Aren't you Baekjae person?

333
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:59,395
The relationship
between Baekjae and Goguryu

334
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,900
is much difficult than
Baekjae and Silla.

335
00:22:02,038 --> 00:22:05,600
If he makes a wrong move,
he will be on the edge.

336
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:09,107
But if we work things out as Jang said.

337
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,042
General's position will never be expanded.

338
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,344
Rather, it extens Prince's influence.

339
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:18,249
I know enemies are all over us.

340
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:35,666
You can't get what you want
without listening to my plan.

341
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,967
How could I not put my life here
and come this far!

342
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,974
You said you don't need to
keep weak person's promise.

343
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,273
My strategy is my strength.

344
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,973
Now I'm in control,
what will you do?

345
00:22:46,117 --> 00:22:47,776
You can slash me with a sword,

346
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:50,886
but you can't get out of
this hell, general.

347
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:55,685
Hand over the Gubong mine

348
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:58,295
Or the general has to be taken to Soo.

349
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,396
Gubong mine!

350
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,294
Now, general is in the corner.

351
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,195
Then he can go to Soo.

352
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:09,101
Do you think you'll safe after all?

353
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,231
Even if I'm not
I gotta win this time.

354
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:14,241
Unless you keep your promise fisn't,

355
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,041
I won't say a thing from my mouth.

356
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:19,742
How can't you distinguish
national and personal matter!

357
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:21,249
I will do it tomorrow!

358
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:31,561
Tomorrow, I will appoint

359
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:34,063
you and Mok's designation!

360
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:41,671
Tomorrow?
Really?

361
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:43,967
So tonight,

362
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:45,575
Open the board of doctor officially.

363
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,170
Do you really trust
Jang has the strategy?

364
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,474
Yes.

365
00:23:50,615 --> 00:23:55,279
I thought he did it to save Mok
in the first place.

366
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:59,089
But I put Mok's life on the line
but he wasn't moved.

367
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:03,585
He won't put his life on risk
to just piss me off.

368
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,792
He has the strong will to survive.

369
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:11,426
And that's why he made it
through the steeple.

370
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:17,642
It was the same eyes
when he had at the fire steeple.

371
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:27,250
Maybe, maybe he used that?

372
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:31,153
Here you are.

373
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:33,352
Where have you been?

374
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:35,859
I sent Goosan to Silla.

375
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,157
Why?

376
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:40,367
I can't hide to live.

377
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,659
I got to bring my assets which I can.

378
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:47,462
Yes, I have an idea of myself.

379
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:52,376
Ok, by the way didn't
general's case solve yet?

380
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:56,378
Finally, he accepted Jang's proposal,

381
00:24:56,516 --> 00:24:59,485
Dr. Mok will be designated
as the master tomorrow.

382
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:00,779
What?

383
00:25:03,924 --> 00:25:06,392
Doesn't Dr. Wooyoung designate
as the master?

384
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:09,689
I thought it was,
but what's this designation?

385
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:13,427
Right. This is too sudden.

386
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,831
People are in panic
because of the messengers.

387
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:17,529
I have no idea what is happening.

388
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:20,832
I thought Jang is here,
but he's not around.

389
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,340
What happened?

390
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:26,435
I don't know, I saw him.
Maybe not.

391
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,947
That's surely I might not saw...

392
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:34,254
- How, how!
- What? What?

393
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:37,049
Who is that? Look!

394
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,056
It's Jang! It's Jang!

395
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,960
Jang!

396
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:58,872
Attention!

397
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:02,081
Neverthless, Dr. Mok Rasoo
and engineer Jang,

398
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:05,779
Were demoted regarding
their behavior in Silla,

399
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:09,189
They invented loom device
to produce pattern fabric.

400
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,623
They achieved high honor of Baekjae!

401
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,025
Therefore I absolved their sin from Silla!

402
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:17,627
Engineer trainer Jang to engineer!

403
00:26:17,767 --> 00:26:20,634
Dr. Mok Rasoo is to
the master of Taehaksa,

404
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,236
The board of doctor has
decided yesterday!

405
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,148
Dr. Mok and engineer Jang
stand in front of Prince!

406
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,058
Come forward, Dr. Mok.

407
00:26:57,307 --> 00:27:02,768
The Imperial of Baekjae
achknowledge your merit

408
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:06,781
so I designate you
as the master of Taehaksa.

409
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:23,433
Come forward, engineer Jang.

410
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:34,839
The Imperial of Baekjae
achknowledge your merit

411
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:40,440
so I designate you
as the engineer of Taehaksa.

412
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,666
- Jang!
- Jang!

413
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,467
What happened?
How did this happen?

414
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:04,768
I heard you were in the palace
but you weren't around.

415
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:07,673
I was so worried.

416
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,206
Jang!

417
00:28:14,754 --> 00:28:18,314
Now I kept your promise,
let's go to general!

418
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:20,424
Time hasn't come yet.

419
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,527
Also, I haven't seen
my colleagues for long time,

420
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:24,219
So I have to enjoy myself.

421
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:27,231
And I need to be congratulated
for becoming an engineer.

422
00:28:27,366 --> 00:28:29,925
Please wait, let's go!

423
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:42,841
- Sir, please drink a lot.
- Alright, alright.

424
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,752
How did this happen?
And what's that promise?

425
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:50,447
It's nothing.
How have you been?

426
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:54,048
Haneuljae people are divided
in half because of Giroo.

427
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:57,651
And general got punished
from heaven so he's in trouble.

428
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,665
He tried to prove the cause of death,

429
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,962
Giroo and Dr. Wooyoung tried their best,

430
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:05,162
They got general in deep trouble.

431
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:09,162
Let's talk this thing later.

432
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:12,176
We just need to drink it.

433
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,973
Of course, you don't know
how much I wanted to drink it.

434
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:17,084
I'm gonna drink until I get druken.

435
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,482
Yeah, that's good to hear.

436
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,887
Since you're back from hell,
now you're a real man.

437
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:34,793
<i>At the east river's</i>

438
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:40,305
<i>sleeping bird</i>

439
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:47,210
<i>sun is shined</i>

440
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:58,818
Dad, it doesn't really suit on this.

441
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:01,918
- Let's drink.
- You give it a try.

442
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,027
There you are.

443
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:09,336
What if a spark gets to us?

444
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:12,064
A spark?
We've done nothing wrong.

445
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:15,768
But I can't see them in their eyes.

446
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:18,472
I feel so much better.

447
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:20,980
I felt bad that
we've done it to them

448
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:23,674
But now Jang's an engineer
and doctor is the master.

449
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,285
So I'm relieved.

450
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:27,080
It's better to think that way.

451
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,281
But how in the world
could happen like this?

452
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:31,791
Does anyone know why?

453
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,486
I don't know well.

454
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,994
But Giroo said Jang can fix

455
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,689
this messenger incident.

456
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:39,890
That incident?
How?

457
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:41,503
It won't be easy...

458
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:45,006
So no one knows
how this end up.

459
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:48,907
Did you call us?

460
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:51,104
You two need to go
somewhere urgently.

461
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:54,116
- Just two of us?
- Yes.

462
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,512
Where to?

463
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:57,415
You need to go to Wolnagun.

464
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:00,216
- To Wolnagun?
- That's too far.

465
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:02,321
What do you want?

466
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:06,121
You probably have seen
the woman in Jingak temple.

467
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:07,820
The woman in Jingak temple?

468
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,364
The woman who was
in love with Jang?

469
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,765
Yes, I think I saw her in Wolnagun.

470
00:31:13,903 --> 00:31:16,667
- Huh?
- She's in Baekjae?

471
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:17,863
It seems like it.

472
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:19,871
To look for Jang?

473
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,771
Shouldn't she be in castle Sabi, then?

474
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:24,676
That's what I thought.

475
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:27,374
If she's looking for Jang,
she must be in castle Sabi.

476
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:30,179
She's staying with
merchant in Wolnagun,

477
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,482
And pretending as a merchant from Soo.

478
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,285
A merchant from Soo?

479
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:41,190
Find out whether
she's right and if so

480
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,892
why she is doing that for.

481
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,593
- Find out in detail.
- Yes.

482
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,601
And this is...

483
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:51,799
Jang must not know this.
And he won't have time to.

484
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:55,105
Right, we all know who caused this.

485
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:01,416
- Let's go.
- We'd get going now.

486
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,155
How did this happen?

487
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,765
Jang said that he can
work things out with messengers.

488
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,458
He has a plan?

489
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,070
Well, I wouldn't know.

490
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,673
Surely, he must have something.

491
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,778
Would he do this without any plan?

492
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,473
- Yeah?
- But why?

493
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,577
Write that and send it
to him unanimously.

494
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,986
Would it help him?

495
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:42,983
If we're thinking the same thing,
it'll help.

496
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,596
It'll strengthen him.

497
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,795
Finally, general accepted
duke Seodong's proposal,

498
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,600
They have finished their designations.

499
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,101
Would he really have the plan?

500
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:03,012
If he doesn't,
he's in serious danger.

501
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,148
Have you stretched that thing?

502
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,049
Yes, yes.
It's very nicely done.

503
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:21,757
- I have a favor.
- Huh?

504
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,270
Whether it's Taehaksa,
palace or castle Sabi,

505
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,963
Do I have good connections?

506
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:29,769
Well, I'm trying to show off

507
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,471
But out of all people,
I have good connection.

508
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,671
- I know it bothers you...
- Alright.

509
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:39,878
Through your favor,
I'll show you my good connections.

510
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,785
I think I should create a broadband myself.

511
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,691
Then, find out one thing for me.

512
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,487
What?

513
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,294
- Are you engineer Jang?
- Yes, I am.

514
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,797
Someone wanted to deliver this.

515
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,510
Who sent you this?

516
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,640
You know, a guy...

517
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:18,553
I don't think I need to ask you a favor.

518
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:21,960
What? Are you kidding me?

519
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,764
What's that letter?

520
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:29,763
Have a seat.

521
00:34:31,706 --> 00:34:34,574
Tell me what is your plan.

522
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:37,773
You don't have one?

523
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:42,977
Then get out of Baekjae now.

524
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:45,177
If you were trying to save my life,

525
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:46,877
You don't have to do this.

526
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:52,886
I'll take all responsibilities,
escape now.

527
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:55,792
There is! I have a plan.

528
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:59,703
The moment general designated
you as the master!

529
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:03,794
I got a plan.
So don't worry too much.

530
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,205
I don't know whether he'll do it
but I have a plan.

531
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,350
Is Jang still like that?

532
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:27,154
Yes, he's been drinking
since afternoon.

533
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:38,467
What is it? At this night!

534
00:35:38,608 --> 00:35:41,772
Yes, I came to inspect your places.

535
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,469
Don't you have any uncomfortable things?

536
00:35:43,612 --> 00:35:47,277
No, everything is fine!

537
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,783
By the way
you haven't decided yet?

538
00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:54,589
Tomorrow at 8 o'clock
the boat departs.

539
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,598
We're not going with empty hands.

540
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,896
Whether we take general
to drown in Wang's sorrow,

541
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:10,234
or take the mine.
We have to follow Emperor's decision.

542
00:36:10,374 --> 00:36:12,842
Would the mine be

543
00:36:12,978 --> 00:36:16,641
more important than general?

544
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:21,049
It's 8 o'clock, decide!

545
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:28,457
Bring Jang now.

546
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:29,753
Yes!

547
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:35,365
Jang is missing.
He's not there.

548
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,369
What? Has he ran away?

549
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,562
Yes!

550
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:40,965
Find him now!

551
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:29,748
Bastard!

552
00:37:36,395 --> 00:37:37,760
What is it?

553
00:37:38,396 --> 00:37:40,558
How dare you!

554
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:13,724
I have to decide in between two
by tomorrow morning.

555
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,831
And I've born your reckless behavior

556
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:23,944
and I've done what you had asked for.

557
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,240
Tell me now.

558
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:34,045
What's your plan?

559
00:38:38,391 --> 00:38:39,949
I said tell me now!

560
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:47,765
I already taught you my strategy!

561
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:51,663
- What?
- Definitely, I taught you.

562
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,169
My life was on the line
but I came back to Taehaksa

563
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:03,977
And became an engineer
and doctor became the master.

564
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,985
How could this happen?

565
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:13,284
Nothing is something?

566
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:17,999
The strategy which nothing can be
seen as something!

567
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:21,295
You have no plan!

568
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:26,100
Yes, but you believed
I have something,

569
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:28,504
and I acquired what I needed.

570
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:33,102
So now I can confront you like this.

571
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:38,016
The best strategy that

572
00:39:38,154 --> 00:39:40,519
weak one can use to strong one.

573
00:39:42,357 --> 00:39:46,226
But there is only one condition on this.

574
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:51,923
One is capacity and courage.

575
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,632
Like you were fooled by me,

576
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:58,333
You shouldn't be shaken
in any circumstances.

577
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:01,136
I mean, they have to trust you.

578
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,242
In order to do that,
you need capacity to bet your life on it!

579
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,487
That's why I waited for the moment

580
00:40:13,623 --> 00:40:15,888
you were driven to the edge.

581
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:20,785
Because capacity that
I and Soo messengers have,

582
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,592
you don't have it, general.

583
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:29,702
No Emperor sends messengers
to cut off the relation.

584
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,307
Moreover, according to my information,

585
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:37,414
A ship was departed
but it never returned.

586
00:40:37,548 --> 00:40:40,415
It means they sent a man to their country.

587
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,020
But he never came back here.

588
00:40:43,155 --> 00:40:46,714
If you're a coward,
you can't use this strategy.

589
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,626
I taught you my strategy.

590
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:54,823
Now it's all up to you.

591
00:41:42,048 --> 00:41:44,710
If you and I are thinking
the same thing,

592
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,612
it will help you.

593
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:52,823
A ship was sent to Soo but it didn't return.

594
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:56,326
They have never discussed
anything with the Emperor.

595
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,126
Believe in yourself.

596
00:42:01,066 --> 00:42:05,936
Who could it be?
Who would send this letter?

597
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:18,779
I read his thought
and still I couldn't move general,

598
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,684
His will splited him and me?

599
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,205
You are dead meats.

600
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,610
- Do you want to live?
- Yes.

601
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:51,912
There is a way.
Put fire on the fire steeple.

602
00:42:52,052 --> 00:42:54,020
Just kill me.

603
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,622
I don't want no arrows in my body.

604
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:57,918
Let's do this!

605
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:03,021
I'll do it, I'll do this!

606
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:09,625
If there's no plan,
let it drive into the corner.

607
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:12,567
Rat can bite cat.

608
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,871
What will you do?

609
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:20,373
Now it's time.
Tell us now!

610
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,175
- Listen up!
- Yes, sir!

611
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:28,375
Lock up all messengers
except Sir Gook.

612
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:38,792
And execute them tomorrow 8 o'clock.

613
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,900
- Proceed immediately!
- Yes.

614
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,297
General! What are you doing!

615
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:57,811
It happened anyhow,
I can't hand over the mine

616
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,813
and I'm not going either.

617
00:44:59,949 --> 00:45:01,713
I'll break relation with Soo!

618
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,691
I needed a man to report
this situation to Soo,

619
00:45:10,895 --> 00:45:12,157
so I leave you out.

620
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:17,166
Go to your country
and report this, Sir Gook!

621
00:45:19,404 --> 00:45:21,065
- Take them!
- Yes, sir!

622
00:45:21,907 --> 00:45:23,065
This way.

623
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:30,078
Let go, let go!
You bastards!

624
00:46:06,152 --> 00:46:07,619
How did this happen?

625
00:46:07,753 --> 00:46:09,722
General clarified to break the relation,

626
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,349
And lock up all messengers from Soo.

627
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:13,547
What?

628
00:46:13,691 --> 00:46:17,059
It'll lead to a war.

629
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:21,060
I trusted your confidence,

630
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:23,761
How did you do
this reckless decision?

631
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:28,261
Please trust me, lord!
It will work outjust fine.

632
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,375
How can you say
that with this situation?

633
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:33,479
Prince got to wrap it up queitly now.

634
00:46:33,615 --> 00:46:37,675
I told you to do this
and I'll take all responsibilities.

635
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:39,478
Let me handle it to the end.

636
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:44,086
Are you confident?

637
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:45,782
I will do it.

638
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,295
Lord! Lord!

639
00:46:53,833 --> 00:46:55,893
I must find out one thing.

640
00:46:56,036 --> 00:46:58,698
As general clarified the break of relation,

641
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:00,808
is this the decision of Baekjae Imperial?

642
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:02,807
Is this true?

643
00:47:03,944 --> 00:47:06,207
Poisoning Wang wasn't enough

644
00:47:06,346 --> 00:47:07,903
and you're doing this unreasonable act,

645
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:10,448
Is this the decision of Baekjae Imperial!

646
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:12,553
How dare you!

647
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:15,748
Where do you think
you're misbehaving?

648
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,353
Lord! I will execute Sir Gook now!

649
00:47:20,495 --> 00:47:23,157
Please allow me to execute him!

650
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:31,362
I will send his neck
to the Emperor of Soo,

651
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:33,769
And show my mean.

652
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,776
Please allow me to execute him!

653
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:05,501
Sir Gook!

654
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:13,345
They are messengers of the mainland.
Would it be ok?

655
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:16,940
This is reckless.
Please settle it now.

656
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:19,850
After listening to Jang
who made a troble,

657
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:23,354
and doing this isn't possible.

658
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:26,256
It's not very reliable.

659
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:29,365
No, this will work.

660
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,865
I also haven't used that strategy,

661
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,663
but it will work on bigger nation.

662
00:48:35,805 --> 00:48:39,970
And he's not the Emperor of Soo,
he's just a messenger.

663
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:44,776
It doesn't make sense that
we have to watch them.

664
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:46,277
Because they have stronger nation.

665
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,685
I believe in Jang's strategy.

666
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:00,295
What are messengers doing now?

667
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,594
They don't think they would be executed.

668
00:49:04,735 --> 00:49:06,202
They don't think so?

669
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,701
I'm going to execute them
tomorrow morning, be prepared.

670
00:49:13,343 --> 00:49:16,906
Are you really going to kill them?

671
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:20,814
Yes, I must.
Success of this strategy

672
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,510
Depends on putting every risk I have.

673
00:49:30,361 --> 00:49:31,828
This is reckless.

674
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:34,830
What if it doesn't work?
What if you fail?

675
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:37,832
Your life is for sure,
doctor's life is in your hand.

676
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,739
The book you told me to read,
there is a story.

677
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:44,335
A man was announced
to be a death row.

678
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:48,242
On the execution day,
he requested weird proposal.

679
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,947
If King spares him one year,

680
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:55,143
he will teach how to fly to
King's dearest horse.

681
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:57,756
So King allowed his proposal.

682
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:00,858
His cell mate asked him
why he did such thing.

683
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:03,755
But his answer was like this.

684
00:50:04,396 --> 00:50:06,762
Who would know
what would happen 1 year later?

685
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:10,732
King might die or
I might die within a year.

686
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:13,098
Or horse maybe the one.

687
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,807
And who knows?

688
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:21,709
Horse can really fly 1 year later!

689
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:43,325
Do you think Baekjae
will be safe after this!

690
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:46,131
I didn't want to come this far either!

691
00:50:47,474 --> 00:50:51,241
But, as you said it's my fault,

692
00:50:51,378 --> 00:50:55,643
or as I insist it's your obstinacy.
It happened anyway.

693
00:50:57,984 --> 00:51:00,248
Handing over the mine

694
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:02,651
is humliation of Baekjae,

695
00:51:02,789 --> 00:51:04,847
It cannot be accepted anyhow.

696
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:10,395
And I won't go as a hostage, either.

697
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:15,092
So we have to break
the relation with Soo.

698
00:51:15,235 --> 00:51:17,702
If you do that to us,
it's a war!

699
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:21,398
Fortunately we don't share
the border with Soo.

700
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:27,809
You'd recruit forces
and request more units to Goguryu.

701
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:32,510
The sign to break the relation,

702
00:51:32,653 --> 00:51:34,313
You would know it well!

703
00:51:35,656 --> 00:51:39,319
I don't have any personal grudge to you.

704
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,229
But it happened in between
affair of our nations.

705
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:45,729
Please forgive me!

706
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:49,129
Proceed!

707
00:51:50,973 --> 00:51:52,939
- Proceed.
- Yes, sir.

708
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:55,234
- Proceed!
- Yes, sir!

709
00:51:59,581 --> 00:52:02,050
What are you doing?
Execute them now!

710
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:04,652
Wait! Wait a minute!

711
00:52:04,786 --> 00:52:07,758
I'm sorry. It's too late.

712
00:52:07,888 --> 00:52:09,447
- Soldiers!
- Yes, sir!

713
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:14,489
Wait! Demanding gold mine was
too much, I will withdraw it!

714
00:52:14,629 --> 00:52:17,690
Didn't you say you already
sent a message to your country!

715
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:19,300
- Execute them!
- Wait!

716
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:23,201
I'll confess!
I lied to you!

717
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,504
Honestly, my Imperial doesn't know
anything about his death.

718
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:33,306
Then sending a message
to the mainland is a lie?

719
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:38,112
That's right. Break the relation,
gold mine and recall general

720
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:39,720
These are not from the mainland!

721
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:43,519
What? How can you devise it
as a messenger?

722
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,119
What else can we exchange your gold
if not papers or fabrics?

723
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:52,027
We're in trouble if we go back.

724
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,930
Well, it's too late!

725
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:57,039
You're saying this
to save your life now.

726
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,232
But if you go back, you will tell

727
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,842
General poisoned him.

728
00:53:01,476 --> 00:53:02,944
What are you waiting!
Execute them now!

729
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:05,138
- Yes, sir!
- No! Please wait.

730
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,843
It will never, never happen!

731
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,578
Are you saying
you will hide the poisoning?

732
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,181
It's not that.
Sir Wang had a heart disease.

733
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:20,695
Emperor knows this,
so it wont' be a problem.

734
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,298
- What?
- And this,

735
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,696
I'll take care of it
and won't mention to anyone.

736
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,793
Please be mercy and release us!

737
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:32,804
Anyway I was ordered to maintain

738
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,808
The annual amount of gold.

739
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:39,905
Please I'm asking you to
maintain my decency.

740
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,112
And it won't be a problem.

741
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,416
I will swear to heaven.

742
00:53:45,557 --> 00:53:48,821
Sir general!
Pleaes trust my words.

743
00:53:59,571 --> 00:54:04,234
General!
We all work to benefit our countries.

744
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,935
Let's trust them and negotiate.

745
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,582
Yes! Trust me!

746
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,285
Alright! I want you to resume,

747
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,291
the disclosed Baekjae place in Gyerim.

748
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:26,989
If you do that, I will guarantee
the same amount of gold.

749
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:32,195
I'll do that.
I can talk about that!

750
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:34,598
Remove it!

751
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:40,609
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, general.

752
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:43,806
Thank you, thank you.

753
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,725
How can you be working now?

754
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,030
You and doctor's life are on the line.

755
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:07,138
How can you be so calmed?

756
00:55:09,174 --> 00:55:11,473
I'm nervous this time.

757
00:55:12,012 --> 00:55:16,574
Either you die this time, Jang

758
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,980
Or my heart will explode.

759
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:26,590
Prince is coming.

760
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:32,796
Jang! You pulled it off.
You made it!

761
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,493
Prince is coming with smile.

762
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:46,410
Aren't you curious?
You weren't waiting for it.

763
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:50,108
Honestly, I was too nervous
and afraid to go out and wait.

764
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:55,215
That's tedious for you to say.

765
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:05,930
Well done! Your capacity
resolved a difficult issue.

766
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:14,468
Lord! I told him not to do
that next time.

767
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,079
Is that true?
Is it true?

768
00:56:26,221 --> 00:56:29,884
Yes, I went to palace to submit permit.

769
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:31,583
I heard it myself.

770
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:33,491
Jang's strategy worked just fine.

771
00:56:34,128 --> 00:56:36,688
Yes, yes...

772
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,598
What's your relationship with Jang?

773
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:46,199
It's more than words can express.

774
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:50,309
Why don't you meet him
and doing this behind him?

775
00:56:52,248 --> 00:56:55,810
Yes, why don't you meet him now?

776
00:56:58,254 --> 00:57:00,118
Yes, lady!

777
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:04,918
Yes, lady!

778
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:09,725
Send my letter again.

779
00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:10,960
Yes!

780
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:24,777
What is it?

781
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:28,179
Is engineer Jang in there?

782
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:33,084
He's not here, what is it?
I'll deliver your message.

783
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:39,786
No, I'll come back.

784
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:48,203
I hired him!

785
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:52,102
You people made the incident
he was seeing Silla woman,

786
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:56,805
and insult his royalty and my insight.

787
00:57:56,948 --> 00:58:01,010
He is the one who solved
a difficult issue with messengers!

788
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:05,419
So, lord! The reason
he had to run away in Silla,

789
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:09,515
I think you should conceal it for him.

790
00:58:11,395 --> 00:58:13,260
I think the same.

791
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,864
It is the vigrous youth that
anyone could have done!

792
00:58:19,102 --> 00:58:21,469
If you can't allow that much,

793
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:24,972
And misinterpret his
ability and royalty.

794
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:27,874
How can we hire intelligent man?

795
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:34,176
I'll absolve your crime,

796
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:37,580
reborn as royal servant of Baekjae!

797
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,985
Yes, lord!

798
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:41,990
Although things turned out fine,

799
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,889
if it didn't work out,

800
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,191
think about how much

801
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:49,994
We had to be humilated from Soo.

802
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:55,197
So general must reflect it deeply

803
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:02,009
And do not engage any affairs
except military police!

804
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,910
Yes, lord.

805
00:59:40,187 --> 00:59:43,351
Daringly, you told me
to submit me.

806
00:59:45,592 --> 00:59:47,455
He totally got me.

807
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,859
It's just beginning.

808
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:06,773
I should have listened to your advice.

809
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:10,746
Yes, Jang defeated you mentally.

810
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,314
But don't worry about it too much.

811
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:17,421
He gets things done
with reckless and capacity.

812
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:20,926
But he causes many trouble
because of it.

813
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,636
I used to be like him.

814
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:33,337
But I should change.

815
01:00:34,176 --> 01:00:37,735
To be your enemy,
I should have learnt

816
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,038
your precision and moderation.

817
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:43,649
Further, your cruelty.

818
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:47,245
Yes, I hope you do.

819
01:00:48,088 --> 01:00:50,250
I hope our fight won't be bored.

820
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:57,463
Prince wants to see you.

821
01:00:58,101 --> 01:00:59,261
Yes.

822
01:01:09,812 --> 01:01:11,109
What's the matter?
Why are you here and

823
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:12,906
doing nothing?

824
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:14,915
That's...

825
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,814
What's the business with Jang?
Tell me now.

826
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,214
That's...

827
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:27,518
- Did you come to see me?
- Yes, I have things to ask you.

828
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:29,221
Alright, follow me.

829
01:01:36,873 --> 01:01:40,329
Did the same person send you again?

830
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:42,443
- Yes.
- What is it?

831
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:45,241
I have to deliver it only to you.

832
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,046
Ok, thanks.

833
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,450
It's like you as I expected.

834
01:01:56,593 --> 01:01:59,859
When you shoot,
the world is shoot!
