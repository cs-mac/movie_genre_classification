1
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Of course, women have always
been a vital link...

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,800
in the lifeline that supplies
combat units.

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,040
The last few years have brought
real progress...

4
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,400
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service.

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,400
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses...

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,480
for all its male recruits,
demonstrating even more progress-

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mr. Hayes.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,520
If a cannibal used a knife and fork,
would you call that progress too?

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,480
Well, perhaps, if I could just finish,
Madame Chairman, your questions-

10
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,160
Oh, I'm just an old dame
without much time left,

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,960
so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here.

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude...

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,160
toward women in the military.

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,720
Case in point: the Lark Report.

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Uh, Madame Chairman, this is
an internal document of the U.S. Navy.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,000
The Navy's analysis of that F-14 crash
at Coronado last year.

17
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Female aviator,
it just so happens.

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,000
You were party to this report.
Am I right?

19
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,920
I am really not prepared
to go into an in-depth-

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,560
If you are vying for the office
of the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Hayes,

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,600
I'd like to think
you were prepared for anything.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Especially if you're lookin'
for my confirmation.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm struck by the ill-spirited
tenor of your report:

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
degrading remarks
by other aviators,

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,440
There's even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,200
These are not
unrelated circumstances.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,880
In my seven years
on this committee,

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,240
I have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this, never.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
I'm deeply disturbed
by this report, Mr. Hayes.

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the Navy,

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
but your future as well.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing...

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,480
as a pulpit
for women's rights?

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,360
Look, nearly one-quarter of
all jobs in the U.S. military...

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,520
are still to this day off-limits
to women, and that has gotta change!

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,360
What about those that say women aren't suited
for all jobs, they're physically weaker?

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,280
How strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger?

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,360
That was quick.
Yeah, she did great.

40
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
Are you kidding?
She's always great.

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Private meeting.
That's what we want.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,520
Are you worried about the next round
of base closures, Senator?

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,480
- As long as it doesn't affect me.
- Defense boys already called.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,400
They want
a private meeting with you.

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
I'll act surprised.

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Senator, this is a contingency program
for 100 percent integration.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,200
If female candidates measure up
in a series of test cases,

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,000
the D.O.D. will support full
integration within three year's time.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,880
We get our man. You get
your gender-blind Navy, Senator.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,160
Surely you're not gonna
balk at that.

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,360
I have to pick
the test cases.

52
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,600
The Navy'll want approval
over the women.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,360
- So I'll approve their approval.
- Come on, Senator.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,880
Let's concentrate on the steak
and not the peas.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
If women measure up to the men, they've
got the job. That's what's on the table.

56
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,160
- Well, Doug?
- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
So, what program?

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,720
I'd go C.R.T.
Combined Reconnaissance Team.

60
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,000
SEALS.
Sixty percent dropout rate.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,520
No woman's gonna last a week.
I don't care who she is.

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,800
Then I suggest
we start there.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,840
Good work.

64
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,960
Hostile activity.
Mined area.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I say again:
hostile activity, mined area.

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,320
Maintaining holding action.

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,240
Carrying one wounded.

68
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Extracting to new location
secondary P.Z. Over.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,440
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

70
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,360
Negative
on secondary rendezvous.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Strongly suggest new location.
Over.

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,240
Stand by, Avalanche.
Will consult team leader.

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,160
- Bravo Six.
- Go to sea level.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,400
Say again your last.
Over.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,080
Bravo Six.

77
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,000
- We've lost the horizon.
- Bravo Six.

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,160
- You didn't account for that?
- Yes, sir, we did,

79
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,760
but we didn't count on the SEAL unit
being delayed for five hours...

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,160
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain.

81
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
But Keyhole-5 will be L.O.S.
in 18 minutes, sir.

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
Launch base will need
that much time to key their gear.

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,840
Advise launch base
accordingly, Goldstein. Now.

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,200
Sir, I'd recommend against it.
These are skilled operators.

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,560
They've grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back on-line.

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,960
It's just a glitch
in the net changeover, sir.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
I'll have it ironed out
momentarily.

88
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,600
Advise launch base,
Goldstein.

89
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,440
Something to add,
Lieutenant?

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,480
If we keep the primary satellite the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,360
Reestablish comms.
It's a clear shot.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,920
What about those two areas inland?
That's closer to their position.

93
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,920
But that's behind them.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,040
They'll wanna keep moving
seaward, sir, yet find a spot...

95
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,080
that gives 'em the line of sight
on the satellite.

96
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,680
This plateau here.
That's where I'd head, sir.

97
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,160
Last I checked, you were a topographic
analyst, not an operations specialist.

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,680
- Why don't you just let it-
- If they have wounded,

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,840
they might be inclined
to stay put.

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
Wait till the new bird
comes into L.O.S.

101
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
But they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub.

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,800
They'll hump their wounded out. They'll
reach this plateau in ten minutes.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,800
Make that nine now.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,880
We can't switch the net, sir.
We'll be listening for them...

105
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,040
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Give it exactly nine minutes.

107
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Okay, let's see
what the cat dragged in.

108
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
They've preapproved
all these candidates.

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,600
Top scores, marksmanship.

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,440
Distance runner. Took fifth place
in some intra-service marathon. Age 27.

111
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,680
Perfect, till they do
a chromosome check.

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,240
Some impressive
fitness reps here.

113
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,000
Holder of several records
for female power-lifting.

114
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Is this the face you want to see
on the cover of Newsweek?

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
She looks like the wife
of a Russian beet farmer.

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,000
I like this one.

117
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Triathlon, winter sports,
Olympic contender,

118
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
winner of the Arlie Burke
essay contest, works Intel.

119
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,920
- Too much of a think-tank soldier.
- No, no, show me, show me.

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,240
Well, this really is
top drawer...

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
with silk stockings inside.

122
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,360
- We've waited about as long as we dare.
- Do it.

123
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
Change the net.

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,320
Launch base,
this is N.I.C. control.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
We're going to conduct
a net changeover...

126
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,800
to Keyhole-5 at
the following coordinates.

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,800
This is Bravo Six.
Still got six heartbeats here...

128
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,920
holding on some kind of plateau.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,120
I say again, six passengers
looking for a ride home.

130
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,320
- We're good to go.
- Belay my last.

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,800
Copy that. Maintain perimeter.
Advise further hostile status.

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
- That was good headwork, Lieutenant.
- Well, thank you, sir.

133
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,720
I'm glad we could get
involved and do some good.

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Now the problem is,
Intel officers don't get involved.

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
We monitor, analyze.

136
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,000
You need to learn
the fine art of detachment, Lieutenant.

137
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,600
Excuse me, there's a call
from the Sec Nav's office.

138
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
- I'll take it inside.
- No, sir, excuse me.

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Lieutenant O'Neil,
the call's for you.

140
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,840
I'll take it inside.

141
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,320
Thanks for holding.
I'll put you through.

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,320
I'm thinking about redoing
the place.

143
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,480
It's beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years.

144
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,640
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Lieutenant.

145
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,560
Ma'am, may I ask
what this is regarding?

146
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,960
- Didn't they tell you?
- No, ma'am.

147
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,840
Well, this'll be a toot.
You read, I'll pour.

148
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,680
It's just a test case, Jordan,

149
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,600
but if things work out,
if you can go the distance,

150
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,600
it could well change the military's
official policy on women in combat.

151
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,240
Or, actually,
its official non-policy.

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Begging your pardon,
Senator,

153
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,040
but you do understand this
involves SEAL training?

154
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,720
I do.
I also understand...

155
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,080
that you applied for active duty
during the Gulf War and got turned down.

156
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes, ma'am, there was an Intel slot
available aboard the U.S.S. Polk,

157
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,480
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women.

158
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,040
- Did that piss you off?
- Yes, ma'am, it did.

159
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Good. I like pissed off.

160
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,280
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- Yes, ma'am.

161
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,000
Have you got a man?

162
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,800
- Ma'am?
- At home?

163
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Fiance. Steady beau. You know,
some kind of solid heterosexual.

164
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,680
I hate askin', but I don't want
this thing blowin' up in our faces...

165
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
if you happen to be battin'
for the other side.

166
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,480
Yes, ma'am, there's someone.

167
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Well, wonderful.

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,920
Honey, come on. I survived jump school,
dive school and three brothers.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,840
I think I can take care
of myself.

170
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,920
The only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I'm just not interested in being
some poster girl for women's rights.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
- What?
- Hmm?

173
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,920
- What?
- What?

174
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,440
You don't have anything
to say about this?

175
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,120
I guess I don't.

176
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Honey, this is just
a career opportunity.

177
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,720
- You don't want me sleeping my way to the top, do you?
- But the SEALS, babe?

178
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,280
These guys are world-class warriors.
They see you coming-

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
- I mean-
- I'm aware they may not want me there.

180
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
- "May not"?
- Yes.

181
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,480
They will eat corn flakes
out of your skull. Okay?

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,840
To tell you the truth,

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I don't get it.

184
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,160
I mean, you're doing
shit-hot at Intel.

185
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for?

186
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
Royce, we're the same age.
We entered the Navy the same month.

187
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,720
Which one of us
is wearing more ribbons?

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, come on. This is just 'cause
I got lucky during the Gulf War.

189
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes, thank you. Operational experience
is a key to advancement.

190
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Yet anyone with tits can't be on a sub,
can't be a SEAL, and don't even think-

191
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Hey, whoa, whoa.
If you made up your mind to do it, go.

192
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,360
You always do what you wanna do anyway.
Don't ask my permission.

193
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,000
You wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cock-swinging commandos for three months-

194
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,920
Three months?

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,840
What if I make this and go operational
for three years? What then?

196
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,400
Oh, man, did I just miss
a decade or something?

197
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,360
Will I wait if you go off to war?
Is that what you're asking me?

198
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,400
Yeah, something like that.
Exactly like that.

199
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
I didn't know I was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight, Jordan.

200
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
Maybe we should just
let this happen.

201
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
Get your dick back in here.

202
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,840
Don't ask me to tell you how I'm gonna
feel in three years. I don't know.

203
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,760
I mean, neither do you.

204
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,640
Right up until you said that,
I thought I did.

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
Carry on.

206
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,480
Put it down! Here we go!

207
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,480
Lieutenant O'Neil
reporting for training, sir.

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Yes, of course.

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,840
Please, Lieutenant,
have a seat.

210
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,760
Thank you, sir.

211
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,160
Would you care for a beverage?
Tea? Soda?

212
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,720
- I'm fine, sir.
- You sure?

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, we're still coming to
terms with the exact protocol...

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,840
for the integration
of our SEAL C.R.T. training.

215
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,720
- Barber was my next stop, sir. I-
- Don't worry about it.

216
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,640
As long as it's off your collar, out of
your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

217
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,520
Sir, I'm not looking
for any special treatment.

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,680
We're not trying to change
your sex, Lieutenant.

219
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,760
You'll have a separate bed,
a separate head.

220
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,920
If you have any special medical needs,
inform the infirmary.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
If your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing...

222
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,560
or otherwise unbecoming manner,

223
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,080
you are to inform me
immediately,

224
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,200
so that I can deal with it
immediately.

225
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,240
It may not always run smooth,

226
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,320
but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible.

227
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,080
Thank you, sir, but I expect
a certain amount of pain.

228
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,400
- Any questions?
- None at this time, sir.

229
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,960
Then we're done, Lieutenant.

230
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes, sir.

231
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,120
Permission to speak, sir?

232
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,440
I'm not here to make
some kind of statement.

233
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,000
I care about completing the training
and getting operational experience,

234
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,000
just like everyone else,
I suspect.

235
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,200
If you were like everyone else,
Lieutenant,

236
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,320
I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements...

237
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
about not making statements,

238
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
would we?

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,440
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

240
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Come on.

241
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,920
Average woman, 25 percent body fat.
Twenty-five.

242
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,600
That's a quarter fat, man.
I mean, think about that.

243
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,160
If she pulls her own weight,
I got no problem with it.

244
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,640
No split-tail's getting through
this program. No way, Jose.

245
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,320
Oh, man, doesn't she know
it's rude to point?

246
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,640
Whoo-hoo!

247
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,880
Look, I don't know what she did
to get in here. I hate to speculate.

248
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,520
I know I petitioned for two years
to get into this program.

249
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,080
Two years of letter writing,
two years of pulling strings,

250
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
and I finally get here,
and it's gone co-ed?

251
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,680
Elite combat unit.
Whose genius idea was that?

252
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,720
That's bullshit. I mean, they can't do
what we can. How's it happen?

253
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,080
All I'm sayin' is one night, Lord. Give
me one night, and I'll set her straight.

254
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,680
Slovnik's feeling good
like a hard man should.

255
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,320
Stow it, gentlemen.
You heard the policy.

256
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,960
Attention on deck!

257
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,960
Stand easy.

258
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,000
Welcome to SEAL C.R.T.
selection program.

259
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,440
You have volunteered for
the most intensive military training...

260
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,320
known to man.

261
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,760
You are all proven operators
within the spec ops community.

262
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,840
SEALS,

263
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,800
E.O.D.,

264
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Army Delta,
Marine Force Recon,

265
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,760
Naval intel community,

266
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,920
and so on.

267
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,040
In spite of your expertise,

268
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,880
many of you will not successfully
negotiate this program.

269
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,680
Those that do will experience
an operational tempo...

270
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,480
that far exceeds that of any unit
within the U.S. arsenal.

271
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
That is all
that is to be said...

272
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,200
about the special nature
of the C.R.T. training program.

273
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,360
I now turn you over...

274
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
to my Command Master Chief
John James Urgayle.

275
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,960
Attention!

276
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,320
Instructors, stand easy.

277
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,960
I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself.

278
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,400
A bird will fall frozen dead
from a bough...

279
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,480
without ever having felt
sorry for itself.

280
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,960
The ebb and flow
of the Atlantic tides,

281
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,440
the drift of the continents,

282
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,720
the very position of the sun
along its ecliptic.

283
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,120
These are just a few of the things
I control in my world.

284
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,240
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Command Master Chief!

285
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,600
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Command Master Chief!

286
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,800
Instructor Pyro.

287
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,040
Aye-aye, Master Chief.

288
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,960
Instructors.

289
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,560
Boat crews, stand by your boats.
Move your asses!

290
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
Get 'em up high!
Move your asses!

291
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,520
Get 'em up high!

292
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
Forward, double time!
Hut!

293
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,840
Hold them up, girls.
Come on. Don't you embarrass me.

294
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,800
Get that up!

295
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,400
What are you people, handicapped?
Get your feet up! Move it!

296
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,400
This day hasn't even begun!
Move it around!

297
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,680
Move the boat around!

298
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,880
Prepare to down boat!

299
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,080
Down boat, and don't you bruise
my sensitive fanny!

300
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,480
I will run your butt
all the way to the beach!

301
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,000
I have had better boat rides
by your mothers!

302
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
Worm sperm,
every damn one of you!

303
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,120
Instructor, get these spoon-chested
pencil-necks out of my face!

304
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
All yours, Master Chief.

305
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,280
Take a good look
at your new home.

306
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,200
Clarkson, get your boat crews!
Fall out by the fenders now!

307
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,040
Move it, move it,
move it, move it!

308
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,040
Sixty percent of you
will not pass this course!

309
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,360
How do I know? Because that is
an historical fact!

310
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,280
Now for the bad news!

311
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,160
I always like to get
one quitter on the first day!

312
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,800
And until I do,
that first day does not end!

313
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,360
Look around! Look to your right!

314
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,880
Look to your left.
I just wonder who it's gonna be.

315
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,640
Who's got the hair
to stick it out?

316
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,120
Come on! Be a part
of your crew's solution!

317
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
- There's one goin' down!
- What are you doing on your knees?

318
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,480
- Stamm, are you hurt?
- No!

319
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,960
You wanna quit? Then get the fuck up,
Stamm! Get back on that fender!

320
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,360
- Get up, guy! What the hell is going on?
- Flea. Flea, you all right?

321
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,640
- What the fuck you doin' with him?
- Whoo-hoo!

322
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,120
- What's your name, pancake?
- Flea! I mean, Montgomery, sir!

323
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,080
Don't call me sir, moron.
I work for a living.

324
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
- How many names you got anyway?
- It's F. Lee Montgomery, but that just gets whittled down to Flea.

325
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,560
- Are you my quitter, Mr. Flea?
- No, sir, Master Chief!

326
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,960
Nothin' to be ashamed of, sir.
Do you wanna quit?

327
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,520
Not me, Master Chief!
I'm full of joy!

328
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,960
What the hell is going on
down there?

329
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Move that fender!

330
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,400
Class!
Class, stand in line!

331
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,080
Drop down, bent over push-ups!

332
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,440
Quit playing with your hair,
O'Neil, and drop down!

333
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,000
- If you can't do these right, O'Neil, do 'em on your knees!
- I like these just fine, sir.

334
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Down!

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,040
Half a night, Lord.
Just give me half a night.

336
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,520
- Cortez, stow the shit!
- I'm just having a sexual fantasy here!

337
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,560
You have to be harder
than the average man...

338
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,640
to even get in
this program!

339
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,240
But I know some of you are already
thinking seriously about quitting!

340
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,680
Get in this program, Stamm!

341
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Come on!
You don't need this abuse!

342
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,680
Stamm, I think I have a quitter!
Do I have a quitter?

343
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,080
Be ashamed for the rest
of your fucking lives!

344
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,960
Go!

345
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,960
Get out of that water!

346
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
Roll! Right there!

347
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,560
Roll!

348
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,600
Pain is your friend,
your ally!

349
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,920
It will tell you
when you are seriously injured!

350
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
It will keep you awake
and angry...

351
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,760
and remind you to finish
the job...

352
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
and get the hell home!

353
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,520
But you know the best thing
about pain?

354
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,400
I don't know!

355
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,720
It lets you know
you're not dead yet!

356
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,880
I've seen Girl Scouts
move quicker than this!

357
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,800
You people are pathetic!
Down boat!

358
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,520
Mr. Wickwire,
you have four minutes...

359
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,080
to secure swim gear
and down chow!

360
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,960
Your entire class will
be severely penalized...

361
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,920
Get your asses going!
Get moving!

362
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,760
Goddamn it, what the fuck are you doing
sitting in my chair?

363
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,520
Get the hell out of here!

364
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,440
Scrape your plates!
Get the hell out of here!

365
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,840
Get your ass up! Get your ass up!
Get it up, boy!

366
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Get the hell out of here!

367
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,240
Scrape the plates
and get the hell out of here!

368
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,160
I want you to stroll!
Drop down!

369
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,760
Bear crawl, goddamn it! What the hell's
wrong with you, shithead?

370
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
All right, sewer trout,
everybody out!

371
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
Move it out!

372
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,000
Get in line
and get up here, people!

373
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,000
Keep the whole line long!

374
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,800
Move it, move it, move it!

375
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,200
Get on line!
Get on line right here!

376
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,840
- Get on line!
- All right, fall in! Dress it up!

377
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Get ready
for your med check!

378
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
They're all yours,
Lieutenant.

379
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,080
What's your name?

380
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,960
- Newberry.
- What day of the week is it, Newberry?

381
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,120
- It's fucking cold. That's what day of the week it is.
- Follow my finger.

382
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,880
That's good.

383
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,520
- What's your name?
- McCool.

384
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,680
- Uh-huh. Where are you from?
- San Diego.

385
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,600
San Diego.
Follow my finger.

386
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,160
- What's your name?
- O'Neil.

387
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,280
All right,
follow my finger, O'Neil.

388
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,480
- Let me see your fingertips. Cold?
- Yeah.

389
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,800
Way to gut it out,
Lieutenant.

390
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,880
All right, corpsmen, they're
gonna live. Get the hell out of there.

391
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,600
Class, fall out for chow.

392
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,080
Move. I said move, goddamn it! What
do you want to do, take another swim?

393
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,880
Maybe we don't want
chow tonight.

394
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,760
Move your girlie butts!

395
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,840
After you pack grits, report
to Alpha barracks on the double.

396
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,280
Get them dick-skinning hands out of my
garbage cans. What the hell's goin' on?

397
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,880
I told you, get your chow
and report to Alpha barracks!

398
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,440
If you feel
you cannot carry on-

399
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,560
If you now care to admit
that you are woefully out of your depth,

400
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,800
that bell is your salvation.

401
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,160
Strike it three times,
and you're out.

402
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,680
Free to get a hot shower
and a good night's sleep.

403
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,200
I know you're saying
to yourself,

404
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,640
"I'm an experienced operator.

405
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,160
"I've put up with
19 straight hours of this.

406
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,520
Do I really need
another 12 weeks?"

407
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,840
If you don't know the answer to
that question, you do not belong here.

408
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,640
- Back up, guys. Back up.
- That's all right,

409
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,280
'cause this program
is not for everyone.

410
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,160
Just step up to the bell,
save us all a lot of trouble.

411
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,520
Go ahead.
Any takers?

412
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,640
Goin' once.

413
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
Goin' twice.

414
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,320
All right,
welcome to a brand-new day.

415
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,000
I was lost

416
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,240
- Come on, now!
- In a world of light

417
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
- I always did
- I did it, y'all!

418
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,680
- What was right
- Hang on!

419
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,040
But now I sing

420
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,280
A different song

421
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,920
And I found joy

422
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,880
- In doing it wrong
- Sing it!

423
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,280
I found a friend

424
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,640
- Yeah!
- In Satan

425
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,600
- I found a friend
- Uh-huh!

426
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,560
- In Satan
- Stamm, don't do it, Stamm!

427
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,720
- I found a friend
- Come on, Stamm! Don't quit!

428
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,520
Come on, Stamm!

429
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,680
There goes Stamm.

430
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Dilettante.

431
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,680
- Slow day at the office.
- Dropped on request.

432
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,760
In no less than 500
neatly printed words,

433
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,640
tell me why you love
the United States Navy.

434
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,240
There will be no time limit
for this evolution.

435
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,600
Put that pencil down. Get your fucking
feet together and sit up straight!

436
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
You will write
when I tell you to write.

437
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,000
When I come back,
I'll be countin' open eyes. Begin.

438
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,520
Master Chief.
Rock and roll.

439
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Favorable weather conditions
for the next evolution.

440
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,080
Are you ready, Lieutenant?

441
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,760
Pencils down!
On your feet! Get up!

442
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,760
Are you ready
for the next evolution?

443
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,840
Hoo-yah, Instructor Pyro!

444
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,080
Hoo-hah!

445
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,760
Hoo-hah!

446
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,080
Hoo-hah!

447
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,320
Class, halt!

448
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,720
Right face!

449
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,760
Sling arms!

450
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,720
- Fall out! Close it in!
- Evenin', cupcakes.

451
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,840
Twelve minutes or less. That's all
you need to know about this course.

452
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,840
Group one: Newberry,

453
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,680
Hampton, McCool, Wickwire,
Slovnik and England.

454
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,320
Group two: Miller, Flea, Powell,
Ayres, Cortez and O'Neil.

455
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,240
You will find a white step
that is mandated female aid, O'Neil.

456
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,360
You will find and use them
on every barrier obstacle.

457
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,800
- Sergeant, I don't wanna use any step.
- Keep your mouth shut!

458
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,920
- I wanna go through like the rest of the guys!
- Shut your fucking hole!

459
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,920
Group three: Marshall, DeLuise,
Brown, Simons, Flynn and Stow.

460
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,880
Group one, stand by!

461
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Bust 'em!

462
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,520
Hoo-yah!

463
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,120
Group two, stand by!

464
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,720
Bust 'em!

465
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,680
Group three, stand by!
Bust 'em!

466
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,240
Move, move, move, move,
move, move!

467
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,440
- Move it! Keep moving!
- Faster!

468
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,000
O'Neil, let's go!
Let's move it on down!

469
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,880
You want me
to get you a dress?

470
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,480
- Keep it moving! Let's go!
- Do you squat when you pee?

471
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,600
Come on!

472
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,880
- Go, go, go! Go!
- This way!

473
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,960
- Go, go, go!
- Keep it clear! Move it!

474
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,720
Flea!

475
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,400
Let's move! Let's run!

476
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Move, move, move!

477
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,840
Into the tunnel!
Now!

478
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,800
Get up! Come on!

479
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,280
Cortez, get over here!
Drop down. Come on!

480
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Come on! Come on, Flea!

481
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
Come on!

482
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,560
- Come on!
- Go!

483
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,960
- That's it!
- Help me up, Jordan.

484
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,720
Come on.

485
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,400
Grab my hand.
Give me your hand.

486
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,800
Why don't you quit, O'Neil?

487
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,880
Quit now.

488
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,600
Let's go,
children. Come on. Let's go, Cortez.

489
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,560
It pays to be a winner.
Come on, move your fat ass.

490
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,640
Oh, this would be a fine time to quit,
wouldn't it, gentlemen?

491
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,960
How many quitters we got?
Come on! Move it!

492
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,160
Get on up here, mud muffins. Come on.
You guys look like sea slugs.

493
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,040
O'Neil! What are you
waitin' for, girl?

494
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,000
Get your fine fanny
down here!

495
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,560
Come on, move it!
Move it, O'Neil!

496
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,760
Oh, my God!

497
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,800
O'Neil just tripped the trip wire!
Thank you very much!

498
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,200
She is responsible for
killing the entire class.

499
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,480
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!

500
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,280
Newberry: 13:08.

501
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Cortez: 13:10.

502
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,200
Hampton: 13:15.
Blake: 13:22.

503
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,880
Presley: 13:47.

504
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,920
Pretty boy:
14 minutes flat.

505
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,440
You are the blue-ribbon loser.

506
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,360
These six have failed
the "O" course.

507
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,080
- These six will run the course again.
- No, don't do it!

508
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,360
Come on, man! Hang in there!

509
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Come on!

510
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,160
Anybody else?

511
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,640
All right.

512
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,360
The rest of you wanna-bes have two hours
before the next evolution.

513
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,240
I strongly suggest
you spend it in your racks...

514
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,960
or sick bay.

515
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,760
- Mr. Wickwire.
- Ten-hut!

516
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,440
Muster back here
at 0800...

517
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,360
in your greens.

518
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Haul out!

519
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,240
Class! As you were.

520
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,440
Sergeant Cortez,

521
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,520
however brief your stay
with this command might be,

522
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,520
there are two words you will learn
to put together:

523
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,160
Team... mate.

524
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,160
Carry on.

525
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,520
- Wickwire, you heard him. What are you waitin' for?
- Fall out. Move it!

526
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,440
- Hoo-yah!
- Hoo-yah!

527
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,320
What do we have here,
you hesitant bunch of harlots?

528
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,280
You thinkin' about ringin' that bell?
Don't think! Move!

529
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,920
Come on, somebody ring that bell
for me, please!

530
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,960
Come on, honey bun, walk!
Get your bell-bangin' balls a-rollin'!

531
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,320
You can be home
curled up in bed...

532
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,720
in less than four hours!

533
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,640
Ring that bell!

534
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,480
That is music to my ears.
I'm gettin' emotional here.

535
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,880
Anybody else?

536
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,920
What's the matter,
O'Neil?

537
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,840
Come on.

538
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,840
Come on.

539
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,760
I'd like to see
the Master Chief.

540
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,000
Lieutenant O'Neil requests
to speak to the Master Chief.

541
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,480
He's not home.

542
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Excuse me, Master Chief.

543
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Cortez finished ahead of me in group
two, but he failed and I didn't. Why?

544
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,960
Instructor Pyro,
educate the lieutenant.

545
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,840
You received an automatic
30-second deduction...

546
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,760
which put you
under the wire.

547
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,680
It's called gender-norming,
O'Neil.

548
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,840
It's standard procedure
for all females in physical training.

549
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,080
What "all females,"
if I'm the only one?

550
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,000
I think I should have
the choice.

551
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
Stand at attention.

552
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,800
Lieutenant O'Neil, when I want
your opinion, I'll give it to ya.

553
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,960
Did you take this matter up
with my Command Master Chief?

554
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,760
I believe you instructed me to come
directly to you, sir,

555
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,640
if I felt I was being
mistreated in any way.

556
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,360
Oh.

557
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,680
All right, Lieutenant.

558
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,960
I want names.
I want specific grievances.

559
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,240
Permission
to speak frankly, sir?

560
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,920
It's you, sir.

561
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,320
- It started the moment I came here.
- Oh? Really?

562
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,440
It's the double standard.

563
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,840
The separate quarters,
the deferential treatment.

564
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,720
It's the way you practically pulled
my chair out for me when we first met.

565
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,360
Because I was civil,
now you're complainin'?

566
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,280
I can't afford civility, sir.

567
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,200
How am I supposed to fit in when
you've got me set up as an outsider?

568
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,480
You've given me
a different set of rules.

569
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,680
The answer is, I can't.

570
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,160
Why don't you just issue me a
pink petticoat to wear around the base?

571
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,640
Did you just have
a brain fart?

572
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,600
Begging your pardon,
sir?

573
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,480
Did you
just waltz in here...

574
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,880
and bark at your
commanding officer?

575
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,720
If so, I regard that
as a bona fide brain fart,

576
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,520
and I resent it
when people fart inside my office.

577
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,520
I think you've resented me
from the start, sir.

578
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,000
What I resent,
Lieutenant,

579
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,480
is some politician...

580
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,360
using my base
as a test tube...

581
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,640
for her grand
social experiment.

582
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,560
What I resent...

583
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,880
is the sensitivity
training...

584
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,080
that is now mandatory
for my men,

585
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,240
the OB-GYN
I have to keep on staff...

586
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,880
just so someone can keep track
of your personal Pap smears.

587
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,480
But most of all,
what I resent...

588
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,400
is your perfume,

589
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,520
however subtle it may be,

590
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,880
competin' with the aroma
of my fine $3.59 cigar,

591
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,080
which I will put out
this instant...

592
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,960
if the phallic nature of it
happens to offend...

593
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,840
your goddamned
fragile sensibilities!

594
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,120
- Does it?
- No, sir.

595
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,240
"No, sir," what?

596
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,000
The shape
doesn't bother me, sir.

597
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,000
Just the goddamned
sweet stench.

598
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,360
One standard.

599
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,840
Just treat me the same.
No better, no worse.

600
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,080
You're gonna get
everything you want, O'Neil.

601
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,920
Let's just see if you want
what you're gonna get.

602
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,520
Hoo-yah, sir.

603
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,160
Hey-

604
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,080
Hello?

605
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,480
Anybody here?

606
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,880
Grab your sacks!
Get in line now! Move!

607
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,760
- Who the hell do you think you are, coming in here?
- Guess I'm your roommate.

608
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,640
N- N-No. You can't stay here.

609
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,600
- You can't sleep here right next to me.
- The C.O. says I can.

610
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,520
No-Come here.
Come here!

611
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,440
Cortez, come here,
goddang it!

612
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,200
Lookit. Girlfriend bring all her stuff
in here like she think she gonna-

613
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,040
- Hey!
- Shit! This is Tampax!

614
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,040
- Stand at attention!
- This is not gonna happen.

615
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,520
Stand at attention!

616
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,400
Mr. Wickwire,
in your leisure time...

617
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,680
make out a schedule that rotates
head and shower usage.

618
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,040
Yes, Master Chief.

619
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,480
Anything else we can do
for your celebrity career, Lieutenant?

620
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,680
- That'll be all-
- You now have exactly one minute to muster!

621
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,040
If even one of you
Van Winkle wanna-bes are late,

622
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,600
I will personally see
none of you sleep for a week!

623
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,280
Let me get this straight:
We're sharing the same fucking head?

624
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,640
Listen, you moron,
I am here to stay.

625
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,280
If you don't wanna be in my life,
move out or ring out.

626
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,200
- That's it. End of file.
- You got one minute to put your fuckin' clothes on.

627
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,080
- What about the tampons?
- Hey, hey, hey.

628
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,360
- Don't you care about tampons?
- Get over yourself, Slovnik.

629
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,240
- Put your clothes on. Let's go!
- Nice.

630
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,280
- Here we go.
- Here we go!

631
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,520
Pick 'em up!
Put 'em down!

632
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,360
I'll have another one.

633
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
Thanks a lot.

634
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,600
Oh, congratulations,
Mr. Secretary.

635
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,360
Say hello to the President
for me, will you?

636
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,800
So, what was the deal you made
with the devil? I mean, DeHaven.

637
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,720
- Oooh.
- Didn't you hear?

638
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,600
Effective immediately,
all vessels in the Navy...

639
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,600
can no longer
be referred to as "she. "

640
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,480
We're to call it "it. "

641
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,960
- Royce, we need a fourth.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,560
- You're it.
- Thank you, sir.

643
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,120
- Hello!
- Congratulations on the new job.

644
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,520
- You'll make a fine-
- Mr. Secretary, sir.

645
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,840
Oh, man.

646
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,720
Not playing down to the abilities
of your superior officer, are you?

647
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,800
No, sir. Snooker's just
not my game.

648
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,720
Too many balls
on the table.

649
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,840
Distracting, isn't it? That one
pink ball right in the middle.

650
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,560
- Who's got a cigar?
- Didn't know you smoked, sir.

651
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,400
I don't. I just want to chew
the hell out of it.

652
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,760
Uh, "The woman, identity unknown,
is believed to be...

653
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,360
"the first female candidate for
the elite Navy SEALS training program.

654
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,160
Her presence could signal a shift
in the military's-"

655
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,960
These were supposed to have been
discreet test cases.

656
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,920
That was
the agreement.

657
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,520
Suppose this lady's getting friendly
with the press?

658
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,960
It's DeHaven. Had to be. She is gonna
milk this cow on all four tits.

659
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,320
In the last two hours my office
has received 14 requests for interviews.

660
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,640
No interviews.
That's the last thing we need.

661
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,520
Where is she in the training,
this woman?

662
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,880
We'll have that information
for you before the night's out.

663
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,680
It's my understanding that she just
finished the P.T. phase of her training.

664
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
She made it
through hell week.

665
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,680
Won't last one week,
huh?

666
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,640
So, have you been monitoring
this situation for us, Commander?

667
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,400
No, sir. I just made
some unofficial inquiries.

668
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,800
Well, make it official.

669
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,800
I want a brief back in my office
once a week.

670
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,760
G.I. Jane. Why don't they just get it
over with and call her Joan of Arc?

671
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,400
Your shot, Gary.

672
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,720
Pardon me, sir. Phone call
from Senator DeHaven.

673
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,600
Captain Salem here.

674
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,480
Are you in the habit of lettin'
photographers traipse around your base,

675
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,400
snapping their fill?

676
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,360
These are supposed to be
discreet test cases.

677
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,120
Senator, they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses.

678
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,000
There is nothin'
I can do about it,

679
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,600
unless you want me to infringe
on their civil liberties,

680
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,760
which I'll be glad to do if you'll just
trim a little fat off the Constitution.

681
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,320
Did you just mouth off to a senior
member of the Senate Arms Committee?

682
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,560
I'll give you points for style,
just nothin' for smarts.

683
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,920
- I was just explaining-From this
point forward, I want all press matters...

684
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,840
coordinated via my office.

685
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,600
Let me handle the R.P.M.

686
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,040
I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna watch
Hayes pull flowers out of his ass...

687
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,960
and take credit
for this one.

688
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,800
I'll be sure to pass your request along
to my chain of command.

689
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,720
Good.

690
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,120
Now, how's my girl
doin', anyway?

691
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,200
You need to know
what it feels like to drown...

692
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,240
in order
to avoid panic...

693
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,800
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life.

694
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,840
The natural tendency
toward premature panic...

695
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,000
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique.

696
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
Carb 15.
Military designator: M4.

697
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,480
Nothing more than a chopped-down
version of the M16 assault rifle.

698
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
By taking the proper
precautions,

699
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,360
this weapon can be considered
water-resistant.

700
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,000
Many techniques have been developed
to seal the muzzle of the weapon.

701
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,280
- Nothing, however, surpasses the technique developed in my time.
- Crazy. Wild.

702
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,760
Shut up, Slovnik.

703
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,920
Boat six: Wickwire, McCool, Flea,
Cortez, Slovnik and O'Neil.

704
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,240
Oh, come on.

705
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,400
Somebody got a problem
with my organizational skills?

706
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,360
Fine by me,
Master Chief.

707
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,320
No problem here,
Master Chief.

708
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,120
Stand by. Prepare to hit the surf.
Move!

709
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,680
Boat four,
answer me this:

710
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,960
When I see the sea once more,
will the sea have seen or not seen me?

711
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,640
This will be
a graded exercise.

712
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,560
On my mark.
Stand by.

713
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,320
Mark!

714
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,200
- Cortez, done.
- Time!

715
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,120
Weapons on the table.

716
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,840
Is it hot out here,
or is it just me?

717
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,160
- Kind of tender?
- It's okay.

718
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,520
Mmm. This?

719
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,400
- A little bit.
- Okay, you can get dressed.

720
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,800
Try to get as much air on those
abrasions on your back as you can.

721
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,800
It's called amenorrhea
when you lose your period.

722
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,640
It's because you drop body fat, but
not at all unusual for female athletes.

723
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,640
Okay, you got tendinitis
in your right knee...

724
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,480
and, uh, that is standard issue
jungle rot on your left foot.

725
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,960
- Lovely.
- So, you're quite a mess.

726
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,440
Let's fix me up
and get me back out there.

727
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,440
- Hey, Jordan!
- Whoa! Ladies!

728
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,720
If I follow you home,
would you have premarital sex with me?

729
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,080
Slovnik! You're barkin' up
the wrong dress. They ain't your type.

730
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,240
Shit fire
and save matches.

731
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,960
Goddamn three-ring circus
around here. Shit.

732
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,280
You trying to be bad?

733
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,240
You could be home curled up,
playin' with electrical toys!

734
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,960
Go on!

735
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,040
Lieutenant,
why are you doing this?

736
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,320
- Do you ask the men the same question?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

737
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,680
- And what do they say?
- 'Cause I get to blow shit up.

738
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,600
Well, there you go.

739
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,800
On my mark. Stand by!

740
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,720
Mark!

741
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,160
- O'Neil, done.
- Cortez, done.

742
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,280
Does it work, Lieutenant?

743
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,280
Well done, Lieutenant.

744
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,040
The Navy is still
declining to release the woman's name,

745
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,280
but Senator DeHaven's office
is confirming that G.I. Jane...

746
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,320
has outlasted many of her male
counterparts in the elite Navy program,

747
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,320
said to be one of
the most grueling anywhere.

748
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,640
Joining us now on Washington Tonight,
for the feminist perspective-

749
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,600
Coxswain, hard a-port!

750
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,960
- Line it up! Move it over!
- Come about!

751
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,000
Straighten 'er out!

752
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,040
- Line 'er up!
- Stay on your line! Get ready!

753
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,880
- Whoo!
- Come on! Move aft!

754
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,360
Get up there!
Let's go, go, go!

755
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,160
Hoo-fucking-yah! It's like having sex
in a car crash! Whoo-hoo!

756
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,480
Okay, McCool, get up there.
Hoo-yah, baby!

757
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,000
Come on, O'Neil.
Get on up here.

758
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,200
Let's go.
Use your arms! God!

759
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,920
- Come on, O'Neil!
- Cut her loose!

760
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,440
Let her go!

761
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,680
Well, hoo-yah. About time
we dropped some dead weight.

762
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,560
We don't leave
our people behind!

763
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,720
What the hell you waitin' for?
Get with your crew! Get in there!

764
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,280
Let's go!
Let's go!

765
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,800
Come on, go!
You're swimmin' home!

766
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,440
- Wanna pick 'em back up?
- Let's go home.

767
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,200
Well, this is bullshit.

768
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,320
Now they're hammering me
just because she's in my boat crew.

769
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,280
If you'd kept your mouth shut, we
wouldn't be out here in the first place.

770
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,280
Had a grandfather
wanted to be a Navy man.

771
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:43,720
He wanted to fire them big guns
off them big-ass battleships.

772
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,960
Navy says to him, "No. You can only do
one thing on a battleship, son.

773
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,840
"That's cook. "

774
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,760
I'm not talkin' about
100 years ago, either.

775
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,120
I'm talkin' the United States Navy,
middle of World War Two.

776
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,400
You know the reason
they gave him?

777
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,880
The reason why they told my grandfather
he couldn't fight for his country?

778
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,280
'Cause Negroes
can't see at night.

779
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,200
Bad night vision.

780
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,840
Damn, McCool.
That's unbelievable.

781
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,960
Thank God
times have changed.

782
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,880
Have they?

783
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,920
So, you see, O'Neil,

784
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,840
I know where
you're coming from.

785
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,760
To them you're just the new nigger
on the block, that's all.

786
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,640
- You just moved in a little too early.
- Thanks, man.

787
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,960
The Israelis
tried it.

788
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,840
Women in combat.

789
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,000
Seems the men couldn't get used
to the sight of women blown open.

790
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,040
They'd linger over
the wounded females,

791
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,320
often trying to save those
who obviously couldn't be saved,

792
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,200
often to the detriment
of the mission.

793
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,080
You were given
the Navy Cross, right?

794
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,480
Can I ask
what you got it for?

795
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,880
Since it bears
on this conversation,

796
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,040
I got it for pulling a 240-pound man
out of a burning tank.

797
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,920
So when a man tries to rescue
another man, he's a hero,

798
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,240
but when he tries to rescue a woman,
he's just gone soft.

799
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,520
Could you have
pulled that man clear?

800
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,280
You couldn't even haul your own
body weight out of the water today.

801
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,200
Permission to get dressed,
Master Chief.

802
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,720
Mr. England went out
with a stress fracture.

803
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,640
I'm moving Mr. Wickwire to boat five.
That puts you in charge of six.

804
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,560
Why not McCool?
He's the same rank?

805
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,320
Because you were commissioned a month
earlier. Makes you senior officer.

806
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,200
Remember,
there are no bad crews,

807
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,120
only bad leaders.

808
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,920
In the more academically
oriented evolution,

809
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,480
she's receiving
better marks than most.

810
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,360
Plus, she's outlasted
40 percent of her peers.

811
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,240
- With dual standards.
- Actually, no, sir.

812
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,200
She's been going head-to-head
with the men for some time now.

813
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,720
So she's lasted eight weeks.
That's wonderful.

814
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,640
Joan of Arc
meets Supergirl.

815
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,160
With S.E.R.E. training
coming up next week, sir.

816
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,320
Commander, we'd like to see
more detail in your reports.

817
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,200
Let's include
more background information.

818
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,360
Past training reps; medical history;
any grievances she previously filed.

819
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,080
Understood?

820
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,360
Um, actually,
not completely, sir.

821
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,320
Am-Am I being asked to provide
ammunition against this woman...

822
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,560
in case the outcome isn't
what the Navy expects, sir?

823
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,360
Absolutely not. We're simply
documenting as thoroughly as possible,

824
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,920
in the event this turns
into a legal matter.

825
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,440
Don't read anything
Machiavellian into it, Commander.

826
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,720
I'll try not to, sir.

827
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,680
Take your leave,
Commander.

828
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,600
Thank you.

829
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,520
Loganville. Wilmington.
Coronado. Bedsford.

830
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,440
This is deeper
than we thought.

831
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,640
Look at Texas.

832
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,880
I count four-
no, five bases.

833
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,800
We may not have to suffer
DeHaven much longer.

834
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,200
She stands to lose 6,000 military,
4,000 civilian jobs,

835
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,680
maybe 350 million
in lost revenue per annum.

836
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,600
Re-election's
six months off.

837
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,920
The D.O.D.'s put her
out of business.

838
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,360
Yeah.

839
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,720
People in Washington are scope-locked
on what's happening down there.

840
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,880
- Know how they're talking about you?
- I saw a newspaper.

841
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,960
That's the public side.
Privately, it's all being documented.

842
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,200
I mean everything, right down
to your breakfast and bra size.

843
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,120
Why are you
telling me this?

844
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,520
Big symbols
make big targets, Jordan.

845
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,760
There's a lot of people
who don't want to see you finish.

846
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,640
How about you, Royce?

847
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,680
Do you want
to see me finish?

848
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,560
Look, I'm just trying
to warn you. All right?

849
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,360
Get you thinkin' about
where this might be headed in case-

850
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,840
Well, let me
just warn you.

851
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,240
I'm gonna go through
with this,

852
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,960
and the more everybody fucks with me,
the more I wanna gut it out.

853
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,840
So don't you expect me back
anytime soon.

854
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,720
Look, that is not
what I want, Jordan.

855
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,640
I mean-
Goddamn it.

856
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,520
It is, but it isn't.
Do you understand?

857
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,920
Still having a hard time
making decisions?

858
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,680
Jordan, just
watch your six, okay?

859
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,200
I gotta go, Royce.

860
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,120
Wait a second.
Don't-

861
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,320
Survival, evasion,
resistance and escape.

862
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,240
This is it, tadpoles.

863
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,680
Your target is inside
an area of five square miles.

864
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,080
When and if
you locate this facility,

865
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,160
you gather up as much intel as possible
within the allotted time frame...

866
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:10,080
and get
the hell outta there.

867
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,120
You will be penalized for early
extraction, but even more for capture.

868
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,120
Trust me.
Welcome to S.E.R.E.

869
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,560
- Get ready! Stand up!
- Stand up! Aye!

870
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,240
- Thirty seconds!
- Thirty seconds! Aye!

871
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,400
First man up, go!

872
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,440
Go!

873
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,800
Go!

874
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,080
So, where'd they drop us,
L.T.?

875
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,880
At the line of march,
2-1-0.

876
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,760
And just for shits and giggles, let's
switch to five for tactical traffic.

877
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,240
Maintain casual dialogue
on assigned channels.

878
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,560
Slovnik, take us to 2-1-0.
Cortez, move out.

879
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,720
Move out.

880
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,800
Let's go.

881
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,520
Four clicks, 2-2-6.

882
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,960
She doesn't have one fuckin' clue
where we're goin'.

883
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,360
Shut up.

884
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,480
Cortez, Slov,
you take my left flank.

885
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,400
The rest of us,
move back.

886
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,680
Looks like
she's right on the money.

887
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,160
I had a busted watch once,
and it was right twice a day.

888
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,000
Cortez.

889
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,280
Target ahead.
Belay my last.

890
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,680
New rally point,
my location.

891
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,640
McCool, Newberry,
right side.

892
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,720
Flea, you come with me.
Let's move out.

893
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,200
Listen up,
everybody. We need film from all angles.

894
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,240
Record weapons, vehicles.
Count bad guys, Get ranks, if visible.

895
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,720
Slov, Cortez, check antenna
for comms capability.

896
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,280
- McCool?
- There's nothing there, O'Neil.

897
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,720
There are no prisoners,
there are no guards.

898
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,240
Maybe we found this place
a little too easy. There's nobody there.

899
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,040
Cortez.

900
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,040
- McCool. Ten o'clock.
- Cortez!

901
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,600
What the hell
are you doing?

902
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,560
This is Team Leader to Team Fuck-up.
Knock the grab-ass off.

903
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,200
Get back to your positions.
You're compromising the unit.

904
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,480
- That's an order. Do it now.
- What are these fuckin' clowns doing?

905
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,600
No, Slov.

906
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,200
It's just a souvenir.

907
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,920
No, Slov, not-

908
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,960
What the hell-

909
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,080
Shouting ]
- Let's go!

910
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,560
Welcome to summer camp, boys and girls!

911
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,040
Blessed is he
who expected nothing,

912
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,200
for he shall not
be disappointed!

913
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,120
Rendezvous
rally point.

914
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,480
Come on!

915
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,560
Let's go!

916
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,200
- It snapped.
- Oh, shit.

917
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,600
Move your hand, man. All right, don't
move. You're only gonna make it worse.

918
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,880
- Oh, Jesus.
- Aaaah!

919
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,440
Get up. Get up!

920
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,320
Get off me!
I can't fucking breathe!

921
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,480
Get him up.

922
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,400
Aaaah!

923
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,080
Flea.
Are you all right?

924
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

925
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,800
Get down!

926
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:06,000
Who's in charge here?
Got any officers here?

927
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,600
Got somethin' to say down here?

928
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,800
- You an officer. Huh?
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

929
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,440
You're too fuckin' ugly
to be an fuckin' officer.

930
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,480
Who's the officer in charge? Huh?

931
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,560
You in charge here?

932
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,760
I am! I am!

933
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,720
Boy, that was stupid.

934
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,280
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

935
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,560
So you're in charge, huh?

936
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,560
Get him in the cage!

937
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,760
Get him
in the cage!

938
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,280
Any other officers here?

939
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,560
Get him in the cage.
Move it!

940
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,240
Third box.

941
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,960
Wake up, sunshine.

942
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,360
Shut up!

943
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,760
Get up!

944
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,120
- Don't let 'em break you, Flea.
- Take it easy, man!

945
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,800
You know,

946
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,360
I had an apartment
this size once.

947
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,480
We're gonna be all right.
Right, Wick?

948
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,840
We're gonna make it,
right?

949
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,400
I don't know.
Last time I didn't.

950
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,320
What happened?

951
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,560
I had a problem
with small spaces.

952
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,480
But as you can see, I've-
I've worked that out.

953
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,360
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

954
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,560
Aaah!

955
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,640
Don't let 'em use me against you,
no matter what. Okay?

956
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,920
Okay.

957
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,520
What the fuck is your problem?

958
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,360
Owww!
Aaaah!

959
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,080
What's your problem?

960
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,680
Are you hurt, Flea, or just injured?

961
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,680
If you're injured, we'll get you off the
island and get you medical attention.

962
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,480
'Course, you ain't ever
gonna see your crew again.

963
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,200
- If you're simply hurt, we're just gonna carry on.
- Which is it, Ensign?

964
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,920
What's it gonna be?

965
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,960
Aaaah! Stop!
I'm hurt! I'm hurt!

966
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,920
That's a brave response.
What's it gonna be?

967
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,800
Let's try it again,
Flea.

968
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,760
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

969
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,640
Aaaah!

970
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,000
- Give it up, man!
- What's it gonna be, Ensign?

971
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,960
Please. Please.

972
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Please don't fuckin'
do that anymore.

973
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,920
Where are they?

974
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,800
We'll just let you
back in your hole.

975
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,720
He's done.

976
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,560
Aaaah!

977
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,840
What is
your father's name?

978
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,680
It's a simple question,
Lieutenant.

979
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,560
No reason not to answer,
unless you wanna bleed.

980
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,480
What is
your father's name?

981
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,200
Dad.

982
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,440
How 'bout brothers or sisters?
You got any of them?

983
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,800
Dick, Jane and Spot.

984
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,720
You hungry,
O'Neil?

985
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,360
What's your favorite food, honey?
Maybe we can get you something to eat.

986
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,640
Green eggs and ham.

987
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,880
"Green eggs and ham. "

988
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,760
Why didn't you carry out
your wounded, Lieutenant?

989
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,040
Was he too heavy,

990
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,440
or were you
just plain chicken shit?

991
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,800
You're not gettin' anything
out of me.

992
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,240
You might as well just
put me back in the cage.

993
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,840
You are in a cage.
Right here, right now.

994
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,960
I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to be afraid?

995
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,560
Right down to your worthless womb.
This is my island.

996
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,040
Jack.

997
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:47,320
What? You got a problem
with this, Max?

998
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,960
Then get the fuck outta here!
Get out!

999
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,280
He tell you what was comin' in there?

1000
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,200
He didn't tell me shit.

1001
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,920
You think we should go easy
on women, Lieutenant?

1002
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,320
Do ya?

1003
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,880
- Fuck you.
- I'm so glad we agree.

1004
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,480
Two fire teams are still in the woods.
Who's gonna give me a fix on 'em?

1005
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,440
Anyone can stop this.

1006
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,600
Just give me one good piece of intel,
and it ends right here.

1007
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,640
Ohhh! Ohh!

1008
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,440
- Hang tough.
- Hang in there, O'Neil.

1009
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,200
- You got something to tell me?
- Don't do it. Don't do it.

1010
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,120
They're gonna kill you,
O'Neil!

1011
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,680
Ever think about what happens
when you're captured, Lieutenant?

1012
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,280
Oh, yeah.
Just like the men do.

1013
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,480
We practice these things
so you know what to expect.

1014
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,160
Should I practice bleeding too?
Would that make me a better soldier?

1015
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,720
Couldn't hurt.
Not in your case.

1016
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,160
This is bullshit.
It's a fuckin' game, O'Neil.

1017
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:44,400
Mr. Newberry! You gonna be chivalrous,
put a stop to this abuse?

1018
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,400
- O'Neil, tell him somethin' or I will!
- Don't you tell him shit!

1019
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,600
Aaaah!

1020
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
Get him!
Don't let him get up!

1021
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,720
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get up!

1022
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,840
- Get up, O'Neil!
- Keep on him! Hit him while he's dazed.

1023
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,480
Oh, don't you look pretty.

1024
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,400
Don't start somethin'
you can't finish.

1025
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,000
- Come on! Get up, O'Neil!
- Get back, O'Neil!

1026
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,520
- Come on, Jordan.
- Get up. Come on.

1027
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,080
- Lay low!
- Be tough!

1028
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,720
No!

1029
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,440
You're a real fuckin' hero, man.

1030
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,480
Guys, I'm savin' her life...

1031
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,760
and yours.

1032
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,560
Her presence
makes us all vulnerable.

1033
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,800
I don't want you learning
that inconvenient fact...

1034
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,400
under fire.

1035
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,960
- Master Chief.
- Lieutenant!

1036
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,280
Seek life elsewhere.

1037
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,480
Suck my dick!

1038
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,360
Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1039
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:42,120
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1040
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,800
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

1041
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,760
Suck my dick!

1042
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,080
Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
Suck my dick!

1043
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,920
- Move out!
- Suck my dick! Suck my dick!

1044
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,600
It was out of line
in there.

1045
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,200
It ain't gonna happen
again.

1046
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,720
Yeah, it will.

1047
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,720
Maybe not with you
or with these guys or with me.

1048
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,640
She's not the problem.

1049
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,000
We are.

1050
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,240
She just made it
through S.E.R.E. training.

1051
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,440
- She actually made it.
- Goddamn, that girl is good.

1052
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,360
Oh, by the way,
Newsweek called.

1053
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:44,920
- They want to do a cover story on you and G.I. Jane.
- Wonderful news, Peter.

1054
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,640
Let's talk about this when I get back
to the office. Thank you, darling.

1055
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,920
Newsweek.

1056
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:56,240
Great. They can come take your picture
at the retirement home in Waco.

1057
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,120
Five of our bases
they wanna close.

1058
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,480
D.O.D. tried this trick with Resnik in
California five years ago and it worked.

1059
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,640
He was not re-elected.
You want that to happen in Texas?

1060
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,520
Douglas, nothing's final
till you see it on CNN.

1061
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,400
There's a reason
they gave you that hit list.

1062
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,360
You think they want
a horse trade?

1063
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,240
I think they're waitin'
for your call.

1064
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,120
Hey.

1065
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,880
Hi, O'Neil. I would've paid money
to have been there.

1066
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,760
- Oh, you heard, huh?
- I think it was on the evening news.

1067
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,240
Geez. Just what
I need-more P.R.

1068
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:50,320
Listen, a few of us are
gonna go over to the beach.

1069
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,640
It's just a barbecue. No big deal.
You wanna come along?

1070
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:56,000
Well, actually, my crew
has invited me out for a drink.

1071
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,000
Ooh, progress.

1072
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,960
Well, however slow, however painful,
I think they're coming around.

1073
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,440
Give me a few minutes.
I'll give you a lift.

1074
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,320
Okay. Cool.

1075
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,360
I got the next game!

1076
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,760
Another round!
I got this round.

1077
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,640
- You saw Flea?
- Yeah.

1078
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,960
- How's he doin'?
- Think his leg's gonna heal all right.

1079
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,080
I don't know about
the rest of him.

1080
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,000
He went out on medical.
They'll roll him back through.

1081
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,920
Yeah, well,
they may let him back,

1082
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,320
but I don't know if
they'll let him finish.

1083
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,880
If they want you out,
man, they'll find a way.

1084
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,720
- I'm still here.
- Hoo-yah! Great job.

1085
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,120
Oww!

1086
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,440
Yeah?

1087
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:47,680
You know, O'Neil,
I like you better when you drink.

1088
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,520
You know, Cortez,
I like you better when I drink.

1089
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,920
Shots are up, fellas!

1090
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,520
- Hoo-yah, shots!
- Hoo-yah, shots!

1091
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,400
Joe. Yeah. We need a couple more.

1092
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,160
Here we go.
Everybody's got one?

1093
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,080
All right, people.

1094
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,520
We've been through a lot of shit.
Here's to the living.

1095
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,880
- Who's got the toast?
- I've got one.

1096
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,520
Um, you guys
re-remember this one?

1097
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,840
Suck my dick!

1098
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,080
Hoo-yah!

1099
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
Just keep it down,
all right?

1100
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,560
Hey, Jordan, I was,
uh, wondering...

1101
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,480
if you, um-

1102
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,400
you're all right.

1103
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,760
I gotta get out of here.

1104
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,000
In a world of fire

1105
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,720
Really wouldn't want us
to fight for them

1106
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,840
'Cause they're
not even born

1107
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,200
We can't even fight
for ourselves anymore

1108
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,520
That's why

1109
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,280
Ain't really none of my business,
but I say leave the bastard.

1110
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,200
The future is a war

1111
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,840
The future is a war

1112
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,240
Out the window
went the perfect past

1113
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,200
A participle, particle
An atom to smash

1114
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,880
And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again

1115
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,440
Didn't we used to
know ourselves when

1116
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,560
Didn't we ever
used to be friends

1117
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,480
Before a billion years went
down the drain And that's why

1118
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,280
The future is a war

1119
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,280
The future is a war

1120
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,800
Hey, there. Hi.

1121
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,840
What happened? Where are the guys?

1122
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,520
Well, you know.
I just wasn't into picking up chicks.

1123
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,880
Wait a second.

1124
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,720
On a real world op,
we always use back-ups.

1125
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,920
Two is one,
one is none.

1126
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,840
- Is that understood?
- Yeah!

1127
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,200
O'Neil to C.O. office.

1128
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,320
O'Neil, the C.O. wants
you in his office.

1129
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,120
- Hey.
- Lieutenant, they're waiting.

1130
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:12,640
This is Admiral Gallow
and Lieutenant Burke...

1131
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,000
from the Judge Advocate
General's office.

1132
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,120
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

1133
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,760
I don't know, uh, a delicate way
to say this, Lieutenant,

1134
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,680
so I'm not
going to try.

1135
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,600
Claims have been made
that you have, uh,

1136
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,880
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety.

1137
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,280
Specifically
that you were...

1138
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,320
"seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner...

1139
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,080
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer. "

1140
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,000
Sir, is someone suggesting
that I'm a lesbian?

1141
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,760
We're not asking
if you are, Lieutenant,

1142
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,880
and you're not required
to respond even if asked.

1143
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,000
This is merely
an informal inquiry.

1144
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,480
Where did you
get these?

1145
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,360
The source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation.

1146
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,040
I see. They were
sent anonymously.

1147
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,120
Sir, I'd like to tell you that
this is completely groundless,

1148
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,960
and in no way did anything happen
with Lt. Blondell and myself.

1149
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,240
I find this just as distasteful
as you, Lieutenant.

1150
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,440
You will be required...

1151
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,000
to cooperate
with JAG and N.I.S.

1152
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,960
Naturally, you will be given a desk
pending the outcome.

1153
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,960
A desk?
Oh, this is-

1154
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:29,480
Captain, obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training.

1155
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,600
You may repeat
your training...

1156
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,800
at a future date,
if cleared.

1157
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,480
- I can't go through this shit again.
- Ratchet down, Lieutenant.

1158
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,040
- I can't go through this shit again.
- Ratchet down, Lieutenant.

1159
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,800
I would not choose
to repeat the training, sir,

1160
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,080
nor do I care
to drive a desk...

1161
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,920
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation.

1162
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:50,400
Now, I respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing.

1163
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,400
That sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum.

1164
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,400
You take it
as you will, sir.

1165
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,800
Don't worry.
It's me they're after.

1166
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,800
Hey.

1167
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,440
I couldn't get
the gas back on.

1168
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,160
I guess you've heard.

1169
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,080
Yeah.

1170
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,440
More than I really
wanted to.

1171
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,080
There was a time
I wanted you to fail,

1172
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,800
but it was only
so I could have you close...

1173
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,000
and safe...

1174
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,360
and all to myself.

1175
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,120
But you'd be hell
to live with.

1176
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,240
I love you.

1177
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,840
Okay. Here it is.

1178
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,600
- Take a look at these.
- Switch ya.

1179
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,240
Now, this was faxed
to the JAG office Tuesday.

1180
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,640
Arrived on my desk
Wednesday morning.

1181
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,520
What do you see?

1182
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:04,320
You see this?

1183
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,000
What do you see?

1184
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,800
Take a look
on the right.

1185
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,000
- Shit.
- That's right.

1186
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,640
How important is this
to you, Jordan?

1187
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,200
I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

1188
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,000
- Bridgeport Naval Base.
- Wait. Look at this.

1189
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:03,600
In Tennessee, the board recommends
closing Fort Meyers...

1190
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,160
and the Brantwood
Air Force Supply Depot.

1191
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:10,400
In Texas, the board is recommending
no closures of military bases.

1192
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,560
Last week, five bases in Texas were
on the chopping block. This week, none.

1193
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,520
What does that tell you?

1194
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,320
...in a manner equitable
to all states...

1195
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,280
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship.

1196
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,640
First and foremost,

1197
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,480
this commission worked
for the good of the country.

1198
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,560
Of course, we anticipate
some controversy...

1199
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,560
over our recommendations.

1200
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,560
But we remind everybody-
Senators, Congressmen,

1201
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:40,400
- Governors alike-
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burnham.

1202
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,480
Now might be a dandy time
for that recess.

1203
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,160
Till noon, everyone.

1204
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,040
Jordan, I heard
what happened...

1205
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,240
and I do so very much
want to talk with you,

1206
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,200
but now is scarcely
the time.

1207
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,320
I commend you, Senator.
Those were very nice photos.

1208
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,600
Yes, we did have someone
taking shots,

1209
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,840
but for future
publicity purposes.

1210
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,000
I see. So how did they end up
in the Navy's hands?

1211
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,400
Well, you'll have
to ask them that.

1212
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,520
If I have to ask
anyone again, Senator,

1213
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,440
I'll be asking on C-SPAN.

1214
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:25,160
Jordan. Come on.

1215
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,240
Here are the Senator's
case notes.

1216
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,240
Let me have it, boys.
Come on. Quickly, quickly.

1217
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,160
Close the door.

1218
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,400
Jordan, nearly every working day
I'm forced to make decisions...

1219
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,560
that would have Solomon himself
shittin' golf balls,

1220
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,360
and half of those decisions
are about political survival.

1221
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,720
I don't resent that.

1222
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,000
So if you've come here lookin' for me
to apologize for keeping alive...

1223
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,360
you better pull up a chair,
'cause you're gonna be here for a while.

1224
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,400
Tell me you didn't
sell me out.

1225
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:10,400
Tell me you didn't sink my whole career
to make you look good.

1226
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,240
Those charges
will be dismissed.

1227
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:17,400
Your career will go forward,
albeit back here in Washington.

1228
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,440
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you wanted that kind of life.

1229
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,960
Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle...

1230
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,240
with some guys
looking up your behind.

1231
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,120
I wanted the choice.
That's how it's supposed to be.

1232
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:32,920
The truth is, the choice isn't yours,
and it isn't mine.

1233
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,840
American families
are just not prepared...

1234
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:38,480
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harm's way.

1235
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,280
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

1236
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,480
Roper, Paris, Gallup, all the polls,
they all come back the same way.

1237
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,400
What are you saying?

1238
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,720
That a woman's life
is more valuable than a man's?

1239
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,640
That a woman's death
is more hurtful than a man's?

1240
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:57,960
No politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags,

1241
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,880
especially me.

1242
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,760
It was never
gonna happen anyway.

1243
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:13,200
Then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place?

1244
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,560
Truthfully?

1245
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:21,920
I never expected you to do so damn well.
I thought you'd ring out in two weeks.

1246
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,400
Bing, bang, it's over,
and we're popular.

1247
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,480
In Washington,

1248
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,840
you don't even need the Ten Commandments
if you're popular.

1249
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,920
I wonder what Secretary Hayes
would think about this...

1250
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,040
if he was to know
how you dealt me away...

1251
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,760
for bases, for votes.

1252
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,440
What makes you think
he doesn't know?

1253
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,440
Don't even think about playing politics
with me, little darling.

1254
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,360
You'll be up
way past your bedtime.

1255
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,720
And don't you think that
I will stand idly by...

1256
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,240
while anyone smears
my good name.

1257
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:13,160
Now, you get those charges voided,
Senator, and you do it today.

1258
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,360
Or what?

1259
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,120
You like pissed off?

1260
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,640
Watch this.

1261
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,880
Jordan, you're asking me
to unring a bell.

1262
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,800
- I cannot do that.
- I'm not asking.

1263
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,960
Think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself.

1264
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,840
- You have no proof!
- Accusations seem to be enough.

1265
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:38,000
- You taught me that.
- Jordan!

1266
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,040
Hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play.

1267
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,440
I'm not playing games,
Senator.

1268
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,560
I gather.

1269
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,520
I'll do it.

1270
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:57,440
Somehow,
I'll get you back in.

1271
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,120
Hey, guys.

1272
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,280
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.
Look who's back in town.

1273
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,440
Lieutenant. Come here.

1274
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:27,200
I don't know what the hell's
been going on in the last 48 hours.

1275
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,160
Frankly,
I don't give a shit.

1276
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:32,160
Good to see you too,
Master Chief.

1277
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,800
Check out
who's back, man.

1278
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,240
- Mr. Wickwire!
- Yes, Master Chief?

1279
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:43,000
Since the whole world
seems to be awake at 0500,

1280
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,320
why don't you get your class
out here and into formation.

1281
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,600
Might as well
crank it up right now.

1282
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,320
All right, Master Chief.
You guys heard him. Let's rock and roll.

1283
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,080
- Ready for round two?
- Hoo-yah, Master Chief.

1284
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:17,640
- Ready for me?
- You fuck!

1285
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:21,280
Hey, Newberry, you ever done
one of these...

1286
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,840
Operational Readiness
Exercises before?

1287
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,520
No, Slovnik.
Never operated in the Med.

1288
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,000
Well, it ain't exactly dangerous,
unless you're caught.

1289
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,760
Even though the officials know
we're comin' to test security,

1290
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,400
homeboys guarding the power station
don't know shit.

1291
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:38,680
Hey, McCool, remember that guy
that got caught...

1292
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,920
settin' charges on the oil platform
years back?

1293
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,440
I don't know, man. What?
Thomas? Taylor? I don't know.

1294
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,240
Well, he tried to explain
it was just an exercise.

1295
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,640
Well, he was talking English and
they was talkin' Arabic. So, you know.

1296
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,000
- Did he die in prison or-
- I don't know.

1297
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,920
Well, I hope you assholes are
as ready as you think you are.

1298
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:58,680
You girls are so full of shit.
No offense, O'Neil.

1299
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,600
Jordan, what do you think
about that, huh?

1300
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,920
Spending time
in some Arab prison.

1301
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,440
After six months with you, Slovnik,
I might just fucking volunteer.

1302
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,440
Now hear this. Now hear this.

1303
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:12,280
This is the Captain speaking.

1304
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:16,920
We have been directed to break from training
exercises and join the battle group Tango Chaser.

1305
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:19,400
We are proceeding
towards hostile waters.

1306
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,960
Department heads make ready
for battle conditions.

1307
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,880
That is all.

1308
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,440
- Iran or Iraq?
- Libya.

1309
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,120
At 0230, A D.O.D. satellite
dropped out of orbit.

1310
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:33,200
Normally, that's not
a cause for such concern,

1311
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:36,960
except this baby decided to drop
in Mr. Gadhafi's backyard.

1312
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,800
What's more, I've got a range
of search units-Task Unit Scorpion-

1313
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,560
already en route
to the strike zone.

1314
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:48,080
My problem is that their exit plan
has gone to total shit.

1315
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,960
Your C.R.T.'s are the closest unit
with the right capabilities.

1316
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,760
Your job would be
to facilitate extraction.

1317
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,600
Now, Master Chief,
if for one second...

1318
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:00,080
you don't think they're ready for
whatever reason, you speak to me now.

1319
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,680
- We'll be fine, sir.
- Excellent.

1320
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,120
At present, we are three miles
off the Libyan coast... here.

1321
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:14,160
Carrier support will remain
within striking distance.

1322
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,080
Their call sign is Las Vegas.

1323
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:19,840
Now, your unit is to make an
over-the-beach insertion here,

1324
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,800
link up with the Ranger Recovery
Unit Scorpion...

1325
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,680
and escort them out
without being detected.

1326
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,040
Have the Rangers recovered
the device yet, Skipper?

1327
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,160
Satellite power cells
have been located.

1328
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,080
They're humping 'em out
now as we speak.

1329
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,280
Scorpion Leader,
Scorpion Leader.

1330
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,160
This is Las Vegas.

1331
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:42,480
Be advised:
extract team under way.

1332
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,360
Advise your E.T.A.
Over.

1333
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,280
Copy, Las Vegas.
Copy, Las Vegas.

1334
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,520
E.T.A approximately
one hour, 20 minutes.

1335
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,960
- Over.
- Copy that, Scorpion Leader.

1336
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,840
Be advised rendezvous
point of extraction team...

1337
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:02,040
at the following coordinates:
3-2-1-5, 1-4-8-6.

1338
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,960
I say again,
3-

1339
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,120
Are we talking the KH family here, sir?
The subhunter satellite?

1340
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,120
Go ahead, Lieutenant.
Fill us in.

1341
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:13,520
The KH-12 Bravos
are nuclear-powered.

1342
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,400
The onboard plutonium is designed
to survive re-entry.

1343
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,120
Some kind of
protective shroud.

1344
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:22,280
The plutonium
is, uh, weapons grade.

1345
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,240
You know the drill,
Master Chief.

1346
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:26,280
- Unfortunately, I do, Skipper.
- Carry on.

1347
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,600
Who's not ready?

1348
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,440
Inner door dogged.

1349
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,320
Understand.
Inner door closed and dogged.

1350
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,720
Mark and start.

1351
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,040
- Clear. Clear.
- Clear.

1352
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,960
Okay. Mr. McCool,
set up comms.

1353
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,320
Lieutenant,
let's go find 'em.

1354
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,520
Set up a perimeter.

1355
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,040
Lieutenant.

1356
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,440
9-0-1's.
Two o'clock.

1357
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,760
Got it.

1358
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,400
I still hold four.

1359
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,720
Holy shit!

1360
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:49,000
Border patrol.
A little ratty-assed, but still.

1361
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:52,160
Yeah, parked right in the middle
of the extract corridor.

1362
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:55,640
I got 25, maybe 30 with mixed weapons-
AK's, SKS's,

1363
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:57,720
a couple RPG's.

1364
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,320
Scorpion's gonna need
to be redirected.

1365
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,720
Mr. Wickwire, come in.

1366
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,000
Do you read me,
Mr. Wickwire?

1367
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,960
- I can't raise the beach. You got 'em?
- Stand by.

1368
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:13,640
Wick, you copy?
Wick.

1369
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:18,840
Negative. I'll keep eyes on you.
Fall back, Radio Chaser.

1370
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,000
No, Lieutenant.
I got the better eyeball. You go back.

1371
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,920
- Chief, I think that I-
- Lieutenant, go.

1372
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,400
Roger that.

1373
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,360
Wait a minute. Take cover.
Take cover and freeze.

1374
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:40,120
You got a vehicle coming towards you,
coming up the hill.

1375
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,160
Stand fast.
He might blow right by ya.

1376
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,480
Nope, we're not that lucky.

1377
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:55,360
Stay down.

1378
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,920
Lieutenant,
if this goes down,

1379
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:12,440
make it silent.

1380
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,400
Control your breathing.

1381
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,080
Comin' at ya.

1382
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,600
Twenty-five feet.

1383
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,200
He's a big boy. You're gonna have
to take him from behind.

1384
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,120
Twenty.

1385
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,720
Fifteen.
Movin' to your left.

1386
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,280
Ten feet.
Right behind ya.

1387
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,120
He's turned around.

1388
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,600
- You want me to do it?
- Negative.

1389
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,600
I'll do what I have to do,
but it's my call.

1390
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,800
Here he comes.

1391
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,840
Eight feet.
Six.

1392
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,480
- He's got ya. I'm taking him.
- No.

1393
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,480
Fuck!

1394
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,960
Clear out. Get back to the beach.

1395
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,960
Go! Go!

1396
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:26,000
That's the Chief.

1397
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,880
Chaser, this is Chaser Alpha.
Do you read me?

1398
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,800
Chaser, this is Chaser Alpha.
Do you read me?

1399
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,400
- Comm to Chaser. Do you got 'em?
- Copy that, Chaser.

1400
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,760
This is your lucky day, L.T.
Stand by, Chaser.

1401
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,680
Hostile activity,
this location.

1402
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,680
I say again, this location too hot.

1403
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:52,480
Request you advise coordinates
for new extract.

1404
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,640
- Over.
- O'Neil, slow down. Slow down.

1405
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,560
Chaser Alpha,
loud and clear.

1406
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,680
Will relay your traffic
to Las Vegas control. Over.

1407
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,960
Also request gunship support
for extraction.

1408
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,840
Location to follow.
Over.

1409
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,600
Roger that, Chaser
Alpha. Will relay priority to Las Vegas.

1410
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,520
Give me the coordinates when
you got 'em. We're outta here, guys.

1411
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,600
We gotta get those boats
out to sea.

1412
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:15,520
If we don't get those boats back
to the extract site, wherever that is,

1413
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,400
Scorpion's mission goes down.

1414
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,000
Leave one boat with my team.
I'll wait for the Chief.

1415
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,320
RPG's.
He's fucked.

1416
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,600
Sounds like Chief's
running a little late.

1417
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,760
We gotta go. O'Neil, retrace
your tracks. Cortez, pick up the rear.

1418
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,440
- We're going back in there for body parts?
- You're damn right we are.

1419
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,160
Do the headwork with me.

1420
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,880
If he's on the run, he's not coming back
this way to lead them to us.

1421
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:49,160
Right?
Now look here.

1422
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,640
If we're here,
and I left the Chief here,

1423
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,560
I think he's gonna
make his way southwest,

1424
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,120
down this wash
and out to sea.

1425
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,120
If we hump it, we can get there
and knock out any pursuit.

1426
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,400
You work this out with the Chief
ahead of time, O'Neil,

1427
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,520
or are you just clairvoyant?

1428
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,520
No, but it's what I'd do.

1429
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,240
I don't know. It sounds
like a fucking crapshoot.

1430
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:13,440
- Hash.
- What's up?

1431
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,360
Take three boats, wait for
new extraction location from Las Vegas.

1432
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,200
- Roger that.
- The rest, we're gonna stay, make sure the Chief gets out.

1433
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,560
This is Las Vegas.
Message to follow.

1434
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:48,360
New extract at 0-2-6-7-5-2.

1435
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,200
I say again,
0-2-6-7-5-2.

1436
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,480
- Over.
- Copy, Las Vegas.

1437
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,760
But those boats will be there
this time, correct? Over.

1438
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,640
That's a roger.
Sorry for the last.

1439
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:07,320
It won't happen again.
This is Las Vegas, out.

1440
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,240
Yeah, Scorpion, out.

1441
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,920
Let's go.

1442
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,560
Here?

1443
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,840
I think it's perfect for a parallel
ambush. We can suck them right in.

1444
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,560
Yeah. Let's do it.

1445
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,680
Wickwire.
Come in, Wickwire.

1446
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,480
What ya got, Cortez?

1447
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,600
Nothin'.

1448
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:40,640
O'Neil, it's Wick.

1449
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:44,800
- Can you read my mind? What do you think?
- I don't see any other way.

1450
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,320
There was foliage back to the south that
was good cover, but that's high ground.

1451
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:50,920
I think he'd
just be trapped.

1452
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,760
I don't know, Wick. Shit.

1453
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,040
Well, I see the Chief, and he's got
a boatload of trouble comin' our way.

1454
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:04,160
Boys, let's get ready
to rock and roll.

1455
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:17,000
Hold it, guys. Don't get trigger happy.
I got him at 30 yards.

1456
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,320
Keep comin', baby.
Keep comin'.

1457
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,440
Come on.

1458
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,120
Twenty yards. Come on, Chief. We're
suckin' 'em-We're suckin' 'em in.

1459
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:29,240
Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

1460
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,840
- He's hit! He's down!
- He's hit! Gotta blow it now!

1461
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,720
Negative, Slovnik.
He's in the kill zone.

1462
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,400
Las Vegas, this is Chaser Alpha.
We have heavy, hostile-

1463
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:45,480
Repeat, immediate extraction.

1464
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,480
He's hit again!

1465
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,000
Fire, fire!
Fire, fire! Cover him!

1466
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,680
Fire, fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire, fire!

1467
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,160
This is Chaser Alpha
to Las Vegas! Come in!

1468
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:03,240
- McCool, I'm going in!
- Shit! Wick, give her some cover!

1469
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,600
- Yah-hoo!
- She made it!

1470
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,960
Come on, come on,
come on!

1471
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,480
Got ya!

1472
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,160
Got ya!

1473
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:34,040
McCool!

1474
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,600
Newberry, give me smoke!
Get him out of here!

1475
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:39,640
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

1476
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:42,560
Stay down!
Stay down!

1477
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:50,720
That's it! Let's fall back!
Fall back! We're finished.

1478
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,680
- Your guys?
- Sounds like the right area.

1479
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:28,520
Christ!

1480
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,920
- Over here! Move, move, move!
- Give me a hand!

1481
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,040
Let's go! Let's go!
Take the airwaves! Stay down, Chief!

1482
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:01,000
- Break it off!
- Come on! Get in there!

1483
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,240
- Four heartbeat!
- Push it! Push it! Push it!

1484
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:07,840
- Six heartbeat!
- I'm looking for an I.V.

1485
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,000
I'm trying to find an I.V. here.

1486
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,040
He's alive!
Give me some room!

1487
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,440
- Slovnik, give me some room!
- All aboard!

1488
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,840
All bodies in!
Let's get the hell out of Dodge!

1489
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:35,720
- What a goat fuck.
- How's the Chief doin'?

1490
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,600
He's all right.

1491
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:48,120
Hey, O'Neil! I'd go to war
with you any day.

1492
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:55,480
I'll never live
this one down.

1493
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:58,160
Tango-Niner, are you
boys en route with cargo? Over.

1494
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,080
Sundown, this is Team Leader.

1495
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,000
We have the cargo
safely in hand,

1496
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:04,720
and just tell whoever's listening
that we're coming home.

1497
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,600
Tango-Niner out.

1498
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,560
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1499
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,880
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1500
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,440
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1501
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,240
- Welcome aboard, Sergeant.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

1502
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,600
Welcome aboard, sir.

1503
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,880
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

1504
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,280
Welcome to the SEALS
C.R.T. selection program.

1505
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:15,040
You have volunteered for the most
intensive military training known to man.

1506
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,240
Attention!

1507
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:20,880
I now turn you over
to my Command Master Chief...

1508
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,080
John James Urgayle.

1509
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:33,640
I never saw
a wild thing sorry for itself.

1510
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,120
A bird will fall
frozen dead from a bough...

1511
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:44,280
without ever having
felt sorry for itself.

1512
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,400
Boat crews,
stand by your boats!

1513
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:49,960
Move your asses!
