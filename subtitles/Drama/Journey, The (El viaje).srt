1
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:35,745
Humans?

2
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:36,996
So tiny!

3
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,626
Why poke my foot?

4
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,213
Monk Tang, over here!

5
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:45,964
Monk Tang.

6
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,257
Over here!

7
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,385
You've been asleep for ages.

8
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,887
We wanted to wake you...

9
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,889
We have good news...

10
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,225
Sorry.

11
00:00:58,518 --> 00:00:59,394
Sorry.

12
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,520
Sorry.

13
00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:04,023
Monk Tang, we have great news to tell you.

14
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,818
Congratulations!

15
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,236
You're in the place...

16
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:11,030
...you've always dreamed of.

17
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:12,114
This is India?

18
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,616
Correct!

19
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,577
India

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,538
I've reached my destination at last.

21
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:20,832
Sorry.

22
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:26,629
Master.

23
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:31,718
You've shrunk too?

24
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:41,769
Master, why are you in India too?

25
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:45,106
Monk Tang, you haven't let me down.

26
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,774
You wanted 22 sutras.

27
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:50,403
They're loaded on 10 horse carts.

28
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,904
They're yours if you want them.

29
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,990
Help yourself.

30
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,076
But the main reason I'm here today...

31
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,162
...is to give you an award.

32
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,246
What award?

33
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,415
For living this long.

34
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,761
Try it on.

35
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,847
What an honor.

36
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,517
I like it.

37
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,227
Discreet or bold...

38
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,063
You control it.

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,399
The right side is brighter, you see?

40
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,736
You can even it up.

41
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,738
May we ask for a few words?

42
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,198
I need to think about it.

43
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,410
Master!

44
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,745
What... is going on?

45
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,538
Have fun!

46
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,105
Monk! Pay your way...

47
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,548
...or the boss will throw you out.

48
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,400
I know.

49
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,948
Blindfold knife-throwing!
Amazing physical feats!

50
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,410
Roll up, roll up! Don't miss this!

51
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,378
Our guest stars are travelers heading west...

52
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,922
The pig, the fish and the monkey.

53
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,341
Greatest show on earth.

54
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,470
Only two cents per person.

55
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:41,347
How about half price?

56
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,890
Buy one, get one free?

57
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,350
It's a deal.

58
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:45,560
Thank you.

59
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,937
Show time.

60
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,315
The gorgeous... Pigsy!

61
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,775
Woman...

62
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,656
What's your name? Your age?

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,949
Crazy!

64
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,367
The great fish monster...

65
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,661
...Sandy!

66
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,342
How dare you scare my kid! Shame on you!

67
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,010
Money back!

68
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,138
Money back?

69
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,848
Making me angry?

70
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,392
Money back!

71
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,188
Give us another chance!

72
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,105
We have more to show you.

73
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:32,189
Give us another chance!

74
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:33,983
If we don't like 'em...

75
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,068
You pay everyone back double!

76
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,571
All right.

77
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,200
His Excellency... The Monkey King!

78
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,292
Fake! Money back!

79
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,629
Monkey, do some somersaults!

80
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,547
Paying back double will clean us out!

81
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,520
All right...

82
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,873
Your generosity will
keep us fed for several days.

83
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,065
Take it back.

84
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,859
Boss, this monk cheats!

85
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,821
He can't pay us back! Throw him out!

86
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,114
You're a disgrace to my circus! Scram!

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,578
Boss, we're not circus people.

88
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:29,038
We are Buddhist monks.

89
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:31,582
Our road is long and hard, we are hungry.

90
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,584
And I'm sick!

91
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,337
My body aches.

92
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,006
It's been days since I last ate.

93
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,175
So pitiful? Come...

94
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,428
These two buns...

95
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,680
...are for righteous men.

96
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,765
Men who deserve help.

97
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,267
Are you worthy?

98
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,370
We're really from the Great Tang Dynasty.

99
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,271
We conquer demons.

100
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,692
Monkey, show them your skills.

101
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,917
Hit me.

102
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,086
Hit me

103
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:18,629
I can't do that, Brother Monkey

104
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,215
I'm not suicidal.

105
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,509
Shall I hit you then?

106
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,887
I'd like that even less, Brother Monkey.

107
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,139
Fine, you only live once, I'll hit you.

108
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,061
Brother, you're hard as a rock!

109
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,355
It's <i>as</i> if my whole arm is shattered!

110
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,858
Pretty boy, have you no shame?

111
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:40,794
Watch some more before you complain.

112
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,361
And stop poking me

113
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,445
I need to.

114
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,118
Hit me... Master wants us to perform

115
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,495
I'm hungry, I have no strength.

116
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,247
Again.

117
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,250
That's no excuse for shirking.

118
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,710
Hit me, stupid!

119
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,479
I've heard there are
fake demon-vanquishers around.

120
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:02,131
They've left many people hurt.

121
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,382
You must be the ones!

122
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,134
Yes, we're guilty.

123
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,179
The problem is that my disciples are too strong.

124
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,181
Sure, you just keep on bragging...

125
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,196
One blow is enough.

126
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:26,781
Stop now.

127
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,038
That'll do for now.

128
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,000
You're so desirable!

129
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:39,669
Let me stoke your fires a little.

130
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,713
No! Get off me!

131
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,757
Monkey, don't just squat there.

132
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,258
Do something about it!

133
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,834
I'm so sorry, that's really all from us.

134
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,544
No charge for what you've just seen.

135
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,627
Great sir.

136
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,048
Your performance is more than impressive.

137
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,926
Say no more, try this candied fruit.

138
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,386
Let us be brothers.

139
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,973
Brother, now you've seen what they can do

140
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,933
I wish they could control themselves better.

141
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,562
We really do conquer demons.

142
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,645
Of course you do.

143
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,025
Monkey, come and apologize.

144
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,659
Pick up your head-band.

145
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:58,873
Put it on.

146
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,293
Wear it properly now

147
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:04,628
I'm doing it.

148
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,340
You talk while chewing a twig? Bad monkey!

149
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,470
I won't if you don't like it.

150
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,641
But stop calling me 'Bad monkey'!

151
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,478
I can call you that if I want to.

152
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,228
Bad monkey.

153
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,605
Bad monkey.

154
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,981
Great!

155
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:27,026
Say it just one more time...

156
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,486
I'm scared.

157
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,654
It's horrible! Makes me so scared!

158
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:32,281
Aren't you all afraid?

159
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,249
Even if he throws tantrums.

160
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,001
You can't be lenient.

161
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,878
Let's all scold him together

162
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,963
1, 2, 3...

163
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,758
Bad monkey!

164
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:57,014
"My boy, my boy..."

165
00:09:57,098 --> 00:10:00,309
"Why are you so bad?"

166
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,603
"Bullying, cheating..."

167
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,023
"Why make me so sad?"

168
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,234
"Learn to be a good boy."

169
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,694
"Learn to love."

170
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,406
"Care for others."

171
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,367
"Fill your heart with color"

172
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,703
<i>“My good boy...“</i>

173
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:23,290
"Hurry back to me."

174
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,543
"My embrace..."

175
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,714
<i>“My good boy...“</i>

176
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,884
"Be sincere."

177
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:38,305
"You're the one I love most."

178
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,153
Master, ours is just a small enterprise.

179
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,905
What you see is all we have.

180
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,366
If it's not enough for you...

181
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,785
...then all we can is offer our lives.

182
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,162
<i>Stop.</i>

183
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,124
First, I'm not here to extort anything from you.

184
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,625
Second...

185
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,086
Never mind, I won't say it.

186
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:12,358
JOURNEY TO THE WEST:
THE DEMONS STRIKE BACK

187
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,746
When did your mother...

188
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:26,956
...start behaving like this?

189
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,666
A few days ago

190
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,167
I don't know why.

191
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,002
Soon after we moved here...

192
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,462
...she began talking nonsense.

193
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,174
If I approach her...

194
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:41,053
...she scratches me like a mad thing.

195
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,847
I have no idea why she's like this

196
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,141
I'm completely exhausted.

197
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,394
Luckily my two daughters...

198
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,521
...help me take care of my mother.

199
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,566
It wears them out.

200
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,860
They're your daughters?

201
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,279
God-daughters.

202
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,738
How old are they?

203
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:00,864
They just turned sixteen.

204
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,575
They look a little haggard.

205
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,161
They've been working too hard.

206
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,746
They were radiant before.

207
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,331
How horrible!

208
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,209
Grandma, have some congee.

209
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,129
You haven't eaten all day.

210
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,006
Another fit?

211
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,010
Ma, are you all right?

212
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:24,221
Ma, Ma, Ma...

213
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,099
It's me... Calm down.

214
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,564
Quick! The exorcism mirror!

215
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,647
Coming right up!

216
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,501
Ten thousand gods send down thunderbolts...

217
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,569
...to reveal the hidden demons!

218
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,071
Show yourself!

219
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,661
All demons, be revealed!

220
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,586
Nothing?

221
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,840
But the whole room smells foul.

222
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,468
If it's not her body, then...

223
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,179
...maybe she has second sight.

224
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,848
She sees the demons in others.

225
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,767
That's why she's so scared.

226
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,853
Could it be those two?

227
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,275
I've put up with them for too long.

228
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,402
All demons, be revealed!

229
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,575
Too bright! I can't see anything!

230
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,410
What? Not them either.

231
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,914
Could it be...

232
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,342
A hairy crab!

233
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,982
You bad monkey!

234
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,320
You bad monkey!

235
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,410
Bad monkey!

236
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,082
Look at that.

237
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,543
Master's whip is really strong today.

238
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,004
That whip has kept Monkey
under control for 500 years.

239
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,714
It needs to be strong.

240
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,665
You knew those two were shape-shifters.

241
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,400
Why didn't you stop them?

242
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,110
You asked me to perform.

243
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,278
Sol did.

244
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,696
And what did you perform?

245
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,048
I asked for a couple of somersaults.

246
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,699
And you destroyed a family!

247
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,243
Then you shouldn't have called me "Bad monkey".

248
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,788
You know that makes me go berserk

249
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,624
I didn't mean to call you that.

250
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,126
Everyone knows I don't mean it.

251
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,919
Such a small thing and you try to kill me?

252
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,003
Such ruthless.

253
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,214
Open your mouth!

254
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:08,802
Wider! You want my life.

255
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,434
Now I'm offering you my life.

256
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,811
Bite! You're a coward if you don't.

257
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,148
Hey, something to see here!

258
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,608
Bite!

259
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,775
Do it.

260
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:29,854
Why did you treat me like that?

261
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,118
Speak! Say something!

262
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,285
Why do you keep doing it?

263
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,622
Cheating me! Provoking me!

264
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,292
Hurting me! Torturing me! Mistreating me!

265
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,796
It seems our days of conquering demons...

266
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,926
...have come to an end.

267
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,514
Let's disband.

268
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,140
"Disband"?

269
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,644
Does "disband" mean he wants to kill us?

270
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:00,729
Master!

271
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,276
I understand why Master does these things.

272
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,904
But please drink this medicine first.

273
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,365
From now on... I'll be obedient.

274
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:16,578
What are you saying? I'm not punishing you.

275
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,832
Master, you surely know...

276
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,336
My brothers and I... We are all of one heart.

277
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,214
If you punish Brother Monkey...
Then my heart aches too.

278
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,297
And my heart...

279
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,093
...is really aching.

280
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,473
That's so true.

281
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:37,266
When I hit you.

282
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,350
My heart really aches.

283
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,993
Master, try it if you don't believe us.

284
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,356
When I punish you...

285
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,526
I suffer heartache too.

286
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,242
If I'd set off to find the sutras on my own...

287
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,738
I'd have got there long ago.

288
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,008
Having you with me doesn't help at all

289
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,493
I can subdue one hundred foes...

290
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:57,578
...single-handed.

291
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,741
Do I need to tell you this?

292
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,165
I've mastered Buddha's Palm.

293
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:03,750
Do I really need to tell you this?

294
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,713
So it's not that
you're helping me to find the sutras

295
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,716
I'm helping you
to make merit and learn Buddhism.

296
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,884
Do I make myself crystal clear?

297
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,344
Do you get it?

298
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:15,971
Yes, we do.

299
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,394
That's enough for now.

300
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,896
Go to bed, we've got much to do tomorrow.

301
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,409
"Sinful monkey!"

302
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,454
<i>"I'll</i> show you my Buddha's Palm!"

303
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,117
Did you miss me?

304
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,331
He's even teasing Brother Monkey.

305
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,174
Master's mind has reached such a high level.

306
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,211
That's not Brother Monkey he's embracing.

307
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,296
It's someone else.

308
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,644
Amitabha, Amitabha.

309
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,813
Master, you seemed happy last night.

310
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,565
We were happy to see you happy.

311
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,943
But we won't tell on you.

312
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,570
What are you on about?

313
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:56,947
No water left.

314
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,699
Second Brother, fetch some water.

315
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,243
Why do I have to do it?

316
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,327
How did you come up...

317
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,537
...up with that idea?

318
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,622
Stop quarreling, <i>I'll</i> go.

319
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,512
Alms giver, excuse me...

320
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,513
I was just passing.

321
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,598
May I trouble you for water to boil rice?

322
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,935
There's no need for that.

323
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,062
You're welcome to eat here

324
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,856
I'm vegetarian.

325
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,691
What luck!

326
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,694
We're having vegetarian food.

327
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,797
We're devout too, we share the same path.

328
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,656
It's natural for us to share our meal.

329
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,367
And you can stay after eating.

330
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,454
We'll be able to compare notes.

331
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,666
He's ill, won't he taste bad?

332
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,961
Never mind, we can heal him first.

333
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,088
It would be impolite to refuse.

334
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,300
No need to cook come and eat here.

335
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,135
What about my congee?

336
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,012
I prepared it this morning.

337
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,390
Your congee will be burnt.

338
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:07,225
Go back and watch the fire.

339
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,794
Alms giver, your medicine works a treat

340
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,921
I feel better already.

341
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,381
These three are my delinquent disciples.

342
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,488
Nice to meet you.

343
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,199
Nice to meet you.

344
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,283
Nice to meet you.

345
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,703
Nice to meet you.

346
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,208
Don't flirt.

347
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,379
Nice to meet you.

348
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,589
To hell with that, what's nice about it?

349
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,883
Sandy, what are you saying?

350
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,677
I was cooking congee.

351
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,303
What are you up to?

352
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,513
"Nice, nice, nice..."

353
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,348
What do you all think you're doing?

354
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,017
I'm sorry, my disciple is a touch simple-minded.

355
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,435
It doesn't matter.

356
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,020
May I just ask you...

357
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,106
Are there any demons here?

358
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,525
Master, please don't scare me.

359
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,943
Why would there be demons here?

360
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,736
You're going too far.

361
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,073
Why ask such a question?

362
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,659
Actually...

363
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,703
We conquer demons.

364
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,539
I did wonder... Really?

365
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,374
You've been so hospitable...

366
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,876
But we have nothing to repay it.

367
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,211
All I can offer is a one-off exorcism.

368
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,673
Really? You're terribly kind...

369
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,884
But, sad to say...

370
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,886
There are no demons here.

371
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,140
See my face?

372
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:11,724
Hit me.

373
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,436
Come on, quick!

374
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,188
If you don't, <i>I'll</i> beat you to death.

375
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:19,357
Really?

376
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,984
Why?

377
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,575
I told you to hit me, scum

378
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,577
I'll ask you again.

379
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:34,372
Hit me, you asshole!

380
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,210
Have you lost it again?

381
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,712
I'm not an asshole.

382
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,964
You definitely are.

383
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,050
But I was calling her an asshole, not you.

384
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,551
Damn you!

385
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,470
You assholes take me as your Master?

386
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,553
Clear out of here.

387
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,431
Clear out of here.

388
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,015
Sorry about that.

389
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,477
Get out, all of you.

390
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,354
She kindly invited us to eat.

391
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,774
You bang her table and ask her to hit you.

392
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,067
And call her an asshole.

393
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,902
Go and face the wall.

394
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,778
Contemplate what you've done.

395
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,489
What have you ever contributed to society?

396
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,367
Don't come back until you figure it out.

397
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:22,671
Come back!

398
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,607
Master, we haven't figured it out yet.

399
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:25,882
Don't give it any more thought.

400
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,132
Come back!

401
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,761
Still contemplating it.

402
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,513
She's caught me!

403
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,338
Rake.

404
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,719
Up, up!

405
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,803
Up, up!

406
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,763
Quick, up!

407
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,687
You can stop now.

408
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,215
Master, time to show your hand.

409
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,135
You're so kind.

410
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,155
Beauty!

411
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,617
Such long legs...

412
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,118
- What're you doing?
- I like them

413
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,335
I'm a spider!

414
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,337
You must be kidding!

415
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,215
I'm just a pig.

416
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,799
I wasn't kidding.

417
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:41,142
Your resistance makes me stronger.

418
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,316
Don't go, I am talking to you!

419
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,678
What's that noise?

420
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,680
Don't worry, it's Sandy

421
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,308
Sandy, are you all right?

422
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,895
A bit poisoned, a bit dazed.

423
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,737
Seems like time for me to step in now.

424
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,448
Conquering demons takes sincerity.

425
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,158
Lead them to benevolence.

426
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:22,243
No violence necessary.

427
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:29,959
"Without a knife, a butcher can be a Buddha."

428
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,120
Stop!

429
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,039
Monkey...

430
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,874
You are too rude.

431
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,518
Only a coolie needs to use such strength.

432
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,542
Go away.

433
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:13,795
Let me handle this.

434
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,762
Brother Monkey, be more gentle

435
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,597
I've only just got started with her.

436
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,724
She has such long legs.

437
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,892
A rare species though.

438
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:28,976
Quiet.

439
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,273
Let go.

440
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,720
All done, Master.

441
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,140
What?

442
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,684
You finished her before I had a chance.

443
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,060
What were you thinking?

444
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,147
What, don't you know you were in great danger?

445
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,566
She coulda swallowed you whole.

446
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,234
You're lucky I strike fast

447
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,336
I took her out with one blow.

448
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,487
How many times have I told you?

449
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:23,197
To conquer a demon, educate it.

450
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,366
Didn't you see the smile on her face just now?

451
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,660
Smile?

452
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,384
She smiled at the prospect of eating you.

453
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:30,913
Outrageous!

454
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,249
That smile was so sincere.

455
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:36,961
My smile is even more sincere.

456
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,296
Guess: do I love you?

457
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,964
Or will I kill you?

458
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,431
Who the hell are you?

459
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,141
How can I help you?

460
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,075
Did you see that? He's so handsome.

461
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:09,660
You're almost better-looking than me.

462
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,412
You know that?

463
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,956
Of course, you can't stand it?

464
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:14,749
Can you?

465
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,834
Of course not, how about you?

466
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,754
What's Baldy doing up there?

467
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:20,963
Thinking.

468
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,090
About what?

469
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,549
About Miss Duan.

470
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,060
I don't care who he's thinking about.

471
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,980
I can overlook
this baldy's propensity for violence.

472
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,649
But he's started going too far.

473
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,819
Lying beside me, swaying and fondling...

474
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,488
Asking if I miss him...

475
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,949
Just thinking of it gives me goosebumps.

476
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,826
Well, that needs to stop.

477
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,411
Why not just kill him?

478
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,247
Forget it.

479
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,167
You always dance to Baldy's tune.

480
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,752
You can do nothing

481
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,379
I'll pull out his tongue...

482
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,380
...and tie it in a knot!

483
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:04,674
What kind of tune would he sing then?

484
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:08,094
He still knows the Buddha's Palm technique

485
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,387
I'm not scared.

486
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,472
If I break his arm...

487
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:13,307
...how can use Buddha's sodding Palm?

488
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,400
Master, how long have you been standing there?

489
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,111
Just now

490
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,696
I came to see how you're doing.

491
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,656
Don't worry, I heard nothing.

492
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,201
Master...

493
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,078
How come you lost your voice?

494
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:35,955
I haven't.

495
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,038
Out here in the wild...

496
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,877
...we shouldn't disturb others by being loud.

497
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:42,503
Really?

498
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:43,754
For sure.

499
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,674
Have I ever... lied to you?

500
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,470
All right, you all relax,
I'll just relieve myself

501
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,780
Buddha, Buddha.

502
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,991
My three disciples are unruly

503
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,701
I have failed to teach them well

504
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,745
I know three hundred songs for children.

505
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:16,996
But nothing else

506
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,916
I've been pretending to be capable.

507
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,335
How can I go on like this?

508
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,587
Now they are plotting to kill me.

509
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,923
And I've lost my singing voice.

510
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,966
Be merciful, Buddha.

511
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,178
Teach me your holy Buddha's Palm.

512
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,805
Your follower will be forever grateful.

513
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,646
I beg you, please

514
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:46,400
Buddha, do your hear me?

515
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,362
Give me a sign please.

516
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,989
Even a little fart would do...

517
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:04,001
Pigsy, how long have you been there?

518
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,796
Not long, I didn't see what you were doing.

519
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,631
Don't worry, I didn't hear anything either

520
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,636
I've been good to you.

521
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,805
You know what you should do.

522
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:18,432
What should I do?

523
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,393
All I can do is be myself.

524
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,728
What I was getting at is...

525
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,815
"Silence is golden."

526
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,901
Master, all I did was break wind.

527
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,820
But all your threats and pressures...

528
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,447
...weigh on me heavily.

529
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,409
So that's your game.

530
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,578
You should watch out

531
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,079
I know where your family is.

532
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:41,289
Understood.

533
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,135
Monkey, what are you doing?

534
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,849
You're the one who needs to watch out

535
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,642
I'd like to experience...

536
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,936
...my Master's holy Buddha's Palm.

537
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,647
What are you talking about?

538
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:08,774
You didn't get it?

539
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,486
I want to compare strength with you.

540
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,826
You run?

541
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:36,677
"My boy, my boy."

542
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:40,306
"Why are you so naughty?"

543
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,974
"Bullying, cheating..."

544
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:44,101
"Why behave that way?"

545
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,229
"Learn to behave better."

546
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:49,106
"Closeness, love."

547
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:51,192
"Be tender in your heart."

548
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:53,527
Damn Baldy, enough with the singing.

549
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,112
Fight me!

550
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,449
"Good child..."

551
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,642
Where can you run to?

552
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,353
All right.

553
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,523
If that's what you really want,
I'll indulge you.

554
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:33,818
So it's clobbering time.

555
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:35,528
Wait, give me a moment.

556
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,882
I was just toying with you, Master.

557
00:36:56,966 --> 00:37:00,052
Just working up a sweat.

558
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,474
You scared me to death.

559
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,786
What on earth are you up to now?

560
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,163
None of your business.

561
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,498
You're so handsome, you've gone bald...

562
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:30,666
Do you mean that?

563
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,461
I'd be a pig if I lied.

564
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:39,300
How did it go?

565
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,218
Did you tear Baldy to shreds?

566
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,179
Was his blood running everywhere?

567
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,100
Wait, have you really killed him?

568
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,020
You tricked me.

569
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,335
Pigsy, have you learnt
what "Silence is golden" means?

570
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,587
I just did.

571
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,266
Now you're poisoned, I have to pull you.

572
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,699
Will you please stop dousing me?

573
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,536
I caught a cold, my nose is runny.

574
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,875
Caught a cold? Bullshit! You'd better die now.

575
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,285
Less trouble for me that way.

576
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,128
Monkey...

577
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,424
When do you think
Sandy will turn back into a man?

578
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:06,512
No idea, I have never paid attention to that.

579
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,739
Master, you really want to know?

580
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:08,556
Maybe...

581
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,890
...not.

582
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,477
"Bi-Qiu Kingdom."

583
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,028
The Minister is here.

584
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,531
Hail, your eminence.

585
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:25,549
Master Tang is an eminent monk indeed.

586
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,259
His bearing is graceful.

587
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:32,014
My admiration is heartfelt.

588
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:47,982
It's a pleasure to meet you.

589
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,199
May I ask how your eminence knew I was coming?

590
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:52,242
I am flattered...

591
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,329
Most flattered.

592
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,706
Master Tang's reputation precedes him.

593
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,084
And your three brilliant companions...

594
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,211
...are also awe-inspiring

595
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,004
I learned that the four of you...

596
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:05,881
...would pass by here.

597
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:09,259
The king sent me to greet you here.

598
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,887
Let's go to the palace.

599
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:17,059
We can chat there.

600
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,774
Neat trick.

601
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,028
It's just a trifle.

602
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,201
Don't play any more tricks.

603
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,829
It wasn't me, I didn't do anything.

604
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,122
What did I do?

605
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,172
Bloom.

606
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,590
Hey presto.

607
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:52,636
Your eminence...

608
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,014
There's something which puzzles me for a while.

609
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:57,057
Are your magic tricks...

610
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,226
...intended to seem fake?

611
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:03,397
Master, we both know that in this world...

612
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,774
...magic tricks are illusions.

613
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:09,778
Why care whether they seem real or fake?

614
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:11,196
Let's go.

615
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:19,329
Cultivating oneself
is different from playing tricks.

616
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:20,914
The crucial thing...

617
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,374
...is what's in the heart.

618
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,167
Master...

619
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,546
You are bottling something up.

620
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,923
What's on your mind?

621
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:34,720
There's someone in your heart,
you yearn for her.

622
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:37,139
You can't forget her

623
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,309
I'm afraid you're wrong, there's not.

624
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,560
Learning humanity...

625
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,187
...is like having religious faith.

626
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:48,442
Following your heart will keep you young.

627
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:52,446
A person who can't be honest with himself...

628
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,573
...is hypocritical.

629
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,951
That's why I cultivate myself...

630
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,995
...according to my heart's desires.

631
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:04,833
So what 'cultivation' means to you is...

632
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,753
Doing what I damn well like.

633
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,225
What are they kneeling for?

634
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:24,686
It's a game, losers have to kneel.

635
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,606
The king has lately taken rejuvenation pills.

636
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,316
Now he behaves like a child.

637
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:33,403
It's as if he took my counsel
about following his heart.

638
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,574
The king is easily coaxed.

639
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,119
Simply fawn on him and you'll be well rewarded

640
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:44,581
I'll expect my cut, of course.

641
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,000
Let's split it by 50/50, ok?

642
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,336
That's...

643
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,713
I'm just joking,
you didn't think I was serious?

644
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,301
Look, our beauties are greeting you.

645
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:00,806
Impressive, I like it.

646
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:08,772
Your Majesty...

647
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:10,440
Honorable guests are here

648
00:44:10,524 --> 00:44:11,525
I am Tang

649
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:12,669
I am crossing your great country.

650
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,070
My three disciples and I
are here to pay our respects.

651
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,573
<i>Hug, hug.</i>

652
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,537
Splendid.

653
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,166
Look, this king is sillier than our Master.

654
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:28,375
No way.

655
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,211
No-one is sillier than our Master.

656
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,676
<i>Hug, hug.</i>

657
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:41,054
Please respond in kind
to the king's high protocol.

658
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,392
Too late, he's too stuck-up.

659
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,187
Here.

660
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,196
I hear that you conquer demons.

661
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:59,156
It's true.

662
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:01,867
Don't believe it, show me some tricks.

663
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,454
I think Your Majesty is confused.

664
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:07,664
Conquering demons is not an acrobatic trick.

665
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:11,001
You will do as I order.

666
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,128
You will speak... as I order.

667
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,504
If you don't obey.

668
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,465
You insult my dignity.

669
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,155
Now <i>I'll</i> have your head chopped off.

670
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:19,718
And hand it on the door.

671
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,721
Great, this king has brilliant ideas.

672
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,847
My kind of king.

673
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:24,931
Men.

674
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,015
Off with his head!

675
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:29,019
Don't worry...

676
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,439
Really, Minister?

677
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:33,690
It's a joke

678
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,275
I see...

679
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,277
It doesn't seem so.

680
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:38,570
Doesn't seem what?

681
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,032
Your Majesty.

682
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,201
We can perform a bit for you.

683
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:47,371
Monkey, show His Majesty a few tricks.

684
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:50,791
You ask a nobody to entertain me?

685
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,584
That's a deliberate insult!

686
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:53,794
Death penalty!

687
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,129
Your Majesty, I must show you my tricks.

688
00:45:56,213 --> 00:45:58,048
Don't try to talk me out of it, <i>I'll</i> do it.

689
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,009
Just give me a moment and I'll be with you.

690
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,971
Get a move on.

691
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,807
Master, are you really going to perform?

692
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,393
Do I have any choice?

693
00:46:17,985 --> 00:46:19,278
He can't get through.

694
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:21,488
What should we do?

695
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:24,491
No big deal, just show them your Buddha's Palm.

696
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,660
It's not a parlor trick.

697
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:28,651
How about I take Master's form?

698
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,184
I can perform something for the king.

699
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,500
You just want to have your way with the maids.

700
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,002
Go now if you have the guts.

701
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,048
Stone, paper, scissors.

702
00:46:40,132 --> 00:46:41,383
Stone, paper, scissors.

703
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,720
I know what...

704
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,086
Use the talisman of obedience.

705
00:46:46,555 --> 00:46:48,557
That again? That's an old idea.

706
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:50,684
New ideas are thin on the ground, boss.

707
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,769
It will have to do.

708
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,146
Stick it on him...

709
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:55,939
And he'll do whatever I do.

710
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,233
Identical movements.

711
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,405
Damn it, chop him up

712
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:49,076
I'd be doomed if you do striptease again

713
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,202
I'm not going to do this.

714
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,285
You don't trust me.

715
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:53,037
I don't

716
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:57,042
I'm sincerely trying to help.

717
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,419
And you really don't trust me?

718
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,798
I don't.

719
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,675
If you find that something goes wrong
you can always stop me.

720
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,760
You won't cheat me?

721
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,805
I look like a cheat?

722
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,265
Have I ever cheated you?

723
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:13,767
More times than I can remember.

724
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,060
You're right.

725
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:16,853
You're an asshole.

726
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:32,952
Good.

727
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,383
Stop it.

728
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,181
Where is he?

729
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,892
You want to make me lose face again?

730
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:56,976
Move.

731
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,652
Out of the way...

732
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,413
Poor Master

733
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:17,914
I specialize in striptease.

734
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,958
Master isn't as good as I am.

735
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:23,879
Brother Monkey.

736
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,505
Where did he go?

737
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,218
<i>Stop.</i>

738
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,846
Don't stop.

739
00:49:34,264 --> 00:49:35,390
No stopping.

740
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:37,160
If you shout 'Stop' again, <i>I'll</i> have your head.

741
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,643
You are joking?

742
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,646
He's not joking.

743
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:44,065
If you shout 'Stop' again,
you'll lose your head.

744
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:45,817
Go on then.

745
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:01,291
Great! Any more tricks up your sleeve?

746
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,047
Go to hell.

747
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,548
"Go to hell."

748
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:11,593
Go to hell again!

749
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,094
"Go to hell again!"

750
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,644
He hit me.

751
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:23,980
He hit me!

752
00:50:28,151 --> 00:50:29,444
Hurry! Quick!

753
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:32,531
You must flee right away if the king cries.

754
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:47,295
Master, I did my best to help you.

755
00:50:47,671 --> 00:50:49,214
But after what just happened...

756
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,299
I'm afraid that...

757
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:56,304
Your reputation cannot be repaired.

758
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,390
Attendants.

759
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,101
Here's some expenses money.

760
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,145
Use it on your travels.

761
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,815
Don't show up here again for 8 to 10 years.

762
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,150
How can I accept, after all that...?

763
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:11,611
Don't mention it, I know it's hard for you.

764
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:13,780
Meetings are hard.

765
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,032
But partings are harder.

766
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,827
You and I may not meet again.

767
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:20,453
Take care.

768
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:21,705
Tang Tang.

769
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,628
The Minister fancies you.

770
00:51:28,712 --> 00:51:30,630
You have a good chance with her.

771
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:32,591
You always get so many dates, I envy you.

772
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:35,677
You're really charming, so it's understandable.

773
00:51:37,554 --> 00:51:38,847
You bad monkey!

774
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,640
How dare you say this to me?

775
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,809
I feared it might go wrong.

776
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,161
But I didn't expect to risk my life.

777
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,438
Now kneel to me

778
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:48,607
I'll beat you until you kneel.

779
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:49,816
Kneel.

780
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:50,942
Beat away.

781
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:54,154
Did you ever think how it feels
to demean yourself in front of people?

782
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,990
Now you know what crazy dancing feels like.

783
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,450
So you know how bad I feel.

784
00:51:58,533 --> 00:51:59,409
You always make me...

785
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,453
...kneel like a dog before you.

786
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,538
You know how shaming that is?

787
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:04,623
You're right

788
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:05,957
I did manipulate you.

789
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,767
So that you'd know how indignity feels.

790
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:12,631
I see.

791
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,133
Now that you've said all that...

792
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,611
I'll finish you off with one slap.

793
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:17,719
Go ahead!

794
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:18,970
I'm ready for it

795
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,014
I'd rather die than suffer this torture.

796
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,224
All I wanted was to tell you...

797
00:52:23,475 --> 00:52:25,894
"Do unto others as you'd wish them..."

798
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:27,646
"...to do unto you"

799
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,995
I'm sorry, I'm at fault.

800
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,584
Stop, don't try that on me.

801
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,631
You're right,
we should be considerate for each other

802
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,926
I've punished you by making you dance.

803
00:52:58,426 --> 00:52:59,946
By taking away your dignity in public.

804
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,765
Now I realize what a loss of dignity feels like.

805
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,058
How miserable it is

806
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:08,687
I've been wrong to call you 'bad Monkey'

807
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,481
I've beaten and scolded you all day long

808
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,651
I've been oblivious to your feelings.

809
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:20,156
The problem here is me.

810
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,740
Not you

811
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,119
I'm the one who spreads unhappiness.

812
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,746
Now I realize my mistakes.

813
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:29,249
Please forgive me this once.

814
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:32,085
Give me one more chance, forgive me.

815
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,256
Master's conscience is awakened at last.

816
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:40,385
Don't you see he's using
"Advance by retreating"?

817
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:42,470
To admit a mistake at the right time...

818
00:53:42,554 --> 00:53:44,180
...can win people's hearts.

819
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:47,016
You see, it worked so well on brother Monkey.

820
00:53:49,144 --> 00:53:50,687
Master often seems silly.

821
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,939
But he knows how to manage risk.

822
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:56,276
Master...

823
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,446
I guess I overdid it.

824
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:02,407
Please get up.

825
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:07,078
I actually care a lot for you

826
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,247
I just didn't know how to express it.

827
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,417
Master, I know in my heart...

828
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,002
...how you feel about me.

829
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:14,711
From now on, though...

830
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:16,713
Don't ever make me do crazy dancing.

831
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:18,286
But frankly speaking, Monkey...

832
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,924
You're good at it.

833
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,042
Don't even think that, Master.

834
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,093
Never again.

835
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:25,096
Please stop calling me 'Master'

836
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,223
We're sworn brothers for life.

837
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:30,143
So just call me 'Elder' from now on.

838
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:33,438
Elder...

839
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:36,775
Elder...

840
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:39,319
See how well it works?

841
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,489
They're all but kissing.

842
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,240
Impressive, no?

843
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,536
No entry to the palace, on pain of death.

844
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:51,039
Pardon us.

845
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,373
Master...

846
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,083
Why are you back?

847
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:55,919
Minister

848
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:58,004
I've been thinking

849
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,106
I need to restore my reputation

850
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,799
I can't leave things as they were.

851
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,302
Master, please get away while you still can.

852
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,262
If you come back, there'll be carnage.

853
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,057
Minister, I value my reputation.

854
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,059
How can I be a good monk with a bad rep?

855
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,111
How dare you return!

856
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,114
Your Majesty, please calm down.

857
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:27,367
Monk Tang has something to say.

858
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,535
Your Majesty.

859
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,429
What happened before had nothing to do with me.

860
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:32,789
It was all caused by my errant disciple.

861
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:35,083
So I've brought him to apologize to you.

862
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,918
And while we're about it...

863
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,545
We'll conquer a demon or two.

864
00:55:39,087 --> 00:55:40,129
Monkey...

865
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,183
Hit me.

866
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:54,936
Are you a pervert?

867
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,104
Brilliant.

868
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:59,440
A game is just the thing to appease the king.

869
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:00,859
Master Monkey...

870
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,861
Let me run through the rules of this game.

871
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:09,742
Master...

872
00:56:09,826 --> 00:56:12,579
Don't you think you're doing a bit too much?

873
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:24,465
You haven't eaten yet.

874
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,758
Can't you do it harder?

875
00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:27,176
Is that it?

876
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:57,457
Out of the way!

877
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:01,961
Danger!

878
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:35,912
Red Boy.

879
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,288
Monkey.

880
00:57:37,372 --> 00:57:38,998
You show your true face at last.

881
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,560
I saw from the start
there's something odd about you.

882
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,251
According to legend...

883
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,420
You own the long Firecloud Spear.

884
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:45,254
And move on...

885
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:47,548
The flaming Golden Wheel! Well met!

886
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:50,718
So you're the Monkey King...

887
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,387
...who has great strengths.

888
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,553
Show your senior...

889
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:54,847
...the best you can do.

890
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:23,542
Playing foul?

891
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,130
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

892
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,560
Master, over here.

893
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:36,157
Three-tier Fire!

894
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,159
Take that!

895
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:33,005
The palace...

896
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:35,758
It's in ruins.

897
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:40,096
Ruins...

898
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,140
Stupid monkey...

899
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:43,223
Don't hide!

900
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,226
Come out to face me.

901
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:20,655
My turn!

902
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,668
Help!

903
01:02:34,627 --> 01:02:35,962
Help!

904
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:37,964
What happened?

905
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:40,424
Was there an earthquake?

906
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,259
Your Majesty...

907
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,554
Wait.

908
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:48,557
Let me do it.

909
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,032
What a cute little monster

910
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,411
I've subdued it, keep it <i>as</i> a souvenir

911
01:03:08,494 --> 01:03:10,705
I will chant sutras day and night.

912
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:12,665
Until its evil nature is defeated

913
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,667
I'll do my best.

914
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:18,838
The king...

915
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,174
Your Majesty!

916
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:29,640
Thank you, your reverences.

917
01:03:29,724 --> 01:03:32,018
We have our real king back at last.

918
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:34,353
We've prepared lavish gifts for you.

919
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,604
See for yourselves.

920
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:51,579
The palace's 3000 beauties.

921
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,080
Choose which you like.

922
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:53,748
All for me?

923
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,709
Too few? You can have the throne too.

924
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:58,294
Calm down, Your Majesty.

925
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,838
His Majesty is offering...

926
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,549
Ladies-in-waiting for your journey.

927
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:04,633
So it is

928
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:06,635
I'm grateful for his generosity, but I...

929
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,599
You think we're the types
to accept such a gift?

930
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:10,473
Women make us seriously ill.

931
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:11,474
Put me in change of them...

932
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:13,267
And see how badly I treat them all.

933
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:15,061
Come on, the fish is getting very dry.

934
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:16,270
Put that to good use.

935
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:18,230
Your saliva smells bad.

936
01:04:18,314 --> 01:04:19,315
Don't be picky.

937
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:21,108
Better than nothing.

938
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,320
It's good to have someone for help.

939
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:25,821
- Please pick one or two - Yes.

940
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:29,408
Don't fight with me,
I'll handle them one by one.

941
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,994
If Your Majesty insists on repaying us...

942
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:33,278
Maybe I can suggest something?

943
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,706
Could you free these ladies?

944
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:36,874
Sure, no problem.

945
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,460
Anyone who wants to leave can leave.

946
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,588
No blame attached, you have my word.

947
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:44,673
Your Majesty, so...

948
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:45,549
I feel like crying.

949
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:48,094
All those women in my harem
are ugly-looking gluttons.

950
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,178
They eat really a lot.

951
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:52,932
They eat 7 meals a day, better send them away.

952
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,392
You can go, you're free.

953
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:55,559
Are you out of your mind?

954
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:56,560
Being imperial concubines is just fine.

955
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:57,728
Why would we want to leave?

956
01:04:57,812 --> 01:04:59,897
Damned bald monk, who do you think you are?

957
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,620
If you stir thing up, we'll sort you out!

958
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,192
You think we're vain?

959
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,778
Damn you, we're here for love!

960
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,780
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

961
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,241
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

962
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:12,743
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

963
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:14,662
Monk Tang, get out! Protect our love!

964
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:17,832
See how they love you?

965
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,668
I'll crush your balls

966
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,278
- I'm sorry...
- Sparing on effort!

967
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:25,256
Calm down, you can all stay.

968
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,053
I want to die.

969
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:39,311
That one...

970
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:41,188
You... You...

971
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:42,148
<i>- Me?
- Yes!</i>

972
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:45,151
The one in black behind you.

973
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:47,653
How come I've never seen you before?

974
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,447
This lady is a newcomer.

975
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,323
She's a songstress.

976
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:55,578
What's your name?

977
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:58,789
Felicity.

978
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,416
Since you're a songstress...

979
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,585
Give us a quick song.

980
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:04,920
To send the Masters on their way.

981
01:06:06,172 --> 01:06:07,298
Yes, sire.

982
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:26,066
Fatso, am I afraid of you?

983
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,799
"Yesterday, today."

984
01:06:50,883 --> 01:06:54,678
"The past has slipped away."

985
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:59,016
"Without make-up..."

986
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:03,896
"...colors fade."

987
01:07:04,355 --> 01:07:08,192
"All through history..."

988
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:12,655
"...love endures."

989
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:16,116
"Your love awaits your return."

990
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,120
"Wandering beyond the clouds."

991
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,875
"Love-sickness..."

992
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:27,795
"...begets sorrow."

993
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:32,967
"In this world..."

994
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:37,596
"...fate is immutable."

995
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:41,100
"Let it go."

996
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:46,522
"We cannot be together"

997
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:53,362
"ls this truly our destiny?"

998
01:07:58,534 --> 01:08:01,662
Splendid! Her artistry is magnificent.

999
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:14,549
Master...

1000
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:16,718
What is it?

1001
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,597
His Majesty asks
if you'd like to have Felicity...

1002
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,681
...for your travels?

1003
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:21,807
Out of the question!

1004
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,018
I go to the west
to find sutras and cultivate myself.

1005
01:08:24,393 --> 01:08:26,073
She couldn't make such an arduous journey.

1006
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,148
I have burned incense and prayed to Buddha

1007
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,608
I am a devout Buddhist.

1008
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:33,110
We must brave the elements with little to eat.

1009
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,654
A young woman couldn't endure it

1010
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,197
I'm not afraid.

1011
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,033
My family was poor

1012
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,577
I've done household chores since I was young

1013
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,787
I'm accustomed to hardship.

1014
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:44,580
Wonderful!

1015
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,290
What touching words.

1016
01:08:46,373 --> 01:08:47,958
This songstress...

1017
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:50,919
She can sing, dance, cook and wash.

1018
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,090
What a resource, at home and on travels.

1019
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:55,924
Still...

1020
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,427
Master, you really don't want her?

1021
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:00,386
I don't.

1022
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:03,182
You won't regret it?

1023
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,557
No regrets.

1024
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,020
Master, please take time to reflect

1025
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,396
I'll ask you once again.

1026
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,689
You don't want her?

1027
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:11,732
I don't.

1028
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:13,817
You must be kidding! Such a charming girl!

1029
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:16,737
Why don't you want her? You're weird!

1030
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,113
Minister...

1031
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:20,240
Please arrange this

1032
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:23,994
I want the girl sent to my chambers ASAP.

1033
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:27,539
Your Majesty...

1034
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:36,090
We'll take our leave now.

1035
01:09:41,762 --> 01:09:43,013
Attendants, see them out.

1036
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:44,199
Help them with the fish too.

1037
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:45,474
Come with me.

1038
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:29,643
When you've suffered pain...

1039
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,187
...you know the pain of all sentient beings.

1040
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:34,898
When you've insisted...

1041
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:36,734
...you know how to let go.

1042
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:40,059
When you've cared for others...

1043
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:42,823
...you know how to move on.

1044
01:10:44,992 --> 01:10:46,832
That's what spiritual attainment is all about.

1045
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,747
But me...

1046
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:52,666
I'm just an ordinary man.

1047
01:10:56,879 --> 01:10:57,963
Your Majesty...

1048
01:10:58,046 --> 01:11:00,215
The Master is back again.

1049
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:06,430
Master, you have broken your journey.

1050
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,348
What trouble did you encounter?

1051
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:10,184
I've been pondering

1052
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,286
I don't think I should reject...

1053
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,978
...Your Majesty's great generosity.

1054
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:16,064
Please allow Felicity to join me on my journey.

1055
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,151
You can do that, right?

1056
01:11:21,612 --> 01:11:22,529
I can, but...

1057
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:23,489
But what?

1058
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:26,575
I had my way with Felicity.

1059
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:31,747
Tell you what... Choose someone else.

1060
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:36,668
Master...

1061
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:39,087
I sympathize, but there's nothing I can do.

1062
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:44,134
You mean... But I don't mind.

1063
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:47,471
Your Majesty has favored Felicity.

1064
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:48,865
That makes me all the more honored.

1065
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:50,140
You don't mind?

1066
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:51,892
Definitely not.

1067
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:53,435
You don't mind...

1068
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:55,479
But I mind.

1069
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,692
The fact of the matter is...

1070
01:12:00,776 --> 01:12:02,778
Felicity resisted him last night.

1071
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,488
She refuses to be a concubine.

1072
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:07,324
She says she'd rather die than
be forced into it.

1073
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:09,660
Then...

1074
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:10,953
Yes!

1075
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,120
I lied to you.

1076
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:13,831
So what?

1077
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:16,834
Yesterday I asked you eight times...

1078
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,377
And you refused.

1079
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,255
Now you come back and change your mind.

1080
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,341
How reckless!

1081
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,468
Don't get worked up.

1082
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:28,220
Put down the drum.

1083
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:29,721
All the women in the harem...

1084
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:33,016
...look like they've been struck by lightning.

1085
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,519
But this one is good-looking.

1086
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:37,938
You won't grant me this one morsel?

1087
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:38,814
That's right.

1088
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:40,440
You bastard!

1089
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:43,902
Now that Master has made up his mind.

1090
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,786
And since Felicity refuses to be a concubine.

1091
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,031
Let's move towards a happy ending.

1092
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:49,658
Attendants.

1093
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,285
Fetch Felicity.

1094
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:53,328
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1095
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,163
Master.

1096
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,289
Drink some water.

1097
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:40,918
You first.

1098
01:13:41,001 --> 01:13:42,127
Thank you.

1099
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,049
Monkey, what are you doing?

1100
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,342
Taking a leak!

1101
01:13:48,592 --> 01:13:50,552
In front of a girl? What's got into you?

1102
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:52,304
Go over there!

1103
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:55,432
- Felicity...
- Master, come with me.

1104
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:57,476
I don't need to go.

1105
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:58,644
Yes, you do!

1106
01:13:58,727 --> 01:13:59,770
Come.

1107
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,106
One moment, I'll be right back.

1108
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:06,360
My dear...

1109
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,153
Who are you?

1110
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,113
I'm Second Brother.

1111
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:12,991
Isn't my true face... Completely irresistible?

1112
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:15,952
Sometimes...

1113
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:19,039
When I look in the mirror, my beauty stuns me.

1114
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:20,456
Second Brother...

1115
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:22,250
Brother Monkey is watching you.

1116
01:14:22,626 --> 01:14:24,086
So I can't look in the mirror.

1117
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:25,379
When I accidentally do...

1118
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:29,841
I would feel dizzy.

1119
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:41,520
Extreme!

1120
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:44,064
Mistress, go get a whip.

1121
01:14:44,356 --> 01:14:46,274
Lash me, correct me...

1122
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:49,319
Insult me, beat me, punish me...

1123
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,322
You're laughing at me.

1124
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,618
You're coughing, Third Brother.

1125
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,120
Drink some water.

1126
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,665
What's blocking your nose?

1127
01:15:17,264 --> 01:15:18,264
That's more comfortable!

1128
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:21,059
So you get back human form when you sneeze.

1129
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:23,854
You should've said, it's hard work pulling you.

1130
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:26,440
Master.

1131
01:15:26,523 --> 01:15:29,026
Try to pee just a little even
if you don't want to.

1132
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:30,709
Make a puddle to look at your reflection

1133
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,450
I'm handsome, does that bother you?

1134
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:39,369
You're not, you don't even have hair

1135
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:41,329
Felicity is quite good-looking.

1136
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:42,849
Why did she pass up being a queen...

1137
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,583
To follow you instead?

1138
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:46,835
What's on your mind?

1139
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:49,796
She's actually a demon, she plans to eat you.

1140
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:53,133
Don't do that!

1141
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,596
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1142
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:00,265
There are many kinds of demon.

1143
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:01,933
Some are easy to spot.

1144
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,936
Others aren't easy at all.

1145
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,399
So you have no proof.

1146
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:12,277
It's not hard to check.

1147
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,154
You've let her looks blind you.

1148
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,947
Get on her case.

1149
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:17,532
Do I have to tell you how?

1150
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:19,534
Aren't you a professional demon-hunter?

1151
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,185
What are you looking for?

1152
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,603
A mirror.

1153
01:16:47,104 --> 01:16:48,313
I have one.

1154
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:53,735
Thank you.

1155
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:56,988
What a shining bronze mirror!

1156
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:02,619
Doesn't it work?

1157
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:04,703
It's fine.

1158
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,086
Have you finished?

1159
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:13,213
I'll help comb your hair.

1160
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:24,558
What are you doing?

1161
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,060
A demon's blood will vaporize...

1162
01:17:27,144 --> 01:17:28,436
...on the mirror.

1163
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:31,398
That's impossible!

1164
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:32,524
Nothing happened.

1165
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,234
Shut it, demon-hunter.

1166
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,194
- Let's calm down.
- Where are you from?

1167
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:37,737
I'm from Rivermouth Village.

1168
01:17:38,488 --> 01:17:39,072
Rivermouth Village.

1169
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:40,508
It's on the other side of that hill

1170
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:42,075
I dare you to take me there

1171
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,679
I've never known a demon with a family

1172
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:44,953
<i>I'll go!</i>

1173
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:50,125
"Rivermouth Village"

1174
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:57,048
Felicity, it's so long since you visited us.

1175
01:17:57,132 --> 01:18:00,302
Ma, I'm following a monk west to find sutras.

1176
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:03,889
See how nice her family is?

1177
01:18:03,972 --> 01:18:05,640
You'd better apologize to them now.

1178
01:18:06,016 --> 01:18:07,976
Apologize? Dream on!

1179
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,485
Dad!

1180
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:25,118
Demon girl, you hired a big supporting cast.

1181
01:18:25,202 --> 01:18:26,036
No expense spared

1182
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,038
I don't know what the misunderstanding is.

1183
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:29,414
But please let my mother go.

1184
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:31,374
Spare the lives of my family.

1185
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:34,127
Don't be rash! Let her go.

1186
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:35,253
Ma.

1187
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:37,964
Brother Monkey, Master likes this young woman.

1188
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:39,128
But he still loves you too.

1189
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:41,009
Don't be jealous.

1190
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:42,677
Jealous?

1191
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,430
Will you shut up?

1192
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,852
Ma, Run.

1193
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:54,147
How many times must I tell you?

1194
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:55,440
This woman is really a demon.

1195
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:56,709
They're in league to do you harm.

1196
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:58,173
They're a family, three generations!

1197
01:18:58,443 --> 01:19:00,362
And you keep slandering them!

1198
01:19:01,029 --> 01:19:02,864
You're the one doing harm.

1199
01:19:02,948 --> 01:19:04,157
You're the demon.

1200
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:06,618
So you believe her rather than me?

1201
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:07,911
Yes.

1202
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:08,787
Fine.

1203
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:10,163
Then <i>I'll</i> kill her.

1204
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:18,964
How dare you smite me as a demon?

1205
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:20,757
All the women that I like.

1206
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,133
Such as Miss Duan before her.

1207
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:23,635
You want to kill them all?

1208
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:25,929
He finally said it.

1209
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:32,227
So you haven't forgotten.

1210
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,895
Of course I remember

1211
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:35,062
I'll always remember.

1212
01:19:35,105 --> 01:19:37,607
The way you beat her, beat her to death!

1213
01:19:38,483 --> 01:19:40,483
I thought you were
really treating me as a brother.

1214
01:19:40,652 --> 01:19:41,653
Brother?

1215
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,614
Since I'm stuck with
a mad killer like you, day in, day out...

1216
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:47,617
...I have to pretend to get along with you!

1217
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:49,828
If you died ten times, it wouldn't be enough

1218
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:52,163
I wish you'd go to hell and be damned forever

1219
01:19:52,247 --> 01:19:53,247
I see.

1220
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,208
If you're not my friend in this world...

1221
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,419
You're my enemy.

1222
01:19:58,586 --> 01:19:59,963
We've been enemies all along.

1223
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:01,715
Get out!

1224
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,718
Go away as far as possible,
while I'm in a good mood.

1225
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:07,387
So you're in a good mood?

1226
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:09,097
Listen, all of you.

1227
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,599
For all the demon I killed...

1228
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:12,683
...on this journey...

1229
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:14,269
I did it for him.

1230
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:16,813
My constant headaches...

1231
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,690
The lash-scars all over my body...

1232
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,775
That's all his doing.

1233
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:22,652
Whatever I owed him...

1234
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:24,404
I've repaid it in full.

1235
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:27,615
Whatever he owes me, no need to repay.

1236
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:30,285
From now on, our master-disciple bond...

1237
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:31,786
...is at an end!

1238
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,748
- Brother Monkey!
- Let him go.

1239
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:43,964
Dad

1240
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:10,033
Felicity, how's your family?

1241
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:13,244
They're recovering, they'll be fine.

1242
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,165
Please don't blame yourself.

1243
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,292
Who's Miss Duan?

1244
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:25,006
Miss Duan was also a demon-hunter.

1245
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:28,301
We faced life or death struggles together.

1246
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,928
I loved her a lot.

1247
01:21:30,553 --> 01:21:32,764
But I dared not admit it.

1248
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:34,432
Until the day I saw...

1249
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:35,892
...the way Monkey beat her.

1250
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,394
Beat her to death.

1251
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:39,312
And then it was too late.

1252
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:41,773
I let her down.

1253
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:45,276
And if you meet someone else you like...

1254
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,945
...will you let her down again?

1255
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,538
I never wanted too much from life.

1256
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,499
Just find the right man...

1257
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:03,670
Get married, have a baby...

1258
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:06,798
Settle down

1259
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:11,678
I've found that man...

1260
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,263
It's you.

1261
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:37,620
Master, it's a crisis!

1262
01:22:37,704 --> 01:22:38,621
Brother Monkey has gone mad.

1263
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:41,166
He killed everyone in sight,
we couldn't stop him!

1264
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,012
Pigsy, Sandy...

1265
01:22:54,095 --> 01:22:55,305
See if anyone can be saved.

1266
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,056
Ma! Dad!

1267
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,360
Dad! Ma!

1268
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:12,739
You can smile after killing so many?

1269
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:14,407
You're possessed by the devil.

1270
01:23:15,158 --> 01:23:17,327
Those I killed were all demons.

1271
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,496
So I won't waste words.

1272
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:20,899
You don't believe anything I say.

1273
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:23,374
<i>I'll</i> kill the last one.

1274
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:24,667
And have done with it.

1275
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:28,630
Don't force me.

1276
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:30,965
You'll give your life to protect a demon?

1277
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:32,634
I won't let you hurt any more...

1278
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:34,093
...of the people I love.

1279
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,596
You're possessed! Out of my way!

1280
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,390
That's enough!

1281
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:42,519
Enough?

1282
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:44,562
You want to die, so be my guest.

1283
01:23:44,854 --> 01:23:47,357
"Child, Child, why..."

1284
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,817
"Child, Child..."

1285
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:51,986
"Why are you so bad?"

1286
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:54,072
I'll sing it for you.

1287
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:58,242
Buddha's Palm?

1288
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,415
Buddha's Palm? Still pretending!

1289
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:05,750
You can't do it!

1290
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:12,257
Don't believe me, asshole?

1291
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:16,803
No!

1292
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:18,972
Please don't strike your Master.

1293
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,224
Stop, I beg you.

1294
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,436
That's very touching

1295
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,896
I'll kill you first.

1296
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,741
Baldy, you're worth nothing.

1297
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:42,537
Don't hit him!

1298
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,831
I'll admit it, I'm a demon

1299
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:46,666
I'm a demon.

1300
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:49,168
My real form is a skeleton

1301
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:51,546
I conjured up the illusion of this village.

1302
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:53,756
You need to hear her say it again?

1303
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,552
My beloved and I
were waylaid by mountain brigands.

1304
01:24:57,802 --> 01:25:00,930
My love abandoned me and fled

1305
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,015
I was horribly abused.

1306
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,729
The brigands raped me and left me to die.

1307
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:11,524
I turned into a heap of bones.

1308
01:25:11,608 --> 01:25:14,068
But my grievances have never died.

1309
01:25:19,741 --> 01:25:22,201
In truth, I'm nothing but bones

1310
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:25,246
I'm sorry.

1311
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,747
Heavens! Master is dead!
We can forget those sutras!

1312
01:26:11,793 --> 01:26:13,127
Hurray!

1313
01:26:42,281 --> 01:26:43,866
Case closed!

1314
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,077
Minister, you're so great!

1315
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:49,997
You had provoked Monkey's demonic nature.

1316
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:51,791
He's even gobbled up his Master.

1317
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,045
See how Buddha rages in the western sky.

1318
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:57,338
Shut up!

1319
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:02,260
I have a dream.

1320
01:27:02,677 --> 01:27:03,594
I want all the world's liars

1321
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:05,763
and monsters to show...

1322
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:07,515
...their true colors

1323
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,518
Felicity, no need to hide.

1324
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,520
Come on, show yourself.

1325
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:14,647
Your stratagem of sowing discord was smart.

1326
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,859
I know you have true feelings for the monk.

1327
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,944
You're following your heart.

1328
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:24,282
My very own path to supreme wisdom.

1329
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:28,995
So this is the legendary Monkey King?

1330
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,164
So cute!

1331
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:33,666
Like a banana?

1332
01:27:41,466 --> 01:27:44,427
Fine, we can adopt him as our pet.

1333
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:45,970
Why not!

1334
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:46,846
Six hands

1335
01:27:46,929 --> 01:27:50,141
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

1336
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:54,228
My turn!

1337
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:10,161
King of demons?

1338
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:12,288
All I did was cough.

1339
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,248
And you were terrified

1340
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:17,627
I'm your new Master.

1341
01:28:18,503 --> 01:28:20,087
You'd better obey me.

1342
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:21,923
Or you'll be spanked.

1343
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:51,577
So you're finally revealing your foxtail.

1344
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,161
My tail?

1345
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:54,997
No, I keep it well hidden.

1346
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,166
Monk...

1347
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,794
You're the one who stands exposed.

1348
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,963
All that canoodling with skeleton-demon here...

1349
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,006
Worldly desires are back?

1350
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:06,175
Felicity hasn't lost her virtues

1351
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,970
I'll make it possible for her to reincarnate.

1352
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:10,748
Your stratagem is to sow discord.

1353
01:29:10,847 --> 01:29:12,765
But we have a counter-stratagem.

1354
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:16,435
You thought we were fooled by Felicity.

1355
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:17,579
You thought she could sow discord...

1356
01:29:17,603 --> 01:29:19,605
...between Monkey and me.

1357
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:22,608
But you underestimated Monkey's vision.

1358
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:25,403
The skeleton-demon conjured up the village.

1359
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:26,654
We knew it at the beginning.

1360
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,491
And we pretended to be fooled by it,
<i>as</i> you hoped.

1361
01:29:30,575 --> 01:29:32,785
We tricked you into revealing yourself.

1362
01:29:32,869 --> 01:29:33,494
Minister...

1363
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:35,288
I'll tell you one more thing

1364
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,623
I'm actually very wise!

1365
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:45,548
Wise?

1366
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,050
Comfort yourself with your illusions.

1367
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:52,346
Let's see what you can do to me.

1368
01:29:54,599 --> 01:29:55,725
Strike!

1369
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:57,810
All right!

1370
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:46,275
Master, grasp my tail

1371
01:30:50,488 --> 01:30:51,572
Felicity!

1372
01:30:51,656 --> 01:30:53,532
Take care! Stay clear!

1373
01:30:56,285 --> 01:30:58,621
I'm the Monkey King!

1374
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:00,998
Demon, you cannot flee!

1375
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:10,257
Bad monkey, he's such a stupid monk.

1376
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:12,051
Is it worth dying for him?

1377
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,345
Master, she knows you too well.

1378
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:15,805
She says you're stupid.

1379
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:18,349
Don't listen to her, I'm very wise.

1380
01:31:19,183 --> 01:31:20,351
See my moves.

1381
01:31:20,893 --> 01:31:21,978
Ward me off?

1382
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:23,604
You think you can?

1383
01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:30,903
Monkey...

1384
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:32,655
Your nemesis is here!

1385
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:53,050
Buddha!

1386
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:56,303
Even Buddha is invited! Giving you real face!

1387
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:09,734
It's not possible.

1388
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,152
It's an imposter.

1389
01:32:11,235 --> 01:32:14,030
Yep, looks like he's had a nose and chin job.

1390
01:32:14,113 --> 01:32:15,614
Monkey...

1391
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:18,492
You've felt Buddha's power.

1392
01:32:18,617 --> 01:32:20,286
Come closer for the full effect!

1393
01:32:22,830 --> 01:32:25,458
Fine, try my Anchoring Pole.

1394
01:32:35,426 --> 01:32:38,471
No wave-swell can match the East Sea itself!

1395
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:06,624
Master, shelter in my ear-lobe.

1396
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:52,545
Two Buddhas!

1397
01:34:27,163 --> 01:34:28,789
Monkey, Monkey...

1398
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:55,000
Immortal gold vulture.

1399
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:57,503
You have cultivated yourself beside me.

1400
01:35:58,545 --> 01:36:00,756
Yet you do not understand.

1401
01:36:01,507 --> 01:36:05,261
No wonder you spread sophistry in the world.

1402
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,013
Lord Buddha

1403
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:09,848
I live for you

1404
01:36:09,932 --> 01:36:12,893
I've been by your side for so many years.

1405
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:15,521
But did you ever notice me?

1406
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:17,022
Say no more.

1407
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:21,318
Immortal gold vulture, show your true self.

1408
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,484
Try to stand, Felicity.

1409
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:04,621
I will try to exorcise your demonic traits.

1410
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:07,906
There's too much demon in me.

1411
01:37:08,157 --> 01:37:09,742
Even if you save me...

1412
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:12,202
I can't be sure I won't harm humans again.

1413
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:14,038
You conquer demons.

1414
01:37:14,538 --> 01:37:15,914
And I am a demon.

1415
01:37:16,332 --> 01:37:17,916
Free my soul.

1416
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,046
She's right.

1417
01:37:22,504 --> 01:37:25,632
Her acrimony runs too deep, she has to burn

1418
01:37:28,177 --> 01:37:29,470
Felicity...

1419
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:33,974
The greatest obstacle in the world is love.

1420
01:37:36,769 --> 01:37:40,314
She... is always here in your heart.

1421
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:42,232
She fills it.

1422
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:43,901
If only...

1423
01:37:44,818 --> 01:37:48,822
I could... Remain as a trace in your memories...

1424
01:37:48,906 --> 01:37:50,240
I'll be content.

1425
01:37:55,412 --> 01:37:56,747
Don't look at me.

1426
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,665
Clean up your own mess

1427
01:37:58,749 --> 01:38:01,126
I don't want you saying I've killed your girl.

1428
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:03,087
Let's go.

1429
01:38:07,716 --> 01:38:09,093
The truth is...

1430
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:11,553
I really have fallen for you.

1431
01:38:13,013 --> 01:38:15,224
Do you like me at least a tiny bit?

1432
01:38:18,435 --> 01:38:19,603
Sorry...

1433
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,397
My heart...

1434
01:38:22,022 --> 01:38:23,899
...has no space for anyone else

1435
01:38:25,567 --> 01:38:27,361
I'm so silly, aren't I?

1436
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:29,905
I knew that.

1437
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:31,407
But I still asked

1438
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:37,204
Felicity...

1439
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:41,125
I'm going to send you on your way.

1440
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,475
Master, we should talk...

1441
01:39:39,558 --> 01:39:42,144
Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

1442
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,814
I'm asking you...

1443
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:48,650
Did you ever have feelings for Felicity?

1444
01:39:50,486 --> 01:39:51,612
Of course not!

1445
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:53,280
You're the only one in my heart.

1446
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:54,781
Only me?

1447
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:55,866
Brother Monkey...

1448
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:58,327
Your headband was once Miss Duan's.

1449
01:39:58,410 --> 01:39:59,596
The memory of her still haunts Master.

1450
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,246
So he sometimes takes you for her.

1451
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:03,499
You can see it in his smile, look!

1452
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:05,417
Impossible!

1453
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:09,671
Really?

1454
01:40:11,006 --> 01:40:13,175
You don't trust even me?

1455
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:20,390
So did she ever touch your heart?

1456
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:24,061
Of course not, it's a meaningless question.

1457
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:25,687
Did you really think I'd say yes?

1458
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:27,290
You women always ask the same question.

1459
01:40:27,314 --> 01:40:29,483
So you did, you lowlife!

1460
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:30,817
Lowlife!

1461
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,095
This can't go on,
I'd better get back the headband.

1462
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,579
Or she'll ask again.

1463
01:40:43,956 --> 01:40:45,207
What are you doing?

1464
01:40:45,582 --> 01:40:46,667
Give back the headband.

1465
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,627
Are you crazy? You gave it to me.

1466
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:51,004
It doesn't suit you, it makes you look awful.

1467
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,982
You should have said so before, you can have it.

1468
01:40:53,006 --> 01:40:54,550
Hand it over! Why are you running off?

1469
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:56,611
I said I will give back to you
and you don't trust me?

1470
01:40:56,635 --> 01:40:58,303
Stop talking, give back to me

1471
01:40:58,387 --> 01:40:59,263
I've given it to you.

1472
01:40:59,346 --> 01:41:01,265
No, you just said you would.

1473
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:02,766
Right, I said I would.

1474
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:05,269
You said you would, but you haven't done so.

1475
01:41:05,352 --> 01:41:06,853
Haven't I? Are you sure?

1476
01:41:06,937 --> 01:41:08,564
I'm sure! Believe me for once!

1477
01:41:08,647 --> 01:41:09,647
I don't.

1478
01:47:57,889 --> 01:47:58,723
Let's go.

1479
01:47:58,807 --> 01:48:00,727
Hang on, there's probably more
after the credits.

1480
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:02,769
No need to wait, there's no post-credits scene.

1481
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:04,497
Please be sure to take all your belongings.

1482
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:06,606
Exit on the right side, thank you.

1483
01:48:07,107 --> 01:48:09,484
Hey, blockbusters always have
a post-credits scene!

1484
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:11,194
This isn't a blockbuster.

1485
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:12,779
So there isn't one.

1486
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:15,532
I repeat.

1487
01:48:15,615 --> 01:48:16,992
It's not a blockbuster.

1488
01:48:17,283 --> 01:48:18,702
So there isn't one.

1489
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:21,121
If this were a blockbuster.

1490
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:23,123
There'd be one
