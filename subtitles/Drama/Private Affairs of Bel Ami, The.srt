<i>Episode 6</i>

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,300
Bo Tong!

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,000
Choi David!

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Sold out! They sold out!

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
<i>This is all thanks to you, Bo Tong.</i>

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
It's all thanks to you.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,100
Bo Tong, it's all thanks to you!

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,600
It's all thanks to you, Choi David! <br>How could we have sold out?

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,500
<i>What to do?</i>

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
<i>I see it. Button.</i>

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,400
<i>Choi David, your button is...</i>

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>Kim Bo Tong?</i>

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,600
<br>

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,500
I can't.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Oppa! We sold out!

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,900
You worked hard.

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,800
You worked hard.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,200
It was nothing.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Our Bo Tong suffered a lot.

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,000
I have something to say to Bo Tong,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,900
so I'll take her for a moment.

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,300
Ah, yes.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,300
Say it here, Oppa.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
I said let's go.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,000
<i>♫ I need somebody now. ♫</i>

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,300
<i>♫ Do you know where to go? ♫</i>

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,700
<i>♫ I need somebody now. ♫</i>

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,900
<i>♫ Do you know where to go? ♫</i>.

31
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,700
<i>♫ I probably misheard the route, ♫ </i>

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>♫ The next thing I knew... ♫</i>

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>♫ I am wandering around for another day. ♫</i>

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
<i>♫ Seeing the world for the first time, like a child.♫</i><br>Ah, I really...

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,700
<br> <i>♫ Everything will be all new.♫</i>

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,200
I can really take ten pictures?<br><i> ♫I want to feel and ♫ </i>

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,700
I'm rewarding you for selling everything. Take only ten.<br><i>♫ experience everything. ♫</i>

38
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,800
Let me see.

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,900
I still have to take more.

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,000
Give it to me.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,800
Delete this and this.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,500
Why? They came out good!

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,400
How many times have I told you<br> that this is my good side?

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,300
Take it again.

45
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
Again.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,800
From what I saw earlier,

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,500
you're really close with Choi David.

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,800
You're going to look inadequate in front of the other employees.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
Then you must look inadequate, too.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,300
Because you always associate with women intimately.

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,700
Don't you want to take it?

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,100
Oppa!

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,400
Let's try one with you licking your lips.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,900
You keep defying me these days.

55
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,400
Oh.

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
It looks cheap.

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
Hey, forget it. I'm not doing it.

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,500
Oh my! I like that!

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,600
Your annoyed face.

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,100
That's enough, right? <br>Let's go to eat.

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,900
I have to go somewhere now.

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
With who? With who?!

63
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
Huh?

64
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Nothing.

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Oppa, can't I take one with you?

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>-Just one.<br>-Hey.</i>

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,500
Ah whatever!

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,400
Just one more!

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,700
shouldn't there be my comment <br>to congratulate our sold-out result?

70
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,200
All this honor

71
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,500
goes to Electric Fairy, or something like that.

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,900
This is all thanks to you pressing

73
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,800
Kim In Joong's button.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It's not that.

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Each of you already have the answers.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
What?

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,900
Strangely, people

78
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,200
come to ask me for answers they know the very well.

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Even President Jaek

80
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,800
thinks she made money by buying the real estate that I selected. But that's not it.

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,800
If I saw that she already wanted to buy something,

82
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
I just agreed with. that's all.

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,900
Ma Te, you're the same.

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,100
Could there be a person who <br>can control people's minds

85
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
better than you?

86
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,000
What?

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Ma Te, now stop coming to me.

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
Ma Te,

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,900
do you see my heart's button?

90
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,800
The button to my heart, you see it.

91
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Yes. I see it.

92
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,000
What kind of a button do you see?

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,200
You love me.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Indeed...

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,400
it was that.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,100
In my eyes, I don't see my button.

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,000
You can't see your own button?

98
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,300
A person can't control their own heart.

99
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Here, it's a present.

100
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,500
What is it?

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Later,

102
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,900
when the path you're traveling seems too difficult,

103
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,300
because you can't control your heart, you'll struggle.

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,000
At that time, definitely...

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
open this and look.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
It will become the answer

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
to control your heart.

108
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,900
Thank you, Electric Fairy.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Mom.

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,600
When the guy across the street bought his mother red undergarments with his first paycheck

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
you were really envious.

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,500
It was so obvious that you were.

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,900
Here, mom's son too...

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,500
I bought you red undergarments.

115
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,100
After making money for the first time,

116
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
I bought you a present.

117
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,300
Can't you come out for a moment

118
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
and accept this?

119
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,600
<i>Kim Mi Sook</i>

120
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,100
I really miss you.

121
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,800
Where you had to go, it was here?

122
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Well, the thing is...

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
I didn't know you would come here.

124
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,900
I bought some red undergarments to give Ahjumma.

125
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,800
I already bought some, so you can just wear those.

126
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,000
You've matured.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
How dare you to Oppa...

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Now that we've sold all the socks,

129
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I won't be able to see you again, right?

130
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,100
-As I look at these pictures, I'll...<br>-Hey, Kim Bo Tong.

131
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,600
Let's go as far as we can.

132
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,300
Huh?

133
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,200
Go as far as we can?

134
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
Well,

135
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,100
my body and heart are both ready, but this...

136
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's really make a lot of money.

137
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,300
Money?

138
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,000
There's nothing we can't do.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,900
You and I can make a huge amount.

140
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,600
As much as we can even buy out MG Group.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,300
Of course.

142
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,100
If Oppa sells as much as your looks, <br>then you'll make a huge amount of money.

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
If we were to convert your face into money,

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,000
we could go up against the best companies <br>of Korea without a problem.

145
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,900
Let's work hard.

146
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,400
Then firstly, we need a company name.

147
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,700
That Kim In Joong is really impressive.

148
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,800
Opens up the time slot we could never get,<br>in one sweep.

149
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,900
I want to know more about her.

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,000
She's the best within the insurance industry...

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,500
and her family situation is that her husband is working abroad.

152
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
There are no children. Is that enough?

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,300
Why?

154
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,900
The scenairo is too easy.

155
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,200
It won't be.

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,300
Her pet peeve word: gossip.

157
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,200
Her defense [in keeping you at bay] can get stronger.

158
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
Hello?

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes.

160
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Congratulatory party?

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
Of course we can. We worked hard.

162
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,500
What do you want to eat?

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,900
<i>Beef. Can we?</i>

164
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Ah, grill it properly!

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
- Ok.<br>- Whoa...

166
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
It looks so tasty.

167
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,100
Gosh, that scared me.

168
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,000
Man, President Dokgo.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,600
Why is it pork bellies on this good day?

170
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
Whatever.

171
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,800
It looks so delicious!

172
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,500
-You're too full, huh?<br>-Ohhh!

173
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
It's not thoroughly cooked yet!

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,700
I'll cook it for you.

175
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,000
It's not cooked yet?

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,700
Ah, I couldn't really see.

177
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
It's ok, I can see for you.

178
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,900
Someone hasn't grilled before not to <br> have any skill at it.

179
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,900
Hey, try to grill those. Those.

180
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,700
-This? This, this?<br>-Yeah.

181
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,400
Okee dokee.

182
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,500
Ah, I'll grill it.

183
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,300
-No, I'll grill it. <br>-I'll grill it.

184
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Assistant Manager Choi.

185
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,600
Our cleaning socks, what should be the next step?

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Why are you asking me?

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,900
Well,

188
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,500
because you are the expert.

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,400
If it were me, I would reinvest.

190
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,500
These items get copied quickly, so you need to rush.

191
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,900
While it's selling well, you need to sell as much as you can.

192
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,000
Because even these become a fad.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,100
We sold all the socks in the warehouse.

194
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
We have to make them again.

195
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,300
What?

196
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,600
We suffered so much trying to get rid of that mountain <br>of socks, and we're going to make them again?

197
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Oppa, when I see those white socks, I get nauseous now.

198
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
How do we make the socks?

199
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
What about the factory? The employees?

200
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,400
Ah, that's nonsense.

201
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Right, it will be too much to build a manufacturing factory.

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,100
We'll go with the OEM method.

203
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,000
We'll join with a sock factory that is already in operation,

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
and we'll manufacture and sell together.

205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Then what we have to do from now on, is to secure a sock factory.

206
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,100
Get strength from eating meat,

207
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,900
and we'll go secure a sock factory.

208
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
Kim Bo Tong...

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,300
-Ah, it's hot.<br>-Bo Tong!

210
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Are you ok?

211
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,700
-It's hot<br>-Are you ok, Bo Tong?

212
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
Bo Tong! Bo Tong, let's have a look!

213
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,100
-Are you ok? <br>-I'm fine, I'm fine.

214
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh!

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,500
Medicine! We need to put on medicine!

216
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey! It will scar! Medicine won't be enough, let's go to the hospital.

217
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
No, no. It's not that serious.

218
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
Assistant Manager Choi just went in to get the medicine, so...

219
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,500
Is this something to be fine about with just medicine?

220
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,400
No, I'm really ok.

221
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,100
Omo! Omo!

222
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,900
It will scar! You need to go to the hospital.

223
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,700
Bo Tong! Medicine, medicine, medicine...

224
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,400
Bo Tong...where did she go?

225
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, she was lifted up in a flash...

226
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,100
and just disappeared in the blink of an eye.

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,400
The situation is...well, like that.

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,100
That's why...

229
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,700
In the room,

230
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I could have just put on a band-aid.

231
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,600
Hey, it...

232
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,900
It was your left hand!

233
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,600
What does the left hand do?

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,300
It assists the right hand.

235
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
Normally for girls, Kim Bo Tong,

236
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,200
they wear their wedding ring on their left hand.

237
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,500
It's that kind of hand, the left hand!

238
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,800
So if there's a scar on that left hand,

239
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,700
will it be heartbreaking or not?

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Beautiful Team @ Viki</i>

241
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,100
<i>Is this something to be imagining?</i>

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
What are you doing?

243
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,900
It's nothing.

244
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,300
Come to the car. Oh, and you!

245
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes?

246
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Set up a meal appointment with Kim In Joong.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Yes.

248
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Oppa, you must be embarrassed.

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,500
Because you feel like your feelings have been exposed.

250
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,300
Ah, did I just receive a marriage proposal?

251
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,500
Bo Tong!

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,300
Assistant Manager Choi!

253
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,300
It's a sample. Please take good care of us.

254
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,700
But this...

255
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,100
Nowhere in this country will you be able to make it... with that production cost.

256
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,600
It was only possible 5 years ago...

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,800
It's really impossible nowadays.

258
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,800
At this price, we can't even pay for the yarn.

259
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,300
There will be no profit.

260
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,100
What I'm saying is, the [margin] is really low.

261
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Even if it's for volume sales <br>at a low unit margin of profit,

262
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,800
we can't give our production lines fully <br>to you for such a low margin.

263
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,300
We can find a factory. Don't worry about it.

264
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,200
What we achieved so far, in other people's eyes, they were all impossible.

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,900
But we did it.

266
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,200
You're right.

267
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,200
I've been thinking. We need to find a factory that has some affection for socks.

268
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
Honestly, if we just look at production cost,

269
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
it doesn't have much charm.

270
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Affection?

271
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,400
Shall we try attending a socks club meeting?

272
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,600
A socks club meeting?

273
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Those people have tremendous affection for socks!

274
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,100
Let's go and see.

275
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,300
That will be fun.

276
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,400
Yes, Oppa!

277
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
No.

278
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,300
Ok. Ok, I'll do it now.

279
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,400
Ok.

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,300
What is it?

281
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,400
Oppa gave me homework, but I forgot.

282
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>Kim In Joong</i>

283
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Hold on.

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes, Chief?

285
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm the distant cousin from last time.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,100
What to do? I said it's ok.

287
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,700
That was my goodwill.

288
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,800
I didn't help you to receive a greeting.

289
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,400
So don't be burdened.

290
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,800
Chief...

291
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,300
I really can't.

292
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,000
If I can't get an appointment with you, I'll get just fired.

293
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Can you just save me this once?

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,500
This is a sticky situation.

295
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Meet our President,

296
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,800
and just accept his greeting.

297
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,500
Because he's such a cool person,

298
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,100
he won't ever pester you or anything like that.

299
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,600
You can't get fired now, can you?

300
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,400
I have time the evening after tomorrow.

301
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,000
That's a relief, here.

302
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,400
Cleaning socks.

303
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,300
With what route

304
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
did they get to be listed as a subcontractor <br>and sell their product?

305
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,400
You see, the Household Department MD

306
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,300
came in with the 'cleaning socks' item, and because it was very original,

307
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,900
he gave them a trial thirty minute segment.

308
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
From now on, anything related to this business, report to me separately.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,100
Yes, I understand.

<i>Na Hong Ran does not have a stable position, being unmarried.</i>

<i>It's not a bad picture.</i>

329
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
<i>But one thing, spokesperson Park Gi Seok has a son.</i>

330
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,000
<i>I guess given Ms. Na Hong Ran's situation, <br>she has no choice but to take him in?</i>

331
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
<i>It could be love, as well. Love even makes you cross the ocean.</i>

332
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,500
<i>[In 1985] <br>MG Group's eldest son, Na Jin Seok</i>

333
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
<i>has died from a car accident.</i>

334
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,300
<i>According to the autopsy, high levels of drugs were detected.</i>

335
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,800
<i>We will now connect to the reporter at the scene of the funeral.</i>

336
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,100
From the outside, it was a natural succession procedure.

337
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,500
But from the inside, there must have been a bloody battle.

338
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,600
How did she win over all her siblings,

339
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,900
and sit in that spot?

340
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,000
Vice President Na Hong Ran.

341
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,400
The animals that will play with you, Bo Tong, are cute, right?

342
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,900
I could just live (without new wallpaper).

343
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,400
You're just suffering to do extra work.

344
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,100
What are you saying?

345
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,900
You're going to start your work properly now, <br>so you can't stay in a "desolate man's" room.

346
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,000
I will decorate it nice.

347
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,400
Thank you.

348
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
I will finish gluing this, Assistant Manager.

349
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,700
- David. <br> - What?

350
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,700
My name is David.

351
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,800
I would like you to call me David, not Assistant Manager.

352
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
David ssi?

353
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,800
David nim?

354
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,500
It's weird.

355
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,300
David... Oppa David?

356
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,900
It's weird.

357
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,600
I like to call you Assistant Manager.

358
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Well, then Assistant Manager Oppa? How's that?

359
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Assistant Manager Oppa.

360
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,000
Oppa, when did you come?

361
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,300
You were so excited, you couldn't even hear me.

362
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,300
Wow, is this a zoo?

363
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,500
I guess I have to pay an admission fee.

364
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,100
You don't have purity.

365
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,900
Why did you come? Do you have to ask me to do something?

366
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,300
Did you make an appointment?

367
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I sent you a message.

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,800
Did you come to ask that?

369
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,100
You didn't send me a message.

370
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,500
I sent you...

371
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
I didn't send you.

372
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,900
Ah, your style is very tacky.

374
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,800
Aigo, aigo, aigo.

375
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,000
It's pretty.

376
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,100
Right?

377
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,500
That person...

378
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,400
Oh right, today there is a meeting about the socks. <br>Do you want to go?

379
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,100
Call! (okay)<br>- Call.

380
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,200
Hello.

381
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,100
I'm Kim In Joong. Nice to meet you.

382
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,500
I don't have a business card at the moment. I'm out of them.

383
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,800
I will give it to you next time.

384
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,100
Sure.

385
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't know how to thank you.

386
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,700
I was thinking about it a lot.

387
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,800
Thank you for helping me.

388
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
No need.

389
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,900
You must be close with the Electric Fairy.

390
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,500
She called me and told me her dream.

391
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
If Electric Fairy did that,

392
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
I guess you are an important person to her.

393
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,800
If you're important to her, you're important to me.

394
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,600
I will definitely help you.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Oh, Chef!

396
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,000
I haven't had a chance to greet you, even though<br> you come here all the time.

397
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
Your food is your salutation.

398
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,400
But Chef, you seem to have a bad problem.

399
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,500
Your face doesn't look so good.

400
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,000
Maybe it's because I focused too much on my mother.

401
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Why? What about your mother?

402
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
She's a bit sick.

403
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,500
We did a health check, and they said she needs to do surgery quickly.

404
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,700
But, the doctor's schedule is full.

405
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,100
We have to wait half a year. Since she's old,

406
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,600
I don't know if she can endure it.

407
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,100
Who's the doctor?

408
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,400
Korea Hospital, Doctor Kim Kyung Jik.

409
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,800
Even though I look at different hospitals,

410
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,600
well, all the famous doctors seem to have <br>their schedules full for about 2-3 months.

411
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, that's why. What to do?

412
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,000
It's hard for me too.

413
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,600
Well, you have a customer, but I told my whole story here.

414
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,500
Should I make something for you?

415
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,100
I couldn't thank you for letting my restaurant <br>have your Ladies Club's monthly meeting.

416
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,300
It's okay. It's enough.

417
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,600
I don't think I saw Chief for the past 2 months.

418
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,500
Those elders in Ladies Club are so scary.

419
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,100
I can't digest.

420
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,000
Sorry.

421
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,400
It's okay.

422
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,100
I think I have to make a call.

423
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,300
Sure, do it. I'm okay.

424
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,500
Sorry.

425
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,500
Honey, you don't call me often.

426
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,600
I heard that you can't come to golf these days.

427
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
Are you busy?

428
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,400
Oh, that's why.

429
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,300
Well, I have to ask you something.

430
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,400
Did you say your brother-in-law is the President <br>of Korea Hospital Foundation?

431
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,900
Right?

432
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,200
I thought I heard it from somewhere before.

433
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Honey, can I ask you a favor?

434
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,900
Wow, this is fun.

435
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,600
Oh, how are you?

436
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
Omg, Unni.

437
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,700
Your fashion is amazing.

438
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,400
But, Bo Tong, your socks are amazing.

439
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,900
I need to wear these at the very least.

440
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,200
They're cute, huh?

441
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,600
They're so pretty, just like you.

442
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,200
What?

443
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,900
Pret...

444
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,100
Your socks are pretty, you put a lot of effort into them.

445
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,300
Wow, this is so amazing...

446
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:56,100
What is this? Did this really belong to Andersen?

447
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,400
No way...

448
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,000
Heol...

449
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,400
It must be real.

450
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Listen!

451
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,100
For the retro-evolution of four limbs walking,

452
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
let's toast together.

453
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,300
Cheers.

454
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,000
Cheers!

455
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,600
Now, you all know why we're gathered here. Ready.

456
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Four-limbs-walk-ing.

457
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:47,700
Four-limbs-walk-ing.

458
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,400
Bo Tong!

459
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,500
Four-limbs-walk-ing. Four-limbs-walk-ing.

460
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,800
Ugh, so cute!

461
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,000
Four-limbs-walk-ing.

462
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
Wasn't that so cute?

463
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,400
You got to start with the right foot first, four-limbs-walk-ing...

464
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,700
You should've joined in.

465
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,000
O-ho, an evolution athlete's foot sock.

466
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,700
Your fashion.. is amazing!

467
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Oh, well. I just decorated my mom's used sock a bit.

468
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,600
You must really love socks.

469
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,500
It's my karma.

470
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
How should I say it...?

471
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,700
It's the fate that I have to carry throughout my life.

472
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I run a small sock factory.

473
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,100
<i>Four.Limbs.Walking, Inc.<br>President: Kim Sa Jok.<br>(Sa Jok means four limbs).</i>

474
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Here.

475
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,300
To those toe socks;

476
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,100
Let's toast.<br>- Cheers.

477
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,700
You asked me to report on the Cleaning Socks.

478
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,400
They seem to have gained confidence <br> after making some profit

479
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
that their MD has asked me for the <br> prime time slot.

480
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,700
Of course I will cut...

481
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,600
The time slot,

482
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,500
allow it.

483
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,200
Yes.

484
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
Yes?

485
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Hello, this is Dokgo Ma Te.

486
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,300
Could you give me ten minutes of your time? <br> I have something to give you.

487
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,700
What to do?

488
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,300
My schedule is a little packed today.

489
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,900
I'll meet you wherever it works for you. <br> I just need ten minutes.

490
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,600
Then...

491
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,100
Around 3:00, do you want to meet me at Korea Hospital?

492
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,100
<i>Yes, then I'll see you there.</i>

493
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,100
It's taking a long time...

494
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
You're here because of that chef's mother's surgery, aren't you?

495
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,500
Yes, the surgery went well.

496
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,000
I thought I should say thank you.

497
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,400
But what was it that you had to give me?

498
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
I bought you a business card wallet.

499
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,600
I noticed before that yours was a bit worn out.

500
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,600
It wasn't expensive so don't feel too burdened.

501
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,400
My gosh... You're quite observant.

502
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,600
Mine was worn out because I've used it for so long.

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,500
But I'm not sure if I can accept this.

504
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,400
I took some concern picking out a <br>business card holder that was like you.

505
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
A beautiful person needs a beautiful business card holder.

506
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,200
Work hard.

507
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,600
Doctor!

508
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,300
I completely forgot that you were waiting!

509
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
The conference went on for so long...

510
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
But I'm sorry, I need to rush off.

511
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,300
That's quite alright.

512
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,800
I thought of you and brought a fountain pen.

513
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,200
I feel so apologetic though.

514
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
You already came several times to schedule the surgery.

515
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,900
I made you go through all those attempts first.

516
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,100
Not at all.

517
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,100
I'm more thankful to you for fitting the surgery into your busy schedule.

518
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,400
This is a fountain pen made <br>by an artisan in Japan.

519
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
I received it as a gift, but I don't know how to use it.

520
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,300
And I understand that you're a fountain pen collector.

521
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,800
At any rate, I must acknowledge how kind you really are, Chief Kim.

522
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
Thank you very much.

523
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
I'll find a time to buy you lunch.

524
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Thank you, I will enjoy the meal.

525
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,800
Okay, I'm sorry, I have to rush now.

526
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,400
See you next time. Thanks for the fountain pen.

527
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,800
Goodbye!

528
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm sorry, I didn't get to express my gratitude.

529
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,400
Thank you for the gift.

530
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Not at all.

531
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,200
But why did you give him the fountain pen gift now?

532
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,900
What I'm saying is, <br>if you met him several times before (to ask his favor),

533
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,600
wouldn't it have been easier to give it to him then?

534
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,400
Given earlier, a bribe.

535
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,200
Given later, a gift.

536
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,700
There is a world of a difference.

537
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,300
Oh, I see.

538
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,200
The first rule of networking (connection): <br>a difference between a bribe and a gift.

539
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,000
That's not it.

540
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,100
First, it needs to be concern.

541
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,900
Deep concern about the other person.

542
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,500
Concern enough to find out about a fountain pen collection.

543
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Considering that, you also have potential.

544
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,100
My employees don't even know that my business card wallet is worn out.

545
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I'll buy you a coffee in return for the expensive lesson I just learned.

546
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,300
I have appointments backed up today though.

547
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,800
Then.

549
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,400
<i>Chief Kim's most hated word: gossip. <br> Her defense may get stronger.</i>

550
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,900
Afraid of gossip...

551
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,100
Gossip...

552
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,500
Hyung...

553
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,600
Think on it just once more.

554
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,300
How many times do I have to tell you to drop it?

555
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,900
Assistant Manager Choi must not have gone to work today.

556
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,600
Uh, I came for an outside work.

557
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,800
At your own house, I see.

558
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,200
This one.

559
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,100
Did you look into some sock factories?

560
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,800
It's a complete "catch the stars".

561
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,400
We are looking for it here and there together, but

562
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,600
no one's responding.

563
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
However,

564
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,900
who are we? We found one place, right?

565
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,300
It's a factory called Four Limbs Walking,

566
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,100
The possibility is a little higher with this one.

567
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,400
Assistant Manager Choi also feels this may be the only factory that would manufacture our socks.

568
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
How do we get through this one?

569
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,700
<i>The first rule</i>

570
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,800
<i>is an interest.</i>

571
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,300
<i>A deep interest towards another.</i>

572
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,500
Find that factory president's facebook page.

573
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Where do I look for that?

574
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Should we start by looking for a blog, since these days they usually link their facebook page to their blog?

575
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Then we can look at socks sites.

576
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Let's see.

577
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,100
Oh, there is one!

578
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,400
Ohhhh.

579
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Let's see here.

580
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Oh my world! ____

581
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,000
Wow, this guy really likes socks.

582
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,900
Oh, and there's blood sausage soup.

583
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Seeing the pictures makes me want some blood sausage soup.

584
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,800
Blood sausage soup?

585
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,100
I'm really sick of it these days as my mom boils it all the time.

586
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,500
You're sick of it you say? That delicious Blood Sausage soup?

587
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:26,200
I thought your mother's blood sausage soup was the best.

588
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
What are you saying?

589
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,900
When did you have her mother's soup?

590
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,400
Well, you see, I had it at her house.

591
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,300
Her house?

592
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:43,000
When you were providing the "new tenant pick up service", you ate it, right?

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,100
Putting in some real effort. Like some pick up service [shuttle] for English enrichment for elementary school kids.

594
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,300
So if I were to translate the word "pick up service",

595
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,700
it's the same word as the "consideration".

596
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,900
I've made a plan to go to Four Limbs Walking factory with Director Choi tomorrow.

597
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
- Do you become familial with anyone?<br>- What's that?

598
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,900
I'm talking about Director Ch...

599
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,400
Never mind.

600
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,000
Bring a bowl of Blood Sausage soup from your mom, tomorrow morning.

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,700
Why all of a sudden?

602
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Are you getting all cranky with me?

603
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,000
Of course not.

604
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,400
I was just curious about why.

605
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,800
I want to try it, to see how good it is.

606
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,600
He can have some, but I can't?

607
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,300
Mom, it's one in the morning, why do we need to do this?

608
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,400
Because Director Choi says he's craving it.

609
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,900
Aigoo, listen. For whatever reason, I like Director Choi <br>and he feels like a son-in-law.

610
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,100
Let's not count our chickens before they hatch, Mother.

611
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,800
We can just do this tomorrow!

612
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,000
She said he had to have it tomorrow!

613
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,300
I have to start boiling it now to get that rich broth.

614
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,800
After this, I can sleep, can't I?

615
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,000
Sleep, what sleep?

616
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Go to the slaughterhouse and buy a fresh beef intestine, kiddo.

617
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,900
KIM BO TONG!!!

618
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Up until today, we've been rejected <br>by thirty-eight sock factories.

619
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,800
We have to break through this one.

620
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,000
Ah, I have a feeling.

621
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,900
This was meant to be.

622
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Four Limbs Walking.

623
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,000
Barefooted dream, barefooted youth, barefooted friend,<br>barefooted towering peak...

624
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,800
These are the things

625
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
we detest the most.

626
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,300
Right?

627
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,300
So, I made some samples here.

628
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,200
Please take a look.

629
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,900
Oh, this is the first I'm seeing this style.

630
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,400
You've used the material in a truly unique way.

631
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,300
Due to the costly material, it won't be easy to determine the unit price, but

632
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:45,400
we believe that more than actualizing the profit, providing the socks to the people who need them as our mission.

633
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,600
This lovely sock

634
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,700
first needs a name.

635
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,500
It's white, and soft as cotton.

636
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,200
If that's so,

637
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,500
the sock that white angel's feather is comforting my soul.

638
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,200
What do you think?

639
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,400
You see, that's a cleaning sock.

640
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,900
- Aigoo!<br>- Ouch.

641
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
<br>

642
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,900
What will you do with the sacred socks?

643
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,600
Clean, clean?

644
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,100
You guys don't have the right to stand in this office!

645
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,700
Get lost!

646
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,800
Wait.. Mister!

647
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,200
Just give us five minutes to explain!

648
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,500
Bo Tong, are you okay, are you not hurt?

649
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm okay.

650
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
Are you okay?

651
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,800
I'm okay.

652
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
What a waste.

653
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,600
It's a shame that I'm the only one to see this.

654
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,700
Oh, my head, Headache Kim Bo Tong.

655
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,100
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Beautiful Team @Viki</i>

656
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,300
Hmm... I think that from our end, our introduction was faulty.

657
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,200
We would never insult socks by making them into cleaning products.

658
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,100
Are you playing with words right now?!

659
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,700
No sir.

660
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,400
You even went to Paris to study fashion abroad

661
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,200
and you chose socks of all apparels,

662
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,500
your love for socks are shown.

663
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,200
Did you even do a background check on me?

664
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,700
Not at all.

665
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,200
I've found you!

666
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,700
Someone who will partner with our vision.

667
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,600
Here, look at my employee.

668
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,700
To the extent that she'd make a sock into a handbag,

669
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,000
socks are precious items to us.

670
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,200
She didn't buy it, but made it herself?

671
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,400
Yes.

672
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Someone threw it away in the alley, so I picked it up and...

673
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,700
Revival.

674
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,600
Socks that are decreasing in popularity, we are <br>saying that we'll revive them.

675
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,800
Even in the winter, it is becoming fashionable not to wear socks.

676
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,600
Socks are continuously decreasing in popularity.

677
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,000
Cleaning socks are

678
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,200
are going to take dying socks and revive them!

679
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,800
Oh, my brother!

680
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,600
Oh, my socks!

681
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,900
Oh, my god!

682
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,200
Please, eat up.

683
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,800
You didn't have to...

684
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,600
<i>Mom's?</i>

685
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>What?!</i>

686
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,900
<i>Mom's?</i>

687
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,700
President Dokgo, today you are<br> touching my heart in various ways.

688
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,200
I can't believe this flavor.

689
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,000
I've tried most blood sausage soups.

690
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Where is this soup from?

691
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I thought you were going to eat it.

692
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,200
Am I the type that needs to eat something if another ate it?

693
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,700
If you came earlier and gave the <br>soondae soup, it would've been easier.

694
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,300
Given earlier, a bribe.

695
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Regardless of the result, given after, a gift.

696
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,400
Would you understand this?

697
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,800
If you give the soondae soup from the beginning,

698
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,400
then it's given to win our deal for the socks.

699
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,100
But if you give the soup after the socks have been discussed,

700
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,300
you give the other's most<br> precious treasure and give it as a gift,

701
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,900
that is that soondae soup.

702
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,300
This is

703
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
true skill of networking.

704
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,000
Understand?!

705
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,200
How is Oppa getting smarter?

706
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,600
I sent a picture to your house.

707
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
What is with that wallpaper?

708
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,600
At your age, horses and rabbits...<br> Are you trying to race with them?

709
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,500
If your wall seems empty, put it up.

710
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,800
I sent it for "Fighting." (strength)

711
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Why are you trying to critique someone's interests?

712
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,600
What kind of picture would he have sent?

713
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,900
Wow... no matter what, Oppa's this kind of guy...

714
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,600
This size is really.. overboard..

715
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,100
But it's still pretty...

716
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,600
It's prettier because it's bigger.

717
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,100
How can you look like this...?

718
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,900
Hello?

719
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,500
Yes.

720
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,600
Yes, I am he.

721
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,000
What can I help you with?

722
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,500
I'm contacting you from MG Home Shopping.

723
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,900
We wanted to make a meeting to discuss with you about your Cleaning Socks.

724
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,500
You want to discuss about Cleaning Socks?

725
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,600
When should we meet you?

726
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,500
Are you available at 2PM tomorrow?

727
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,000
Yes.

728
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,600
Thank you very much.

729
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,200
Oh my gosh!

730
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
You even know how to play the guitar?

731
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,500
I just play it a little as a hobby...

732
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,400
Wow, so cool...

733
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,100
It's cool?

734
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,000
Do I look cool?

735
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,400
What song is that?

736
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,600
Umm.. a song I made.

737
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,900
Wow...

738
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,400
You even write songs?

739
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,700
Let's hear it! Let's hear it!

740
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,700
Well, there's no lyrics yet.

741
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,600
When it's completed, let me listen to it.

742
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,900
I will properly be a fan.

743
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,400
I do a little act with some friends I know. <br>Do you want to come and see?

744
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,500
Daebak!

745
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,800
Call! (Okay!)

746
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,900
Man, I'm envious of everything you do.

747
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,800
You "glamping" under the stars...

748
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,000
you play the guitar well..

749
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,500
Ahh... I want Bo Tong to do everything you want to do,

750
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,900
but it's too cold for "glamping"

751
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,900
then, do you want to sleep with the window open?

752
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,600
No, then you'll catch a cold.

753
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,300
I'll just come outside when you're playing the guitar.

754
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,900
Then I can see the stars and see Nim.

755
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Nim?

756
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,400
I guess not Nim.

757
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,700
Should I teach you guitar?

758
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,700
Me?

759
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Sure...

760
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,800
Here.

761
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,300
Is it really okay to learn it?

762
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
How? How?

763
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,500
I'll teach you the most basic C chord.

764
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,900
Press here.

765
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,400
-Here? <br>-Yes, there.

766
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Then, your index finger here.

767
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,400
And your ring finger here!

768
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,800
Here... Here...

769
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,300
Try making a sound.

770
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,900
...You did.. very well.

771
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,600
Right??

772
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,300
I did it! Ah!

773
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,700
C!

774
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh, C!...

775
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Oh...

776
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Then next chord, F!

777
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,300
F!

778
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,100
This is kind of hard...

779
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,400
- Is that right?<br>- Here.

780
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,200
♫ <i>Perhaps I've gone down the long lane, </i>♫

781
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,600
♫ <i>when I came to my senses, </i>♫

782
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,800
♫ <i>I'm wondering around for a whole day. </i>♫

783
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,100
Why are you meeting here?

784
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,400
If it's regarding the company, shouldn't you meet in the office?

785
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,700
The person keeps saying that she has business to do in the area.

786
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,500
Does it matter about location?

787
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,500
We just need to discuss whether she <br>wants the product or not...

788
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,300
You two are more shocked that expected.

789
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,400
I thought meeting casually was the best, <br>so I asked to meet here.

790
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,200
Are you uncomfortable?

791
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,700
How could it be?

792
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,400
I like the environment.

793
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,100
How's the coffee here?

794
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,200
Go ahead and discuss.

795
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,000
I will get you some coffee.

796
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,800
Shall we sit?

797
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:19,500
For MG Home Shopping's "Hot Time", the quota is four billion.

798
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,800
Yes, I'm aware of that.

799
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,900
I'll give you the time slot that you want.

800
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,800
There's no way you'll give it to me that easily.

801
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,700
Of course not.

802
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,100
It's not how you do charity work.

803
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,700
There's one catch. Meet the four billion quota.

804
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,400
What if.. what if we don't?

805
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,300
Regarding Home Shopping sales, <br>there is a division of 60 to 40.

806
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,600
With the mindset of helping a growing kid,

807
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,300
the 60% to 40% ratio, you are the 60%, right?

808
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,100
I don't care for your 60%.

809
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:03,600
You need to compensate for the 40%.

810
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,500
And, with acknowledgement of defeat,

811
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,200
you are cleanly out.

812
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,300
Are you willing to accept this MG offer?

813
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,800
Sure.

814
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,800
After hearing the MG offer, I'll mention mine.

815
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,900
First,

816
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,200
no interference of any kind.

817
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,500
Since the name Na Hong Ran isn't palatable,

818
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,400
I will stake MG Group's name on it.

819
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,800
Second, please give the best host.

820
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,900
Given.

821
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,700
Then understanding that, we'll prepare.

822
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,500
I look forward to it.

823
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,500
Did you think this through?

824
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,200
Are you being too defenseless?

825
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,500
I don't mean that toward you spending your money.

826
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,800
We could have fallen into Na Hong Ran's trap.

827
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,500
The factory is running smoothly.

828
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,900
Assistant Manager Choi and Bo Tong struggled for this opportunity.

829
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,300
If we don't take this offer, then they won't give another

830
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,100
and we'll lose sock sales, but

831
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,700
the efforts of the struggling people...

832
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,900
how are we going to compensate that?

833
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:41,200
We just need to succeed like the first time.

834
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,400
I'll make you a cup of mocha.

835
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,600
Drink it and be strong.

836
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,500
Let's use this cafe as collateral.

837
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,500
If you lose this game, <br>then you'll face the consequences, too.

838
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,200
Do you know what's the most scary thing in a company?

839
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,800
It's clean up.

840
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,000
Prime time section,

841
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,100
Who will be cleaned up

842
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,000
Hurry. Hurry.

843
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,900
Yes.

844
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,700
Bo Tong Company's "Kkal Kkeumee (Clean-y) Socks"

845
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,900
<i>We need to come up with a company name.</i>

846
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,800
<i>Oh.. you're right.</i>

847
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,800
<i>Company name... what should we name it?</i>

848
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,000
<i>Bo Tong Company.</i>

849
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>What, our galbi restaurant name?</i>

850
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,200
<i>Bo Tong Company.</i>

851
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,800
<i>It's perfect.</i>

852
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,200
<i>My mom said that</i>

853
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,200
<i>Bo Tong is the biggest and hardest thing.</i>

854
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,300
<i>That's why my mom named me and the restaurant Bo Tong,</i>

855
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,000
<i>but I'm forever an expense</i>

856
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,300
<i>and the restaurant is doing bad.</i>

857
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,700
<i>We should name it something else, Oppa.</i>

858
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,200
<i>No, I don't want to think more about it.</i>

859
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,300
<i>"Bo Tong Company", nothing else.</i>

860
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,500
The name of the company is really nice.

861
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
<i>Bo Tong Company's Kkal Kkeumee Socks.<br>[Average Company's Cleany Socks]</i>

862
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,300
<i>-Hello!<br>-Hello, there!</i>

863
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,800
<i>We have prepared the first item of our broadcast.<i></i></i>

864
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,600
<i>Cleaning socks, the item that became so popular last time,</i>

865
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:18,100
<i>we have prepared it this time once again.</i>

866
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,100
During this time, you are wondering about the price, right?

867
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,000
For 39.99, it will greatly improve you life.

868
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,200
Isn't that a good price?

869
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:45,000
Oppa, it's not even selling half of what we sold last time.

870
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,800
You have to purchase this item during the broadcast.

871
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,500
The most important thing is that it is<br> MG Home Shopping's supported item.

872
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,100
You cannot see this product anywhere else.

873
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,400
Let's purchase this item today.

874
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,100
Let's show the clip of them cleaning.

875
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,500
Yes.

876
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,800
As we are cleaning, isn't this window <br>the worst type to clean?

877
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,500
Yes it is. This window, it's not like <br>we can bring up a vacuum cleaner.

878
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,600
It's not like dirt falls off the window automatically.

879
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
We don't even need to say much.

880
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,500
We'll show you through your eyes.

881
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,000
We'll clean it for you now.

882
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,700
Those difficult portions that are hard to reach,

883
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:35,200
you can reach them with these Cleaning Socks.

884
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,400
You are right.

885
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,100
This product is slowly being sold.

886
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,500
Unlike it's showing last time.

887
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,800
Oppa, at this pace, one billion will be difficult.

888
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,600
<i>In the 6:4 ratio, compensate for the 40%.</i>

889
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:01,300
<i>And, admitting defeat, you are cleanly out.</i>

890
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:06,300
<i>Are you willing to accept the MG Home Shopping offer?</i>

891
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,900
<i>Preview<i></i></i>

892
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,000
<i>Oppa, how can it..?</i>

893
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,700
<i>I will take care of everything...</i>

894
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,100
<i>Help me, please.</i>

895
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,600
<i>Should we drink this comfortably?</i>

896
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,600
<i>What about a different approach?</i>

897
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,900
<i>A different approach?</i>

898
00:58:58,900 --> 00:58:59,900
<i>What are we doing now, Oppa?</i>

899
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,100
<i>What about scouting Assistant Manager Choi?</i>

900
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:03,900
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

901
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,500
<i>Hello? <br>- Ahjussi.<br></i>

902
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,700
<i>If it's not urgent...</i>

903
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,700
<i>I'll tell you the third advice.</i>

904
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,600
<i>Director!</i>

905
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,000
<i>Are you dating?</i>

906
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,300
<i>Vice President, you knit very well.</i>

907
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,900
<i>If anyone looks at you, they'd think you had children.</i>

908
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,300
<i>What did you say?<br>- ________</i>

909
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:29,900
<i>There is a favor that you need to take on. <br>A favor you must do.</i>
