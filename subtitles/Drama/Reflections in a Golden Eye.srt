1
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,983
Private Williams!

2
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:16,515
Report to Major Penderton's house
for a work detail.

3
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,947
Weldon!

4
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:53,348
Yeah?

5
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,426
I'm going for a ride, Weldon.

6
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:58,319
Okay.

7
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,594
What do you mean,
"just a little scratch"?

8
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,201
Look at that! He's been kicked.

9
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,803
It's just a nick, ma'am. He ain't hurt.

10
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,372
Where's my boy? The boy
that takes care of Firebird?

11
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,406
- Private Williams?
- I guess so.

12
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,704
Why, ma'am,
he's up at your house.

13
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,579
What do you mean, my house?
What's he doing up there?

14
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,807
He's doing some work for the major.

15
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:57,888
I asked Weldon to have
the garden tilled out in the back.

16
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,115
I've invited so many people
to my party...

17
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,226
...they're just gonna spill
out of the house.

18
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:18,632
Come on, you sweet old thing.

19
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,212
All right, now, private. This...

20
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,374
This section of woods
is to be cleared here.

21
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:38,113
Take away all the undergrowth
and the briar and the bushes.

22
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,055
Any of the limbs of the large trees
growing at a level of less than six feet...

23
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:44,160
...are to be cut away.
You understand?

24
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,890
- Yes, sir.
- That's a level of less than six feet.

25
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,227
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.

26
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:53,632
Now, your boundary
will be this large oak tree here.

27
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,830
You won't have to clear beyond it...

28
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:59,238
...just from the edge of the grass here
to the oak tree there.

29
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,568
I'll expect you
to complete this work today.

30
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,146
All the tools we've got
will be found in the garage.

31
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,715
I'll be back sometime
late this afternoon.

32
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:20,096
Listen, I think that the thing
we all overlook, everybody forgets...

33
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:22,596
...is that who really knows...

34
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,997
...what happened to her in her mind?

35
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,399
Nobody knows that.

36
00:08:27,972 --> 00:08:30,634
- Also...
- "Also"? Also what?

37
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,639
Hell, Leonora,
it's been three months.

38
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,506
Now, she hasn't tried
to do anything like that since...

39
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,615
...and she seems to be okay.

40
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,808
Oh, what does that prove, Morris?

41
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,113
That Alison really is all right?

42
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,813
Well, yes, I guess so.
She hasn't tried to do it again.

43
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,219
How could she?

44
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:51,954
What she did is something a lady
can only do once, now, isn't it?

45
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,065
Give me your cap.
I want to pick some blackberries.

46
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:46,181
There.

47
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:50,416
Now let's take
two things Clausewitz says.

48
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:53,419
First, the theory of warfare
tries to discover...

49
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,082
...how we make any preponderance
of physical forces...

50
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
...and material advantages
at a decisive point.

51
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,061
And two, one of the strongest
weapons of offensive warfare...

52
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,202
...is the surprise attack.

53
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,006
Now, I would not like
to improve on Clausewitz...

54
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:12,006
...but I would say
that the night detect...

55
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:16,078
...is one of the strongest weapons
of offensive warfare.

56
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:21,109
We can look to Major General Terry Allen
when he commanded his forces in Africa.

57
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,618
He employed the night detect
to the maximum.

58
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,314
Economy of force...

59
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:39,730
Economy of force.

60
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,739
Concentration, surprise, security...

61
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,638
...offensive action,
movement, cooperation.

62
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:49,507
All of these have their application
in the night operation.

63
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,694
Susie!

64
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,525
Susie, I'm home!

65
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,365
Hi, there, soldier.

66
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,575
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,818
Wait a minute.

68
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:33,114
Pull!

69
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,733
I think I'll have my drink
out here.

70
00:11:44,902 --> 00:11:48,065
I might as well do those invitations
while I'm at it too.

71
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,076
Soldier...

72
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:58,415
...I heard you were here this morning,
down at the stables.

73
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,210
My Firebird has been kicked.

74
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:04,350
- How?
- That, I would like to know.

75
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:08,720
Probably by some damn mule, or maybe
they put him in with the mares.

76
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,828
I was pretty mad about it.
I asked for you.

77
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:21,527
Thanks, Susie.

78
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:23,970
Soldier, do you want a drink?

79
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:28,267
Want a drink, soldier?

80
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:32,411
- No, ma'am.
- Don't you ever drink?

81
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,143
- No, ma'am.
- Not ever?

82
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,285
No, ma'am.

83
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:10,116
Damn.

84
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,808
Evening, Leonora.

85
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:39,443
There they are. All 64 of them.

86
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:42,085
I hope I haven't left anybody out.

87
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,780
How do you spell "cordially"?

88
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:50,524
Cordially.
C-O-R-D-I-A-double L-Y.

89
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:52,525
Oh, no!

90
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:56,531
Don't tell me I have to do them
all over again.

91
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,697
Well, I expect you better.

92
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,962
Oh, God.

93
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:09,777
What's the matter with you?

94
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,798
Private, the whole idea
was in the big oak tree.

95
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:34,631
The instructions were to clear
the ground just to the oak tree.

96
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,365
The way the branches
swept down and made a background...

97
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,237
...shutting off the rest of the wood
was the whole point.

98
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,974
Now it's all ruined.

99
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,980
What would the major like me to do?

100
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:51,149
Well, the major would like you
to pick up the branches...

101
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:53,222
...and nail them back on again.

102
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,383
No, no. Just get some leaves here...

103
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,324
...and cover the bare spots
where the bushes been removed.

104
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:00,725
Then you can go.

105
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,857
Here.

106
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,075
That's the boy from the stables,
the one that takes care of Firebird.

107
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:17,045
Yes, well...

108
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,645
He's also the soldier that
ruined a brand new silk suit for me.

109
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:27,217
Spilled the better part of a coffeepot
all over my knees.

110
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,617
That was two years ago,
wasn't it?

111
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,623
It'll be a lot longer than that
before you'll forget.

112
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,828
I dislike clumsiness,
willful or otherwise.

113
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:44,202
Well, there's nothing clumsy
about the way he handles Firebird.

114
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,369
Morris says he's never seen
an enlisted man...

115
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:49,172
...to handle a horse to equal him.

116
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,315
Morris would find something to like
in any enlisted man.

117
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:56,885
All right, then, Firebird likes him.

118
00:15:58,722 --> 00:15:59,950
Firebird's a horse.

119
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,821
Firebird is a stallion.

120
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,385
So these two little queers
went into this bar...

121
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,821
...and this great big old barman
was looking at them for a long time.

122
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,587
Finally he said, "Are you two sisters?"

123
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,287
And they said, "Hell, no.
We're not even Catholic."

124
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:06,449
Oh, you're so funny.

125
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:22,138
For God's sakes, Leonora, why don't you
go upstairs and put your shoes on?

126
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,175
Oh, my.

127
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:33,316
Oh, my good...

128
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,032
You look like a slattern
going around the house this way.

129
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,397
Langdons come to dinner...

130
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:57,234
...I suppose you're gonna sit down
at the table like that.

131
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:00,944
Sure. Why not, prissy?

132
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:03,774
You disgust me.

133
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,822
I'll kill you. I swear, I'll kill you.

134
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:30,328
I'll do it! I will kill you!

135
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,968
Son, have you ever been collared...

136
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,337
...and dragged out into the street...

137
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:42,445
...and thrashed by a naked woman?

138
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,938
- Would anyone like a drink?
- I would, thanks.

139
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:13,337
Alison?

140
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,035
Very, very light, please.

141
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:19,914
Sugar?

142
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,112
Do you want another card?

143
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:33,061
- Big one?
- Oh, not too big, not too small.

144
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,028
Make mine straight on the rocks.
Not too big, not too small.

145
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,533
I'll have the same, Weldon,
and a little of that branch water.

146
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,740
Weldon, your wife's cheating.

147
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:47,343
- She tried to look at this card to see if...
- I did not.

148
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:51,447
You caught me before I had a chance to.
What have you got there?

149
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,410
I'm surprised at you, Morris.

150
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,846
Sitting down playing cards with a woman.
Expecting her not to cheat you.

151
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:03,426
What's this,
a new sweater for your husband?

152
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,527
It's for Captain Weincheck.

153
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,561
Captain Weincheck. I forgot to invite him.

154
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,894
Well, that's the story of his life, isn't it?

155
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:15,470
Everybody forgets about Weincheck,
including the promotion board.

156
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,399
He's about the oldest captain in the Army.

157
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:23,603
Will somebody please tell me
why Captain Weincheck is unpopular?

158
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:27,414
Is it because he plays the violin,
reads Proust?

159
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,779
Oh, do you remember that tea he gave?

160
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:35,892
Classical records and cat hairs.
And before God, tea. Only tea.

161
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:39,555
Captain Weincheck is a gentleman...

162
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:42,292
...and he's not a thief.

163
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:45,058
Who said he was?

164
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:48,136
That afternoon you were speaking of,
at his apartment?

165
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,433
Somebody stole a little
silver Georgian teaspoon.

166
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,335
One of a set of eight
belonging to his great-grandmother.

167
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:58,208
It was gone when we went to tidy up.

168
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:04,946
He asked me never to tell about it,
but somebody stole that spoon.

169
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,919
Well, I didn't. It wasn't me.

170
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:13,957
Well, I'm gonna put everything I have
on this one hand...

171
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:18,431
...and if I win,
I'll have every chip on the table.

172
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,531
Hit me.

173
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,375
Are aces ones?

174
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:32,471
Blackjack.

175
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,645
I must be getting along.

176
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:39,646
But you stay, Morris.

177
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:42,348
Don't break up the party.

178
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,550
Good night, everybody.

179
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:47,561
Alison, I'll see you to your doorstep.

180
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,496
Good night, Alison.

181
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,369
She is crazy.

182
00:22:58,408 --> 00:22:59,670
No, she's not.

183
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:04,104
You know, I had the best doctors for her.
They all say she's fine.

184
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:06,909
Well, now, look here.
You know we're scared for her...

185
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,917
...just to go from our front door
to yours alone.

186
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:12,646
Oh, well...

187
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:17,352
Cutting off her nipples
with a pair of garden shears.

188
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:19,290
You call that normal?

189
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:22,523
My God. Garden shears.

190
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:26,897
No, but she's not, you know.
Doctor says she's neurotic.

191
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:30,170
- It will take time, that's all.
- Time?

192
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,299
It's been three years
since she had that baby.

193
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,937
So it died...

194
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:39,344
...but that was three years ago.

195
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,780
She's not getting any better.
She's just getting worse.

196
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:50,022
Do you think she has any idea about us?

197
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:52,089
No.

198
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:55,889
Well, I hope not.

199
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,590
I like Alison.

200
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,516
Look...

201
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,779
...now that Alison's gone home...

202
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:20,446
...you two don't mind
if I do a little work, do you?

203
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:22,888
Play a couple of hands with us.

204
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,585
Well, I got my lecture to prepare.

205
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,252
You work too hard, Weldon.

206
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:29,695
Why don't you come
riding with us tomorrow?

207
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,834
Well, we'll see.

208
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,936
It will do you good. Shake up your liver.

209
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,594
Well, I might. I might.

210
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,379
Blackjack.

211
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,293
Good night, Weldon.

212
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:38,057
But I don't need a suit, Anacleto.

213
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:40,059
But you do.

214
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,131
You haven't bought a garment
in more than a year...

215
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,997
...and the green frock
is <i>bien usée</i> at the elbow...

216
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,606
...and ready for the Salvation Army.

217
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,950
My God, you're a rare bird, you are.

218
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,347
How much is it?

219
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,616
What I wouldn't give to get you
in my battalion for just a day.

220
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,552
It is <i>très cher.</i>

221
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,926
But one could not expect
to get such quality for anything else.

222
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:21,261
- And think of the years of service.
- We'll see about it.

223
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:24,134
Oh, go on and buy the dress,
for God's sake.

224
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:28,107
And while we are about it,
we might order an extra yard or so.

225
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:29,540
Then I can have a jacket.

226
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:33,740
All right, if I decide to get it.

227
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:08,844
What is that?

228
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:13,779
You and Captain Weincheck were playing it
last Thursday afternoon.

229
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:21,715
The opening bar of the Franck
A-major sonata.

230
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,756
Look.

231
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:27,326
Just this minute
made me compose a ballet.

232
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:31,098
Black velvet curtains.

233
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:35,495
And a glow like winter twilight.

234
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:41,110
Very slowly with the whole cast.

235
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,309
Then a spotlight follows solo like a flame.

236
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:48,974
Very dashing.

237
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:54,513
And with the waltz...

238
00:29:56,426 --> 00:30:00,123
...Mr. Sergei Rachmaninoff play.

239
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:03,424
Bravo, bravo, Anacleto.

240
00:30:33,229 --> 00:30:34,992
Did he hurt himself?

241
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,792
I'm all right, Madame Alison.

242
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,957
I wish you had broken your damn neck.

243
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:32,043
Williams, bring out Firebird.
The lady is here.

244
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:36,149
I believe if a horse really
wants to throw you, well, he will.

245
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:38,851
But I think most of the time
they're just feeling good.

246
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,256
They're just having fun.

247
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,763
Well, now, you take Firebird.
The minute he starts to feel me slip...

248
00:31:43,933 --> 00:31:47,369
...he stops messing around.
Of course, he's a gentleman.

249
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:49,937
There's my sweet old baby.

250
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:16,192
Quit that.

251
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:34,314
If the major could see himself from behind,
he would never get on a horse.

252
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:40,181
You see, this uncle of mine
had this cabin up in the mountains...

253
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:43,291
...and my brothers and I
used to go up all the time to hunt.

254
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,328
About six of us would go out
in the afternoon with our dogs.

255
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,466
Oh, really more the evening.
My God, it would be cold.

256
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,828
A little colored boy
would be running behind...

257
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:55,937
...with a big jug of liquor
on his back.

258
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:58,767
Sometimes we'd be in the mountains
all night hunting coon.

259
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,773
I just can't tell you what it was like.

260
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,380
- What do you want?
- May I take out the black mare?

261
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,177
- Did you do all your stalls?
- Yeah.

262
00:33:09,352 --> 00:33:10,842
Okay.

263
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:48,657
- You all right, Weldon?
- Incompetent brute.

264
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,350
It's not the horse's fault. It's yours.

265
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:56,465
I mean, you can't expect a horse
to take a jump if you don't ride him at it.

266
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,603
- Weldon, that's Private Williams, isn't it?
- It certainly is.

267
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:38,240
Bare back to bare ass.

268
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:39,932
It's outrageous.

269
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:41,770
You go on ahead. I'll attend to him.

270
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,776
Oh, what, spoil his fun?

271
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:47,781
I thought all that old mare could do
is stumble and shamble...

272
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,579
...but look at her move now.
Would you look at that?

273
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:54,814
Now that boy can horseback.
He's got a great pair of hands.

274
00:34:54,991 --> 00:34:57,221
A disgrace.

275
00:34:57,393 --> 00:35:00,157
Oh, come off it, Weldon.

276
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:06,724
Leonora.

277
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:12,226
Leonora, come on. Get up.

278
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:15,803
Get up.

279
00:36:21,544 --> 00:36:23,774
Come on. Get up.

280
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:25,573
Go on to bed.

281
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:28,206
Come on.

282
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:32,320
Go on up to bed now.

283
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:56,445
Sure you're not sleepy?

284
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,853
Oh, no, Madame Alison.

285
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,717
I had a nap this afternoon.

286
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:06,088
And I dreamt about Catherine.

287
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:11,365
What was it you dreamed?

288
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,137
Rather like...

289
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:20,074
...holding a butterfly in my hands.

290
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:23,912
And I was nursing her in my lap.

291
00:41:25,348 --> 00:41:27,816
Then the dream changed.

292
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,214
Instead of Catherine...

293
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:34,982
...I had on my knees
one of the colonel's riding boots.

294
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:37,988
The boot...

295
00:41:38,761 --> 00:41:42,822
...was full of squirming
newly born mice...

296
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:46,059
...and I was trying to keep them in.

297
00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:50,902
Keep them from crawling up
all over me.

298
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,105
Anacleto, please.

299
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:03,776
Dreams.

300
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:08,813
They are strange things to think about.

301
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,893
In the afternoons in the Philippines...

302
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:14,996
...when the pillow is damp...

303
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:19,123
...and the sun shines in the room...

304
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:24,164
...the dream is of another sort...

305
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:26,636
...than in the north.

306
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,470
At night...

307
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:33,513
...when it is snowing, then it is...

308
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:41,089
Look.

309
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,420
A peacock.

310
00:42:52,968 --> 00:42:55,198
A sort of ghastly green...

311
00:42:56,405 --> 00:43:00,739
...with one immense golden eye.

312
00:43:01,644 --> 00:43:03,578
And in it...

313
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:10,351
...these reflections of something
tiny and...

314
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,953
Tiny and...

315
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,755
Grotesque.

316
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,458
Exactly.

317
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:55,512
Oh, charming.

318
00:45:59,955 --> 00:46:01,616
Aren't they pretty?

319
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,258
I haven't seen any since I was a girl.

320
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:08,157
I remember these
and a crystal paperweight...

321
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:12,232
...that made a snowstorm
when you shook it.

322
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:17,196
Anacleto, are you happy?

323
00:46:17,373 --> 00:46:20,831
Why, certainly, when you are well.

324
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:30,815
Madame Alison,
do yourself really believe...

325
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:36,390
...that Mr. Sergei Rachmaninoff knows
that a chair is something to be sat on...

326
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,924
...and that the clock
shows one the time?

327
00:46:39,094 --> 00:46:41,528
And if I should
take off my shoe...

328
00:46:41,697 --> 00:46:43,858
...and hold it up to his face and say:

329
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:47,298
"What is this,
Mr. Sergei Rachmaninoff?"

330
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:50,028
Then he would answer like anyone else:

331
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:54,266
"Why, Anacleto, that is a shoe.

332
00:46:54,443 --> 00:46:58,072
I myself find it hard to realize."

333
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:06,852
I could have knocked
on that door downstairs until doomsday...

334
00:47:07,022 --> 00:47:10,583
...before either one of you would have
heard me over all that music.

335
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,488
Oh, thank you.

336
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,754
Alison, how are you?

337
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:18,895
I didn't sleep at all last night.

338
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:21,662
Oh, I am sorry.

339
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:23,998
Well, you just take
a good nap this afternoon...

340
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:26,971
...because you just gotta make it
for tonight.

341
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:30,805
- Make what?
- For God's sakes, Alison, my party.

342
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:34,506
I've been working like a fool for three days
getting everything ready.

343
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:37,413
Why, I don't give a party
like this but twice a year.

344
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:40,487
Of course. It just slipped my mind
for the moment.

345
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:42,954
Listen. Here's the way it's gonna go.

346
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,389
I'm gonna put
all the leaves in the table...

347
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:49,622
...so everybody can just kind of mill around
and help themselves.

348
00:47:49,965 --> 00:47:52,934
I have two baked Virginia hams...

349
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:59,041
...one huge turkey, fried chicken,
cold sliced pork...

350
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:02,905
...and plenty of barbecued spareribs,
and all kinds of little knickknacks...

351
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:08,345
...like, oh, pickled onions
and olives and radishes.

352
00:48:08,517 --> 00:48:12,078
Oh, and we're going to start off
by serving hot rolls...

353
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:15,553
...and hot little cheese biscuits
and stuff like that.

354
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:18,318
Oh, and I'm gonna have
the punch bowl in the corner.

355
00:48:18,494 --> 00:48:21,952
And for those that like their liquor straight
I'll have on the sideboard...

356
00:48:22,131 --> 00:48:24,395
...eight bottles of Kentucky bourbon...

357
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:26,124
...five of rye...

358
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:28,360
...five of scotch...

359
00:48:28,537 --> 00:48:31,563
Oh, and listen, I'm bringing in
an entertainer from out of town...

360
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,935
...who will play the accordion,
and later on...

361
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,771
But who on earth
is going to eat all that food?

362
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:39,209
Well, the whole shebang.
I've invited everybody...

363
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,315
...from Old Sugar and his wife on down.

364
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:45,010
Leonora, how can you call
a commanding general "Old Sugar"?

365
00:48:45,187 --> 00:48:49,624
Oh, Alison, I've known Julius
practically all my life.

366
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:52,784
Why, he was my daddy's chief of staff.

367
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,486
Oh, Alison, I wanna ask you a favor.

368
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:59,930
Do you think Anacleto
could please serve the punch for me?

369
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,763
Well, I'm sure Anacleto
would be delighted.

370
00:49:05,941 --> 00:49:07,704
Oh, thank you, honey.

371
00:49:18,654 --> 00:49:21,646
Oh, and Susie's two brothers
are helping out in the kitchen.

372
00:49:21,824 --> 00:49:25,260
- I've never seen anything to equal it.
- By the way, is Susie married?

373
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:29,693
Susie? Oh, good heavens, no.
She won't have anything to do with men.

374
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:32,356
She was caught when she was
about 14 years old...

375
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,593
...and she's never forgotten. But why?

376
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:43,401
I was almost sure I saw someone
come out of your house by the back door...

377
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:44,807
...just before dawn.

378
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,716
You just imagined it, honey.

379
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:55,622
Perhaps so.

380
00:49:56,692 --> 00:49:59,252
- Alison?
- Yes.

381
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,293
I hope you'll forgive my saying this...

382
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:05,995
...but I really don't see
how you're gonna get any better...

383
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:09,331
...staying in this dark room all day long.

384
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:12,872
Now, whenever I'm sick
or tired or nervous...

385
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:16,977
...I get on the back of a horse
and I ride myself better.

386
00:50:17,145 --> 00:50:19,545
Now, I know you could do
the same thing.

387
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:22,980
I know you can ride. Why, you told me
you used to foxhunt, didn't you?

388
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:24,709
Yes.

389
00:50:25,354 --> 00:50:28,414
Did I ever tell you about the time
I was out foxhunting...

390
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,118
...with a 13-year-old girl, the whipper-in,
and she broke her neck?

391
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:37,356
Yes, you have told me every
terrible detail five times.

392
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:41,292
Your lunch, Madame Alison.

393
00:50:42,204 --> 00:50:44,434
Oh, lunchtime? I've gotta go...

394
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:46,733
...but listen,
I'll see you later on tonight...

395
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,536
...and you be there at 4:30, okay?

396
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,407
Now, don't you see me out to the door.
I'll see you later, honey, okay? Bye-bye!

397
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,060
Anacleto,
I am going to divorce the colonel.

398
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:20,839
Madame Alison,
where shall we go after that?

399
00:51:23,378 --> 00:51:26,245
That I have not yet decided.

400
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:31,277
- Do you think we might live in a hotel?
- It's a possibility.

401
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:34,217
Or we could run
a prawn boat somewhere.

402
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:35,856
We could live on the boat.

403
00:51:37,826 --> 00:51:39,589
How much money
do you have in the bank?

404
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:42,229
$425.06.

405
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:44,098
Do you want me to draw it out?

406
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:47,724
No, not now,
but we might need it later.

407
00:57:09,424 --> 00:57:13,986
I'll kill you,
you dirty bastard.

408
00:57:45,493 --> 00:57:47,484
Please.

409
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:54,265
Oh, God.

410
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,795
My daddy was an eight-goal man.

411
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:03,233
I got up to four goals once myself.

412
00:59:03,405 --> 00:59:06,897
Leonora, they let a lady play polo?

413
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:08,440
Why, sure, sometimes.

414
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,373
And I was pretty good.

415
00:59:10,545 --> 00:59:13,241
Of course, my daddy
was Old Leatherbreeches.

416
00:59:14,282 --> 00:59:16,273
We were stationed at Fort Myer
at the time.

417
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:18,544
The men thought
they'd have to accommodate me.

418
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,880
You know, a girl playing.

419
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:21,682
Well, I taught them a thing or two.

420
00:59:21,856 --> 00:59:26,190
Before the first chukker was over
they had to carry two of them off the field.

421
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:28,124
I just had to go and ride them off...

422
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:30,389
- Good evening, colonel.
- How are you, captain?

423
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:31,964
Fine. Fine, thank you.

424
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:35,364
Anacleto tells me that Mrs. Langdon
will not be here this evening.

425
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:38,335
No, she's not feeling well.

426
00:59:38,506 --> 00:59:41,475
I wonder, would it be all right
if I ran over for a few minutes?

427
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:43,873
Sure. You go on over there.

428
00:59:44,045 --> 00:59:46,570
Listen to me.
There's nothing wrong with her...

429
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:48,545
- Where's Weldon?
- Yeah, where is Weldon?

430
00:59:48,716 --> 00:59:51,412
Go on over and talk to her.
She'll be real glad to see you.

431
00:59:51,586 --> 00:59:53,178
- Run along.
- Thank you, sir.

432
00:59:53,354 --> 00:59:55,481
Can't you see him?
Trudging down the highway...

433
00:59:55,657 --> 00:59:59,058
...the stick over his shoulder
and his precious Clausewitz in a bandana.

434
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:01,252
Who? Who?

435
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,294
My husband.

436
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:24,048
My horse threw me and then ran away.

437
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:25,618
Yes, sir, I know.

438
01:00:25,787 --> 01:00:29,587
Private Williams found him
and brought him in.

439
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,918
- He here?
- Yes, sir.

440
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:34,994
He's in the stall with Firebird.

441
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:01,343
Oh, sounds like a good party.

442
01:02:01,986 --> 01:02:04,887
It's probably the last party
I'll attend on this post.

443
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,988
- Or any other.
- Why, Murray...

444
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,687
Penderton called me in this afternoon.

445
01:02:13,164 --> 01:02:16,565
He said, "I want you to know
what I'm doing, Weincheck.

446
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,331
I can't, in all conscience,
give you better than satisfactory...

447
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:23,632
...on your efficiency report."

448
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:26,299
It was quite a blow.

449
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:31,708
He went on. He said,
"It's not that you're remiss in your duties.

450
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:36,410
It's just that you lack
certain qualities of leadership."

451
01:02:37,622 --> 01:02:38,611
Oh, dear.

452
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:42,350
So I said, "In that case,
I'm leaving the service."

453
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:46,018
And Penderton said, "I hoped that
that would be your reaction, Weincheck...

454
01:02:46,197 --> 01:02:49,758
...because frankly, I don't see much
of a future for you in the Army."

455
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:53,929
He said he was really doing me a favor.

456
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:55,663
Well, maybe he was.

457
01:02:57,108 --> 01:02:58,336
Hey, what's the joke?

458
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:01,910
The little Filipino put perfume
in a specimen of Alison Langdon's urine...

459
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,048
...before taking it
to the hospital for analysis.

460
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:08,374
- Who says?
- You know something else?

461
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:10,713
The same boy got through
one day to the general.

462
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:12,879
He asked the general
to stop the soldier...

463
01:03:13,057 --> 01:03:15,389
...from blowing his bugle
at 6:00 in the morning...

464
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:18,289
...because it disturbed
Mrs. Langdon's rest.

465
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,794
The general said,
"You know who you're talking to?"

466
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,193
He said, "Of course."

467
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:27,527
He was trying to say "house boy"
in French.

468
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:49,620
Weldon?

469
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:52,323
Weldon?

470
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:04,274
What in the world happened to you?

471
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:10,174
Well, the horse...

472
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:13,613
The horse stumbled,
and I fell into a blackberry bush.

473
01:04:13,784 --> 01:04:15,649
He ran off, and...

474
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:19,555
Oh, my.

475
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:23,389
Well, you are a mess.

476
01:04:25,396 --> 01:04:28,388
What horse were you riding?

477
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:31,967
What horse were you riding?

478
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:33,763
Firebird.

479
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:37,272
Firebird?

480
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:40,410
What in the world
were you doing on him?

481
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:44,709
You know you can't horseback
well enough to ride him.

482
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,681
You say he ran away?

483
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:49,911
Is he loose?

484
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,511
Well...

485
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,593
Well, he found his...
He found his way back to the stable.

486
01:04:57,762 --> 01:04:59,730
Well, how is he?

487
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,823
He's all right.

488
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:08,029
Are you sure he's all right?

489
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:10,196
Yeah.

490
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:13,109
Any cuts on him?

491
01:05:15,813 --> 01:05:17,940
No, he's all right.

492
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:38,994
Who beat him?

493
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:44,301
Nobody here, ma'am.

494
01:05:46,544 --> 01:05:50,571
Oh, that son of a bitch.

495
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:02,289
Well, certainly, horse cavalry is a thing
of the past, but that's not the point.

496
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,021
The point is that polo playing
is great trainership...

497
01:06:06,197 --> 01:06:10,395
Training for the leadership of an officer.
That's what I say.

498
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:13,128
And the polo grounds
have produced more great leaders...

499
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:16,239
...than the playing fields of Eton anytime.

500
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:18,500
Pershing played polo, didn't he, general?

501
01:06:18,676 --> 01:06:20,268
- Patton played polo.
- Summerall.

502
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:21,433
- MacArthur.
- Right.

503
01:06:21,612 --> 01:06:23,273
- Devers.
- Terry Allen.

504
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:27,247
Right. It's just a damn shame that
a country as rich and powerful as ours...

505
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:31,514
...can't spend a few dollars
to buy some oats for some horses.

506
01:06:38,963 --> 01:06:42,091
So Firebird's all right, is he?

507
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:46,366
You lousy bastard...

508
01:06:46,537 --> 01:06:50,940
...beating my horse, my Firebird!

509
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,303
What did Major Penderton do?

510
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,502
He stood like a statue.

511
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,647
He did not defend himself.

512
01:06:57,815 --> 01:07:01,012
She struck him time and again...

513
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:04,586
...as hard as she could,
right across the face.

514
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:08,191
His face was already torn
from the riding accident...

515
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:11,055
...which made it all the more horrible.

516
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,128
Was she drunk?

517
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:16,733
Everybody thought so, but she wasn't.

518
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:22,032
I should know. I was the barman.
I dispensed the drinks.

519
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:26,636
- Are you sleepy, Madame Alison?
- Not at all.

520
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,576
Shall I get our watercolors
so we paint for a while?

521
01:07:30,748 --> 01:07:34,275
- If you like.
- I shall be back suddenly.

522
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,352
- Soon.
- Oh, yes, soon.

523
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:39,984
Excuse me, colonel.

524
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:46,729
Are...? Are you asleep, my dear?

525
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,831
Yes. Dead asleep.

526
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:52,992
Well, my God.

527
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,730
What a... What a debacle.

528
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,306
I've heard all I want to hear
from Anacleto.

529
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,517
Well, my dear,
you should have been there.

530
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:09,983
Mercifully, I wasn't.

531
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:14,417
Well...

532
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:17,152
...just a little kiss.

533
01:08:17,328 --> 01:08:20,263
Kiss you night-night.

534
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:22,763
Good night, Morris.

535
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,816
Thirty, 17.

536
01:09:46,984 --> 01:09:49,316
Couldn't get my breath.

537
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:51,911
I couldn't breathe.

538
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:55,650
It's all right. I am here.

539
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,836
Thank you, sergeant.

540
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:21,273
Parade, hut!

541
01:11:23,514 --> 01:11:26,506
Code 10, hut!

542
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:29,914
Parade present!

543
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:34,148
Order!

544
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:36,986
Report!

545
01:11:38,262 --> 01:11:40,628
Order!

546
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:45,726
She keeps imagining all these things,
you know?

547
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:49,839
Yesterday, she thought
the house was on fire.

548
01:11:50,007 --> 01:11:51,907
Said she could smell smoke.

549
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,566
Then this morning when I was home...

550
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:58,108
...she swore up and down
she could hear some kid screaming.

551
01:11:58,282 --> 01:12:01,683
There had been an accident with a car...

552
01:12:01,852 --> 01:12:07,051
...and she said Anacleto and I have
to go around and ask all the neighbors.

553
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,660
So we did. I felt like a damn fool.

554
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:14,125
How's it going with you and Weldon?

555
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:17,461
Better. A lot better. A hell of a lot better.

556
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:19,033
Why, he's a changed boy.

557
01:12:19,203 --> 01:12:22,263
He's even polite to me when we're alone.

558
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:23,963
I guess I shouldn't have done it.

559
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:28,771
But what the hell.
He had it coming, beating my horse.

560
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:32,407
I guess everybody thinks
I was drunk, don't they?

561
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,676
I guess so.

562
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:38,686
You know, it's a damn
good thing for Weldon.

563
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:44,257
A damn lucky thing the general
used to bounce you on his knee, because...

564
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:46,259
If Alison pulled a stunt like that...

565
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,365
...I'd get transferred so fast
it would make your hair grow.

566
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:53,060
Well, now, Alison wouldn't do
a thing like that, now, would she?

567
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:56,365
No. Hey, the fights are tonight.

568
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,907
- You wanna go to the fights?
- Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

569
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,109
What's so damn funny?

570
01:13:10,287 --> 01:13:14,053
Weldon said he fell in a blackberry patch.

571
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:20,220
Can you imagine?
Of all things, a blackberry patch.

572
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:42,810
- «i»between Corporal Jose Fernandez</i>
<i>in black trunks...</i>

573
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:49,414
<i>...and Private First Class Harry Higby</i>
<i>in white trunks.</i>

574
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,502
Oh, hit him back! Come on.

575
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:14,944
Come on!

576
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,488
No!

577
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:23,217
Get up!

578
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:24,860
Get up!

579
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,892
Get up!

580
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:34,060
No! I don't believe it.

581
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:38,003
Well, I think I'll be going along now.
I'm going back to the office.

582
01:14:38,175 --> 01:14:40,405
The office this time of night?
You crazy?

583
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:43,603
I've got a lot of work to do,
finish up. I'll see y'all later.

584
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,941
Have someone drive you there
and wait for you.

585
01:14:46,116 --> 01:14:48,516
No, thanks, Morris.
I think the walk will do me good.

586
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:51,620
- I'll see y'all later. Bye.
- All right.

587
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:55,349
- He's still down.
- Oh, he's all right.

588
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:00,322
Hey, mister, over here.

589
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,731
I'll tell you what...

590
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:06,726
- I'll tell you what I'll do.
- Yeah.

591
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:10,270
- If he buys the food then I'll buy the drinks.
- Come on.

592
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:16,293
Morris?

593
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:41,685
I think you had better go up
to your wife's room.

594
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,689
She's not alone.

595
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,420
My husband is with her.

596
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:52,961
Alison, you shouldn't be wandering
around like this. I'll take you home.

597
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:56,196
You don't mean to sit there
and tell me you know this...

598
01:17:56,373 --> 01:17:58,807
...and do nothing about it?

599
01:18:47,324 --> 01:18:48,951
Alison.

600
01:18:50,594 --> 01:18:52,186
Alison.

601
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:59,565
I went to see where you were,
and you weren't there.

602
01:19:04,107 --> 01:19:06,041
Where have you been?

603
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,206
There's something you should know.

604
01:19:11,381 --> 01:19:14,680
Leonora isn't only
deceiving her husband.

605
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:19,151
She's deceiving you too,
with an enlisted man.

606
01:19:19,322 --> 01:19:21,222
Furthermore, I'm going to get a divorce.

607
01:19:21,391 --> 01:19:25,953
And as I have no money, I would appreciate
your lending me the sum of $500.

608
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:28,290
I will pay you back
at five percent interest...

609
01:19:28,465 --> 01:19:31,127
...with Anacleto and Captain Weincheck
as guarantors.

610
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:33,929
You need not feel any further
responsibility toward me.

611
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:37,972
Anacleto and I will go into some business
together or buy a prawn boat, maybe.

612
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:41,838
And now will you please help him
bring my trunk up from the cellar?

613
01:19:42,012 --> 01:19:44,674
We have to pack and be out of here
early tomorrow morning.

614
01:20:24,621 --> 01:20:27,419
I just remembered, Anacleto.

615
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:30,320
Moltrieville, South Carolina.

616
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,257
It's beautiful and small.

617
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,558
I went there once
when I was 7 to visit a great-aunt.

618
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:38,325
My great-aunt Evelyn.

619
01:20:38,902 --> 01:20:42,668
It's near Charleston. It is on the sea...

620
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:46,331
...and the people are most civilized.

621
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,275
Bring the timetables.

622
01:20:48,445 --> 01:20:50,538
Where are they?

623
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:56,178
Good.

624
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:59,720
Columbia. Columbia.

625
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:01,220
10:20.

626
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:06,726
We shall leave this house forever
at 8 in the morning.

627
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:11,361
That will give us plenty of time to buy
the tickets and get the Pullman seats.

628
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,502
Oh, Anacleto.

629
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,695
We will want a picnic basket.

630
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:18,500
I do not care for Pullman fare.

631
01:21:18,675 --> 01:21:19,903
Oh, what shall we do?

632
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:23,443
But Madame Alison,
today I bought a <i>poussin.</i>

633
01:21:23,613 --> 01:21:26,081
- I shall go and prepare it now.
- And hard-boiled eggs.

634
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:29,184
- And sweet pickles.
- Yeah.

635
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:37,750
Colonel Kelly, please.

636
01:21:38,695 --> 01:21:41,664
Hey, where were you last night?

637
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,433
Got something going for you, huh?

638
01:21:46,603 --> 01:21:49,128
Him? You kidding?

639
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:54,805
His daddy told him
women carry a terrible disease...

640
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,079
...and you mustn't ever touch them.

641
01:21:57,247 --> 01:22:00,978
L.G.'s a virgin. Ain't you, L.G.?

642
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:15,094
Our doctor's from Walter Reed.
You know, Colonel Kelly.

643
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:18,496
But after he looked at her
he said he had to bring in another doctor.

644
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:20,465
Some psychiatrist.

645
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:24,236
And it was...

646
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,973
...plain awful.

647
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:32,307
I just felt so damn ashamed for her.

648
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:37,181
They were lighting matches
and holding them up in front of her face...

649
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:39,913
...and asking her all kinds of questions...

650
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,216
...and Anacleto kept interfering.

651
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:45,418
We had to lock him up in his room.

652
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:49,265
She wouldn't cooperate
with them, anyway.

653
01:22:49,432 --> 01:22:51,730
So...

654
01:22:52,669 --> 01:22:55,001
...finally, they said...

655
01:22:56,473 --> 01:22:58,634
Said we have to send her away to a...

656
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,204
To a sanitarium.

657
01:23:04,214 --> 01:23:07,183
And I said, "Now, listen.
I don't want her in some place...

658
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,513
...where they're gonna have straitjackets.

659
01:23:10,687 --> 01:23:12,848
None of that stuff.

660
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:15,349
Just...

661
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:19,326
...someplace where she can be quiet
and comfortable...

662
01:23:21,064 --> 01:23:25,899
...and listen to her records if she wants to
and have a room for Anacleto."

663
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:31,307
So they said they know
an institution that's in Virginia...

664
01:23:31,474 --> 01:23:33,601
...that's just like a luxury hotel.

665
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:36,370
How soon?

666
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:40,340
Well...

667
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:44,044
...as soon as they make
the arrangements, whatever they do.

668
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,527
Good afternoon. No, don't get up.
I'm Dr. Burgess.

669
01:25:04,701 --> 01:25:07,135
Welcome to our small community.

670
01:25:07,303 --> 01:25:09,237
Will you be staying overnight, colonel?

671
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:12,272
No. No, I have to get right back.

672
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:15,969
Well, you may be sure
we'll take good care of Mrs. Langdon.

673
01:25:16,145 --> 01:25:17,772
You won't be getting up tomorrow.

674
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:21,508
You'll stay in bed,
and we'll start making you well again.

675
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:31,985
Well...

676
01:25:32,562 --> 01:25:34,052
...it's a nice place, isn't it?

677
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:37,622
Alcoholics.

678
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:39,724
Senility.

679
01:25:39,902 --> 01:25:41,961
Paresis.

680
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:45,207
Oh, my God.

681
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,900
What a choice crew.

682
01:25:55,485 --> 01:25:58,318
Soldier, pick up that cigarette butt.
Fieldstrip it.

683
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,251
A soldier is a soldier 24 hours a day.

684
01:26:00,423 --> 01:26:01,822
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

685
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:03,856
Soldier.
Who checked you out of barracks?

686
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,826
Why is that pocket unbuttoned?
Button it.

687
01:26:08,031 --> 01:26:09,521
When did you blitz that buckle?

688
01:26:09,699 --> 01:26:11,826
- Don't you have any shoe polish?
- Yes, sir.

689
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:15,664
- Report to the orderly room right away.
- Yes, sir.

690
01:26:19,509 --> 01:26:21,739
Major. Major Penderton.

691
01:26:21,911 --> 01:26:23,674
Major Penderton, have you heard?

692
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:27,475
- Heard what?
- Alison. Mrs. Langdon. She's dead.

693
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:30,118
No, no. No, no. I haven't heard.

694
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:31,514
What? What?

695
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:34,589
Alison. Mrs. Langdon. She's dead.

696
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:38,386
- Well, but the... The colonel isn't back yet.
- No, he's on the noon train.

697
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:41,655
It was a coronary.
It happened just after he left, it seems.

698
01:26:41,831 --> 01:26:44,664
We received a telegram
at division headquarters. We opened it.

699
01:26:44,834 --> 01:26:47,564
We didn't know
what was in it, naturally.

700
01:26:48,137 --> 01:26:50,162
Alison?

701
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,622
I'm almost finished, Morris.

702
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,472
Why not give them to Weincheck?
All these records.

703
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:30,203
He'd be happy to have them.

704
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:35,317
Oh, I think I'll keep them
over in my room.

705
01:27:35,485 --> 01:27:37,953
I might wanna play them sometime.

706
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:41,147
Oh, now, Morris,
you know you hate classical records.

707
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:43,087
Don't talk like that. It's...

708
01:27:43,259 --> 01:27:45,955
Well, it's morbid.

709
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:53,766
Well, she gave that little thing to Anacleto,
and he kept it up here.

710
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:59,205
Damn, I wish he'd come back.

711
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:04,279
Strange he didn't show up
at the funeral, isn't it?

712
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:10,144
He just packed up all her things and got out
of that hospital the morning after she died.

713
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,221
Just... Just disappeared.

714
01:28:15,258 --> 01:28:17,385
Funny, isn't it?

715
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:22,162
You know, I never told you this...

716
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,059
...but when Catherine was born...

717
01:28:25,935 --> 01:28:29,371
...Alison had a hell of a time of it.

718
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,837
Thirty-three hours in labor.

719
01:28:32,008 --> 01:28:34,499
Thirty-three solid hours.

720
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:40,013
When it got so I couldn't stand to listen
to her anymore... Screaming, you know?

721
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:42,583
You know who she hung on to?

722
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,913
Anacleto.

723
01:28:45,288 --> 01:28:47,256
Yeah.

724
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:50,658
The little Filipino was there...

725
01:28:51,127 --> 01:28:53,925
...sweat pouring down his face.

726
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:57,031
Doctor told her she wasn't
bearing down hard enough, so he'd...

727
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,363
He'd bear down right along with her.

728
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:04,766
Bending his knees.
Screaming when she'd scream.

729
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:14,415
Hell.

730
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:19,649
Leonora, I didn't know
there was anything wrong with her.

731
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:23,690
I mean, I didn't know
she was really sick.

732
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,328
I just thought she was...

733
01:29:28,097 --> 01:29:29,860
I didn't realize, that's all.

734
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,557
Of course you didn't realize.

735
01:29:32,735 --> 01:29:36,193
Nobody did.

736
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:41,499
Well...

737
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:44,972
...I guess there's just
two things left for me now:

738
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:49,208
Keep myself fit and do my job.
Serve my country.

739
01:29:51,888 --> 01:29:53,651
Only two things?

740
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:59,320
Only two things?

741
01:30:05,201 --> 01:30:07,169
No.

742
01:30:09,305 --> 01:30:11,739
Not here, now.

743
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:17,003
I'll tell you what let's do.
Let's go riding.

744
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:20,382
May be some blackberries left.

745
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:14,792
Now, a man does not flee because...

746
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:17,064
...he's fighting in an unjust cause.

747
01:31:17,239 --> 01:31:21,198
He does not attack
because his cause is just.

748
01:31:21,377 --> 01:31:27,873
He flees because he's the weaker,
and he conquers because he's the stronger.

749
01:31:28,684 --> 01:31:33,951
Or more to the point,
because his leaders made him feel stronger.

750
01:31:40,896 --> 01:31:42,830
Rommel...

751
01:31:43,733 --> 01:31:46,293
...Patton, Marshall, MacArthur. They...

752
01:31:46,469 --> 01:31:48,562
They had it.

753
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:55,743
How did they...?

754
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:59,745
How did they make their troops
believe that they were stronger?

755
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:05,881
Leadership is intangible.

756
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:11,821
It's hard to measure, difficult to describe.

757
01:32:15,598 --> 01:32:19,432
Leadership must include
a measure of inherent ability...

758
01:32:19,602 --> 01:32:25,234
...to control and direct self-confidence...

759
01:32:25,408 --> 01:32:30,311
...based on initiative,
loyalty to superiors...

760
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,505
...and a sense of pride.

761
01:32:36,619 --> 01:32:38,780
Pride.

762
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:52,057
It's far easier to recognize a leader...

763
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:57,638
...than to define leadership in clear
and in universally understood terms.

764
01:33:01,377 --> 01:33:03,368
Now...

765
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:08,647
Is leadership learned?

766
01:33:08,818 --> 01:33:10,979
Is it taught?

767
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:17,617
Is a man born with it?

768
01:33:25,201 --> 01:33:27,897
How did it come to Patton?

769
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,656
Class dismissed.

770
01:34:15,184 --> 01:34:17,243
Sergeant.

771
01:34:19,288 --> 01:34:20,949
Afternoon, Major Penderton.

772
01:34:21,123 --> 01:34:22,920
I'll have the black mare.

773
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:25,993
Sorry, sir. Williams has her out.

774
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:28,528
Well, saddle any horse then.
It doesn't matter.

775
01:34:28,697 --> 01:34:30,790
Yes, sir.

776
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:58,719
Blackjack.

777
01:34:58,894 --> 01:35:00,657
Damn.

778
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:03,093
You know, I used to tease
Anacleto all the time...

779
01:35:03,265 --> 01:35:05,893
...about what I'd do to him
if I got him in a battalion.

780
01:35:06,068 --> 01:35:07,831
Of course, I was kidding him mostly...

781
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:11,871
...but I think if he'd joined the Army, that
would have been the best thing for him.

782
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,702
He certainly would be flattered...

783
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:16,538
...if he could hear the way
you carry on about him now.

784
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:19,374
He wouldn't have been
happy in the Army...

785
01:35:19,548 --> 01:35:21,573
...but it might have made
a man out of him.

786
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:25,311
Knocked some of that nonsense
out of him, anyway.

787
01:35:26,121 --> 01:35:28,612
It is a pretty awful thing
to see a grown-up man...

788
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:33,421
...dancing around on his toes
to some kind of silly music...

789
01:35:33,596 --> 01:35:38,090
...and painting all kind of funny-looking
pictures with watercolors.

790
01:35:38,267 --> 01:35:41,964
Oh, we'd have run him ragged
in the Army, all right.

791
01:35:42,671 --> 01:35:45,799
He sure would have been miserable...

792
01:35:45,975 --> 01:35:51,072
...but I think anything would be better
than all that... All that other mess.

793
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:02,055
Any fulfillment obtained
at the expense of normality is wrong...

794
01:36:02,658 --> 01:36:06,560
...and should not be allowed
to bring happiness.

795
01:36:07,196 --> 01:36:09,790
In short, it's a...

796
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:14,630
It's better,
because it's morally honorable...

797
01:36:14,803 --> 01:36:19,570
...for the square peg to keep
scraping about in a round hole...

798
01:36:19,742 --> 01:36:26,238
...rather than to discover and use
the unorthodox one that would fit it.

799
01:36:29,218 --> 01:36:33,314
Well, yeah, that's right, Weldon.

800
01:36:33,489 --> 01:36:35,923
Don't you agree with me?

801
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:42,694
No.

802
01:36:45,934 --> 01:36:48,129
No, I don't.

803
01:36:51,807 --> 01:36:53,934
Excuse me.

804
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:01,407
Oh, Weldon.

805
01:37:04,386 --> 01:37:06,911
Poor Rufus.

806
01:37:07,089 --> 01:37:10,820
I've had him ever since
I was in boarding school.

807
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:13,894
Now you've broken him...

808
01:37:14,763 --> 01:37:16,993
...after all these years.

809
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,896
I'm sorry, Leonora.
It's just all this clutter is...

810
01:37:20,069 --> 01:37:23,470
What's the matter with clutter?
I like it.

811
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,776
Well...

812
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:32,875
...I'd rather live without it.

813
01:37:34,183 --> 01:37:36,617
Bare floors. Plain white walls.

814
01:37:36,785 --> 01:37:38,878
No window curtains. Nothing but essentials.

815
01:37:39,054 --> 01:37:42,546
If that's the way you feel about it,
why don't you resign your commission...

816
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:44,852
...and start over again
as an enlisted man?

817
01:37:46,362 --> 01:37:47,727
Of course you're laughing...

818
01:37:47,896 --> 01:37:51,423
...but there's much to be said
for the life of men among men...

819
01:37:52,434 --> 01:37:58,100
...with no luxuries, no ornamentation.

820
01:37:58,273 --> 01:38:00,764
Utter simplicity.

821
01:38:01,377 --> 01:38:04,141
It's rough and it's coarse, perhaps,
but it's also clean.

822
01:38:04,313 --> 01:38:05,746
It's clean as a rifle.

823
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:10,550
There's no speck of dust inside or out...

824
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:14,450
...and it's immaculate in its hard,
young fitness.

825
01:38:14,623 --> 01:38:17,751
Its chivalry.

826
01:38:19,128 --> 01:38:21,892
They're seldom
out of one another's sight.

827
01:38:22,064 --> 01:38:26,694
They eat, and they train,
and they shower, and they play jokes...

828
01:38:26,869 --> 01:38:28,461
...and go to the brothel together.

829
01:38:28,637 --> 01:38:31,367
They sleep side by side.

830
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:37,167
The barracks room offers many a lesson
in courtesy and how not to give offense.

831
01:38:37,346 --> 01:38:40,144
They guard the next man's privacy
as though it was their own.

832
01:38:42,618 --> 01:38:45,917
And the friendships... My lord.

833
01:38:48,223 --> 01:38:52,159
There are friendships formed
that are stronger than...

834
01:38:52,327 --> 01:38:54,192
Stronger than the fear of death.

835
01:38:58,867 --> 01:39:01,700
And they're never lonely.

836
01:39:02,137 --> 01:39:04,401
They're never lonely.

837
01:39:05,974 --> 01:39:08,670
And sometimes I envy them.

838
01:39:19,455 --> 01:39:22,185
Well, good night.

839
01:39:28,864 --> 01:39:35,360
Well, I guess Alison's death
has kind of hit him hard too.

840
01:39:38,974 --> 01:39:40,236
Well, do you want a card?

841
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:46,070
No.

842
01:39:48,283 --> 01:39:50,342
I wish Anacleto would come back.

843
01:39:51,253 --> 01:39:54,745
Well, I wish Alison would come back.

844
01:39:54,923 --> 01:39:57,756
I wish everything would be
the way it was before.

845
01:40:42,905 --> 01:40:44,702
Come on, you guys.

846
01:42:11,526 --> 01:42:13,289
Get out of here.

847
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:14,690
Out!

848
01:42:27,976 --> 01:42:29,637
Hey, what is this?

849
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:32,442
Hey, come on. What's wrong?

850
01:42:36,451 --> 01:42:37,918
Son of a...

851
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:57,197
Come on!

852
01:42:58,707 --> 01:43:00,197
What's the matter?

853
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:02,673
You started it. Come on.

854
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:06,003
Come on.

855
01:43:06,982 --> 01:43:08,677
Bastard.

856
01:43:11,586 --> 01:43:13,144
Where's my towel?
