1
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,012
No.

2
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:41,294
No means no.

3
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,605
Bonjour.

4
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,208
Carl, I know it's you.

5
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,072
Oh. Hey, man.

6
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:58,747
I was just about to call you.
That's so weird.

7
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,213
Had your number dialed,
was about to press "send."

8
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:02,578
Did you block your number?

9
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:06,085
Yeah, I did. You never answer
when I don't.

10
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:08,813
So, what are you doing?

11
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:11,256
Oh, just hanging out in my apartment.

12
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:13,895
- You did get my text, right?
- What? Text? What?

13
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,496
We're all going out tonight.

14
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,259
Man, that sounds great.
I wish I could join you.

15
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,458
I'm just so jammed up.

16
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,501
I'm totally off the grid,
you know?

17
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:22,933
No, I don't at all.

18
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:26,269
I got a bunch of stuff going on.
There's this thing I gotta do.

19
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:29,172
Any other night would've been great.
Darn it to heck.

20
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,573
Thing? What thing?

21
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:32,237
Thing, you know, just a thing.

22
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:35,350
If I had my thing in front of me,
I could tell you what it is...

23
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:37,748
...but I know there's a thing.
- A thing.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,014
I don't think there's anything
written down in your fake calendar.

25
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,782
No, it says specific things.

26
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,053
Specific things.
Like "get in line at the video store"?

27
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,356
What? What are you talking about?

28
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:51,022
I'm not at the video store.
I'm in my apartment.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,636
I can see you, Carl.
I'm outside the video store.

30
00:01:56,806 --> 00:01:58,603
- That's not me.
- It's not?

31
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:02,472
Oh, I know what's happening.
There is this guy who looks just like me...

32
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:04,704
...who goes to a lot of
the same stores I do.

33
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,473
That's probably who you're seeing.

34
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:07,673
Wow, that's amazing...

35
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,785
...because his mouth is moving
in sync with what you're saying.

36
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:14,479
Carl, I know you're not saying anything.

37
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,923
Carl, get outside.
I know you're not talking.

38
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:20,756
- What? All right.
- Carl.

39
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,659
- Look who's here.
- Hey. You.

40
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,294
Hi.

41
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,667
- I don't believe it.
- Rooney.

42
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,277
Carl Allen.
Never thought I'd see the day, my man.

43
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,243
- Hey.
- Thought you hung up the spurs, cowboy.

44
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:40,348
No, I just got a lot of stuff going on...

45
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:44,111
...some things I gotta do, issues pending,
keep me pretty busy.

46
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:45,845
Yeah? Oh, I hear you, player.

47
00:02:46,022 --> 00:02:48,490
So we are really excited
for you to be here, Carl...

48
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:51,092
...because we have an announcement
to make.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,160
Honey, show him.

50
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,892
There it is. Deal with it.

51
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,362
We're engaged.

52
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,933
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- Right?

53
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:03,664
- Big step, huh?
- Yeah, it's a big step. It's a huge one.

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,705
Man. Moving fast. That's okay.

55
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,240
What has it been, six months?

56
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,241
- No.
- Two years.

57
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,880
Oh, yeah. That's about right, then.

58
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:16,651
So anyway, we're gonna have
an engagement party on the 21 st. Open bar.

59
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,878
Oh, you bastard.
Always knows how to get me.

60
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,080
Nice. Carl, does that work for you?

61
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,493
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- What's there to figure out?

62
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:26,254
Oh, God, look who's here.

63
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:29,023
I'm not falling for that, Carl.
What's to figure out?

64
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:32,258
- Open bar. What's the problem?
- I'm serious. Stephanie's at the bar.

65
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:35,495
- The Stephanie?
- Yes, my ex-wife. She's at the bar.

66
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh, God, that is Stephanie.

67
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:43,576
- Looks like she's with someone there too.
- They seem to be thriving. Good for her.

68
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,444
They're touching each other's genitals.
Isn't that amazing?

69
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:51,712
I'm so glad I came out. Love it.
Okay, you know what? I gotta go.

70
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:54,186
- No. No. Carl, you're gonna stay.
- What?

71
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:56,552
It's been years.
You leave every time she comes.

72
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:59,354
Totally unrelated. It has nothing
to do with Stephanie.

73
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:01,554
Carl. Peter.

74
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,096
- Rooney.
- Stephanie, guys.

75
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,528
Hey.

76
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,793
- My boyfriend, Ted.
- Hey.

77
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,961
- I don't believe we...
- No, I don't believe we have.

78
00:04:10,506 --> 00:04:12,736
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

79
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,434
Terrible timing too,
because you just got here.

80
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,203
You just got here, too, Carl.

81
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:20,941
Yeah, but he's got a thing.

82
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:24,143
Yeah, that's a thing. There's a thing,
and there's no time.

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,221
There's a time crunch,
and time is of the essence.

84
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,053
Anyway, I am gone-orrhea.

85
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,996
Wow. That didn't sound quite right.
Oh, well.

86
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:37,723
Whoa!

87
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:48,405
See you, guys.

88
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:11,127
- Oh! Hi, Tillie.
- Morning, Carl.

89
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,632
Would you like to come over
for a little breakfast?

90
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,930
Gee, that sounds great, but I can't.

91
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:19,006
- Some cereal, a little yogurt?
- Yeah, no.

92
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,767
How about some toast, huh?

93
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:24,208
You know, I have to go to work,
but thanks.

94
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,644
Good show tonight.
Come check us out.

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,241
Your loss. Hey, man,
wanna rock out tonight?

96
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:31,978
- Oh, it's you. Let me guess, no?
- Yep.

97
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:35,487
- Yes?
- No, I meant yes to your no.

98
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:37,622
Yeah, bye.

99
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:42,757
Persianwifefinder.com.
No, thank you.

100
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,996
Costume party. Yeah, no.

101
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:49,962
Oh, boy.

102
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,036
Here we go.

103
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,146
- Carl Allen has reported for duty.
- I'm not a soldier, Norman.

104
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:01,415
You're a soldier on the front line
of finance.

105
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:04,309
Norman. Line one.

106
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:07,856
Did you wanna get that?
In the privacy of your office?

107
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:11,084
- I'll just get it here.
- Yeah, or that.

108
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:13,217
You're with Norman.

109
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:19,057
Uh-huh. Are you sure? Because...
Okay. Yep. Whatever you say.

110
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:20,566
Okay.

111
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,931
Remember that promotion
we were talking about?

112
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,506
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

113
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:28,769
Tried to fight for you on the phone there.

114
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:31,470
It was between you and Demko,
and they went with Demko.

115
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,548
I don't care.
I didn't really want the job badly.

116
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:38,118
I just figured after five years,
I'd be the logical choice, but whatever.

117
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,381
Look at it this way:
At least you didn't get shit-canned.

118
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,355
- Do you know what that means?
- Fired?

119
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,125
How did you know what that meant?
Have you heard me say that before?

120
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,197
No, it's a pretty common expression.

121
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:55,099
- In my circles. I made it up.
- Well, it's catching on.

122
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:58,331
This'll cheer you up.
I'm having a little get-together at my place.

123
00:06:58,507 --> 00:07:02,443
- It's a funny hat and-or wig party.
- Oh, man.

124
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:05,036
Sucks I'm gonna be out of town.

125
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,605
- You don't know what day it is.
- When is it?

126
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:08,943
- Friday.
- I'm out of town.

127
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:11,486
You spoke at the same time
I did just then.

128
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:14,282
Like you were committed
to saying what you were saying...

129
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:17,517
...regardless of what I was gonna say.
- Hm.

130
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,728
I admit, business has been slow.

131
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:23,831
There's a lot less demand
for a small Rollerblade shop...

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,059
...what with Big 5
and Sport Chalet...

133
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:29,669
...but my designs are gonna
revolutionize the roller industry.

134
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,741
I know that, Marv,
but you have no equity.

135
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,069
- None.
- And your credit...

136
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:37,769
Bad, but I don't wanna
sound desperate.

137
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,973
- Yeah.
- I have no other options left.

138
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,657
Carl. Hey. Long time no see.

139
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,663
Nick Lane? Hey.

140
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,802
- You don't still work at the bank, do you?
- Yeah.

141
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,100
Kind of why I'm sitting outside here,
eating my lunch, wearing the nametag.

142
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:07,299
You must be running this place by now.

143
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:10,968
I could have. Had a couple offers.
Didn't wanna get tied down.

144
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,546
- How's Stephanie?
- Good.

145
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,376
God.

146
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,509
She's good. What have you been doing?

147
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:20,849
I've been all over the map, man.
I've lived.

148
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:24,550
I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
I ate bat in Laos.

149
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:26,285
I shot a cow with a bazooka.

150
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,454
I'm not proud of that last one,
but I did it, man.

151
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,863
- Sounds wild.
- Wanna know my secret?

152
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:34,995
I'm a yes man.

153
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:38,137
The word "yes"
has changed my life. Here.

154
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,036
No, thanks. I'm fine.

155
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,972
"Fine?" I wipe my ass with "fine."

156
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,805
Wow. Okay.

157
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,473
- You don't wanna work here, Carl.
- Yeah, I do.

158
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,479
No, you don't.

159
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,344
Why don't you take this rock...

160
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:56,650
...throw it at that bank
and shatter the window?

161
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:59,818
- No, thanks.
- Then ask me if I want to.

162
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:02,589
- Do you wanna throw that rock at the bank?
- Yes.

163
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:05,730
Oh, my God.

164
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:08,096
- What are you, nuts?
- Go to the seminar, Carl.

165
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:09,595
Stay right there.

166
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,603
- He's gonna break.
- Stop.

167
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:20,108
Carl, live your life!
You won't regret it.

168
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,149
- Whoo!
- Hey, stop. Stop!

169
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,460
- I know you wanna see my band.
- No.

170
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,089
Sorry.

171
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,763
- Hello?
- Stephanie?

172
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,268
- Carl.
- Yeah, it's me.

173
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:47,569
Just felt like calling you.
I was missing you, I guess. Weird, huh?

174
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes, Carl. I have to go.

175
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:52,875
- Ted and I are taking a little boat ride.
- Oh, that's great.

176
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:55,073
Good for you. Good for you.

177
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,987
Jesus, Pete. I'm not in or I'm busy.

178
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:20,101
Oh, come on. You're halfway through,
just snap it off already.

179
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,786
- Pete? Hey. Where you been?
- You not been getting my calls?

180
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:36,323
What? God, no.
Oh, I totally lost my phone.

181
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:37,857
You're so full of shit.

182
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:42,662
- Here it is.
- Yeah. There it is.

183
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,629
You know what, buddy?
You missed my engagement party tonight.

184
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:49,368
Oh, no. Oh, shoot, you're kidding.
That was tonight?

185
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:52,769
- Mm-hm.
- I'm so sorry, man. I totally gapped it.

186
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,502
Listen, I'll make it up to you.
I promise. I swear.

187
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:58,545
You pick the day. Any day you want,
we'll go out, swashbuckle.

188
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:01,080
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

189
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,277
This wasn't drinks at a bar, Carl.
This was my engagement party.

190
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:08,446
- You only get married once.
- I certainly wouldn't do it again.

191
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,024
I know, Carl.
I know that Stephanie left you.

192
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:15,357
And I know that you have issues because
of it, but this isn't about you. It's about me.

193
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:19,058
When's the last time you did anything fun?
You always make excuses.

194
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,669
"I don't wanna commit.
I don't wanna be tied down."

195
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:24,032
I mean, do you even know
my fiancee's last name?

196
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:27,175
Yeah. Fisher. Fishman.

197
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:31,575
- Wait. Fishwall?
- Fishwall?

198
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:34,978
- You think her name's Lucy Fishwall?
- No? That's wrong?

199
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,640
- It's Burns.
- Burns?

200
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,181
It's Lucy Burns, Carl.

201
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,051
And guess what?
She doesn't like my best friend.

202
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:45,719
I keep trying to think of reasons
why she should, but you know what?

203
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:47,759
- I can't think of any.
- Pete, l...

204
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,024
I don't wanna hear another excuse, Carl.
You do whatever you want.

205
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,533
I'm telling you, you don't change your life,
you're gonna end up Ionely.

206
00:11:54,703 --> 00:12:00,073
A Ionely guy, Carl. Lonely guy.

207
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,608
Hey, Carl.

208
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,387
Hey, Rooney, come here for a second.

209
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:19,727
Carl look a little odd to you? Is it me,
or does it look like he's kind of dead?

210
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,458
Nope. No more than usual.

211
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:27,432
I don't know. I'm kind of leaning towards
thinking he might actually be dead.

212
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:33,141
I guess I never saw him a lot,
so it's hard for me to tell the difference.

213
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:35,071
Yeah, that's true.

214
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,405
He never did much.

215
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:38,910
- Wasn't a good friend.
- Nope.

216
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:41,548
Wasn't a good anything.

217
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:45,710
- Are there more beers in the fridge?
- Sorry, last one.

218
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,719
Now, that's upsetting.

219
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,529
What was that?

220
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:42,508
Welcome to yes.
We are about to begin.

221
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,372
Please, find a seat.

222
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:48,874
Carl? Hey, Carl! Psst!

223
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:50,575
Carl, man, hey.

224
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:52,846
- Carl.
- Hey, Nick.

225
00:13:53,355 --> 00:13:55,220
- You made it, man.
- Did you wanna...

226
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:57,552
Sure, let me sit down.
I knew you'd come.

227
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:01,560
I saw it in your eyes, man.
You're gonna love this. Terrence is a genius.

228
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,757
He's gonna blow your mind all over
the room. He's like a mind grenade.

229
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:08,402
- I'm not sure I want that.
- Yeah, but you need it.

230
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,764
That's why you're here.

231
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:13,806
You have got to start saying yes, my man,
and I mean to everything.

232
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,804
It's starting.

233
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,336
Life.

234
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,241
We are all living it. Or are we?

235
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:23,783
Ooh, heavy.

236
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:30,357
Change is generated from consciousness,
but where is consciousness generated from?

237
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,653
From the external.

238
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:36,889
And how do we control the external?
With one word.

239
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,997
And what is that word?

240
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,561
- Yes!
- Jeez.

241
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,732
Yes.

242
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,399
Yes.

243
00:14:49,244 --> 00:14:52,111
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes. Yes!

244
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:59,714
- Yes!
- Whoo!

245
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,220
The word is "yes."

246
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:06,258
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,690
- Say it a million times.
- Yes.

248
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,558
Say it a million more times.

249
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:14,031
And the word you will have said
2 million times is:

250
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:16,330
Yes!

251
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:24,370
Yes.

252
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:29,549
I want you to invite yes into your lives...

253
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:34,553
...because it will RSVP "yes."

254
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:40,619
When you say yes to things,
you embrace the possible.

255
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:47,224
You gobble up all of life's energies,
and you excrete the waste.

256
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:54,175
Before we begin today,
I'd like to welcome our new members.

257
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:01,515
- Who among you is new?
- He is. This guy right here. He's new.

258
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:03,810
- Over here.
- Please don't. Jesus.

259
00:16:03,986 --> 00:16:10,255
- Come on up, future yes man.
- That's okay, I'm just auditing.

260
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:17,824
You can't audit life, my friend.
Now get on up here.

261
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:23,632
- No, thanks. I'm cool.
- I'm sorry? What was that you said?

262
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:29,473
- I said, I'm cool.
- Before that.

263
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,040
Thank you.

264
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:35,274
Back up just a little bit more.

265
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,214
- No.
- No man. No man.

266
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:40,446
No man. No man. No man.

267
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:41,816
No man. No man.

268
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,389
Okay.

269
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:48,062
If the molehill won't come to Terrence...

270
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:52,455
...Terrence will come to the molehill.

271
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,667
What's your name?

272
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:04,911
Carl.

273
00:17:05,347 --> 00:17:06,712
Let me guess, Carl.

274
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:09,544
Someone talked you
into coming here today, didn't they?

275
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:13,143
- Yes.
- Yes!

276
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:17,053
And you're not sure about this, are you?

277
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:18,683
No.

278
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,921
No man. No man.
No man. No man.

279
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,725
You're dead, Carl.

280
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,833
You say no to life,
and therefore you're not living.

281
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,001
You make up excuses
to the people around you...

282
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:33,539
...and to yourself.

283
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,603
You're stuck in the same dead-end job.
You have been for years.

284
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:42,011
You don't have a girlfriend. You don't
have anything close to a girlfriend.

285
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,049
And you lost the love of your life...

286
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:47,211
...because she couldn't be with someone
who didn't live theirs.

287
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,025
And on most nights you're so bored
and filled with ennui...

288
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:59,361
...you can't even summon the enthusiasm
necessary to masturbate.

289
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,495
Am I right, Carl?

290
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:10,369
I have had some trouble.

291
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:20,410
- We're gonna make a covenant, Carl.
- Yes.

292
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:24,047
- Do you want to make a covenant?
- Ugh...

293
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:27,018
The word is "yes," Carl.

294
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:28,423
- Yes!
- Yes.

295
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:29,621
- Yes!
- Yes.

296
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,288
Yes!

297
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,327
Once you leave this building...

298
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:38,495
...every time an opportunity
presents itself...

299
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,471
...no matter what it is...

300
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,702
...you will say yes.

301
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:44,971
- Yes.
- Yes!

302
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,444
- Yes.
- Yes!

303
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:48,708
- Yes.
- Yes.

304
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:51,915
What if I...

305
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:54,816
say

306
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,781
...the other word?

307
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:00,527
You'll be making a promise to yourself.

308
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:04,723
And when you break a promise
to yourself...

309
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,199
...things can get a little dicey.

310
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,930
What do you say, Carl?

311
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:14,570
Are you ready to make a covenant?

312
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,504
- Come on, Carl.
- Yes.

313
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:17,975
- Yes.
- Yes.

314
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:20,273
- Yes.
- Again.

315
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:21,882
- Yes.
- Yes.

316
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,881
- Say it again.
- Yes!

317
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:29,655
- Make me believe it.
- Yes, yes, yes.

318
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:34,520
Yes!

319
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,249
Hey, there he is.

320
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,189
- That was really wonderful.
- Thank you.

321
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,726
Pretty powerful stuff, huh?

322
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:10,194
- Hey. Good to have you with us.
- Yes.

323
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:13,823
- So are you gonna do it?
- I don't know. Maybe.

324
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:18,200
That's weird. I didn't realize
we just stepped out of a "maybe" seminar.

325
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,572
Hey, man. That's a nice car.

326
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:27,109
Could you drive me to Elysian Park?

327
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:29,846
Oh. Ugh...

328
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:31,383
Yes!

329
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:35,815
Sure he can. Right, Carl?

330
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,393
Yeah, why not?

331
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:44,925
Yes. You won't regret this, Carl.

332
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:54,968
- Can I use your phone?
- Go, man, go.

333
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,468
Keep going or this'll do,
because it doesn't really matter?

334
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,837
Yeah, hold on a sec,
I can't hear myself think.

335
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,606
It's just a little further, man.
Just right up the hill there.

336
00:21:33,782 --> 00:21:35,511
Go ahead.

337
00:21:36,852 --> 00:21:38,342
And what did you say?

338
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:44,919
Oh, I'm just right
over here. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:46,755
What? Hello? Hello?

340
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:50,631
Oh, shit, man. Your battery's dead.

341
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,460
Oh, great.

342
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:57,661
- Thanks.
- Well, gracias, amigo.

343
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,297
I mean, it's real nice of you
to give me a ride. Most people just say no.

344
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:05,142
Course, I have been having a lot of luck
lately outside of that hotel.

345
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,980
No problem. Have a good night.

346
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,784
Can I borrow a couple bucks?

347
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:14,178
Okay.

348
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,382
I've come this far.

349
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:20,988
Yes, you can.

350
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:23,892
You got a whole lot there.
Can I have it all?

351
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:33,039
Sure. It's all yours.

352
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:38,411
God bless you, man.

353
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,268
Oh, come on.

354
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,235
Come on, come on.

355
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:09,905
Perfect.

356
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,446
Hey, Carl. Do you wanna give
all your money away to a homeless guy?

357
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,106
Yes, yes, I do.

358
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:17,808
Letting him
burn out your phone...

359
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:20,250
...so you can't call AAA
when you run out of gas?

360
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,913
That sounds like a fucking great idea!

361
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,922
Why don't you take a stroll
through the hills...

362
00:23:26,094 --> 00:23:29,461
...and get killed by the Manson family?
Don't mind if I do.

363
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:48,612
Come on, man.

364
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,577
Yes. Since that's my only fucking option.

365
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:14,565
Would you like to carry a 20-pound
container of gas up a giant hill to your car?

366
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:17,837
Oh, could I? Could I really?

367
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:20,737
That's a good look.

368
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,177
- Hi. Did you just take my picture?
- Maybe.

369
00:24:27,322 --> 00:24:29,483
Did you just run out of gas?

370
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,255
Maybe.

371
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:36,920
That sucks.
That happened to me last week.

372
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:38,929
When you were driving
out of your way...

373
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,866
...to drop off a homeless guy who wore out
your battery so you couldn't call AAA?

374
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,836
No. I take it
that's what happened to you.

375
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:48,407
No. Why would you assume that?

376
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,608
He used up your phone?

377
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,716
Yeah. Apparently he was the most popular
homeless man on the planet.

378
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:58,478
He was staying connected.
It was good to see.

379
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,645
I'm just glad that I could
be a part of it, really.

380
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,451
- That must feel good.
- Oh, truly, truly.

381
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:07,117
Yeah. And I'm getting some exercise,
which is cool.

382
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:09,491
Well, do you need a ride?

383
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:12,123
On that thing?

384
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:25,005
Am I going too fast for you?

385
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,047
No. In fact, I think you should go faster.

386
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,980
That way if we crash, at least I'll die.

387
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:33,882
I just don't wanna
be kept alive artificially.

388
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:48,065
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a picture. Smile.

389
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,000
- I can't see. I'm blind.
- Me too. Isn't it great? Whoo!

390
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:10,482
Yeah, that's getting it good. Yep.

391
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:14,959
- Well, thanks again for the ride.
- No problem.

392
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,361
Hopefully the color will return
to your face sometime soon.

393
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,525
- I'm more of a four-wheel kind of guy.
- Really?

394
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:25,195
I never would've guessed that.
You seemed so at ease on two.

395
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:30,942
- Can I have my helmet back now?
- I'm still wearing it, aren't I?

396
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,272
Yeah.

397
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:35,612
Thanks.

398
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:37,911
So you okay?

399
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:41,283
Yeah, I'm good, unless you wanna
stick around and make out.

400
00:26:41,456 --> 00:26:43,981
- What?
- What did you say?

401
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:49,220
Hey, l...

402
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:56,561
Have a good night.

403
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:23,763
Yes.

404
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:34,641
"Yes always leads
to something good.

405
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,875
Never avoid opportunities.

406
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:43,142
They may come in any form."

407
00:27:47,655 --> 00:27:50,886
- Hello?
- Carl, it's your buddy Norman.

408
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,994
Well, and your boss, but more your buddy
than your boss, right?

409
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:55,891
I guess.

410
00:27:57,165 --> 00:28:00,032
So look, we're kind of short
on Saturday staff.

411
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:01,862
Is there any way you could come in?

412
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,098
Sure.

413
00:28:04,272 --> 00:28:07,730
Nothing I like better than the inside
of a bank on a beautiful Saturday.

414
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:12,141
Yeah. Yeah, there really is something
magical about this place.

415
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:20,243
Would I like to increase the size
of my penis?

416
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:22,481
Right.

417
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:24,718
Like I need that.

418
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:33,966
- Persian wifefinder.
- Hi there. I am Faranoush.

419
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:36,626
Would you be the man for me?

420
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,834
I guess so.

421
00:28:39,907 --> 00:28:43,206
Excuse me. I'd like to apply
for a small-business loan.

422
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:44,675
And what's your business?

423
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:48,077
I bake cakes in the shape
of different celebrities' faces.

424
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:52,442
- Oh, wow, Mickey Rourke.
- No. It's Bono.

425
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:55,512
Oh. Yeah, right.

426
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,056
Let's hope it doesn't taste
like Mickey Rourke.

427
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:00,758
So, what do you think?

428
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:05,656
I think yes.

429
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:12,463
Inta-maresting.

430
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:14,407
Cakes, huh?

431
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:18,671
Yeah. I just kind of went with my gut
on it, Norm.

432
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:21,511
- You called me Norm.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:25,210
- Could that, like, be my nickname?
- Yeah. I guess.

434
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:30,221
Oh, nice. I like your style.
Car. That could be yours.

435
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,290
Yeah. Carl's pretty short already, but...

436
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,655
But it's the kind of dazzle
we need around here.

437
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:36,694
- Yeah.
- And you know what I did?

438
00:29:36,864 --> 00:29:37,888
What?

439
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:42,628
That Demko thing really chapped my ass.
I marched upstairs and I told the big guns:

440
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:46,399
"Carl gets promoted in lieu of Demko,
or along with Demko...

441
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:49,008
...whichever, or I walk."

442
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:51,441
Really? What did they say?

443
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:55,343
Well, they were quite attracted to the me
walking option, you know, for a moment.

444
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:57,848
- But then I threw that off the table.
- Good move.

445
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:01,477
And they said if you started to show
some initiative, I could promote you.

446
00:30:02,256 --> 00:30:03,280
And?

447
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,822
- Well, you're doing it.
- Yeah?

448
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:06,755
- Yeah, the whole cake thing.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:06,928 --> 00:30:08,657
- You're making up nicknames.
- Okay.

450
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,695
Know what?
I called Demko this morning...

451
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,163
...to ask if he could work,
and know what he said?

452
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,529
- No.
- How did you know that?

453
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:16,727
He's not here.

454
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:19,270
- Yeah, but you are, Car.
- Yeah.

455
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,432
And that's why I'm gonna
give the job to you.

456
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,109
Norm, that's amazing.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

457
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,307
Nice little raise in it for you too.
Bump up your salary to 65.

458
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:33,318
- Thousand?
- Of course, thousand.

459
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:36,355
Come on, let's step this thing
up a notch, Broseph.

460
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,283
See what I did there?

461
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,762
I joined "bro" with "Joseph." Broseph.
Pretty cool, huh?

462
00:30:45,266 --> 00:30:46,756
Very cool, Norm.

463
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:53,830
I have been such a dick and a douche.

464
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:56,641
More of a douche
than a dick, probably...

465
00:30:56,811 --> 00:30:59,609
...but I'm sorry. I should have been there.
I mean, really.

466
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:04,443
- You're preaching to the choir, Carl.
- I'm telling you, man, things are different.

467
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:07,144
Okay. Wait, so wait.
You have to say yes to everything?

468
00:31:07,321 --> 00:31:11,087
Yeah, exactly. It's like you said:
I wasn't open to stuff, and now I am...

469
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:15,286
...and things are changing for me.
It's like the era of yes has begun.

470
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:18,432
All right. Look, gets you out of the house,
I'm all for it.

471
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,863
Excuse me.
Could we get another round of drinks?

472
00:31:21,035 --> 00:31:22,900
And actually, we're gonna start a tab...

473
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,039
...and our good friend here, Carl,
will be taking care of it.

474
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:32,338
- Well, you're okay with that, right, buddy?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

475
00:31:32,513 --> 00:31:33,878
Okay.

476
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,219
I should be prepping my case for Monday,
but I cannot miss this.

477
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,587
Hey, you, another bump of hot sauce.

478
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:51,088
Boy, you guys are really
into this yes thing.

479
00:31:55,636 --> 00:31:57,035
Argh!

480
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:01,207
Okay, okay.

481
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,622
He did it.

482
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:33,938
Drinks on me.

483
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:36,003
Crazy, man.

484
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:38,776
Carl, that was so awesome.

485
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:41,414
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Could l...

486
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:43,413
Absolutely.

487
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:47,782
I don't think that's what she was
asking for, but all right.

488
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:52,726
Was I chewing gum before?

489
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:55,419
Hey. What do you
think you're doing, asshole?

490
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:58,258
Easy, easy.
It was a little misunderstanding, okay?

491
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:03,631
I'm just saying yes to life, homes.
You gotta say yes to life.

492
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,967
I made a sacred "conevant."

493
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,102
That sounded naughty.

494
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:12,542
- I think you and I need to step outside.
- No. God, no.

495
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:16,046
Okay, it's okay. I got this. I got this.

496
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,044
Okay. But if I win...

497
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,088
...I get to take that pretty girl of yours
to a ball...

498
00:33:23,257 --> 00:33:25,589
...because she deserves that.

499
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,218
Every pretty girl deserves to go to a ball.

500
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,955
That is so nice.

501
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:36,861
Oh, shit.

502
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:43,604
All right. He punched me
right in the face, man.

503
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:46,406
- Don't worry. I got your back.
- You don't have anybody's.

504
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:48,276
I'm sorry, man. It's all our fault.

505
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,179
- I haven't fighted in a fight since grade 7.
- I know.

506
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:53,286
Hey. Are we gonna fight or what?

507
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:57,015
Yeah, we're gonna fight.
We're gonna fight, all right. Okay?

508
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:59,455
You want some, huh, more?

509
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:02,994
Because I am open for business, okay?
Oh, where'd I go?

510
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,223
Oh, where'd I go?

511
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,492
Yeah, how do you fight
what you can't see?

512
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:12,102
Did you see The Legend of Billy Jack?

513
00:34:12,506 --> 00:34:14,906
Because I'm gonna take this foot...

514
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:18,842
...and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face...

515
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,607
...and there's not a goddamn thing
you can do about it.

516
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:25,917
Just don't break my teeth
off on the curb, okay?

517
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:29,955
But let's really sell this.
Give them a show.

518
00:34:30,124 --> 00:34:31,148
What?

519
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:36,126
First, we have
to establish the ground rules.

520
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:39,664
And the ground rules are
there are no ground rules.

521
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:46,938
Idiot. I'm the wrong guy.

522
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,869
Well, maybe you need to start
being the right guy.

523
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,568
That's why you got punched out...

524
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:55,307
...because you got the wrong attitude
right out of the gate.

525
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:56,882
I'm over here, dickhole.

526
00:34:57,418 --> 00:35:01,013
Oh, my God. That's so funny.

527
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,313
You're a complete...

528
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:05,616
You all right?

529
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,886
I almost blocked it.
Didn't get there in time.

530
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,791
Okay, we're done.
We've been drinking.

531
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:11,955
- He's really been drinking.
- Seriously, man.

532
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,998
I'm glad we had this experience.

533
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:19,568
- I think we both grew from it. Call me.
- You asshole.

534
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:26,410
- We really did.
- Yeah. We did, bud.

535
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:32,051
She's never gonna go to a ball.

536
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,017
No. No, she's not.

537
00:36:06,687 --> 00:36:10,748
- Okay. Tillie, there you are.
- Hi, Carl.

538
00:36:10,925 --> 00:36:12,324
What can I do for you?

539
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,826
Well, I was wondering if you could help me
put up some shelves.

540
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,423
Oh, really?

541
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:30,770
Okay. That should just about do it.

542
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:34,346
- I'll see you later, Tillie.
- That was wonderful, Carl.

543
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:38,080
Oh, not so fast.

544
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,085
What are you doing?

545
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:44,891
- Oh, darn, I forgot to go to the bank.
- Oh, that's okay.

546
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,619
I'm getting so forgetful.

547
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:50,855
- It happens with age.
- Don't worry about it.

548
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,829
I am gonna have to repay you somehow.

549
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:58,097
Oh, just doing a favor for a neighbor
is good enough for me.

550
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,831
You are so handsome.

551
00:37:02,843 --> 00:37:06,540
How come I never see you
with a girl over there?

552
00:37:06,714 --> 00:37:12,380
Well, I'm just... I'm not in a serious thing,
but I am dating.

553
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:15,215
- Would you like a release?
- I'm sorry?

554
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:18,222
You know, a sexual release?

555
00:37:18,425 --> 00:37:19,756
Uh...

556
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:24,994
- What do I do here?
- Oh, you don't have to do anything, Carl.

557
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,829
You just lay back
and I will take care of everything.

558
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:32,370
I don't know what to say here.
I'm stumped. I'm baffled.

559
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,600
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to say yes to this one, Till.

560
00:37:35,776 --> 00:37:39,041
- Oh, come on.
- But thanks for the offer and the image.

561
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:44,173
And I've got this thing I gotta do,
so I'll be seeing you.

562
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:48,479
In my nightmares.

563
00:37:49,857 --> 00:37:52,121
Oh, come on, give me a break.

564
00:37:53,127 --> 00:37:56,324
Terrence said this would happen if I said no.
That's ridiculous.

565
00:37:56,497 --> 00:38:01,230
Get out of there.
If I wanna say no, I'll say no!

566
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:16,340
Nice dog.

567
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,397
Just relax. I'll handle this.

568
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,663
Oh, God!

569
00:38:40,774 --> 00:38:44,437
Oh, God! Oh, no. Oh, my...

570
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:46,338
Wow.

571
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,877
That... Oh...

572
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,884
That is a...

573
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:53,849
How are you doing that? Ay!

574
00:39:00,561 --> 00:39:04,088
"Costume party. Come as your favorite
Harry Potter character."

575
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:05,289
You got it, Norm.

576
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:54,338
Hi.

577
00:39:56,517 --> 00:40:00,009
Really? I've always wanted
to try it. Yeah.

578
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:03,054
So I can expect delivery anytime
between 8 a.m. and 5:30?

579
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,359
Hello. Wondering if you had a moment...

580
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:09,394
...to discuss the Church of Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, come on in.

581
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:13,761
- Buttercup Girls.
- Buttercup Girls.

582
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:17,267
Yeah. All right.

583
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,904
Hey. It's really working. Ah!

584
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:31,885
It's beautiful, man. It's beautiful.

585
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:35,613
I do wanna take guitar lessons.
I do wanna learn how to fly.

586
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,450
Yes, I would like to learn Korean.

587
00:40:37,624 --> 00:40:44,621
I would understand

588
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,290
All right, now I got it.

589
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:53,534
Whoa.

590
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,282
What did he call me?

591
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:15,919
Homeless.

592
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:18,928
Come and get it.

593
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:21,101
There you are. You want some?

594
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,632
He never listens.

595
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:24,995
Yeah.

596
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:29,106
I wanna start an
organic-fertilizer distribution business.

597
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:34,305
Next.

598
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:38,950
- Wanna see a... Oh, sorry.
- You know what? I'd love to.

599
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,814
Way to stick in there.

600
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,471
There you go.

601
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,074
Hey. I came.

602
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:06,340
Great.

603
00:42:07,714 --> 00:42:08,976
Yeah.

604
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:12,479
Rolling Rock, please.

605
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:18,222
- From the dawn of time...
- In the netherworld.

606
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,688
There was a band.

607
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:23,887
Oh, yes, there was.

608
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:25,930
And we were that band.

609
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,897
Yes, we were.

610
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:29,831
And that band made rock 'n' roll.

611
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:31,561
Oh, yes, they did.

612
00:42:32,372 --> 00:42:36,832
And that band ate arame
and other sea vegetables.

613
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,443
Yeah.

614
00:42:38,612 --> 00:42:41,672
And that band was rad.

615
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:49,712
Hello, Jake, Penelope,
Rodrigo, Phillip, Zachary.

616
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:52,790
- We are Munchausen by Proxy.
- You're kidding me.

617
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,087
I should have been the one
To break up with you

618
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,196
You said, "Who are you?"

619
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:59,195
Who are you?

620
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:04,770
I wanna snap your neck and spit on you
You said, "Who are you?"

621
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:06,803
Who are you?

622
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:12,237
If I got a call that said you were dead
You said, "Who are you?"

623
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:14,437
Who are you?

624
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:19,382
I'd shrug my shoulders, and I'd say whatevs
You said, "Who are you?"

625
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:22,044
Who are you?

626
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:26,659
Hey, did you ever meet my friend lan?
He's a computer hacker.

627
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:30,285
He helped me erase your MySpace page.

628
00:43:30,464 --> 00:43:34,833
And your band's MySpace page.
And your Facebook page.

629
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:36,902
Happy networking, asshole.

630
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:57,749
Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again

631
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:59,790
Happened once, it happened twice

632
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,623
It happened three times,
Maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe

633
00:44:03,797 --> 00:44:06,732
Maybe it happened six times
But it won't happen a seventh time

634
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,800
No, no, no, no

635
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:16,433
I'm not your late night booty call

636
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:20,803
Whore no more

637
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:25,884
Don't call me past 11 p.m.
It won't happen again

638
00:44:26,486 --> 00:44:28,215
You can call me at 10:59

639
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:32,916
But don't call me at 11
'Cause that's my rule now

640
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:45,794
Can I get a water?

641
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:53,640
Hey. Out-of-gas make-out guy.

642
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:57,215
Did we make out? Oh, right, we did.
Now I remember.

643
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:00,148
- What are you doing here?
- I know. Is this crazy or what?

644
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,288
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah.

645
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:05,016
- Are you stalking me?
- No. I would never do that.

646
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:08,161
By the way, your new living-room
furniture looks great from the yard.

647
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:14,193
- Hey, great gig or whatever, you know.
- Thanks.

648
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:17,735
Yeah. Strong lyrics.
You just make that stuff up?

649
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:20,737
- It comes from personal experience.
- Cool.

650
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,204
You want a drink?

651
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,572
Oh, I can't. I have to wake up early.

652
00:45:25,746 --> 00:45:28,909
- So I have to go, but...
- Oh, really?

653
00:45:31,184 --> 00:45:33,744
But you can walk me to my scooter.

654
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:37,555
I teach a jogging photo group...

655
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:42,127
...for people who want to both exercise
and practice photography.

656
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:44,696
Oh, yeah,
that's getting very popular now.

657
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:48,858
It's in Griffith Park
and we do a loop. It's about five miles.

658
00:45:49,036 --> 00:45:51,334
It's at 6 a.m.

659
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:55,771
Wow. I haven't been up at 6 a.m.
In, like, never.

660
00:45:55,942 --> 00:46:00,072
- That's early.
- Yeah, but it makes for amazing pictures.

661
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,881
Okay, so you're in a band...

662
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,144
...you do the jogging photography,
what else?

663
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,446
Whatever I want.

664
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:11,989
I volunteer at a shelter. I paint a little bit.

665
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,593
Yeah, that's cool.
I've done some charity work.

666
00:46:14,761 --> 00:46:17,025
And some nude modeling, FYI.

667
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:21,392
Good to know, if, you know,
if I ever need to...

668
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:27,171
So anyway, my answer is yes.
I'd be happy to go out with you.

669
00:46:27,341 --> 00:46:29,434
I didn't ask you out.

670
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:31,804
Could have fooled me
with that modeling comment.

671
00:46:31,978 --> 00:46:33,377
You said that.

672
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:36,175
Well, whoever said it,
it made me very uncomfortable.

673
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:41,077
Hey, why don't you
come to my class tomorrow?

674
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:45,315
Why don't you stop smothering me?
Seriously. It's way too much too soon.

675
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:46,686
Yeah, I'd love to.

676
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:52,163
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow...

677
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:55,597
- Carl.
- Allison.

678
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:13,443
Yeah, Rooney?

679
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,349
Yo, Carl, hitting the clubs.

680
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:19,083
Got a case of Red Bull.
Gonna pull an all-nighter. You down?

681
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:20,817
Yeah.

682
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:30,836
Okay, guys, everybody ready?
Cameras loaded?

683
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:32,266
- Allison?
- Yeah?

684
00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:34,304
Do we need to use a flash?

685
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:36,305
Not when the sun's up, Reggie.

686
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:47,982
Beautiful night, guys.
You take it to the limit, and I respect that.

687
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:50,953
Hit me on the cell this week.
Let's do it again.

688
00:47:51,124 --> 00:47:55,185
Carl, if somebody asked me to
describe tonight, I would just go, "Ow!"

689
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:58,422
Back at you, Roon. Lee, I hardly know you,
but I feel comfortable.

690
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:02,534
Look how close I'm getting.
Hey, Allison, it's me, Carl. I'm here.

691
00:48:03,303 --> 00:48:05,328
Allison, I'm here.

692
00:48:07,007 --> 00:48:08,167
Allison.

693
00:48:09,543 --> 00:48:12,535
Hey. Who were those guys?

694
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:16,011
That's Rooney and my friend Lee.
He's a nurse. I was making fun of him.

695
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:19,084
We hit a couple raves last night.
It was totally off the hook.

696
00:48:19,252 --> 00:48:21,550
- You seem a little hyper.
- Had a couple Red Bulls.

697
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:25,452
Ever had Red Bull? I never had Red Bull.
Had Red Bull last night. I like Red Bull.

698
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,490
I got a new necklace. Glows in the dark.

699
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:30,027
Can't really see it right now,
unless you do this.

700
00:48:30,197 --> 00:48:33,633
That's really something. Doesn't Red Bull
make you crash pretty hard?

701
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,530
No, no, no. No, no. I don't think so. No.

702
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:39,695
No. Hey, after we jog,
we should get a Red Bull.

703
00:48:39,873 --> 00:48:42,273
You and I could get a Red Bull.
We could share.

704
00:48:42,442 --> 00:48:44,034
- Okay, that'd be fu...
- Red Bull.

705
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,337
- That sounds...
- Red Bull.

706
00:48:45,545 --> 00:48:46,739
- I think I'd...
- Red Bull.

707
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:49,211
- I'd really...
- Red Bull.

708
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,475
Red Bull.

709
00:48:52,052 --> 00:48:56,716
Okay. A lot of energy. I like it.
Everybody, this is Carl.

710
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,290
- Carl, this is everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

711
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:03,654
Come on. Let's get into shipshape.

712
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:12,229
Oh, it's a good one.

713
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:15,330
Hold that.

714
00:49:16,676 --> 00:49:17,802
Got it.

715
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:29,980
Hey, Carl, you okay?

716
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,717
Hold it right there.

717
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:51,533
That's good.

718
00:49:52,779 --> 00:49:57,773
I can't put my finger on you.
You're kind of unpredictable.

719
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:00,085
Kind of mysterious.

720
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:01,379
You know, listen.

721
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,991
I like to keep it fresh. I like to live it up.
I like to mix it up.

722
00:50:05,158 --> 00:50:07,490
If that doesn't jive with you,
we should end this.

723
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:09,526
I love that.

724
00:50:09,696 --> 00:50:12,893
I don't know how people go through life
with the same boring routine.

725
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:15,125
- Just shoot me.
- I know. Right in the face.

726
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:18,738
Seriously, I dated this guy and I was
astounded at how content he was...

727
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:21,567
...just living his life
in this closed-off little box.

728
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:25,404
I know. It's so frustrating. I just
wanna grab these people and shake them.

729
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:29,310
Say, "Wake up, you. You're missing out
on a little thing called life."

730
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:31,211
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

731
00:50:32,085 --> 00:50:35,145
So, what happened
to closed-off-little-box boy?

732
00:50:35,322 --> 00:50:38,587
It just didn't work out. It's a long story.

733
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:42,159
Yeah? Same story
you were singing about last night?

734
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,588
Might be.

735
00:50:45,498 --> 00:50:48,467
Closed-off-little-box boy, tender topic.
Probe no further.

736
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:51,900
Okay, if you must know,
we lived together.

737
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,064
I thought he was it, the one,
or whatever.

738
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:58,870
And then surprise, he ended it,
out of nowhere for no reason.

739
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:00,410
Gone, never saw him again.

740
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:04,978
Wow. That's rough. I'm sorry.

741
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:08,512
Next time you should warn me
about the length of the story, though.

742
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:09,780
Kind of dragged on.

743
00:51:09,956 --> 00:51:12,288
- I'll work on that.
- Yeah, just trim the fat.

744
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:16,992
Ooh! Jeez. That was very healthy.

745
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:30,709
She's spontaneous. She's ballsy.

746
00:51:30,877 --> 00:51:33,345
She has no clue what she's doing
and she doesn't care.

747
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:35,003
She's the complete opposite of me.

748
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:37,479
Carl, could you
please pass the Cholula?

749
00:51:37,651 --> 00:51:39,619
Sure, Faranoush.

750
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:41,986
How did you two meet again?

751
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:45,818
Persianwifefinder. Com. It's pretty cool.
You should check it out.

752
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:48,392
- I'm engaged.
- Oh, yeah.

753
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:50,961
Should you talk about Allison
in front of Faranoush?

754
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:53,998
It's okay, man. We just met.
She knows it's not exclusive.

755
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:58,001
- Besides, she's totally not my type.
- I can hear you.

756
00:51:58,171 --> 00:51:59,570
Sorry, Faranoush.

757
00:52:00,173 --> 00:52:03,973
Anyway, I never would've met Allison
if I hadn't said yes to the homeless guy.

758
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:06,305
You wouldn't be on a date
with a strange woman.

759
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:08,879
- No offense, Faranoush.
- None taken.

760
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:12,143
I didn't realize
I was dealing with a no man.

761
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,845
No, I think it's great.
Throw this away for me, will you?

762
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,223
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

763
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:27,328
- Lucy. Faranoush, Lucy. Lucy, Faranoush.
- Hello.

764
00:52:29,436 --> 00:52:31,233
So my friends are being really lame...

765
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,567
...and nobody's offered
to throw me a bridal shower.

766
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:37,107
Hey, I have an idea.

767
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:40,345
Carl, would you like to throw Lucy
a bridal shower?

768
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:43,615
Yeah. Sure.

769
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,013
Why not? That'd be great.
Yeah, I'd love that.

770
00:52:46,186 --> 00:52:47,744
- Problem solved.
- Yeah.

771
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,653
- Really?
- Yeah.

772
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:58,855
Well, thanks, Carl.

773
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:03,293
Thanks, that's really sweet.

774
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,602
- That's great.
- That is sweet, Carl.

775
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:07,763
Thanks, Faranoush.

776
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:10,805
Oh, I forgot, I gotta pick up costumes
for me and Allison.

777
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:12,239
Costumes for what?

778
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:16,341
Expelliarmus! Just kidding.

779
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,609
That's okay. I blocked it
and deflected it back.

780
00:53:18,785 --> 00:53:22,585
Oh. Kaching!
Wow. Cool costume, my man.

781
00:53:22,756 --> 00:53:25,316
The only one they had left
was for toddlers.

782
00:53:25,492 --> 00:53:28,757
This is Allison
and her wand made from a sequoia.

783
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:31,024
- Hi.
- You must be Norman.

784
00:53:31,197 --> 00:53:35,361
Yes, nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming. Come in.

785
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,364
Yeah, we've got, well, drinks,
you know...

786
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,166
...chips, dips...

787
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:44,674
...and good people, just like you two.

788
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:46,809
- Thanks.
- Pace yourselves.

789
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,709
It's gonna be a crazy night.

790
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,116
- Get in there, play the zone.
- Come on.

791
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,815
- Good dip, huh, H.P.?
- Mm.

792
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:04,157
Got tons of it at Costco. You see, I've got
an exclusive membership card.

793
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,299
And with that card, I get access
to the whole place.

794
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:11,062
I can buy large quantities of anything
at discount prices.

795
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:13,598
Can't anyone get one of those cards?

796
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:17,736
No, don't think so.
But I can talk to someone, if you'd like.

797
00:54:18,511 --> 00:54:21,105
- Yeah, put in a good word for us.
- That would be great.

798
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:25,751
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

799
00:54:26,085 --> 00:54:29,612
"I'm not going home, not really."

800
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,255
Oh, bye.

801
00:54:38,765 --> 00:54:42,223
Alrighty, gang.
Who wants to watch Chamber of Secrets?

802
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:53,904
- Well, thanks for coming, guys.
- So nice to meet you.

803
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,605
Good to meet you, too. Thank you.
And hey.

804
00:54:56,783 --> 00:55:00,014
That's right. Come in. I'll go in.

805
00:55:00,186 --> 00:55:03,986
Keep your hand there like in a shake.
The other hand goes around for a hug.

806
00:55:04,157 --> 00:55:07,490
- Yeah. Tap it.
- Thanks for walking me through that.

807
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,457
- That's all right.
- Bye.

808
00:55:09,629 --> 00:55:12,723
Okay, guys,
all aboard the Hogwarts Express.

809
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:14,958
Next stop, Azkaban.

810
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:24,671
Hey.

811
00:55:25,078 --> 00:55:27,239
Do you wanna drive?

812
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,920
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

813
00:55:38,258 --> 00:55:40,556
Whoa. Yep, I got it.

814
00:55:46,332 --> 00:55:48,630
I got an idea.

815
00:55:54,307 --> 00:55:58,607
- We can't do this.
- Why? You scared?

816
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:06,050
Hurry. Somebody's coming.
And I think I see something. Hurry.

817
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:13,858
- This is crazy.
- I know, but it's great.

818
00:56:39,852 --> 00:56:42,412
This is unreal.

819
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:44,782
I couldn't agree more.

820
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:56,332
Ooh

821
00:56:58,638 --> 00:57:00,128
Ooh

822
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,175
Ooh

823
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:26,462
You know, I've never let anyone
drive my scooter before.

824
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,797
I've never let anyone kiss me
on the stage of the Hollywood Bowl before.

825
00:57:55,228 --> 00:57:57,287
Good evening, Los Angeles.

826
00:57:57,463 --> 00:58:00,660
Please welcome to the Hollywood Bowl
Munchausen by Proxy.

827
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:03,962
I'm your biggest fan. Bang!

828
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:05,331
I killed her.

829
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:08,101
I'm a somebody.

830
00:58:09,308 --> 00:58:11,503
I don't know about that.

831
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:14,271
- Come on, you gotta have creepy fans.
- I don't think so.

832
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:17,644
- We don't have that much of a following.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:58:17,817 --> 00:58:20,547
Rodrigo and the guys at the bar.
They can't be trusted.

834
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,714
There's me and my friends. That makes
eight or nine very unstable people.

835
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:30,056
- How many people can this place even hold?
- Like 17,000.

836
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:35,098
So each one of us invites 1800
of our closest friends.

837
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:38,203
No need.
I know our music isn't that mainstream.

838
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:40,202
- What?
- I love doing it.

839
00:58:40,706 --> 00:58:42,173
It's like my photography.

840
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:44,809
I know there isn't that much demand
for photographs...

841
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:46,569
...taken while running, but...

842
00:58:46,746 --> 00:58:48,873
I wasn't gonna say anything.

843
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:52,575
You know, who cares?
The world's a playground.

844
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:54,344
You know that when you're a kid...

845
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,148
...but somewhere along the way,
everyone forgets it.

846
00:58:57,957 --> 00:58:59,891
I love your music.

847
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:02,992
Anybody can take a photo standing still.

848
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:07,558
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Oh, shit.

849
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:09,394
- Stop.
- Stopping.

850
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:11,867
- Come on, Carl, run.
- Thanks.

851
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:13,437
- Wait right there.
- You got it.

852
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:15,369
- Down on the ground.
- Whatever you say.

853
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:19,978
- Carl, what are you doing? Let's go.
- All right. I can't please everyone.

854
00:59:23,149 --> 00:59:24,377
Run!

855
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,345
Hello, everybody.

856
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:31,957
A little vitamin C. Keep your strength up.
I will be right with you.

857
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:34,286
- Pass those out, will you?
- Sure.

858
00:59:38,698 --> 00:59:41,394
- Lee?
- Hey.

859
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,035
What up, my brizzo?

860
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:48,465
- That's not right, is it?
- Carl, I need you for a second.

861
00:59:49,575 --> 00:59:51,941
Can you hang on a minute, Lee?

862
00:59:53,379 --> 00:59:55,438
What's going on, Norm?

863
00:59:55,615 --> 00:59:57,446
Something's going down on a big scale.

864
00:59:57,617 --> 01:00:01,576
Guy from Corporate's here. Don't look.
He wants to talk to you.

865
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:04,917
I think it's about all those loans
you've been approving.

866
01:00:05,558 --> 01:00:08,322
Well, we had a nice run.

867
01:00:08,494 --> 01:00:10,758
I might get shit-canned, Norm.

868
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:14,089
Anyway, don't worry about it.
It'll lead to something good.

869
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:16,394
- Hey, I'm part of this too.
- No.

870
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:19,003
- Yeah. I stood by and let it happen.
- Norm.

871
01:00:19,172 --> 01:00:21,800
You were feeling it.
You were in the loan zone, remember?

872
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:23,236
- I was.
- I was watching you.

873
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:24,637
Yeah, you were.

874
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:28,337
But I'm afraid it's caught up with us.
Now you and I have to face the music.

875
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:31,677
- Come on.
- Hey. Can I have one minute?

876
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:34,820
- Okay.
- Lee? What do you need?

877
01:00:34,987 --> 01:00:36,818
You may be my last loan.

878
01:00:38,824 --> 01:00:40,553
It's a Ducati.

879
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:44,218
I'm thinking it'll get people off my back
about the male nurse thing.

880
01:00:45,565 --> 01:00:49,057
- See what I mean?
- Yeah. Nice ride.

881
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:53,699
See you on the other side, Lee.

882
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:58,170
Carl.

883
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:03,743
Wesley T. Parker.
Vice President, Brea Federal Savings.

884
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,816
Pleasure to meet you.

885
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:17,656
Every two months, the typical loan officer
approves 35 to 40 loans.

886
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,855
You have given out...

887
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:22,601
...561.

888
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:24,826
A little more than average, then.

889
01:01:25,004 --> 01:01:27,370
What's even more unusual
are the amounts.

890
01:01:27,873 --> 01:01:34,779
A $250 loan for a mountain bike,
$600 for windsurfing lessons.

891
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:36,881
Have you ever tried that? It's fun.

892
01:01:37,049 --> 01:01:40,041
Carl, this bank traditionally has never
given out small loans.

893
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:42,346
- If I can explain... Yeah, certainly.
- Sit down.

894
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:44,989
At first I thought
you might be raiding our coffers.

895
01:01:45,191 --> 01:01:48,183
- I would never do that.
- I would if I could, so why wouldn't you?

896
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,991
But...

897
01:01:58,237 --> 01:01:59,568
But then I looked closer.

898
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:03,035
These people are so grateful
to have their needs met...

899
01:02:03,209 --> 01:02:06,337
...more than 98 percent of them
are following through with payments.

900
01:02:06,512 --> 01:02:08,605
And because you've given out
so many of them...

901
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:13,047
...we're actually making a lot of money.
Carl, these micro-Ioans, not bad.

902
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:15,478
See, Car, you worrywart.

903
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:19,216
Carl, what would you say if I asked you
to work upstairs with the big boys?

904
01:02:19,425 --> 01:02:21,655
- Corporate?
- Wow.

905
01:02:21,894 --> 01:02:23,987
That's great. I would have to say...

906
01:02:24,163 --> 01:02:26,996
No, wait. Before we give our answer...

907
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,327
...let's talk money.
Dollars and cents, Wes.

908
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:33,404
I'm afraid I can't discuss that with you,
since we're only taking Carl.

909
01:02:33,906 --> 01:02:35,271
Got it. Yep.

910
01:02:35,441 --> 01:02:38,410
We'll have the employment contract to you
by the end of the day.

911
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:41,102
Nice work, Carl. Bump my fist.

912
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,774
- Missed it. I was gonna fist you.
- Here's some fist.

913
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,356
This one is nice.

914
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:56,927
I especially love it in cream.
What do you think?

915
01:02:57,096 --> 01:02:58,120
- I love it.
- Yeah?

916
01:02:58,297 --> 01:02:59,662
Yeah.

917
01:02:59,832 --> 01:03:03,393
Bridal bingo?
How do you play bridal bingo?

918
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:05,298
It's the same as regular bingo...

919
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:09,100
...but you just yell embarrassing facts
about the bride, okay?

920
01:03:10,176 --> 01:03:11,200
Yeah.

921
01:03:11,377 --> 01:03:13,277
- No, I'm not doing bridal bingo.
- Come on.

922
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:15,038
I don't want anything complicated.

923
01:03:15,214 --> 01:03:18,012
You gotta squeeze every drop of juice
out of this experience.

924
01:03:18,184 --> 01:03:20,618
It doesn't sound complicated.
Is it complicated?

925
01:03:20,786 --> 01:03:24,381
Are you going to be asking a lot
more question? I don't got all day.

926
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,753
- Maybe we should just go somewhere else.
- It's okay. I'll talk to her.

927
01:04:20,646 --> 01:04:21,670
Okay.

928
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:27,886
Okay, bridal bingo very simple, okay?

929
01:04:28,053 --> 01:04:31,489
I can explain to you in more detail
if you want.

930
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:39,359
What's going on?

931
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,159
I mean, someone's trying to kill himself.

932
01:04:44,437 --> 01:04:46,029
Jump.

933
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:49,130
What the hell are you looking at?

934
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:53,703
- Don't do it.
- Don't point at me, buddy.

935
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:55,779
Hey, lady, move that dog.

936
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:58,942
Buddy, can you move over a little bit,
like two feet?

937
01:04:59,118 --> 01:05:00,585
Has somebody called the police?

938
01:05:00,753 --> 01:05:04,211
Yeah. He'll be dead before they get here.
Somebody needs to talk him down.

939
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,723
- Move out the way.
- Somebody help him!

940
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:27,969
Don't do it.

941
01:05:30,082 --> 01:05:31,982
It can't be that bad.

942
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:35,785
Hey, buddy.

943
01:05:36,422 --> 01:05:37,912
Who are you, man?

944
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:41,787
Don't try anything. I'm gonna kill myself,
so don't try to stop me.

945
01:05:42,428 --> 01:05:44,896
- Okay.
- What do mean, "Okay"?

946
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:48,591
No, I don't mean okay.
Just give me a second.

947
01:05:49,168 --> 01:05:51,295
I should say something to you here.

948
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:54,530
I don't really know what it is.

949
01:05:54,707 --> 01:05:56,800
Man, you terrible at this.
Are you even a cop?

950
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:58,944
Hold on a second, I'm thinking.

951
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:04,782
Wait. I've got it.

952
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,347
Where you going, man?

953
01:06:09,522 --> 01:06:12,286
- I know it's not what I think it is.
- Just stop.

954
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,016
Oh, man.

955
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:23,265
- My man. Hello?
- Don't do it. I'm coming.

956
01:06:23,435 --> 01:06:25,995
Patience is a virtue.

957
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:31,876
What the hell you doing in there?

958
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,710
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

959
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:45,388
You could cut ties with all the lies
That you've been living in

960
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:49,153
And if you never want to see me again

961
01:06:49,328 --> 01:06:54,493
I would understand

962
01:06:54,667 --> 01:07:01,664
I would understand

963
01:07:02,007 --> 01:07:03,838
Um... Oh...

964
01:07:04,276 --> 01:07:05,402
What is it?

965
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:08,906
The angry boy a bit too insane

966
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:11,912
Icing over a secret pain

967
01:07:12,084 --> 01:07:17,317
You know you don't belong

968
01:07:17,489 --> 01:07:21,653
Everyone I know has got a reason

969
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:23,584
To say

970
01:07:23,762 --> 01:07:25,252
You can put the past away

971
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:29,458
I wish you would step back
From that ledge, my friend

972
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:34,368
You could cut ties with all the lies
You've been living in

973
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,237
And if you never want to see me again

974
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:43,109
I would understand

975
01:07:43,282 --> 01:07:46,115
I would understand

976
01:07:48,053 --> 01:07:52,854
I would understand

977
01:07:53,025 --> 01:07:57,018
I would understand

978
01:07:57,796 --> 01:08:00,196
I would understand

979
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:11,467
I got blisters on my fingers.

980
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:21,377
Carl.

981
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,380
Stephanie, Ted, hey.

982
01:08:24,556 --> 01:08:26,649
How's it going?
What are you guys doing here?

983
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:30,591
We're doing a week in Tahiti. Ted's father
owns a little piece of property there.

984
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:35,063
A hundred acres isn't so little, hon.
Not in Tahiti, anyway.

985
01:08:36,101 --> 01:08:40,060
Hey, I saw you on TV.
That was amazing, Carl.

986
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,333
It's just a little life that needed saving.
No big deal.

987
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:45,977
- So where you headed?
- I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

988
01:08:46,145 --> 01:08:48,079
- We don't know where we're going.
- Really?

989
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,808
Yeah, we're just gonna pick a place.
Kind of an eenie, meenie, minie thing.

990
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:55,283
Keeps it fresh. I'll see you guys.

991
01:08:56,955 --> 01:08:59,549
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Can you imagine?

992
01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:01,420
No.

993
01:09:13,038 --> 01:09:14,767
So I have some carry-on here.

994
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:19,343
I'd like two tickets on the first plane
out of here, please.

995
01:09:19,511 --> 01:09:21,103
We've never done this before.

996
01:09:23,849 --> 01:09:28,309
The next flight available for boarding...

997
01:09:28,887 --> 01:09:30,320
...is to Lincoln, Nebraska.

998
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:33,315
Okay.

999
01:09:33,492 --> 01:09:34,516
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
01:09:34,693 --> 01:09:35,853
- Yeah?
- Lincoln.

1001
01:09:36,028 --> 01:09:37,188
Here we come.

1002
01:09:41,133 --> 01:09:43,328
Where does someone go
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

1003
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:46,528
Well, clearly we should go there.

1004
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:54,539
"The earliest switchboard
operators' headsets...

1005
01:09:54,713 --> 01:09:56,977
...weighed over 10 and a half pounds."

1006
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:59,947
- Interesting.
- Look at this.

1007
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:03,921
- Very first phone call ever.
- Pretty cool.

1008
01:10:04,089 --> 01:10:05,784
Check out the phone.

1009
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:09,485
Smaller than I thought they would be.
Hold on, I'm vibrating.

1010
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:11,561
Hello?

1011
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:17,368
Nice shot.

1012
01:10:19,471 --> 01:10:23,066
- What do you know about that?
- Pretty sexy.

1013
01:10:23,976 --> 01:10:25,876
So, what do I do? I just...

1014
01:10:27,579 --> 01:10:29,979
- Take it easy.
- Here you go.

1015
01:10:31,817 --> 01:10:33,842
- Okay.
- You got it.

1016
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:35,043
Pull?

1017
01:10:36,922 --> 01:10:38,981
- Good one.
- I got it. I got it.

1018
01:10:39,158 --> 01:10:42,059
Can I do it again? Can I do it again?
What's wrong?

1019
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it...

1020
01:10:50,169 --> 01:10:54,435
... for your University
of Nebraska Cornhuskers.

1021
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:04,449
Twenty bucks says
Oklahoma kills them.

1022
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:07,176
Hey, Pete, you mind putting that
on a coaster?

1023
01:11:07,352 --> 01:11:08,944
What, do you live here now?

1024
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:12,750
Yeah. I asked Carl and he had to say yes.

1025
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:15,587
Hey. Is that Carl?

1026
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,888
- Wait a second.
- Wait a second, wait a second.

1027
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:24,531
The energy is palpable here,
Chris. I can't even hear myself think.

1028
01:11:25,504 --> 01:11:28,200
- I guess they're in Nebraska.
- Wow.

1029
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:33,403
Now, this is the really interesting part.
If you don't take the heads off properly...

1030
01:11:33,579 --> 01:11:36,070
...then everything gets mixed
into the batch.

1031
01:11:36,248 --> 01:11:39,240
Someone gets a beak in their bucket
or a mouthful of tendons...

1032
01:11:39,418 --> 01:11:42,182
...and you got a lawsuit on your hands.

1033
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:45,683
We got a fainter down in Head Removal.

1034
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:53,358
I can't believe
I tripped like that.

1035
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,261
- It seemed like you fainted.
- No, I told you my foot caught a nail.

1036
01:11:58,437 --> 01:12:02,032
- Okay. Because I thought it was
all the chicken beaks in the bucket.

1037
01:12:02,207 --> 01:12:04,072
Don't, please.

1038
01:12:05,844 --> 01:12:08,176
Oh, God. It's starting to rain.

1039
01:12:09,514 --> 01:12:11,880
Here. I have to protect you.

1040
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:13,640
Come on.

1041
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:17,687
Hurry, there's no time to lose.
We have to find shelter.

1042
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:19,551
Come on.

1043
01:12:20,993 --> 01:12:24,588
Get in here. It's okay. I got you.

1044
01:12:24,763 --> 01:12:27,493
Allison, are you okay?

1045
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:31,465
Are you hurt? Are you hurt? You're okay?

1046
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:39,307
What?

1047
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:42,937
I don't know. I think I love you.

1048
01:12:44,349 --> 01:12:45,816
Really?

1049
01:12:45,984 --> 01:12:50,580
I've known that I like you for a while,
but just now I decided that I love you.

1050
01:12:50,756 --> 01:12:54,055
- Do you love me?
- Definitely.

1051
01:12:54,226 --> 01:12:55,955
I love you like...

1052
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:59,760
...I can't believe it.
It's kind of ridiculous.

1053
01:13:00,565 --> 01:13:02,032
I've been thinking...

1054
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,691
...and I know it's crazy,
especially for me...

1055
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:09,739
...but maybe when we get back
we should move in together.

1056
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:14,409
Wow. Really? You've been thinking that?

1057
01:13:14,913 --> 01:13:16,540
What do you think?

1058
01:13:16,715 --> 01:13:21,152
- What do I think? Uh... Yeah.
- Oh, God. You paused.

1059
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,787
- No, I didn't pause.
- You paused.

1060
01:13:22,955 --> 01:13:24,923
No, I didn't pause.
It was just a big step.

1061
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:27,718
It was a stupid idea.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1062
01:13:27,893 --> 01:13:31,795
Come on, what are you talking about?
Here, ask me again.

1063
01:13:32,664 --> 01:13:33,995
- Do you wanna move...
- Yes.

1064
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:38,660
Did I pause there? I could probably knock
a couple milliseconds off that if you...

1065
01:13:53,452 --> 01:13:57,081
- Where are you traveling today?
- Los Angeles.

1066
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:02,723
I'll just be one minute.

1067
01:14:02,894 --> 01:14:06,386
We should do this every weekend.
We could see the whole world.

1068
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:08,396
I'm in.

1069
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:11,397
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1070
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:15,738
Sir?

1071
01:14:17,109 --> 01:14:20,078
- You mind coming with us, please?
- I'm sorry?

1072
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:23,078
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

1073
01:14:25,717 --> 01:14:28,447
You're hilarious. Oh, that's great.

1074
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:31,418
Oh, beautiful. Are you in on this too?

1075
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:33,751
Oh, my God, you guys really
had me going there.

1076
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:36,758
There's a crazy man in the terminal.
Red alert.

1077
01:14:38,196 --> 01:14:40,528
- Oh, good job.
- Let's go, funny guy.

1078
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:42,291
Come on, lady.

1079
01:14:44,036 --> 01:14:47,301
- Do you hate your country, Mr. Allen?
- What?

1080
01:14:47,472 --> 01:14:51,636
- Do you hate America?
- No. Of course not.

1081
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:53,778
Then why are you plotting to attack it?

1082
01:14:53,945 --> 01:14:55,936
- What?
- I think you have the wrong guy.

1083
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:57,945
I'm sorry. Was I speaking to you?

1084
01:14:58,116 --> 01:15:00,277
We've been tracking you.
We know who you are.

1085
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:04,013
- We know what you're planning.
- This is insane. Do you think I'm a terrorist?

1086
01:15:04,189 --> 01:15:07,022
Why did you purchase these plane tickets
at the last minute?

1087
01:15:07,192 --> 01:15:09,285
It was a spontaneous vacation.

1088
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:11,395
Right. I was just saying
to Agent Tweed...

1089
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:14,828
...how I wanted to take a fun-filled
vacation to Lincoln, Nebraska.

1090
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,130
Are you currently a member
of Persianwifefinder. Com?

1091
01:15:19,337 --> 01:15:22,363
- Yes, but you don't understand.
- Yes? Who is that?

1092
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:25,669
Faranoush. It was nothing. I can explain.
I can explain.

1093
01:15:25,844 --> 01:15:29,610
Explain this, jackhole. As Chief Loan Officer
at Brea Federal Savings and Loan...

1094
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:32,306
you gave a man money
to start a fertilizer business.

1095
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:33,974
- For what, bombs?
- No.

1096
01:15:34,152 --> 01:15:36,347
Have you recently
started taking flying lessons?

1097
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:39,046
- Yes. Oh, come on.
- Why did you learn Korean?

1098
01:15:39,224 --> 01:15:41,624
- Are you aligned with the North Koreans?
- No. What?

1099
01:15:41,793 --> 01:15:44,353
You were married for six months.
Some immigration thing?

1100
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:46,656
- You were married?
- Yes.

1101
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,827
That was a long time ago.
I was gonna tell you.

1102
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:52,629
I was gonna tell her. I just never...

1103
01:15:52,804 --> 01:15:55,739
Start talking, Carl,
if that is your real name.

1104
01:15:56,875 --> 01:16:00,902
We knew another Karl we weren't
too crazy about, didn't we, Tweed?

1105
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:04,079
His name was Marx.

1106
01:16:07,786 --> 01:16:10,016
I need to speak to my attorney.

1107
01:16:14,726 --> 01:16:17,854
Several months ago, my client
attended a self-empowerment seminar...

1108
01:16:18,029 --> 01:16:22,864
...that requires him to say yes
to any request that's presented.

1109
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:25,127
All of the activity
that appears suspicious...

1110
01:16:25,303 --> 01:16:28,397
...the flying lessons,
the spontaneous trip-taking...

1111
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:31,303
...it's all because he must say yes
to any opportunity.

1112
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:34,808
- He's really into it.
- You say yes to everything?

1113
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,880
- Are you kidding?
- It's not how it sounds.

1114
01:16:37,048 --> 01:16:38,640
How does it?
I'd love to hear this.

1115
01:16:38,817 --> 01:16:41,877
I'm wondering if there's a better setting
for this back and forth.

1116
01:16:42,053 --> 01:16:45,022
Maybe we should speak privately.
Come on outside.

1117
01:16:47,826 --> 01:16:50,989
- Whew. That was close.
- What the hell, Carl?

1118
01:16:51,163 --> 01:16:53,131
Are you serious?
You say yes to everything?

1119
01:16:53,298 --> 01:16:56,165
- Even if you don't like it?
- No, of course not.

1120
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:58,726
- Sometimes.
- Oh, good. What a relief.

1121
01:16:58,904 --> 01:17:02,635
I thought you lied all the time, but it's
just sometimes. That's excellent.

1122
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:04,536
So you didn't wanna
come to my show...

1123
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:08,076
...you didn't wanna go jogging with me,
you didn't wanna travel with me?

1124
01:17:08,246 --> 01:17:10,077
Yes, I did. That was my idea.

1125
01:17:10,248 --> 01:17:12,239
When I asked you
if you wanted to move in...

1126
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:14,851
...that took a lot for me to do that,
and I meant it.

1127
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,648
I didn't know what to expect,
but I guess I figured...

1128
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:20,154
...like an adult, you were gonna
weigh the options.

1129
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:21,519
You paused.

1130
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:24,355
You wanted to say no but you couldn't.
You had to say yes.

1131
01:17:24,529 --> 01:17:28,659
- That's not entirely true.
- How do I know if anything you did...

1132
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:32,997
...was because you wanted to or because
you were following some damn program?

1133
01:17:40,645 --> 01:17:41,907
Allison.

1134
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:45,082
Bye, Carl.

1135
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:02,892
I can't believe I didn't tell her
I was married. I'm such an idiot.

1136
01:18:03,668 --> 01:18:05,260
- You know what I did?
- What's that?

1137
01:18:05,437 --> 01:18:08,634
She asked me to move in with her
and I hesitated. That was like a no.

1138
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:10,798
I should have said yes right away,
you know?

1139
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:13,945
That's how the whole thing got
screwed up. I broke the covenant.

1140
01:18:14,112 --> 01:18:15,739
Ever think things got screwed up...

1141
01:18:15,914 --> 01:18:19,782
...because you said yes without thinking,
not because of a covenant you made?

1142
01:18:19,951 --> 01:18:21,919
It's with the universe.
It's a big deal.

1143
01:18:22,087 --> 01:18:24,555
There is a middle ground here.
You can process things.

1144
01:18:24,723 --> 01:18:28,284
You can weigh them individually and
make decisions on a case-by-case basis...

1145
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,927
...a.k.a. What normal people do.

1146
01:18:30,095 --> 01:18:32,859
Yeah, that's a good point.
Hold that thought. Allison!

1147
01:18:33,031 --> 01:18:34,157
Or not.

1148
01:18:34,332 --> 01:18:36,232
Allison, please, can't we talk for a sec?

1149
01:18:36,401 --> 01:18:37,891
- Get away from me.
- Okay.

1150
01:18:38,703 --> 01:18:40,034
- Farther.
- Yeah.

1151
01:18:42,007 --> 01:18:43,406
Carl.

1152
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:48,746
Bye, Carl.

1153
01:18:49,547 --> 01:18:52,448
- Oh, I just love good food.
- So do I.

1154
01:18:52,617 --> 01:18:54,448
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

1155
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:56,553
You know you and I are a lot alike?

1156
01:18:57,789 --> 01:19:00,121
My mother likes good food.

1157
01:19:00,992 --> 01:19:03,620
She always used to say,
"I'd rather eat good food...

1158
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:05,729
... than bad food any old day
of the week. "

1159
01:19:05,897 --> 01:19:07,455
Hey.

1160
01:19:07,766 --> 01:19:09,631
It's me again.

1161
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:12,269
Specifically I'm talking about 15
to 20 percent.

1162
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:15,406
The way we're gonna do this
is we're gonna go after the...

1163
01:19:31,323 --> 01:19:34,121
Okay, I'm totally off the controls.

1164
01:19:34,993 --> 01:19:37,655
You're officially flying by yourself.

1165
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,720
Cool.

1166
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:44,192
There's no greater feeling in the world,
is there?

1167
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:52,900
Hello, Jake, Rodrigo,
Penelope, Phillip, Zachary.

1168
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:54,909
I'd like to thank you all for coming...

1169
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,208
...for no other reason
than you genuinely wanted to.

1170
01:19:58,383 --> 01:20:02,046
In an unrelated note,
everyone else can go jump off a bridge.

1171
01:20:14,099 --> 01:20:15,794
Ah!

1172
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:34,645
Allison?

1173
01:20:34,819 --> 01:20:38,949
No, it's Wes P., Big C.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

1174
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:44,187
- No, no, I'm just hanging here.
- Okay, okay. Just checking in.

1175
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:46,193
Seeing how Corporate's treating you.

1176
01:20:46,364 --> 01:20:48,764
Kicks the crap out of dealing
with those peons, huh?

1177
01:20:48,933 --> 01:20:52,664
- I never really thought of them as...
- Hang on, hang on, hang on, just a second.

1178
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:58,167
Wes? Can you hear me?

1179
01:20:58,343 --> 01:20:59,605
Go get the ball!

1180
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:03,214
So listen, I got a job for you.
We're shutting down a bunch of branches...

1181
01:21:03,381 --> 01:21:07,283
...and I need you to tell the managers.
- Shutting down branches?

1182
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:09,186
Which ones?

1183
01:21:10,855 --> 01:21:13,483
We are Sparta!

1184
01:21:17,228 --> 01:21:18,661
Hi, Norm.

1185
01:21:41,886 --> 01:21:44,184
You have three messages.

1186
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:47,085
Hi, Car, this is your
answer phone speaking.

1187
01:21:47,258 --> 01:21:50,125
No, it's me, Norm, just a reminder
about the party tonight.

1188
01:21:50,295 --> 01:21:53,355
I'll see you there, buddy. Roger, out.

1189
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:56,563
Carl, it's Roons.
Thanks for letting me use your car.

1190
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:59,294
You might notice the front bumper missing.
Not to worry.

1191
01:21:59,471 --> 01:22:02,235
I gave them your insurance.
The whole thing's being handled.

1192
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:06,776
And I left a pile of laundry in my room.
Don't forget, no starch. Love you.

1193
01:22:07,378 --> 01:22:10,404
It's Peter. I'm sure you're aware
and completely on top of it...

1194
01:22:10,582 --> 01:22:14,348
... but just wanted to make sure Lucy's
shower is still on for tomorrow night.

1195
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:17,647
Haven't received confirmation
of any sort from you. At all.

1196
01:22:17,822 --> 01:22:20,484
- Shower. Shit.
- It's on.

1197
01:22:20,658 --> 01:22:22,626
Right? Call me.

1198
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:36,163
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1199
01:22:36,341 --> 01:22:38,901
- What's wrong?
- I just really need to talk to you.

1200
01:22:39,077 --> 01:22:40,339
What?

1201
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,174
Come on inside. I'll explain everything.

1202
01:22:48,419 --> 01:22:50,683
Surprise!

1203
01:22:50,855 --> 01:22:53,449
- Oh, my God.
- Happy shower.

1204
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:55,092
How did you pull this off?

1205
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,922
I just called in a few favors,
kept throwing money at it.

1206
01:22:58,663 --> 01:23:00,961
I like it, I like it.

1207
01:23:01,132 --> 01:23:02,565
- Rooney.
- Congrats.

1208
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:04,827
- That's Bert. He's in fertilizer.
- Hey, B.

1209
01:23:05,003 --> 01:23:07,164
- And Lee, he's a male nurse.
- I know Lee.

1210
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:10,472
Let's get this guy a drink.
He doesn't have long to live.

1211
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:13,133
On him, on him.

1212
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:17,171
Cake?

1213
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:18,372
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1214
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:22,953
- Oh, John Goodman.
- No, it's Alec Baldwin.

1215
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:27,514
Oh, right. Nailed it.

1216
01:23:33,965 --> 01:23:37,958
Norm. Hey, thanks for coming, man.

1217
01:23:38,136 --> 01:23:40,969
- How you holding up?
- I'm okay, Car.

1218
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:44,006
You know, taking her day by day.

1219
01:23:44,175 --> 01:23:47,008
Yeah. Well, I got a friend
I want you to meet.

1220
01:23:47,412 --> 01:23:48,538
Oh.

1221
01:23:52,951 --> 01:23:57,388
- Norman, this is Soo-Mi.
- Hi there.

1222
01:23:59,257 --> 01:24:03,626
- Can I call you Soo?
- Yes.

1223
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:04,819
Do you dance?

1224
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:07,887
Well, I've won some competitions.
Watch this.

1225
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:11,627
- Come on.
- Look out. Oh, hey.

1226
01:24:37,895 --> 01:24:43,527
- Oh, that's an interesting one.
- Yep. And it's half-price, so...

1227
01:24:47,839 --> 01:24:49,704
Oh, jeez.

1228
01:24:50,308 --> 01:24:53,607
- That's the best wedding shower ever, man.
- Man, you deserve it.

1229
01:24:53,778 --> 01:24:55,746
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:24:55,913 --> 01:24:59,007
- Yeah? She's still not calling you back?
- No.

1231
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:01,708
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1232
01:25:01,886 --> 01:25:05,947
I guess I'll just stick with the program.
Keep saying yes to everything.

1233
01:25:06,124 --> 01:25:07,716
I know it sounds silly...

1234
01:25:07,892 --> 01:25:10,452
...but maybe that bad stuff
will lead to something good.

1235
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:14,928
Doesn't sound silly.
Well, maybe a little silly.

1236
01:25:15,533 --> 01:25:17,228
You wanna get dinner tomorrow night?

1237
01:25:17,402 --> 01:25:20,394
- Yes. And not because I have to.
- Great.

1238
01:25:20,571 --> 01:25:23,199
- Well, you do have to.
- Yeah.

1239
01:25:24,142 --> 01:25:26,872
- But you want to.
- Oh, yeah.

1240
01:25:27,045 --> 01:25:29,513
- So bad.
- Oh, God, me too.

1241
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:31,649
- It's all I can think about.
- Really?

1242
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:39,021
Hi there.

1243
01:25:39,957 --> 01:25:41,584
Hello there.

1244
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,329
You must be Tillie.

1245
01:25:46,364 --> 01:25:51,358
- I've certainly heard a lot about you.
- Isn't that nice?

1246
01:25:54,872 --> 01:26:00,970
- Would you mind helping me?
- Absolutely, yeah. No problem.

1247
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,109
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:16,518
- Hello?
- Hi, Carl.

1249
01:26:17,161 --> 01:26:23,031
- Oh, Stephanie. What's wrong?
- Can you come over?

1250
01:26:23,201 --> 01:26:26,068
We had this big fight and he stormed off.

1251
01:26:26,237 --> 01:26:30,105
Well, these things have a way
of working themselves out.

1252
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,003
I don't know.

1253
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:36,903
- Not this time. I think it's over.
- Yeah?

1254
01:26:38,249 --> 01:26:40,717
You know,
but maybe it's supposed to be.

1255
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:45,151
I mean, a part of me felt like something
wasn't right from the beginning.

1256
01:26:45,323 --> 01:26:49,657
- Yeah?
- I don't know, Carl. I'm so confused.

1257
01:26:49,827 --> 01:26:56,096
Yeah. I'm gonna assume at this point,
it's, well...

1258
01:26:56,267 --> 01:26:59,236
- Stay with me tonight.
- Oh, Steph...

1259
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:05,804
Steph...

1260
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:08,308
...I can't.

1261
01:27:08,946 --> 01:27:10,641
I'm sorry.

1262
01:27:13,151 --> 01:27:15,085
What are you saying?

1263
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:18,916
I'm saying no.

1264
01:27:35,406 --> 01:27:36,873
Are you serious?

1265
01:27:51,255 --> 01:27:52,415
Oh, Jesus.

1266
01:27:59,897 --> 01:28:02,422
Oh, please.

1267
01:28:02,934 --> 01:28:06,563
I didn't even see the red zone.
I've only been here for 20 minutes.

1268
01:28:06,737 --> 01:28:10,798
- Sorry, pal. Can't help you.
- Oh, come on. Can't you give me a break?

1269
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:14,809
No, man, no, man, no, man.

1270
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:19,177
- No man, no man, no man...
- Not possible!

1271
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:23,546
Jackoff.

1272
01:28:24,622 --> 01:28:30,151
Chapter 26,
"Words That Rhyme With Yes."

1273
01:28:30,328 --> 01:28:32,956
Guess, mess.

1274
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:39,160
Tess, that's a name.
Less, a word and a name.

1275
01:28:39,337 --> 01:28:41,305
- Terrence, don't freak out.
- What the fuck?

1276
01:29:05,963 --> 01:29:08,727
Jesus, that nurse couldn't be
any more obvious.

1277
01:29:10,134 --> 01:29:13,831
She was coming in the room. It's like,
"Give me some space, woman."

1278
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:17,566
Again, I'm pretty sure
she was just here checking on Carl.

1279
01:29:17,842 --> 01:29:19,776
Peter.

1280
01:29:20,511 --> 01:29:22,172
A covenant.

1281
01:29:22,346 --> 01:29:24,644
Hey, buddy, you all right?

1282
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:28,218
The covenant, it's coming down
hard on me, man.

1283
01:29:29,086 --> 01:29:31,919
- He keeps talking this covenant nonsense.
- It's not nonsense.

1284
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:33,556
It is nonsense.

1285
01:29:35,293 --> 01:29:36,885
It's him.

1286
01:29:38,429 --> 01:29:42,695
Oh, thank God. Terrence. You have to
remove the covenant. It's killing me.

1287
01:29:42,867 --> 01:29:45,665
First of all, what were you doing
in my car?

1288
01:29:45,836 --> 01:29:48,270
I told you,
I need you to remove the covenant.

1289
01:29:48,439 --> 01:29:52,273
There is no covenant. There never was.
I was just riffing.

1290
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:55,541
- Riffing?
- Well, I had to say something.

1291
01:29:55,713 --> 01:29:59,376
You were being difficult,
embarrassing me in front of my crowd.

1292
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:02,519
- So the whole yes thing is all bullshit?
- No.

1293
01:30:02,687 --> 01:30:04,780
You just don't know how to use it,
that's all.

1294
01:30:04,956 --> 01:30:07,857
Yeah, I do. Say yes to everything.
Real tough to grasp.

1295
01:30:08,025 --> 01:30:09,993
No, that's not the point.

1296
01:30:10,161 --> 01:30:13,961
Well, maybe at first it is,
but that's just to open you up to it...

1297
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:15,758
...to get you started.

1298
01:30:15,933 --> 01:30:18,561
Then you're saying yes,
not because you have to...

1299
01:30:18,736 --> 01:30:21,170
...not because a covenant tells you to...

1300
01:30:21,339 --> 01:30:24,274
...but because you know in your heart
that you want to.

1301
01:30:25,543 --> 01:30:27,204
Yeah.

1302
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:29,507
You're right.

1303
01:30:30,247 --> 01:30:33,148
- That makes perfect sense.
- I told you. I said that.

1304
01:30:33,317 --> 01:30:34,716
- You didn't say that.
- I did.

1305
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:37,445
- You didn't say it like that.
- Not with an accent.

1306
01:30:38,055 --> 01:30:42,116
Thanks, Terrence. Sorry about the car,
and your head there.

1307
01:30:42,927 --> 01:30:46,795
- What time is it?
- It's 5:40 in the morning.

1308
01:30:46,964 --> 01:30:48,226
Perfect.

1309
01:30:51,035 --> 01:30:52,798
I said that.

1310
01:30:53,004 --> 01:30:54,631
Whatever.

1311
01:30:56,474 --> 01:31:00,035
I'm gonna hop in the bed
just in case the nurse comes back.

1312
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:06,783
- Sir, you need to get back to your room.
- No, I don't.

1313
01:31:06,951 --> 01:31:09,283
- Sir, stop right there.
- Eat me.

1314
01:31:11,856 --> 01:31:15,815
- Lee. What are you doing here?
- I'm a nurse, remember?

1315
01:31:15,993 --> 01:31:20,362
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Can I borrow your car?

1316
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:24,968
No, I don't have my car anymore.
I've got my Ducati, thanks to you.

1317
01:31:25,603 --> 01:31:27,730
Ducati.

1318
01:31:32,676 --> 01:31:36,112
Have you ever driven one of these before?
They're quite powerful.

1319
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,477
Yeah, I ride double all the time
on the scooter with Allison.

1320
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,982
No, Carl,
this is not the same.

1321
01:31:42,153 --> 01:31:45,145
You really have to be careful. Okay?
These things have a lot of...

1322
01:31:46,157 --> 01:31:48,125
Holy Jesus.

1323
01:31:48,292 --> 01:31:49,554
- Torque.

1324
01:32:01,972 --> 01:32:04,031
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

1325
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,138
Ah!

1326
01:32:07,645 --> 01:32:09,476
You might wanna get out of the way.

1327
01:32:20,758 --> 01:32:23,158
- Come on. Jerk.
- I'm sorry.

1328
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,288
Ah!

1329
01:32:31,168 --> 01:32:32,567
Whoa!

1330
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:18,777
What an asshole.

1331
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:36,557
Carl, what are you doing here?

1332
01:33:36,734 --> 01:33:40,636
I just wanted to tell you
that I don't wanna live with you.

1333
01:33:40,804 --> 01:33:43,898
Oh, wow. Thanks.
My knight in shining armor.

1334
01:33:44,074 --> 01:33:46,565
Okay, people, let's go.

1335
01:33:50,114 --> 01:33:51,206
But I wanna be with you.

1336
01:33:51,382 --> 01:33:53,577
But I don't wanna be with you.
I don't know you.

1337
01:33:53,751 --> 01:33:56,311
Everything I said I meant,
except about living together.

1338
01:33:56,487 --> 01:33:58,819
That makes me nervous,
but that's normal. It's big.

1339
01:33:58,989 --> 01:34:01,583
We shouldn't just jump into that
without thinking.

1340
01:34:01,759 --> 01:34:05,718
Why not? You do it with everything.
You say yes to whatever comes your way.

1341
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:08,865
That's not true. You can say no
if you don't want something.

1342
01:34:09,033 --> 01:34:11,558
Brilliant, Carl. Where'd you get that?
Your literature?

1343
01:34:11,735 --> 01:34:13,726
Look, I know the philosophy
has some holes.

1344
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:17,670
You think? Seems pretty airtight to me.

1345
01:34:17,841 --> 01:34:20,810
But if I hadn't done that,
I never would've met you.

1346
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:24,072
Because the old Carl
didn't think he was enough for anybody.

1347
01:34:24,248 --> 01:34:27,274
I thought if I said yes to things
and got involved with people...

1348
01:34:27,451 --> 01:34:29,783
...sooner or later,
they'd find out I'm not enough.

1349
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:32,789
I didn't think I had anything to share.

1350
01:34:32,957 --> 01:34:36,222
But now I know that what I have to share
is pretty huge, and I wanna share it with you.

1351
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:39,688
- Do you mind, Reggie?
- Seriously, dude.

1352
01:34:39,863 --> 01:34:41,888
Sorry, this seemed interesting.

1353
01:34:42,499 --> 01:34:44,967
Even if I had met you,
I never would've asked you out.

1354
01:34:45,135 --> 01:34:48,468
You were the complete opposite of me.
You did things and had friends...

1355
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,699
...and sang in rock bands
and made life happen.

1356
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,809
You weren't scared of anything.

1357
01:34:53,978 --> 01:34:56,640
You don't think I'm scared of anything?

1358
01:34:56,814 --> 01:34:59,977
Who do you think I am?
I'm scared of a lot of things.

1359
01:35:00,584 --> 01:35:02,575
And I'm scared too.

1360
01:35:02,753 --> 01:35:04,812
So let's be scared together.

1361
01:35:06,757 --> 01:35:08,748
I don't know what you want me to say.

1362
01:35:09,393 --> 01:35:10,860
So just say yes...

1363
01:35:11,395 --> 01:35:13,829
...but only if you really want to.

1364
01:35:14,064 --> 01:35:17,192
And can you do it kind of soon?
I think I'm starting to get a chill.

1365
01:35:18,502 --> 01:35:20,333
Yeah, I noticed that.

1366
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:22,236
Well?

1367
01:35:29,046 --> 01:35:31,276
- Maybe.
- Come on.

1368
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:35,744
- I'm not gonna say that word.
- Okay, maybe's fine. Maybe's good.

1369
01:35:42,726 --> 01:35:44,387
I like maybe.

1370
01:35:44,561 --> 01:35:45,755
- Reggie, come on.
- Dude.

1371
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:16,148
Excuse me,
but pleats are kind of out of style.

1372
01:36:16,327 --> 01:36:18,488
You got anything with a flat front?

1373
01:36:18,662 --> 01:36:20,596
Oh, Soo-Mi, pleats are out?

1374
01:36:23,233 --> 01:36:24,666
Thanks, guys.

1375
01:36:24,835 --> 01:36:27,429
This is the single biggest donation
that we've ever had.

1376
01:36:27,604 --> 01:36:30,164
You're welcome, but it was Carl
that made it all happen.

1377
01:36:30,341 --> 01:36:31,706
You're a good man, Carl.

1378
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:36,403
No big deal. I know a lot of people
who are willing to give.

1379
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:43,217
Say it a million times.
Say it a million more times.

1380
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:47,824
And the word
you will have said 2 million times is:

1381
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:50,323
Yes!

1382
01:36:55,799 --> 01:36:57,960
Good God.

1383
01:38:32,062 --> 01:38:34,189
So anything else
we need to know?

1384
01:38:34,364 --> 01:38:38,630
Your instinct is gonna be to brake
with your chin or your forehead.

1385
01:38:38,802 --> 01:38:40,360
- Try to resist that.
- Right.

1386
01:38:40,537 --> 01:38:41,902
Right.

1387
01:38:43,173 --> 01:38:44,504
Oh, and thanks for the loan.

1388
01:38:44,675 --> 01:38:47,371
I never could have finished the suits
without it.

1389
01:38:49,079 --> 01:38:52,606
Listen, I'm not gonna think anything
less of you if you don't wanna do this.

1390
01:38:52,783 --> 01:38:53,807
What?

1391
01:38:53,984 --> 01:38:56,919
I mean, I'm still gonna be attracted
to you if you're a chicken.

1392
01:38:57,087 --> 01:38:58,748
What if I'm
one of those chickens...

1393
01:38:58,922 --> 01:39:02,221
...whose head doesn't get severed
and my beak ends up in the bucket?

1394
01:39:02,392 --> 01:39:05,327
I'll see you at the bottom.
Unless you pass out.

1395
01:39:06,063 --> 01:39:09,055
I told you,
my foot caught a nail.

1396
01:39:09,233 --> 01:39:10,461
Hiyah!

1397
01:39:57,314 --> 01:39:58,838
I love this.

1398
01:44:10,974 --> 01:44:19,665
