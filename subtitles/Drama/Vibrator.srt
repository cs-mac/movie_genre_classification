1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,937
A Vibrator Production Committee Presents

2
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,853
March 14th? Japan's extra Valentine

3
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:26,749
Will your boyfriend
buy you chocolates?

4
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:31,258
The day for men to show their love

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,392
Don't be fooled by the hype,
you morons!

6
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:44,337
What did I come here for?
Wine?

7
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,538
White, white wine

8
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:53,717
Not French, but German
So sweet!

9
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,884
Wine, wine? So sweet, so fine!

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,588
Why is there no red German wine?

11
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,451
They must make it

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,196
But it's usually white
Almost always

13
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,338
Madonna, lovely Madonna

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,702
Why is there no red German wine?

15
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,502
They must make it

16
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,075
But it's usually white...

17
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,571
Shut up!

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,943
What must people think of you?

19
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:34,049
They can't think you're normal

20
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,688
A secretary after a party?

21
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,362
No, a secretary doesn't dress like this

22
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:47,200
Much too casual,
or am I worrying too much?

23
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,672
I want to touch someone

24
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,672
But sometimes I need a reason

25
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,674
I'm scared of people I can't touch

26
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:03,349
And I'm scared of people who
don't know how to touch

27
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,621
When I feel threatened
I become threatening

28
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,365
My self-defense instinct is so strong
I'm worried I might kill someone

29
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:19,235
What did I come here for?
Wine?

30
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,297
Booze is my friend

31
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,970
It helps me sleep

32
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:31,551
The voice of my conscience
or other people's voices...

33
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,186
They melt away when I drink

34
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:41,119
I fancy some aniseed vodka
but there's none

35
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:49,896
Alcohol and eating disorders are rife
but they're not in the magazines

36
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:55,039
Teenage gangsters?
That I can relate to

37
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,109
I knnow how the girls on smack feel

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:04,716
They're nno different to me
Even they want boyfriends

39
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,286
But what about me?
Am I completely alone?

40
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,431
You can feel it, can't you

41
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,900
Those subtle changes under your skin

42
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,764
Many women experience skin damage

43
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:33,777
But it isn't simply decay!
It's caused by an imbalance

44
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:39,251
It isn't your fault
You're not withering!

45
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:40,578
Oh, please!

46
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:46,953
"Are you tired?"
"Is your skin too dry?"

47
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,587
"Did you gain weight?"
"Are you losing weight?"

48
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,129
Look at the bags under your eyes

49
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,235
Frustrated?
Are you getting any?

50
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,697
You never hear men talking like this

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,506
Why do women have to
listen to this crap?

52
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,313
I don't care
I'm me

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:15,547
Maybe it's too late to do
anything about it

54
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,985
Let's get ice cream

55
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,603
Looks Like a fisherman
Tasty, though!

56
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,247
I want him
Good enough to eat!

57
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:16,706
I wonder what shampoo he uses
Smells nice

58
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,301
Take me, take me!
I'm still alive

59
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,790
Where are you?
I know it's you

60
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,558
Never mind whistling,
come and get me!

61
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:11,097
I have to go to him
I have to satisfy my appetite

62
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,501
Grab that handle

63
00:06:58,851 --> 00:06:59,818
Welcome

64
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,202
Were you watching me?
From way up here?

65
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,603
Not all the time
I thought you weren't coming

66
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,985
Drink?
It's the hard stuff

67
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,093
Yes, please

68
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,971
Of course I want a drink
I can't do anything sober

69
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,105
Thanks

70
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,655
Can I open these?

71
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,966
They're good

72
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,109
How old are you?

73
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,341
31

74
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,113
Older than me, then

75
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,319
Isn't it obvious?
How about you?

76
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,984
28

77
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,989
I thought you were younger

78
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,853
You were buying wine and gin

79
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:58,132
Some friends are coming this weekend
But I don't need it yet

80
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,204
It's only Wednesday...

81
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,738
No, it's Thursday

82
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,604
Do you want to watch TV?

83
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:08,945
OK

84
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,954
I'm afraid someone complained about
the noise of your truck's engine

85
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,394
But it's freezing?
I suppose you can't turn it off

86
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,294
Is there a park or something near here?

87
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,370
I've got a morning delivery

88
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,771
Mr. Okabe?

89
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,508
How do you say your first name?

90
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,410
It's TAKATOSHI

91
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,886
It's a bit unusual

92
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,460
You can park behind the station
Do you mind moving?

93
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,494
OK

94
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,366
Thanks

95
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,301
So you get along with policemen

96
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,171
We're both just doing our jobs

97
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,707
How long have you been a driver?

98
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,847
About 7 years

99
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,787
And before that?

100
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,783
Building contractor's office

101
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:32,230
Then I bought my first truck, and now
I do pickups with this one

102
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:33,756
Pick ups?

103
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,366
Like freelance

104
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,159
But why be a truck driver?

105
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,168
I've got no diplomas

106
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,206
I hardly even went to junior high

107
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,373
So much for compulsory education

108
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,081
If I'd graduated junior high
I might have got a certificat e

109
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,817
But I didn t even attend the ceremony

110
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,055
When I first saw you...

111
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,393
I was really taken by your boots

112
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,296
It's always snowing in Niigata
so I need them

113
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,441
It only snows a little bit in Tokyo

114
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,104
What's special about Nigata?

115
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,973
There are lots of furniture factories

116
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,404
I go to Shizuoka too

117
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,343
But mainly Niigata

118
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,843
See that apartment under construction?
I'm delivering doors there

119
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,961
You leave the engine on all night?

120
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,154
Yep

121
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,324
Why not use a kerosene heater

122
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,897
It causes less oxygen here

123
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,603
Well, an electric heater
Or a heated rug

124
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,536
Then I'd need a generator

125
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,944
I want to touch you

126
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,187
Be my guest

127
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,629
I'm scared

128
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,067
Sorry, it sounds stupid

129
00:12:55,174 --> 00:13:00,510
I worry someone I don't know
might turn nasty on me

130
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,073
I'm sorry
I don't know why

131
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,448
It's ridiculous
No one ever hit me

132
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,752
You must think I'm an idiot

133
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,260
I want to touch you

134
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,075
I want to touch you

135
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,354
Do you want to come closer?

136
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,311
There goes my contact lens

137
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,159
You're beautiful

138
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,592
Mr. Takatoshi Okabe
Do you want to know my name?

139
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,601
Just call me Takatoshi

140
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,107
Don't make me sad

141
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,737
REI. It's Rei Ha yakawa

142
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,308
You're beautiful

143
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,780
Call me by my name

144
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:10,725
Rei. My ray of sunshine
You're so beautiful

145
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,525
In what way?

146
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,991
Like a rosebud

147
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,041
Show me how you touch yourself

148
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,616
I can't do that

149
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,854
Go on, show me

150
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,555
Can you touch your breasts?

151
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,624
Suck it

152
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,044
I love you, I love you, I love you...

153
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,428
Have you got a condom?

154
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,705
Make love to me

155
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,241
If you do that, I'll come too soon

156
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,467
That's OK

157
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,779
Liquor and corn chips

158
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,240
Nothing else to puke up

159
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,359
Take me with you

160
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,830
With me?

161
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:15,905
Yep

162
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,035
OK

163
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,919
With a travelling companion
The world smiles upon you

164
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,326
Are we going to Niigata

165
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,901
No, Kawaguchi

166
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,197
Kawaguchi?

167
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,737
I have to load some tires
Can't run empty

168
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,041
Do you find the work yourself?

169
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,941
No, a company assigns it

170
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,742
I thought it was your own business

171
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,574
It's not like being an employee

172
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:38,713
But it's easier to get the right papers
if you sign on under a company

173
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,551
All of these?

174
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,754
Of course it's all of them

175
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,513
Here

176
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,527
Put this behind you

177
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,093
Show me your dick

178
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,600
No, it's soft

179
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,326
So what?

180
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,369
I'll show you when it's hard

181
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,729
Why?

182
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,601
To see it at its best

183
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,040
Hard or soft, it's still you

184
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,545
Are you serious?

185
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,442
Love me, love me, love me...

186
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,227
Are we off to Niigata now?

187
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,060
Yep

188
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,532
On the expressway?

189
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,897
No, we only use regular roads

190
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,564
If we use the expressway
we have to pay ourselves

191
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,039
I see

192
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,945
I know you said you want to
come with me...

193
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,272
Yeah...?

194
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,781
Actually, I'm married

195
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:07,188
So?
I don't care

196
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,956
But there was a little hesitation there!

197
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:16,095
I was once with a girl who ended up
nearly stalking me

198
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,099
In fact she's never given up

199
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:25,672
It's a bad situation
And she's so intense

200
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,742
What do you do?

201
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:35,176
Me? I write
Articles for magazines and stuff

202
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,982
Do you work for a company?

203
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,657
Freelance

204
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,822
A bit like me

205
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,120
So you only get paid if you write?

206
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,071
What's so good about truck driving?

207
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,068
It doesn't tie you down

208
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,209
Well, now the economy is in trouble

209
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,576
But before it was easy money

210
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:08,243
Freelance truckers used to carry
smack hidden in frozen tuna

211
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:12,749
You couldn't ask a big company
to carry stuff like that

212
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,689
The dirver must be someone you trust

213
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,862
They get to know you through
friends of friends

214
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,465
And they make sure you're
all above board

215
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,999
If not the goods could end up stolen

216
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,131
The stuff arrives frozen
somewhere in Kyushu

217
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,706
Even the sniffer dogs can't find it
when it's frozen

218
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,307
After it comes ashore
the dealers step in

219
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,346
By dealers I mean the Yakuza

220
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,506
And they tell me where to take it

221
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,814
They pay for the expressway
I got 500,000 cash

222
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:47,081
When I get to the drop off I hand the
stuff to the customer

223
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,331
Do they tell you what you carried?

224
00:28:54,666 --> 00:29:00,901
Yeah, they say do you want cash
or do you want the smack

225
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,837
I took the cash
I don't do smack

226
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,735
Do some people choose the drugs?

227
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,741
Of course

228
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,711
A lot of the Kyushu truckers do

229
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,543
It helps them stay awake on the road

230
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,315
When did you get married?

231
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,216
3 years ago

232
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,749
Any kids?

233
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:21,618
Yep

234
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,318
Boy or girl?

235
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,490
Girl

236
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:25,493
Is she cute?

237
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,530
We're not so close
I'm hardly ever home

238
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,559
Is that so...

239
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,201
Not very often

240
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,805
Haulage jobs come one after another
so they clash with going home

241
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,864
You call it "haulage"

242
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,034
That, or "on the road"

243
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,614
If you make a round trip
you're in Tokyo half the time

244
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,143
Where do you stay?

245
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,715
There's a place at the company HQ

246
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:56,221
But I hardly ever go there
My truck is my house

247
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,489
What do you call this space?

248
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,623
That's the bunk

249
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,729
Can I try it?

250
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,456
If you want

251
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,502
You can really stretch out here!

252
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,301
It has to be big enough for me

253
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:17,309
I suppose your stalker knows
that you're married

254
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:23,016
Makes no diff erence, she's in a
world of her own

255
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,456
"I'm the only one who
understands you"

256
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,821
Who does she think she is?

257
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:34,630
Someone always on the move like me
can't figure out a person like that

258
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,670
I might meet someone really cool here
but then someone in Sendai

259
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,966
Then I might go to Kyushu
and meet an even better person

260
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,335
Can I use this?

261
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,576
Yep

262
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,843
An office worker gets married and
that's the only person they see

263
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,185
They start fooling around at the office
and thats called "an affair"

264
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,620
But they don't know anything except
work and home

265
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,585
I got a call from an ambulance
the other day

266
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,128
The stupid bitch had slit her wrists!

267
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:11,998
She said she wouldn't get in unless
the paramedics contacted me!

268
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,331
So I told her on the phone
"Go ahead and die"

269
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,530
To someone who just slit their wrists?

270
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,505
I was the victim!

271
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,044
I think she should have put her hands
in a bucket of water

272
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,078
That would finish her off quicker

273
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,442
Did you date her?

274
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,547
Of course not

275
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,778
Well, I gave her a ride in the truck
because she wanted to

276
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,817
I thought it might keep her quiet

277
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:37,690
But it made her worse, and she got
my phone number and address

278
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,355
After that she never stopped calling

279
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,832
I was furious so I called her old man

280
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:50,873
And he says 'I'm so sorry, you can
punch her lights out if it'll help"

281
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,705
But if I did that I'd get thrown in jail

282
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:54,903
Did you hit her?

283
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:55,774
Certainly did

284
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,505
With your fist

285
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,376
How else?

286
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,105
Where?

287
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,375
At her house

288
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:02,111
If you hate her why'd you go there?

289
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:05,044
Watch where you're going, asshole

290
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:21,028
With a travelling companion
The world smiles upon you

291
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,107
Mount Akagi...

292
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,576
Is this Route 17?

293
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,112
No, 353

294
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,311
Even at night Maebashi gets jammed
because of the traffic lights

295
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,248
So we'll go over Mt. Akagi
and avoid the crush

296
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,559
Any body listening, over?

297
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:57,424
Big Blue hearing you loud and clear

298
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:03,901
We're heading down 353 to Niigata
How's the snow looking?

299
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,537
Roads are iced over at Numata

300
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,576
Radio?

301
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:13,207
Yeah, I want to check the best route

302
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,778
This is Northland from Hokkaido

303
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,648
That's unusual

304
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:19,885
What?

305
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:25,155
It's hard to pick up signals from so far
when the weather's like this

306
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,232
Summertime is clearer because the
signals bounce off the ionosphere

307
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,139
It's amazing

308
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,247
They're so far, and yet right here,
entering our perception

309
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,655
If the signal's strong it sounds
even closer

310
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:59,289
And in a good location normal signals
can travel miles

311
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,561
I said "perception" but
he heard 'reception"

312
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,564
And if y ou ask "Who's out there? '

313
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,737
You get replies like 'Tokyo Buddy"
or "Off-Roader here" all at once

314
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,275
What's 'A offroder?"

315
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,541
Oh! "Off-Roader"

316
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,781
You can choose the strongest signal

317
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:23,080
So someone says ' Go ahead, Tokyo"
but there are loads of people

318
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,954
And you get a bunch of replies again
So you pick out the strongest signal

319
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:36,130
Hey! Narita Sightseer here

320
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,559
Good evening to you, Narita Sightseer
He's a radio buddy, another driver

321
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,330
Why "Narita Sightseer"?

322
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,839
It's his handle, a radio nick name

323
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:45,804
But he's a truck driver

324
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,807
Yep

325
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:52,211
Northbound on Route 17
Can you hear me, Minakami, over?

326
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,511
Merit 5 southbound on Rout e 17, over

327
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,588
But why does he use that handle?

328
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,658
Most peop e use illegal wavelengths
so they can't use their real name

329
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,123
Illegal?

330
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,884
Up to 0.5 watts is legal

331
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,294
Anything else is illegal
I use 2 kilo watts!

332
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,922
0.5 watts?

333
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:15,562
Like a walkie-talkie, and very weak
Most people use a booster system

334
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,308
What other kinds of radio are there?

335
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:21,974
There's Amateur and Personal

336
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,882
Such a lot of snow in Tokyo this year

337
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,848
It snowed again today

338
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,879
Amateur radio is called Ham, right?

339
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,016
Yeah, "CQCQ this is 1212" and so on

340
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,756
My truck's electrics packed up today

341
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,332
The lights, the heater, everythinng
I had to use the expressway

342
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,235
What does CQ mean?

343
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,302
Yeah, but they all start working
the minute you go to get them fixed!

344
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:56,411
Some people say it's short for
"Seek you"

345
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:03,118
Others say it means "Come Quick"
It's the code for finding a buddy

346
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:23,133
I was going to drive the Miitsubishi
but it isn't fixed yet

347
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,969
Mitsubishi?

348
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,633
Yeah, Mitsubish Fuso

349
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:32,811
That happened to me once
The ignition key causes a short

350
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,713
It's one of their weak points

351
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,049
I thought Fuso was
a separate company

352
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,315
No, it's Mitsubishi

353
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,219
Is this truck a Mitsubishi

354
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,484
No, Hino

355
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:47,557
Sightseer, it said there's a big party
near Akagi

356
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,599
Making a rocks lade barrier
You better hurry

357
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,393
A party?

358
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,331
Road construction

359
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,403
So it'll be down to one lane

360
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,471
More than likely

361
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,869
Do you only use the CB?

362
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,272
The CB is fun

363
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,944
In what way?

364
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:08,612
People strugging for a strong signal
It's a bit of a power game

365
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:14,514
Its not the same with Persona
Thats just like talking on the phone

366
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,827
Hey there, this is a rendezvous
with Narita Sightseer

367
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,292
Rendezvous?

368
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,424
Talking with 3 or more people

369
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,699
Who can I hear in the background?

370
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,104
Another channel
It's stronger than this one

371
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:33,210
They're not so close
but the signal's strong

372
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,177
Or we might be blocking them

373
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,442
Damn! I wish I'd brought a porno mag

374
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,675
That guy's a laugh!

375
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,288
There's a lot of stuff like that
Sounds lik e a drunken conversat on

376
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,590
I want to watch you

377
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,958
I don't want to go out for the bathroom

378
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,294
Just a second

379
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,362
Yeah, it's OK

380
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:59,754
It's OK, I was washing the dishes

381
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,807
Look, a boat

382
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,804
It's a Russian ship

383
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,177
Is this a port?

384
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,011
Yeah, I have to drop off the tires

385
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,627
It's still early
Let's get some sleep

386
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,624
My body was willing...

387
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,727
But my heart was holding back

388
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,631
All right then, do it yourself

389
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,971
You're wet enough
Why are you ignoring me?

390
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,714
He noticed

391
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,265
I can feel your asshole squeezing

392
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,246
I've got a lump in my throat

393
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,271
Just like when I throw up my food

394
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,132
It's freezing

395
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,006
When I worked for the Yakuza
I was the boss' assistant

396
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,442
I did all sorts of work for them

397
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,515
Answering the office phone
Checking up on the clubs

398
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,914
My pager would ring
and I'd go to one of the bars

399
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,454
Then I'd squeeze money out of the
drunken cust omers

400
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,181
How did you put the squeeze on them?

401
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,226
First I fooled them into thinking
they just needed to pay us of f

402
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,225
Then I d take their name card
out of their wallet

403
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:14,630
Take a few snapshots of them with
some hostess and demand 100,000!

404
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:20,532
Then next time they're out on the town

405
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,178
We make use of the photos

406
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,476
Threaten them to show the
pictures to other people

407
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,149
"We know where your family lives"

408
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,814
"We're not threatening you"
"500,000 will take care of it"

409
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,152
That s as far as we'd go

410
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,920
When did you leave the Yakuza?

411
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,392
I did it less than 2 years

412
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,827
It doesn t take long for me
to lose interest

413
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:46,395
Then I was a pimp for some call girls

414
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,900
That was boring, and we got caught

415
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,098
What for?

416
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,367
Prostitution

417
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,943
What kind of operation was it?

418
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:58,514
The punter sees a flier in a phone box
and they call us

419
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,180
We ask what kind of girl they want

420
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,581
'OK. Be waiting in the coffee shop'

421
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:10,682
Where we operated the coff ee shop
was the Half Moon

422
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:14,285
"The girl will have blonde hair"
' You'll soon recognize her"

423
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,396
Then they'd meet

424
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,132
Hello
Yes, thank you

425
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:24,501
You like her?
OK, we'll need a cash advance

426
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,108
Remember the time

427
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,403
If she's not back after 2 hours
we'll have to come and get her

428
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,070
We don't want that to happen, do we?

429
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:35,915
It wasn't me who was arrested
It was the person below

430
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:39,215
After that I was asked to run a bar

431
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,450
But I wanted a proper job

432
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,656
You were about 19 then?

433
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,490
You said you worked in a
building contractor's office

434
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,992
That was after leaving school

435
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,103
Maybe earlier
I wasn't at school much

436
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,701
Spent more time in hospital!

437
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,802
Did you never sell drugs?

438
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,567
No never

439
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,768
Did you ever do them?

440
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,210
Maybe once or twice

441
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,972
But they never did much for me

442
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,144
I was out of my tree on glue

443
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,051
Ah, a glue head!

444
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,692
It wasn't that I liked it
Just couldn't give up

445
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,621
At that age I had no money for drugs

446
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:24,626
We'd break into the rubber factory
and steal 2 or 3 drums of thinners

447
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,462
We could sell it for big money

448
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,535
You've done it all!

449
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:32,631
You never know what's interesting
if you don't try it

450
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,739
Mind you, doing glue is a fool's game

451
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,707
But I can say that because I tried it

452
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,874
What else have you done?

453
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,778
What else?

454
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,048
Nothing special

455
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,589
You're not exactly normal

456
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,817
And you?

457
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,654
What?

458
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,523
What did you get up to?

459
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,992
Only drinking and puking up food

460
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,314
Puking?

461
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,686
People who starve themselves
are called anorexic

462
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,086
And people who gorge themselves
are called bulimic

463
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:30,960
I interviewed one girl and she
described herself as "bulimorexic"

464
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:35,203
She would stuff herself and then puke

465
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:40,142
A combination of the two conditions

466
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,212
So I asked her why she did it

467
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,377
I suppose I have no self-confidence

468
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,488
I have a lot of stress and instability

469
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,386
That's why I overeat

470
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:01,161
But I don't want to gain weight
and be called fat

471
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,024
So I started making myself sick

472
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:11,599
I started thinking that if I vomited
it wou d be OK in the morning

473
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,703
I was so relieved
I slept like a baby

474
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,039
But I was fooling myself

475
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,877
I started drinking to help me sleep

476
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,251
That made me gain weight

477
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,822
So I started making myself sick

478
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,696
It was awful at first

479
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:38,099
But I really slept wel that night

480
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,566
You were insomniac?

481
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:45,632
The voice inside my head disturbs me

482
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,705
There are three advantages

483
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:56,409
You eat and it tastes good, then puke
You'll be slim and sleep well

484
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,353
It became a sort of hobby

485
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,322
You're strange

486
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,454
But I haven't puked since yesterday

487
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,475
Please wait at the Half Moon

488
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:26,446
You'll recognize the girl
She has bright red hair

489
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:31,916
So they meet
You like her? Great!

490
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,713
We'll need a cash advance

491
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,405
Excuse me, sir

492
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:54,666
I told you we'd come looking
if she didn't come back

493
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,715
You won't believe what he did

494
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,210
Oh yeah?

495
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,187
What exactly did you do to my girl?

496
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:08,552
We're not running an S&M club

497
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:13,126
What do you mean
It was hard for me too

498
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,222
She was saying "More, more!"
But you'd know about that

499
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,196
Give me the key to the handcuffs

500
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,146
This isn't violence

501
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,813
I have every right to do this

502
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,847
You didn't treat her nicely

503
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,682
You didn't keep your promise

504
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,320
You understand?

505
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,732
Fucking bastard

506
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,896
Do you want to go for desert?

507
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,878
I'm thinking of giving up the CB

508
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,108
Why?

509
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:12,912
I was asked to become
a local Club Leader

510
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,149
I've been doing it for years
and I have a lot of contacts

511
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,451
So why not do it?

512
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,756
The organizers are all Yakuza
It's such a pain

513
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,124
Can I have a smoke?

514
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,868
They like to all get together

515
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,060
Parties at hot springs

516
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,705
I can't be bothered

517
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,010
They ask "How's things in
your neck of the woods?"

518
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:39,512
Who cares? They think
they're in ' The Godfather'

519
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,343
If I did go I would borrow a truck

520
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,216
But they'd all be in Mercedes

521
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,483
Dressed in tasteless suits

522
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,116
"You look a bit out of place
What do you drive?"

523
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,253
' Actually, a truck"
"Oh! A trucker?"

524
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,798
I can't stand them
Let's buy a drink

525
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:03,731
In the summer they go to the beach

526
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:09,769
And the Club Leaders go round
letting people have a go on the CB

527
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:12,006
Why do the Yakuza get involved?

528
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:17,352
It's the competition for the airwaves

529
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,149
There's power struggles even with CB

530
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,853
There are all these fractions
And the strongest wins

531
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:27,929
The Yakuza like a finger in every pie
They're like leeches

532
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,846
Are they people not in the club?

533
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:49,213
Not for CB
You have to be a member

534
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:52,420
And everyone is in a different channel

535
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:56,615
People are friendly in my club
That's channel 15

536
00:59:56,859 --> 01:00:00,022
Some channels, lik e channel 6,
have a kind of inner circle

537
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,859
Lots of hardcore members

538
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,291
Some people shoot up on the air

539
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,959
Their handles are strange too
"Nick the Needle" and stuff

540
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,361
Can you hear the police?

541
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,007
No

542
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:15,633
When I was in a bike gang we
stole one from a police car

543
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,178
That and a flashing light
We sold them to a Nationalist group

544
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,773
Hotplate check ahead

545
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,815
Thank s for the report
I'll make a detour

546
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,317
Hotplate check?

547
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,755
Weigh bridge checkpoint

548
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,588
This is a 4 ton truck but I m carrying 6

549
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,706
A report" means a checkpoint
We have to use code words

550
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:54,476
A speed trap is "S meter', a patrol car
sa 'panda", stuff like that

551
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,379
I see

552
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,746
Do you want to try?

553
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:00,784
Pretend you're me

554
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,052
How?

555
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,953
Use this and no one will know

556
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,190
What s this?

557
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,626
A voice converter

558
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,230
I don't really like them

559
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:10,992
It' s on permanent loan

560
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,301
Switch on and put together with the mike

561
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,602
But if they don't know who its
they'll be worried

562
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:23,477
They'll know by my handle
They'll think I'm fooling around

563
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,506
What's your handle?

564
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:29,914
"Storm"
Go ahead

565
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:36,648
This is Storm

566
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,530
I feel like I' ve disappeared

567
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,065
Hows it going?

568
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,112
Sorry, can't hear you!

569
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,183
He was still talking

570
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,345
Breaker, breaker

571
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,589
Can you hear a really faint signal?

572
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,327
What?

573
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,334
Can't you hear it?

574
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,999
Sorry, I can't

575
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:30,203
I've found a great bar
Anyone want to go?

576
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,181
Let's meet at the truck stop

577
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,512
Hawaii, Hawaiii

578
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,713
That girl was a bitch all right

579
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,381
I want to do it with your wife

580
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,117
What time?

581
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,491
I don't rennt out, you know

582
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,292
Tango alpha, queen, queen

583
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,424
11 o'clock? Oh God!

584
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,429
Are you on the expressway?

585
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,132
What time?

586
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,241
Now let's hear some e-mail messages
from our listeners

587
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,742
Did you turn the radio on?

588
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:05,881
Nope

589
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,912
Can I put it on?

590
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,947
If you want
The reception m ght be bad

591
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:24,256
With the CB there are pauses
I'm tired of waiting

592
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:28,237
I can hear my own voice

593
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,933
Mixed with the voice converter

594
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:36,911
Can I put FM on?

595
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,375
Yes. But a CD is be tter

596
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:40,379
No

597
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:45,048
It's the first time I've experiennced
love at first sight

598
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:48,486
But it was the same for mom and dad

599
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:54,291
And then we have the famous
Tennessee Waltz...

600
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,560
Is it raining?

601
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,162
A song

602
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,638
Let's see who our guests are next time

603
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,377
Next week we have a photographer

604
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,242
Annd the week after an actress

605
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:17,085
It's the first time to invite an actress

606
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,189
I look forward to seeing them here

607
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:24,623
There'll also be Miho
We were at a concert together...

608
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,928
There it is!

609
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,430
The voice I heard before

610
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,627
Did I hear the radio even though
it wasn't turned on?

611
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,476
Let's get changed
It's gym class next

612
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,471
Put your arms in the sleeves

613
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,880
Now stretch

614
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,855
God, it's so annoying

615
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:01,687
Yoshi can't think much of Kannako
if he's two-timing her

616
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,932
I think it's Ukai from basketball club

617
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,171
All of that part equals "x"

618
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,376
That girl really annoys me

619
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,735
Should we send her to Coventry?

620
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,878
Yeah.

621
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:25,881
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

622
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:28,914
I'm going to puke

623
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:30,790
What?

624
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,329
Be sick
I feel bad

625
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:45,368
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

626
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,000
Why aren't you going to school?

627
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,205
I want to see a shrinnk

628
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,043
If you hate the school you can
move to another one

629
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,907
Maybe it's not the best idea

630
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,746
People would talk

631
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,654
You could stay with Grandpa

632
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,191
Why did I move to the country?

633
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,324
It's for your own good

634
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,793
What's more important,
your daughter or school?

635
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,493
What are you tryinng to protect?

636
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,172
I'm going to throw up

637
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,161
I feel awful

638
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,664
Hold on

639
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,336
When people rush to my rescue
at the drop of a hat I feel...

640
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,702
...so happy

641
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,833
It's the omnipotence of a child

642
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:59,044
What am I doing?
I'm 31 years old

643
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,488
I'm going to be sick

644
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,554
Listen, I'm not f eeling so good
so I'm signing off

645
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,262
Why did you do that?

646
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:17,960
To cut transmission

647
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,065
By whistling?

648
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,629
There are a lot of methods
It stops others from worrying

649
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,162
Are you OK?

650
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,767
Don't touch me!

651
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,539
Can't throw up. How come?

652
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,645
I feel like shit

653
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,220
I feel hypersensitive

654
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,846
So don't touch me

655
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,880
Please

656
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:19,824
I feel like shit

657
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,750
Stop it

658
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,747
I feel like shit

659
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:13,799
It's ready

660
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,685
Is it too cold?

661
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,525
Just right

662
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:29,104
I've got sensitive skin now
I can't stand hot water

663
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,221
I wonder...

664
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,223
Why this man...

665
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,248
Understands me

666
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,830
His kindness isn't just sympathy
It's the real thing

667
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,758
He's even kind when he doesn't
feel sympathetic

668
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,762
He touches soft things with care

669
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,701
Like you would handle a peach

670
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:06,113
Cold shoulders
We're like animals

671
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,839
Acting on instinct

672
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,344
Some people don't know how to
handle something softly

673
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,988
He's so nice

674
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:18,159
If I stayed with him he'd be mine

675
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:21,158
If I fall in love I'll cry

676
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,198
Don't be stupid
Who cares about his wife

677
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:26,963
I like him

678
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:33,307
Just let me drown

679
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,301
What are y ou doing?

680
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,377
Drown

681
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,509
Hit me

682
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:43,310
Why?

683
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,352
So I know how the stalker felt

684
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,490
I lust after the hand that smites!

685
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:53,724
I can't hit you
I can't hit someone I like

686
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,094
I have no idea...

687
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,034
...what you're talking about

688
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:05,632
Mother

689
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:22,277
I'll never understand you

690
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,153
You're quiet

691
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,393
Are you tired?

692
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,964
It's so bright

693
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,812
That pachinko parlour's closed down

694
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,854
Old men having their morning coffee

695
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:47,729
Jesus! Watch where you're walking

696
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,448
That was a bit of a shock

697
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,952
You should eat

698
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:53,327
You wouldn't want me to be sick again

699
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:58,664
As long as you're not sick in the truck

700
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,177
If you don't eat,
there's nothing to puke up

701
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:34,726
You're saying things like
"It's bright" or "This is route 5"

702
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,462
Looking at the people and saying

703
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,144
"The old men having morning coffee"

704
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:45,912
I know

705
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:57,486
You'd say those things even if
I wasn't in the truck

706
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,761
I suppose so

707
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,768
So I don't have to answer every time

708
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:11,670
No

709
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,859
You said you liked me

710
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:38,790
Yes, I like y ou

711
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,509
How about you?

712
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,756
Do you like me?

713
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,831
Yes, I do

714
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:22,632
You can stay with me if you want

715
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:27,973
Thanks

716
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:34,915
But there's a man waiting
in my apartment

717
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,024
I told him I was just going to buy wine

718
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,222
You're joking

719
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:48,558
He's been waiting all this time?

720
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:51,570
Yep

721
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,309
Wow, what a man

722
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,382
Well, I met you

723
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:23,561
I'm kidding
There's no man

724
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,135
You re the same, right?

725
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,240
You're not married, are you?

726
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:33,903
No

727
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:43,222
No wife, no kid, no stalker

728
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,622
I thought so

729
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,233
It's true

730
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,921
Do you want to drive?

731
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:52,415
Me?

732
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,595
You have a license don't you?

733
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,028
Yeah

734
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,131
You can drive a 4 ton with it

735
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,094
Are you sure?

736
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:02,597
Of course

737
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:05,339
I don't think so

738
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:08,874
Yes you can
You'll be OK

739
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:10,807
I'll keep an eye on you

740
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:25,150
You can start n second on the fat

741
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:30,820
It's got a lot of torque so second's OK

742
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,866
Give it some throttle
A bit more

743
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:37,801
Let in the clutch and shift up
And again

744
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:41,142
Throttle

745
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:45,877
Take that exit

746
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:57,649
Thats it, turn

747
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,588
We're OK, straight out

748
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:44,371
The landscape peels away before us
Our skin is chafed

749
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:21,840
Shall we pull in there?

750
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:31,685
Remember the position of the wheels
as you turn

751
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,488
A bit more, and more
Left hand winker

752
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:47,028
That's the exhaust brake
The winker is on the right

753
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,095
Start turning right now

754
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:54,298
A bit more right

755
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,806
Just do as I say

756
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:59,075
A bit more right
Then sharp left

757
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,377
Left, and down a gear
Bit of brake

758
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:10,255
Hard to the left

759
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,953
Don't touch the gears
Don't touch the throttle

760
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,489
And straight en the wheel

761
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,905
That was fucking brilliant!

762
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,939
Shall I drive us back?

763
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:04,976
The voices in my head have gone

764
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:07,982
I suppose they'll be back

765
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:11,008
But for now they're gone

766
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:07,166
He was good enough to eat
But he ended up consuming me

767
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:10,193
That was all

768
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,173
But...

769
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,303
I felt as if I'd turned into
something good

770
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:29,049
You say you want
to become something

771
01:30:48,376 --> 01:31:02,017
I still love you even if you're no one

772
01:31:26,214 --> 01:31:41,118
I say this to you
I who am no one

773
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:02,709
Shinobu TERAJIMA as Rei

Nao OHMORI as Takatoshi

Tomorrow TAGUCHI as Policeman

776
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:26,836
You say that
something is missing

777
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:36,876
Though your body is
bathed in light
