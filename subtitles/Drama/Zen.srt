1
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,154
What have they!
What have they done!

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,155
Please, stop!

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,253
Please, stop!

4
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:18,495
Shut up!

5
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,895
Good enough!
Let's go

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,665
A heretical sect destroyed!

7
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,038
You reap what you sow!

8
00:00:29,743 --> 00:00:31,802
Water! Get water!

9
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:38,943
Driven out of Kennin Temple,

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,852
and now driven out of here
with our aims half fulfilled,

11
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,854
I am sick with disappointment

12
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:50,423
I am heartbroken

13
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:52,822
Nevertheless...

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,858
we cannot allow the true light
of Buddhism to be put out

15
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:01,402
Fellow monks, we will depart

16
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,735
for Echizen, in order
to lay the foundation

17
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:07,810
for true Buddhism

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,542
Who are you?

19
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,481
Gikai, you made it

20
00:01:56,463 --> 00:02:01,332
Master Dogen... I, Gikai of
the Dharma sect and the others...

21
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:04,569
have raced here to ask
your permission to join you

22
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:20,486
Let us proceed

23
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:20,305
The heavenly way

24
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:23,582
is lofty and serene

25
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,786
The earthly way...

26
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:30,418
solid and still

27
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,052
The human way

28
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,120
is calm and tranquil

29
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,458
Throughout the universe

30
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,403
there is unending peace

31
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:42,422
The person who helped to clear
my way towards enlightenment

32
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:45,419
was an elderly Kitchen Master

33
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:50,523
The position of Kitchen Master has always
been entrusted only to monks

34
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,691
whose hearts are committed
to seeking the Way

35
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:56,032
This is because

36
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:58,537
the practice of Kitchen Master

37
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,474
requires a single-minded purity
permitting no idle thoughts

38
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:08,941
"I owe my knowledge of teachings
and my understanding of practice

39
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:10,684
"entirely to that Kitchen Master"

40
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,986
Kitchen Master Instructions
"entirely to that Kitchen Master"

41
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:13,975
Kitchen Master Instructions

42
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,470
How is it?

43
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:41,377
Have you grown used to
the work of Kitchen Master?

44
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,311
I do my best

45
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,511
That's good

46
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,187
Gikai sama, may I
ask you a question?

47
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,158
What is it?

48
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,201
I understand it logically, but...

49
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:11,336
I am not able to sit Zazen
the way everyone else can

50
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:19,084
I cannot help but panic at
the thought of being left behind

51
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:23,553
Then you should sit
while everyone else sleeps

52
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,428
You are here... Orin

53
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,599
Yes

54
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,573
Master Dogen,

55
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:02,279
please allow me to become
a nun here

56
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:12,131
I cannot

57
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:19,133
Is that because I am a sinful

58
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,733
and disgraced woman?

59
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,769
- We do not question past acts
- Why not, then?

60
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,779
First you must abandon
your attachment to the past

61
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:30,539
When you are free
of your attachments,

62
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,114
though you may be
in the secular world,

63
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:37,182
you shall be pure

64
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,656
Return to Kyoto and do your best

65
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,123
I will not return

66
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:58,703
Gikai sama

67
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,249
We have no rice to cook

68
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,447
Nor millet left

69
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:14,390
If there is not enough rice,

70
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,223
then make porridge

71
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,731
It is not enough for porridge

72
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Then make rice broth

73
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:26,799
It is not enough for rice broth

74
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,899
In that case,

75
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:34,806
we shall drink boiled water
and sit Zazen

76
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,319
Completely disengage from
normal life

77
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,351
and abandon everything
you had been engaged with

78
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,954
Abandon thinking about
right and wrong...

79
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,657
and of thinking itself, along with
thoughts of enlightenment

80
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:57,700
Abandon all intentions
and thoughts

81
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:00,168
This is known as
Without Thinking

82
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,167
We do not sit Zazen for
the purpose of enlightenment

83
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,374
Just sitting in meditation

84
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,379
That itself is enlightenment

85
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:23,787
Shunryo sama

86
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,662
Orin san

87
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,837
When did you arrive?

88
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:33,633
10 days ago

89
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,970
I did not see you

90
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,369
and feared you had moved away

91
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,771
I am responsible
for the cooking,

92
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:45,612
so I cannot sit with everyone else

93
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:52,916
What is wrong?

94
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:57,319
I do not know

95
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:19,576
"Plant the seeds

96
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:25,584
"In the fields and levees

97
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:37,560
"In the fall... there'll be

98
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:43,432
"5 kinds of grains

99
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:53,441
"In the fall... there'll be
five kinds of grains"

100
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,755
Shunryo sama

101
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,900
Orin san

102
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:25,969
What are you doing?

103
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,808
I'm mushroom hunting

104
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:31,315
I can be your guide
I know a good spot

105
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,824
Look, there

106
00:14:58,811 --> 00:14:59,971
Here... too

107
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:02,205
Ouch!

108
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,744
Shunryo sama!

109
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:25,232
It's not a poisonous snake,
you should be fine

110
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:02,907
I am so sorry
I gave in to temptation

111
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,612
If you find me acceptable,

112
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:10,712
I don't mind

113
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,648
Orin san, please forgive me

114
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,151
Now you see the base motives
that brought me into Buddhism

115
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,425
But for me to defile you,
whose motives are so pure...

116
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,233
The fault is mine

117
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,702
I wanted to interact with you
as a normal woman...

118
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:35,501
ignoring my own past

119
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:39,544
And I wanted you to touch me,
not for my female body,

120
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,910
but as a real human being

121
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:45,212
I am the one who tempted you
Forgive me

122
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,560
Shunryo sama!

123
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:02,953
Shunryo, what are you doing!

124
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,395
Shunryo!

125
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,668
Shunryo

126
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:14,301
What is the meaning of this?

127
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:22,848
Zen Master

128
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:29,320
I am horrified to realize
that the demon

129
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:33,354
of lust has settled into my heart

130
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,961
It is unforgivable in
one who seeks the Way

131
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,463
Upon careful consideration,

132
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,399
I have resolved to take a leave

133
00:18:49,776 --> 00:18:53,542
I can no longer
defile this temple

134
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:58,717
and your teachings
with my presence

135
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:07,224
Is the demon still within you?

136
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:12,794
Tell him...

137
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:17,395
It's gone

138
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,600
Are you...

139
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:30,815
Are you sure
that is your decision?

140
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:33,980
Yes

141
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,780
Master

142
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,872
It is time to sit

143
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,901
Everyone take your places

144
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:41,646
Shunryo!

145
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,253
The gates of this temple...

146
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:56,026
Are always open for you

147
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,884
Shunryo sama, don't go!

148
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,116
Don't come near me

149
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,895
I love you!

150
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:12,607
Sir Hatano...
you are most welcome

151
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,815
Please forgive my rudeness

152
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,885
arriving so early in the morning

153
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:24,684
and interrupting your
Zen meditation

154
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:28,088
No, no, for you... Sir Hatano,

155
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:31,459
you are welcome
at any hour of any day

156
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:34,929
I can never possibly repay
the great debt

157
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,730
I owe you for donating this Zendo

158
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:44,132
I remain constantly
grateful to you

159
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:49,648
It is I who am grateful

160
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,813
I trust your arrival here...

161
00:22:55,388 --> 00:23:00,553
means Hojo Tokiyori
is in dire peril

162
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:06,729
It is exactly so

163
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:12,994
It was a merciless battle

164
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:18,007
The Hojo and Miura clans
had been closely knit

165
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:21,442
ever since Yoritomo formed
their alliance

166
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,380
But yesterday's friend
is today's foe

167
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:30,421
In the event... samurai must kill
with arrows and with swords

168
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:36,488
It was living hell on earth

169
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,799
You!

170
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,832
Die!

171
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,674
Die!

172
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,249
How dare you defy me...
Tokiyori, even in death!

173
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,153
Damn you!

174
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:13,929
Die! Die!

175
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,744
Damn you!

176
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:28,302
Go away!

177
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,021
How dare you!

178
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:43,761
Master Dogen
please come to Kamakura

179
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,423
Please save the Shogun

180
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:50,730
I beg, I beg of you

181
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:04,538
A dog?

182
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,581
Or a wolf?

183
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:14,957
Ji-uen...

184
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:19,528
let us visit living hell together

185
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:23,702
Yes

186
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:34,872
I am not going

187
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:38,411
to visit the Shogun,
Hojo Tokiyori

188
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:41,983
I am going to visit...

189
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:46,080
a young man
howling in anguish

190
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:51,228
Master,

191
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:56,126
let me join you

192
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:58,166
I cannot

193
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:20,452
I am risking my life

194
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,893
on this journey to Kamakura

195
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:26,559
Ejo,

196
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:30,993
I cannot also place
your life in danger

197
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,896
I entrust

198
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,539
my affairs to you

199
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:22,814
Vast is the robe of liberation

200
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:31,888
A formless field of benefaction

201
00:27:32,298 --> 00:27:38,567
I wear the Buddha's dharma

202
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:47,073
Saving all sentient beings

203
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:03,790
I am Tokiyori

204
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,693
I am Dogen of Eiheiji Temple

205
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:17,796
I've brought you here because
I have something to ask you

206
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,476
What do you wish to ask me?

207
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:25,005
I hear you've returned from China

208
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:28,571
with the true Buddhism
passed down from Buddha

209
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,975
Tell me, what is that?

210
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,016
They are the true, authentic
teachings of Buddha,

211
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:37,523
passed down through

212
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,993
generations of monks,
without interruption

213
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:46,290
But that is the same claim
made by all those other sects

214
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:50,196
No matter how many sutras
you read or chant,

215
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:52,569
or call out Buddha's name...

216
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:56,166
you will not be able to find
Buddha's teachings

217
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,236
What do you do in your sect?

218
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:05,517
Just sitting in meditation
We sit and we sit

219
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:13,390
How can true Buddhism be found...
sitting around doing nothing?

220
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:19,530
Lord Tokiyori, that is akin
to being in the ocean

221
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,004
and claiming to have no water

222
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:24,405
What!

223
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,233
Flowers in spring,

224
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,270
cuckoos in summer,

225
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,073
the moon in autumn

226
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:42,783
and chilly snows in winter

227
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:46,388
Flowers in spring,

228
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:49,660
cuckoos in summer...

229
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:55,792
Dogen... these are most obvious

230
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:57,929
They are indeed obvious

231
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,569
Things as they are

232
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:05,843
Seeing things as they truly are...

233
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,744
That is enlightenment

234
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,516
Zazen is to see the water
in the vast ocean

235
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,985
And yet, until we find
the innate Buddha,

236
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,992
we cannot understand
there is water

237
00:31:19,161 --> 00:31:22,460
in the vast ocean

238
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,463
I don't understand, Dogen

239
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:31,163
What is enlightenment?

240
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,274
What is the innate Buddha?

241
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,912
Fortunately, the moon
is full tonight

242
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,379
Lord Tokiyori,

243
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:53,658
shall we go into the garden
and look at the moon?

244
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,997
The moon?

245
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:07,832
It is magnificent

246
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,241
Pure and undefiled
Perfect and flawless

247
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:18,352
That moon which resides in your
heart is innate Buddha

248
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,915
There is only one moon
in the heavens

249
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,580
I cannot see a moon
in my heart

250
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,790
Furthermore,

251
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,794
that full moon is soon fated
to fade and whither

252
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,229
Lord Tokiyori

253
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,170
Please look

254
00:32:44,346 --> 00:32:45,870
Lord Tokiyori

255
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,913
Can you cut down this moon?

256
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,547
Easily

257
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,945
I have cut it down

258
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,377
Is that so?

259
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:25,315
Have another look

260
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:43,937
Though clouds should
obscure the moon...

261
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:48,134
or the moon disappear
from the heavens

262
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:51,339
we cannot say there is no moon

263
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,073
The moon cannot be wet
and water cannot be torn

264
00:33:57,152 --> 00:34:00,713
The moon is innate Buddha...
and water is the self

265
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:05,589
This incomprehensible dialogue
does not quell my anguish

266
00:34:09,898 --> 00:34:11,593
Damn you

267
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:16,262
You're back again

268
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:20,773
Get away!

269
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,587
Dogen

270
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:43,455
How can I exterminate
these vengeful ghosts

271
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,566
which taunt me nightly?

272
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,205
You cannot exterminate them

273
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:55,065
You must convert them

274
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,300
Convert them?

275
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,345
Conversion means acceptance

276
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,712
The pain, sorrow and hate
those spirits carry,

277
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,152
is precisely your own

278
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:13,317
pain... sorrow and hate

279
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:17,221
You must accept all that anguish

280
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:22,259
However, until you abandon
your entire self

281
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:24,936
you cannot accept that anguish

282
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,841
nor will the anguish fade away

283
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:33,179
The moment you grasped power
in your right hand,

284
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:39,246
your left hand grasped suffering

285
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:45,225
Are you telling me to abandon
my position as Regent of the land?

286
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:50,263
The very definition of a regent is
to hold power instead of a monarch

287
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,932
It is grasping this power

288
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:56,163
that has caused your anguish

289
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,232
Lord Tokiyori,

290
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:05,406
now is the time to release
your grasp

291
00:36:08,883 --> 00:36:13,684
If I abandon the Regency...
there will be civil war

292
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,452
My duty is to maintain

293
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,791
peace throughout the land

294
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,027
Is that not true?

295
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:26,660
No matter how brilliant...

296
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:29,929
no one who has employed weapons
to subjugate his people

297
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:33,335
can rule forever

298
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,606
Certainly,

299
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,977
a ruler who knows no peace
in his own heart,

300
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,846
can hardly rule peacefully

301
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:51,252
Though you

302
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:55,922
fervently wish to be saved...

303
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,426
you don't have the courage
to abandon anything

304
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,268
How dare you... Dogen

305
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,470
I, Tokiyori,

306
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,934
have never been
so insulted in my life!

307
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:13,013
Lord!

308
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,579
Dogen!

309
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:18,318
Are you prepared to die!

310
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:27,117
I always have been

311
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,565
When I came here,
I had already

312
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:35,865
abandoned my body
and my soul

313
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,558
As you wish

314
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:17,722
If you do evil
you will harvest evil

315
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,790
If you do good
you will harvest good

316
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:23,496
When death approaches,

317
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:29,038
neither political power nor those
you love nor vast fortunes,

318
00:40:29,277 --> 00:40:32,337
will be able to save you

319
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:39,880
To death, you must go alone

320
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:44,223
All that will accompany you

321
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,886
is everything you did in life

322
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:49,926
That and nothing else

323
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:17,156
Master Dogen

324
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:22,186
Look at this land

325
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:25,894
Here on this land...

326
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:30,601
I will build a great temple,
second to none

327
00:41:33,374 --> 00:41:35,604
Please stay here in Kamakura,

328
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,835
and become its founding priest

329
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:46,517
It shall become the great
foundation of your Buddhism...

330
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:48,589
I cannot accept

331
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,285
What?

332
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,551
You refuse?

333
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:06,001
My temple

334
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:10,842
is Eiheiji, a very... very
small temple

335
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:13,646
in the Echizen mountains

336
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,726
Master Dogen

337
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:31,097
I am so glad to have met you

338
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,556
Now I must take my leave

339
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,074
"Flowers in spring,

340
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:21,773
"cuckoos in summer...

341
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,710
"the moon in autumn

342
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:29,046
"and chilly snows in winter"

343
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,640
Ejo

344
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:35,715
Yes

345
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:39,155
The monks in the monastery

346
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,295
should be as harmonious
as milk and water

347
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,658
and practice Zen single-mindedly

348
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:50,836
Eventually, each monk will
become a head priest

349
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,264
Monks

350
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,773
are the eternal companions
of Buddhism

351
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,875
Yes

352
00:45:09,223 --> 00:45:10,747
Gikai

353
00:45:15,196 --> 00:45:16,288
Yes

354
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:21,097
You shall be the abbot

355
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:24,363
Assist Ejo

356
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:28,234
and devote yourself
to the 3 minds

357
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,369
The 3 minds are...

358
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:33,771
the joyful mind,

359
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,177
the caring mind

360
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:39,313
and the universal mind

361
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:42,982
Yes

362
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:45,583
Ji-uen

363
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:47,989
Yes

364
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:56,369
Is all well?

365
00:45:58,773 --> 00:46:03,107
Of course, sir

366
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:20,219
Right now, I can see
Tien-tung-shan

367
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:27,326
The only ones who actually saw
Ju-ching practice Zen,

368
00:46:28,669 --> 00:46:30,261
are you

369
00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:35,867
and I, none other

370
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:42,772
You understand my meaning?

371
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:46,651
Yes

372
00:47:00,468 --> 00:47:01,867
Kugyo..

373
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:19,885
You have been a good disciple...

374
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,853
And...

375
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,195
A good friend

376
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:34,364
The words you spoke

377
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,299
to me, your disciple Ji-uen,

378
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:44,505
give me the greatest joy

379
00:47:53,654 --> 00:47:57,351
1st, be free from desire

380
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:00,956
2nd... be satisfied

381
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:04,758
3rd... be tranquil

382
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,725
4th, be diligent

383
00:48:10,204 --> 00:48:12,604
5th... remember the teachings

384
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:16,442
6th, meditate

385
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:20,209
7th... practice wisdom

386
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,980
8th, avoid pointless talk

387
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,960
Each of Buddha's disciples

388
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,770
learned these Eight Means
to Enlightenment

389
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,135
Unless you study these,

390
00:48:50,778 --> 00:48:53,144
you are not a Buddhist disciple

391
00:48:54,615 --> 00:48:56,742
You must not be negligent,

392
00:48:57,751 --> 00:49:00,117
even for a moment

393
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:50,693
Ejo

394
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:53,837
Yes

395
00:49:57,678 --> 00:50:02,513
Let Orin take Buddhist orders

396
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,912
Yes

397
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:20,957
Zazen

398
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:23,294
In the time of life...

399
00:51:25,466 --> 00:51:28,765
there is none other than life

400
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,465
In the time of death,

401
00:51:33,941 --> 00:51:38,378
there is none other than death

402
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,125
Master...

403
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:23,946
Continue

404
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:27,393
to sit!

405
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:12,566
Dogen enters Nirvana... 1253

406
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:17,892
What a surprise

407
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,559
To get alms from a monk

408
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:25,538
Tell me... do monks
make a good living?

409
00:55:41,388 --> 00:55:45,256
What the hell is this?

410
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:15,116
To study the Buddha Way

411
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:17,717
is to study the self

412
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:20,993
To study the self

413
00:56:22,396 --> 00:56:24,830
is to forget the self

414
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,401
To forget the self

415
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:32,803
is to be enlightened by everything

416
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:37,304
To be enlightened by everything

417
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:41,641
is to free your own

418
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:44,448
body and mind

419
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:48,087
and the body and mind of others

420
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:11,005
You hold Buddha in your hands

421
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:15,180
Buddha lives in your hands

422
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:20,578
So let us hold him close
and protect him

423
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:23,922
Is the Buddha in my hands?

424
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,087
That is right

425
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,800
Subtitles: Arigon

426
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,666
Hold your hands,
not like that,

427
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,142
but like this

428
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,979
Because it's raining...
