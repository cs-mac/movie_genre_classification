1
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:30,918
<i>When I was four,</i>

2
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:34,182
<i>I cried because my teacher</i>
<i>called me a bad boy.</i>

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,622
<i>My parents comforted me.</i>

4
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:42,624
<i>They told me things aren't always</i>
<i>clear-cut in life.</i>

5
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,927
<i>They aren't black or white.</i>

6
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,702
<i>And people aren't good or evil.</i>

7
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:49,938
<i>People change, that's all.</i>

8
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:53,771
<i>I cried even more.</i>

9
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:55,707
<i>The idea of changing terrified me.</i>

10
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,547
"Big black beast
Take me with you"

11
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:07,454
"I'm not jerking"

12
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:08,886
"I won't hide"

13
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:12,120
"Yeah, I'm ready
Meet ze monsta tonight"

14
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:14,565
"Big black beast
Take me with you"

15
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,658
"What a monster
What a night"

16
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,802
"What a lover
What a fight"

17
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,030
<i>Three months ago, I felt younger.</i>

18
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:25,403
<i>I found life easier</i>

19
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:28,044
<i>and enjoyed doing loads of things.</i>

20
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,538
<i>At school, I studied French novelists,</i>

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,809
<i>English poets, mathematical formulae,</i>
<i>physics</i>

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,543
<i>and irregular verbs.</i>

23
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,386
<i>Changing subjects hourly</i>
<i>didn’t bother me.</i>

24
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:44,354
<i>I didn’t even realize</i>
<i>they were subjects.</i>

25
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,429
<i>What has changed?</i>

26
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,096
<i>How have I changed?</i>

27
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,435
<i>I've become stupid and selfish.</i>

28
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,073
<i>And less self-confident too.</i>

29
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:46,419
COLD SHOWERS

30
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,154
Here...

31
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,967
Mom!

32
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,746
Stop shouting.
You'll wake your father.

33
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,677
- The water-heater's off.
- I know.

34
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,010
I turned it off.

35
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,879
To save money.

36
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,920
Look...

37
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:27,854
Our standing account

38
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:31,494
is for a yearly consumption
of 6,000 kilowatt-hours.

39
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,864
- Know how much we use?
- Mom...

40
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,031
I can't take a cold shower.

41
00:04:37,635 --> 00:04:41,162
Let's leave the lights off instead.

42
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,508
What's that?

43
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,176
Cold chocolate.

44
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:48,368
I'm not drinking it cold!

45
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,347
You loved it cold as a boy.

46
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,950
You get crazy sometimes...

47
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:57,517
I bet Dad won't agree.

48
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,783
He can keep quiet,
seeing how late he came in.

49
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:06,523
But the fridge will defrost.

50
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,760
I forgot about that!

51
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,901
Three pizzas left...

52
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,211
All right, "big" is...

53
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,579
as big as her love for him
or his love for her.

54
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,916
“Black” is...

55
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,654
It's the lovers' dark night, say.

56
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:36,089
The night is black.

57
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,995
“Beast” refers to his way
of making love.

58
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:44,125
And we have a parallel
between "bestial” and "monster".

59
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,599
Then we have "what a fight".

60
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:50,335
This poem views love as a fight.

61
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,839
A boxing bout or a judo match...

62
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,379
“It's coming. "

63
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,441
That's good too because...

64
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,785
"Yes, it's coming".

65
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,621
He or she is coming.

66
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,153
The beast

67
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,360
or the climax... “It's coming. "

68
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:13,829
We can analyze the poem
from a sexual angle each time,

69
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,795
"to come" meaning "to climax".

70
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:18,634
Vanessa...

71
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:24,606
I'm not opposed
to a carnal analysis of the poem.

72
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,040
Just don't take it too far, okay?

73
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:28,612
Okay.

74
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:31,610
We'll stop there.

75
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,216
All right, fine.

76
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:35,818
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

77
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,218
You can put this poem
on your exam list.

78
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:43,656
Can you pass this to Vanessa?

79
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:47,560
Don't turn round.

80
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,644
Grip, take two steps back,

81
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,643
pull, throw, next...

82
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,412
Go on, grip, step back, throw, next!

83
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,359
Come on, throw!

84
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,021
It's getting tougher, only natural.

85
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:21,596
That's good. Go and get them.
Wipe the floor with them!

86
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,599
I did <i>yoko tomoe</i> twice on Tranh.

87
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,738
Once! The thigh doesn't count.

88
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:35,674
What's <i>yoko tomoe</i>?

89
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,371
You know that throw?

90
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,550
Mickael!

91
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,353
- Can you come here?
- Go on, I've got it.

92
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,716
Louis Steiner is here. Heard of him?

93
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,485
- Not at all.
- Steiner Transport. The blue trucks.

94
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:50,854
Okay, I see.

95
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:52,361
Mr. Steiner...

96
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,390
Mickael, the team captain.

97
00:07:58,337 --> 00:08:00,202
Not very hefty for a captain.

98
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,366
Don't go by appearances.
He has great technique. He's fast.

99
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:07,273
Just kidding.
I've seen you fight before.

100
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,713
Are you interested in judo?

101
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:12,975
I'm a businessman
so popular sports interest me.

102
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,618
And judo's the only popular one here.

103
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,954
He knows judo well.
His son's a black belt.

104
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,285
He's in the same category as you.

105
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,755
He's joined the club. He's not bad.

106
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,625
I want him to second you.

107
00:08:26,832 --> 00:08:29,494
It'll be good for you.
A new partner

108
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,162
and a good change.

109
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,168
Can you run with him Saturday?

110
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,003
Sure, if you want.

111
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,903
You don't have to become
bosom buddies...

112
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:40,773
No, I don't mind.

113
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,642
Mr. Steiner has moved to Blue Valley.

114
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,182
You can run around the lake there.

115
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,317
When do you run?

116
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,315
Around 10.

117
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:52,490
Here...

118
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,459
Thank you.

119
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,289
Know where it is?

120
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,827
It's simple...

121
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,358
There's a roundabout
at the entrance to Blue Valley.

122
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,136
As for the house,

123
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:08,036
it has a marquee over the door.

124
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:09,865
What's a marquee?

125
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,506
It's like

126
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,368
a small glass canopy.

127
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:14,872
You'll see,

128
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,080
my son's not as good as you
but he can progress.

129
00:11:13,266 --> 00:11:14,563
Guillaume, my cousin...

130
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:15,995
You know he does karate?

131
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,294
No.

132
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:20,005
He says karatekas
are tougher than judokas.

133
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:23,301
Bullshit.
Judo and karate are different.

134
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,805
But if a judoka fights a karateka,
who wins?

135
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:30,779
If a footballer
plays a basketball player, who wins?

136
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,250
But what if they fight on the street?

137
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:40,652
It won't happen. Judokas and karatekas
don't fight on the street.

138
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:46,127
Well, my cousin fights everybody.

139
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,262
- Maybe he's a jerk. Which cousin?
- Guillaume.

140
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:51,663
The skinny blond guy

141
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,202
who danced like this?

142
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:57,142
That guy can't beat a judoka.

143
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,655
- Hi, how's it going?
- Good, and you?

144
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,347
So that's the marquee?

145
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,527
- Come in.
- With my bike?

146
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:50,821
No, leave it, it's safe here.

147
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,614
- Give me that!
- You're in shape...

148
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:18,281
Clement, ask Mrs. Farinha
to tidy up, please.

149
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,960
We just moved in, it's a mess.

150
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,692
Plus he keeps fucking about.

151
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,131
It's okay...

152
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,306
Want a drink? A bite to eat?

153
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:35,873
Not before a run.

154
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,774
You know, we ought to get going.

155
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,379
It starts getting hot around 11.

156
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,380
You plan to run for long?

157
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,550
An hour or so.

158
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:50,650
I'll just get my running shoes.

159
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:09,833
Clement, I don't believe it...

160
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,342
I'll see to it later.

161
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:14,342
Look after Theo instead.

162
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,649
When do you finish?

163
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,146
At 11.

164
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:21,287
You'll get exploited here.
Watch her, she's a cow.

165
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,321
Mrs. Farinha is going on strike.

166
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,626
- She wants overtime pay.
- Sure.

167
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,265
Hello.

168
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,806
Running in those?

169
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,878
Keep a pair for running
or you'll wreck your back.

170
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:49,711
They're too tight.

171
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:56,054
When you run, your feet start swelling
after 10 minutes.

172
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,221
They need to be loose.

173
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:03,287
Let me.

174
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,529
Remove the foil around the neck.

175
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:18,673
If you just cut the foil,

176
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:19,903
when you pour,

177
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,512
the wine can get spoiled.

178
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,350
You've learned a lot here.

179
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,352
I hope we aren't too "preachy".

180
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,315
No, not at all.

181
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,957
- We've fought four times?
- Yes.

182
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,727
You're my arch-rival.

183
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,957
Oh, right... I didn't know.

184
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,460
It doesn't count in the juniors.

185
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,967
Do you have an arch-rival?

186
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,703
I can't say I don't have one.

187
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,810
That'd be too big-headed.

188
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:28,982
I guess...

189
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,751
You know Beltrani?

190
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,613
Yeah, an Italian.

191
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,312
Yeah, that's him.

192
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,050
That guy...

193
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,050
He has this left guard...

194
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,788
You're there...

195
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:44,254
You can't grab his sleeve.

196
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:45,054
Stop it, miss, please!

197
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,229
Cut it out, guys!

198
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:50,994
Passports, please.

199
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:53,639
Under 66 kilos.

200
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:55,308
N Goc Tranh.

201
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,235
You don't pronounce the “N".

202
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:03,073
It's not 66 kilos, Mr. Gnoc,
it's less than 66 kilos.

203
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,511
Strip.

204
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:06,949
I like that!

205
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:16,029
Calm down, lads.

206
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:19,094
Under 73: Percepied, Mickael.

207
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:23,694
All right.

208
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:28,769
Under 81: Colignon, Xavier.

209
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:31,939
All right.

210
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:37,142
Under 90: Hermann, Arnaud.

211
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:39,182
- It's Heymann.
- Heymann. Sorry.

212
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:40,546
Hey, man!

213
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,879
All right.

214
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,484
Over 90: Kheroubi, Bruno.

215
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:48,888
That's right.

216
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:51,624
Normally, you should...

217
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,062
It's okay. I have a bit of leeway.

218
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:55,364
All right.

219
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:58,963
The substitutes...

220
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,529
Sanchez, Jeff.

221
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,203
He's here.

222
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:06,340
Under 73 kilos: Clement Steiner.

223
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:16,887
- Coach, can I have one, please?
- Calm down.

224
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,888
First heat against Poitiers.

225
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:20,758
Get into it right away.

226
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,328
They're at home, strong all-rounders.

227
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,089
Mickael, you're against Beltrani.
Make it a tie.

228
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,269
Warm up with your substitute.

229
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:32,563
Clement, make him work on the left.
Let's go!

230
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:35,373
Tackle me on my left.

231
00:18:35,877 --> 00:18:36,740
Dodge,

232
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:39,103
grip and strike home.

233
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,574
Block the shoulder, okay.
That way works too.

234
00:18:42,784 --> 00:18:44,876
See? You get the upper hand.

235
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,283
Okay?

236
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,085
Then what?

237
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,586
You're useless tactically.
Again.

238
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:51,918
What did you say?

239
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,854
Come on, attack me.

240
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:00,967
Like that. Grab,

241
00:19:01,636 --> 00:19:03,569
approach, block

242
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,368
and throw yourself into it.

243
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:07,934
That's <i>sumi geishi</i>!

244
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,574
- <i>Sumi geishi</i>?
- Yeah.

245
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:17,310
Stingy bastard!

246
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:50,575
<i>Next bout: Percepied - Beltrani.</i>
<i>Percepied, white belt.</i>

247
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,480
Go, Mickael!

248
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,189
Okay, get into it. Don't waste time.

249
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,695
Get into position first!

250
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:12,831
Break his grip!

251
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,171
Watch your legs!

252
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,650
<i>Ko uchil</i>
That's looking good!

253
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,030
Carry on!

254
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:38,994
His left, Mickael. Watch his left!

255
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:44,027
What the hell...
<i>Shido</i> for that!

256
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:04,524
Don't lose the sleeve!

257
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,203
It's Steiner.

258
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,038
Hello, Mr. Steiner.

259
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,834
<i>Mickael? Bravo.</i>

260
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,909
<i>Tell the team I'm proud of you.</i>

261
00:21:25,113 --> 00:21:28,605
<i>And proud to sponsor you</i>
<i>for the European Cup.</i>

262
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:30,875
<i>- It suits me, believe me.</i>
- Us too.

263
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,211
Is the water hot?

264
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,447
<i>You'll get new tracksuits</i>
<i>Tuesday or Wednesday.</i>

265
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:38,221
<i>- You'll all need to check the sizes.</i>
- Okay.

266
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:40,686
New tracksuits Tuesday, lads!

267
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:44,693
<i>I hear you wasted Beltrani today.</i>

268
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:48,125
<i>- Carry on like that.</i>
- Thank you.

269
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,570
Goodbye.

270
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:53,467
Tranh, my boy. Finished washing?

271
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,033
Wicked...

272
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,427
Who did this?

273
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:19,761
- It wasn't me!
- Outta the way.

274
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,265
Screw you! My soap's red. Look...

275
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:24,400
Your towel's all blue.

276
00:22:27,775 --> 00:22:28,969
Your soap's blue.

277
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:31,646
So? It's not mine.
I borrowed Xavier's.

278
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:32,676
I forgot mine.

279
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:45,515
Mickael, move.

280
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:47,986
What? You're a dead man.

281
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,492
Gimme your shower, bastard.

282
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,337
C'mon, show him, Mickael!

283
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,130
Clothes, lads!

284
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,601
- Help yourselves!
- Cut it out!

285
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,444
Okay, Tranh?

286
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,846
Fuckwit, you could've hurt me.

287
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,557
- We won.
- Brilliant.

288
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:57,222
- We're up for the European Cup.
- Yeah, brilliant.

289
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,893
How did you find me?

290
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:05,230
I know the neighborhood.
A pal lives nearby.

291
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,905
Put your cup down.
No one'll steal it.

292
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,044
What do the parents do?

293
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,446
I don't know.

294
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:23,750
Doctors or lawyers,
some shit like that.

295
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:25,855
You know what?

296
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:29,057
How can you wipe their kids' asses?

297
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:32,529
There's no shame in it.
Someone wiped your bottom too.

298
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:34,196
- Yeah...
- Yeah!

299
00:24:34,402 --> 00:24:36,371
But it wasn't a babysitter.

300
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:38,539
It was my mom, after work.

301
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,732
Maybe you'd have preferred
a babysitter...

302
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:43,638
Maybe I would have.

303
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,647
You'd rather I work at McDonald's?

304
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,407
You'd look cute.

305
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,313
I don't want to.

306
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,489
I'd rather look after
rich people's kids,

307
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,090
watch DVDs and eat Haagen-Dazs.

308
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,282
- Shit, Haagen-Dazs...
- Yeah...

309
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,891
Give me some, please.

310
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,324
Who's the pal who lives nearby?

311
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,101
A guy who just joined the club.

312
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:11,897
A rich kid, you mean.

313
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:21,276
That's enough.

314
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,345
- I'll be going.
- No!

315
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:30,123
How'll you get back tonight?

316
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:32,259
The father drives me home, here.

317
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:36,029
He doesn't chat you up, I hope.

318
00:25:36,465 --> 00:25:39,525
No, it's okay...
A little but it's okay.

319
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:44,099
Does he put his hand on your thigh
in his big car?

320
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:45,830
Are you crazy?

321
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,160
You're going too slow.
That's why you stall.

322
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,998
I'll do like you said.

323
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:16,469
Okay... Neutral...

324
00:26:16,772 --> 00:26:17,864
Then...

325
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,874
First gear...
I start it first, right?

326
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:26,979
Since when?

327
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,318
I honestly don't know.

328
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:31,810
Your first bender...

329
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,224
Before I did my national service.

330
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,752
So you were already drinking a lot
at my age?

331
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,229
Why are you asking?

332
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:47,832
Don't you and your judo pals drink?

333
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:50,338
Yes, we do.

334
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:53,173
But not too much.
We can't, see.

335
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,600
We don't drink every day.

336
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:58,041
Drinking every day's what bothers you?

337
00:26:58,247 --> 00:26:59,213
Is it different?

338
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,377
It's not that.

339
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,276
I booze, that's true.

340
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:08,951
Maybe you had an unhappy childhood.

341
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:13,385
- You lacked something?
- No.

342
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:16,558
Your sister and you ate your fill.

343
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,699
You always had a little holiday...

344
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,231
Yes, I know.

345
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:22,934
- You had a present at Christmas.
- Yeah...

346
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,128
Not a scooter

347
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,806
or a computer but you had something.

348
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:29,533
I know
but that's not what I mean, Dad.

349
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:31,242
What then?

350
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:35,278
I don't know.

351
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:38,783
Aren't you worried
Mom might leave?

352
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:40,755
That she'll get sick of it?

353
00:27:45,928 --> 00:27:46,952
Lads, they're here!

354
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:48,595
What color's this?

355
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:50,956
Grey is deadly!

356
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,932
X S, that's for Tranh.

357
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,249
Tranh will be off for two months.

358
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,123
You're his substitute.
There's a rule, so we stick by it.

359
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,093
We're up against Russia,
Italy and Slovenia!

360
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,092
I can step in if you want.

361
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,268
That's not possible.

362
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,495
In under 66? How heavy are you?

363
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,799
I don't know. I've put a bit on.
7 3, 7 4 maybe.

364
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:34,135
Not a good idea.

365
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:36,709
What? All judokas lose weight.

366
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:38,106
Not 8 kilos in 6 weeks!

367
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:42,112
The advantage is
no one knows me in that category.

368
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:44,786
I'll be physically tougher
than the others.

369
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:48,184
Not if you lose 8 kilos.
You'll lose your fast edge.

370
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,052
We don't have much choice.

371
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,456
If you fight in 66,
who'll fight in 7 3?

372
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,638
It'll do.

373
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:49,410
- You look pretty.
- Thanks.

374
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:51,771
- The bell doesn't work.
- I know.

375
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:53,243
It's okay, Mom!

376
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:01,855
Why's her head in the oven?

377
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,787
Don't worry. I'll explain.

378
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:09,422
Can you straighten this for me?

379
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,036
Can I recharge my mobile somewhere?

380
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:21,038
Stop staring at me.

381
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,172
You freak me out,
you look like vampires.

382
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:43,661
Good evening.

383
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:45,162
This is my mother.

384
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:48,200
Mickael's mother.
And his girlfriend, I presume.

385
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:49,564
Of course.

386
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,839
Vanessa...

387
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,371
Clement and his mum.

388
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:56,704
Shall I take that?

389
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,881
Sorry, I must seem ridiculous.

390
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:01,050
Not at all, it's kind of you.

391
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:15,728
That won't work for the Cup.

392
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:18,525
Have you seen his left guard?

393
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,164
Gently...

394
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,504
Tranh, stop spitting on me.

395
00:32:26,776 --> 00:32:29,438
One of those Slovenes is mean.

396
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,208
- Okay?
- Fine. And you?

397
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,715
I'm great.

398
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,254
Fancy a swim?

399
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,622
- No, thanks.
- It's great.

400
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,115
- Look.
- Stop it!

401
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,789
Mickael's parents.
Isabelle, my wife.

402
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:49,224
Did you make the olive cake?

403
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:52,026
It's delicious, not over-cooked...

404
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:57,696
Watch your son, he shouldn't
get too close to the buffet.

405
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,973
He's a big boy now.

406
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,739
Is it that bad?

407
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,938
He has a lot to lose.
A lot of weight to lose.

408
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:09,614
I don't see why
he needs to lose so much weight.

409
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,310
We need a good man in that category.

410
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,357
You don't know Gerard.
Come on, say, “Hello, Gerard,. "

411
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,299
He's my new friend.

412
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:26,934
He's going to play too.

413
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,298
Cut it out, lads, that's not right.

414
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,239
Mickael, it's tragic.

415
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:32,875
Some taboule, sweetheart?

416
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:34,440
As crispy as my mom's.

417
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,899
Come on, let him play!

418
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,902
Mickael, can you come upstairs?

419
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,105
Mickael! Come here...

420
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:11,412
You're Mickael Percepied?
I'm Dr. Imbert.

421
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,344
- Want a drink, Philippe?
- Sure.

422
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,418
Drink from my glass.

423
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:20,521
Careful, it's cold,
it might hurt your teeth.

424
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:22,424
Can I give him some?

425
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,683
No. What are you at?

426
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:27,686
I don't know. 7 2, I think.

427
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,832
- You're being careful?
- You bet.

428
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,194
Okay. Undress, and let's weigh you.

429
00:34:32,736 --> 00:34:34,067
Here?

430
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:36,567
Give me that, I'll hold it.

431
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,153
I couldn't resist.

432
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,654
Your girl likes judo?

433
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:02,263
She couldn't care less.
It bores her shitless.

434
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:05,195
When I watch,
I never know who's winning.

435
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:07,902
How heavy is he?

436
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,937
7 2. 8.
Still some way to go!

437
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:14,699
How will you manage it?

438
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:19,179
I'd like to get down to 69
by watching what I eat

439
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,181
and leave three kilos
for the last week.

440
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:25,983
Dr. Imbert can give you pills...

441
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,617
No, it's okay... For now, anyhow.

442
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:31,692
There's that dropper thing.
Whatever it's called...

443
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,555
A cream.

444
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,098
You put it up your rectum. Sorry...

445
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,934
And then you run for the crapper.

446
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,973
He's all right.

447
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:54,011
Don't panic, he's okay!

448
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:56,815
Up you come!

449
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,759
Don't spoil your evening.

450
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:09,825
I've put up with this crap for 20 years.

451
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,092
Everything's fine. Come on.

452
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:15,495
You're plastered.

453
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,406
Drunk.

454
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,737
Plastered like a new wall.
You get it?

455
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,275
You're going to sleep
but take this first.

456
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,146
A miracle remedy.

457
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,009
Go on, bite into it.

458
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,014
No, drinking will make it worse.
It's a pepper.

459
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,752
Wait 30 seconds and it'll pass.

460
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,920
You'll see.

461
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,327
Fuck, you scared me!

462
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,393
Know how to use a camera?

463
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,971
Can you keep a lookout?

464
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,602
- No, outside.
- I want to stay.

465
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:29,334
Are you kidding? I want to see.

466
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,509
- Low angle.
- Why?

467
00:37:31,715 --> 00:37:34,046
- Look...
- Go on!

468
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:39,017
Let me take one of you two now.

469
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,589
Lift your shirt up.

470
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,094
Your turn. Take me with him.

471
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,705
What if you blew me?

472
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:02,212
What if you blew your pal?

473
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,148
Go on, get over there with her.

474
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,213
Wrong way round.

475
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,117
Cut it out! Are you crazy?
You're nuts!

476
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,785
Press against her.

477
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:19,859
Stop it!

478
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:22,530
You're sick!

479
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,065
You're crazy!

480
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,434
Let's do one together.

481
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,765
All three of us.

482
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,909
<i>Is it my fault</i>
<i>you were way over the limit?</i>

483
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,135
<i>Not "way over". You piss me off.</i>

484
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,973
<i>If I'm just over,</i>
<i>It's "way over” with you!</i>

485
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,379
<i>6 months become a year,</i>
<i>10 kilometres become 20...</i>

486
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,281
<i>Well, for you, 15 beers</i>

487
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,922
<i>turn into 3. You're fucked now!</i>

488
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,755
- Shithead!
- Cut it out!

489
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,887
I don't believe it!

490
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,224
Cut it out, Mom. What's going on?

491
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,099
What are you doing? Go for your run!

492
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,462
What?

493
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,804
I don't know if you realize

494
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,407
but with all the non-fat yogurts
you gobbled up

495
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,906
for 3 euros at midday,

496
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,572
you've put on 300 grams!

497
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,847
Where the fuck is he?

498
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:28,845
Asshole!

499
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,783
That was the TV remote!

500
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,580
- Moron!
- Stop it!

501
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,289
Unemployed slob!

502
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,462
I'm out of work, okay.

503
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,291
One of 3 million in France.

504
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,133
It's a bummer

505
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:59,441
but no reason
to jump out of the window.

506
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,552
Your mother acts like it's a disaster,
the end of the world...

507
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:13,295
You never worry about anything,
as usual.

508
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,625
Here...

509
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,161
These are the bills.

510
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,703
Let's see you get out of that.
Give us a laugh!

511
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,502
You know your son
goes to university next year?

512
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,740
You think that's free?

513
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,178
We've got grants.

514
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:38,220
They won't cut his grant
'cause I was over the limit.

515
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,661
You've been predicting disaster
for years.

516
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:49,823
You keep pissing us all off,
warning us about what'll happen.

517
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,761
But this is fucking great!

518
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:57,430
You should be happy
now your disaster's happened at last!

519
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:47,481
Take deep breaths...

520
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,928
Isn't he drinking?

521
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,425
Yes...
He'll have a drop later.

522
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,363
You know his dad's been fired
from his job?

523
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,037
No. Why?

524
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:36,639
He's lost his license
and his boss won't have him back.

525
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:39,606
Well, he was a taxi-driver...

526
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,776
He's been doing it for 15 years now.

527
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:46,016
Fired after 15 years,
you think that's normal?

528
00:44:46,218 --> 00:44:49,209
Maybe it's not normal
but I'm not surprised.

529
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:52,686
He shouldn't give in.
He can get a provisional license.

530
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,519
Or he can sue them.

531
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,291
Come on, don't sleep.

532
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,130
You have to fight it.

533
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,852
Go on, I'll take over.

534
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,529
I'll take over.

535
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,601
Lower your legs.

536
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,735
Turn a bit like this.

537
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,408
There, like that.

538
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,339
Hold on, I'll help!

539
00:45:54,086 --> 00:45:55,576
I'm sweltering.

540
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,285
Help me.

541
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:27,241
My hair!

542
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:01,960
Can you help me, please?

543
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,478
It's your mother.

544
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:21,816
Hi, Mickael.

545
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,214
Hi, Ibrahim.

546
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:28,357
Ibrahim!

547
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,962
Go on ahead, I'll catch up.

548
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:34,899
- Where the hell were you?
- It took longer than planned.

549
00:50:35,168 --> 00:50:37,534
We could have found you in there.

550
00:50:37,737 --> 00:50:40,638
Your colleagues wouldn't tell,
they're okay.

551
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,205
Sure, they're okay.

552
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,842
You just don't realize, do you?

553
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,675
If they talk,
I'll be on welfare too.

554
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:50,178
- Just what we need!
- Don't exaggerate.

555
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:52,706
You know what?

556
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:57,221
We're going to forget
this key business for a while.

557
00:50:58,024 --> 00:51:00,515
- It's too risky.
- It's not risky!

558
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:01,819
It is.

559
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:05,420
I won't lose my job
so you can lose weight.

560
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:08,729
Just look at you!

561
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,073
Get lost now.

562
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:32,247
How many times did you have sex?

563
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:35,256
What exactly do you mean by that?

564
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:38,362
The number of times
the boy ejaculated?

565
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:42,423
Well...

566
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:47,196
Four. Four or five.
Maybe six, I'm not sure.

567
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,374
The exact figure doesn't matter.

568
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,241
When was the last time?

569
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,747
It all happened yesterday afternoon.

570
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,817
Not with one boy though.
There were two.

571
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:05,817
It's quite rare

572
00:52:06,093 --> 00:52:07,583
to find a boy who can

573
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:11,390
have sex four or five
or "maybe six” times in a row.

574
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:13,993
But...

575
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:17,064
How long between each time?

576
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:22,572
Actually,
it was with both boys at once.

577
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:31,943
Right...

578
00:52:32,885 --> 00:52:35,582
You'll take a pill right now
in my office.

579
00:52:35,788 --> 00:52:36,585
Okay.

580
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:38,758
And I'll give you another

581
00:52:38,992 --> 00:52:41,825
to take tomorrow morning.

582
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:43,154
Okay.

583
00:52:43,563 --> 00:52:45,292
- Is that all?
- That's all.

584
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:54,135
- Okay?
- Yeah.

585
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:58,305
- Did it go okay with the nurse?
- Great.

586
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:00,308
She's nice. Do you know her?

587
00:53:00,513 --> 00:53:01,480
No.

588
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:03,808
I'm aching all over. It's crazy.

589
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,679
It goes from here to here.

590
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:08,547
That's only natural...

591
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:12,891
What do you mean?
I'm used to it, you know.

592
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:16,062
You weren't necessarily using
the same muscles.

593
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,354
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

594
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:21,533
Not fries again!
Aren't there any vegetables?

595
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:23,031
We've got peas.

596
00:53:23,237 --> 00:53:25,705
Peas aren't vegetables, they're starch.

597
00:53:25,938 --> 00:53:28,236
Starch or starch today. Great!

598
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,068
I'd like some, please.

599
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:31,504
Can I have more?

600
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:58,354
Push against his foot.

601
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,856
It's just a cramp.

602
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:19,478
Good morning. Come in.

603
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:22,313
It's right here.

604
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,154
How much?

605
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,989
5, 999.

606
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:43,168
- Will you see him out?
- Of course.

607
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:45,565
Goodbye.

608
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,787
Okay!

609
00:57:54,174 --> 00:57:55,164
Thirsty?

610
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:00,340
I can't sleep

611
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:02,013
because I'm starving

612
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:04,445
and look what's on TV.

613
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,749
The Chinese are good at cooking.
And at judo.

614
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,317
Wrong, Dad, the Japanese do judo.

615
00:58:17,564 --> 00:58:19,464
I hate seeing you like this.

616
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,430
Only three more weeks.

617
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,634
I was wondering...

618
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:30,337
D'you need your bicycle next week?

619
00:58:30,544 --> 00:58:33,173
I'm sitting my exams next week.

620
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,643
Shit...

621
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:37,708
Why? You need to move about a lot?

622
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:39,477
Hold on...

623
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,186
The welfare office, social security,
the job center...

624
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,360
and the temp agency.

625
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,524
I was always told
to lean into a curve.

626
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:54,496
You lean into a curve.

627
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:58,633
It crushes my balls a bit.

628
00:59:01,376 --> 00:59:03,344
- Okay, Dad?
- You can't do that!

629
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:06,980
Oh, shit!

630
00:59:07,248 --> 00:59:08,647
This thing's crap.

631
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,545
Yeah, it's a piece of shit.

632
00:59:10,752 --> 00:59:12,481
You need to learn to fall.

633
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:16,555
One of the things you learn
is how to fall, see?

634
00:59:16,758 --> 00:59:18,487
Yeah, I know that.

635
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:32,832
- You took your time.
- Those fucking Chinese names...

636
01:00:33,968 --> 01:00:35,094
What Chinese names?

637
01:00:35,303 --> 01:00:38,739
How did you write Guangzhou?
"G U” or "G HU"?

638
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:40,465
What do you mean?

639
01:00:40,675 --> 01:00:42,234
You didn't do China?

640
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:44,502
It wasn't China, it was the US A.

641
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:48,441
- Shit...
- What?

642
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:50,583
- Oh, shit!
- What?

643
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:56,487
I mixed them up.
I mixed China up with the US A.

644
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:02,253
You put Chinese cities
on a map of the US A?

645
01:01:04,532 --> 01:01:05,931
Fuck, I knew everything...

646
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:10,930
Hold on, maybe it's not that bad.
They might not give you zero.

647
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:13,038
If I get zero, it's sick.

648
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:16,300
I knew all about China.

649
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:20,345
Agriculture, industry, soy, cotton,
rice, fucking paper...

650
01:01:20,548 --> 01:01:22,881
I even added a comment on Tibet!

651
01:01:24,018 --> 01:01:25,042
You're too much!

652
01:01:25,253 --> 01:01:26,948
Shit! Did you manage it?

653
01:01:27,722 --> 01:01:29,019
Piece of cake.

654
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:30,952
You're useless at geography!

655
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,149
I put Chicago, not Shanghai!

656
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,868
I was only there for six months.

657
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:47,735
It counts, you were a mechanic there.
We'll put it at the end.

658
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,810
We'll draw up a list...

659
01:01:51,012 --> 01:01:54,539
of all your skills...

660
01:01:54,749 --> 01:01:58,412
and put that you know
all about mechanics.

661
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,746
Yeah.

662
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:03,486
I know all about geography too.

663
01:02:03,691 --> 01:02:05,922
I don't mix China and the US A up.

664
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:09,094
Stop it.

665
01:02:09,297 --> 01:02:11,266
Go ahead, take the piss.

666
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,728
It doesn't matter.

667
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,369
If you fail,
you can work for your uncle.

668
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,097
Sure, and freeze my ass off
on work sites! No way!

669
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:22,840
- When do we eat?
- In two minutes.

670
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:24,910
We won't have finished, Mom.

671
01:02:25,113 --> 01:02:27,580
Still on yogurt and grapefruit?

672
01:02:27,816 --> 01:02:29,510
Okay, Dad, what year was it?

673
01:02:29,717 --> 01:02:31,344
What are you down to?

674
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:34,044
- 69.
- That's not possible, Dad.

675
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,211
You were 12!

676
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,517
- No, Leclin was in....
- How many did you say?

677
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:39,750
'7 3!

678
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:42,294
What? Seven more kilos to lose?

679
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:43,464
No, who said that?

680
01:02:43,998 --> 01:02:46,432
Dad. He said you were at 7 3.

681
01:02:46,634 --> 01:02:48,067
7 3? 7 3 what?

682
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:49,965
19 7 3!

683
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:51,432
You said 1969!

684
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:54,404
Mom asked me what you were at!

685
01:02:54,642 --> 01:02:57,543
You want to lose another seven kilos?
No way!

686
01:02:57,746 --> 01:03:00,943
Hold on, Leclin, in 19 7 3,
that was for me.

687
01:03:01,149 --> 01:03:03,140
Are you taking the piss again?

688
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:22,561
Mom!

689
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:25,271
We're out of toothpaste!

690
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,611
Are you going out tonight?

691
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:41,846
Yeah.

692
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:44,484
Here...

693
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:49,762
Celebrating the end of exams?

694
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:53,464
Who with?

695
01:03:53,802 --> 01:03:56,599
Everybody. The whole class, like.

696
01:03:56,805 --> 01:03:58,965
Dry yourself, you're wet.

697
01:04:04,346 --> 01:04:05,540
Here it goes!

698
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:07,671
Fuck!

699
01:04:07,883 --> 01:04:09,111
I almost died!

700
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:12,718
Give me the knife.

701
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:36,464
How much can you put in?

702
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:38,206
How about you?

703
01:05:38,474 --> 01:05:39,735
40 euros.

704
01:05:40,109 --> 01:05:41,370
On your own?

705
01:05:42,177 --> 01:05:44,270
I don't know. I can afford...

706
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:45,773
15 euros.

707
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,313
It doesn't matter.

708
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:49,948
No, forget it, it's better.

709
01:05:50,152 --> 01:05:51,950
Who cares? I'll pay for the room.

710
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:54,816
It doesn't matter, okay.

711
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,258
I'll give you my card.

712
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,792
No, it's okay, forget it.
You two go, it's better.

713
01:06:00,996 --> 01:06:03,397
It's okay. My P I N number is 433 7.

714
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:07,125
Forget it. If I get it wrong,
the guy'll want my ID...

715
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:09,269
- Rubbish! Here.
- No, go on.

716
01:06:09,471 --> 01:06:11,496
We'll go in together, never mind.

717
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:13,401
Join us in ten minutes, okay.

718
01:06:14,043 --> 01:06:15,237
See you.

719
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,658
Good evening.

720
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:48,365
Two people just checked in...

721
01:07:48,738 --> 01:07:49,932
Young people...

722
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:53,399
They're friends of mine.

723
01:07:56,479 --> 01:07:58,572
Shall I call them for you?

724
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:07,550
There's no reply.

725
01:08:07,757 --> 01:08:08,951
There isn't?

726
01:08:20,236 --> 01:08:22,534
Vanessa, it's me.

727
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:24,905
I don't know where you are.

728
01:08:31,781 --> 01:08:32,907
Fuck...

729
01:09:34,677 --> 01:09:37,009
The soap's really tiny in this hotel.

730
01:09:37,913 --> 01:09:39,437
Let me see.

731
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,645
It'll do.

732
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:45,278
It's enough to share.

733
01:09:45,488 --> 01:09:47,479
You don't need much!

734
01:09:48,924 --> 01:09:50,516
You're here to wash?

735
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:55,053
You've got something in your hair.

736
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,031
It smells good though.

737
01:10:05,274 --> 01:10:06,673
Let me see.

738
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:22,816
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling him.

739
01:10:48,818 --> 01:10:49,945
Yeah?

740
01:10:51,787 --> 01:10:53,448
I split.

741
01:10:54,558 --> 01:10:55,615
What?

742
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,422
I can't hear you, Vanessa.

743
01:10:59,228 --> 01:11:00,627
No, I split.

744
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:05,457
So what? I'm not interested.

745
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:08,094
I said I'm not interested.

746
01:11:10,339 --> 01:11:12,398
No, I haven't gone home.

747
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:17,412
Forget it.

748
01:11:19,516 --> 01:11:21,711
Just get off my back, okay?

749
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,479
You don't need me.

750
01:11:27,923 --> 01:11:31,051
I said get off my back.
Don't call me, okay?

751
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,285
I'm sick of this, okay?

752
01:11:35,297 --> 01:11:37,232
Why is she calling at home?

753
01:11:38,602 --> 01:11:41,126
- Have you fallen out?
- Sure...

754
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,668
Go on, call her.

755
01:11:42,873 --> 01:11:46,137
Give it a rest!
I'm fighting tomorrow.

756
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,108
You understand that?

757
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:51,007
I'm fighting tomorrow.
I have 800 grams to lose.

758
01:11:51,213 --> 01:11:52,942
Where are they coming from?

759
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:54,981
Try getting a bone removed.

760
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,285
- Can you give me the sauna keys?
- What?

761
01:11:57,486 --> 01:11:59,977
- The sauna keys, please.
- I said no.

762
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:02,988
Come on,
I don't have a gram of fat left.

763
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:05,319
All I can lose now is water.

764
01:12:06,228 --> 01:12:07,856
By the way, your dad and I

765
01:12:08,064 --> 01:12:10,793
will celebrate our anniversary
on July 7.

766
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,331
Okay, fine.

767
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,004
You know I can't.
I'm away on a course.

768
01:12:15,204 --> 01:12:17,935
You'll always find an excuse anyway!

769
01:12:18,808 --> 01:12:20,935
Can I have the keys, please?

770
01:12:22,144 --> 01:12:24,113
Maybe we can work it out...

771
01:12:24,814 --> 01:12:26,337
That course of yours,

772
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:29,678
say you'll arrive on the Monday.
That's what I want.

773
01:12:29,886 --> 01:12:32,354
I can't!
Do it on the weekend of July 14.

774
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,354
Sure, July 14!
Everyone will be away.

775
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,686
Great date for a party!

776
01:12:37,894 --> 01:12:41,853
So do it on the 7th! I don't give a shit
about your anniversary.

777
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,524
Fuck...

778
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:46,967
Where do you think you are?

779
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,629
Why are you fucking me about?

780
01:12:49,839 --> 01:12:51,739
It's hard keeping up with you.

781
01:12:51,942 --> 01:12:55,207
Before, you wanted to leave Dad
and kill yourself,

782
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,880
now you want to have a party?

783
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:08,811
Good evening.

784
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:15,617
They've sent some photos of the party.

785
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:18,788
Look.

786
01:14:18,995 --> 01:14:21,657
They're odd. They're divided into four.

787
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:23,659
Can you turn it off?

788
01:14:34,444 --> 01:14:36,742
There's an envelope for you, Mickael.

789
01:14:39,849 --> 01:14:41,078
N ice one with Vanessa.

790
01:14:41,284 --> 01:14:43,309
Are you crazy?

791
01:14:49,225 --> 01:14:50,658
And a fine.

792
01:15:12,749 --> 01:15:14,307
He's in his room.

793
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:20,716
It's Vanessa.
Won't you talk to her?

794
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:23,619
He won't talk.

795
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:28,223
What's happened between you?

796
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:30,356
Stay out of it!

797
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,668
Can it work out?

798
01:15:37,674 --> 01:15:40,905
- You've got the wrong idea.
- Mom, this is sick!

799
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:43,170
Are you playing the go-between?

800
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:46,349
You won't get anywhere tonight.

801
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,540
Coming to the dojo tomorrow?

802
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:51,418
She never comes,
she doesn't want to!

803
01:15:51,688 --> 01:15:53,680
She couldn't care less.
Cut it out!

804
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,483
Did you hear that?

805
01:15:57,862 --> 01:15:59,762
Actually, she says she can.

806
01:16:01,732 --> 01:16:03,563
You won't have to talk to her...

807
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,326
Fucking nightmare!

808
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,760
Percepied, Mickael: under 66.

809
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:17,097
You're 400 grams over.

810
01:17:17,307 --> 01:17:18,832
Is the scale right?

811
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:21,511
- Hurry, weigh-in ends in 10 minutes.
- Wait...

812
01:17:29,453 --> 01:17:31,284
Still 350 grams over.

813
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:33,423
Check! I'm sure I'm okay.

814
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:35,785
Steiner, Clement: under 7 3.

815
01:17:35,993 --> 01:17:38,620
- What were you at yesterday?
- I was fine then.

816
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,456
What were you at exactly?

817
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:42,427
66! Bang on!

818
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:45,033
- You ate this morning?
- Are you crazy?

819
01:17:45,235 --> 01:17:47,966
No food for 48 hours,
no liquids since yesterday.

820
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:49,434
Run! Run all you can!

821
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,835
Give him your tracksuits, lads!

822
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,805
It's no use, there's no time.

823
01:17:55,346 --> 01:17:56,677
D'you need a piss?

824
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,940
Piss what?
I have nothing to piss!

825
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,055
Just a second...

826
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:18,994
I swear I haven't eaten a thing.

827
01:18:19,203 --> 01:18:20,500
I was okay yesterday.

828
01:18:20,704 --> 01:18:21,864
Come on.

829
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:25,875
Trust me.

830
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:27,805
Calm down. Open your mouth.

831
01:18:28,012 --> 01:18:30,412
- What?
- Open your mouth. Calm down.

832
01:18:38,522 --> 01:18:39,922
Have a puke.

833
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,691
Go on.

834
01:18:45,196 --> 01:18:46,390
Relax.

835
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:50,191
Let it all out...

836
01:18:59,043 --> 01:19:01,238
Under 66: Percepied...

837
01:19:07,485 --> 01:19:09,452
You're still too heavy.

838
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,186
Empty out your lungs.

839
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:23,695
Okay.

840
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:40,380
- Hello, Mr. Steiner.
- Okay, lads?

841
01:19:40,718 --> 01:19:43,051
- Do good today.
- No problem.

842
01:19:43,253 --> 01:19:44,049
Okay?

843
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:46,222
- Everyone's the right weight?
- Everyone.

844
01:19:46,424 --> 01:19:47,651
Hi, son.

845
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:18,150
You can't stay here, Vanessa.

846
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:20,551
The lads will need the showers.

847
01:20:20,758 --> 01:20:22,920
Not just before fighting.

848
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:39,732
You're eating again? That's cool.

849
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:46,009
I fight in 15 minutes.
Why are you here pissing me off?

850
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:49,380
Any normal chick
would be sitting on the stands.

851
01:20:51,556 --> 01:20:55,787
You know, even if you lose out there,
it doesn't matter.

852
01:20:57,428 --> 01:21:00,364
I'll still love you
and it won't change things.

853
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,690
Fuck, you shouldn't say that.
That's fucking useless.

854
01:21:05,436 --> 01:21:06,768
You're a useless coach!

855
01:21:07,672 --> 01:21:09,730
How do I rate as a girlfriend?

856
01:21:09,973 --> 01:21:12,568
As a girlfriend? You're a slut.

857
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:15,977
You prefer virgins?

858
01:21:19,117 --> 01:21:20,982
I got it all wrong, then.

859
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:27,948
I'll never forgive you
for what you did at the hotel.

860
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,425
What “I” did?

861
01:21:31,496 --> 01:21:33,088
But I did it with you.

862
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,164
And you were beautiful.

863
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,904
Why did you leave me there?

864
01:21:50,315 --> 01:21:53,250
- Because it was horrible.
- What was?

865
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,419
All of it. From the beginning.

866
01:21:57,489 --> 01:21:58,820
The hotel was weird

867
01:22:00,657 --> 01:22:02,819
but the rest was good.

868
01:22:03,026 --> 01:22:04,426
Did you like it?

869
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:11,031
Tell me the truth.
Didn't you like it just a bit?

870
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:15,670
- What if I did?
- Well, I liked it too.

871
01:22:21,212 --> 01:22:23,180
Was it better than with me?

872
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:27,810
It was very good with the two of you.

873
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:35,656
It was better than anything.

874
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:38,320
It was a thousand times better.

875
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:41,665
I know you felt that too.

876
01:22:41,867 --> 01:22:44,699
I don't understand
why you won't admit it.

877
01:22:57,215 --> 01:22:59,547
You prefer it when it's not so good?

878
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:06,182
You don't like it when it's better?

879
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:13,156
Get your guard up!

880
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,326
Go!

881
01:23:18,537 --> 01:23:19,764
Watch the edges.

882
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,202
- I know.
- You're in the lead.

883
01:23:23,442 --> 01:23:25,103
It's good, you'll get him.

884
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,242
Go!

885
01:23:37,155 --> 01:23:38,349
Excuse me...

886
01:23:46,098 --> 01:23:48,396
Watch his right!

887
01:23:49,735 --> 01:23:51,566
Go, Mickael!

888
01:24:19,131 --> 01:24:20,496
The left!

889
01:24:36,882 --> 01:24:38,348
You're crazy!

890
01:25:10,883 --> 01:25:12,373
What happened?

891
01:25:15,688 --> 01:25:18,282
Let me finish my story.

892
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,481
Your holiday interests me too.

893
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:24,128
The other day, just before leaving,
I needed money.

894
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:28,198
I went down to the cash point.
The post office was closed

895
01:25:28,434 --> 01:25:32,200
so I used the one outside.
I don't know what happened

896
01:25:32,738 --> 01:25:35,172
but it was giving only 20-euro notes.

897
01:25:35,374 --> 01:25:37,001
To start with...

898
01:25:37,543 --> 01:25:39,738
Anyhow,
I counted them over and over

899
01:25:39,944 --> 01:25:42,914
but there was a note missing,
I know there was.

900
01:25:48,454 --> 01:25:50,080
This is it.

901
01:25:51,223 --> 01:25:53,657
- Not bad, huh?
- It looks great.

902
01:25:54,193 --> 01:25:57,889
A bus meets you at the airport
to take you to the hotel.

903
01:25:58,731 --> 01:26:00,323
Is it a campsite?

904
01:26:00,532 --> 01:26:02,089
No, they're hotel rooms.

905
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:03,892
You'll be bored shitless,

906
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:05,536
after camping for so long.

907
01:26:05,738 --> 01:26:07,171
It'll be brilliant!

908
01:26:07,373 --> 01:26:10,000
They make your bed,
bring you your meals...

909
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:11,708
Maybe, but you pay for it.

910
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,775
Not that much, actually.

911
01:26:13,978 --> 01:26:16,106
It's two weeks for the price of one.

912
01:26:16,315 --> 01:26:19,682
Plus another 15% off in September.

913
01:26:19,885 --> 01:26:20,943
That's worth it!

914
01:26:21,153 --> 01:26:23,519
Maybe, but personally,

915
01:26:23,722 --> 01:26:25,519
I like to make my own bed.

916
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:27,088
But why?

917
01:26:27,593 --> 01:26:28,560
I don't know.

918
01:26:29,128 --> 01:26:32,097
It would seem odd.
I'd feel embarrassed.

919
01:26:32,297 --> 01:26:34,788
- You made other people's beds!
- Exactly.

920
01:26:37,336 --> 01:26:39,896
Too bad
the weather won't be good then.

921
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:42,439
It's always good there.

922
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:44,308
In any case,

923
01:26:44,576 --> 01:26:49,070
with Gerard's welfare money
and the rise in family allowance,

924
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,943
we're better off than before.

925
01:26:52,151 --> 01:26:52,913
Here's to welfare!

926
01:26:53,986 --> 01:26:56,716
It's a pity in a way...

927
01:26:57,623 --> 01:26:58,920
Maybe, but still...

928
01:26:59,124 --> 01:27:00,921
You killjoy!

929
01:27:34,393 --> 01:27:36,486
You're not pleased they're happy?

930
01:27:36,695 --> 01:27:39,289
It's obvious they're happy.

931
01:27:40,133 --> 01:27:43,260
To be honest, they disgust me.

932
01:27:43,469 --> 01:27:45,198
You're crazy.

933
01:27:48,508 --> 01:27:49,940
Has Mom told you

934
01:27:50,143 --> 01:27:52,702
about when they first moved here?

935
01:27:52,911 --> 01:27:55,778
Well, Gran applied
for low-rent housing, see.

936
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:58,616
It was accepted and they moved here.

937
01:27:58,817 --> 01:28:00,648
They were packing to move

938
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:04,653
and, the day before,
Gran and Grandad brought the kids

939
01:28:04,857 --> 01:28:07,986
to see the new flat, as a treat.

940
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,961
They got here
and couldn't believe their eyes.

941
01:28:12,165 --> 01:28:14,998
Everything was new.
The walls were white,

942
01:28:15,501 --> 01:28:19,632
there were radiators in every room
and hot water in the taps.

943
01:28:19,838 --> 01:28:21,066
Mom was over the moon.

944
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:24,800
She'd be able to wash in hot water
for the first time!

945
01:28:25,043 --> 01:28:29,378
She and the other kids were so excited,
they pestered Gran and Grandad

946
01:28:29,581 --> 01:28:33,483
to stay in the new flat
rather than go back to the old slum.

947
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,381
Did Gran and Grandad agree?

948
01:28:35,587 --> 01:28:37,556
Yeah. I guess they were happy too.

949
01:28:37,756 --> 01:28:40,884
They were in a good mood
so they agreed.

950
01:28:42,127 --> 01:28:43,526
And so...

951
01:28:44,396 --> 01:28:46,762
they all stayed
and slept on the floor

952
01:28:46,965 --> 01:28:49,560
in a totally empty flat.

953
01:28:49,768 --> 01:28:53,398
That's crazy.
No one ever told me about that.

954
01:28:53,605 --> 01:28:56,939
When I was little
and we were living here,

955
01:28:57,142 --> 01:28:59,771
I always got Mom
to tell me that story.

956
01:28:59,978 --> 01:29:01,844
As a bedtime story...

957
01:29:02,047 --> 01:29:03,878
I don't know why.

958
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:06,846
It's a crazy thing because...

959
01:29:07,052 --> 01:29:10,419
I think it's hard realizing
your parents were kids.

960
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:12,522
That brought it home to me.

961
01:29:12,724 --> 01:29:15,853
It made me cry
and it made me mad too.

962
01:29:16,061 --> 01:29:20,259
I thought it was brilliant
to have hot water everywhere...

963
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:35,479
What does it mean?

964
01:29:38,017 --> 01:29:39,574
Is it a real monster?

965
01:29:39,786 --> 01:29:41,117
A real monster?

966
01:29:41,321 --> 01:29:42,982
Have you ever seen monsters?

967
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:44,382
Frankenstein?

968
01:29:45,325 --> 01:29:48,055
The Hulk, maybe? In real life?

969
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,819
No, of course not.

970
01:29:52,332 --> 01:29:55,062
So what is this monster?
In French...

971
01:29:55,634 --> 01:29:57,659
It can be just about anything.

972
01:29:59,638 --> 01:30:01,004
Her fears,

973
01:30:02,474 --> 01:30:03,839
her anxieties...

974
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:08,510
It's sexual too.
She has discovered sex.

975
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:21,083
- How many points behind are you?
- 35.

976
01:30:21,293 --> 01:30:22,659
That's a lot.

977
01:30:22,862 --> 01:30:25,353
If I'm generous and give you 15...

978
01:30:25,565 --> 01:30:27,123
where does that get you?

979
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:29,702
Three eights, 24.

980
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:31,526
That's the best I can do.

981
01:30:34,406 --> 01:30:37,342
You did well in class all year though.

982
01:30:39,578 --> 01:30:42,046
- Have you had problems?
- No.

983
01:31:00,599 --> 01:31:02,693
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

984
01:31:03,069 --> 01:31:04,832
You'll get your kimono back out.

985
01:31:05,038 --> 01:31:06,062
Yeah...

986
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:10,036
Maybe. But, you know,

987
01:31:10,242 --> 01:31:13,406
I'm not sure I really like judo.

988
01:31:19,251 --> 01:31:21,516
It's okay, it's on me.

989
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:24,581
- You don't want anything?
- No, thanks.

990
01:31:25,858 --> 01:31:27,348
Is that you?

991
01:31:28,961 --> 01:31:30,986
I like the hair.

992
01:31:31,197 --> 01:31:32,221
Your first girlfriend?

993
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:37,559
What's her name?

994
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,073
Is that Vanessa?

995
01:31:43,142 --> 01:31:45,201
How old were you then?

996
01:31:45,411 --> 01:31:48,039
I don't know. Seven or so.

997
01:31:48,648 --> 01:31:49,740
Seriously?

998
01:31:50,883 --> 01:31:51,850
Still seeing her?

999
01:31:52,051 --> 01:31:54,019
Am I still seeing her? No.

1000
01:31:55,488 --> 01:31:57,615
But you've seen her again?

1001
01:31:58,424 --> 01:31:59,721
Not really, no.

1002
01:32:02,061 --> 01:32:03,688
Have you got her address?

1003
01:32:27,153 --> 01:32:29,713
We've got an evaluation session.

1004
01:32:36,162 --> 01:32:38,597
- Are your parents well?
- They're okay.

1005
01:32:38,798 --> 01:32:40,925
They're buying a van.

1006
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:43,095
To travel more.

1007
01:33:06,726 --> 01:33:09,320
- Don't laugh at me.
- Why would I?

1008
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:26,470
Come on, let's move.

1009
01:33:27,714 --> 01:33:29,806
Anything you want to do?

1010
01:33:30,016 --> 01:33:31,541
No, whatever you want.

1011
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:39,815
There's an aquarium
down by the harbor.

1012
01:33:40,593 --> 01:33:42,118
It's not bad.

1013
01:33:49,169 --> 01:33:50,534
Want to do that?

1014
01:33:51,171 --> 01:33:52,399
No, not really.

1015
01:34:03,516 --> 01:34:05,416
We could see a film, then.

1016
01:34:07,687 --> 01:34:09,348
Is there one you want to see?

1017
01:34:09,556 --> 01:34:11,217
Maybe, what's showing?

1018
01:34:11,424 --> 01:34:12,756
I don't know.

1019
01:34:26,406 --> 01:34:28,840
I have to call in at a shop.

1020
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:31,943
I need a top
for a thing that's on tonight.

1021
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:35,844
- What's on tonight?
- A thing.

1022
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:40,285
You can come with me...

1023
01:34:41,221 --> 01:34:43,381
To pick the top, I mean.

1024
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:49,360
- Here, I've found one.
- Cool.

1025
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:54,697
I picked out some others to try.

1026
01:34:58,472 --> 01:34:59,495
Not this one.

1027
01:35:07,247 --> 01:35:09,215
This one's too transparent.

1028
01:35:12,419 --> 01:35:14,319
Too Lolita...

1029
01:36:08,075 --> 01:36:10,202
<i>I'm glad autumn is here</i>

1030
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:14,604
<i>and that the days are free of the stress</i>
<i>of exams and matches.</i>

1031
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:20,113
<i>I haven't changed much physically.</i>

1032
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:23,053
<i>I've just put on a few kilos.</i>

1033
01:36:25,726 --> 01:36:28,923
<i>By day, I often feel weird.</i>

1034
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:33,791
<i>But I can sense a kind of peace too.</i>

1035
01:36:35,903 --> 01:36:38,098
<i>I guess I'm like everybody else.</i>

1036
01:36:40,441 --> 01:36:42,601
<i>People aren't good or evil.</i>

1037
01:36:44,011 --> 01:36:45,069
<i>People change, that's all.</i>

1038
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:49,044
<i>Or rather, change into something else.</i>

1039
01:36:50,284 --> 01:36:54,311
<i>What matters is seeing and</i>
<i>understanding what they change into.</i>

1040
01:36:57,524 --> 01:36:59,253
<i>They're like little devils.</i>

1041
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,920
<i>Overnight,</i>
<i>they become heavier, lighter,</i>

1042
01:37:05,766 --> 01:37:09,497
<i>darker, slower, tenser, sweeter,</i>

1043
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:11,897
<i>harder or more human.</i>
