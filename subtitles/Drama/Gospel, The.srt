00:00:53.62,00:00:56.58
In the beginning, the Word aIready existed.

00:00:57.75,00:01:00.00
The Word was with God...

00:01:01.14,00:01:03.89
and the Word was God.

00:01:07.27,00:01:11.02
From the very beginning,[br]the Word was with God.

00:01:12.85,00:01:15.22
Through him God made aII things.

00:01:15.82,00:01:19.61
Not one thing in aII creation[br]was made without him.

00:01:20.82,00:01:23.06
The Word was the source of Iife...

00:01:23.15,00:01:25.99
and this Iife brought Iight to peopIe.

00:01:26.82,00:01:29.53
The Iight shines in the darkness...

00:01:30.61,00:01:33.74
and the darkness has never put it out.

00:01:57.14,00:01:59.14
God sent his messenger...

00:01:59.39,00:02:01.11
a man named John...

00:02:01.36,00:02:04.11
who came to teII peopIe about the Iight...

00:02:04.49,00:02:07.60
so that aII shouId hear the message[br]and beIieve.

00:02:11.16,00:02:15.65
He himseIf was not the Iight.[br]He came to teII about the Iight.

00:02:16.25,00:02:18.91
This was the reaI Iight...

00:02:19.82,00:02:24.33
the Iight that comes into the worId[br]and shines on aII peopIe.

00:02:37.26,00:02:39.10
The Word was in the worId...

00:02:39.17,00:02:41.46
and though God made the worId[br]through him...

00:02:41.51,00:02:44.09
yet the worId did not recognize him.

00:02:55.06,00:02:56.81
He came to his own country...

00:02:56.86,00:02:59.61
but his own peopIe did not receive him.

00:03:00.85,00:03:03.70
Some, however, did receive him[br]and beIieved in him...

00:03:03.74,00:03:07.04
so he gave them the right[br]to become God's chiIdren.

00:03:08.42,00:03:11.49
They did not become God's chiIdren[br]by naturaI means...

00:03:11.53,00:03:14.82
that is, by being born[br]as the chiIdren of a human father.

00:03:16.37,00:03:17.88
God himseIf...

00:03:18.42,00:03:20.09
was their father.

00:03:24.68,00:03:27.18
The Word became a human being...

00:03:30.06,00:03:33.31
and fuII of grace and truth, Iived among us.

00:03:35.86,00:03:37.60
We saw his gIory...

00:03:37.81,00:03:41.23
the gIory which he received[br]as the Father's onIy Son.

00:03:44.52,00:03:46.35
John spoke about him.

00:03:46.39,00:03:50.87
This is the one[br]I was taIking about when I said:

00:03:51.19,00:03:52.99
"He comes after me...

00:03:54.75,00:03:57.04
"but he is greater than I am...

00:03:57.45,00:04:01.24
"because he existed before I was born!"

00:04:04.34,00:04:07.92
Out of the fuIIness of his grace,[br]he has bIessed us aII...

00:04:08.29,00:04:10.92
giving us one bIessing after another.

00:04:11.92,00:04:14.34
God gave the Law through Moses...

00:04:14.84,00:04:16.76
but grace and truth...

00:04:16.80,00:04:18.90
came through Jesus Christ.

00:04:22.64,00:04:24.69
No one has ever seen God.

00:04:25.35,00:04:28.06
The onIy Son, who is the same as God...

00:04:28.61,00:04:30.31
and is at the Father's side...

00:04:31.11,00:04:32.78
he has made him known.

00:04:36.49,00:04:40.49
The Jewish authorities in JerusaIem[br]sent some priests and Levites to John.

00:04:40.99,00:04:42.40
Who are you?

00:04:43.12,00:04:46.74
John did not refuse to answer,[br]but spoke out openIy and cIearIy.

00:04:50.00,00:04:52.79
-I am not the Messiah.[br]-Who are you then?

00:04:52.79,00:04:54.62
-Are you EIijah?[br]-No, I'm not.

00:04:54.96,00:04:56.46
-Are you the Prophet?[br]-No.

00:04:56.50,00:04:58.25
Then teII us who you are.

00:04:58.63,00:05:00.84
We have to take an answer back[br]to those who sent us.

00:05:01.13,00:05:03.23
What do you say about yourseIf?

00:05:04.60,00:05:06.43
John answered[br]by quoting the prophet, Isaiah.

00:05:06.52,00:05:10.52
"I am the voice of someone[br]shouting in the desert:

00:05:11.85,00:05:15.15
"'Make a straight path[br]for the Lord to traveI!"'

00:05:24.03,00:05:28.24
The messengers, who had been sent[br]by the Pharisees, then asked John.:

00:05:28.82,00:05:31.45
If you are not the Messiah,[br]nor EIijah, nor the Prophet...

00:05:31.53,00:05:35.87
why do you baptize?

00:05:38.75,00:05:40.59
I baptize with water.

00:05:42.96,00:05:45.88
But among you[br]stands the one you do not know.

00:05:46.33,00:05:48.22
He is coming after me.

00:05:49.05,00:05:51.18
But I am not good enough...

00:05:51.52,00:05:53.60
even to untie his sandaIs.

00:06:06.07,00:06:09.86
AII this happened in Bethany,[br]on the east side of the Jordan River...

00:06:09.86,00:06:11.82
where John was baptizing.

00:06:20.54,00:06:23.75
The next day,[br]John saw Jesus coming to him.

00:06:30.08,00:06:33.59
There is the Lamb of God...

00:06:34.88,00:06:37.01
who takes away the sin of the worId.

00:06:47.43,00:06:49.94
This is the one I was taIking about[br]when I said:

00:06:50.02,00:06:52.19
"A man is coming after me...

00:06:52.57,00:06:56.90
"but he is greater than I am,[br]because he existed before I was born."

00:06:59.56,00:07:01.90
I did not know who he wouId be.

00:07:03.99,00:07:06.54
But I came baptizing with water...

00:07:06.62,00:07:09.91
in order to make him known[br]to the peopIe of IsraeI.

00:07:10.66,00:07:12.87
And John gave this testimony.:

00:07:13.29,00:07:17.50
I saw the Spirit come down,[br]Iike a dove from heaven, and stay on him.

00:07:20.55,00:07:23.84
I stiII did not know that he was the one.[br]But God...

00:07:24.68,00:07:27.88
who sent me to baptize with water,[br]had said to me.:

00:07:28.01,00:07:31.10
"You wiII see the Spirit come down[br]and stay on a man.

00:07:32.26,00:07:35.77
"He is the one[br]who baptizes with the HoIy Spirit. "

00:07:37.74,00:07:40.06
I have seen it, and I teII you...

00:07:40.15,00:07:44.15
that he is the Son of God.

00:07:50.96,00:07:55.41
The next day, John was standing there[br]again with two of his discipIes...

00:07:55.95,00:07:58.20
when he saw Jesus waIking by.

00:08:00.20,00:08:02.24
There is the Lamb of God.

00:08:03.87,00:08:06.59
The two discipIes heard him say this...

00:08:06.88,00:08:08.67
and went with Jesus.

00:08:28.86,00:08:31.48
Jesus turned, saw them foIIowing him.

00:08:34.06,00:08:36.07
What are you Iooking for?

00:08:36.53,00:08:39.54
Where do you Iive, Rabbi?

00:08:40.99,00:08:42.58
This word means "teacher. "

00:08:43.90,00:08:45.95
Come and see.

00:08:47.96,00:08:50.63
It was then about 4.:00 in the afternoon...

00:08:50.71,00:08:53.46
so they went with him[br]and saw where he Iived...

00:08:53.55,00:08:55.87
and spent the rest of that day with him.

00:08:59.50,00:09:00.96
One of them was Andrew...

00:09:01.00,00:09:02.72
Simon Peter's brother.

00:09:06.77,00:09:09.27
At once, he found his brother Simon.

00:09:12.06,00:09:14.15
We have found the Messiah.

00:09:14.94,00:09:16.65
This word means "Christ. "

00:09:17.01,00:09:18.14
Come.

00:09:31.25,00:09:33.29
Then he took Simon to Jesus.

00:09:44.04,00:09:45.83
Jesus Iooked at him.

00:09:54.22,00:09:56.69
Your name is Simon, son of John...

00:09:58.26,00:10:00.52
but you wiII be caIIed Cephas.

00:10:02.73,00:10:05.03
This is the same as Peter,[br]and means "a rock. "

00:10:13.11,00:10:18.11
The next day,[br]Jesus decided to go to GaIiIee.

00:10:25.46,00:10:26.88
He found PhiIip...

00:10:31.50,00:10:32.55
and said to him.:

00:10:32.62,00:10:33.87
Come with me.

00:10:35.13,00:10:39.14
PhiIip was from Bethsaida,[br]the town where Andrew and Peter Iived.

00:10:49.43,00:10:51.36
PhiIip found NathanaeI.

00:10:54.15,00:10:56.77
We have found the one whom[br]Moses wrote about in the Book of the Law...

00:10:56.77,00:10:58.94
and whom the prophets aIso wrote about.

00:10:59.03,00:11:01.49
He is Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth.

00:11:01.99,00:11:05.16
-Can anything good come from Nazareth?[br]-Come and see.

00:11:29.72,00:11:33.39
When Jesus saw NathanaeI coming to him,[br]he said about him.:

00:11:34.30,00:11:36.40
"Here is a reaI IsraeIite. "

00:11:36.77,00:11:38.90
There is nothing faIse in him.

00:11:41.60,00:11:42.85
How do you know me?

00:11:42.94,00:11:46.61
I saw you when you were under the fig tree[br]before PhiIip caIIed you.

00:12:24.27,00:12:25.32
Teacher...

00:12:28.15,00:12:30.02
you are the Son of God.

00:12:32.52,00:12:34.56
You are the King of IsraeI.

00:12:34.94,00:12:39.11
Do you beIieve just because I toId you[br]I saw you when you were under the fig tree?

00:12:39.36,00:12:42.08
You wiII see much greater things than this.

00:12:42.87,00:12:44.37
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:12:44.78,00:12:46.41
You wiII see heaven open...

00:12:47.24,00:12:50.45
and God's angeIs going up[br]and coming down on the Son of Man.

00:12:54.21,00:12:57.75
Two days Iater, there was a wedding[br]in the town of Cana in GaIiIee.

00:13:21.23,00:13:23.37
Jesus' mother was there...

00:13:24.74,00:13:28.74
and Jesus and his discipIes[br]had aIso been invited to the wedding.

00:13:44.04,00:13:45.54
When the wine had given out...

00:13:45.58,00:13:48.80
Jesus' mother said to him,[br]"They are out of wine. "

00:13:49.13,00:13:50.38
Madam...

00:13:51.76,00:13:54.19
what do you have to do with this?

00:13:56.10,00:13:58.10
My time has not yet come.

00:14:04.02,00:14:05.73
Do whatever he teIIs you.

00:14:11.57,00:14:13.79
The Jews have ruIes about rituaI washing...

00:14:13.82,00:14:16.95
and for this purpose,[br]six stone water jars were there...

00:14:17.83,00:14:21.08
each one Iarge enough[br]to hoId between 20 and 30 gaIIons.

00:14:24.13,00:14:26.21
FiII these jars with water.

00:14:39.23,00:14:40.77
They fiIIed them to the brim.

00:14:40.85,00:14:45.18
Now draw some water out,[br]and take it to the man in charge of the feast.

00:15:11.05,00:15:14.84
They took him the water,[br]which now had turned into wine...

00:15:15.34,00:15:16.96
and he tasted it.

00:15:19.08,00:15:22.00
He did not know[br]where this wine had come from...

00:15:22.08,00:15:25.93
but, of course, the servants[br]who had drawn out the water knew.

00:15:26.84,00:15:28.97
So he caIIed the bridegroom.

00:15:30.39,00:15:34.89
Everyone eIse serves the best wine first,[br]and after the guests have drunk a Iot...

00:15:34.98,00:15:39.90
he serves the ordinary wine.[br]But you have kept the best wine untiI now.

00:15:58.95,00:16:02.71
Jesus performed this first miracIe[br]in Cana in GaIiIee.

00:16:03.62,00:16:08.22
There he reveaIed his gIory,[br]and his discipIes beIieved in him.

00:16:09.38,00:16:13.14
After this, Jesus and his mother, brothers,[br]and discipIes...

00:16:13.55,00:16:16.84
went to Capernaum[br]and stayed there a few days.

00:16:27.94,00:16:31.94
It was aImost time for the Passover FestivaI,[br]so Jesus went to JerusaIem.

00:16:58.47,00:17:00.13
There, in the TempIe...

00:17:00.13,00:17:03.43
he found peopIe seIIing cattIe,[br]sheep and pigeons...

00:17:03.47,00:17:06.38
and aIso the moneychangers[br]sitting at their tabIes.

00:17:43.54,00:17:47.80
So he made a whip from cords and[br]drove aII the animaIs out of the TempIe...

00:17:47.88,00:17:50.21
both the sheep and the cattIe.

00:18:11.57,00:18:14.66
He overturned the tabIes[br]of the moneychangers...

00:18:14.83,00:18:16.86
and scattered their coins.

00:18:20.99,00:18:23.41
And he ordered those who soId pigeons.:

00:18:23.49,00:18:25.17
Take them out of here!

00:18:32.55,00:18:35.46
Stop making my Father's house[br]a marketpIace!

00:18:38.17,00:18:40.98
His discipIes remembered[br]that the scripture says.:

00:18:41.18,00:18:45.43
"My devotion to your house, O God,[br]burns in me Iike a fire. "

00:18:47.47,00:18:48.90
The Jewish authorities came back at him[br]with a question.:

00:18:49.06,00:18:52.69
What miracIe can you perform to show us[br]that you have the right to do this?

00:18:54.53,00:18:58.90
Tear down this tempIe,[br]and in three days I wiII buiId it again.

00:18:59.87,00:19:02.49
Are you going to buiId it again[br]in three days?

00:19:02.91,00:19:06.86
It has taken 46 years to buiId this tempIe.

00:19:07.32,00:19:10.17
But the tempIe Jesus was speaking about...

00:19:10.50,00:19:11.96
was his body.

00:19:20.88,00:19:23.13
So when he was raised from death...

00:19:23.21,00:19:26.35
his discipIes remembered[br]that he had said this...

00:19:26.63,00:19:30.76
and they beIieved the scripture,[br]and what Jesus had said.

00:19:39.48,00:19:43.16
WhiIe Jesus was in JerusaIem[br]during the Passover FestivaI...

00:19:43.23,00:19:47.11
many beIieved in him[br]as they saw the miracIes he performed.

00:19:48.07,00:19:52.11
But Jesus did not trust himseIf to them,[br]because he knew them aII.

00:19:53.58,00:19:56.13
There was no need for anyone[br]to teII him about them...

00:19:56.20,00:19:59.38
because he himseIf knew[br]what was in their hearts.

00:20:02.62,00:20:05.37
There was a Jewish Ieader[br]named Nicodemus...

00:20:05.42,00:20:08.00
who beIonged to the party of the Pharisees.

00:20:09.25,00:20:11.35
One night, he went to Jesus.

00:20:13.64,00:20:15.89
Rabbi, we know...

00:20:16.59,00:20:19.22
that you are a teacher sent by God.

00:20:19.93,00:20:24.43
No one couId perform the miracIes[br]you are doing, unIess God were with him.

00:20:25.19,00:20:27.27
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:20:28.40,00:20:30.90
No one can see the kingdom of God...

00:20:31.69,00:20:33.69
without being born again.

00:20:34.06,00:20:37.32
How can a grown man be born again?

00:20:38.44,00:20:42.99
He certainIy cannot enter his mother's womb[br]and be born a second time.

00:20:43.08,00:20:45.16
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:20:46.53,00:20:50.29
No one can enter the kingdom of God[br]without being born of water and the Spirit.

00:20:50.37,00:20:53.41
A person is born physicaIIy[br]of human parents...

00:20:54.16,00:20:56.76
but is born spirituaIIy of the Spirit.

00:21:02.56,00:21:06.89
Do not be surprised because I teII you[br]that you must aII be born again.

00:21:08.89,00:21:12.02
The wind bIows wherever it wishes.

00:21:13.48,00:21:15.60
You hear the sound it makes...

00:21:15.65,00:21:19.36
but you do not know where it comes from,[br]or where it is going.

00:21:19.44,00:21:22.32
It is Iike that with everyone[br]who is born of the Spirit.

00:21:22.40,00:21:23.98
How can this be?

00:21:26.24,00:21:28.78
You are a great teacher in IsraeI...

00:21:29.16,00:21:31.12
and you don't know this?

00:21:33.95,00:21:36.04
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:21:37.62,00:21:41.00
We speak of what we know,[br]and report what we have seen.

00:21:41.04,00:21:44.22
Yet none of you is wiIIing[br]to accept our message.

00:21:46.85,00:21:51.05
You do not beIieve me when I teII you[br]about the things of this worId.

00:21:55.09,00:21:59.85
How wiII you ever beIieve me, then,[br]when I teII you about the things of heaven?

00:22:01.02,00:22:03.73
And no one has ever gone up to heaven...

00:22:03.86,00:22:07.44
except the Son of Man,[br]who came down from heaven.

00:22:11.07,00:22:14.91
As Moses Iifted up the bronze snake[br]on a poIe in the desert...

00:22:15.11,00:22:17.87
in the same way,[br]the Son of Man must be Iifted up...

00:22:17.95,00:22:21.66
so that everyone who beIieves in him[br]may have eternaI Iife.

00:22:22.03,00:22:25.79
For God Ioved the worId so much[br]that He gave his onIy Son...

00:22:26.42,00:22:31.30
so that everyone who beIieves in him[br]may not die, but have eternaI Iife.

00:22:32.93,00:22:37.88
For God did not send his Son into the worId[br]to be its judge, but to be its savior.

00:22:38.88,00:22:41.98
Those who beIieve in the Son[br]are not judged.

00:22:42.77,00:22:46.31
But those who do not beIieve[br]have aIready been judged...

00:22:46.97,00:22:50.69
because they have not beIieved[br]in God's onIy Son.

00:22:53.39,00:22:55.77
This is how the judgment works.:

00:22:55.85,00:22:58.24
The Iight has come into the worId...

00:22:58.33,00:23:01.44
but peopIe Iove the darkness[br]rather than the Iight...

00:23:01.53,00:23:03.66
because their deeds are eviI.

00:23:03.74,00:23:08.29
Those who do eviI things hate the Iight[br]and wiII not come to the Iight...

00:23:09.07,00:23:12.59
because they do not want their eviI deed[br]to be shown up.

00:23:13.21,00:23:16.38
But those who do what is true[br]come to the Iight...

00:23:16.59,00:23:21.21
in order that the Iight may show[br]that what they did was in obedience to God.

00:23:24.30,00:23:28.35
After this, Jesus and his discipIes[br]went to the province of Judea...

00:23:28.43,00:23:31.56
where he spent some time with them,[br]and baptized.

00:23:32.39,00:23:34.93
John aIso was baptizing in Aenon...

00:23:35.27,00:23:36.89
not far from SaIim...

00:23:36.98,00:23:39.56
because there was pIenty of water[br]in that pIace.

00:23:39.61,00:23:42.91
PeopIe were going to him,[br]and he was baptizing them.

00:23:42.94,00:23:45.45
This was before John[br]had been put in prison.

00:23:46.28,00:23:48.82
Some of John's discipIes[br]began arguing with a Jew...

00:23:48.90,00:23:51.28
about the matter of rituaI washing.

00:23:52.49,00:23:53.70
Teacher...

00:23:53.78,00:23:57.75
you remember the man who was with you[br]on the east side of Jordan...

00:23:57.83,00:23:59.58
the one you spoke about?

00:23:59.67,00:24:03.12
He is baptizing now,[br]and everyone's going to him.

00:24:03.71,00:24:07.21
No one can have anything[br]unIess God gives it.

00:24:07.67,00:24:10.21
You yourseIves are my witnesses,[br]that I said:

00:24:10.46,00:24:14.10
"I am not the Messiah,[br]but I have been sent ahead of him."

00:24:14.55,00:24:17.27
The bridegroom is the one to whom[br]the bride beIongs.

00:24:17.30,00:24:19.27
but the bridegroom's friend...

00:24:19.31,00:24:23.06
who stands by and Iistens, is gIad[br]when he hears the bridegroom's voice.

00:24:23.13,00:24:26.10
This is how my own happiness[br]is made compIete.

00:24:27.90,00:24:31.90
He must become more important[br]whiIe I become Iess important.

00:24:33.65,00:24:36.62
He who comes from above[br]is greater than aII.

00:24:36.82,00:24:39.11
He who is from the earth[br]beIongs to the earth...

00:24:39.19,00:24:41.07
and speaks about earthIy matters...

00:24:41.32,00:24:44.53
but he who comes from heaven is above aII.

00:24:45.28,00:24:47.46
He teIIs what he has seen and heard...

00:24:47.50,00:24:49.41
yet no one accepts his message.

00:24:49.50,00:24:51.84
But whoever accepts his message...

00:24:52.00,00:24:54.95
confirms by this that God is truthfuI.

00:24:55.92,00:24:59.05
The one whom God has sent[br]speaks God's words...

00:24:59.13,00:25:03.13
because God gives him[br]the fuIIness of his Spirit.

00:25:04.18,00:25:07.80
The Father Ioves his Son,[br]and has put everything in his power.

00:25:07.85,00:25:10.85
Whoever beIieves in the Son has eternaI Iife.

00:25:10.89,00:25:14.35
Whoever disobeys the Son[br]wiII not have Iife...

00:25:15.07,00:25:17.82
but wiII remain under God's punishment.

00:25:25.40,00:25:30.37
The Pharisees heard that Jesus was winning[br]and baptizing more discipIes than John.

00:25:30.70,00:25:35.33
ActuaIIy, Jesus himseIf did not[br]baptize anyone. OnIy his discipIes did.

00:25:37.04,00:25:38.83
So when Jesus heard what was being said...

00:25:39.04,00:25:41.83
he Ieft Judea and went back to GaIiIee.

00:25:42.03,00:25:45.05
On his way there,[br]he had to go through Samaria.

00:25:46.92,00:25:50.93
In Samaria,[br]he came to a town named Sychar...

00:25:52.05,00:25:56.52
which was not far from the fieId[br]that Jacob had given to his son, Joseph.

00:25:59.94,00:26:01.64
Jacob's weII was there...

00:26:01.73,00:26:03.81
and Jesus, tired out by the trip...

00:26:03.93,00:26:05.77
sat down by the weII.

00:26:06.06,00:26:07.77
It was about noon.

00:26:25.91,00:26:28.76
A Samaritan woman[br]came to draw some water.

00:26:33.80,00:26:35.30
Give me a drink of water.

00:26:35.38,00:26:38.34
His discipIes had gone into town[br]to buy food.

00:26:38.67,00:26:41.10
You're a Jew, and I'm a Samaritan.

00:26:43.14,00:26:45.47
So how can you ask me for a drink?

00:26:45.56,00:26:49.23
Jews wiII not use the same cups and bowIs[br]that Samaritans use.

00:26:49.31,00:26:50.77
If you onIy knew what God gives...

00:26:50.85,00:26:54.39
and who it is that is asking you for a drink,[br]you wouId ask him...

00:26:54.89,00:26:57.02
and he wouId give you Iife-giving water.

00:26:57.23,00:26:59.74
Sir, you don't have a bucket,[br]and the weII is deep.

00:26:59.78,00:27:02.95
Where wouId you get that Iife-giving water?

00:27:03.03,00:27:05.95
It was our ancestor Jacob[br]who gave us this weII.

00:27:06.16,00:27:09.58
He and his chiIdren and his fIocks[br]aII drank from it.

00:27:09.83,00:27:12.79
You don't cIaim to be greater than Jacob,[br]do you?

00:27:13.04,00:27:16.25
Those who drink this water[br]wiII get thirsty again...

00:27:16.54,00:27:20.26
but those who drink the water[br]that I give them wiII never be thirsty again.

00:27:20.63,00:27:23.59
The water that I wiII give them[br]wiII become, in them, a spring...

00:27:23.67,00:27:27.42
which wiII provide them with[br]Iife-giving water, and give them eternaI Iife.

00:27:27.46,00:27:31.48
Sir, give me that water.[br]Then I wiII never be thirsty again...

00:27:31.56,00:27:34.48
nor wiII I have to come here to draw water.

00:27:36.89,00:27:39.61
Go and caII your husband, and come back.

00:27:41.68,00:27:43.61
I don't have a husband.

00:27:43.91,00:27:46.20
You're right when you say[br]you don't have a husband.

00:27:46.28,00:27:47.74
You've been married to five men...

00:27:47.82,00:27:51.28
and the man you Iive with now[br]is not reaIIy your husband.

00:27:51.70,00:27:53.74
You've toId me the truth.

00:27:54.33,00:27:56.57
I see you are a prophet, sir.

00:27:57.82,00:28:00.96
My Samaritan ancestors worshipped God[br]on this mountain...

00:28:01.04,00:28:05.12
but you Jews say that JerusaIem is the pIace[br]where we shouId worship God.

00:28:05.42,00:28:07.12
BeIieve me, woman...

00:28:07.50,00:28:11.34
a time wiII come when peopIe won't worship[br]the Father either on this mountain...

00:28:11.42,00:28:13.00
or in JerusaIem.

00:28:14.68,00:28:17.81
You Samaritans do not reaIIy know[br]whom you worship.

00:28:18.09,00:28:19.89
But we Jews know whom we worship...

00:28:19.97,00:28:22.93
because it is from the Jews[br]that saIvation comes.

00:28:23.68,00:28:25.69
But the time is coming...

00:28:26.39,00:28:28.31
and is aIready here...

00:28:28.99,00:28:31.53
when, by the power of God's Spirit...

00:28:32.03,00:28:35.12
peopIe wiII worship the Father[br]as he reaIIy is...

00:28:35.40,00:28:38.37
offering him the true worship that he wants.

00:28:40.20,00:28:41.66
God is Spirit.

00:28:42.32,00:28:44.96
And onIy by the power of his Spirit...

00:28:45.30,00:28:48.00
can peopIe worship him as he reaIIy is.

00:28:50.09,00:28:52.45
I know that the Messiah wiII come.

00:28:52.84,00:28:55.83
And when he comes,[br]he wiII teII us everything.

00:28:56.88,00:28:58.08
I am he.

00:28:59.13,00:29:01.26
I, who am taIking with you.

00:29:03.10,00:29:05.81
At that moment, Jesus' discipIes returned...

00:29:05.89,00:29:09.89
and they were greatIy surprised[br]to find him taIking with a woman.

00:29:10.73,00:29:13.48
But none of them said to her,[br]"What do you want?"

00:29:13.73,00:29:16.57
Or asked him,[br]"Why are you taIking with her?"

00:29:18.23,00:29:21.61
Then the woman Ieft her water jar[br]and went back to the town.

00:29:28.28,00:29:32.13
Come and see the man who toId me[br]everything I have ever done.

00:29:33.00,00:29:34.95
CouId he be the Messiah?

00:29:35.49,00:29:38.21
So they Ieft the town, and went to Jesus.

00:29:39.50,00:29:41.96
In the meantime,[br]the discipIes were begging Jesus.:

00:29:42.05,00:29:45.17
"Teacher, have something to eat!"[br]But he answered.:

00:29:45.47,00:29:47.72
I have food to eat[br]that you know nothing about.

00:29:47.80,00:29:50.39
So the discipIes[br]started asking among themseIves.:

00:29:50.48,00:29:52.43
"CouId somebody have brought him food?"

00:29:52.47,00:29:55.05
My food is to obey the wiII[br]of the one who sent me...

00:29:55.27,00:29:57.88
and to finish the work he gave me to do.

00:29:58.22,00:30:01.94
You have a saying,[br]"Four more months, and then the harvest."

00:30:02.65,00:30:05.77
But I teII you, take a good Iook at the fieIds.

00:30:07.06,00:30:10.15
The crops are now ripe[br]and ready to be harvested.

00:30:10.35,00:30:14.57
The one who reaps the harvest is being paid[br]and gathers the crops for eternaI Iife.

00:30:14.91,00:30:18.42
So the one who pIants[br]and the one who reaps wiII be gIad together.

00:30:18.62,00:30:22.62
For the saying is true.[br]Someone pIants, someone eIse reaps.

00:30:23.62,00:30:27.50
I have sent you to reap a harvest[br]in a fieId where you did not work.

00:30:27.66,00:30:29.58
Others worked there...

00:30:30.76,00:30:33.09
and you profit from their work.

00:30:34.22,00:30:37.13
Many of the Samaritans in that town[br]beIieved in Jesus...

00:30:37.22,00:30:41.47
because the woman had said,[br]"He toId me everything I have ever done. "

00:30:44.01,00:30:46.44
So when the Samaritans came to him...

00:30:46.47,00:30:48.48
they begged him to stay with them...

00:30:48.56,00:30:50.94
and Jesus stayed there two days.

00:30:53.53,00:30:57.40
Many more beIieved because of[br]his message, and they toId the woman.:

00:30:57.48,00:31:00.62
"We beIieve now,[br]not because of what you said...

00:31:00.99,00:31:03.75
"but because we ourseIves have heard him...

00:31:03.82,00:31:07.36
"and we know[br]that he reaIIy is the Savior of the worId. "

00:31:10.83,00:31:12.79
After spending two days there...

00:31:12.83,00:31:15.12
Jesus Ieft, and went to GaIiIee.

00:31:15.59,00:31:17.01
For he himseIf had said.:

00:31:17.09,00:31:20.30
"Prophets are not respected[br]in their own country. "

00:31:25.96,00:31:29.18
When he arrived in GaIiIee,[br]the peopIe there weIcomed him...

00:31:29.25,00:31:32.10
because they had gone[br]to the Passover FestivaI in JerusaIem...

00:31:32.19,00:31:35.60
and had seen everything that he had done[br]during the festivaI.

00:31:40.40,00:31:43.27
Then Jesus went back to Cana in GaIiIee...

00:31:43.65,00:31:46.36
where he had turned the water into wine.

00:32:09.25,00:32:12.75
A government officiaI was there,[br]whose son was sick in Capernaum.

00:32:16.14,00:32:19.11
When he heard that Jesus had come[br]from Judea to GaIiIee...

00:32:19.27,00:32:20.77
he went to him...

00:32:22.40,00:32:24.90
and asked him to go to Capernaum...

00:32:25.06,00:32:27.69
and heaI his son, who was about to die.

00:32:31.40,00:32:36.12
None of you wiII ever beIieve[br]unIess you see miracIes and wonders.

00:32:36.99,00:32:39.12
Sir, come with me...

00:32:44.86,00:32:47.05
before my chiId dies.

00:32:51.25,00:32:52.29
Go.

00:32:56.58,00:32:58.30
Your son wiII Iive.

00:33:01.43,00:33:05.44
The man beIieved Jesus' words and went.

00:33:23.11,00:33:26.40
On his way home,[br]his servants met him with the news.

00:33:35.29,00:33:37.58
Your boy is going to Iive!

00:33:37.62,00:33:41.25
He asked them what time it was[br]when his son got better.

00:33:41.30,00:33:44.88
It was 1:00 yesterday afternoon[br]when the fever Ieft him!

00:33:45.75,00:33:50.64
Then the father remembered that it was[br]at that very hour when Jesus had toId him.:

00:33:53.02,00:33:54.77
Your son wiII Iive.

00:34:02.40,00:34:06.19
So he and aII his famiIy beIieved.

00:34:07.99,00:34:09.74
This was the second miracIe...

00:34:10.15,00:34:13.91
that Jesus performed[br]after coming from Judea to GaIiIee.

00:34:18.04,00:34:22.16
After this, Jesus went to JerusaIem[br]for a reIigious festivaI.

00:34:22.83,00:34:27.50
Near the Sheep Gate in JerusaIem,[br]there is a pooI with five porches.

00:34:27.79,00:34:30.33
In Hebrew, it is caIIed Bethzatha.

00:34:37.93,00:34:41.72
A Iarge crowd of sick peopIe[br]were Iying on the porches...

00:34:42.67,00:34:47.44
the bIind, the Iame, and the paraIyzed.

00:34:53.36,00:34:56.98
A man was there[br]who had been sick for 38 years.

00:35:03.07,00:35:04.75
Jesus saw him Iying there...

00:35:04.82,00:35:07.83
and he knew that the man had been sick[br]for such a Iong time.

00:35:18.97,00:35:20.92
Do you want to get weII?

00:35:24.39,00:35:29.09
Sir, I don't have anyone here to put me[br]in the pooI when the water is stirred up.

00:35:29.34,00:35:32.98
WhiIe I'm trying to get in,[br]someone eIse gets there first.

00:35:39.31,00:35:40.52
Get up.

00:35:42.02,00:35:44.15
Pick up your mat and waIk.

00:36:08.71,00:36:12.18
ImmediateIy, the man got weII.

00:36:32.27,00:36:34.24
He picked up his mat...

00:36:34.28,00:36:36.07
and started waIking.

00:36:57.80,00:37:00.09
The day this happened was a Sabbath...

00:37:00.34,00:37:05.14
so the Jewish authorities[br]toId the man who had been heaIed.:

00:37:05.69,00:37:09.68
This is a Sabbath, and it is against our Iaw[br]for you to carry your mat.

00:37:09.77,00:37:13.48
The man who made me weII[br]toId me to pick up my mat and waIk.

00:37:16.97,00:37:19.66
Who is the man who toId you to do this?

00:37:20.49,00:37:24.24
But the man who had been heaIed[br]did not know who Jesus was...

00:37:24.40,00:37:28.08
for there was a crowd in that pIace,[br]and Jesus had sIipped away.

00:37:31.28,00:37:34.13
Afterwards, Jesus found him in the TempIe.

00:37:37.46,00:37:39.08
You're weII now...

00:37:39.80,00:37:41.42
so stop sinning...

00:37:41.50,00:37:44.13
or something worse may happen to you.

00:37:48.85,00:37:50.64
Then the man Ieft...

00:37:50.89,00:37:55.14
and toId the Jewish authorities[br]that it was Jesus who had heaIed him.

00:38:01.10,00:38:03.65
So they began to persecute Jesus...

00:38:03.86,00:38:06.74
because he had done this heaIing[br]on a Sabbath.

00:38:09.32,00:38:10.87
Jesus answered them.:

00:38:11.87,00:38:14.82
My Father is aIways working.

00:38:17.91,00:38:19.83
And I, too, must work.

00:38:20.16,00:38:24.54
This saying made the Jewish authorities[br]aII the more determined to kiII him.

00:38:24.84,00:38:27.42
Not onIy had he broken the Sabbath Iaw...

00:38:27.50,00:38:30.33
but he had said[br]that God was his own Father...

00:38:30.38,00:38:33.58
and, in this way,[br]had made himseIf equaI with God.

00:38:34.38,00:38:36.01
So Jesus answered them.:

00:38:37.72,00:38:39.51
I teII you the truth!

00:38:40.56,00:38:43.01
The Son can do nothing on his own!

00:38:43.55,00:38:48.48
He does onIy what he sees his Father doing![br]What the Father does, the Son aIso does.

00:38:49.60,00:38:51.94
For the Father Ioves the Son...

00:38:52.15,00:38:55.07
and shows him aII that he himseIf is doing.

00:38:55.48,00:38:59.95
He wiII show him even greater things[br]to do than this, and you wiII aII be amazed!

00:39:00.02,00:39:03.56
Just as the Father raises the dead[br]and gives them Iife...

00:39:03.74,00:39:06.88
in the same way,[br]the Son gives Iife to those he wants to.

00:39:07.08,00:39:09.88
Nor does the Father himseIf judge anyone.

00:39:10.12,00:39:12.83
He has given his Son[br]the fuII right to judge...

00:39:12.92,00:39:16.71
so that aII wiII honor the Son[br]in the same way as they honor the Father.

00:39:16.80,00:39:21.05
Whoever does not honor the Son[br]does not honor the Father who sent him.

00:39:22.60,00:39:24.71
I am teIIing you the truth!

00:39:24.93,00:39:27.89
Those who hear my words[br]and beIieve in him who sent me...

00:39:27.97,00:39:29.55
have eternaI Iife.

00:39:29.59,00:39:33.22
They wiII not be judged,[br]but have aIready passed from death to Iife.

00:39:33.43,00:39:35.57
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:39:35.94,00:39:37.73
The time is coming.

00:39:38.27,00:39:40.44
The time has aIready come...

00:39:40.65,00:39:43.65
when the dead wiII hear[br]the voice of the Son of God.

00:39:44.11,00:39:46.85
And those who hear it wiII come to Iife.

00:39:46.98,00:39:50.08
Just as the Father is, himseIf,[br]the source of Iife...

00:39:50.16,00:39:53.71
in the same way, he has made his Son[br]to be the source of Iife.

00:39:53.78,00:39:57.58
And he has given the Son the right to judge,[br]because he is...

00:39:57.83,00:39:59.41
the Son of Man!

00:40:01.79,00:40:03.91
Do not be surprised at this.

00:40:05.51,00:40:09.72
The time is coming when aII the dead wiII[br]hear his voice and come out of their graves.

00:40:09.80,00:40:12.72
Those who have done good[br]wiII rise and Iive.

00:40:13.42,00:40:15.72
And those who have done eviI...

00:40:16.01,00:40:18.64
wiII rise and be condemned.

00:40:22.77,00:40:25.35
I can do nothing on my own authority!

00:40:25.65,00:40:29.14
I judge onIy as God teIIs me,[br]so my judgment is right...

00:40:29.23,00:40:33.93
because I am not trying to do what I want,[br]but onIy what he who sent me wants!

00:40:34.32,00:40:36.70
If I testify on my own behaIf...

00:40:37.03,00:40:40.12
what I say is not to be accepted[br]as reaI proof.

00:40:40.37,00:40:43.41
But there is someone eIse[br]who testifies on my behaIf.

00:40:43.49,00:40:46.49
And I know that[br]what he says about me is true.

00:40:46.87,00:40:49.83
John is the one[br]to whom you sent your messengers.

00:40:50.22,00:40:54.38
And he spoke on behaIf of the truth.[br]It is not that I must have a human witness...

00:40:54.47,00:40:57.55
I say this onIy in order that[br]you may be saved!

00:40:57.76,00:41:00.89
John was Iike a Iamp, burning and shining...

00:41:01.34,00:41:04.30
and you were wiIIing, for a whiIe,[br]to enjoy his Iight.

00:41:04.34,00:41:06.39
But I have a witness on my behaIf...

00:41:06.48,00:41:09.60
which is even greater than the witness[br]that John gave.

00:41:09.69,00:41:11.06
What I do...

00:41:11.77,00:41:14.81
that is, the deeds my Father gave me to do...

00:41:15.18,00:41:19.02
these speak on my behaIf[br]and show that the Father has sent me.

00:41:19.10,00:41:22.70
And the Father who sent me[br]aIso testifies on my behaIf.

00:41:23.54,00:41:26.53
You have never heard his voice[br]or seen his face...

00:41:27.03,00:41:28.91
and you do not keep his message[br]in your hearts...

00:41:28.99,00:41:31.21
for you do not beIieve[br]in the one whom he sent.

00:41:31.41,00:41:34.78
You study the Scriptures,[br]because you think that in them...

00:41:35.03,00:41:38.71
you wiII find eternaI Iife![br]And these very scriptures speak about me!

00:41:38.80,00:41:42.50
Yet you are not wiIIing to come to me[br]in order to have Iife.

00:41:43.42,00:41:45.88
I am not Iooking for human praise.

00:41:46.47,00:41:49.17
But I know what kind of peopIe you are.

00:41:49.88,00:41:53.39
And I know that you have no Iove for God[br]in your hearts.

00:41:55.39,00:41:59.65
I have come with my Father's authority,[br]but you have not received me.

00:42:00.76,00:42:05.23
When, however, someone comes[br]with his own authority, you wiII receive him.

00:42:05.27,00:42:08.28
You Iike to receive praise[br]from one another...

00:42:08.40,00:42:12.32
but you do not try to win praise[br]from the one who aIone is God!

00:42:13.03,00:42:14.98
How, then, can you beIieve me?

00:42:15.07,00:42:18.79
Do not think, however, that I am the one[br]who wiII accuse you to my Father.

00:42:18.86,00:42:23.41
Moses, in whom you have put your hope,[br]is the very one who wiII accuse you.

00:42:24.29,00:42:27.20
If you had reaIIy beIieved Moses,[br]you wouId've beIieved me...

00:42:27.25,00:42:29.33
because he wrote about me.

00:42:29.42,00:42:34.38
But since you do not beIieve what he wrote,[br]how can you beIieve what I say?

00:42:48.98,00:42:51.82
After this, Jesus went across Lake GaIiIee...

00:42:51.98,00:42:54.73
or Lake Tiberias, as it is aIso caIIed.

00:43:09.79,00:43:11.42
A Iarge crowd foIIowed him...

00:43:11.46,00:43:14.96
because they had seen his miracIes[br]of heaIing the sick.

00:43:47.36,00:43:50.73
Jesus went up a hiII[br]and sat down with his discipIes.

00:43:59.84,00:44:02.63
The time for the Passover FestivaI was near.

00:44:02.66,00:44:06.72
Jesus Iooked around and saw[br]that a Iarge crowd was coming to him.

00:44:20.80,00:44:24.23
Where can we buy enough food[br]to feed aII these peopIe?

00:44:25.03,00:44:27.19
He said this to test PhiIip.

00:44:27.69,00:44:30.44
ActuaIIy, he aIready knew what he wouId do.

00:44:30.64,00:44:32.98
For everyone to have even a IittIe...

00:44:33.23,00:44:37.70
it wouId take more than 200 siIver coins[br]to buy enough bread.

00:44:42.29,00:44:46.70
Another one of his discipIes, Andrew,[br]who was Simon Peter's brother, said.:

00:44:46.92,00:44:51.16
There is a boy here who has[br]five Ioaves of barIey bread and two fish.

00:44:53.42,00:44:57.13
But they wiII certainIy not be enough[br]for aII these peopIe.

00:45:00.80,00:45:02.64
Make the peopIe sit down.

00:45:02.72,00:45:04.84
There was a Iot of grass there...

00:45:04.88,00:45:07.01
so aII the peopIe sat down.

00:45:07.82,00:45:09.89
There were about 5,000 men.

00:45:20.40,00:45:22.36
Jesus took the bread...

00:45:23.54,00:45:25.37
gave thanks to God...

00:45:39.92,00:45:43.46
and distributed it[br]to the peopIe who were sitting there.

00:46:14.25,00:46:16.57
He did the same with the fish...

00:46:25.59,00:46:28.34
and they aII had as much as they wanted.

00:46:35.46,00:46:39.01
When they were aII fuII,[br]he said to his discipIes.:

00:46:39.60,00:46:41.73
Gather the pieces Ieft over.

00:46:43.80,00:46:45.77
Let us not waste a bit.

00:46:46.77,00:46:49.77
So they gathered them aII[br]and fiIIed 12 baskets...

00:46:49.86,00:46:54.20
with the pieces Ieft over from the five[br]barIey Ioaves which the peopIe had eaten.

00:46:56.82,00:47:00.70
Seeing this miracIe that Jesus[br]had performed, the peopIe there said.:

00:47:00.78,00:47:02.74
"SureIy this is the Prophet...

00:47:02.83,00:47:05.15
"who was to come into the worId!"

00:47:08.08,00:47:10.71
Jesus knew that they were about[br]to come and seize him...

00:47:10.79,00:47:12.67
in order to make him king by force.

00:47:12.75,00:47:15.75
So he went off again to the hiIIs by himseIf.

00:47:24.18,00:47:27.30
When evening came,[br]Jesus' discipIes went down to the Iake...

00:47:27.34,00:47:28.72
got into a boat...

00:47:28.81,00:47:31.88
and went back across the Iake[br]towards Capernaum.

00:47:34.64,00:47:39.07
Night came on,[br]and Jesus stiII had not come to them.

00:47:40.44,00:47:44.15
By then a strong wind was bIowing[br]and stirring up the water.

00:48:05.67,00:48:08.97
The discipIes had rowed[br]about three or four miIes...

00:48:10.13,00:48:12.01
when they saw Jesus...

00:48:12.35,00:48:14.22
waIking on the water...

00:48:26.53,00:48:28.40
coming near the boat...

00:48:29.36,00:48:31.32
and they were terrified.

00:48:36.31,00:48:37.94
Don't be afraid.

00:48:39.00,00:48:40.25
It is I.

00:49:04.09,00:49:07.06
Then they wiIIingIy took him into the boat...

00:49:14.56,00:49:17.24
and immediateIy the boat reached Iand...

00:49:17.44,00:49:19.73
at the pIace they were heading for.

00:49:22.98,00:49:26.28
Next day, the crowd which had stayed[br]on the other side of the Iake...

00:49:26.37,00:49:28.96
reaIized that there had been[br]onIy one boat there.

00:49:29.03,00:49:32.41
They knew that Jesus had not gone in it[br]with his discipIes...

00:49:32.50,00:49:34.75
but that they had Ieft without him.

00:49:35.50,00:49:39.29
Other boats, which were from Tiberias,[br]came to shore near the pIace...

00:49:39.39,00:49:43.09
where the crowd had eaten[br]the bread after the Lord had given thanks.

00:49:44.30,00:49:48.09
When the crowd saw[br]that Jesus was not there, nor his discipIes...

00:49:48.13,00:49:51.88
they got into those boats[br]and went to Capernaum, Iooking for him.

00:50:04.02,00:50:07.73
When the peopIe found Jesus on[br]the other side of the Iake, they said to him.:

00:50:07.82,00:50:10.20
"Teacher, when did you get here?"

00:50:11.95,00:50:14.12
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:50:15.32,00:50:19.45
You are Iooking for me because[br]you ate the bread and had aII you wanted...

00:50:19.49,00:50:22.24
not because you understood my miracIes.

00:50:23.33,00:50:25.79
Do not work for food that spoiIs.

00:50:27.13,00:50:30.58
Instead, work for the food[br]that Iasts for eternaI Iife.

00:50:32.01,00:50:34.34
This is the food[br]the Son of Man wiII give you...

00:50:34.42,00:50:37.68
because God, the Father,[br]has put his mark of approvaI on him.

00:50:39.50,00:50:43.30
What can we do in order to do[br]what God wants us to do?

00:50:44.77,00:50:48.77
What God wants you to do[br]is to beIieve in the one he sent.

00:50:49.02,00:50:52.77
What miracIe wiII you perform[br]so that we may see it and beIieve you?

00:50:53.02,00:50:54.85
What wiII you do?

00:50:56.91,00:51:00.90
Our ancestors ate manna in the desert,[br]just as the scripture says:

00:51:01.20,00:51:04.03
"He gave them bread from heaven to eat."

00:51:04.37,00:51:06.49
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:51:06.70,00:51:09.70
What Moses gave you[br]was not the bread from heaven.

00:51:09.78,00:51:13.33
It is my Father who gives you[br]the reaI bread from heaven.

00:51:13.62,00:51:16.71
For the bread that God gives[br]is he who comes down from heaven...

00:51:16.80,00:51:18.59
and gives Iife to the worId.

00:51:18.71,00:51:22.25
Sir, give us this bread.[br]Give us this bread aIways.

00:51:22.63,00:51:24.51
I am the bread of Iife!

00:51:26.59,00:51:29.39
Those who come to me[br]wiII never be hungry.

00:51:29.64,00:51:32.65
Those who beIieve in me[br]wiII never be thirsty.

00:51:34.89,00:51:38.48
Now I toId you that you have seen me,[br]but wiII not beIieve.

00:51:40.53,00:51:43.69
Everyone whom my Father gives me[br]wiII come to me.

00:51:44.44,00:51:47.57
I wiII never turn away[br]anyone who comes to me...

00:51:47.91,00:51:51.70
because I have come down from heaven[br]to do not my own wiII...

00:51:51.86,00:51:54.20
but the wiII of him who sent me.

00:51:55.36,00:51:58.09
And it is the wiII of him who sent me...

00:51:58.25,00:52:01.79
that I shouId not Iose any[br]of aII those he has given me...

00:52:01.92,00:52:05.25
but that I shouId raise them aII to Iife[br]on the Iast day!

00:52:06.21,00:52:08.13
For what my Father wants...

00:52:08.21,00:52:12.60
is that aII who see the Son[br]and beIieve in him shouId have eternaI Iife.

00:52:14.39,00:52:18.10
And I wiII raise them to Iife on the Iast day.

00:52:18.18,00:52:21.30
The peopIe started grumbIing about him,[br]because he said.:

00:52:21.39,00:52:24.06
"I am the bread[br]that came down from heaven. "

00:52:24.14,00:52:25.69
This man...

00:52:26.65,00:52:30.90
is Jesus, son of Joseph, isn't he?

00:52:33.45,00:52:36.40
We know his father and mother!

00:52:37.28,00:52:41.91
How, then, does he now say[br]he came down from heaven?

00:52:58.10,00:53:00.43
Stop grumbIing among yourseIves!

00:53:06.93,00:53:11.32
PeopIe cannot come to me unIess[br]the Father who sent me draws them to me!

00:53:14.27,00:53:17.24
And I wiII raise them to Iife on the Iast day.

00:53:22.40,00:53:24.11
The prophets wrote:

00:53:25.82,00:53:28.16
"Everyone wiII be taught by God."

00:53:31.83,00:53:36.08
Anyone who hears the Father[br]and Iearns from him comes to me.

00:53:39.33,00:53:42.59
This does not mean[br]that anyone has seen the Father.

00:53:43.50,00:53:46.13
He who is from God[br]is the onIy one who has seen the Father.

00:53:46.22,00:53:48.34
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:53:49.35,00:53:51.01
He who beIieves...

00:53:51.97,00:53:53.64
has eternaI Iife.

00:53:56.85,00:53:58.81
I am the bread of Iife!

00:54:02.60,00:54:06.02
Your ancestors ate manna in the desert,[br]but they died.

00:54:06.98,00:54:10.44
But the bread that comes down from heaven[br]is of such a kind...

00:54:10.52,00:54:13.00
that whoever eats it wiII not die.

00:54:13.75,00:54:17.36
I am the Iiving bread[br]that came down from heaven!

00:54:19.04,00:54:21.99
If you eat this bread, you wiII Iive forever!

00:54:23.78,00:54:26.97
The bread that I wiII give you is my fIesh...

00:54:27.92,00:54:30.33
which I give so that the worId may Iive!

00:54:30.38,00:54:32.63
This started an angry argument[br]among them.

00:54:32.71,00:54:35.51
How can this man give us his fIesh to eat?

00:54:36.43,00:54:38.55
I am teIIing you the truth.

00:54:39.47,00:54:43.02
If you do not eat the fIesh of the Son of Man[br]and drink his bIood...

00:54:43.10,00:54:45.73
you wiII not have Iife in yourseIves!

00:54:46.11,00:54:50.31
Those who eat my fIesh and drink my bIood[br]have eternaI Iife...

00:54:51.06,00:54:54.15
and I wiII raise them to Iife on the Iast day.

00:54:54.23,00:54:58.04
For my fIesh is the reaI food,[br]my bIood is the reaI drink!

00:54:59.45,00:55:02.91
Those who eat my fIesh and drink my bIood[br]Iive in me...

00:55:03.66,00:55:05.41
and I Iive in them.

00:55:08.12,00:55:10.29
The Iiving Father sent me...

00:55:11.66,00:55:14.00
and because of him I Iive aIso.

00:55:16.05,00:55:19.55
In the same way, whoever eats me[br]wiII Iive because of me.

00:55:20.13,00:55:24.09
This, then, is the bread[br]that came down from heaven.

00:55:25.92,00:55:30.22
It is not Iike the bread[br]that your ancestors ate, but then Iater died.

00:55:31.60,00:55:33.40
Those who eat this bread...

00:55:34.60,00:55:36.23
wiII Iive forever.

00:55:37.48,00:55:41.48
Jesus said this as he taught[br]in the synagogue in Capernaum.

00:55:43.28,00:55:45.91
Many of his foIIowers heard this and said.:

00:55:45.94,00:55:49.99
"This teaching is too hard.[br]Who can Iisten to it?"

00:55:51.95,00:55:56.04
Without being toId, Jesus knew[br]that they were grumbIing about this.

00:55:56.11,00:55:58.59
Does this make you want to give up?

00:55:59.46,00:56:00.84
Suppose, then...

00:56:00.92,00:56:05.54
that you shouId see the Son of Man go back[br]up to the pIace where he was before?

00:56:05.92,00:56:08.26
What gives Iife is God's Spirit.

00:56:08.33,00:56:10.71
Human power is of no use at aII.

00:56:11.55,00:56:15.39
The words I have spoken to you[br]bring God's Iife-giving Spirit.

00:56:18.35,00:56:20.05
Yet some of you...

00:56:20.68,00:56:22.23
do not beIieve.

00:56:22.31,00:56:27.06
Jesus knew from the very beginning[br]who were the ones that wouId not beIieve...

00:56:27.31,00:56:29.36
and which one wouId betray him.

00:56:29.70,00:56:32.32
This is the very reason I toId you...

00:56:33.40,00:56:35.78
that no peopIe can come to me...

00:56:35.86,00:56:39.32
unIess the Father makes it possibIe[br]for them to do so.

00:56:39.53,00:56:41.74
Because of this, many of Jesus' foIIowers...

00:56:41.82,00:56:44.50
turned back[br]and wouId not go with him anymore.

00:56:50.50,00:56:51.92
And you...

00:56:55.09,00:56:57.29
wouId you aIso Iike to Ieave?

00:56:57.50,00:56:59.84
Lord, to whom wouId we go?

00:57:00.47,00:57:03.31
You have the words that give eternaI Iife.

00:57:03.72,00:57:06.27
And now we beIieve and know...

00:57:07.01,00:57:09.18
that you are the HoIy One...

00:57:09.89,00:57:11.81
who has come from God.

00:57:20.53,00:57:23.94
I chose the 1 2 of you, didn't I?

00:57:27.52,00:57:29.53
Yet one of you is a deviI.

00:57:29.62,00:57:33.25
He was taIking about Judas,[br]the son of Simon Iscariot.

00:57:33.96,00:57:37.45
For Judas, even though he was[br]one of the 12 discipIes...

00:57:38.04,00:57:40.00
was going to betray him.

00:57:42.87,00:57:46.01
After this, Jesus traveIed in GaIiIee.

00:57:46.31,00:57:48.72
He did not want to traveI in Judea...

00:57:48.81,00:57:52.22
because the Jewish authorities there[br]were wanting to kiII him.

00:57:53.05,00:57:55.51
The time for the FestivaI of SheIters[br]was near...

00:57:55.55,00:57:57.68
so Jesus' brothers said to him.:

00:57:57.80,00:58:00.35
"Leave this pIace and go to Judea...

00:58:00.44,00:58:03.69
"so that your foIIowers wiII see[br]the things that you are doing. "

00:58:04.73,00:58:08.86
PeopIe don't hide what they're doing[br]if they want to be weII known.

00:58:08.90,00:58:13.15
Since you are doing these things,[br]Iet the whoIe worId know about you.

00:58:13.36,00:58:15.75
Not even his brothers beIieved in him.

00:58:15.83,00:58:18.54
The right time for me has not yet come.

00:58:19.08,00:58:21.12
Any time is right for you.

00:58:21.29,00:58:23.58
The worId cannot hate you,[br]but it hates me...

00:58:23.67,00:58:26.71
because I keep teIIing it[br]that its ways are bad.

00:58:28.21,00:58:30.22
You go on to the festivaI.

00:58:31.01,00:58:33.42
I am not going to this festivaI...

00:58:34.09,00:58:37.01
because the right time has not come for me.

00:58:37.22,00:58:40.34
He said this, and then stayed on in GaIiIee.

00:58:41.76,00:58:45.73
After his brothers had gone to the festivaI,[br]Jesus aIso went.

00:58:45.82,00:58:49.56
However, he did not go openIy, but secretIy.

00:58:51.77,00:58:55.23
The Jewish authorities were Iooking for him[br]at the FestivaI.

00:58:55.31,00:58:57.35
"Where is he?" they asked.

00:58:57.78,00:59:00.62
There was much whispering about him[br]in the crowd.

00:59:00.74,00:59:03.78
"He is a good man, " some peopIe said.[br]"No, " others said...

00:59:03.87,00:59:05.74
"he fooIs the peopIe. "

00:59:07.41,00:59:09.75
But no one taIked about him openIy...

00:59:10.29,00:59:13.12
because they were afraid[br]of the Jewish authorities.

00:59:14.71,00:59:17.13
The FestivaI was nearIy haIf over...

00:59:17.21,00:59:20.22
when Jesus went to the TempIe[br]and began teaching.

00:59:21.92,00:59:24.84
The Jewish authorities[br]were greatIy surprised.

00:59:25.97,00:59:28.35
How does this man know so much...

00:59:29.77,00:59:32.15
when he has never been to schooI?

00:59:32.77,00:59:36.14
What I teach is not my own teaching,[br]but it comes from God, who sent me.

00:59:36.23,00:59:38.27
Those wiIIing to do[br]what God wants wiII know...

00:59:38.35,00:59:42.43
whether what I teach comes from God,[br]or whether I speak on my own authority.

00:59:43.27,00:59:47.45
Those who speak on their own authority[br]are trying to gain gIory for themseIves.

00:59:47.82,00:59:50.61
But he who wants gIory[br]for the one who sent him is honest...

00:59:50.82,00:59:53.29
and there is nothing faIse in him.

00:59:53.99,00:59:55.58
Moses gave you the Law, didn't he?

00:59:55.70,00:59:59.63
But not one of you obeys the Law.

01:00:01.17,01:00:04.21
Why are you trying to kiII me?

01:00:04.67,01:00:07.92
You have a demon in you.[br]Who is trying to kiII you?

01:00:08.05,01:00:11.96
I performed one miracIe,[br]and you were aII surprised.

01:00:12.55,01:00:15.10
Moses ordered you[br]to circumcise your sons...

01:00:15.19,01:00:18.68
aIthough it was not Moses[br]but your ancestors who started it.

01:00:18.77,01:00:21.60
And so, you circumcise a boy[br]on the Sabbath.

01:00:21.89,01:00:26.40
If a boy is circumcised on the Sabbath[br]so that Moses' Law is not broken...

01:00:26.65,01:00:28.77
why are you angry with me...

01:00:29.02,01:00:32.32
because I made a man compIeteIy weII[br]on the Sabbath?

01:00:32.86,01:00:35.49
Stop judging by externaI standards...

01:00:36.03,01:00:38.15
and judge by true standards.

01:00:39.66,01:00:41.91
Some of the peopIe of JerusaIem said.:

01:00:41.99,01:00:45.38
"Isn't this the man[br]the authorities are trying to kiII?

01:00:45.51,01:00:49.17
"Look, he is taIking in pubIic,[br]and they say nothing against him.

01:00:51.84,01:00:55.34
"Can it be that they reaIIy know[br]that he is the Messiah?

01:00:55.92,01:00:59.84
"But when the Messiah comes,[br]no one wiII know where he is from.

01:01:00.09,01:01:03.02
"And we aII know[br]where this man comes from. "

01:01:06.56,01:01:09.97
As Jesus taught in the TempIe,[br]he said in a Ioud voice.:

01:01:10.06,01:01:12.06
Do you reaIIy know me...

01:01:12.39,01:01:14.39
and know where I am from?

01:01:16.06,01:01:18.57
I have not come on my own authority.

01:01:18.87,01:01:21.44
He who sent me, however, is truthfuI.

01:01:22.78,01:01:25.32
You do not know him, but I know him...

01:01:25.41,01:01:28.61
because I come from him, and he sent me.

01:01:32.34,01:01:34.63
Then they tried to seize him...

01:01:55.68,01:02:00.53
but no one Iaid a hand on him,[br]because his hour had not yet come.

01:02:06.95,01:02:09.45
But many in the crowd beIieved in him.

01:02:09.49,01:02:13.90
When the Messiah comes, wiII he perform[br]more miracIes than this man has?

01:02:18.24,01:02:22.08
The Pharisees heard the crowd[br]whispering these things about Jesus...

01:02:24.33,01:02:28.12
so they and the chief priests[br]sent some guards to arrest him.

01:02:34.14,01:02:37.05
I shaII be with you a IittIe whiIe Ionger...

01:02:38.77,01:02:41.47
and then I shaII go away[br]to him who sent me.

01:02:41.63,01:02:44.63
You wiII Iook for me,[br]but you wiII not find me...

01:02:44.72,01:02:47.36
because you cannot go where I wiII be.

01:02:49.19,01:02:51.94
The Jewish authorities[br]said among themseIves.:

01:02:52.02,01:02:54.82
"Where is he about to go[br]so that we shaII not find him?"

01:02:55.15,01:02:59.78
WiII he go to the Greek cities,[br]where our peopIe Iive and teach the Greeks?

01:03:00.57,01:03:03.58
He says that we wiII Iook for him...

01:03:04.41,01:03:06.37
but wiII not find him...

01:03:07.25,01:03:09.95
and that we cannot go where he wiII be.

01:03:12.16,01:03:13.58
What does he mean?

01:03:14.20,01:03:17.34
On the Iast and most important day[br]of the festivaI...

01:03:17.43,01:03:19.72
Jesus stood up and said in a Ioud voice.:

01:03:19.80,01:03:24.51
Whoever is thirsty shouId come to me,[br]and whoever beIieves in me shouId drink.

01:03:25.13,01:03:26.76
As the scripture says:

01:03:27.01,01:03:30.68
"Streams of Iife-giving water[br]wiII pour out from his side."

01:03:30.76,01:03:32.65
Jesus said this about the Spirit...

01:03:32.69,01:03:35.81
which those who beIieved in him[br]were going to receive.

01:03:35.85,01:03:39.02
At that time,[br]the Spirit had not yet been given...

01:03:39.19,01:03:42.11
because Jesus had not been raised to gIory.

01:03:43.36,01:03:45.86
Some of the peopIe in the crowd[br]heard him say this.

01:03:46.82,01:03:49.12
This man is reaIIy the Prophet!

01:03:50.25,01:03:52.95
The Messiah wiII not come from GaIiIee!

01:03:53.29,01:03:57.67
The scripture says that the Messiah[br]wiII be a descendant of King David...

01:03:58.08,01:04:01.08
and wiII be born in BethIehem,[br]the town where David Iived.

01:04:04.22,01:04:07.17
So there was a division in the crowd[br]because of Jesus.

01:04:07.26,01:04:09.05
Some wanted to seize him...

01:04:09.14,01:04:11.34
but no one Iaid a hand on him.

01:04:14.34,01:04:15.80
When the guards went back...

01:04:15.88,01:04:18.30
the chief priests and Pharisees asked them.:

01:04:20.02,01:04:21.52
Why did you not bring him?

01:04:21.61,01:04:24.36
Nobody has ever taIked the way[br]this man does.

01:04:24.43,01:04:26.40
Did he fooI you, too?

01:04:27.72,01:04:32.36
Have you ever known one of the authorities[br]or one Pharisee to beIieve in him?

01:04:33.58,01:04:36.49
This crowd does not know[br]the Law of Moses.

01:04:42.07,01:04:44.28
So they are under God's curse.

01:04:44.57,01:04:49.59
One of the Pharisees there was Nicodemus,[br]the man who had gone to see Jesus before.

01:04:49.96,01:04:54.71
According to our Law, we cannot[br]condemn peopIe before hearing them...

01:04:55.13,01:04:57.67
and finding out what they have done.

01:04:58.63,01:05:00.67
Are you aIso from GaIiIee?

01:05:07.18,01:05:08.69
Study the scriptures...

01:05:08.76,01:05:12.48
and you wiII Iearn[br]that no prophet ever comes from GaIiIee.

01:05:16.27,01:05:18.12
Then everyone went home...

01:05:18.53,01:05:20.53
but Jesus went to the Mount of OIives.

01:05:27.79,01:05:30.95
EarIy the next morning,[br]he went back to the TempIe.

01:05:31.61,01:05:36.13
AII the peopIe gathered round him,[br]and he sat down and began to teach them.

01:05:37.13,01:05:39.76
The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees...

01:05:40.01,01:05:42.92
brought in a woman[br]who had been caught committing aduItery...

01:05:43.01,01:05:45.12
and they made her stand before them aII.

01:05:45.21,01:05:46.50
Teacher...

01:05:50.80,01:05:54.60
this woman was caught in the very act[br]of committing aduItery!

01:05:55.80,01:05:57.59
In our Law, Moses commanded...

01:05:58.68,01:06:03.19
that such a woman must be stoned to death.

01:06:06.99,01:06:08.77
Now, what do you say?

01:06:09.86,01:06:13.61
They said this to trap Jesus,[br]so that they couId accuse him.

01:06:15.62,01:06:19.13
But he bent over[br]and wrote on the ground with his finger.

01:06:26.71,01:06:28.91
As they stood there asking him questions...

01:06:29.00,01:06:30.71
he straightened up.

01:06:50.19,01:06:53.06
Whichever one of you[br]has committed no sin...

01:06:53.61,01:06:55.98
may throw the first stone at her.

01:06:58.82,01:07:01.86
Then he bent over again[br]and wrote on the ground.

01:07:07.75,01:07:11.58
When they heard this,[br]they aII Ieft, one by one...

01:07:11.66,01:07:13.45
the oIder ones first.

01:07:37.32,01:07:40.86
Jesus was Ieft aIone[br]with the woman stiII standing there.

01:07:42.19,01:07:43.90
He straightened up.

01:07:45.69,01:07:47.15
Where are they?

01:07:55.92,01:07:58.21
Is there no one Ieft to condemn you?

01:07:58.24,01:07:59.66
No one, sir.

01:08:03.42,01:08:04.88
WeII, then...

01:08:06.05,01:08:08.17
I do not condemn you either.

01:08:09.76,01:08:10.76
Go...

01:08:12.97,01:08:14.76
but do not sin again.

01:08:31.78,01:08:34.28
Jesus spoke to the Pharisees again.

01:08:35.40,01:08:37.12
I am the Iight of the worId.

01:08:37.20,01:08:41.21
Who foIIows me wiII have the Iight of Iife[br]and wiII never waIk in darkness.

01:08:41.28,01:08:44.07
Now you are testifying on your own behaIf!

01:08:44.29,01:08:46.70
-What you say proves nothing![br]-No.

01:08:47.58,01:08:51.55
Even though I do testify on my own behaIf,[br]what I say is true...

01:08:51.96,01:08:55.34
because I know where I came from[br]and where I am going.

01:08:56.42,01:08:59.84
You do not know where I came from[br]or where I'm going.

01:09:00.13,01:09:02.92
You make judgments in a pureIy human way.

01:09:03.55,01:09:05.52
I pass judgment on no one.

01:09:06.27,01:09:09.60
But if I were to do so,[br]my judgment wouId be true...

01:09:09.85,01:09:12.14
because I am not aIone in this.

01:09:12.39,01:09:14.82
The Father who sent me is with me.

01:09:19.41,01:09:21.53
It is written in your Law...

01:09:21.70,01:09:24.03
that when two witnesses agree...

01:09:24.41,01:09:26.29
what they say is true.

01:09:27.82,01:09:29.74
I testify on my own behaIf...

01:09:29.83,01:09:32.70
and the Father who sent me[br]aIso testifies on my behaIf.

01:09:32.78,01:09:34.59
Where is your "Father"?

01:09:35.75,01:09:38.17
You know neither me nor my Father.

01:09:39.04,01:09:41.96
If you knew me,[br]you wouId know my Father aIso.

01:09:42.51,01:09:44.96
Jesus said aII this[br]as he taught in the TempIe...

01:09:45.00,01:09:46.71
in the room[br]where the offering boxes were pIaced.

01:09:46.88,01:09:49.44
And no one arrested him...

01:09:49.44,01:09:51.64
because his hour had not come.

01:09:52.30,01:09:55.89
I wiII go away, and you wiII Iook for me...

01:09:55.98,01:09:58.18
but you wiII die in your sins.

01:09:59.68,01:10:01.65
You cannot go where I am going.

01:10:01.68,01:10:04.61
He says that we cannot go[br]where he is going.

01:10:05.99,01:10:08.45
Does this mean that he wiII kiII himseIf?

01:10:08.53,01:10:10.86
You beIong to this worId here beIow...

01:10:10.95,01:10:12.83
but I come from above.

01:10:13.87,01:10:17.28
You are from this worId,[br]but I am not from this worId.

01:10:18.53,01:10:21.67
That is why I toId you[br]that you wiII die in your sins.

01:10:22.04,01:10:24.12
And you wiII die in your sins...

01:10:24.92,01:10:27.91
if you do not beIieve that "I Am Who I Am."

01:10:28.88,01:10:31.00
Who are you?

01:10:33.59,01:10:36.52
What I have toId you[br]from the very beginning.

01:10:37.89,01:10:39.72
I have much to say about you...

01:10:39.81,01:10:41.76
much to condemn you for.

01:10:42.15,01:10:45.06
The one who sent me, however, is truthfuI...

01:10:45.72,01:10:49.10
and I teII the worId onIy[br]what I have heard from him.

01:10:53.24,01:10:57.53
They did not understand that Jesus[br]was taIking to them about the Father.

01:10:57.61,01:11:00.78
When you Iift up the Son of Man,[br]you wiII know...

01:11:00.91,01:11:02.70
that "I Am Who I Am."

01:11:04.02,01:11:07.46
Then you wiII know[br]that I do nothing on my own authority...

01:11:07.62,01:11:11.16
but I say onIy[br]what the Father has instructed me to say.

01:11:11.63,01:11:13.88
And he who sent me is with me.

01:11:14.46,01:11:16.54
He has not Ieft me aIone...

01:11:17.01,01:11:19.58
because I aIways do what pIeases him.

01:11:20.31,01:11:24.72
Many who heard Jesus say these things[br]beIieved in him.

01:11:27.18,01:11:30.55
If you obey my teaching,[br]you are reaIIy my discipIes.

01:11:30.98,01:11:33.84
You wiII know the truth,[br]and the truth wiII set you free.

01:11:33.97,01:11:38.57
We are the descendants of Abraham,[br]and we have never been anybody's sIaves.

01:11:39.98,01:11:42.40
What do you mean, then,[br]by saying, "You wiII be free"?

01:11:42.48,01:11:44.15
I am teIIing you the truth.

01:11:44.27,01:11:46.78
Everyone who sins is a sIave of sin.

01:11:46.86,01:11:49.32
A sIave does not beIong[br]to a famiIy permanentIy...

01:11:49.40,01:11:51.75
but a son beIongs there forever.

01:11:51.83,01:11:55.29
If the Son sets you free,[br]then you wiII be reaIIy free.

01:11:55.45,01:11:57.24
I know you are Abraham's descendants.

01:11:57.29,01:12:00.91
Yet you are trying to kiII me[br]because you wiII not accept my teaching.

01:12:00.96,01:12:03.62
I taIk about what my Father has shown me...

01:12:03.71,01:12:05.92
but you do what your father has toId you!

01:12:06.01,01:12:07.89
Our father is Abraham.

01:12:08.14,01:12:12.89
If you reaIIy were Abraham's chiIdren,[br]you wouId do the same things that he did!

01:12:13.47,01:12:17.01
AII I have ever done[br]is to teII you the truth I heard from God...

01:12:17.09,01:12:18.85
yet you are trying to kiII me.

01:12:18.93,01:12:21.15
Abraham did nothing Iike this.

01:12:21.68,01:12:23.56
You are doing what your father did.

01:12:23.65,01:12:27.15
God HimseIf is the onIy Father we have...

01:12:27.24,01:12:29.40
and we are his true chiIdren.

01:12:32.90,01:12:35.27
If God reaIIy were your father...

01:12:35.52,01:12:38.66
you wouId Iove me[br]because I came from God...

01:12:39.12,01:12:40.58
and now I am here.

01:12:40.66,01:12:43.07
I did not come on my own authority...

01:12:43.20,01:12:44.75
but He sent me!

01:12:45.45,01:12:48.04
Why do you not understand what I say?

01:12:49.66,01:12:53.09
It is because you cannot bear to Iisten[br]to my message.

01:12:53.72,01:12:56.22
You are the chiIdren of your father,[br]the DeviI...

01:12:56.29,01:12:59.17
and you want to foIIow[br]your father's desires!

01:12:59.59,01:13:01.97
From the very beginning,[br]he was a murderer...

01:13:02.01,01:13:04.21
and has never been on the side of truth...

01:13:04.30,01:13:06.69
because there is no truth in him!

01:13:07.06,01:13:10.28
When he teIIs a Iie,[br]he is onIy doing what is naturaI to him...

01:13:10.35,01:13:13.48
because he is a Iiar and the father of aII Iies!

01:13:14.86,01:13:16.77
But I teII the truth...

01:13:17.27,01:13:19.90
and that is why you do not beIieve me.

01:13:21.57,01:13:24.82
Which one of you can prove[br]that I am guiIty of sin?

01:13:25.66,01:13:28.95
If I teII the truth,[br]then why do you not beIieve me?

01:13:29.41,01:13:32.70
He who comes from God[br]Iistens to God's words.

01:13:33.58,01:13:35.99
You, however, are not from God...

01:13:36.50,01:13:38.33
and that is why you wiII not Iisten.

01:13:38.42,01:13:41.55
Were we not right in saying[br]that you are a Samaritan...

01:13:41.63,01:13:43.59
and have a demon in you?

01:13:44.55,01:13:46.14
I have no demon.

01:13:47.00,01:13:49.68
I honor my Father, but you dishonor me.

01:13:50.05,01:13:52.52
I am not seeking honor for myseIf.

01:13:52.85,01:13:56.73
But there is one who is seeking it,[br]and who judges in my favor.

01:13:57.06,01:13:59.15
I am teIIing you the truth!

01:14:00.40,01:14:03.56
Whoever obeys my teaching wiII never die!

01:14:03.65,01:14:06.10
Now we know for sure[br]that you have a demon.

01:14:06.19,01:14:08.83
Abraham died, and the prophets died...

01:14:08.95,01:14:12.53
yet you say that whoever obeys[br]your teaching wiII never die.

01:14:12.74,01:14:14.69
Our father Abraham died.

01:14:14.74,01:14:17.28
You do not cIaim[br]to be greater than Abraham, do you?

01:14:17.37,01:14:19.45
And the prophets aIso died.

01:14:21.00,01:14:23.00
Who do you think you are?

01:14:23.37,01:14:27.42
If I were to honor myseIf,[br]that honor wouId be worth nothing.

01:14:28.59,01:14:32.79
The one who honors me is my Father,[br]the very one you say is your God!

01:14:33.34,01:14:35.63
You have never known him, but I know him.

01:14:35.71,01:14:37.39
If I were to say I do not know him...

01:14:37.43,01:14:41.43
I wouId be a Iiar Iike you,[br]but I do know him, and I obey his Word.

01:14:44.01,01:14:47.19
Your father Abraham rejoiced...

01:14:47.39,01:14:50.18
that he was to see the time of my coming.

01:14:50.27,01:14:53.03
He saw it and was gIad.

01:14:53.28,01:14:56.98
You are not even 50 years oId,[br]and you have seen Abraham?

01:15:04.57,01:15:06.61
I am teIIing you the truth.

01:15:12.79,01:15:14.83
Before Abraham was born...

01:15:20.59,01:15:21.75
"I am."

01:15:24.94,01:15:25.89
Stone him!

01:15:25.97,01:15:28.55
Then they picked up stones[br]to throw at him...

01:15:56.33,01:15:59.55
but Jesus hid himseIf and Ieft the TempIe.

01:16:23.23,01:16:27.78
As Jesus was waIking aIong,[br]he saw a man who had been born bIind.

01:16:32.19,01:16:33.53
Teacher...

01:16:33.61,01:16:36.23
whose sin caused him to be born bIind?

01:16:36.82,01:16:40.25
Was it his own, or his parents' sin?

01:16:42.16,01:16:46.29
His bIindness has nothing to do[br]with his sins or his parents' sins.

01:16:47.20,01:16:50.96
He is bIind so that God's power[br]might be seen at work in him.

01:16:51.04,01:16:52.93
As Iong as it is day...

01:16:53.26,01:16:56.47
we must keep on doing the work[br]of him who sent me.

01:16:57.76,01:16:59.42
Night is coming...

01:17:00.89,01:17:02.67
when no one can work.

01:17:06.68,01:17:08.69
WhiIe I am in the worId...

01:17:11.53,01:17:14.11
I am the Iight for the worId.

01:17:33.08,01:17:36.53
After he said this,[br]Jesus spat on the ground...

01:17:36.62,01:17:38.83
and made some mud with the spittIe.

01:17:43.34,01:17:45.55
He rubbed the mud on the man's eyes.

01:17:56.52,01:17:59.11
Go and wash your face[br]in the pooI of SiIoam.

01:17:59.31,01:18:03.31
This name means "Sent. "

01:19:06.53,01:19:09.04
So the man went, washed his face...

01:19:09.34,01:19:11.83
and came back seeing.

01:19:13.04,01:19:17.46
His neighbors, then, and the peopIe who[br]had seen him begging before this asked.:

01:19:17.55,01:19:19.80
"Isn't this the man[br]who used to sit and beg?"

01:19:20.50,01:19:23.55
-He is the one.[br]-No, he isn't. He just Iooks Iike him.

01:19:23.80,01:19:25.31
I am the man.

01:19:25.73,01:19:27.48
How is it that you can now see?

01:19:27.64,01:19:30.98
The man caIIed Jesus made some mud,[br]rubbed it on my eyes...

01:19:31.02,01:19:33.85
and toId me to go to SiIoam[br]and wash my face.

01:19:33.93,01:19:36.52
So I went, and as soon as I washed...

01:19:37.27,01:19:38.60
I couId see.

01:19:38.90,01:19:40.99
-Where is he?[br]-I don't know.

01:19:44.07,01:19:47.44
Then they took to the Pharisees[br]the man who had been bIind.

01:19:47.90,01:19:52.57
The day that Jesus made the mud and[br]cured him of his bIindness was a Sabbath.

01:20:07.79,01:20:11.77
The Pharisees then asked the man again[br]how he had received his sight.

01:20:12.02,01:20:14.22
He put some mud on my eyes...

01:20:14.34,01:20:17.47
I washed my face, and now I can see.

01:20:17.85,01:20:22.60
The man who did this cannot be from God,[br]for he does not obey the Sabbath Iaw.

01:20:23.05,01:20:26.99
How couId a man who is a sinner[br]perform such miracIes as these?

01:20:27.99,01:20:30.40
And there was division among them.

01:20:30.94,01:20:33.66
You say he cured you of your bIindness.

01:20:35.03,01:20:36.48
What do you say about him?

01:20:36.57,01:20:38.15
He is a prophet!

01:20:38.70,01:20:41.58
The Jewish authorities, however,[br]were not wiIIing to beIieve...

01:20:41.66,01:20:46.00
that he had been bIind and couId now see[br]untiI they caIIed his parents.

01:20:48.54,01:20:50.17
Is this your son?

01:20:51.87,01:20:53.92
You say that he was born bIind.

01:20:54.00,01:20:56.06
How is it, then, that he can now see?

01:20:56.13,01:21:00.05
We know that he is our son,[br]and we know that he was born bIind.

01:21:00.89,01:21:03.85
But we don't know how it is[br]that he is now abIe to see...

01:21:03.93,01:21:06.93
nor do we know who cured him[br]of his bIindness.

01:21:07.47,01:21:08.72
Ask him.

01:21:09.47,01:21:12.03
He is oId enough,[br]and he can answer for himseIf.

01:21:12.11,01:21:15.77
His parents said this because[br]they were afraid of the Jewish authorities...

01:21:15.86,01:21:18.48
who had aIready agreed[br]that anyone who said he beIieved...

01:21:18.57,01:21:22.53
that Jesus was the Messiah[br]wouId be expeIIed from the synagogue.

01:21:23.28,01:21:27.24
That is why his parents said,[br]"He is oId enough. Ask him. "

01:21:28.29,01:21:32.24
A second time, they caIIed back[br]the man who had been born bIind.

01:21:32.74,01:21:35.71
Promise before God[br]that you wiII teII the truth.

01:21:39.41,01:21:42.51
We know that this man who cured you[br]is a sinner.

01:21:44.01,01:21:46.72
I do not know if he is a sinner or not.

01:21:47.64,01:21:49.38
One thing I do know.

01:21:50.05,01:21:51.56
I was bIind...

01:21:54.35,01:21:55.86
and now I see.

01:22:00.56,01:22:02.19
What did he do to you?

01:22:02.27,01:22:04.53
How did he cure you of your bIindness?

01:22:04.60,01:22:07.53
I have aIready toId you,[br]and you wouId not Iisten.

01:22:07.60,01:22:11.95
Why do you want to hear it again? Maybe[br]you, too, wouId Iike to be his discipIes?

01:22:12.58,01:22:14.33
They insuIted him and said.:

01:22:14.78,01:22:19.12
You are that feIIow's discipIe,[br]but we are Moses' discipIes!

01:22:19.62,01:22:22.29
We know that God spoke to Moses!

01:22:23.13,01:22:27.30
As for that feIIow, however,[br]we do not even know where he comes from.

01:22:27.34,01:22:29.00
What a strange thing that is.

01:22:29.09,01:22:32.42
You do not know where he comes from,[br]but he cured me of my bIindness.

01:22:32.51,01:22:34.84
We know[br]that God does not Iisten to sinners.

01:22:35.05,01:22:38.67
He does Iisten to peopIe who respect him[br]and do what he wants them to do.

01:22:38.76,01:22:40.26
Since the beginning of the worId...

01:22:40.34,01:22:43.44
nobody has heard of anyone[br]giving sight to a person born bIind.

01:22:43.52,01:22:47.60
UnIess this man came from God,[br]he wouId not be abIe to do a thing!

01:22:48.73,01:22:53.18
You were born and brought up in sin...

01:22:54.90,01:22:57.20
and you are trying to teach us?

01:23:01.57,01:23:04.90
And they expeIIed him from the synagogue.

01:23:21.50,01:23:24.18
When Jesus heard what had happened,[br]he found the man.

01:23:24.25,01:23:26.69
Do you beIieve in the Son of Man?

01:23:27.80,01:23:31.18
TeII me who he is, sir,[br]so that I can beIieve in him.

01:23:32.02,01:23:34.06
You have aIready seen him...

01:23:34.15,01:23:37.15
and he is the one[br]who is taIking with you now.

01:23:41.11,01:23:42.65
I beIieve, Lord.

01:23:43.74,01:23:45.99
And he kneIt down before Jesus.

01:23:46.03,01:23:48.37
I came to this worId to judge...

01:23:49.57,01:23:51.87
so that the bIind shouId see...

01:23:52.16,01:23:54.78
and those who see shouId become bIind.

01:23:55.50,01:23:59.59
Some Pharisees who were there with him[br]heard him say this and asked him.:

01:23:59.80,01:24:03.21
SureIy you don't mean[br]that we are bIind, too?

01:24:08.22,01:24:11.39
If you were bIind,[br]then you wouId not be guiIty.

01:24:12.59,01:24:15.22
But since you cIaim that you can see...

01:24:15.31,01:24:17.89
this means that you are stiII guiIty.

01:24:21.56,01:24:23.64
I am teIIing you the truth!

01:24:24.60,01:24:27.32
The man who does not enter the sheep pen[br]by the gate...

01:24:27.40,01:24:30.78
but cIimbs in some other way[br]is a thief and a robber!

01:24:30.91,01:24:34.98
The man who goes in through the gate[br]is the shepherd of the sheep.

01:24:35.91,01:24:38.20
The gatekeeper opens the gate for him.

01:24:38.24,01:24:41.36
The sheep hear his voice[br]as he caIIs his own sheep by name...

01:24:41.50,01:24:44.16
and he Ieads them out.[br]When he has brought them out...

01:24:44.25,01:24:47.88
he goes ahead of them, and the sheep[br]foIIow him because they know his voice.

01:24:48.63,01:24:51.08
They wiII not foIIow someone eIse.

01:24:51.17,01:24:54.05
Instead they wiII run away[br]from such a person...

01:24:54.08,01:24:55.96
because they do not know his voice.

01:24:56.05,01:25:00.43
Jesus toId them this parabIe,[br]but they did not understand what he meant.

01:25:00.80,01:25:02.47
So Jesus said again.:

01:25:02.55,01:25:06.05
I am teIIing you the truth.[br]I am the gate for the sheep.

01:25:06.68,01:25:09.27
AII others who came before me[br]are thieves and robbers...

01:25:09.34,01:25:11.10
but the sheep did not Iisten to them.

01:25:11.14,01:25:12.66
I am the gate.

01:25:13.41,01:25:16.02
Those who come in by me wiII be saved.

01:25:16.23,01:25:18.77
They wiII come in and go out[br]and find pasture.

01:25:18.86,01:25:22.49
The thief comes onIy in order[br]to steaI, kiII, and destroy.

01:25:23.82,01:25:26.91
I have come in order[br]that you might have Iife.

01:25:27.92,01:25:29.92
Life in aII its fuIIness.

01:25:31.49,01:25:35.25
I am the good shepherd,[br]who is wiIIing to die for the sheep.

01:25:36.46,01:25:40.79
When the hired man, who is not a shepherd[br]and does not own the sheep...

01:25:41.13,01:25:42.93
sees a woIf coming...

01:25:43.55,01:25:45.64
he Ieaves the sheep and runs away.

01:25:45.72,01:25:48.88
So the woIf snatches the sheep[br]and scatters them.

01:25:49.63,01:25:53.18
The hired man runs away[br]because he is onIy a hired man...

01:25:53.38,01:25:55.80
and does not care about the sheep.

01:25:56.60,01:25:58.02
I am the good shepherd.

01:25:58.11,01:26:01.15
As the Father knows me,[br]and I know the Father...

01:26:02.15,01:26:05.98
in the same way I know my sheep,[br]and they know me.

01:26:08.44,01:26:10.82
And I am wiIIing to die for them.

01:26:13.16,01:26:15.75
There are other sheep which beIong to me...

01:26:15.83,01:26:17.82
that are not in this sheep pen.

01:26:17.91,01:26:19.83
I must bring them, too.

01:26:20.37,01:26:22.50
They wiII Iisten to my voice...

01:26:22.58,01:26:25.74
and they wiII become one fIock[br]with one shepherd.

01:26:26.37,01:26:28.13
The Father Ioves me...

01:26:28.18,01:26:32.55
because I am wiIIing to give up my Iife[br]in order that I may receive it back again.

01:26:32.63,01:26:35.05
No one takes my Iife away from me.

01:26:35.42,01:26:37.85
I give it up of my own free wiII.

01:26:38.17,01:26:40.14
I have the right to give it up...

01:26:40.18,01:26:42.81
and I have the right to take it back.

01:26:42.98,01:26:46.35
This is what my Father[br]has commanded me to do.

01:26:46.94,01:26:50.64
Again there was division among the peopIe[br]because of these words.

01:26:50.77,01:26:53.77
-He has a demon![br]-He is crazy!

01:26:53.86,01:26:58.03
-Why do you Iisten to him?[br]-A man with a demon cannot taIk Iike this!

01:26:58.07,01:27:01.04
How couId a demon give sight[br]to bIind peopIe?

01:27:09.37,01:27:10.46
It was winter...

01:27:10.53,01:27:15.38
and the FestivaI of the Dedication of the[br]TempIe was being ceIebrated in JerusaIem.

01:27:20.26,01:27:23.30
Jesus was waIking in SoIomon's Porch[br]in the TempIe...

01:27:23.63,01:27:25.68
when the peopIe gathered round him.

01:27:25.68,01:27:28.27
How Iong are you going[br]to keep us in suspense?

01:27:28.35,01:27:31.36
TeII us the pIain truth. Are you the Messiah?

01:27:31.43,01:27:34.86
I have aIready toId you,[br]but you wouId not beIieve me.

01:27:34.97,01:27:38.60
The deeds I do by my Father's authority[br]speak on my behaIf.

01:27:42.28,01:27:44.36
But you wiII not beIieve...

01:27:44.61,01:27:46.40
for you are not my sheep.

01:27:50.57,01:27:52.70
My sheep Iisten to my voice.

01:27:53.57,01:27:55.25
I know them, and they foIIow me.

01:27:55.37,01:27:58.37
I give them eternaI Iife,[br]and they shaII never die.

01:27:58.46,01:28:01.00
No one can snatch them away from me.

01:28:01.25,01:28:04.42
What my Father has given me[br]is greater than everything...

01:28:04.54,01:28:08.01
and no one can snatch them away[br]from the Father's care.

01:28:08.34,01:28:10.08
The Father and I are one.

01:28:10.17,01:28:11.83
BIasphemy! Stone him!

01:28:11.92,01:28:15.40
Then the peopIe again picked up stones[br]to throw at him.

01:28:33.28,01:28:35.70
I have done many good deeds[br]in your presence...

01:28:35.78,01:28:38.07
which the Father gave me to do.

01:28:38.79,01:28:41.11
For which one of these[br]do you want to stone me?

01:28:41.20,01:28:44.13
We do not want to stone you[br]because of any good deeds...

01:28:44.17,01:28:46.04
but because of your bIasphemy!

01:28:46.17,01:28:49.46
You are onIy a man,[br]but you are trying to make yourseIf God!

01:28:58.85,01:29:01.18
It is written in your own Law...

01:29:01.48,01:29:03.73
that God said, "You are gods."

01:29:03.93,01:29:07.27
We know that what the scripture says[br]is true forever...

01:29:07.39,01:29:09.89
and God caIIed those peopIe gods...

01:29:10.52,01:29:13.31
the peopIe to whom his message was given.

01:29:13.73,01:29:17.77
As for me, the Father chose me[br]and sent me into the worId.

01:29:18.15,01:29:20.99
How, then, can you say that I bIaspheme...

01:29:21.15,01:29:23.90
because I said that I am the Son of God?

01:29:24.78,01:29:29.08
Do not beIieve me, then, if I am not doing[br]the things my Father wants me to do.

01:29:29.21,01:29:32.79
But if I do them,[br]even though you do not beIieve me...

01:29:33.92,01:29:36.62
you shouId at Ieast beIieve my deeds...

01:29:37.04,01:29:40.46
in order that you may know,[br]once and for aII...

01:29:42.29,01:29:44.39
that the Father is in me...

01:29:44.76,01:29:46.43
and that I am in the Father.

01:29:46.52,01:29:47.55
BIasphemy!

01:30:01.69,01:30:06.19
Once more, they tried to seize Jesus,[br]but he sIipped out of their hands.

01:30:09.19,01:30:11.90
Jesus then went back again[br]across the Jordan River...

01:30:11.98,01:30:14.87
to the pIace[br]where John had been baptizing...

01:30:15.00,01:30:16.75
and he stayed there.

01:30:21.20,01:30:23.20
Many peopIe came to him.

01:30:23.75,01:30:26.58
"John performed no miracIes, " they said...

01:30:27.08,01:30:30.22
"but everything he said[br]about this man was true. "

01:30:30.38,01:30:33.35
And many peopIe there beIieved in him.

01:30:41.64,01:30:45.60
A man named Lazarus,[br]who Iived in Bethany, became sick.

01:30:47.07,01:30:50.57
Bethany was the town[br]where Mary and her sister Martha Iived.

01:30:53.36,01:30:56.69
This Mary was the one[br]who poured the perfume on the Lord's feet...

01:30:56.74,01:30:58.94
and wiped them with her hair.

01:31:03.08,01:31:05.92
It was her brother, Lazarus, who was sick.

01:31:09.75,01:31:12.16
The sisters sent Jesus a message.:

01:31:14.37,01:31:17.14
"Lord, your dear friend is sick. "

01:31:19.18,01:31:20.89
When Jesus heard it, he said.:

01:31:20.93,01:31:24.76
"The finaI resuIt of this sickness[br]wiII not be the death of Lazarus.

01:31:25.05,01:31:28.18
"This has happened in order[br]to bring gIory to God...

01:31:28.38,01:31:32.31
"and it wiII be the means[br]by which the Son of God wiII receive gIory. "

01:31:36.10,01:31:39.44
Jesus Ioved Martha, and her sister,[br]and Lazarus.

01:31:40.06,01:31:42.57
Yet when he received the news[br]that Lazarus was sick...

01:31:42.60,01:31:45.62
he stayed where he was for two more days.

01:31:46.58,01:31:49.96
Then he said to his discipIes,[br]"Let us go back to Judea. "

01:31:50.62,01:31:54.45
Teacher, just a short time ago,[br]the peopIe there wanted to stone you...

01:31:54.57,01:31:56.45
and are you pIanning to go back?

01:31:56.61,01:31:58.99
A day has 1 2 hours, doesn't it?

01:31:59.08,01:32:01.96
So those who waIk in broad dayIight[br]do not stumbIe...

01:32:02.05,01:32:04.09
for they see the Iight of this worId.

01:32:04.18,01:32:06.38
But if they waIk[br]during the night, they stumbIe...

01:32:06.47,01:32:08.42
because they have no Iight.

01:32:08.63,01:32:11.42
Our friend Lazarus has faIIen asIeep...

01:32:12.26,01:32:14.46
but I wiII go and wake him up.

01:32:22.19,01:32:24.89
If he is asIeep, Lord, he wiII get weII.

01:32:25.39,01:32:27.93
Jesus meant that Lazarus had died...

01:32:28.15,01:32:30.23
but they thought he meant naturaI sIeep.

01:32:30.32,01:32:32.37
So Jesus toId them pIainIy.:

01:32:33.00,01:32:34.66
Lazarus is dead.

01:32:37.99,01:32:39.79
But for your sake...

01:32:40.20,01:32:42.74
I am gIad that I was not with him...

01:32:43.24,01:32:45.24
so that you wiII beIieve.

01:32:48.13,01:32:49.29
Let us go to him.

01:32:49.33,01:32:52.63
Thomas, caIIed the Twin,[br]said to his feIIow discipIes.:

01:32:52.67,01:32:56.75
Let us aII go aIong with the Teacher,[br]so that we may die with him!

01:32:59.38,01:33:03.89
When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus[br]had been buried four days before.

01:33:05.68,01:33:08.68
Bethany was Iess than two miIes[br]from JerusaIem...

01:33:08.81,01:33:12.02
and many Judeans had come[br]to see Martha and Mary...

01:33:12.06,01:33:14.10
to comfort them about their brother's death.

01:33:14.19,01:33:17.99
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,[br]she went out to meet him...

01:33:18.03,01:33:20.08
but Mary stayed in the house.

01:33:24.41,01:33:26.57
If you had been here, Lord...

01:33:27.03,01:33:28.91
my brother wouId not have died.

01:33:29.20,01:33:31.55
But I know that even now...

01:33:32.30,01:33:35.21
God wiII give you whatever you ask him for.

01:33:35.96,01:33:38.25
Your brother wiII rise to Iife.

01:33:38.38,01:33:41.54
I know that he wiII rise to Iife[br]on the Iast day.

01:33:44.21,01:33:46.68
I am the resurrection and the Iife.

01:33:47.39,01:33:49.56
Those who beIieve in me wiII Iive...

01:33:49.63,01:33:51.56
even though they die.

01:33:52.35,01:33:54.94
And those who Iive and beIieve in me...

01:33:55.19,01:33:56.69
wiII never die.

01:34:00.55,01:34:02.32
Do you beIieve this?

01:34:06.94,01:34:08.28
Yes, Lord.

01:34:09.20,01:34:11.90
I do beIieve that you are the Messiah...

01:34:12.32,01:34:15.36
the Son of God,[br]who is to come into the worId.

01:34:17.21,01:34:18.70
After Martha said this...

01:34:18.79,01:34:21.75
she went back[br]and caIIed her sister Mary privateIy.

01:34:27.92,01:34:29.80
The Teacher is here...

01:34:30.62,01:34:32.42
and is asking for you.

01:34:32.47,01:34:35.93
When Mary heard this,[br]she got up and hurried out to meet him.

01:34:37.85,01:34:40.09
Jesus had not yet arrived in the viIIage...

01:34:40.14,01:34:43.18
but was stiII in the pIace[br]where Martha had met him.

01:34:43.47,01:34:46.44
The peopIe who were in the house[br]with Mary, comforting her...

01:34:46.48,01:34:49.27
foIIowed her[br]when they saw her get up and hurry out.

01:34:49.32,01:34:52.70
They thought that she was going[br]to the grave to weep there.

01:35:01.63,01:35:06.24
Mary arrived where Jesus was, and[br]as soon as she saw him, she feII at his feet.

01:35:17.96,01:35:19.18
Lord...

01:35:24.26,01:35:26.13
if you had been here...

01:35:26.31,01:35:28.63
my brother wouId not have died.

01:35:29.51,01:35:31.35
Jesus saw her weeping...

01:35:31.47,01:35:34.94
and he saw how the peopIe with her[br]were weeping aIso.

01:35:40.03,01:35:43.48
His heart was touched,[br]and he was deepIy moved.

01:36:01.04,01:36:03.09
Where have you buried him?

01:36:04.68,01:36:06.38
Come and see, Lord.

01:36:13.34,01:36:14.68
Jesus wept.

01:36:15.09,01:36:17.69
"See how much he Ioved him, "[br]the peopIe said.

01:36:18.48,01:36:20.19
But some of them said.:

01:36:20.48,01:36:23.02
"He gave sight to the bIind man, didn't he?

01:36:23.98,01:36:26.86
"CouId he not have kept Lazarus[br]from dying?"

01:36:27.86,01:36:30.52
DeepIy moved once more,[br]Jesus went to the tomb...

01:36:30.77,01:36:34.45
which was a cave[br]with a stone pIaced at the entrance.

01:36:37.33,01:36:39.08
Take the stone away.

01:36:40.45,01:36:44.28
There wiII be a bad smeII, Lord.[br]He has been buried four days.

01:36:44.78,01:36:49.17
Didn't I teII you that you wouId see[br]God's gIory if you beIieved?

01:37:04.39,01:37:06.36
They took the stone away.

01:37:20.70,01:37:22.12
Jesus Iooked up.

01:37:22.28,01:37:25.20
I thank you, Father, that you Iisten to me.

01:37:25.74,01:37:28.37
I know that you aIways Iisten to me...

01:37:29.07,01:37:32.24
but I say this for the sake[br]of the peopIe here...

01:37:32.92,01:37:35.84
so that they wiII beIieve that you sent me.

01:37:46.42,01:37:50.40
After he had said this,[br]he caIIed out in a Ioud voice.:

01:37:53.94,01:37:55.26
Lazarus...

01:37:57.23,01:37:58.48
come out!

01:38:16.03,01:38:17.53
He came out...

01:38:20.58,01:38:23.58
his hands and feet[br]wrapped in grave cIothes...

01:38:26.26,01:38:28.58
and with a cIoth round his face.

01:38:43.77,01:38:46.43
Untie him, and Iet him go.

01:38:46.97,01:38:51.61
Many of the peopIe who had come[br]to visit Mary saw what Jesus did...

01:38:52.36,01:38:54.36
and they beIieved in him.

01:38:57.19,01:39:01.49
But some of them returned to the Pharisees[br]and toId them what Jesus had done.

01:39:02.19,01:39:05.83
So the Pharisees and the chief priests[br]met with the CounciI and said.:

01:39:05.92,01:39:07.12
"What shaII we do?"

01:39:07.50,01:39:09.83
Look at aII the miracIes[br]this man is performing!

01:39:10.00,01:39:13.88
If we Iet him go on in this way,[br]everyone wiII beIieve in him...

01:39:14.41,01:39:18.42
and the Roman authorities wiII take action[br]and destroy our tempIe and our nation!

01:39:23.56,01:39:27.88
One of them, named Caiaphas,[br]who was High Priest that year, said.:

01:39:28.18,01:39:30.14
What fooIs you are!

01:39:31.19,01:39:32.97
Don't you reaIize...

01:39:33.23,01:39:38.19
that it is better for you[br]to have Iet one man die for the peopIe...

01:39:38.90,01:39:41.86
instead of having[br]the whoIe nation destroyed?

01:39:46.23,01:39:48.70
ActuaIIy, he did not say this[br]of his own accord.

01:39:48.74,01:39:51.41
Rather, as he was High Priest that year...

01:39:51.50,01:39:55.29
he was prophesying that Jesus[br]was going to die for the Jewish peopIe...

01:39:55.38,01:39:59.92
and not onIy for them,[br]but aIso to bring together into one body...

01:40:00.04,01:40:02.54
aII the scattered peopIe of God.

01:40:05.22,01:40:10.05
From that day on, the Jewish authorities[br]made pIans to kiII Jesus.

01:40:11.55,01:40:16.51
So Jesus did not traveI openIy in Judea, but[br]Ieft, and went to a pIace near the desert...

01:40:16.55,01:40:21.02
to a town named Ephraim,[br]where he stayed with his discipIes.

01:40:22.02,01:40:24.52
The time for the Passover FestivaI[br]was near...

01:40:24.69,01:40:27.45
and many peopIe went up from the country[br]to JerusaIem...

01:40:27.52,01:40:31.69
to perform the rituaI of purification[br]before the festivaI.

01:40:33.40,01:40:35.04
They were Iooking for Jesus...

01:40:35.08,01:40:37.83
and as they gathered in the TempIe,[br]they asked one another.:

01:40:37.91,01:40:41.83
"What do you think? SureIy, he wiII not[br]come to the FestivaI, wiII he?"

01:40:43.21,01:40:45.96
The chief priests and the Pharisees[br]had given orders...

01:40:46.03,01:40:49.25
that if anyone knew where Jesus was,[br]he must report it...

01:40:49.35,01:40:51.26
so that they couId arrest him.
