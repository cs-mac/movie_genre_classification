1
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,284
Did you feel that?

2
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,856
Kiss-kiss!

3
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,868
It's OK, it's OK. It was great.

4
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,032
Is there anything you're keeping from me?

5
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,105
No...

6
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,913
What day is today?

7
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,416
How did you know?

8
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,214
God told me.

9
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,617
You have party tonight?

10
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,553
Yes, I'm going out
with some friends later.

11
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,892
What are you thinking now?

12
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,866
I wish you were here.

13
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,835
I want to show you something...

14
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,907
Close your eyes first.

15
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,680
You can look now!

16
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,085
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!

17
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,161
That is Taipei.

18
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,460
I really hope that you will be here.

19
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,899
Do you mean that?

20
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,030
Do I look like a liar?

21
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,742
I might show up one day.

22
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,207
Welcome.

23
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,178
Tell me when you're ready.

24
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,189
Yes. I will.

25
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,358
Kiss, kiss!

26
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,120
Bye.

27
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,059
Bye.

28
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,994
Happy birthday...

29
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,323
Happy birthday...

30
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,712
- Hi!
- Hi. No Viktor?

31
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,979
He'll be here soon.

32
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,883
Happy belated birthday.

33
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,424
Thank you.

34
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,293
Take your coat off.

35
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,940
Can I have some water?

36
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,743
Thanks.

37
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,087
How's he doing in school.

38
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:59,419
Fine. You can ask him when he comes.

39
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,624
How long have you lived here for?

40
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,731
Why?

41
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,232
I was just wondering
if you're happy here.

42
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,629
Well, yes...

43
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,639
It could be nice here... if you
just sorted yourself out a bit more.

44
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,401
Listen, Mum.

45
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,979
If you're going to start
we might as well forget it.

46
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,992
Hello!

47
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,362
Hi! Come in!

48
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:59,314
- Is it cold out?
- A bit.

49
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,683
My, how you've grown!

50
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,385
Happy birthday!

51
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,692
- Thanks.
- Did you find your way OK?

52
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:18,566
Yeah...
We've bought you a little cake.

53
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,706
How lovely...!

54
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,036
We didn't want to
have to carry it on the train.

55
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,289
Kicki, come and sit yourself down.

56
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,118
Viktor can take care of that.

57
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,226
Can you make the coffee?

58
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,654
What is it?

59
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:53,601
Can't you find something for you
to do together?

60
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,967
He'd be so happy.

61
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,770
But Mum, I can't come up with
something just like that.

62
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,909
That's usually
not a problem for you.

63
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,744
Thanks.

64
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,909
Look, I'll pay.

65
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,022
Happy birthday to you

66
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:24,833
Happy birthday to you...

67
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,064
Thanks. Thanks very much.

68
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:35,170
Four cheers for Kicki!

69
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,078
Thanks. Thanks.

70
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,795
For you.

71
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,426
Oh, thanks!

72
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,564
You shouldn't have...

73
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,674
It's from Grandma too.

74
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,809
So sweet.

75
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:19,357
It must be ages since you
heard Happy Birthday in Swedish!

76
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,690
Yes, ages!

77
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,425
Oh, look!

78
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,460
It's lovely!

79
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,338
Thanks.

80
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,887
Pardon?

81
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,362
Nice cake.

82
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,507
Viktor...

83
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,809
...would... would you like
to come on holiday with me for a week?

84
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,319
I mean... only if you want to, that is.

85
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,384
We haven't really spent time together
since I came home.

86
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,254
Sure.

87
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,884
Take a week off school.

88
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,587
I can go whenever.

89
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,332
It'll be fun!

90
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:27,410
- Here it is.
- Are you sure?

91
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,351
Yes. Number 16.

92
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,155
Hello.

93
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,763
You want room?

94
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:39,887
How much is it?

95
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,124
Restorsleep?

96
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:41,699
Sorry?

97
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,426
Restorsleep?

98
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,501
"Restorsleep"?

99
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:51,099
- He's asking if it's for rest or sleep.
- Sleep. Two days. How much is it?

100
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,039
Very cheap.

101
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,578
Cash is OK. Cash OK.

102
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,306
It's OK with credit card also?

103
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,850
Cash better. Credit card OK.

104
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,452
The big window for the lady.

105
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,145
Thank you.

106
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,917
How do you say thank you in Chinese?

107
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,853
Well, here it is.

108
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,565
Exciting, eh?

109
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,235
Have you got the right room?

110
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,966
I'll see you in a bit, then.

111
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,404
OK.

112
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,085
Viktor?

113
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,748
Yes?

114
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,221
Can you hear me?

115
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,791
Yes...

116
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,777
Damn.

117
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,406
What?

118
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,518
Nothing.

119
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,587
Do you fancy going to do something?

120
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:51,492
Or do you want to go to bed?

121
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,121
I don't know. Want to see my room?

122
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,035
Look.

123
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,506
Cool.

124
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,485
It's not that bad here, after all.

125
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,886
It's OK.

126
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,826
Maybe we should be getting to bed.

127
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,628
Sure.

128
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,601
Good night.

129
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:34,637
You too.

130
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,638
And don't forget I can hear everything!

131
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,273
I'll close the door.

132
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,218
Good night!

133
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,117
Good night!

134
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,484
Sorry. Can I buy something to drink?

135
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,089
Of course.

136
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,659
Beer?

137
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,526
Perfect. Thank you.

138
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,194
I join you.

139
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,911
Is it always so noisy?

140
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,443
Daytime, bang, bang, bang...

141
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,382
Night-time,

142
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,081
king, king, kong, kong...

143
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,781
Better.

144
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,936
How I say your name?

145
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,904
My name? K-Kicki.

146
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,439
Kikiki?

147
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,236
No, Kicki.

148
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:18,968
Kicki.

149
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,601
Kicki, yes.

150
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,737
You sitting OK?

151
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,712
No problem.

152
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,049
Do you know this address?

153
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,353
Neihu. The Neihu district.

154
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,893
Neihu? Is it far away?

155
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,758
No.

156
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:43,231
No? OK, thank you.

157
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,564
What is this?

158
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,931
It's a secret.

159
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,740
On my roof,

160
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,276
Taipei is more beautiful than anything.

161
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,504
Here's your coffee.

162
00:16:56,648 --> 00:17:00,277
Thank you.

163
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,382
Excuse me, can we sit here?

164
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,788
Thank you.

165
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,326
Will they come out with the food?

166
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,025
What do you usually eat for breakfast?

167
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,028
Different things. Bread and cheese.

168
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:24,006
Grandma makes you breakfast in bed, right?

169
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,909
I usually make breakfast
for her, actually.

170
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:37,547
I called Grandma yesterday
and said we'd arrived safely.

171
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:43,753
Oh, really? So how was she, then?

172
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,055
She was alright.

173
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,689
Thanks.

174
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,665
Thank you.

175
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,467
Are you going out with anyone?

176
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,377
Have you got a girlfriend?

177
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,777
How do you say it?

178
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,884
How do we say it?

179
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,146
I don't know, I don't do it...

180
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,785
Have you got anyone?

181
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,019
God, no. It's just me.

182
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,721
May I?

183
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:18,989
Sure.

184
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,363
You don't smoke, do you?

185
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,797
No.

186
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,595
We made a bet once.

187
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,374
So I've had one cigarette.

188
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,970
That's so daft!

189
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,184
I was going to ask about school.

190
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,313
It's what all adults ask when they
don't know what to talk about!

191
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:55,495
Can we go and see that building later,
I've got a few things to do. Buy stuff.

192
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,566
OK.

193
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,761
So I'll see you at the hotel at?

194
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,030
Sure...

195
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,599
Thank you.

196
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,901
May I help you?

197
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,478
Yes, please. May I use your bathroom?

198
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,672
Yes. This way, please.

199
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,680
Thank you.

200
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,636
Excuse me...

201
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,671
Excuse me, do you know the way to the...

202
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,686
Hello...

203
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,586
Hello!

204
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,033
Where are you going?

205
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,602
I'm just going.

206
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,000
Where?

207
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,766
Into town.

208
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,975
I can help you.

209
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,942
No, thanks.

210
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,411
That way, nothing.

211
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,723
So is it far?

212
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,350
No, here.

213
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,060
What's your name? I'm Didi.

214
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,736
Viktor.

215
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,372
Viktor, OK...

216
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,136
Where are you from?

217
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,006
I'm from Sweden.

218
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,688
Come!

219
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,529
You take.

220
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,193
- It's not...
- If you show me I can walk.

221
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,824
No, I drive you.

222
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,231
It's OK.

223
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,305
No, it's OK.

224
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,800
Hi! Hello. Sorry I'm late.

225
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:30,833
That's OK.

226
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,732
I got a bit lost.

227
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,115
Is that... a new... little...

228
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,751
Pretty sexy, eh?

229
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,116
Do you like it?

230
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,951
Yes, it's nice.

231
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,893
Why, hello!

232
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:58,688
Hello!

233
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,730
How are you? What you do today?

234
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,424
I'm fine, how are you?

235
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,467
I been busy...

236
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,538
Oh, that's beautiful.

237
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,333
Like you.

238
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,534
What you do today?

239
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,774
Stop asking.

240
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:22,285
- They haven't spent the day together.
- I'm just asking.

241
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,914
- Well don't.
- She's been drinking, OK?

242
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:45,137
Ladies and Gentlemen we have arrived
at the 89th floor, thank you.

243
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,425
Shall I take your picture?

244
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,761
Please do!

245
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,536
Stand looking out of the window.

246
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,122
It worked out well with us doing
our own thing today, didn't it?

247
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,792
You didn't have to drag
your old mum around with you.

248
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,424
We can do it again tomorrow,
and then have dinner together.

249
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,566
Well?

250
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,731
OK...

251
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,313
So are you doing
anything special tomorrow?

252
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,582
No...

253
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,855
...not really.

254
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,619
You?

255
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,887
There's loads to do.

256
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,124
I'll see.

257
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,439
I'll just go
and have a look over there.

258
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,188
Viktor!

259
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,629
Hello.

260
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,102
Hello.

261
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,369
So, what you do today?

262
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:35,335
I don't know.
Just going into town.

263
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,179
So I can drive you.

264
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,381
Do you have a new motorcycle today?

265
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,421
Yes, every day.

266
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,821
But I will give back, always.

267
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,992
I'm looking for Mr. Chang.

268
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,535
No people.

269
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,164
No people?

270
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,069
No people!

271
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,546
You want drive?

272
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,607
OK, sure.

273
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,019
So...

274
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:46,000
Hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

275
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,270
What do you mean, hurry?

276
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,737
Go fast!

277
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,293
OK are you all right?

278
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,759
What are you?

279
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,493
Any question?

280
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,615
You want noodles?

281
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,454
OK, thanks.

282
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,129
Come here.

283
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,860
OK!

284
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,391
It's very hot.

285
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,968
Yeah.

286
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:00,895
Thanks.

287
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,472
It's good.

288
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,414
It's OK.

289
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,786
Yeah.

290
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,393
It's good.

291
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,794
OK.

292
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,054
Good? Good?

293
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,820
Yeah!

294
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,228
Really good.

295
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,357
You are like me.

296
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,969
Well how do you mean?

297
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:15,234
You are sad, but happy, outside.

298
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,370
OK!

299
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,847
So where's your father?

300
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,043
I don't have a father.

301
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,744
You don't have?

302
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,219
No, I never had one.

303
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,051
Actually, I don't think

304
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,658
my mum knows who he is.

305
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,889
She had a lot of boyfriends.

306
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,726
How many?

307
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,132
I don't know.

308
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,462
I don't live with her,

309
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,434
I live with my grandmother.

310
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,203
But she live with you now?

311
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,332
Yeah, here in Taipei.

312
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,808
She wants to get to know me.

313
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,878
And you?

314
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,673
My mum is dead.

315
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,045
- Dead?
-Yes.

316
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,415
And my father,

317
00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:03,460
he just play cards
and drink beers...

318
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:04,993
He gamble.

319
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,063
He's a gambler.

320
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,927
So he loses money?

321
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,193
Of course he lose money!

322
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,998
He's a fucking loser! Really.

323
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,198
Sju Sjosjuka Sjostjarnor!

324
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:25,771
Sju Sjosjuka Sjonairna...!

325
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,680
It's too difficult.

326
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:33,417
It's too difficult.

327
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:37,050
You know
you are a very nice person.

328
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,061
You're a very nice man.

329
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,597
Yeah, I like you.

330
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,664
My son is also very nice.

331
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,372
You're nice.

332
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,448
Me?

333
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,175
No.

334
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,115
No!

335
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,811
What?

336
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,547
I don't know.

337
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,127
Shit!

338
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:28,736
Shit! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

339
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,843
You come Taiwan for man?

340
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:40,690
Yes. Jesus Christ.

341
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,886
And you know what?
I didn't speak to him.

342
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,928
No.

343
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,430
I was supposed to be a surprise.

344
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,094
And then I... Whatever.

345
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,308
I'm so stupid.

346
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,170
No.

347
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,642
No? Yes.

348
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,906
I am stupid.

349
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,749
I'm a coconut.

350
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,654
What?

351
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,555
Bang on the floor!

352
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,367
Like fountain!

353
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,703
I don't understand.

354
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,573
I happy, you happy.

355
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,508
Yeah?

356
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,907
So put on the music again.

357
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,037
Put on the good music.

358
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,705
So we can dance.

359
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,214
Yeah?

360
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,318
No. No, don't take that.

361
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,651
Don't take it.

362
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,388
He's a foreigner
and you're Taiwanese.

363
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,501
If you didn't take him there,
who did?

364
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:58,465
He want to drink.

365
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,035
Don't you know how dangerous
that place is?

366
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,332
How old are you?

367
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,736
I've told his mum to come.

368
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,367
Translate.

369
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,438
He says your mother is coming.

370
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,281
But I can go by myself.

371
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,614
What did he say?

372
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:18,949
He said he's fine.

373
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,489
Fine?

374
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:28,123
I'm warning you, do you understand?

375
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:36,003
Hello. Hello, I am Kicki.

376
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,198
I am his mother.

377
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,138
How are you!

378
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,072
Hello.

379
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,542
Hi.

380
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,675
I'm just saying
it's a dangerous place to drink.

381
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,080
It's a restricted area.

382
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,517
Other than that, there's no problem.

383
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,083
Tell her to take a seat.

384
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,190
He want you to sit.

385
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:02,364
Sit?

386
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,304
Ask them if they like Taiwan.

387
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,548
He says you can go later.

388
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,082
OK.

389
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,690
Tell him that
I'm very sorry about this.

390
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,658
I will take care of my son better.

391
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,989
What did she say?

392
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,892
That she loves Taiwan.

393
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,700
Do you think he works here?

394
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,733
No.

395
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,702
But who is he?

396
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,640
Tea

397
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,676
You have very beautiful eyes.

398
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,513
Yes, you have!

399
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:03,587
So why you come here, Taiwan?

400
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,318
To Taiwan?

401
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,054
Yes.

402
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,860
Well, because I thought it was
good for us to travel together.

403
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,596
To make a trip together...

404
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,935
We haven't been travelling
for a long time.

405
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,304
But do you know what?

406
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,474
He's always been
so afraid of flying.

407
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,483
What?

408
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,217
I have an address to a friend,

409
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,451
but it's written in Chinese.

410
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,825
So I don't know what it says.

411
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:44,401
Do you know... where this is?

412
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,026
Which area?

413
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,035
Are you coming?

414
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,696
Yes.

415
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,499
Here.

416
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,667
OK!

417
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,836
Is it far away?

418
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,242
No.

419
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,987
Excuse me, Mr. Driver,

420
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,859
where are we going?

421
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,357
We go to your friend.

422
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,866
Now?

423
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,203
Where are we going now?

424
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,808
Well, let's go to my friend.

425
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,273
Who is she?

426
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,844
Your friend misunderstood.

427
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:44,218
I just asked where on the island the
address was and now we're on our way.

428
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:37,771
How are you?

429
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,542
Looking for anyone?

430
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:43,979
Hello?

431
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,418
Hello.

432
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,589
Good evening.

433
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,454
Good evening.

434
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,259
May I help you?

435
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,496
Yes...

436
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,732
I'm looking for Mr. Chang.

437
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:04,238
Oh, OK. Follow me, please.

438
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,536
I'll be right back.

439
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,080
So he's home?

440
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,548
Yes.

441
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,349
Shall I take them off?

442
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,977
Yes.

443
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,125
Shall I put these on?

444
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,726
Thank you.

445
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,001
You're welcome.

446
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,589
Hi!

447
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,589
Hi!

448
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,360
Hi, I'm Gwen.

449
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:05,729
Hello, I'm Kicki.

450
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:10,203
Kicki. Are you here for Mr. Cheng?

451
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:10,806
Yes.

452
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:15,310
I drove by
and I just want to say hi.

453
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:16,913
A little surprise.

454
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,312
OK. No problem. He's inside.

455
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,782
Please follow me. Watch out.

456
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,318
OK!

457
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,917
I guess you live
in this neighborhood?

458
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:26,784
No!

459
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,290
Do you work with him
at his office?

460
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,724
No, I'm on vacation

461
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,352
and I just want to say hi.

462
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,294
OK good

463
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,992
Let me introduce you to our kids.

464
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,568
Come on.

465
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:43,099
Say your names.

466
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,901
In English, of course.

467
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:45,940
Hi, I'm Nicholas.

468
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,703
Nice to meet you.

469
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,480
Hi. I'm Kicki.

470
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,744
Hi, I'm Ellen.

471
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,181
Kicki.

472
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,150
Why don't you join us for dinner?

473
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,652
No, I must go.

474
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,586
People are waiting for me.

475
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,851
But I think they're coming in.

476
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,087
Hi, my name's Gwen.

477
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,527
Hello I'm Viktor.

478
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,529
Viktor nice to meet you.

479
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,792
You too.

480
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,424
And this is my friend, Didi.

481
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:13,797
Hi

482
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,935
He's my son.

483
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:18,507
Oh, good. Please join us.

484
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,007
Please sit down here.

485
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,804
Have something to eat.

486
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,178
Why are you standing there?
Come and say hi.

487
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,653
Hi, Kicki. What a surprise.

488
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,315
Hi.

489
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,861
I just want to say hi.

490
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,724
Maybe it's a bad time?

491
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,262
No, not at all.

492
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,299
So, are you on a business trip
in Taiwan?

493
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,833
Yes...

494
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,737
You are?

495
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,569
Viktor, her son.

496
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,173
So you're her friend?

497
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,609
They are business partners.

498
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:00,342
Business.

499
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,580
Please sit down.

500
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,593
Is it your first time
to visit Taiwan?

501
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,471
Yes.

502
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,631
How do you like it here?

503
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,333
I think it's beautiful.

504
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,747
So you are their Taiwanese friend?

505
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:32,541
Yes.

506
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,708
You met here in Taiwan?

507
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,453
Good.

508
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,556
Then you can show them around.

509
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,660
Have you been Sun Moon Lake?

510
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:49,164
Sun Moon Lake? No.

511
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,231
No?

512
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,461
No. We've just been to Taipei.

513
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,031
I think we should call Mr. Hong

514
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,733
and make a reservation.

515
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,003
It would be a shame

516
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,669
if they only saw Taipei.

517
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,611
It's not necessary.

518
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,013
It is our pleasure.

519
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,884
It is.

520
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,746
Viktor right?

521
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,358
Are you still in school?

522
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,793
Yes.

523
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,190
So what do you study?

524
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,957
Just normal school.

525
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,123
I see.

526
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,236
My daughter studies music.

527
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,394
Play something for us.

528
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,367
Now?

529
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,699
Yes.

530
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,670
What shall I play?

531
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,741
It doesn't matter.

532
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,865
But we haven't eaten yet.

533
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,535
Just play now.

534
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,910
She will play some music for us.

535
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,250
Well, I guess we should go.

536
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:35,059
Shit! Money!

537
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,534
I guess we all have a reservation
at Sun Moon Lake.

538
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,578
Please stop at the corner.

539
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,213
Bye bye.

540
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,415
Bye bye.

541
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,116
Bye.

542
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,844
Was that why we came here?

543
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,639
I don't want to talk about it.

544
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,061
Viktor, wait. Viktor!

545
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,073
I don't want your fucking money.

546
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,165
Pack your things. We're leaving.

547
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,073
Leaving?

548
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,370
Didi, you're welcome too.

549
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:44,207
We're going to that Sun Moon Lake.

550
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,939
Are you serious?

551
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,607
Does it look like I'm joking?

552
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:51,152
Please help him.

553
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:01,663
Are you sure she really
want me to go?

554
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,500
Yeah, I think so.

555
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,204
Is OK I come?

556
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,081
I don't want to be alone with her.

557
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,023
Are you hungry or anything?

558
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,499
No.

559
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,837
Didi? Didi!

560
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,749
Do you want some snacks?

561
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,288
Something to eat?

562
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,415
Viktor, do you want...

563
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,655
Here, you take it.

564
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,904
So, Mr. Viktor. Your key.

565
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,212
Shall we have dinner later?

566
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,114
We'll have a look around on our own.

567
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,584
OK

568
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,382
See you later then.

569
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,089
Comfortable trip?

570
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,529
It was fine. Long, but fine...

571
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,403
We should just float away.

572
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,374
Where?

573
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,172
You know, out...

574
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,744
You know this is a lake.

575
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,649
Yes, so?

576
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,416
We could find an island
and never come back.

577
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,048
Start our own country.

578
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,919
You can be the president.

579
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:27,833
And you?

580
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,869
I don't want to be anything.

581
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,942
Do you have a girlfriend?

582
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,750
No.

583
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,221
Do you?

584
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,662
I don't know. She's nice.

585
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,691
What?

586
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:48,270
What?

587
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:54,444
Why should I come home?

588
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,920
I don't have the money.

589
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:11,859
They're not going to harm you.

590
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,992
So do you have
any brothers or sisters?

591
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:16,332
No, but I wish.

592
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,931
What are your parents doing?

593
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,271
My mother is dead, and my father...

594
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,903
His father gambles away their money.

595
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,450
When Viktor was four,

596
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,556
why you move to America?

597
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,290
Because I was working
so much there...

598
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,462
So we thought it was better
for Viktor to stay

599
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,329
with his grandmother.

600
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,206
But you live in Sweden now?

601
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,938
Yes, I moved back a year ago.

602
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,015
Why are you talking to her?

603
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,980
Do you think it's funny?

604
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,943
No.

605
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,350
Why are you laughing?

606
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,162
Why are you laughing?

607
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:45,457
I have to go back to Taipei.

608
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,530
No. Why?

609
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,764
Do you mean you have to go now?

610
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,425
Yes.

611
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,209
Hi! Where have you been?

612
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,339
I've been looking for you.

613
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,645
Where's Didi?

614
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:46,253
Hasn't he spoken to you?

615
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,655
Where is he?

616
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,020
Viktor, come and sit down.

617
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,925
Let's have something to eat.

618
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,429
Hey...

619
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,559
Viktor...

620
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,833
Can't we talk about it?

621
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,177
You planned all this.

622
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:13,476
Why are you so angry all the time?

623
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:17,143
Angry? Don't you know
why I'm angry with you?

624
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,345
Where do you want me to start?

625
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,419
I just don't get you.

626
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,753
That's enough.

627
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,828
Why did you bring me along?

628
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,796
If I'm such a pain, why invite me?

629
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:34,096
Because I thought
we'd have a good time together.

630
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,329
Grandma made you, I know she did.

631
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,440
No she didn't!

632
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,341
You're just jealous.

633
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:44,970
Jealous?

634
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:48,572
Because I went to meet Mr. Chang.

635
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,744
Do you know what they call people
who fuck for money?

636
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,388
Well?

637
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:58,449
You're just a piss head cunt.

638
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,731
What the hell...?

639
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,369
Oh, Jesus...

640
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,340
Viktor?

641
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,976
Hey, Viktor...

642
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,412
I was thinking about
what happened last night.

643
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,515
Hey, open up...

644
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,717
Hello.

645
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:13,554
Hello?

646
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,391
Hello.

647
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:21,194
I'm looking for my son.

648
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:23,232
Check out.

649
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:25,733
Check out.

650
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,433
Check out?

651
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,039
Check out?

652
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,115
Check out.

653
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:05,369
Hello... Is Viktor here?

654
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:08,005
Viktor? No.

655
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,481
I need to speak to...

656
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,518
A Huang?

657
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,720
Miss Kicki! Is something wrong?

658
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,653
Yes.

659
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,588
I need you to call the police.

660
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:18,818
Police? Why?

661
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,020
The policeman who called here
the other night.

662
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,926
Because Viktor is gone.

663
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:25,997
Is gone?

664
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:29,036
I think the policeman
might know where he is.

665
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:30,604
OK OK

666
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,307
Hello?

667
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:42,543
I'm looking for the policeman
who called here the other night.

668
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:46,749
Her son seems to be missing.

669
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,690
Five minutes, OK?

670
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,991
Five minutes? OK.

671
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,669
Thank you. Thank you.

672
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,373
It's OK.

673
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:11,412
OK?

674
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,037
Here it is.

675
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,615
OK think you.

676
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,685
OK. Bye bye. Thank you.

677
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,285
Bye bye.

678
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:02,429
Hello?

679
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,099
Hello, Didi?

680
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:12,005
Hi.

681
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,268
Do you know where Viktor is?

682
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,377
Is he here?

683
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,706
I don't know. Please go away.

684
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,405
I need to speak to you.

685
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,641
Please go away.

686
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,883
What's going on?

687
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,821
Do you know where he is?

688
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,531
What the...?

689
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,345
Viktor, what's going on?

690
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,416
Don't worry.

691
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,383
My father went to get more money.

692
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,513
What's going on, Didi?

693
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,624
He should've come two hours ago.

694
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,653
They want more.

695
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,422
OK...

696
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,327
I'll try to help you.

697
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,927
Tell him I'll try to help.

698
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:15,866
She can get the money.

699
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:17,267
Is she going to call the police?

700
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,874
I'm warning you.

701
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:25,040
If you call the police...

702
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,550
Don't call the police.

703
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,015
No. No.

704
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,114
Did you find your son?

705
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,626
Can you drive me to Neihu?

706
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,526
Are you OK?

707
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,826
Yes.

708
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,437
I think we have a problem.

709
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,735
I'm going to need backup.

710
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,742
Close to Chung Hua and Shin Jiang.

711
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,193
Hello, may I help you?

712
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,321
I just want to speak to Mr. Chang.

713
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,592
Mr. Chang is in a meeting.

714
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,931
I just need him for two seconds.

715
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,301
I can't let you but if important...

716
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,873
It's very important.

717
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,475
You can talk to him later.

718
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:28,768
Let go of me!

719
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,250
I just want to speak to him
for two minutes.

720
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,320
Can I speak to you for two minutes?

721
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,054
It's very important.

722
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,395
Give me two minutes.
Please, please...

723
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,399
What the...?

724
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,570
I don't know what to do.

725
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,454
I don't think my father's coming back.

726
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,896
I am so sorry about all this.

727
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,196
But I really need your help.

728
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,335
I want her gone. Call the police.

729
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:32,599
You don't know

730
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,608
My son's in trouble. I need money.

731
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,739
You come to me
because I have money?

732
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,283
You never told me you had a family.

733
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,153
Leave us.

734
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:50,617
Please...

735
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,693
You never told me you had a son.

736
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:54,693
Please, I need to know

737
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,297
if you can help me or not.

738
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,606
Give each other a kiss.

739
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,611
What's he saying?

740
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:15,815
He say to kiss.

741
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,310
Go on, then.

742
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,986
Go on.

743
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:37,830
Nice one. Now a French kiss.

744
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,714
Stop that!

745
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,478
It's disgusting!

746
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,800
Can't you stop pacing?

747
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,202
How long are we going to wait?

748
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:54,105
Don’t move

749
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,416
Go!

750
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,214
Hello!

751
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,790
Hi. Is everything OK?

752
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,054
Yes.

753
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:42,322
Thank you very much for helping me.

754
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:45,964
OK. You want room, Miss Kicki?

755
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,159
Same room, please.

756
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:47,734
OK.

757
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,860
Same room.

758
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,873
So, what you do tonight?

759
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:54,738
I don't know.

760
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:57,310
Maybe we should go out
eating or something.

761
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,209
Are you hungry?

762
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,747
I know something special.

763
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:05,284
Yes?

764
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,751
Special.

765
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,185
Want to borrow some clothes?

766
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:16,524
I'm OK.

767
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:35,444
You are not angry with me?

768
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,355
Are you angry?

769
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,919
No.

770
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,422
You should take these.

771
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,157
He'll be right out.

772
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,252
Good.

773
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:22,621
Come on.

774
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,940
I don't know where to start...

775
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,445
There's so much... I want to say...

776
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:42,345
It's OK.

777
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,213
Grandma didn't make me.

778
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:49,722
I really wanted you to come with me.

779
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:53,423
I didn't mean it.

780
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,260
I just wanted you to know that.

781
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,629
I don't know if you're aware

782
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:08,767
that Grandma... that Grandma's...

783
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,736
That she's sick?
In some strange way,

784
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,264
I'm still glad we came here!

785
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,638
Me too.

786
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,677
It's nice, isn't it.

787
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,856
Lovely.
