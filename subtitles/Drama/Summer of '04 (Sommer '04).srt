1
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:54,283
Hey! Look at this! There's a dinosaur!

2
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:55,443
Huh?

3
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,478
Urgh. He always runs off suddenly.

4
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,665
Here! You must be thirsty!

5
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:11,367
Thanks...

6
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:15,037
Oh, no! It's three minutes 'til!

7
00:01:15,037 --> 00:01:16,664
H-Hold on, Shinichi!

8
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,549
Alright! We made it in time!

9
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,586
What is this place?
It's just an ordinary plaza...

10
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,254
Just watch!

11
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:35,824
Ten. Nine. Eight.

12
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:39,261
Seven. Six. Five.

13
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:42,998
Four! Three! Two!

14
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:43,987
One!

15
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,224
What?!

16
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,277
These fountains go off every two hours.

17
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:58,046
You like stuff like this, right?

18
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:00,015
Shinichi!

19
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:04,787
It's your present for winning
the city karate championship!

20
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,288
Accept it gratefully!

21
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:08,586
Oh, you think you're such a big shot!

22
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:17,566
A rainbow!

23
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,202
Alright! Let's make a toast!

24
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:21,191
Okay!

25
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,267
Gah...

26
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,208
You're so funny!

27
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:05,247
I'm high school detective Kudo Shinichi!

28
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:09,418
I went with old friend and classmate,
Mori Ran, to an amusement park

29
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:13,689
where I witnessed a suspicious
deal with a man dressed in black!

30
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,191
I was so absorbed with watching the deal

31
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:19,319
that I didn't notice a second
man sneak up from behind me!

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,436
He forced me to take a poison,
and when I woke up...

33
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:30,038
...my body had shrunk!

34
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:33,876
If they learned Kudo Shinichi was alive,
they might go after me again,

35
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,378
putting all the people around me in danger!

36
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:39,948
Per Dr. Agasa's advice,
I decided to conceal my identity.

37
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:44,386
When Ran asked my name,
I quickly answered, "Edogawa Conan."

38
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,221
To get information on the men,

39
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:49,315
I wound up living with Ran
and her detective father.

40
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,631
Great Detective Mori! What was
the key to solving this latest case?!

41
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,192
No, uhh, I don't really remember...

42
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,406
That's only natural.

43
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:07,476
'Cause I always put the old guy to
sleep with my stun-gun wristwatch

44
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:13,649
and use my voice-changing bowtie
to solve cases with his voice.

45
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:17,185
Dr. Agasa invented these two gadgets!

46
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,487
Hi there!

47
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:23,325
He's always making unique gadgets,
like a Turbo-Engine Skateboard,

48
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:30,322
Tracking Glasses, and
Power-Assisted Kick Shoes!

49
00:04:32,768 --> 00:04:38,240
However, neither Ran nor her dad
have realized who I really am.

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,542
The only ones who know are Dr. Agasa,

51
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,445
Hattori Heiji, the high
school detective of the west,

52
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:47,349
and my classmate, Haibara Ai.

53
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,952
She originally worked with the men in black,

54
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:56,380
but to escape from them, she took
the same poison I did and shrank!

55
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:01,296
The Black Organization
still remains a mystery!

56
00:05:01,296 --> 00:05:07,428
And now, a large barrier is about
to stand between Ran and me!

57
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:17,279
Even when I'm small, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

58
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,543
There is always only one truth!

59
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,598
Fountains?

60
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:40,302
Yeah! It was so pretty with
the rainbow and everything!

61
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:42,304
Oh, yeah! It was!

62
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:45,941
Ugh. She remembers the stupidest things...

63
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:48,810
Say! Let's go to Tropical Land again!

64
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,611
Eh?!

65
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:54,416
We've never gone there
together since that day!

66
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:59,154
Of course we haven't!
I've been little ever since that day!

67
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:01,256
So, when do you wanna go?

68
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:02,924
No, uhh...

69
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,661
- Do you think Conan-kun's home?
- Good question!

70
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,031
We'll just have to find out!

71
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:15,671
Sorry, Ran! I'm involved in another case!
I'll call you again! Later!

72
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,873
Oh! Wait! Shinichi!

73
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:21,502
Urgh! It's always "case, case, case"!

74
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,842
You stupid case freak!

75
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:30,285
Not even Conan-kun'll figure this one out!

76
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:33,846
I can't wait to see his "I give up" look!

77
00:06:34,856 --> 00:06:37,292
Conan-kun's "I give up," huh?

78
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,624
I give up! You beat me!

79
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,492
"Victory"

80
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:44,066
What're you smilin' about?

81
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:45,133
Conan-kun!

82
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:49,471
Perfect timing! We were just
headed to your place right now!

83
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:53,575
All three of us thought
up a super special riddle!

84
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,377
Riddle?

85
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:56,411
Ready?

86
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:00,082
When asked what she
thinks Conan-kun is like,

87
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:03,318
Haibara-san looked at the moon
and answered, "He's not summer."

88
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:09,524
Did Haibara-san 1. praise Conan-kun,
or 2. insult Conan-kun?

89
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,426
Which is it?!

90
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:16,031
Not summer... Moon...

91
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,500
Got it! The answer is #2!

92
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,036
- Eh?!
- W-Why is that?!

93
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:24,406
The months, or "moons," of summer
are June, July, and August.

94
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:28,076
Together, their numbers spell out,
"There's nothing good about him!"

95
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:30,879
You really are amazing, Conan-kun!

96
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,448
Bah! You're no fun.

97
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:36,418
Never mind that. Tell me
why you were smiling earlier.

98
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,553
Okay, then will you "I give up" for us?

99
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:39,713
Huh?

100
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,360
- Let's cross!
- Hold it! No crossing!

101
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,530
A blinking green light is
the same as a yellow light.

102
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,299
Wait until the next green light.

103
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:54,436
Okay...

104
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:55,771
We got in trouble...

105
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:59,605
Yeah, but he is right.

106
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,715
Now, I have a question for you!

107
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:09,551
What do you think that man's job is?

108
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,745
Eh?

109
00:08:12,387 --> 00:08:14,923
A school teacher?

110
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:18,059
A businessman?
No, he doesn't have a briefcase...

111
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,828
An eel restaurant owner?

112
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,163
The answer is "police detective."

113
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,398
P-Police detective?!

114
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:25,567
Whenever police detectives
need to make note of something,

115
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,230
they rotate their police
notebooks and write horizontally.

116
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:33,175
- Really?
- You're so smart, Conan-kun!

117
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:35,609
You know everything!

118
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,750
Oh! It's green! Let's cross!

119
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,682
Yeah!

120
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,649
That man's been shot! That person did it!

121
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,650
Oh, no, you don't!

122
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,015
Conan-kun! Watch out!

123
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:22,012
- Call an ambulance!
- U-Understood!

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,970
Dammit! Got away!

125
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:50,177
Hang in there, Mister! Who shot you?!

126
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:57,658
What?!

127
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:24,419
At approximately 2:00 today,
at the Beika Park intersection,

128
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:28,523
Assistant Police Detective
Narasawa Osamu was shot and killed.

129
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,859
The shooter appears to have fled.

130
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,694
Assistance has been sent
from Police Headquarters,

131
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:36,698
and a task force has been
set up by the Beika Police.

132
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:42,904
I'm sorry to ask yet again, but
could you tell us about the murderer?

133
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,606
It was a young man!

134
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,309
No, it was a pretty lady!

135
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:49,878
No! It was a middle-aged man!

136
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:52,881
How about the person's umbrella?

137
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,282
It was a black umbrella!

138
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,718
It was green! Green!

139
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:58,620
I think it was blue...

140
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,624
Hey, now. Did you guys really see anything?

141
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,326
What about you, Conan-kun?

142
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:07,896
The raincoat and umbrella were gray-ish,

143
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:10,465
but I don't know if it was a man or woman.

144
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,001
But the umbrella was in their right hand!

145
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:16,571
Meaning they fired
the gun with their left hand.

146
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:18,807
So the killer is left-handed...

147
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:20,742
Incidentally, Inspector.

148
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:25,847
Why did Assistant Detective Narasawa
die holding the left side of his chest?

149
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:31,251
We believe it was meant to indicate
the police notebook in his pocket.

150
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:37,589
We're currently looking into
everything written in that notebook.

151
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,362
Inspector Megure.

152
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:46,534
The cartridges at the scene were
from a 9-mm caliber automatic.

153
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:48,670
A 9-mm caliber?

154
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,474
That's a common gun
even a woman could handle...

155
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:55,510
But it's a good thing none of you
got caught in the middle of it!

156
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,778
You too, Conan-kun!

157
00:11:56,778 --> 00:11:58,780
Yeah!

158
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,382
Damn!

159
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:04,785
If only the light hadn't turned red,
they wouldn't have gotten away!

160
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:41,956
"Another Detective Murdered!"

161
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,258
"The Work of Extremists?"
"Gangs Enacting Revenge?"

162
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:44,526
"The Mystery Deepens"
"A Personal Grudge!?"

163
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:45,686
"Challenge for Police!"

164
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,569
This is Megure.

165
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,071
Oh, Mori-kun?

166
00:12:56,071 --> 00:13:01,176
Inspector, I'd like to know
more about last night's incident...

167
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:04,873
I'm sorry. I'm busy.
Maybe some other time.

168
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,349
Hello?! Inspector?!

169
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,584
What happened?

170
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,853
Says he's busy.

171
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:16,124
Of course he is.
They've lost two of their detectives.

172
00:13:16,124 --> 00:13:22,529
Still, he seemed
different from his normal self...

173
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:26,434
Alright, Shiratori-kun.

174
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:29,604
Only you and I can
know about the incident.

175
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,538
Do not tell anyone.

176
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:34,542
Understood.

177
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:39,914
As the ballistic fingerprints of
the bullets used in the murders match,

178
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:44,874
authorities now believe these
were acts of the same individual.

179
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,053
And now for the weather.
A high pressure system will...

180
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:02,170
Still, Shiratori-san's sister
sure knows how to pick a bad time

181
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,737
"15 F - Wedding Celebration"
Still, Shiratori-san's sister
sure knows how to pick a bad time

182
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:06,674
"15 F - Wedding Celebration"
to hold a wedding reception...

183
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:07,008
to hold a wedding reception...

184
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:10,745
It can't be helped. It was
planned a month in advance,

185
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:13,314
and it's not her fault
the incidents happened.

186
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:18,353
Besides, it's not a wedding reception,
it's a wedding celebration!

187
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:21,256
The bride and groom's friends
are the ones in charge of it!

188
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:22,917
Yeah, I know!

189
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:29,197
Hey! What's the groom, Haretsuki-san, like?

190
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:31,533
Apparently, he's a painter!

191
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,935
Add "struggling" to the beginning of that.

192
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,371
A struggling painter, huh?

193
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:39,932
I guess I can't expect very
much from his guy friends...

194
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:44,177
"Mori Kogoro"

195
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,116
I see your handwriting is as blunt as ever...

196
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:49,384
Mom!

197
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:51,386
You got invited, too?

198
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:56,224
Yes. Sara-san is an
up-and-coming attorney I work with.

199
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:56,391
"Kisaki Eri"
Yes. Sara-san is an
up-and-coming attorney I work with.

200
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:58,552
"Kisaki Eri"

201
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,963
Wow! You have such great handwriting!

202
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:06,534
Geez. Don't sign in separately
if you're husband and wife.

203
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,036
Please store this for me!

204
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,698
Your number is 87!

205
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:15,410
Come on, Conan-kun!

206
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,570
Yeah!

207
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:26,154
Wow! Look at all these people!

208
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:29,055
Oh! The inspector's here!

209
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,995
It's so easy to spot members of the police.

210
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:37,899
They have menacing looks in their eyes,
and are all-around gloomy.

211
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:43,037
Can't blame 'em. This's no time
for a party, after what's happened.

212
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:46,507
Detective Sato is always cheerful, though!

213
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:48,843
Well? Fine feathers make
fine birds, wouldn't you agree?

214
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:52,614
N-Not at all! It suits you very well!

215
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:57,051
Oh! It's Odagiri-san!
I'm gonna go say hello.

216
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:01,623
- Who?
- Police Superintendent Odagiri.

217
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:05,460
He was Chief Detective when that
bonehead private eye worked there.

218
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,520
I believe he's head of
criminal investigations now.

219
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:14,936
Thank you all for your patience!
Here are the bride and groom!

220
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,700
Please greet them with
tremendous applause!

221
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:24,034
Wow! How wonderful!

222
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,090
Kotaro! Sara-san! Congratulations!

223
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,232
Mori-san.

224
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,467
Oh! Congrats!

225
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:48,403
Thank you.

226
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:50,905
Oh, let me introduce you.

227
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,907
This is my doctor, Dr. Kazato.

228
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:56,678
He's a psychiatrist at
Beika Yakushino Hospital.

229
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,980
I'm Kazato. It's nice to meet you.

230
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,415
I'm Mori.

231
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,286
This is my wife Eri, my daughter
Ran, and my moocher Conan.

232
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,422
Quit callin' me a moocher.

233
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:10,825
But Shiratori-san... A psychiatrist?

234
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:15,830
Yes, worries and concerns are always
a part of management positions.

235
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,297
Which is why...

236
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:23,938
...I think you should have him
take a look at you, Mori-san.

237
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:28,309
Yeah... Lately, my memory's been a bit...

238
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:30,777
Hey, you! What's that supposed to mean?!

239
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,317
That's enough laughing out of you!

240
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:38,286
Ouch!

241
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,554
Excuse me!

242
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:41,322
Inspector!

243
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,491
Oh, Mori-kun.

244
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,526
Have you found anything out since then?

245
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,154
I'm sorry, but I can't talk about that.

246
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:53,034
Why won't he talk to me?

247
00:17:53,034 --> 00:17:56,237
There must be something he can't tell you.

248
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,873
Hey! Is that true, Takagi?!

249
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,508
N-No, not really!

250
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:05,207
Say, Takagi-san. You like
Detective Sato, don't you?

251
00:18:06,681 --> 00:18:11,819
How interesting!
I'll go tell her how you feel!

252
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,188
H-Hold on! Wait!

253
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:15,553
Okay!

254
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:19,160
We're keeping it from the press,

255
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,231
but Detective Shiba also died
holding his police notebook...

256
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,999
What?!

257
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,401
Which means...

258
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:31,005
There is no use in prying
any further, Mori-san.

259
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:35,567
"Need not to know."
That should be clear enough.

260
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:45,586
"Need not to know..."

261
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:47,213
This can't be!

262
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:51,559
"Need not to know."

263
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,196
A special phrase used
among police detectives...

264
00:18:55,196 --> 00:19:00,532
Does this mean the killer is someone
inside the police department?!

265
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:06,240
And not just anyone...
it's someone high-ranking...

266
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,200
Or it could be the entire
police organization itself!

267
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:17,251
So he didn't say anything special to propose?

268
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,321
No, he's not good at that sort of thing.

269
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:23,658
It's better when men are like that.

270
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:28,425
Anyone who lays the flattery
on so thick is no good.

271
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:38,172
Say! I've been meaning to ask,
but how did Dad propose to you?

272
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:41,342
It was just a bunch of
over-flattery, like I said.

273
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:44,245
Sensei! Please tell us!

274
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:46,614
But I've forgotten.

275
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:49,684
Oh, you're always playing dumb!

276
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:55,356
- Please tell us, for future reference!
- C'mon! Quit teasing us, Mom!

277
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,358
Let me think...

278
00:19:57,358 --> 00:20:02,463
"I love you. More than anyone on this Earth."

279
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:03,862
Or something like that!

280
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:10,271
No way...

281
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,501
That's so nice!

282
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:20,281
"Oh, if Shinichi were to say that to me..."

283
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,383
Get that look off your face!

284
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:26,487
L-I don't have a look, Sonoko!

285
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,190
What's wrong, Ran-neechan?

286
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,158
Your face is red!

287
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:33,394
No, it's nothing!

288
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,897
Toshiya! What are you doing here?!

289
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:42,503
This is no place for the likes of you!
You weren't invited to this party!

290
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:46,474
Shut it! I just happened to come
to this hotel 'cause of work!

291
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:52,680
That's his son, Toshiya-san!
I heard he's in a rock band...

292
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,350
Now, now! It's all right, Superintendent!

293
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,353
- Toshiya-kun, enjoy yourself.
- Get out!

294
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,923
Quit prowling around like
a stray dog looking for food!

295
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:04,357
- Say what?!
- Toshiya-san!

296
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,332
Sorry to bother you!

297
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:13,163
Toshiya-kun!

298
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:23,333
Huh? Where have I seen her before?

299
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:35,549
Sato-kun.

300
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:39,293
About you-know-what...

301
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:41,963
- No, I'm fine!
- But...

302
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:45,023
- There's no need to worry!
- Hey, now!

303
00:21:52,907 --> 00:21:55,467
- #38, please.
- Right!

304
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,234
- Oh! Ran-chan!
- Detective Sato!

305
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:23,838
Such a weird party, isn't it?
With all those police...

306
00:22:23,838 --> 00:22:27,742
Not really. But please be careful, okay?

307
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:28,943
Eh?

308
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:32,413
Police detectives are being
shot one after the other...

309
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:35,473
I'll be fine! I'm tough!

310
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,027
Huh?

311
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:47,828
A blackout?

312
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:51,032
- What do you suppose happened?
- That's strange.

313
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:53,432
I'll go look around. Stay here.

314
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,476
Detective Sato! There's a flashlight here!

315
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:04,876
See?

316
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,110
No, Ran-san!

317
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,610
Detective Sato!

318
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,012
Detective Sato...

319
00:23:38,012 --> 00:23:40,572
Detective Sato! Say something!

320
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:53,249
It's... It's because
I picked up the flashlight...

321
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:05,372
- Ran!
- Sato-san!

322
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:07,541
Hey! Ran! Are you alright?!

323
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,238
Ran-neechan is only unconscious!
The injured one is...

324
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,704
Sato-san! Sato-san! Please say something!

325
00:24:16,717 --> 00:24:17,852
W-What on earth?!

326
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:22,890
Megure! Call an ambulance! Shiratori!
Seal all of the hotel's exits!

327
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,891
Yes, sir!

328
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:27,261
Hello?! I'm on the 15th floor
of the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel!

329
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:30,631
A woman has been shot!
Please send an ambulance immediately!

330
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:32,633
It's out of bullets...

331
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:37,705
A 9-mm caliber automatic!
It's the same person!

332
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:40,936
But... why is there a flashlight?

333
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:44,211
Hurry!

334
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:45,940
Seal off all exits!

335
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:06,433
Test everyone but the children
for traces of gunpowder!

336
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:09,937
No exceptions! That includes
me and every officer here!

337
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:12,929
And this fool too, of course!

338
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:20,514
That guy's still here?

339
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:24,610
But I don't see those two...

340
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:30,353
"In Surgery"

341
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:41,769
Inspector Megure.
What is Sato-san's condition?

342
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:44,705
One of the bullets stopped
right next to her heart.

343
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:48,809
They say she only has a 50-50
chance of pulling through...

344
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,645
Inspector, what about Ran?

345
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:56,217
Luckily, she suffered no external injuries,
but she's still unconscious.

346
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:58,651
She's in the room at the far end.

347
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:04,625
Ran is probably all right.

348
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,459
But I'm curious about that flashlight...

349
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,532
Could it have been...

350
00:26:11,532 --> 00:26:13,734
Shiratori-kun, how is the investigation going?

351
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:17,671
We checked everyone for traces
of gunpowder, but we found nothing.

352
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:19,640
Nothing?!

353
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,845
We believe the shooter fled the
building before the exits were sealed.

354
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,582
- Any fingerprints on the gun?!
- Nothing there, either.

355
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:32,586
Chiba-kun, did you figure out
how the switchboard was rigged?

356
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:38,158
Yes. It appears it was set to
explode via a cell phone call.

357
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:41,262
There's something that has me curious.

358
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:46,700
The flashlight on the bathroom floor...
Did it belong to Sato-san?

359
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,203
I don't think so!

360
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:52,573
The cabinet doors under the vanity were open.

361
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:56,343
It was probably left in there...
with its light on.

362
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:58,913
What?! Then the shooter...

363
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:04,385
I see! Nobody would've noticed
it when the lights were on!

364
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:09,890
There's almost no question this is
related to "the" incident, then.

365
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,792
What's "the" incident?!

366
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,093
No, uhh...

367
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:19,133
Why won't you tell me?!
One misstep and Ran could've been shot!

368
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,701
Inspector!

369
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,270
- I have terrible news! It's Ran!
- What about her?!

370
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,807
She's conscious again,
but she's acting strange!

371
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,138
What?!

372
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,115
Ran-neechan!

373
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:43,551
Are you all right, Ran-neechan?

374
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,124
Who are you... little boy?

375
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,472
W-Whoa, now...

376
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:05,079
She can't even remember
her own name, much less us...

377
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:09,583
That can't be!
I'm Mori Kogoro, your father!

378
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,575
She's Kisaki Eri, your mother!

379
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:18,088
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

380
00:28:21,161 --> 00:28:22,458
Ran...

381
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,776
Dr. Kazato, I'm sorry to bother you like this,

382
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:38,768
but there weren't any
psychiatrists on duty, so...

383
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:44,509
Do you know who you are?

384
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,293
Then, do you remember
what happened today?

385
00:28:53,293 --> 00:28:54,528
No.

386
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:56,797
What's the capital of the United States?

387
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:58,665
Washington, D.C.

388
00:28:58,665 --> 00:29:00,501
What's 5 times 8?

389
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,002
40.

390
00:29:02,002 --> 00:29:04,800
Please click this ballpoint pen.

391
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:15,849
"Conference Room 4"

392
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:17,451
"Conference Room 4"
Retrograde amnesia?

393
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:17,751
Retrograde amnesia?

394
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:21,755
Yes. It's a type of memory disorder
in which sudden illness or injury

395
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:26,560
leaves the sufferer unable to remember
anything prior to the infliction.

396
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,999
In your daughter's case, I believe
she received a strong mental shock

397
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:35,869
after witnessing Detective Sato
being shot before her very eyes.

398
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:39,339
So, will my daughter's memory return?!

399
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,176
I can't say anything at this point in time.

400
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:48,115
But I found no problems with her
knowledge about everyday life.

401
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:51,718
So she can live a normal life, then?!

402
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:58,592
Yes. But let's keep her here for
observation for a few more days.

403
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:01,595
It's only natural that
Ran would be shocked

404
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:06,066
if a detective she knew was
shot right in front of her...

405
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:12,072
But there had to be more to it than
that for her to lose her memory!

406
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:16,907
Something that would
pierce her mind even more!

407
00:30:29,056 --> 00:30:31,892
They've finished operating on Sato-san.

408
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,495
They managed to remove the bullet,

409
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:37,293
but it's hard to say
if she'll survive or not...

410
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:40,634
I see...

411
00:30:40,634 --> 00:30:45,936
Inspector! You still won't say
anything, even after all this?!

412
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:51,678
Shiratori! You know, too! Tell me!

413
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:55,315
We will arrest the person
responsible ourselves.

414
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,284
Damn it!

415
00:30:57,284 --> 00:30:59,353
Say, Detective Chiba.

416
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:02,923
Did you check for fingerprints
on the flashlight in the bathroom?

417
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:08,962
Yeah. But we only found Ran-san's fingerprints.

418
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:13,967
We all assumed it was Sato-san
who had the flashlight,

419
00:31:13,967 --> 00:31:16,537
but it appears it was actually Ran-san.

420
00:31:16,537 --> 00:31:22,042
In which case, Ran would've felt
it was her fault Sato-san was shot.

421
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:27,537
And it's because of that shock
that she lost her memory?!

422
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:29,944
Ran...

423
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:42,563
Even if your memory
never comes back, I'll always...

424
00:31:42,563 --> 00:31:44,656
...be your friend...

425
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,996
I'll tell you everything.

426
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,313
But, Inspector Megure! That's...

427
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:05,047
It's okay. If I get fired, I'll just
open a detective agency like Mori-kun.

428
00:32:07,354 --> 00:32:08,989
Inspector...

429
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:11,391
Takagi-kun, watch Sato-kun.

430
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:13,393
Chiba-kun, you watch Ran-kun.

431
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:16,029
If anything happens, report immediately.

432
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,053
Yes, sir!

433
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:24,938
Last summer, the body of Jinno Tamotsu,

434
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:29,543
a doctor at Toto University
Hospital's 1st Dept. Of Surgery,

435
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:32,279
was found in his apartment.

436
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,617
The investigation was headed
by Inspector Tomonari,

437
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:40,187
my superior in Investigation Section 1.

438
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:44,758
Under him were Narasawa and Shiba,
who've been shot and killed.

439
00:32:44,758 --> 00:32:47,761
Sato-kun was also working with them.

440
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:53,433
Mr. Jinno drank a lot of alcohol
and then cut his right jugular vein

441
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,937
with his own scalpel.

442
00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:58,772
He died of blood loss.

443
00:32:58,772 --> 00:33:01,775
The first person to find him
was his sister Tamaki-san,

444
00:33:01,775 --> 00:33:05,445
an investigative reporter
who lives in a neighboring town.

445
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:07,447
Old man! She's...

446
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,483
She was at the hotel party!

447
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:14,087
Now I remember!
She came to see me once before!

448
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:16,089
Eh? She went to your office?

449
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:19,593
What did she tell you then?

450
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:23,163
Actually, I was quite intoxicated at the time,

451
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:29,436
so I can't remember what
she talked to me about at all...

452
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:33,073
I remember the incident
with this Jinno person!

453
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:36,076
Didn't the family of a patient
sue him for botching an operation

454
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,779
a few days before he died?

455
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,480
That's right.

456
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,485
He left a final message on his
word processor, apologizing for it,

457
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:50,290
so Inspector Tomonari concluded
it was most likely a suicide.

458
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,495
But his sister, Tamaki-san, disagreed.

459
00:33:55,495 --> 00:34:00,934
She said he was a terrible doctor
who never cared about his patients,

460
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:05,839
and that he'd never kill himself
to apologize for a botched operation.

461
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:10,844
And a week before,
she apparently saw him arguing

462
00:34:10,844 --> 00:34:15,682
with a purple-haired young
man in front of a warehouse.

463
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:18,118
Purple hair?!

464
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:23,056
Just to be sure, Inspector Tomonari
took Sato, Narasawa, and Shiba

465
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:25,024
to the warehouse.

466
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:31,695
It was a particularly hot day,
with temperatures topping 35Â°C [95Â°F].

467
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:37,537
It's locked!

468
00:34:37,537 --> 00:34:38,905
Alright! Let's stake it out!

469
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:41,135
- You're over there, Shiba-kun!
- Yes, sir!

470
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:51,716
I can't believe this heat...

471
00:34:53,353 --> 00:34:55,989
What's wrong, Inspector?!

472
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:59,159
He's having a heart attack! Call an ambulance!

473
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,148
Right!

474
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:04,097
- Don't!
- Eh?!

475
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:07,567
- We're in the middle of a stakeout!
- But...

476
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,002
I'll be fine!

477
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:12,038
I'll take a cab to the hospital!

478
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:15,098
Keep... watching the place!

479
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:23,209
But before long, Sato-kun
grew worried and went to look...

480
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,777
Inspector Tomonari!

481
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:39,399
Sato-kun took Inspector Tomonari
straight to Toto University Hospital.

482
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:45,031
However, he died during surgery...

483
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:50,477
- Sato-san's been gone a long time...
- Yeah...

484
00:35:50,477 --> 00:35:51,603
Here he comes!

485
00:35:55,615 --> 00:35:59,244
Damn, it's hot today!

486
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,888
- Let's go!
- Wait!

487
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:04,424
Do you know who that man is?!

488
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:05,948
Huh?

489
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:12,158
He's Superintendent Odagiri's son, Toshiya-san!

490
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:18,805
In the end, with Inspector
Tomonari's sudden death,

491
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:24,511
Jinno Tamotsu's death was deemed
a suicide, and the case closed.

492
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:28,114
His sister Tamaki-san
checked the guy out,

493
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:32,252
but Detective Shiba told her
he was unrelated to the case.

494
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:34,988
So that's what happened?

495
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:40,360
Incidentally, Inspector Tomonari
had a son named Makoto...

496
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,164
Oh! He was at the party!

497
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:45,866
He disappeared soon after, though...

498
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:47,701
Does he have something to do with this?

499
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:50,829
Yeah. It happened at the wake.

500
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:57,811
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

501
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:01,681
My father might still be alive if you had!

502
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,818
No, we only did what he said...

503
00:37:04,818 --> 00:37:10,450
You're the ones who killed my father!
I'll never forgive you for this!

504
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:17,330
- Here you go, Conan-kun.
- Thanks.

505
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,333
Shortly after, both Detective
Narasawa and Detective Shiba

506
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,335
were transferred to
the district police station.

507
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:27,307
But Shiratori-kun noticed that
Sato-kun had started investigating

508
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:29,910
something on her own just recently.

509
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,648
She, Detective Narasawa, and Detective Shiba

510
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:37,344
started to re-investigate
that case from one year ago.

511
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:50,330
But it seems Sato-san wasn't
informed about the relationship

512
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,899
between Toshiya-kun and Jinno.

513
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:59,272
Detective Narasawa was
shot and killed shortly after.

514
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:02,342
Then, after Detective Shiba was killed too,

515
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:08,515
we realized they were targeted
because of the case one year ago.

516
00:38:08,515 --> 00:38:10,283
From the police notebooks,

517
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:13,453
we deduced the killer was
connected to the police somehow.

518
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:17,891
Detective Takagi investigated the
inspector's son, Tomonari Makoto,

519
00:38:17,891 --> 00:38:22,794
and I investigated the
superintendent's son, Toshiya-kun.

520
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,572
I felt there was a good chance
Sato-kun would be targeted next,

521
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:36,810
so I told her to have someone guard her...

522
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,913
...but she declined.

523
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:45,118
So that's why you talked
to her at the party, too?

524
00:38:45,118 --> 00:38:46,813
Yes.

525
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:53,827
I've figured it out, Inspector!
The killer is Odagiri Toshiya!

526
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:57,831
Detectives Narasawa, Shiba, and
Sato had started to re-investigate

527
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:01,768
Jinno's case from last year,
so he decided to strike first!

528
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:05,572
But he wasn't the one who shot Sato-kun.

529
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:08,575
We found no traces of gunpowder on him.

530
00:39:08,575 --> 00:39:10,577
Oh. I see.

531
00:39:10,577 --> 00:39:15,148
More important is Tomonari Makoto.
We're unable to locate him.

532
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:20,420
Plus, he was seen nearby when
Narasawa and Shiba were shot.

533
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,624
And, given that he was at today's party...

534
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:29,529
We do know the killer
is left-handed, though...

535
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:33,366
C-Come to think of it,
Tomonari Makoto is left-handed, too!

536
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:36,002
Alright! Put Tomonari Makoto
on the wanted list!

537
00:39:36,002 --> 00:39:37,264
Yes, sir!

538
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:45,045
Say, Inspector. How was this
Jinno person's jugular vein cut?

539
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:50,617
How? He was cut on the right side,
straight from top to bottom.

540
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:56,389
Then, if it was a murder,
his killer might've been left-handed.

541
00:39:56,389 --> 00:39:59,459
- Eh?
- And how do you know that?!

542
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:02,629
- After all...
- To avoid being covered in blood.

543
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:05,465
To do that...

544
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:09,369
...you'd have to cut the right
jugular vein with your left hand.

545
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,304
Right, Conan-kun?

546
00:40:11,304 --> 00:40:12,972
Y-Yeah.

547
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:14,307
I see!

548
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:18,545
No, but there's no connection
between Tomonari Makoto and Jinno.

549
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:23,683
If Jinno was murdered, it must've
been a different left-handed killer.

550
00:40:23,683 --> 00:40:27,987
Toshiya-san is left-handed, too.
He lit a match with his left hand.

551
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:32,525
There's another. His father,
Superintendent Odagiri.

552
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:34,661
He's left-handed, too.

553
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:39,733
Don't be stupid! He couldn't
possibly be the killer!

554
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,894
L-Inspector?

555
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,711
"Beika Yakushino Hospital"

556
00:41:19,572 --> 00:41:21,641
I'm Yoshida Ayumi!

557
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:26,579
Kojima Genta-kun, Tsuburaya
Mitsuhiko-kun, and Haibara Ai-san!

558
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,581
We're all Conan-kun's friends,

559
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:31,651
and we came because we're worried about you.

560
00:41:31,651 --> 00:41:36,756
Thank you. But, I'm sorry.
I don't remember any of you.

561
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,292
No! I can't believe this!

562
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,995
You always played with us!

563
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:46,499
Do you not remember me, either?
I'm Agasa Hiroshi.

564
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:50,503
You know, the brilliant
scientist who lives next door

565
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:54,607
to your childhood friend
and classmate, Kudo Shinichi-kun!

566
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:58,678
Kudo... Shinichi?

567
00:41:58,678 --> 00:42:01,347
You remember Shinichi-niichan?!

568
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:03,611
No... I don't.

569
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:06,783
Oh.

570
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:16,763
What is it, Haibara?

571
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:20,426
It felt like someone was
staring at us just now...

572
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:27,697
Must be my imagination.

573
00:42:35,148 --> 00:42:37,784
I'm sorry. I'm a little tired.

574
00:42:37,784 --> 00:42:40,810
That's okay. Get some rest.

575
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:43,682
Who's there?!

576
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:51,030
Damn!

577
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,032
What is it, Conan?

578
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:56,636
Old man! Do you think Ran-neechan
could've seen the killer's face

579
00:42:56,636 --> 00:42:58,972
when Detective Sato was shot?!

580
00:42:58,972 --> 00:42:59,973
What?!

581
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:04,706
If so, then the killer
might try to go after her!

582
00:43:09,582 --> 00:43:11,150
I've been waiting for you.

583
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:16,022
Rest easy. Takagi-kun and Chiba-kun
will take turns guarding her.

584
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:16,723
Where is she now?

585
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:20,660
- My husband's with her.
- Alright. Let's go.

586
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,196
- Um, Kisaki-san?
- Yes?

587
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:27,867
Dr. Kazato says he'd like to
talk to you about your daughter.

588
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:32,065
Her MRI scan shows
no damage to the brain.

589
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:36,676
It appears your
daughter's amnesia occurred

590
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:40,713
as a way to save herself
from mental trauma.

591
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:45,752
Meaning if we take her to that
hotel and recreate the incident,

592
00:43:45,752 --> 00:43:47,687
she'll regain her memory?

593
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:49,522
What are you talking about?!

594
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:53,860
There's no need to make her recall
something she doesn't want to!

595
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,730
Are you saying you don't care if
she never gets her memory back?!

596
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,234
I'm against anything
that makes her suffer!

597
00:44:01,234 --> 00:44:07,740
Now, now. Forcing her to remember
something could harm her brain.

598
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,105
See?

599
00:44:11,644 --> 00:44:12,804
Pardon me.

600
00:44:13,913 --> 00:44:15,904
This is Kazato.

601
00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:20,887
Okay. Understood. I'll give him a call.

602
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:24,791
If Ran did see the killer's face,
she's in danger

603
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:29,829
unless we restore her memory
and catch the person ASAP!

604
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:35,101
But just like the doctor says,
we can't force her to remember...

605
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:39,305
I'll just have to protect Ran myself!

606
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:42,775
Huh? He won't answer.

607
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:44,477
Sorry about that.

608
00:44:44,477 --> 00:44:50,850
Doctor, is there any way to
restore her memory naturally?

609
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:56,356
It's common for people to suddenly
remember things while relaxed.

610
00:44:56,356 --> 00:44:57,957
Understood.

611
00:44:57,957 --> 00:45:00,760
Once Ran checks out,
I'm living in your office too.

612
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,028
What?!

613
00:45:02,028 --> 00:45:06,766
I can take care of her that way,
and help her relax.

614
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:10,303
This isn't a joke!
You'll only stress me out more!

615
00:45:10,303 --> 00:45:14,807
I don't care what happens to you!
This is all for Ran's sake!

616
00:45:14,807 --> 00:45:15,774
Got that?!

617
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:19,301
This won't be good...

618
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,490
Ran-san, please don't push yourself
too hard to remember anything.

619
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,791
Okay?

620
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,793
Yes.

621
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:36,829
Please contact me if any
of her memory returns.

622
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:38,626
Understood.

623
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:46,406
You've lived in this town 17 years,
since you were born.

624
00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:48,203
Recognize it?

625
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,087
This is your home.

626
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:04,989
"Mori Detective Agency..."

627
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:08,054
You'll get wet.

628
00:46:11,197 --> 00:46:12,824
What's wrong, Ran?

629
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:19,372
She must not like puddles.

630
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:23,331
There was a lot of water when
Detective Sato was shot, too, so...

631
00:46:24,844 --> 00:46:26,746
Pull up a little.

632
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:27,940
Right.

633
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:34,053
The second floor is the office.

634
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:37,545
I'm always solving difficult
cases at that desk there!

635
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:42,055
All you do there is drink beer and watch TV.

636
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,268
Here on the third floor is
the living room and the kitchen.

637
00:46:49,268 --> 00:46:51,793
And over here is your room.

638
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:12,492
His name's Kudo Shinichi.

639
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:16,496
He's a real jerk who's trying to seduce you!

640
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:19,226
I'm not tryin' to seduce anyone!

641
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:23,936
Oh! You practice karate, Ran-neechan!

642
00:47:23,936 --> 00:47:26,439
I know karate?

643
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:31,744
You won the city high school
championship! You don't remember?

644
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:33,613
No.

645
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:35,012
Oh.

646
00:47:36,816 --> 00:47:41,020
But don't worry! I'll remember
everything sooner or later!

647
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,323
Yeah! Let's have something
good to eat tonight

648
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:46,025
to celebrate Ran getting out of the hospital!

649
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:49,859
In that case, maybe I'll cook
something up for old times' sake!

650
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:55,134
Oh? What's with you two?

651
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:58,304
W-W-What do you mean?
Y-Y-Your cooking...

652
00:47:58,304 --> 00:48:03,042
I don't need any, then! I'm not hungry...

653
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:06,045
You don't need to hold back
to be polite, Conan-kun.

654
00:48:06,045 --> 00:48:13,619
I'll work hard to make some scrumptious,
yummy beef stew for you!

655
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,954
That's the worst of all...

656
00:48:14,954 --> 00:48:17,957
Huh? Where are you going, dear?

657
00:48:17,957 --> 00:48:22,562
No, uhh, I completely forgot
that I promised to play Mahjong

658
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:24,697
with the neighbors tonight!

659
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:29,869
This is no time for Mahjong,
when your daughter is like this!

660
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:34,704
Or, what? Are you saying
you can't eat my cooking?

661
00:48:45,985 --> 00:48:49,989
Whew! Ran's more cheerful than I thought!

662
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:51,581
She'll definitely be okay!

663
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:24,219
Ran...

664
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:37,103
Bodyguards? Mine?

665
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:41,870
We heard from Detective Takagi
that the killer might come after you!

666
00:49:43,643 --> 00:49:48,381
We, the Junior Detective League,
have decided to protect you!

667
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:49,780
We call ourselves...

668
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:54,444
...the Ran-neechan Protection Squad!

669
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:57,156
Oh, geez...

670
00:49:57,156 --> 00:50:00,660
I brought a squirt gun filled with hot sauce!

671
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,595
I brought a boomerang!

672
00:50:02,595 --> 00:50:04,463
And I got handcuffs!

673
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:08,234
C'mon, now. Those kids' toys won't help...

674
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:11,931
Thanks, guys! I feel much safer!

675
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:18,110
As thanks, I'll treat you to
something nice and cold! Come on up!

676
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,613
Okay!

677
00:50:20,613 --> 00:50:23,182
Hurray!

678
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:25,618
She still can't remember anything?

679
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,286
Nope.

680
00:50:27,286 --> 00:50:32,124
Wouldn't it be better for you
if her memory never comes back?

681
00:50:32,124 --> 00:50:33,092
Eh?

682
00:50:33,092 --> 00:50:37,863
There'd be no need to worry about
her learning who you really are.

683
00:50:37,863 --> 00:50:40,700
W-What did you say?!

684
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,206
If I could, I'd want
to lose my memory, too!

685
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:49,709
My sister's murder,

686
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:53,979
me joining the organization
and creating the poison...

687
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:57,717
How nice it would be to forget
everything and become Haibara Ai,

688
00:50:57,717 --> 00:51:01,220
just an ordinary grade-schooler...

689
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,346
And then...

690
00:51:04,056 --> 00:51:06,115
you and I...

691
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:11,731
...could always stay together...

692
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:15,668
Haibara... Are you...

693
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:19,035
Gotcha! Feeling any better?

694
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:23,876
Hi, Squirt!

695
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,878
Your new girlfriend?

696
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,346
And another annoying one shows up...

697
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:36,155
See! These are from when you
won the city karate championship!

698
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:37,556
Do you remember?

699
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:39,251
No.

700
00:51:41,527 --> 00:51:43,262
He's...

701
00:51:43,262 --> 00:51:46,265
Oh, Kudo-kun! He's your beau!

702
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:48,699
I'm not her beau!

703
00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:53,105
She seems to recognize him.

704
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:55,341
Really, Ran-neechan?!

705
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,410
No.

706
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,245
- But...
- But?!

707
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:03,682
...I feel very nostalgic for some reason.

708
00:52:03,682 --> 00:52:06,173
I don't know why, though.

709
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:11,924
Hey! Won't she remember
if she sees Shinichi-san?

710
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:13,926
Yeah! Bring him here!

711
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:17,263
I would if I could!

712
00:52:17,263 --> 00:52:20,599
Say, he's the high school
detective who solves tough cases

713
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,435
all around the country, right?

714
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:27,896
I can't believe him! Where in the
world is he, while Ran's like this?!

715
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:51,497
Yes?

716
00:52:51,497 --> 00:52:54,166
Ran-neechan, the bath's empty now.

717
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,234
Thanks.

718
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:59,438
Tell me, Conan-kun.
What's Kudo Shinichi like?

719
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:01,607
What's he like?

720
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:06,178
I think he probably thinks about you the most,

721
00:53:06,178 --> 00:53:10,581
but can't just come out and say how he feels.

722
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:16,444
I think I'd like to meet him...

723
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:21,193
Hey, Ran. Want to go Ginza tomorrow?

724
00:53:21,193 --> 00:53:22,261
Eh?

725
00:53:22,261 --> 00:53:25,831
I get so annoyed when I'm around that man!

726
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,801
So let's go on a shopping spree to feel better!

727
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:31,003
You too, Conan-kun!

728
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:32,436
Yeah!

729
00:53:50,823 --> 00:53:53,225
Are you all right?

730
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:57,296
Sato-san! Sato-san! Please say something!

731
00:53:57,296 --> 00:53:59,031
Thank you!

732
00:53:59,031 --> 00:54:01,033
Uhh...

733
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,898
Damn it!

734
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,327
Here it comes.

735
00:54:15,414 --> 00:54:16,403
Ran!

736
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:20,810
Ran!

737
00:54:31,931 --> 00:54:34,263
"Beika Yakushino Hospital"

738
00:54:39,772 --> 00:54:44,009
- Ran!
- Shh! He just gave her a sedative.

739
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:45,878
Is Ran alright?!

740
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:48,681
Only a few scratches, thankfully.

741
00:54:48,681 --> 00:54:56,088
But I'm concerned this may make
her afraid of regaining her memory.

742
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:59,124
Takagi! What were you watching?!

743
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:00,292
I'm sorry!

744
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,362
But now we know for sure.

745
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:10,202
When Sato-kun was shot,
Ran-kun did see the shooter's face.

746
00:55:10,202 --> 00:55:13,572
Listen! No matter what happens,
we must keep Ran-kun safe!

747
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:14,373
Yes, sir!

748
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:18,776
Keeping her safe isn't enough.
We have to go on the offensive!

749
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,892
After it happened, no one tested
positive for traces of gunpowder.

750
00:55:33,892 --> 00:55:38,955
Is it really impossible to fire
a gun and leave no gunpowder traces?

751
00:55:40,432 --> 00:55:41,831
Wait a minute!

752
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,505
If I remember right...

753
00:55:46,505 --> 00:55:49,975
...that umbrella was buttoned up!

754
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:52,411
And after the incident...

755
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:56,482
...it was not only unbuttoned,
but in a different location, too!

756
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:59,076
And then, after Ran left the hospital...

757
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,325
Could it be?!

758
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:09,161
Eh? That was your umbrella, little boy?

759
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:11,263
Do you know where it is now?

760
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,933
I'm sorry. There was a hole
in it, so I threw it away.

761
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,435
Eh?!

762
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:20,606
I should've figured, after all this time...

763
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:25,444
No, I'm just kidding! I saved it!

764
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:27,212
Oh, geez...

765
00:56:27,212 --> 00:56:28,645
Thanks!

766
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:36,221
Just as I thought!

767
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:41,318
I found the way to fire a gun
without leaving gunpowder traces!

768
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:47,132
It's not just Tomonari Makoto-san
and Jinno Tamaki-san now!

769
00:56:47,132 --> 00:56:52,468
This makes even Toshiya-san,
and everyone at the party, a suspect!

770
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:04,809
This is it!

771
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:33,612
Now I see!

772
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:39,573
Tamaki-san was at the party
because she was tailing Toshiya!

773
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:48,117
Dammit! Why're you following
me around day after day?!

774
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:51,730
Does it bother you?

775
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,931
What?!

776
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:55,934
I'm going to find the proof
that you murdered him

777
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:58,926
in place of the two
police detectives you killed!

778
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,388
Trying to entrap him?

779
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:23,295
You're Jinno Tamotsu-san's sister,
Tamaki-san, right?

780
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:28,767
You found out he was the guy
arguing with your brother a year ago,

781
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:31,470
and that he didn't get interrogated

782
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,633
because his father's the
police superintendent, right?

783
00:58:35,674 --> 00:58:38,410
Who are you, little boy?

784
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,613
Edogawa Conan. A detective.

785
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:43,582
Detective?

786
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:46,919
If you really did love your brother,

787
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:51,590
you might've held a grudge
against the three police detectives

788
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:55,527
who called your brother's
death a suicide and moved on.

789
00:58:55,527 --> 00:58:57,963
I hated my brother!

790
00:58:57,963 --> 00:59:02,701
I'm only investigating what
happened to know the truth!

791
00:59:02,701 --> 00:59:07,606
Then let's take a risk and
raid the enemy's home base!

792
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:09,198
Eh?

793
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:22,651
He's trying out his sword
with an iai technique!

794
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:30,318
Whoa!

795
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:37,402
Jinno Tamaki-san, yes?

796
00:59:37,402 --> 00:59:41,006
I have something for you.

797
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:42,641
For me?

798
00:59:42,641 --> 00:59:47,305
I found it a month ago,
in my son Toshiya's room.

799
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,149
T. Jinno...

800
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:52,484
This is my brother's?

801
00:59:52,484 --> 00:59:53,752
Yes.

802
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:58,757
I remembered the name, as it was
from Inspector Tomonari's last case

803
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:03,262
before he suddenly died
of a heart attack a year ago.

804
01:00:03,262 --> 01:00:05,564
When I pressed Toshiya about it,

805
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:09,368
he confessed he learned Tamotsu-san
was selling drugs on the side,

806
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:13,672
and blackmailed him for it and money.

807
01:00:13,672 --> 01:00:19,711
However, Toshiya wasn't in any
of the investigation documents.

808
01:00:19,711 --> 01:00:24,750
So I ordered Detective Narasawa
to re-investigate the case.

809
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:30,722
Eh?! You, yourself,
ordered the re-investigation?!

810
01:00:30,722 --> 01:00:35,961
After Detective Narasawa was killed,
Inspector Megure took over.

811
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:40,732
But if Detective Narasawa had
started re-investigating on his own,

812
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:45,294
you might've tried to keep
your son out of the picture, right?

813
01:00:49,908 --> 01:00:55,213
Indeed, I also have a motive
for murdering all three.

814
01:00:55,213 --> 01:00:58,750
Say, if you're serious
about uncovering the truth,

815
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,752
let me see the investigation documents!

816
01:01:00,752 --> 01:01:02,921
I can't do that!

817
01:01:02,921 --> 01:01:08,052
Uncovering the truth is
the job of us, the police!

818
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:12,664
But it's a real relief
that you weren't hurt!

819
01:01:12,664 --> 01:01:17,124
Thank you. The doctor says I can leave now.

820
01:01:18,236 --> 01:01:20,238
Say, Sonoko-san.

821
01:01:20,238 --> 01:01:23,342
Quit that! Just "Sonoko" is fine!

822
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:25,911
What kind of boy is Conan-kun?

823
01:01:25,911 --> 01:01:26,912
Eh?

824
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:30,816
He risked his life to save mine...

825
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:38,290
Yeah. He's strange.
He's real quick-witted for a kid.

826
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:42,995
Though if you ask me,
he's just an ordinary little brat!

827
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,826
I see.

828
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:51,336
Tropical Land's newly added
"Island of Wild and Ancient Times"

829
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,939
will undoubtedly thrill patrons!

830
01:01:53,939 --> 01:01:57,275
I know that place...

831
01:01:57,275 --> 01:02:00,312
Tropical Land?

832
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:04,806
Yeah! You and Shinichi-kun
went there together!

833
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:07,219
"Psychiatric Examination Room"

834
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:08,653
"Psychiatric Examination Room"
I see.

835
01:02:08,653 --> 01:02:09,388
I see.

836
01:02:09,388 --> 01:02:12,357
Your memory's very close to returning.

837
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:19,231
Doctor, if she actually visits
Tropical Land, will her memory return?

838
01:02:19,231 --> 01:02:21,466
Yes, it is possible.

839
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:24,803
- I'll go there tomorrow.
- Eh?

840
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:30,175
Wait! I'm against this!
The killer might go after you again,

841
01:02:30,175 --> 01:02:34,012
and it'll hurt you if
you remember the incident!

842
01:02:34,012 --> 01:02:38,850
To be honest, I'm afraid of
remembering the incident myself.

843
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,853
But I can't stay like this.

844
01:02:41,853 --> 01:02:45,857
I need to take that first step forward.

845
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:47,259
Ran...

846
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:50,662
You certainly are courageous, Ran-san!

847
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:55,434
With your outlook, you should
be fine if you visit Tropical Land!

848
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:58,737
Then could you at least wait
until the day after tomorrow?

849
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:00,439
I have work tomorrow. I can't...

850
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:02,941
Quit worrying! I'll go with her!

851
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:07,045
I'll put my life on the line to protect Ran!

852
01:03:07,045 --> 01:03:09,548
Dear...

853
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:11,583
Ran! I'm coming, too!

854
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,951
Thanks!

855
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:16,388
But keep it a secret from Conan-kun.

856
01:03:16,388 --> 01:03:18,056
Eh?

857
01:03:18,056 --> 01:03:21,693
I think he'll come for sure if we tell him.

858
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:26,357
And I don't want to put
him in any more danger.

859
01:03:27,866 --> 01:03:29,595
Alright.

860
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,075
- It got late so fast!
- Yeah.

861
01:03:37,075 --> 01:03:38,276
Conan-kun.

862
01:03:38,276 --> 01:03:41,880
If you wanna see the investigation
documents, I have copies.

863
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,914
Really?!

864
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:45,283
I am an investigative reporter!

865
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,819
They're in my apartment,
so I'll show 'em to you tomorrow.

866
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:49,116
Okay!

867
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:56,318
I'll be back later!

868
01:04:00,899 --> 01:04:03,502
There he goes! Little does he know!

869
01:04:03,502 --> 01:04:06,062
Okay! Let's head out, too!

870
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:14,813
Yes! Ran-oneesan is leaving!

871
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:17,949
Keeping watch all morning was worth it!

872
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:20,452
Do you suppose Edogawa-kun wasn't informed?

873
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:24,122
That's fine by me!
He's always beating us to the punch!

874
01:04:24,122 --> 01:04:27,922
Listen, now! Nothing dangerous!

875
01:04:39,037 --> 01:04:41,096
Follow the car in front of us!

876
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:53,485
Well? Figure anything out, Detective?

877
01:04:53,485 --> 01:04:56,488
This notebook Detective Shiba is holding...

878
01:04:56,488 --> 01:04:58,557
What about it?

879
01:04:58,557 --> 01:05:00,959
If he pulled it from his breast pocket,

880
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:04,996
wouldn't his notebook
be turned the other way?

881
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:09,000
It's like so, and when you pull it
out of the pocket... You're right!

882
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,739
It's possible the killer pulled
the notebook out, not Detective Shiba!

883
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:19,904
Eh?! L-I see. That is possible.

884
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,348
Huh?

885
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:24,983
I'll find it!

886
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:28,386
I thought you were right-handed, Tamaki-san?

887
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:34,025
Eh? Oh, I was originally left-handed,
but switched to right-handed.

888
01:05:34,025 --> 01:05:37,162
So when I'm thinking or smoking or whatever,

889
01:05:37,162 --> 01:05:40,398
I sometimes use my left
hand without realizing it!

890
01:05:40,398 --> 01:05:42,701
Without realizing it?

891
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:45,101
Come to think of it, back then...

892
01:05:46,338 --> 01:05:49,330
Wait a minute! Does that mean...

893
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:54,401
Could it be?!

894
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:58,041
Is that what it meant?!

895
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,121
Say! Your brother worked at
Toto University Hospital, right?

896
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:08,093
Yeah, but I'm sorry, Conan-kun.
I have somewhere I have to go.

897
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:10,084
- That's all for today.
- Eh?

898
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:19,604
Bye, Conan-kun!

899
01:06:19,604 --> 01:06:20,805
Tropical Land.

900
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:22,136
You got it!

901
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,729
I remember this place...

902
01:06:44,729 --> 01:06:48,066
As I recall, when Shinichi
came here with you,

903
01:06:48,066 --> 01:06:51,636
he solved a murder that
happened on a roller coaster.

904
01:06:51,636 --> 01:06:54,339
Then let's ride it!

905
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:56,808
You might remember some more stuff!

906
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,076
Let's see...

907
01:06:58,076 --> 01:07:03,810
The Mystery Coaster is on the
Island of Mystery and Fantasy.

908
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:09,345
You two take the front seat.

909
01:07:15,927 --> 01:07:20,632
So you see? Conan Doyle
must've wanted to say this!

910
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:21,621
Huh?

911
01:07:23,101 --> 01:07:25,126
No, nothing!

912
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:36,147
Oh! There's Ran-oneesan and the others!

913
01:07:36,147 --> 01:07:38,183
Bah! I wanna ride it...

914
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,218
What are you talking about?!

915
01:07:40,218 --> 01:07:44,723
We need to use this time to look
around for anyone suspicious!

916
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:46,953
- Let's go!
- Alright!

917
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,465
Say, wasn't Mori-kun afraid of heights?

918
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:57,731
Oh, no! T-Time out!

919
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:13,084
Um, are you all right?

920
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:15,484
- Ran! Want a cola?
- Sure!

921
01:08:17,222 --> 01:08:20,392
Yay! Troppy balloons!

922
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:24,351
Urgh! Who made that stupid thing, anyway?!

923
01:08:30,101 --> 01:08:32,228
Here! You must be thirsty!

924
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:36,274
Here's your cola!

925
01:08:36,274 --> 01:08:38,265
T-Thanks!

926
01:08:41,946 --> 01:08:45,550
You're Kudo Shinichi?

927
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:50,681
But... I still can't remember who you are.

928
01:08:56,394 --> 01:08:58,430
Um, Mori-san...

929
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,422
- I need to use the restroom.
- Yeah.

930
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:07,467
Yay! Thank you!

931
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:13,133
The balloons are flying away!

932
01:09:27,826 --> 01:09:29,623
Ran-san! Look out!

933
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:31,963
Stop!

934
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:34,056
Wait, children! Stop!

935
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:38,169
I won't let you escape!

936
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:39,158
Oops!

937
01:09:43,007 --> 01:09:46,238
Eat this! Hot Sauce Squirt Gun!

938
01:09:56,955 --> 01:10:00,191
You're Tomonari Makoto!

939
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,793
What is that?!

940
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:03,261
A knife!

941
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:05,029
That's...

942
01:10:05,029 --> 01:10:09,634
Tomonari Makoto! You're under
arrest for attempted murder!

943
01:10:09,634 --> 01:10:12,303
We did it!

944
01:10:12,303 --> 01:10:18,276
- "The Ran-neechan Protection Squad..."
...is victorious!

945
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,546
M-Mori-san! I'm going to take
him directly to headquarters now!

946
01:10:21,546 --> 01:10:24,014
Wait. I'm coming with you.

947
01:10:25,383 --> 01:10:29,187
- Hurray!
- We did it!

948
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:31,523
There's no need to worry
about being attacked now,

949
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:35,653
and it'll be easier for you to
remember Shinichi without me here.

950
01:10:36,895 --> 01:10:39,898
D-Da...

951
01:10:39,898 --> 01:10:45,131
It's alright. You can call me that
once you remember everything.

952
01:10:47,672 --> 01:10:52,666
Your detective league saved her!
That was excellent work!

953
01:10:55,313 --> 01:10:58,249
He said we did excellent work...

954
01:10:58,249 --> 01:11:02,887
- A great detective...
...praised us!

955
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:05,390
Alright! Now we can
have all the fun we want!

956
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,258
I wanna see the parade!

957
01:11:07,258 --> 01:11:10,061
We can stay until nighttime, right, Doc?!

958
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:15,233
Yes. After all, Shinichi and Ran-kun
stayed until nighttime, too.

959
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:18,236
Hurray!

960
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:21,339
Is it really over now?

961
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:26,333
Hey, Ran! Let's go to the
Devil's Laboratory! It'll be fun!

962
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:41,225
Eh?! You're the famous Mori
Kogoro-san's assistant, little boy?!

963
01:11:41,225 --> 01:11:42,360
Yeah!

964
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,564
If I help you, do you think
I could get Mori-san's autograph?!

965
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:47,932
Oh, me too!

966
01:11:47,932 --> 01:11:49,233
Sure!

967
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:53,404
I can give you as many of that
old guy's autographs as you want!

968
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:55,406
Dr. Jinno, right?

969
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:58,910
I know it's not nice to say this,
but he was a creepy doctor.

970
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:03,214
That's for sure! He was a
tight-wad and had no skill at all!

971
01:12:03,214 --> 01:12:06,217
He caused lots of problems
because of botched surgeries!

972
01:12:06,217 --> 01:12:10,488
Hey, remember that heart attack
patient that got brought in?

973
01:12:10,488 --> 01:12:14,492
Dr. Jinno cut the other surgeon's
hand during that operation!

974
01:12:14,492 --> 01:12:20,498
Yeah! Yeah! And that's the reason
that patient couldn't be saved!

975
01:12:20,498 --> 01:12:22,830
Tell me more about that!

976
01:12:31,342 --> 01:12:34,078
It's just as I thought!

977
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:36,069
I gotta tell the old man right away!

978
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,156
Hello, this is the Mori Detective Agency.

979
01:12:45,156 --> 01:12:49,260
The great Mori Kogoro is
currently busy, solving...

980
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,454
Damn!

981
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:55,033
Kisaki Law Office.

982
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:57,468
- This is Conan!
- Oh, Conan-kun?

983
01:12:57,468 --> 01:12:59,370
Is Kisaki-sensei there?!

984
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,275
Her trial just ended,
and she left for Tropical Land.

985
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:06,611
Tropical Land?

986
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:08,946
Apparently, Ran-san is there, so...

987
01:13:08,946 --> 01:13:10,277
Oh, no!

988
01:13:48,286 --> 01:13:50,254
"Metro Police"

989
01:13:54,025 --> 01:13:57,428
Well? Able to talk now?

990
01:13:57,428 --> 01:14:00,665
I got a phone call from a man.

991
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:03,501
Said he'd tell me the truth
behind my father's death.

992
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:06,871
So I went to the intersection in Beika.

993
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,540
But the man never showed,

994
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,044
and Detective Narasawa was shot nearby!

995
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:17,615
When I returned home,
the man called again.

996
01:14:17,615 --> 01:14:21,919
This time, he said to come to the
Midoridai Maison Park Apartments.

997
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:25,089
But again, he never showed up,

998
01:14:25,089 --> 01:14:30,928
and Detective Shiba was found in the
basement parking lot, shot to death.

999
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:34,728
It was then I realized
I was set up by the killer!

1000
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:40,138
That night, I stayed at a business hotel.

1001
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:43,374
The next day, when
I checked my phone messages,

1002
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:45,643
a woman calling herself Detective Sato

1003
01:14:45,643 --> 01:14:50,148
had left a message telling me to
come to the Beika Sun Plaza Hotel.

1004
01:14:50,148 --> 01:14:53,551
She said she'd arrest me
for murder if I didn't come.

1005
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:58,322
But, when I went,
the place was filled with police.

1006
01:14:58,322 --> 01:15:01,314
So I left, as if escaping.

1007
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:07,398
But then Detective Sato was...

1008
01:15:07,398 --> 01:15:11,302
Why didn't you tell the police right away?

1009
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:15,568
Because I couldn't trust them,
after what happened to my father!

1010
01:15:17,575 --> 01:15:23,514
I decided to ask the great Mori-san
for help, so I hung around him.

1011
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:27,952
Are you saying you didn't
approach Ran-kun at Tropical Land?!

1012
01:15:27,952 --> 01:15:32,123
That's right...
I was going to talk to Mori-san...

1013
01:15:32,123 --> 01:15:34,659
Hold on, now! You had a knife!

1014
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,131
For protection.
The killer might try to kill me...

1015
01:15:40,131 --> 01:15:41,966
W-Whoa, now...

1016
01:15:41,966 --> 01:15:46,137
Then... the killer is someone else?!

1017
01:15:46,137 --> 01:15:49,707
And he has a female conspirator!

1018
01:15:49,707 --> 01:15:52,437
Ran... is in danger!

1019
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:28,504
"Labyrinth of Ice and Fog"

1020
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:33,010
Yeah! This should take me there!

1021
01:16:34,585 --> 01:16:37,054
Um, is the observatory empty?!

1022
01:16:37,054 --> 01:16:40,258
Yeah! Everyone's busy watching the parade!

1023
01:16:40,258 --> 01:16:41,384
Thanks!

1024
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:46,257
Welcome to the Labyrinth of Ice and Fog!

1025
01:16:51,702 --> 01:16:54,262
Ran! Where?! Where are you?!

1026
01:16:59,677 --> 01:17:02,680
Genta and the others?!
I didn't know they came too!

1027
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,616
Which means Ran is nearby!

1028
01:17:05,616 --> 01:17:06,674
That's him!

1029
01:17:07,752 --> 01:17:09,086
Ran!

1030
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:11,589
Oh, yeah! The detective badges!

1031
01:17:11,589 --> 01:17:13,457
Genta! Mitsuhiko! Ayumi!

1032
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:15,960
Hey! Do you read me?! Respond!

1033
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,962
Conan-kun? I read you!

1034
01:17:17,962 --> 01:17:20,698
Guess where we are!

1035
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:23,734
Don't be too shocked, now! Tropical Land!

1036
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:26,804
Hey! Calm down and listen closely!

1037
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:29,240
The killer is there with a gun, to kill Ran!

1038
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,808
Eh?!

1039
01:17:30,808 --> 01:17:35,813
Tell Ran to go through crowded
areas and get out of Tropical Land!

1040
01:17:35,813 --> 01:17:37,906
Hey! Are you listening?!

1041
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:43,220
- Ran-oneesan! Run!
- There's a gun pointed at you!

1042
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,489
Watch out!

1043
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:46,891
Doc!

1044
01:17:46,891 --> 01:17:50,628
People around me are
in danger, because of me...

1045
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:55,733
D-Don't leave, Ran-kun!
The killer wants to get you all alone!

1046
01:17:55,733 --> 01:17:58,736
Ran-kun?! Ran-kun?!

1047
01:17:58,736 --> 01:17:59,930
Damn!

1048
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,843
Ran's on the Island of Dreams
and Fairytales, the next place over!

1049
01:18:05,843 --> 01:18:07,674
The only way to get there is...

1050
01:18:09,747 --> 01:18:11,148
Next group, please!

1051
01:18:11,148 --> 01:18:12,775
H-Hey! Little boy!

1052
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:27,991
There it is!

1053
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:01,966
Conan-kun!

1054
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:04,368
You're safe now, Ran-neechan!

1055
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:06,632
Let's blend in with the crowd
and get out of here!

1056
01:19:08,472 --> 01:19:09,404
This way!

1057
01:19:11,675 --> 01:19:12,643
Dammit!

1058
01:19:12,643 --> 01:19:15,908
So it doesn't matter what happens
to anyone, as long as Ran dies?!

1059
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:26,090
Help! There's a crazy person!

1060
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,990
- Jump into the boat!
- Eh?!

1061
01:19:30,995 --> 01:19:32,485
Hey, you!

1062
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:46,677
Conan-kun! Where did
you learn to drive a boat?!

1063
01:19:46,677 --> 01:19:48,879
My old man taught me in Hawaii!

1064
01:19:48,879 --> 01:19:50,005
Eh?

1065
01:19:54,251 --> 01:19:57,455
Hey! We're safe now, wouldn't you say?

1066
01:19:57,455 --> 01:19:58,683
No!

1067
01:20:11,802 --> 01:20:13,064
My cola!

1068
01:20:14,805 --> 01:20:15,863
Cola?!

1069
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:27,277
20 minutes to 9:00!

1070
01:20:34,725 --> 01:20:36,627
Conan-kun! Waterfall!

1071
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:38,060
Hold on!

1072
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:00,176
Let's hurry!

1073
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:13,164
Just a little more! Hang in there!

1074
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:14,791
Y-Yeah...

1075
01:21:15,933 --> 01:21:18,936
Damn! He already caught up!

1076
01:21:18,936 --> 01:21:22,997
Climb up and hide behind the rocks! Hurry!

1077
01:21:35,786 --> 01:21:38,055
C-Conan-kun?!

1078
01:21:38,055 --> 01:21:44,187
No one's here; this place is closed
at night. You can show yourself.

1079
01:21:45,963 --> 01:21:48,799
You're quite cautious.

1080
01:21:48,799 --> 01:21:51,368
But there's no point in hiding...

1081
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:56,340
...because I figured out what Detective
Narasawa's message really meant.

1082
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:01,078
He didn't grab the left side of his
chest to indicate the police notebook!

1083
01:22:01,078 --> 01:22:02,636
He was indicating his heart!

1084
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:09,019
One of the letters in the Japanese
word for "psychiatry" is heart!

1085
01:22:09,019 --> 01:22:12,978
Isn't that right, Dr. Kazato Kyosuke?

1086
01:22:24,168 --> 01:22:26,503
When did you figure out it was me?

1087
01:22:26,503 --> 01:22:32,209
The first time I thought, "Oh?"
Was when I remembered the phone.

1088
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:36,880
First, right-handed people
don't dial with their left hand.

1089
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,351
Yes. You were left-handed.

1090
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:43,120
I see. That was careless of me.

1091
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:51,028
7 years ago, you were the best young
surgeon at Toto University Hospital.

1092
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:55,766
But one day, during an operation
handled by you and Jinno-san,

1093
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:59,964
he accidentally cut your
left wrist with a scalpel.

1094
01:23:03,641 --> 01:23:09,713
Because of that accident, your
so-called "Golden Hand" was ruined.

1095
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:12,816
Because of your pride,
you abandoned the scalpel

1096
01:23:12,816 --> 01:23:16,587
and switched from surgery to psychiatry.

1097
01:23:16,587 --> 01:23:22,593
Ever since, perhaps out of pride,
you lived as a right-handed person.

1098
01:23:22,593 --> 01:23:24,094
Exactly.

1099
01:23:24,094 --> 01:23:28,399
Never imagined just dialing
a phone would get me found out.

1100
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:32,670
You transferred to Beika Yakushino
Hospital as a psychiatrist,

1101
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:36,073
and something happened between
you and Jinno-san one year ago.

1102
01:23:36,073 --> 01:23:40,444
I ran into him again, just by coincidence!

1103
01:23:40,444 --> 01:23:43,814
He invited me over for
a drink at his apartment.

1104
01:23:43,814 --> 01:23:48,852
Drunk, I unleashed the suspicion
I had held in my heart for six years.

1105
01:23:48,852 --> 01:23:51,286
I asked if that accident
had been on purpose.

1106
01:23:55,292 --> 01:23:58,352
You're such a pushover.

1107
01:24:00,164 --> 01:24:02,866
It had been on purpose after all!

1108
01:24:02,866 --> 01:24:07,104
That's when the bloodlust arose!

1109
01:24:07,104 --> 01:24:10,441
He was being sued for
a botched operation at the time,

1110
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:13,604
so he had plenty of reason to kill himself.

1111
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:22,319
As expected, the investigation
deemed it a suicide.

1112
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:27,224
But you knew the case
was going to be re-opened.

1113
01:24:27,224 --> 01:24:30,694
Yes, I heard from Detective Narasawa,
who transferred to the Beika Police.

1114
01:24:30,694 --> 01:24:35,499
The death of his partner, Detective
Tomonari, was a shock for him,

1115
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:37,901
so he came to me for counseling.

1116
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:42,239
I also learned from him that
Tomonari Makoto blamed the police!

1117
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:47,144
So, before the re-opening of the
case brought the police to you,

1118
01:24:47,144 --> 01:24:51,648
you shot the three detectives
and lured Tomonari Makoto-san

1119
01:24:51,648 --> 01:24:53,250
to the scenes to pin the blame on him?

1120
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:59,356
That's right. For Detective Narasawa
and Detective Shiba, I called him myself.

1121
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:01,358
For Detective Sato...

1122
01:25:01,358 --> 01:25:07,264
...you edited a tape you recorded
of a female patient. Right?

1123
01:25:07,264 --> 01:25:09,266
Precisely.

1124
01:25:09,266 --> 01:25:13,404
You heard that Detective Narasawa
died holding his notebook

1125
01:25:13,404 --> 01:25:15,706
from Inspector Shiratori, didn't you?

1126
01:25:15,706 --> 01:25:18,609
I am his doctor, after all.

1127
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:24,081
And then, to suggest it was the
detective's son, Narasawa Makoto,

1128
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:28,585
you purposely put the police
notebook in Detective Shiba's hand!

1129
01:25:28,585 --> 01:25:34,425
Impressive work, Conan-kun!
But there's no proof that I did it.

1130
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:40,464
When Detective Sato was shot, no
gunpowder traces were found on me.

1131
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:44,568
If you'd like, I can
explain that trick for you!

1132
01:25:44,568 --> 01:25:45,769
What?!

1133
01:25:45,769 --> 01:25:48,795
After the police arrest you, that is.

1134
01:26:05,222 --> 01:26:06,857
- This way!
- Eh?!

1135
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:07,224
"Authorized Personnel Only"
- This way!
- Eh?!

1136
01:26:07,224 --> 01:26:09,359
"Authorized Personnel Only"
He'll be waiting for us at that exit!

1137
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:09,723
He'll be waiting for us at that exit!

1138
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:32,749
Where is this?

1139
01:26:32,749 --> 01:26:35,819
The main isle of the Island
of Adventure and Frontier!

1140
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:38,355
We passed under the ocean
from that small island!

1141
01:26:38,355 --> 01:26:40,090
Really?

1142
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:41,250
Let's go!

1143
01:26:47,097 --> 01:26:49,266
We still haven't finished our discussion!

1144
01:26:49,266 --> 01:26:52,436
Damn! He followed us in a boat!

1145
01:26:52,436 --> 01:26:56,773
I can't have you revealing that trick, now.

1146
01:26:56,773 --> 01:27:02,279
It'd make me one of the possible
people who shot Detective Sato.

1147
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:04,815
Even if Ran gives her eyewitness testimony,

1148
01:27:04,815 --> 01:27:08,218
you can still play innocent due to
the lack of gunpowder traces, huh?

1149
01:27:08,218 --> 01:27:12,990
That's right. Because Ran-kun
only saw me for a second.

1150
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:16,326
But I'd rather nip these
dangerous buds early on!

1151
01:27:16,326 --> 01:27:20,631
So let's hear if your theory is right or not.

1152
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,299
My pleasure!

1153
01:27:22,299 --> 01:27:27,838
First, after you blacked
out the hotel's 15th floor,

1154
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:30,340
you put on surgical gloves

1155
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:35,913
and took an umbrella you prepared
in advance to the ladies' room.

1156
01:27:35,913 --> 01:27:40,050
You made a hole near the tip
of the umbrella ahead of time.

1157
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:43,315
You stuck your gun through that hole and fired.

1158
01:27:47,224 --> 01:27:52,821
In short, the umbrella protected
you from the gunpowder and smoke.

1159
01:27:54,097 --> 01:27:58,769
That's why you didn't test
positive for traces of gunpowder!

1160
01:27:58,769 --> 01:28:02,940
I assume you flushed the gloves
down one of the men's toilets?

1161
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,276
Correct, Conan-kun!

1162
01:28:06,276 --> 01:28:09,746
It seems you will have to die.

1163
01:28:09,746 --> 01:28:12,340
C-Conan-kun...

1164
01:28:28,532 --> 01:28:31,702
- Tell me! Why?!
- Eh?!

1165
01:28:31,702 --> 01:28:36,537
Why are you going so far to protect me?

1166
01:28:37,908 --> 01:28:40,240
Tell me... Why?

1167
01:28:44,214 --> 01:28:46,783
- Because I love you!
- Eh?!

1168
01:28:46,783 --> 01:28:52,155
Because I love you! More than anyone...

1169
01:28:52,155 --> 01:28:53,588
...on this Earth!

1170
01:28:55,158 --> 01:28:56,216
Jump!

1171
01:28:57,728 --> 01:28:59,563
- Take a deep breath!
- Eh?!

1172
01:28:59,563 --> 01:29:00,928
Hurry!

1173
01:29:11,842 --> 01:29:13,275
Thanks!

1174
01:29:14,411 --> 01:29:16,242
Mr. Grownup!

1175
01:29:17,314 --> 01:29:18,582
Yeah.

1176
01:29:18,582 --> 01:29:19,981
Damn it!

1177
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:39,836
46 seconds!

1178
01:29:39,836 --> 01:29:41,030
He's here!

1179
01:29:43,974 --> 01:29:47,511
What do you say we end it here, Conan-kun?

1180
01:29:47,511 --> 01:29:51,675
Besides, you have no place left to run...

1181
01:29:58,455 --> 01:30:00,490
C-Conan-kun!

1182
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:03,894
L-I'm fine! It only grazed my arm!

1183
01:30:03,894 --> 01:30:07,386
I just told you. There's no place left to run!

1184
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:15,372
If you kill Ran now, won't Tomonari
Makoto-san be proven innocent?

1185
01:30:15,372 --> 01:30:20,377
That's right. I planned to eliminate
Tomonari before he got arrested...

1186
01:30:20,377 --> 01:30:22,079
...but that can't be helped now.

1187
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:27,050
Now, then. I guess this
should be "ladies first"?

1188
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,486
Ten. Nine.

1189
01:30:29,486 --> 01:30:30,687
Eight.

1190
01:30:30,687 --> 01:30:31,688
Seven.

1191
01:30:31,688 --> 01:30:33,056
Six.

1192
01:30:33,056 --> 01:30:35,425
- Five.
- Some kind of magic charm?

1193
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:36,493
Three!

1194
01:30:36,493 --> 01:30:37,828
Two!

1195
01:30:37,828 --> 01:30:38,817
One!

1196
01:30:46,436 --> 01:30:49,106
No, Ran-san!

1197
01:30:49,106 --> 01:30:50,505
Detective Sato!

1198
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,082
Here! You must be thirsty!

1199
01:30:59,082 --> 01:31:00,071
One!

1200
01:31:16,566 --> 01:31:18,568
Distance yourself from me!

1201
01:31:18,568 --> 01:31:22,732
You're through once the
fountains stop! Give it up!

1202
01:31:32,749 --> 01:31:35,218
A childish trick!

1203
01:31:35,218 --> 01:31:36,617
There you are!

1204
01:31:42,759 --> 01:31:45,228
Die!

1205
01:31:45,228 --> 01:31:46,627
Take this!

1206
01:31:53,036 --> 01:32:02,679
I sadly watched the rain
pound on you as you bent over

1207
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:04,681
I sadly watched the rain
pound on you as you bent over
Conan-kun...

1208
01:32:04,681 --> 01:32:06,683
I sadly watched the rain
pound on you as you bent over
Ran! Could it be?!

1209
01:32:06,683 --> 01:32:07,784
I sadly watched the rain
pound on you as you bent over

1210
01:32:07,784 --> 01:32:09,853
If there was only one umbrella
in this world, I'd find it for you

1211
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:13,523
If there was only one umbrella
in this world, I'd find it for you
Damn it! I'll take care of you first!

1212
01:32:13,523 --> 01:32:19,129
If there was only one umbrella
in this world, I'd find it for you

1213
01:32:19,129 --> 01:32:21,998
If there was only one umbrella
in this world, I'd find it for you
No... way...

1214
01:32:21,998 --> 01:32:22,499
If there was only one umbrella
in this world, I'd find it for you
I remember everything now!

1215
01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:24,134
I can't do anything but I can't
get drenched in your place, either
I remember everything now!

1216
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:26,536
I can't do anything but I can't
get drenched in your place, either
I remember that you shot Detective Sato,

1217
01:32:26,536 --> 01:32:29,539
I can't do anything but I can't
get drenched in your place, either
and that I was champion of
the city karate tournament!

1218
01:32:29,539 --> 01:32:32,209
I can't do anything but I can't
get drenched in your place, either
Karate... champion?!

1219
01:32:32,209 --> 01:32:36,813
I can't do anything but I can't
get drenched in your place, either

1220
01:32:36,813 --> 01:32:47,524
I beg of you, please confess your worries to me

1221
01:32:47,524 --> 01:32:48,825
I beg of you, please confess your worries to me
W-Wow!

1222
01:32:58,802 --> 01:33:01,538
- Ran!
- Ran!

1223
01:33:01,538 --> 01:33:03,740
Mom! Dad!

1224
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,742
Y-You...

1225
01:33:05,742 --> 01:33:07,878
Your memory's back?!

1226
01:33:07,878 --> 01:33:10,046
Do you remember me too, then?!

1227
01:33:10,046 --> 01:33:16,720
Of course, Suzuki Sonoko, my friend for life!

1228
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,347
Ran...

1229
01:33:21,558 --> 01:33:25,517
Ran! Thank goodness!

1230
01:33:27,764 --> 01:33:31,735
So he was the killer after all?

1231
01:33:31,735 --> 01:33:37,040
Superintendent Odagiri re-opened
the case himself, and filled us in.

1232
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,577
That's no fair, Conan!
Catching him yourself!

1233
01:33:40,577 --> 01:33:44,881
Don't be silly! Conan-kun wanted
to keep you out of harm's way!

1234
01:33:44,881 --> 01:33:50,854
- That's exactly it!
- We're in the same detective league!

1235
01:33:50,854 --> 01:33:52,622
Sorry, sorry!

1236
01:33:52,622 --> 01:33:55,125
Huh? You're bleeding, Conan-kun...

1237
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,294
- Eh?
- Here.

1238
01:33:57,294 --> 01:33:58,862
Thanks.

1239
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:02,127
Things are well, for now.

1240
01:34:03,733 --> 01:34:05,769
Yeah...

1241
01:34:05,769 --> 01:34:08,772
Well done, Mr. Great Detective!

1242
01:34:08,772 --> 01:34:11,541
Tamaki-san! What are you doing here?!

1243
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:14,978
I came to keep an eye on Toshiya.
He played here today.

1244
01:34:14,978 --> 01:34:17,314
Turned out to be pointless, though!

1245
01:34:17,314 --> 01:34:22,619
Still, what was that about putting
your life on the line to protect Ran?

1246
01:34:22,619 --> 01:34:26,723
It was Conan-kun and Dr. Agasa
who risked their lives for her!

1247
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:28,925
N-No, uhh...

1248
01:34:28,925 --> 01:34:31,723
In any case, what a relief that she's alright!

1249
01:34:33,763 --> 01:34:36,099
- Seriously?!
- Yes!

1250
01:34:36,099 --> 01:34:39,736
Everyone! Sato-san is conscious again!

1251
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:41,671
There's no need to worry anymore!

1252
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:43,662
Oh! Really?!

1253
01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:52,015
Sato-san!

1254
01:34:52,015 --> 01:34:53,850
This is wonderful, Takagi-san!

1255
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:55,752
That's great!

1256
01:34:55,752 --> 01:34:57,854
That wraps everything up!

1257
01:34:57,854 --> 01:34:59,923
Don't be stupid!

1258
01:34:59,923 --> 01:35:03,293
There's still Toshiya's extortion case!

1259
01:35:03,293 --> 01:35:05,862
His victim is dead now,

1260
01:35:05,862 --> 01:35:09,132
but give him a good
wringing and get all the facts!

1261
01:35:09,132 --> 01:35:10,793
Understood, sir!

1262
01:35:13,269 --> 01:35:18,108
It would seem you were
the first to uncover the truth.

1263
01:35:18,108 --> 01:35:20,143
Just who are you?

1264
01:35:20,143 --> 01:35:22,373
Need not to know.

1265
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:26,416
I'm just a regular grade-schooler!

1266
01:35:51,007 --> 01:36:01,117
If there was no impurity in this world,

1267
01:36:01,117 --> 01:36:12,095
we could've loved each other
without changing form

1268
01:36:12,095 --> 01:36:22,639
Why does time divide people?

1269
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:32,115
Please, stay by my side, just for now

1270
01:36:32,115 --> 01:36:42,826
I grow stronger because I have you

1271
01:36:42,826 --> 01:36:54,237
The vowed ring is so sparkly and pretty

1272
01:36:54,237 --> 01:37:06,816
You will realize little dreams too

1273
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:13,984
You are the one, my heart is filled

1274
01:37:26,269 --> 01:37:36,946
I grow stronger because I have you

1275
01:37:36,946 --> 01:37:48,224
The vowed ring is so sparkly and pretty

1276
01:37:48,224 --> 01:38:00,904
You will realize little dreams too

1277
01:38:00,904 --> 01:38:09,141
You are the one,
someday they will come true

1278
01:38:21,124 --> 01:38:22,959
Thanks, Conan-kun!

1279
01:38:22,959 --> 01:38:27,363
You said those things earlier to
help me get my memory back, right?

1280
01:38:27,363 --> 01:38:28,898
Eh?

1281
01:38:28,898 --> 01:38:35,171
You heard it at the hotel, right?
How my dad proposed to my mom!

1282
01:38:35,171 --> 01:38:41,144
"I love you. More than anyone on this Earth."

1283
01:38:41,144 --> 01:38:43,913
So you said the same thing on purpose!

1284
01:38:43,913 --> 01:38:47,383
- The old guy said that?!
- Huh? It wasn't on purpose?

1285
01:38:47,383 --> 01:38:50,420
N-No, uhh, it was.

1286
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:52,522
I thought so!

1287
01:38:52,522 --> 01:38:57,360
After all, the two of us have
too much of an age difference!

1288
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,352
But it made me happy! Good night!

1289
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:04,199
Good night...

1290
01:39:08,037 --> 01:39:10,028
Ah, well.

1291
01:39:11,274 --> 01:39:14,444
Wait a minute! That means...

1292
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:18,715
...I thought up the same thing he did?!

1293
01:39:18,715 --> 01:39:20,114
Ugh...
