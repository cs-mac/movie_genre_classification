1
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:11,072
In black and white

2
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,870
Widescreen 1:1.66

3
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:24,210
And production sound

4
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:30,925
Shot in 11 weeks,
between July 1 and October 31, 1975,

5
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,096
between Lüneburg and Hof,
along the border with East Germany.

6
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,574
Last time you told me
you were a cinema musician?

7
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,785
I was.

8
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:58,995
Well...

9
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:03,249
my wife played the piano,
you know?

10
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,586
With me on the violin,
you know?

11
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,088
And if it was a big film,

12
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:14,093
<i>like The Nibelungs or Ben-Hur,
then there was other music.</i>

13
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:19,641
We added a cello, a double bass,
and a harmonium, you know?

14
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,727
Maybe drums and cymbals too.

15
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,649
It wasn't easy to play, you know?
- And they all lost their jobs?

16
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,486
Those were tough days,
when talkies came in.

17
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:35,615
I mean the real talkies.
At first it was on records, you know?

18
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,743
There were these big records.

19
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:44,999
Each of these films
had maybe 12, 14 small reels.

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,585
Of course it often happened

21
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,879
when a film broke

22
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,133
that the stuff didn't fit together,
so we had to spend nights on end

23
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:56,761
slicing it together, you know?

24
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,847
And still it was lousy.

25
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:02,267
And they booed us the next day.
That's how it was.

26
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,644
What was your biggest score?

27
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,438
<i>I'd say The Nibelungs.</i>

28
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,525
<i>The film The Nibelungs
was in two parts.</i>

29
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,030
<i>The first was Siegfried's Death,
the second Kriemhild's Revenge.</i>

30
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,534
<i>Ben-Hur was
in two parts too, you know?</i>

31
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,036
I think so.

32
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:25,665
I'm not sure though.
But I do know

33
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,751
<i>that The Nibelungs
was in two parts.</i>

34
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:32,130
If you had to live
from your theater alone, could you?

35
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,633
Impossible. Not nowadays.

36
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:41,890
Just imagine: In a few years there'll be
no theaters left in small towns.

37
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,896
I think where one theater
can survive -

38
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,690
For instance,
in places like around here,

39
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:54,611
like in Schirnding, Hohenberg,
Heckstädt, Thiersheim...

40
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:58,781
there used to be theaters everywhere,
in all these small market towns.

41
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,201
Today they're all gone.

42
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:07,123
But if there's just one left,
I'd say it'll still be going in 10 years.

43
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,208
If they're still making films.

44
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,004
I mean, if films
were still being made.

45
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:19,052
Could you make a living
off your theater at one time?

46
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,722
Yes. From 1951, you know?

47
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,477
I wasn't allowed to run one
for years, you know?

48
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,272
Because of the Third Reich
and so on.

49
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,733
Why weren't you allowed to?

50
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,945
Because I was a Party member.

51
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,322
SPD, you know?

52
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:44,035
I mean NSPDAD, or whatever
its name was, you know?

53
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:52,001
I had to sue from 1950-1951
to get my theater back, you know?

54
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,421
That happened
to lots of theater owners.

55
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,146
KINGS OF THE ROAD

56
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,862
How can you dream such crap?

57
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,991
They squeak, eh?

58
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,188
Take off your wet clothes.
I'll give you some of mine.

59
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,106
I need water for my truck.

60
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:22,764
Sleeping the day away!

61
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,301
Can I have this?

62
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,744
TERROR ATTACK IN JERUSALEM

63
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,056
PICTURE PALACE

64
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,680
I have to pee.

65
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,708
Your clothes are dry now.

66
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,381
What's the next big town?

67
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:39,636
I'm passing through Wolfsburg.

68
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,410
I'm Bruno Winter.

69
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,162
I'm Lander.

70
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,206
Sorry?

71
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,917
Robert Lander.

72
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,974
Thanks.

73
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,809
You're welcome.

74
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:37,545
How long have you done this
with the truck and the theaters?

75
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,589
Two years.

76
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,758
Alone?

77
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,052
Two years?

78
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:48,139
And where do you live?
Where's your home base?

79
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,851
The truck's registered in Munich.
That's where I bought it.

80
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,149
How do you cope...

81
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,693
with being alone?

82
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,780
I get by.

83
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,450
Better and better.

84
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:11,329
I can't.

85
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:34,894
Got any idea
where you might be heading?

86
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,816
Let's see.

87
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,536
This one goes to Lehrte.

88
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,080
Magdeburg, Dessau...

89
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,761
Braunschweig...

90
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,933
Helmstedt...
- I'll be in Helmstedt this afternoon.

91
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,688
At the Roxy.

92
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,733
Finished already?

93
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,361
Yes.

94
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,951
What day is it today?

95
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,453
Monday.

96
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:07,171
I just had a beer.

97
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,434
Yesterday I was still in Genoa.

98
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:03,519
That's why!

99
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,846
I'm tired. I'm not going on.

100
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,351
I can fix up another bed.

101
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,438
I'm going for a walk.

102
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,483
Down to the railway.

103
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,271
Do you know...

104
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:55,441
what a "loon" is?

105
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,120
That doesn't make sense.

106
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,125
How does the whole sentence go?

107
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:29,725
A waterbird.

108
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,978
A diver.

109
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:51,455
Morning.

110
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,754
Let's get going.

111
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,173
Like some music?

112
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,099
He's gone.

113
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,686
Kamikaze's gone.

114
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:20,067
Our daredevil friend,
the hell driver.

115
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,617
Oh, sorry.

116
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,746
I've got something for breakfast.

117
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,373
Fine.

118
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,584
The cup's fucked.

119
00:40:21,712 --> 00:40:23,798
Do I get a new one?

120
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:32,098
Where is it?

121
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,646
Still okay.

122
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,274
It'll fall off again!

123
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:08,634
<i>Come on in, children!</i>

124
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,478
When can we get started?

125
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,233
The children are all worked up.

126
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,780
I didn't think
I'd have to repair a speaker.

127
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:31,949
Good thing I had a spare.

128
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,326
We've been waiting half an hour.

129
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,745
The children
can't wait much longer.

130
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,958
We'll install this.
Then we're all set.

131
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,345
Now be quiet!

132
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,641
The men have
to do some repairs.

133
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,685
We'll start in five minutes.

134
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,854
They're taking a long time!

135
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,858
Quiet now,
or we'll all go back to school.

136
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:18,037
Can't see a thing!

137
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:29,215
You want to see the film with sound,
so they have to repair the speaker.

138
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:32,885
Be quiet!

139
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:35,346
Vacation starts tomorrow.

140
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:38,390
Then you can do
whatever you like.

141
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,734
Turn out the light!

142
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:59,216
The next turnoff leads
to the village of "Powerless."

143
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,262
Only one road leads there,

144
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,764
a dead end.

145
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:10,269
About four miles
there and back.

146
00:46:11,061 --> 00:46:14,523
Not worth it.
Just like any other village.

147
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,446
- Ever been there?
- Last time I noticed it on the map...

148
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,284
so off I went to "Powerless."

149
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:32,541
The village on the other side
of the hill is called "Peaceless."

150
00:46:34,543 --> 00:46:37,296
And the hill's called...

151
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:40,799
"Dead Man."

152
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:48,807
"Powerless," "Peaceless,"

153
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:51,059
"Dead Man"...

154
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,816
I don't believe it!

155
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,860
I bought a few things.

156
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:46,782
I couldn't find a shirt.

157
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:49,368
They only have high collars here.

158
00:47:50,827 --> 00:47:53,705
They chafe my neck.

159
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,505
It's terribly sticky.

160
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,091
A hot wind.

161
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,641
I feel like going for a swim.

162
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,560
Later.

163
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:16,728
In a quarry pond.

164
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:20,816
I don't have time.

165
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,078
I can always go on alone.

166
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:07,005
A nine-digit number.

167
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,966
A matter of life and death.

168
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:58,432
- What was the town where...?
- Schöningen.

169
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:04,396
Standing there on the ladder...

170
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,191
I suddenly freaked out.

171
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:12,237
I was watching my own shadow,

172
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:16,908
and in that moment
I noticed you watching me.

173
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,663
That was it.
I wanted to stop right there.

174
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:27,461
I was in a rage.

175
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:29,921
And helpless.

176
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:33,759
Why did I get involved in this?

177
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:36,470
But you went on acting the fool,

178
00:51:36,595 --> 00:51:39,765
so all I could do
was join you again.

179
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,768
That made me even angrier.

180
00:51:44,478 --> 00:51:46,563
Same thing with me.

181
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:48,565
What?

182
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,235
Cut it out!

183
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:19,763
I'm not sleeping
in the cabin again.

184
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,474
Sleep wherever you like.

185
00:52:47,457 --> 00:52:50,085
- How was the sausage?
- Good.

186
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:07,561
Do you do anything else
except "test-driving"?

187
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,815
I'm a pediatrician.
- What?

188
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,735
A sort of children's doctor.

189
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,245
In Genoa I separated from my wife.

190
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:29,457
I didn't ask you about that.

191
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:33,295
There's no need
to tell me your stories.

192
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:36,047
So what would you like to hear?

193
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,884
Who you are.

194
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:41,720
I am my story.

195
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,834
The mattress is in the back.

196
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,128
It's not locked.

197
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,635
Take a cushion.

198
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:55,385
What a noise!

199
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,512
Beat it!

200
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:04,769
What's wrong?

201
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:18,408
Can I help you?

202
01:00:18,533 --> 01:00:20,410
Leave me alone!

203
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,328
I'm not hurt.

204
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,172
This isn't my blood.

205
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,928
I wasn't even in the car.

206
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,600
It's my wife's coat!

207
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,777
There was some word...

208
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,115
a remark.

209
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:08,619
Yesterday.

210
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,086
It started something.

211
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:23,968
And then she drove into a tree.

212
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:40,026
We...

213
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,616
We spent a few days...

214
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,952
in a village inn.

215
01:03:52,371 --> 01:03:54,415
There were these beds,

216
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,334
twin beds,

217
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:00,254
and the kitchen beneath...

218
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,382
When you opened the window -

219
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:11,474
And then she said, "I'm fed up!

220
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,810
Fed up with the bed,
the washbasin, the kitchen,

221
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:17,271
the lamp, the painting..."

222
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:24,028
Suddenly
the smell from the kitchen -

223
01:04:26,072 --> 01:04:28,157
She'd had enough.

224
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,036
Go back!

225
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,003
She even told me
she'd drive into a tree.

226
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:43,381
She told me so!

227
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:48,094
That's a kind of blackmail.

228
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,890
I told the police...

229
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,981
that she told me
she would drive into -

230
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:05,486
They couldn't care less.

231
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:10,074
They...

232
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:12,493
completely -

233
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,329
An accident!

234
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,126
She was still warm.

235
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,758
She's dead.

236
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,486
I wonder if she knew that.

237
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:03,544
Life is all there is!

238
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,093
Death doesn't really exist.

239
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,798
Kamikaze...

240
01:08:54,757 --> 01:08:56,926
have you got a tenant?

241
01:08:57,802 --> 01:08:59,303
Sure.

242
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,899
There was some ink...

243
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:16,320
that you could erase
old writing with...

244
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:20,825
and write something new
at the same time.

245
01:09:26,622 --> 01:09:30,835
I kept thinking
and writing down the same thing.

246
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:36,006
Even when I kept waking up
from this dream.

247
01:09:38,926 --> 01:09:41,095
Abstract repetitions...

248
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:44,765
processes, paths...

249
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,979
that I experienced
and wrote down simultaneously.

250
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:52,189
That means...

251
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,733
dreaming was a form of writing

252
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:57,027
in circles.

253
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:01,699
Until I dreamt up the idea

254
01:10:02,283 --> 01:10:04,869
of using another ink.

255
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,372
With this new ink...

256
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:13,168
there were suddenly
new things I could think...

257
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:15,421
and see...

258
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,548
and write.

259
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,846
Everything was solved.

260
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:29,226
No.

261
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:34,565
You're still in a fix!

262
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,084
Is the car still there?

263
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:02,051
Yes, it's still by the tree.

264
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:09,016
- Can I stay here?
- What?

265
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:11,101
In the truck,
till they tow her car.

266
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:15,439
No, we have to move on.

267
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:21,111
I've arranged it all.
They tow it away this morning.

268
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:25,449
Can't do it.

269
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,953
I couldn't stand
seeing the car again!

270
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,790
You don't have to pass it.

271
01:11:34,667 --> 01:11:36,794
We've got to move on.

272
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:53,978
We don't.

273
01:11:57,272 --> 01:11:58,857
I don't.

274
01:12:22,006 --> 01:12:24,550
What did I tell you yesterday?

275
01:12:27,011 --> 01:12:29,096
You weren't feeling well.

276
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:31,598
Because of the accident.

277
01:14:57,828 --> 01:14:59,580
That'll do!

278
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,932
They're towing away the car.

279
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:21,310
Tell me when it's gone.

280
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,066
It's being lifted up
at the front now.

281
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,865
A tow truck with a crane.

282
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,786
The car's being pulled
up the bank.

283
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:46,668
Now it's on the road.
They're leaving. No -

284
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:48,670
They're turning.

285
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:54,259
Now they're leaving.

286
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:02,684
And now I can
no longer see them.

287
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,520
MORE THAN ONE MILLION
UNEMPLOYED

288
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:54,374
"I'm going to my father's place
in Ostheim.

289
01:19:54,499 --> 01:19:57,294
I know your route. R."

290
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:20,283
Father.

291
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:27,540
Robert!

292
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,752
Just listen.

293
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:40,678
Still doing everything
on your own?

294
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:46,810
Does your paper
still come out every day?

295
01:25:46,935 --> 01:25:48,520
No...

296
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:51,189
only three times a week.

297
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:56,319
You haven't had any repairs
done to the house?

298
01:25:57,529 --> 01:25:59,155
You know...

299
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:05,912
this whole time
I've been away...

300
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,623
these past 10 years...

301
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,001
each time

302
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:17,006
I thought or talked
about something,

303
01:26:17,507 --> 01:26:22,887
I always kept imagining
to see it in print right away.

304
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,432
That you immediately printed it.

305
01:26:26,558 --> 01:26:28,935
- I know that myself.
- Be quiet!

306
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:38,194
Listen, once and for all!

307
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:50,290
If you start talking, I'll leave.

308
01:26:59,424 --> 01:27:02,135
Last time I tried to talk to you,

309
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:05,346
I had to listen all the time.

310
01:27:06,556 --> 01:27:11,060
I stood next to your desk,
all embarrassed...

311
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:14,856
because I didn't want to admit...

312
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:19,319
that you're a gabber...

313
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:23,197
that I think you're gabby.

314
01:27:28,453 --> 01:27:31,247
Mother never had her say either.

315
01:27:32,874 --> 01:27:35,585
That's what I wanted
to talk about:

316
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:56,022
that she didn't get anywhere

317
01:27:56,606 --> 01:27:58,524
in her life with you.

318
01:28:05,323 --> 01:28:06,991
Shut up!

319
01:28:16,209 --> 01:28:17,794
Why...

320
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,382
didn't you...

321
01:28:24,926 --> 01:28:27,136
let her...

322
01:28:50,034 --> 01:28:51,786
Have you got a light?

323
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,132
I just won it.

324
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:10,555
Aren't you cold?

325
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,517
The sun was shining just now.

326
01:29:16,894 --> 01:29:18,938
A Führer fire!

327
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:23,151
Is it too early
to go on the ride?

328
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:25,695
The ticket booth is still closed.

329
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,865
Couldn't I pay you?

330
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:42,795
- Don't you have anything smaller?
- No.

331
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,714
Hold the old fellow.

332
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:50,887
You could ride forever on that!

333
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:13,951
Is she with you?

334
01:30:44,524 --> 01:30:46,526
How about an ice cream?

335
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:53,533
What if I get changed?

336
01:30:56,953 --> 01:30:58,121
This evening?

337
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,291
I'll be at the movies tonight.

338
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:05,795
Here? I'll be coming!

339
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:20,309
This is my automatic press.

340
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:25,273
I bought it three years ago.
- I couldn't care less.

341
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:31,571
I want to talk to you
about my mother.

342
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,740
I know that!

343
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:37,952
But you haven't said
a word in two hours.

344
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:43,749
Listen to me anyway.

345
01:31:56,053 --> 01:31:57,722
I want you

346
01:31:57,847 --> 01:31:59,932
to listen to me!

347
01:33:03,079 --> 01:33:05,039
Has the feature started yet?

348
01:33:09,085 --> 01:33:13,005
Ten minutes ago.
But you haven't missed anything.

349
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,592
You tricked me.

350
01:33:16,717 --> 01:33:18,636
I don't know...

351
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:22,598
But you got all dressed up!

352
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:25,226
Waste of time.

353
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,979
Or do we go
to the movies after all?

354
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:29,981
Best seats?

355
01:33:30,106 --> 01:33:32,316
Yes. Two.

356
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:35,778
Eight marks.

357
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:42,868
Don't you have anything smaller?

358
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:53,587
At least give me some almonds.

359
01:33:59,844 --> 01:34:01,595
You owe me two marks.

360
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:05,933
No, I'll treat you
to an ice after the show.

361
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:09,145
Okay?

362
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:14,191
Time to go in,

363
01:34:14,317 --> 01:34:16,319
or your tickets will expire.

364
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:45,890
Your wife... I never met her.

365
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:48,517
We don't live together anymore.

366
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:06,118
I'm one up on you:

367
01:35:07,495 --> 01:35:10,206
I separated from my wife.

368
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:37,233
- Want some coffee too?
- No, thanks.

369
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,026
Oh, of course.

370
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:26,407
<i>- Just relax, my boy!
- No.</i>

371
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,951
<i>You're bursting with juices, right?</i>

372
01:36:30,119 --> 01:36:33,414
<i>But don't lose control now!</i>

373
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:35,416
<i>Yes...</i>

374
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,002
<i>But Linda, I'm no rogue.</i>

375
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:41,922
<i>Yuri, I think you're crazy, but...</i>

376
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:02,485
Don't you like the film?

377
01:37:02,902 --> 01:37:04,820
Words fail me.

378
01:37:06,572 --> 01:37:10,951
Besides, it's out of focus
and too dark in the middle.

379
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,120
And it's badly framed.

380
01:37:13,245 --> 01:37:15,498
I'm afraid that's Greek to me.

381
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,002
Haven't been here long?

382
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:22,505
Just helping out my grandma.

383
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:26,425
Honestly!

384
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:32,681
You could call the projectionist.

385
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:41,815
He's just helping out too.

386
01:37:42,733 --> 01:37:44,527
What do I say?

387
01:37:55,538 --> 01:37:57,373
I'll see to it.

388
01:37:57,873 --> 01:38:01,001
<i>- Mother, I have a question.
- Yes, son?</i>

389
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:05,214
<i>- When is fruit ripe?
- When it falls into your lap.</i>

390
01:38:56,932 --> 01:38:58,934
The picture's out of focus.

391
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:00,436
Says who?

392
01:39:00,894 --> 01:39:02,104
Me.

393
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:09,111
Looks fucking good!

394
01:39:09,612 --> 01:39:11,780
Yeah. Good fucking.

395
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,635
What do we have here?

396
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:55,908
Put it back!

397
01:39:56,617 --> 01:39:59,703
That's why the picture's
dark in the middle!

398
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,544
I'm doing this
for nothing anyway!

399
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,713
That's only right.

400
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:13,217
Son of a bitch!

401
01:40:18,972 --> 01:40:20,474
I'm off!

402
01:40:20,599 --> 01:40:22,518
You can't do that!

403
01:40:22,768 --> 01:40:25,020
Come on. I'll put it back.

404
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:31,485
Go fuck yourself!

405
01:40:41,954 --> 01:40:43,497
Are you leaving?

406
01:40:55,592 --> 01:40:57,636
I don't believe it!

407
01:41:06,562 --> 01:41:08,105
Shit!

408
01:41:17,906 --> 01:41:21,577
- What's with the projectionist?
- He left.

409
01:41:22,536 --> 01:41:27,040
- What did you do to him?
- Look, I have to change the reels.

410
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:30,627
- What do I do without a projectionist?
- He'll be back.

411
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,629
Don't worry.
I'll fill in tonight.

412
01:41:32,755 --> 01:41:36,675
Do you know how?
Don't start pretending again.

413
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:02,678
Fuck this!

414
01:44:20,297 --> 01:44:23,091
Do you intend to stay the night?

415
01:44:26,511 --> 01:44:27,804
Yes.

416
01:44:42,277 --> 01:44:44,196
I'll show you something.

417
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,835
<i>Action, sex!</i>

418
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,005
<i>Ninety minutes of film
that TV could never -</i>

419
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:47,259
<i>Brutality, action, sex!</i>

420
01:45:47,384 --> 01:45:50,470
<i>Ninety minutes of film
that TV could never -</i>

421
01:46:45,734 --> 01:46:49,738
The other day a woman had
vaginal cramps here in the theater.

422
01:46:52,074 --> 01:46:54,826
My grandpa
had to call an ambulance.

423
01:46:57,871 --> 01:47:01,666
The woman and her lover
were carried off together.

424
01:47:07,089 --> 01:47:09,591
He couldn't get out of her.

425
01:47:14,012 --> 01:47:16,765
This morning I met a man

426
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,559
whose wife
killed herself last night.

427
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:22,604
She drove into a tree.

428
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:27,984
Yesterday I saw a woman

429
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:31,363
sitting in her garden in the sun
under a hair dryer,

430
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:34,991
her hands folded in her lap.

431
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:38,578
- Did you talk to that man?
- Yes.

432
01:47:39,454 --> 01:47:42,457
He said,
"Life is all there is."

433
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:45,460
But which life?

434
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:54,553
How do you live?

435
01:47:55,595 --> 01:47:59,558
I live alone with my daughter.
And that stays like that.

436
01:48:17,993 --> 01:48:19,661
Did you know

437
01:48:20,162 --> 01:48:22,998
that my mother died
when I was born?

438
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:27,627
What?

439
01:48:54,946 --> 01:48:56,656
Now what?

440
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:06,041
Now I'm in a fix too.

441
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,044
What?

442
01:49:16,885 --> 01:49:18,720
I'm tired.

443
01:50:39,467 --> 01:50:40,969
Father.

444
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:42,238
Have you got a pen?

445
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:52,040
Paper, too?

446
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:10,225
On the back.

447
01:52:11,184 --> 01:52:13,061
Don't you need it anymore?

448
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:17,148
Keep it.

449
01:52:18,733 --> 01:52:21,152
It's from Wolfsburg.

450
01:53:08,741 --> 01:53:10,368
I'm leaving.

451
01:56:00,663 --> 01:56:02,707
It's a good thing you're here.

452
01:56:03,291 --> 01:56:05,376
Wait a sec.

453
01:57:20,284 --> 01:57:23,871
HOW TO RESPECT A WOMAN

454
01:57:24,122 --> 01:57:26,374
You didn't sleep much, huh?

455
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:29,168
It wasn't a bad night, really,

456
01:57:29,502 --> 01:57:33,548
compared with the last few
in your traveling museum.

457
01:57:34,132 --> 01:57:37,510
- Did you get what you wanted?
- What do you mean?

458
01:57:37,844 --> 01:57:41,222
You published
a "special edition" overnight, right?

459
01:57:41,597 --> 01:57:44,016
It was supposed
to be a speech, really.

460
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,728
Did you have to make it?

461
01:57:50,481 --> 01:57:54,068
I mean, shouldn't you have left
the old man in peace?

462
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:56,404
I always have.

463
01:57:57,697 --> 01:57:59,741
He's never left me in peace.

464
01:58:01,075 --> 01:58:03,369
Maybe you can imagine.

465
01:58:04,871 --> 01:58:07,623
No. I never had a father.

466
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:11,836
He got lost in the war.

467
01:58:12,795 --> 01:58:15,173
How long
since you last saw him?

468
01:58:28,227 --> 01:58:30,438
Since my mother's death.

469
01:58:31,105 --> 01:58:32,607
Eight years!

470
01:58:34,275 --> 01:58:38,321
I thought the King of the Road
wasn't interested in stories.

471
01:58:41,657 --> 01:58:45,870
Where are we heading now?
- I've got business in Hassfurt.

472
01:58:46,746 --> 01:58:49,999
- At the C&C Cinema?
- You know it?

473
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:51,876
Oh, yes.

474
01:58:52,502 --> 01:58:55,463
As a kid I spent
all my money there.

475
01:58:56,172 --> 01:59:00,134
Secretly. I didn't dare go
to the movies in my town.

476
01:59:00,468 --> 01:59:03,471
Didn't you forget
a question mark in your headline?

477
01:59:03,638 --> 01:59:04,972
What?

478
01:59:05,723 --> 01:59:08,059
No, I left it out on purpose.

479
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:12,188
Did you learn all that -
typesetting and printing?

480
01:59:12,772 --> 01:59:14,273
Of course.

481
01:59:15,691 --> 01:59:19,320
Listen, do you really have to go
to the next theater?

482
01:59:19,612 --> 01:59:21,155
No.

483
01:59:22,615 --> 01:59:25,117
Let's go somewhere else then.

484
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,620
Like Genoa?

485
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:29,956
Not necessarily.

486
01:59:30,081 --> 01:59:31,499
Where then?

487
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:33,960
Where did you grow up?

488
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:36,170
On the Rhine.

489
01:59:36,337 --> 01:59:38,297
Just you and your mother?

490
01:59:38,631 --> 01:59:40,174
Yeah.

491
01:59:41,968 --> 01:59:43,636
Let's go there.

492
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:07,660
Everything looks the same.

493
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:09,453
We better hurry.

494
02:00:09,871 --> 02:00:11,789
Wind it up.

495
02:00:41,903 --> 02:00:43,779
Paul's still here.

496
02:01:18,105 --> 02:01:19,732
Paul!

497
02:01:20,691 --> 02:01:22,693
This is Bruno.

498
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:29,867
Remember
your dad's old BMW bike?

499
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:32,828
The one we used
to cruise around on?

500
02:01:33,454 --> 02:01:35,122
Without a license!

501
02:01:35,289 --> 02:01:37,416
You still got that old crate?

502
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:40,795
It's mine now.
And it still runs like a dream.

503
02:01:41,295 --> 02:01:43,798
Is it still in the garage?

504
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:06,696
Who do you think I met in Sicily?

505
02:02:07,405 --> 02:02:09,156
On Mount Etna.

506
02:02:11,242 --> 02:02:12,660
"Softly."

507
02:02:15,579 --> 02:02:17,123
"Softly"!

508
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,792
Geography.

509
02:02:20,876 --> 02:02:23,587
"Stand up, Paul!
Sit down, gasbag!"

510
02:02:31,721 --> 02:02:33,264
As security.

511
02:02:36,392 --> 02:02:38,102
Beat it, cat!

512
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:43,941
Paul, you still owe me something.

513
02:02:55,411 --> 02:02:58,080
Has he got
a driving license at all?

514
02:02:58,247 --> 02:03:00,332
He's Mike Hailwood's brother!

515
02:05:00,244 --> 02:05:01,745
Here!

516
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:03,747
On the island?

517
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,875
Yeah.

518
02:05:06,333 --> 02:05:07,960
There's a house.

519
02:05:09,044 --> 02:05:11,881
In summer
you can't see it from the bank.

520
02:05:12,214 --> 02:05:14,383
With that boat?

521
02:05:59,929 --> 02:06:02,223
The current's very strong!

522
02:06:03,098 --> 02:06:04,767
Don't worry.

523
02:06:05,684 --> 02:06:08,103
I used to watch how it's done.

524
02:10:19,188 --> 02:10:21,732
Can we sleep in the house?

525
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:23,734
No.

526
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:57,179
My, oh my!

527
02:13:03,602 --> 02:13:05,854
"Shortly before dawn..."

528
02:14:23,473 --> 02:14:25,392
What a noise!

529
02:14:26,518 --> 02:14:29,062
They're dredging the fairway.

530
02:14:38,822 --> 02:14:41,366
Can you still ride
the motorcycle?

531
02:14:41,783 --> 02:14:43,535
I think so.

532
02:14:46,121 --> 02:14:47,706
I'm too tired.

533
02:14:47,873 --> 02:14:49,833
I did sleep.

534
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:14,042
You're done?

535
02:16:15,043 --> 02:16:16,503
Yes, sure.

536
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:20,340
But I got talked
into showing the film tonight.

537
02:16:20,465 --> 02:16:23,176
The projectionist is sick,
and his grandma -

538
02:16:23,385 --> 02:16:25,220
How much do you get?

539
02:16:25,637 --> 02:16:27,305
Peanuts.

540
02:16:28,515 --> 02:16:30,600
Otherwise they'd have to cancel.

541
02:16:30,725 --> 02:16:33,019
Can you get me a free ticket?

542
02:16:34,437 --> 02:16:36,606
You can have some peanuts.

543
02:16:42,237 --> 02:16:45,907
I'm too good-natured.
- Has its good sides.

544
02:17:15,937 --> 02:17:17,772
"Good-natured"!

545
02:17:20,358 --> 02:17:22,235
How long does this go on?

546
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:25,363
Three more reels.

547
02:17:33,788 --> 02:17:36,958
How about leaving one out?

548
02:17:39,294 --> 02:17:40,921
Or two?

549
02:17:50,096 --> 02:17:51,598
Let's get going!

550
02:17:55,644 --> 02:17:58,688
- Stay cool.
- Let's not be conspicuous.

551
02:18:03,818 --> 02:18:07,197
- Be inconspicuous.
- Walk, don't run!

552
02:18:12,494 --> 02:18:14,120
Hang on!

553
02:18:14,537 --> 02:18:17,415
We have to go that way!
- That way?

554
02:18:30,553 --> 02:18:32,847
A waste of time...

555
02:18:36,518 --> 02:18:37,894
What?

556
02:18:39,646 --> 02:18:41,147
What's up?

557
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:44,109
What?

558
02:18:45,068 --> 02:18:46,778
You said something.

559
02:18:49,364 --> 02:18:51,574
What? What did you say?

560
02:19:03,294 --> 02:19:05,797
Everything's gone to sleep.

561
02:19:24,232 --> 02:19:25,734
Coffee.

562
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,902
I'm going to make me
some coffee.

563
02:20:17,869 --> 02:20:18,953
World champion.

564
02:22:10,231 --> 02:22:12,525
"Where the organ is."
Four letters.

565
02:22:13,610 --> 02:22:15,069
"Loft."

566
02:22:18,948 --> 02:22:21,951
Right.
Been down to the river?

567
02:22:23,244 --> 02:22:24,329
Yes.

568
02:22:34,505 --> 02:22:36,549
Think I could use the phone?

569
02:22:38,718 --> 02:22:40,637
If it's not long-distance.

570
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:43,723
But it is.

571
02:23:31,312 --> 02:23:32,814
It's me.

572
02:23:36,484 --> 02:23:38,319
How are you?

573
02:23:54,168 --> 02:23:56,546
- Are you the projectionist?
- Yes.

574
02:23:58,172 --> 02:23:59,799
Come along.

575
02:24:01,426 --> 02:24:05,805
- They didn't teach you much, huh?
- I learned by watching.

576
02:24:06,848 --> 02:24:09,350
You know
what a Maltese cross is?

577
02:24:10,268 --> 02:24:13,563
"Maltese"?
Some sort of booze?

578
02:24:25,575 --> 02:24:28,453
Didn't you notice
the picture was unsteady?

579
02:24:28,578 --> 02:24:30,580
No more than usual.

580
02:24:32,081 --> 02:24:33,875
Everything's filthy!

581
02:24:39,088 --> 02:24:41,090
This is chipped.

582
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:48,056
Without this little thing
there'd be no film industry.

583
02:24:50,058 --> 02:24:53,144
It draws the film
24 times a second

584
02:24:53,269 --> 02:24:55,355
one frame further on.

585
02:24:57,273 --> 02:25:01,110
It converts the torque
into a forward movement.

586
02:25:02,945 --> 02:25:04,405
That's clever.

587
02:25:07,742 --> 02:25:09,786
Where'd you get the jukebox?

588
02:25:10,036 --> 02:25:13,081
I swapped it for a projector.

589
02:25:13,748 --> 02:25:15,291
It's great.

590
02:25:16,084 --> 02:25:19,462
And you?
Had an accident?

591
02:25:19,796 --> 02:25:21,964
Yes, on my motorcycle.

592
02:26:47,216 --> 02:26:48,593
Go on.

593
02:26:57,518 --> 02:26:59,562
I've seen it done better.

594
02:27:16,454 --> 02:27:18,664
Do we carry
that socle down too?

595
02:27:19,373 --> 02:27:20,625
Yes.

596
02:27:41,062 --> 02:27:43,814
I'm glad we went to the Rhine.

597
02:27:46,442 --> 02:27:49,070
For the first time I see myself...

598
02:27:49,862 --> 02:27:53,366
as someone who's gone
through a certain time,

599
02:27:53,491 --> 02:27:56,244
and that time is my story.

600
02:27:58,746 --> 02:28:01,249
That feeling is quite comfortable.

601
02:29:13,946 --> 02:29:15,406
Shit!

602
02:29:15,990 --> 02:29:18,868
This is the border!
We can't go any further.

603
02:29:31,797 --> 02:29:34,300
Switch on the full beam.

604
02:29:50,983 --> 02:29:53,361
Watch out! They'll shoot you.

605
02:29:58,199 --> 02:30:00,034
Bring the whiskey!

606
02:30:25,726 --> 02:30:27,895
From the Yanks.

607
02:30:29,313 --> 02:30:30,815
Holiday Inn?

608
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:33,442
Not really, but still...

609
02:30:33,943 --> 02:30:36,862
beds, pictures.

610
02:30:52,336 --> 02:30:55,631
Let's get the mattresses
out of the truck.

611
02:31:45,097 --> 02:31:48,976
- Here's something for you!
- Don't talk crap.

612
02:31:49,226 --> 02:31:52,271
A pediatrician
shouldn't be so sensitive.

613
02:31:59,320 --> 02:32:01,322
I'm not a pediatrician.

614
02:32:01,655 --> 02:32:03,324
You said you were.

615
02:32:09,747 --> 02:32:11,290
Well, yes...

616
02:32:13,417 --> 02:32:16,754
I work in a border area
between linguistics

617
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:19,632
and pediatrics.
- So you are one.

618
02:32:20,841 --> 02:32:22,927
I don't treat anybody.

619
02:32:23,052 --> 02:32:25,513
I evaluate research
on the first months

620
02:32:25,638 --> 02:32:28,349
of learning to read and write.

621
02:32:29,725 --> 02:32:31,685
What happens then?

622
02:32:32,061 --> 02:32:33,813
At that stage...

623
02:32:34,396 --> 02:32:37,525
letters and numbers
are still an adventure.

624
02:32:39,026 --> 02:32:41,862
Later, when writing
becomes routine...

625
02:32:43,864 --> 02:32:47,034
this imaginative phase
is forgotten.

626
02:32:47,535 --> 02:32:49,870
Only the impediments

627
02:32:50,204 --> 02:32:54,875
sometimes occasioned
by these fantasies remain.

628
02:33:07,888 --> 02:33:09,807
There was one boy...

629
02:33:12,393 --> 02:33:16,105
To him lines were paths...

630
02:33:17,898 --> 02:33:20,860
along which the letters moved

631
02:33:20,985 --> 02:33:25,614
by means of a motorbike,
the pen.

632
02:33:28,951 --> 02:33:32,121
"I" and "E"
always rode together.

633
02:33:33,455 --> 02:33:36,375
"I" was clever and sharp.

634
02:33:38,252 --> 02:33:41,088
That makes me "I" and you "E."

635
02:33:47,595 --> 02:33:49,680
And for him...

636
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:53,142
"L" was stupid and lazy...

637
02:33:53,851 --> 02:33:55,436
a crook...

638
02:33:56,687 --> 02:33:58,898
living in the underworld...

639
02:33:59,815 --> 02:34:02,026
all dirty and evil.

640
02:34:02,776 --> 02:34:04,445
"Mean."

641
02:34:07,531 --> 02:34:09,074
What?

642
02:34:12,745 --> 02:34:15,581
Sometimes I have
a tune in my head

643
02:34:16,457 --> 02:34:19,960
for hours on end,
with English lyrics,

644
02:34:20,711 --> 02:34:23,422
without paying attention
to the words,

645
02:34:23,714 --> 02:34:25,424
and suddenly -

646
02:34:26,342 --> 02:34:28,969
Once I had a quarrel
with my girlfriend,

647
02:34:29,136 --> 02:34:32,389
and I hummed
a tune the whole time,

648
02:34:32,514 --> 02:34:34,808
even while
she was screaming at me.

649
02:34:34,975 --> 02:34:37,561
Then I left the house,

650
02:34:38,145 --> 02:34:40,898
and outside I suddenly
remembered the lyrics.

651
02:35:00,042 --> 02:35:04,630
The Yanks have colonized
our subconscious!

652
02:37:12,508 --> 02:37:17,471
You were not ashamed
to really give it a try!

653
02:37:18,555 --> 02:37:21,433
I even got
the American operator.

654
02:37:28,649 --> 02:37:31,151
I should've asked
for Lynchburg, Tennessee.

655
02:37:31,318 --> 02:37:34,571
Why don't you go back
to your wife

656
02:37:34,696 --> 02:37:37,533
if you can't stand
being without her?

657
02:37:38,575 --> 02:37:40,327
That's impossible.

658
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:43,205
Why is that?

659
02:37:45,457 --> 02:37:48,794
I'm no longer myself
when I'm with her.

660
02:37:49,837 --> 02:37:53,215
Then why do you keep
calling her?

661
02:37:55,676 --> 02:37:58,637
I'm afraid she might try
to kill herself.

662
02:38:02,391 --> 02:38:04,393
You fucking coward!

663
02:38:06,603 --> 02:38:09,189
You're afraid of yourself.

664
02:38:10,023 --> 02:38:12,901
That way you'll really kill her.

665
02:38:14,153 --> 02:38:15,863
She'll get by.

666
02:38:16,446 --> 02:38:19,658
- You don't even know her.
- But I know you!

667
02:38:24,163 --> 02:38:27,040
You don't know
what you're talking about.

668
02:38:28,208 --> 02:38:31,670
You sit in your truck
like it's some kind of bunker...

669
02:38:32,754 --> 02:38:35,883
and talk big
about "being alone."

670
02:38:36,717 --> 02:38:39,052
Nothing can happen to you.

671
02:38:39,178 --> 02:38:41,263
Enough has happened to me!

672
02:38:41,388 --> 02:38:44,349
But not anymore!
You're as good as dead!

673
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,227
Is there any desire left in you?

674
02:38:54,109 --> 02:38:55,569
Asshole!

675
02:39:35,776 --> 02:39:37,778
I have a great desire.

676
02:39:40,530 --> 02:39:42,241
For a woman.

677
02:39:42,991 --> 02:39:44,826
Any woman.

678
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:51,458
Every woman makes me yearn.

679
02:39:52,459 --> 02:39:55,254
I think every man feels that way.

680
02:39:55,545 --> 02:39:57,798
And because I know this

681
02:39:57,965 --> 02:40:01,134
and can't pretend
not to know it...

682
02:40:01,885 --> 02:40:05,055
I'm keeping away from women.

683
02:40:06,265 --> 02:40:10,811
I know she could be
a different woman from the one she is.

684
02:40:13,981 --> 02:40:17,609
I don't know
how one can live with a woman.

685
02:40:17,734 --> 02:40:19,653
If it isn't possible...

686
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:23,490
then it has to become possible.

687
02:40:25,158 --> 02:40:27,452
It's no life at all...

688
02:40:29,454 --> 02:40:34,167
if you're no longer able
to imagine any changes...

689
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:37,004
nor want any.

690
02:40:38,422 --> 02:40:40,716
Of course I want...

691
02:40:44,386 --> 02:40:47,806
to be one with a woman.

692
02:40:49,725 --> 02:40:52,519
But just as much
I want to be alone.

693
02:40:54,187 --> 02:40:56,857
I will never give that up again.

694
02:40:58,692 --> 02:41:01,361
A contradiction
you have to put up with.

695
02:41:03,530 --> 02:41:05,490
Nor do I believe...

696
02:41:07,701 --> 02:41:09,202
in...

697
02:41:13,081 --> 02:41:18,003
For instance, when you're fucking,
you're inside a woman.

698
02:41:19,796 --> 02:41:24,468
But have you ever had the feeling
of really being with her?

699
02:41:28,055 --> 02:41:30,932
I've always felt lonely
inside a woman.

700
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:37,689
Lonely to the marrow.

701
02:41:54,873 --> 02:41:58,085
I can't imagine you fucking at all.

702
02:42:05,801 --> 02:42:08,220
I can see you, though.

703
02:42:08,637 --> 02:42:12,474
You're panting
like in a badly dubbed porno film.

704
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:52,277
"Everything must change.
So long. R."

705
02:46:51,544 --> 02:46:53,421
What are you writing?

706
02:46:53,838 --> 02:46:57,300
I'm describing a train station.
Everything I see.

707
02:46:58,802 --> 02:47:00,887
And what do you see?

708
02:47:01,596 --> 02:47:05,600
The tracks,
the gravel, the timetable,

709
02:47:05,850 --> 02:47:07,435
the sky,

710
02:47:07,894 --> 02:47:09,646
the clouds.

711
02:47:15,485 --> 02:47:17,904
A man with a suitcase.

712
02:47:19,614 --> 02:47:22,200
An empty suitcase!

713
02:47:22,575 --> 02:47:24,411
A grin.

714
02:47:26,371 --> 02:47:28,748
A black eye.

715
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,544
A fist...

716
02:47:37,757 --> 02:47:39,718
throwing a stone.

717
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:45,181
- It's as easy as that?
- That easy!

718
02:47:56,943 --> 02:47:59,446
If you give me your notebook,

719
02:47:59,779 --> 02:48:03,283
you get my glasses
and my suitcase.

720
02:48:17,213 --> 02:48:19,382
That's a good deal.

721
02:48:46,284 --> 02:48:47,744
Good.

722
02:48:48,328 --> 02:48:50,330
I'll do my best.

723
02:49:10,016 --> 02:49:12,268
BORDER

724
02:50:56,789 --> 02:51:00,460
Kamikaze,
don't think I didn't see you!

725
02:51:01,502 --> 02:51:03,630
Getting by better and better, eh?

726
02:51:27,987 --> 02:51:30,865
- Not showing anymore?
- No.

727
02:51:31,741 --> 02:51:34,994
But I keep the theater ready
to reopen any time.

728
02:51:36,955 --> 02:51:40,750
"Film is the art of seeing,"
my father said.

729
02:51:44,212 --> 02:51:46,923
That's why
I can't show these films

730
02:51:47,215 --> 02:51:50,301
that are nothing but exploitation

731
02:51:50,426 --> 02:51:54,639
of all that can be exploited
in people's eyes and minds.

732
02:51:57,350 --> 02:52:00,812
I won't be forced to show films

733
02:52:00,937 --> 02:52:04,899
where people stagger out stunned
and rigid with stupidity...

734
02:52:05,775 --> 02:52:09,821
films that kill
any joy of life inside them...

735
02:52:10,822 --> 02:52:15,034
and destroy any feeling
for themselves and the world.

736
02:52:34,012 --> 02:52:37,890
My father wanted this town
to go on having a theater.

737
02:52:38,266 --> 02:52:39,934
Me too.

738
02:52:40,393 --> 02:52:44,147
But the way it is now,
it's better to have no theater

739
02:52:44,564 --> 02:52:48,359
than a theater
the way it is now.
