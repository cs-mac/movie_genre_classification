1
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,316
You look nice.

2
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,361
Not bad.

3
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,359
Really nice.

4
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:18,356
I just went out for a walk.

5
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:24,350
I must bring a chair, you go with me?

6
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,345
I shouldn't have taken
the chair with me.

7
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:34,341
It's of no use here.

8
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:36,339
It's a stupid idea
to have a rest here.

9
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,338
The livestock here...

10
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,335
...they don't stop
making noise every night.

11
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:42,334
I cannot sleep well.

12
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,332
It's really bad.

13
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,331
You must tell this to my father.

14
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:47,330
It's useless to tell me about this.

15
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,324
I don't like the livestock.

16
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:56,321
Since you don't like here,
why did you come here for a vacation?

17
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,320
I don't know the reason either.

18
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,398
It's very clean here.

19
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:05,393
Nothing to worry about.

20
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:07,391
Nothing will happen.

21
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,378
Has everything been ready?

22
00:06:22,378 --> 00:06:24,376
Damn, something goes wrong again.

23
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,375
Do you need a hand?

24
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:29,372
No, the TV is still all right.

25
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,369
I don't know what is wrong with it.

26
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:34,367
It's really a mess.

27
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,365
You go to the kitchen first.

28
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:40,362
Get me something to eat.

29
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:44,358
May I come in?

30
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:46,356
Sure.

31
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,402
I plan to play the movie inside.

32
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,401
It's unnecessary
to go to the cinema.

33
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,399
The screen is sill in need.

34
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,396
What you are doing is
all for playing the movie.

35
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,395
Yes.

36
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:35,392
When you finsh
then you give me a message.

37
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:36,391
Not yet.

38
00:07:36,391 --> 00:07:40,387
You know it's not really simple.

39
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,386
What's the content?

40
00:07:41,386 --> 00:07:43,385
What's the content?

41
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:45,383
No dialog, only monolog.

42
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:48,380
My mom and the others
will not really understand this.

43
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,377
They won't like it.

44
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,377
But it's interesting for you.

45
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:54,375
Then you keep it on.

46
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:58,371
Don't waste time.

47
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,448
This would be better.

48
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,447
Julien, you always have
the braveness expcept the idea.

49
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:06,444
You are in the daydream.

50
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,442
I cannot understand this.

51
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,439
I want to have a rest.

52
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,459
Am I late?

53
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,457
No.

54
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,455
It's all right.

55
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:25,452
My dad don't allow me to come here.

56
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:28,450
He said the persons
who made movies were crazy.

57
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,448
He's right.

58
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,446
I'm happy to be a crazy person.

59
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,444
He's right.

60
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,441
I'm sorry, I didn't notice you.

61
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,440
Hello.

62
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,439
Hello.

63
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:44,435
It seems that it's me
who trouble you all.

64
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:47,433
How long can you fix that stuff?

65
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:49,431
One hour.

66
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,424
Look at this.

67
00:09:56,424 --> 00:10:00,421
I show you from the beginning.

68
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:12,410
I'm a little scared.

69
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,396
Don't you think that this
will be very abstract?

70
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,396
Abstract?

71
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:32,392
Yes, abstract, not real.

72
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,389
Why?

73
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,387
What's the reality?

74
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,386
Not like the shrug here.

75
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,384
I'm asking you what
the reality is, you think.

76
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:43,382
Brice's movies,
you maybe think those bad.

77
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:47,378
I think their movies
make people feel boring.

78
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,376
They did not vey badly.

79
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:51,375
You make me scared.

80
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,373
His last movie is the
worst one my mom shot.

81
00:10:53,373 --> 00:10:56,370
He's just a movie bureaucrat.

82
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,447
He has something with
the culture minister.

83
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,445
Listen.

84
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,443
She got the letter, but she didn't open that.

85
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:06,441
She thought there was two kinds
of people could write letters.

86
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,439
One is the people who wantto get the reward.

87
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:10,438
The other is the people
who tell the story personally.

88
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:12,436
You must be the first one.

89
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:13,435
What?

90
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:15,433
I'm not like the chinese women
who are so sensitive.

91
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,431
What I'm now caring about
is the sunshine protection.

92
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:19,429
Protect the skin.

93
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:45,406
Whatever, it's done.

94
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:49,402
I could have a sleep.

95
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:54,398
I dreamed that I could not sleep.

96
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,397
Is it funny?

97
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:56,396
I could have a rest.

98
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,394
I forgot.

99
00:11:58,394 --> 00:11:59,393
It's a long time
that I haven't had the nap.

100
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:00,472
It really drives me crazy.

101
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:03,470
Once I dreamed of my little son.

102
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,469
He's 12 years old.

103
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:07,466
My sister is also in my dream.

104
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,464
By chance...

105
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:13,461
I was 12 years old at that time.

106
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,446
What's this?

107
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:31,444
Damn.

108
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:32,443
Wait.

109
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,443
Me?

110
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,441
No, it's me.

111
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,438
It's me whose nose is bleeding.

112
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:42,434
My nose will bleed
if I use some strength.

113
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,427
Where has your mother gone?

114
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:51,426
The movie of Julien will be played.

115
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,425
The time is near.

116
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:56,422
What are you doing?
Do you think it funny?

117
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,498
I've got drunk.

118
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,480
Hey.

119
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,478
I don't know where she is.

120
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:25,476
Your wife is so boring.

121
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,474
It's the best time to play the movie.

122
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,473
OK, stop.

123
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,472
Dad, shall we go?

124
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,470
Did you see your mom?

125
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,468
I don't know either.

126
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:45,458
I know.

127
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,456
He's there.

128
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,452
I'm sorry to be late.

129
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:53,450
The doctors are always busy.

130
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,448
Really?

131
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,447
Let's go, Julien is waiting for us.

132
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:58,446
Hello, doc.

133
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,445
Do you want some advice?

134
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,444
Yes.

135
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,443
Wait.

136
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:02,442
Look. She's coming.

137
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:03,441
Mom is coming.

138
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:07,438
We are all waiting for you.

139
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:09,436
Where have you gone?

140
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:13,432
I've gone to change my clothes.

141
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,419
Here are chairs.

142
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:32,415
Please be seated.

143
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,413
May I have a smoke?

144
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:35,412
No.

145
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:37,411
I must have one.

146
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,410
How many cigars do you have everyday?

147
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,409
At least three.

148
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:43,405
Then you can only live till 40.

149
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:44,404
What's the movie?

150
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:46,402
Short movie.

151
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:47,402
No one sit here.

152
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,400
Thanks, Julien.

153
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,395
He's so kind that he
remembers my back illness.

154
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,393
This is Lili,
the actress of this movie.

155
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:57,393
Nice to meet you.

156
00:14:57,393 --> 00:14:59,391
Nice to meet you.

157
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,389
Is the movies finshed?

158
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,387
Yes, by myself.

159
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,386
Yourself?

160
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:07,383
I finish it with a partner
with the computer.

161
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:09,382
You are really great!

162
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:11,380
Glad to see this.

163
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,379
Is everything ready?

164
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,375
Yes, I've put the tape in the player.

165
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,374
You didn't tell me you are ok.

166
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,373
Just to make him happy.

167
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,372
Please sit down.

168
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,370
I go to close the door.

169
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,367
Don't fall asleep.

170
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,365
Is everyone here?

171
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:29,364
Yes.

172
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:30,363
OK, let's begin.

173
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,360
These actors are all like the people
who share the common genes.

174
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,358
OK, action.

175
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:39,355
Damn, where is the remote control?

176
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,353
It must be really nice.

177
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:42,352
Thank you, you are so nice.

178
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:45,349
I'm not falttering.

179
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:48,346
I often did something stupid
when I made the movies before.

180
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:52,343
I consider the actors
as the ticket for the money.

181
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:53,342
You are all the audience.

182
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,340
That's the old idea.

183
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,339
It depends...

184
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,337
The old actor is really natural.

185
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:00,376
More truly.

186
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,374
Nature is nothing to me.

187
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:03,373
It's true to have the house to live in.

188
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:04,372
Stop talking.

189
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:05,371
It's about to begin.

190
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,369
I make movies not for selling
something natural.

191
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:09,367
It's ok to beign.

192
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:16,361
No subtitles in the beginning.

193
00:16:16,361 --> 00:16:20,358
Damn, I cannot hear anything.

194
00:16:25,353 --> 00:16:27,351
I want to sit there.

195
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:34,345
I go with you.

196
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,367
I want some water.

197
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:57,350
Man.

198
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,348
Lion.

199
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:01,426
Glede.

200
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,424
Snake.

201
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,421
Spider.

202
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,419
Silent fish.

203
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,416
The shrimp in the pool.

204
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,414
Starfish.

205
00:18:14,414 --> 00:18:17,412
They all have a kind of strength.

206
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,410
The love for the life.

207
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,406
All the life.

208
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,404
All the life has its own mark.

209
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,401
But it will disappear finally.

210
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,398
We cannot say this...

211
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:34,396
For thousands of years...

212
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,394
Nothing alive can live on the ground.

213
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:39,392
But this poor moon...

214
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:43,388
It gives out the light in vain.

215
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:47,385
On the grassland the horn stops.

216
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:52,380
The songs of birds in the tree
cannot be heard.

217
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:57,376
The shell of life becomes the dust.

218
00:18:57,376 --> 00:19:00,453
The forever matter changes them into...

219
00:19:00,453 --> 00:19:03,450
...rock, water and cloud.

220
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,447
Their soul is connected together.

221
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:12,442
The soul of man and animal is connected.

222
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,437
I can remember all this.

223
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,435
All this.

224
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:24,431
All this.

225
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,427
I can even feel the living
of every knid of life from my body.

226
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,424
OK, stop.

227
00:19:32,424 --> 00:19:33,423
What happened?

228
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,420
You don't really care this,
you make me bored.

229
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,419
Wait.

230
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,418
It needs people to think, doesn't it?

231
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,416
You are a boring woman!

232
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,413
You are a boring person!

233
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:47,410
We are all waiting to say something.

234
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,409
Especially when you show it to the people
you must wait for the commments.

235
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,407
What criticism are you talking about?

236
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:54,404
Do you want us to see the movie
you shot with him?

237
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,402
I can also say my feeling, if you like.

238
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,401
Listen, you make me feel boring.

239
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:01,398
Are you clear?

240
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,395
So rude!

241
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,394
He's the rurigenous person.

242
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,392
You are so pushing.

243
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:11,389
Why are you so angry?

244
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,387
We cannot talk with this kind
of kids like him.

245
00:20:13,387 --> 00:20:15,385
Why?

246
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,384
Am I not right?

247
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:17,383
Nothing.

248
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,382
The young directors are all the same.

249
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:20,381
They all praise well.

250
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:22,379
He showed us somehing unintelligible.

251
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:23,378
He thinks it wonderful.

252
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:26,375
This is my genius son.

253
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,373
But your reaction is beyond of control.

254
00:20:28,373 --> 00:20:31,371
I don't think so.

255
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:34,368
Lili, I don't mean this to you.

256
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:38,364
I think your performance is really good.

257
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:57,347
Your son wants to do better.

258
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:59,345
Boring, this is normal.

259
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,424
The young men are all like this.

260
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,423
No, no, the young men are not like this.

261
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,421
Not boasting, not naive.

262
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,420
He thinks himself an angel.

263
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,418
He's a fool.

264
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:10,415
Overconfidence, pride,
he makes all the people tired.

265
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:12,414
He's gone.

266
00:21:12,414 --> 00:21:14,412
I don't feel well.

267
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:15,411
Don't talk to me about somethin
with the young men.

268
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:17,409
The so called young men.

269
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,406
Go to hell.

270
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:24,403
Do you know where he's going?

271
00:21:24,403 --> 00:21:26,401
Dunno.

272
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,397
He thinks himself a genius.

273
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,396
Nothing.

274
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:36,392
We are used to this,

275
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,386
We all like your performance.

276
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,384
Do you like it?

277
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:47,382
Very much.

278
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:48,381
Me too.

279
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:50,379
Nice.

280
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:54,376
Pay attention to this compliment.

281
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,448
Wait, do you really think so?

282
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:03,448
I always tell the truth.

283
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,445
Or else I will shut my mouth.

284
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:09,442
It's not easy to shot the movie like this.

285
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:11,440
You will fall into it sometimes.

286
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,439
Do you think that it's a little too free?

287
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,437
Yes, surely.

288
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:19,433
You must have a feeling,
a feeling without life.

289
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:20,432
Tell him.

290
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,430
I told him about this.

291
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,428
Once in the vacation here...

292
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:28,425
...we spent summer here.

293
00:22:28,425 --> 00:22:31,422
It would be nice that we can sing again.

294
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:33,420
We sang until late.

295
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,419
With something popular.

296
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,417
You sing nice.

297
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,415
You can sing for such a long time,
I like it.

298
00:22:39,415 --> 00:22:41,413
I still remember...

299
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:42,412
...when you danced on the Mantile Island.

300
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:45,410
Oh, Mantile Island,
Simon, do you remember?

301
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,408
Listen, the animated shot is just like this.

302
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:50,405
Dad, at that time on the Mantile Island.

303
00:22:50,405 --> 00:22:53,402
Those songs made me feel sad.

304
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:56,400
Do you remember that?

305
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,397
Soemtimes we will fall in the movie,
won't we?

306
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,476
Yes.

307
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:02,474
Becasue of something you are doing now?

308
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:06,471
No, because of something we cannot do.

309
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,463
Can you make the dog stop barking?

310
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:16,462
My dog, for the safety.

311
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,460
We are not afraid of thieves.

312
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:23,455
Come on, eat something.

313
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,442
Wait, Julien.

314
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,433
Not bad.

315
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,432
It's your idea.

316
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:50,431
Are you OK?

317
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:52,429
Don't talk to me like this.

318
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,426
So softly and slowly,
it seems that I'm a patient.

319
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:56,425
I don't treat you like a patient.

320
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:57,425
I know.

321
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:59,423
Listen, leave me alone.

322
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:02,500
I want to be alone and don't
need any comfort.

323
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,499
You go this way.

324
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:04,498
Go.

325
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,496
See you.

326
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:30,475
You can help us, Jeanne-Marie,
we won't stop you.

327
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:44,462
This cigar is not bad.

328
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:45,461
Thank you.

329
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:47,459
Not bad.

330
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,458
There are moe in my car,
if you like it.

331
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,455
This, very interesting.

332
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:54,453
I have no time to go there.

333
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:57,450
OK, have dinner,
the beef and the aubergine.

334
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,449
No, if you like you can do better.

335
00:24:59,449 --> 00:25:01,527
This is my body.

336
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:04,524
This is my life.

337
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,522
OK, Simon, have dinner.

338
00:25:06,522 --> 00:25:08,520
You are talking about
something impossible.

339
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,519
You think this naive.

340
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,517
You do everything.

341
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:16,513
Do you think so?

342
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:21,509
I must go.

343
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:22,508
Now?

344
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:23,507
I must catch the last boat.

345
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,505
Are you leaving?

346
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:26,504
Yes, I've got to go.

347
00:25:26,504 --> 00:25:27,503
It's a pity.

348
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:30,500
We should talk about the movie.

349
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm also happy to talk about that.

350
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,498
But I can't, my dad will kill me.

351
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,496
OK, byebye.

352
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:37,494
Bye.

353
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,493
See you all.

354
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,491
I'd better go now.

355
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,491
See you, Mimi.

356
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:42,490
Your movie is wonderful.

357
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,489
Thank you.

358
00:25:43,489 --> 00:25:44,488
See you, Mimi

359
00:25:44,488 --> 00:25:45,487
See you.

360
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:46,486
See you, Mimi.

361
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:48,484
See you.

362
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:56,477
I must have some fresh air.

363
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:59,474
So many people here are shouting
like a dog!

364
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,553
Why do you say so?

365
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:02,551
Maybe I'm wrong.

366
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:03,551
You are right.

367
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:04,550
But why did you sa so?

368
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,548
That girl looked at you.

369
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,546
I didn't have more words with her.

370
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:10,544
I swear.

371
00:26:10,544 --> 00:26:14,541
The man like you will make trouble
with the beautiful women.

372
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,536
It's Julien.

373
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,534
OK, I will go.

374
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,524
You here?

375
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,516
Believe or not,
but I think you are a genius.

376
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,515
I'm flattering you.

377
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:44,514
Do you have to say this? Because...

378
00:26:44,514 --> 00:26:46,512
No, you, wait.

379
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:47,511
I'm not your actor.

380
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,510
Let me finish my words.

381
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,507
Because I won't tell lies
to the guy I appreciate.

382
00:26:51,507 --> 00:26:54,505
I'm not the only one.

383
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,503
You impress us so deeply
just like your mother.

384
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:57,502
Do you understand?

385
00:26:57,502 --> 00:27:01,578
She's not so fashionable,
either is with you.

386
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:06,574
I like your movie very much.

387
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:10,570
I find many sparking points.

388
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,567
It's very good for you.

389
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:16,565
You won't always shut your mouth.

390
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:17,564
Hmm.

391
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:19,562
Ok, say something.

392
00:27:19,562 --> 00:27:21,560
Say anything you want.

393
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,556
Be yourself, you are Julien.

394
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,554
You are right about the discussion
of the reality.

395
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:32,550
We haven't discussed the problem
of eternality.

396
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,548
You are the artist, while I'm not.

397
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:38,545
No, this is because I am fond of it.

398
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,537
OK, see you.

399
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,529
I send you back.

400
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:57,528
No, thanks.

401
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,604
I cannot sleep at night.

402
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:02,603
Oh, you know that.

403
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,601
Everyone has his own role.

404
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,599
Mado, Julien

405
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,598
Everyone appricates the stuff
standing on the different spots.

406
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:09,597
What they see is different.

407
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:10,596
So this cannot work.

408
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:12,594
You don't like the movie of Julien?

409
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:14,592
I like it.

410
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,590
I think this is a wonderful movie.

411
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,589
Just like him.

412
00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:22,585
His favorite is so pure like water.

413
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,583
What are you doing?

414
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:25,582
You are smoking again, Jeanne.

415
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,580
Don't tell this to my dad.

416
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
Your dad is right.

417
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,578
He's not a boring guy.

418
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,576
He is, a stupid guy.

419
00:28:32,576 --> 00:28:36,572
You don't understand him.

420
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,570
wait.

421
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,565
You.

422
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,563
Do you think I'm attractive?

423
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:49,561
Attractive? Of course!

424
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,559
Do you want to make love with me?

425
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,558
Do you want to make love with me?

426
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:54,556
No, of course not.

427
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:56,554
You are not strong enough.

428
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:01,630
I just want to know if you want
to make live with me, that's all.

429
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,627
What's the difference?

430
00:29:04,627 --> 00:29:06,625
Some people are very voluntary.

431
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,623
What's your point?

432
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,622
You are right.

433
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:13,619
We are originally talking
about the movie of Julien.

434
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,617
Of course.

435
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:17,615
Apparently.

436
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:20,613
Damn.

437
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:23,610
Julien won't like you, Jeanne.

438
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,608
He hasn't grown up.

439
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,606
Can't you see that?

440
00:29:27,606 --> 00:29:29,604
What's more...

441
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:36,598
You are really amazing

442
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:45,590
All the people are in my house!
I'm fed up with it!

443
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,586
Good bye, doctor. Good night!

444
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,565
Look.

445
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,560
It's always the same.

446
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,557
Look! I come across her in my way.

447
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:24,555
No, I used to have a bike

448
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,553
As light as yours.

449
00:30:26,553 --> 00:30:30,549
So happy to see you.

450
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,547
What's the party for?

451
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:37,543
I'm very happy. My father took a holiday
on weekend with his girlfriend.

452
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,541
I can be quiet for some days.

453
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:42,539
Then you can stay here
for another several days.

454
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,538
That's great.

455
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:44,537
Of course, if you all agree.

456
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:46,535
Why not?

457
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:48,533
Don't leave any more.

458
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:50,531
It's really fine for me to be here.

459
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:53,529
I want to live with you.

460
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:55,527
I like you. I love you.

461
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:57,525
Me too.

462
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:58,524
So do I.

463
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,522
Agnes went to pick some flowers.

464
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:02,520
I'll go to visit Julien.

465
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,519
Oh! I forgot to tell you Julien is not here.

466
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,517
He and Brice had gone to Paris
together this morning.

467
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:08,515
They are going to make a film.

468
00:31:08,515 --> 00:31:09,514
Oh.

469
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:11,512
There went out all the directors?

470
00:31:11,512 --> 00:31:13,511
Yes.

471
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:20,504
Oh, don't be upset.

472
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,503
They haven't gone yet.

473
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:22,502
The big one went to buy fungus.

474
00:31:22,502 --> 00:31:24,501
What about the kid?

475
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,499
I don' t know where he is.

476
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:27,498
don't worry.

477
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:31,494
You will see him jump out.

478
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:32,493
14.9. Not so bad.

479
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:33,492
14.9?

480
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:37,489
You see? Sometimes,
you make little tricks.

481
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:45,482
What can I do for you?

482
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:48,479
No. Thank you. But it's all prepared.

483
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,476
What did Julien do yesterday?

484
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,474
Do you understand?

485
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:57,471
He is in a grouch with his friends.

486
00:31:57,471 --> 00:31:59,469
I don't know.

487
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,467
Me neither.

488
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:05,464
This is Julien. It's his style.

489
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:07,462
It's not hard to understand.

490
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:09,460
For him, movie is life,

491
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,459
Something saintly.

492
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,458
Right! So what?

493
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:12,457
how can we go that far to adore him?

494
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:14,455
No. He's a pure-hearted person.

495
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:16,454
We ought to be pure-hearted
in front of him.

496
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:17,453
But it doesn't work.

497
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,451
Are we still not pure-hearted enough?

498
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:20,450
Aren't we?

499
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,446
This is his new production.

500
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,446
We can't talk with you
about these things, Mado.

501
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:27,444
It's very important to his job.

502
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,442
Fine.

503
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:32,439
Life will not stop.
We have to learn to try something.

504
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:35,436
Nothing worths complaining.

505
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,435
You are not in my side.

506
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:38,434
I am!

507
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,432
Let me help you.

508
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:41,431
No.

509
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:42,430
Why not?

510
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,429
Take it.

511
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,428
Take this on my thumb.

512
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:46,427
Good. Take it to others.

513
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:47,426
There.

514
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,424
Yes. Come on!

515
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:01,453
He should beat you.

516
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:03,451
Beat me?

517
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:31,426
It's a nice place.

518
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,425
Good night.

519
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:34,423
What happen?

520
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:38,420
I haven't slept yet. I'm hearing you talking.

521
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,416
No matter what, I can only sleep
because the doctor didn't willing to treat me.

522
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:46,412
No one is not willing to help
a seventy-year-old ill man.

523
00:33:46,412 --> 00:33:47,411
It's.

524
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:48,411
I still want to live.

525
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,410
You are 70?

526
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,408
You are kidding!

527
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,405
I'm at least 30 years younger in your eyes.

528
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:57,402
You smoke. And drink.

529
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,402
Old man, that's not good.

530
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:00,480
Are you criticizing me?

531
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,476
The salts I've ever had are much more
than the meals you had.

532
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,475
You're really a fool.

533
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:07,473
Just you said I'm smart?

534
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,472
You are very clever, but certainly foolish.

535
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:12,469
You haven't mentioned the effort
of the treatment yet?

536
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,467
To tell the truth, it somehow works.

537
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:18,463
I don't know how he can manage it.

538
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:22,460
He even starts a clinic.

539
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,457
You do have endurance to your patients.

540
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:28,454
Don't you kiss the ugliest woman
in this flat?

541
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:32,451
Ok. I'll go to walk.

542
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:36,447
Anyway, It's bad to be exiled.

543
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:38,445
You're right.

544
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,444
I don't quite like this.

545
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,442
Even the world is cruel.

546
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,440
Life is serious.

547
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,436
Yes, serious.

548
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,434
I have been living. But I got nothing.

549
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:55,430
Just like what it is now

550
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,505
I once waited in my life.
Do you know, little girl?

551
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:01,505
But things never came.

552
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:03,503
Nothing.

553
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:07,499
I'm a total loser.

554
00:35:08,498 --> 00:35:12,495
Life is short.

555
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,493
To be honest, life is short.

556
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:17,490
Life is not short.

557
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,488
It exists, and then disappears.

558
00:35:19,488 --> 00:35:20,487
You see, not complicated.

559
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:24,484
Life is impenetrable,
ridiculous and nonsense.

560
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:28,480
In what direction does
the rain in the sky drops?

561
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,478
And how about the sun?

562
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:32,477
Are you joking me?

563
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,475
You are right.

564
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:37,472
People will die one day.

565
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:41,468
We will keep on doing these.

566
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,457
I once dreamt about you.

567
00:35:54,457 --> 00:35:55,456
Oh?

568
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:56,455
It seemed to be the end of this world.

569
00:35:56,455 --> 00:36:00,531
This is really funny thing.

570
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:02,529
Is that true?

571
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:06,526
What's true?

572
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:09,523
OK, fungus.

573
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:14,519
You are not only my sister's lover
but also a capable child.

574
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,518
Are these OK?

575
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:18,515
I don't know. I'm not an expert
for the colors and the tastes.

576
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:19,514
These are fine.

577
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:21,512
But not these.

578
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,511
What about these?

579
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:23,510
Good!

580
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,509
These are Mousse Mushrooms.
I like them very much.

581
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:27,507
Very delicious.

582
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,504
Are they Mali Mushrooms?

583
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,503
They are Mali Mushrooms.

584
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:35,500
Arhh£¬here we have Mousse Mushrooms,
Mali Mushrooms.

585
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,497
I had tasted Mali Mushrooms.

586
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:42,493
This is a kind of fungus
that can make people forget everything.

587
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,491
That guy does is foxy.

588
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,489
He thought I didn't go there.

589
00:36:47,489 --> 00:36:50,486
Of course I went afterwards.

590
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:54,482
I just forgot it an the very beginning.

591
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,481
Hi!

592
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,555
Does everyone know some sports?

593
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,554
A little about golf.

594
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,552
But I didn't go further.

595
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:08,550
Usually there will be some activities
when propagandizing.

596
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,546
Need to face those journalists.

597
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,539
Is it good?

598
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,537
Yes.

599
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:26,533
I apologize for all the things last night.

600
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,532
Last night?

601
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:30,530
I had forgotten about it. Don't mention it.

602
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,528
Sorry.

603
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,525
I'm not apologize for my personal thinking.

604
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:36,524
I'm still thinking.

605
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:37,524
No one feel interesting. Stop it.

606
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:40,521
Everybody has their dinner quietly.
Forget it!

607
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:42,519
Nothing happened. Everything is all right.

608
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,517
And everyone likes your film so much

609
00:37:44,517 --> 00:37:46,515
I am one of them.

610
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,514
Maybe just a little.

611
00:37:49,513 --> 00:37:53,509
You like it for a little.
I prefer you don't.

612
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:58,505
I think you don't in your heart. Really.

613
00:37:58,505 --> 00:37:59,504
Probably.

614
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:01,582
Listen, it's wrong either for
him to say these were nothing.

615
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:02,581
He acted rashly.

616
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,579
Julien, forget it!

617
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:08,575
No, I can't!

618
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,571
Only one sentence before it's all over.

619
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:17,567
It's what a fool do.

620
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,566
That's the point.
We must choose to be fool.

621
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:22,563
Why do you say that?

622
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:26,559
For example, for me,

623
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,557
You are one of my enemies.

624
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,556
You know, Julien,
there is real war now.

625
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:31,555
Some people are suffering.

626
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:32,554
I know.

627
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:33,553
I'm not saying this.

628
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:36,550
I only say to you what I want to.

629
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,549
Without any hostility.

630
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,548
Listen,Julien,

631
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:39,547
Your mother is angry.

632
00:38:39,547 --> 00:38:41,546
You can't make others like this.

633
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:42,545
Go and hide. Wait!

634
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:43,544
We don't want to see you.
Let's make it.

635
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:46,541
I have the right to say what I want to say.

636
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,539
I don't stay here for myself.

637
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:49,538
I want nothing.

638
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,538
You are right.

639
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:53,535
I'd like to know that I am your enemy.

640
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:54,534
Why?

641
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,532
Did I threaten you?

642
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,530
You are a threat to me.

643
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,608
Am I?

644
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,608
Yes,the movie you made.

645
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:04,605
Julien,you can't say that.

646
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:06,603
What? What can't I say?

647
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:07,602
We can say anything.

648
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:08,601
Sticking at your own thoughts in life

649
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:09,600
It's important.

650
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,599
You are right.

651
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,597
What's my movie to you.

652
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:15,595
You can laugh at me with my mother.

653
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:17,593
First, I won't laugh at you

654
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:20,590
Second,I think I said I like your movie.

655
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,589
I think you didn't hear that.

656
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,587
Yes,I like it very much.

657
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,585
You say that with commanding tone?

658
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:28,583
Like those masters?

659
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,580
But I don't like you.

660
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,577
Then what I've done may be ridiculous,
coarse and childish.

661
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,573
But it's costful.

662
00:39:39,573 --> 00:39:41,571
Belief comes from the fountain.

663
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:42,571
I agree.

664
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,570
No,you don't.

665
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,569
Because,if you would like to,

666
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:47,566
In last movie you made with my mother,

667
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:48,565
<Doble>,the movie you made with her.

668
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:49,564
You called it <Doble>,right?

669
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:50,563
Yes,<Doble>

670
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:52,562
Okay,I'm telling you why I don't like it.

671
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:53,561
Shut up.

672
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,559
No,wait,let him talk.

673
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,558
I want to hear it.

674
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,556
The people live in same mode.

675
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:02,552
The descriptions of those peoeple
are overdone.

676
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:05,550
The figures are too imaginary.

677
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,547
They don't exist,it's a shadowland.

678
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:10,545
That's all nosense.

679
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:12,543
Only exist for the actors,

680
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,541
let them be the stars in the world.

681
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,539
But what have we seen?

682
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,538
Nothing.

683
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:20,536
We've only seen the actors were working.

684
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:22,534
Nothing with the real life.

685
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,533
Please leave the table,it's my house.

686
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,532
It's my house too,it's dad's house.

687
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:27,530
Why I can't say what I want to say?

688
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,528
You are sick of everyone.

689
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:31,526
Haven't you lived enough as an stranger?

690
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:33,525
Aren't you sick of yourself?

691
00:40:33,525 --> 00:40:36,522
It's weird,you all say the samething here.

692
00:40:36,522 --> 00:40:40,518
Let's go when they are talking.

693
00:40:41,517 --> 00:40:44,515
Your words are a big shock.

694
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:48,511
I feel that you judge people
by their habbits

695
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:50,509
Like in the court.

696
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:51,508
Those of your thoughts.

697
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,506
Film is a material stuff,
very meterial.

698
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:55,505
It's you.

699
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,503
Star,payment,budget

700
00:40:57,503 --> 00:41:00,580
Julien,it costs much money
to make money now.

701
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,578
We have to make a compromise of money.

702
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:05,576
And,the result will be like you.

703
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:08,573
You stay at home,write some poems.

704
00:41:08,573 --> 00:41:09,572
Yeah,it's still a life.

705
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:11,570
Julien,don't say it.

706
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,568
You can't offend people like this.

707
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:15,567
Wait,Lili.

708
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:17,565
Anyway,what he said is right.

709
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:18,564
What do I call it?

710
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:19,563
I can't speak clearly at this moment.

711
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:22,560
You should know,once,
you were as unsophisticated as me.

712
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,558
But I'll never be like you.

713
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:25,557
It's enough. Julien.

714
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,557
I don't believes the thoughts of genius.

715
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,556
I believe energy

716
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:30,553
I believe impulsion and desire.

717
00:41:30,553 --> 00:41:31,552
Good,you are animals

718
00:41:31,552 --> 00:41:33,550
Sometimes.

719
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,549
Listen,Julien

720
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:36,548
There is something beautiful,
just like Van Roost said.

721
00:41:36,548 --> 00:41:39,545
When he talked about fun,
he was like that's a beast.

722
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:43,541
original impulsion and pleasure

723
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,538
The enthusiasm of enjoying body.

724
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,535
Even remember some trivial pleasure

725
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:54,531
He talked about a girl lost her virginity

726
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,528
He said,when enjoying
the corporeally pleasure

727
00:41:58,528 --> 00:42:02,604
He felt that he could make
her mother's spirit cry

728
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,602
The spirit of angel

729
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:08,599
makes the spirit of god cry for it.

730
00:42:09,598 --> 00:42:11,596
It's so beautiful.

731
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:14,593
That's how you think.

732
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:18,590
You are very exited.

733
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:22,612
Are you a little sad?

734
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,610
A little.

735
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,607
Can I have a look at what you wrote?

736
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:29,605
No.

737
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:33,602
Then I'll take a peek at it.

738
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:35,600
That's not easy.
I always carry it with me.

739
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,598
Lili

740
00:43:40,595 --> 00:43:44,592
Let me have a peek at your diary,
I'll keep the secret

741
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:48,588
Lili,come here,I'm talking to you.

742
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:51,586
I don't wanna go.

743
00:43:52,585 --> 00:43:55,582
I'm good here.

744
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:59,578
Come here,please.

745
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:18,641
You are not sleeping,aren't you?

746
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:20,639
No.

747
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:45,617
Lili.

748
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,615
What?

749
00:44:47,615 --> 00:44:48,614
What's wrong with you?

750
00:44:48,614 --> 00:44:49,613
Nothing

751
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:51,611
It's you who's weird

752
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:00,683
I've lost the all.

753
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:04,680
What have you lost?

754
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,678
Movie,play,everything.

755
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:08,676
You are so stupid.

756
00:45:08,676 --> 00:45:10,674
It's the end.

757
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,672
Why are you so cold?

758
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:15,670
Why don't you care about it at all?

759
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,669
I don't understand the whole thing.

760
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:17,668
It's just like there's a deep
hole in my head

761
00:45:17,668 --> 00:45:19,666
Why couldn't you just be more simple?

762
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,665
Life is more simple than that,isn't it?

763
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:22,663
What's simple?

764
00:45:22,663 --> 00:45:23,662
Last night,you were with
them until very late.

765
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:24,661
You didn't even come to see me.

766
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:26,660
You don't care.

767
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,658
Is it simple?

768
00:45:30,656 --> 00:45:34,652
What makes you become like this?

769
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:37,650
You fall in love with that stupid guy?

770
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:38,649
You love him?

771
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:40,647
I don't love anyone,let me go

772
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:41,646
Lili.

773
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:45,642
Don't go,Lili,please.

774
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,640
Lili,I can hardly recognize you.

775
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,639
What's wrong with you?

776
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,637
You are too stupid.

777
00:45:52,636 --> 00:45:56,633
The yesterday's and today's
you are very funny in my eyes.

778
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,709
I'm funny?

779
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:01,708
Don't talk to me.

780
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,707
I can hardly think.

781
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:04,705
Think of what?

782
00:46:05,704 --> 00:46:09,701
It's enough,you suddenly
walk to the other side

783
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,696
Who were you with?

784
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,694
With whom?

785
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,692
Myself.

786
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:24,687
And I've never said I love you.

787
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,681
I thought our relationship
was not gonna change.

788
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:34,678
It can't disappear just like this.

789
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:38,675
It's the thing that protects us.

790
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:40,673
Lili.

791
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,666
Don't do this,no.

792
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:44,615
I'm going out for a while.

793
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:45,614
Say goodbye to Mado and Simon

794
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,612
Bye.

795
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,608
Serge,be careful.

796
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,606
Serge,I wish we could leave together.

797
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:57,603
You take me to somewhere far away.

798
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:58,602
I can't stand any more, Serge

799
00:47:58,602 --> 00:47:59,601
Don't do this,please don't.

800
00:47:59,601 --> 00:48:01,600
Then what do you want?

801
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,599
Don't do this.

802
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:03,598
We can't just go away.

803
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:07,594
You are not a little girl anymore.

804
00:48:43,562 --> 00:48:45,560
Are you okay?

805
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:48,557
You don't look like ...

806
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:52,554
Don't you want to have a walk?

807
00:48:59,547 --> 00:49:03,584
I'm tired.Because I feel I'm old.

808
00:49:03,584 --> 00:49:05,582
You?

809
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:10,577
I don't think so.I feel
like I have dignity.

810
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:18,570
I'll have to join a party
in Paris tomorrow.

811
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,566
An Film Award.

812
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:27,562
I'll go with Brice.

813
00:49:27,562 --> 00:49:28,561
I want to go too.

814
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:30,559
No,you don't.Simon.

815
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,557
I've to go,you stay here.

816
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:34,556
you don't like Paris.

817
00:49:34,556 --> 00:49:37,553
You always say that.

818
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:39,551
You won't be alone.

819
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,549
Julien,Jeanne-Marie will be with you.

820
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,548
And that kid,Lili

821
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,547
Don't complain.

822
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:48,543
What could you do at Paris?

823
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,541
You can only wander here and there.

824
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,539
It's true, though.

825
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:55,537
Then you stay here with Julien.

826
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,535
Please take care of him.

827
00:49:57,535 --> 00:50:00,532
I'm afraid of him.

828
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:04,529
He treat his mother as...
I even don't know what to do.

829
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:06,527
I love this kid.

830
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:07,526
It isn't the problem.

831
00:50:07,526 --> 00:50:08,525
I love him, too.

832
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:09,524
He's my son.

833
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:10,523
I mean I don't know him very much.

834
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:12,521
But he is reasonable to the life.

835
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:13,520
Why reasonable?

836
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Of course.

837
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,518
A proud kid he is, though.

838
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:18,516
He's very acuminous.

839
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,514
Neither a favourite son, nor a skunk.

840
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:22,512
He has the viability.

841
00:50:22,512 --> 00:50:23,511
What are you saying!

842
00:50:23,511 --> 00:50:25,510
So boring you are!

843
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:27,508
Okey, it's enough.

844
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,506
He's a futilitarian, but not tragical.

845
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:30,505
You are a futilitarian, too.

846
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:34,501
Well, I may go to the toilet.

847
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:39,497
I want to have a life like yours.

848
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:41,495
It's reasonable.

849
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:44,492
You have a wonderful life.

850
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:47,490
You see, some excellent people.

851
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,487
Yes, it's excellent.

852
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,485
What a genius you are, Lili!

853
00:50:52,485 --> 00:50:55,483
It's because you have a success life,
but you care nothing for it.

854
00:50:55,483 --> 00:50:59,479
Obviously, your life is deep-seated.

855
00:51:02,556 --> 00:51:03,555
You LIVE indeed.

856
00:51:03,555 --> 00:51:07,552
It's important that you share
the cheer with others.

857
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:10,549
If I were you,

858
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:13,546
I would devote my myself to the public.

859
00:51:13,546 --> 00:51:17,543
You are right, I'm devoting my mind
to the cinema and audience.

860
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,538
Lili, do you know that people like
packman like tobacco pack.

861
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:25,535
They would think of you when they want.

862
00:51:25,535 --> 00:51:27,534
If we think a lot of something,
we couldn't respect the audience.

863
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:28,533
How the level it is!

864
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,530
What's the meaning?

865
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:35,526
It means you would lost your own opinion.

866
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,506
That's my mother's house opposite.

867
00:51:57,506 --> 00:52:00,584
I have the very same experience with Julien.

868
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:04,580
His father is dead, and my mother, too.

869
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,577
Both we grow up like this.

870
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:08,576
I live through my childhood here.

871
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:10,575
I kept all in my mind.

872
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:14,571
The sea, and the island there.

873
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:17,568
They're good materials of a movie.

874
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:19,567
Really?

875
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:21,565
About some fairy tale.

876
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:27,559
There's an unsophisticated girl.

877
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:30,557
She lives beside the sea.

878
00:52:30,557 --> 00:52:32,555
Free, and happy.

879
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,553
One day,

880
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,549
A man came to her.

881
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:42,546
He made she felf very happy.

882
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,598
I...

883
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,591
I will devote myself to the happiness.

884
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:24,588
Love you, make films, these're happiness.

885
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:31,581
I'm stupid.

886
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:18,619
Let's leave tonight.

887
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:20,617
We together.

888
00:55:32,632 --> 00:55:36,628
Don't look for it anymore,
it's here in my hand.

889
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:45,620
What did you write?

890
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,619
Nothing.

891
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,616
Something interest me.

892
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:53,613
Did you see them? Or just coin them?

893
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:56,610
I saw , I heard.

894
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,608
Did you record them?

895
00:55:59,608 --> 00:56:01,686
Of course.

896
00:56:02,685 --> 00:56:04,683
About something happened here.

897
00:56:04,683 --> 00:56:08,680
What people did and said.

898
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,677
Yes, a lot of them.

899
00:56:11,677 --> 00:56:14,674
But nothing special.

900
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:16,672
They would occur anywhere, anytime.

901
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:17,671
Do you thing so?

902
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:18,671
You are right.

903
00:56:18,671 --> 00:56:19,670
Want some?

904
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,668
No, thanks.

905
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,665
Are you open-eyed?

906
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,661
I know many girls like drink.

907
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:30,660
The same as man.

908
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,657
I don't like the alcohol itself.

909
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:37,653
But the fettle after drink.

910
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:41,650
They are all there, not mine.

911
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,647
What are you writng?

912
00:56:44,647 --> 00:56:45,646
What you said just now.

913
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:48,643
Anything can happen at any time.

914
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:49,643
Is it funny?

915
00:56:49,643 --> 00:56:53,639
Yeah,I write it for the audience

916
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:56,636
You should know it.I can write it for you.

917
00:56:56,636 --> 00:56:59,633
You think you are not watching,
but actually you are.

918
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:01,712
I'm watching.

919
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,707
In the movies,those great moments
are always unforgetable.

920
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:07,706
Those who sacrificed

921
00:57:07,706 --> 00:57:11,703
People are looking for the mystic things
for their life times.

922
00:57:12,702 --> 00:57:16,698
During the life time,one should learn how
to keep itself,not to go after fashion

923
00:57:16,698 --> 00:57:17,697
Ok,write this down too.

924
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:21,694
one should learn how to keep itself,
not to go after fashion

925
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:26,689
Life should be more unambitious

926
00:57:26,689 --> 00:57:30,685
Looking for some thing equable.
Somthing insignificant.

927
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:34,682
The waiting is useless,do not wait any more

928
00:57:34,682 --> 00:57:36,680
I'm eager to live with some normal persons.

929
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,677
My trouble is very simple.

930
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:42,675
Not too much worry and joy,just like this.

931
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:44,673
I make you sick.

932
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:45,672
This is what I need.

933
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,670
I want you to be sick of me.

934
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,667
You are beautiful,Marie.
You are very beautiful.

935
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,665
I don't know if you know it,
but you are very pretty.

936
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:57,661
Though Julien dosn't like you.

937
00:57:57,661 --> 00:57:59,659
You are the most interesting people here.

938
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:01,737
I don't care if I'm intertesting.

939
00:58:01,737 --> 00:58:04,735
I want to be happy.

940
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:08,731
Then you shouldn't be here.

941
00:58:10,729 --> 00:58:14,726
Shouldn't be here,Jeanne-Marie

942
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:21,719
You can go with Lili

943
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,692
Did mom go away?

944
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:54,690
No.

945
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:58,686
Brice and Lili went away together.

946
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:03,761
Are you okay?

947
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,760
Yeah.

948
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,758
I know.

949
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:12,753
I knew it.

950
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:27,740
Be careful,it's hot.

951
00:59:29,738 --> 00:59:32,735
Where is mom?

952
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,732
Will she come to dinner soon?

953
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:39,729
Dinner begins in half an hour,if you want.

954
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:51,664
Serge went away,didn't left me his equipment

955
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:05,731
You take this basket.

956
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:11,726
I wanna go to the station at 8.
It's not early now.

957
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:17,720
Julien,wait.

958
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,719
When I saw them go,I wanted to tell you.

959
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,718
I looked for you.

960
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:23,715
'Cause I think you may want to speak with Lili.

961
01:01:23,715 --> 01:01:27,711
I was looking for you everywhere,
but couldn't find you.

962
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:31,708
It's okay. Jeanne,thanks.

963
01:02:05,757 --> 01:02:07,755
Mom

964
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:24,740
Mom.

965
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:27,737
Who's there?

966
01:02:28,736 --> 01:02:30,734
Me.

967
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:35,730
What's going on?

968
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:44,722
What's the time now?

969
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:52,714
I'll have to get up in 3 hours.

970
01:02:52,714 --> 01:02:55,712
Let me sleep for a while.  Go ahead.

971
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:57,710
Please.

972
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:08,780
I feel sick.

973
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,778
I'm scared.

974
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:13,775
Of what?

975
01:03:13,775 --> 01:03:14,775
I don't know.

976
01:03:14,775 --> 01:03:18,771
I'm scared to be alone.

977
01:03:20,769 --> 01:03:22,767
Be alone.

978
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:28,762
We are both unlucky.

979
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,758
Come here,don't cry.

980
01:03:38,753 --> 01:03:42,749
Sleep with me.

981
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:56,737
Do you still remember we used
to sleep together?

982
01:03:56,737 --> 01:03:58,735
How was that?

983
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:02,731
You slept very well at that time.

984
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:04,729
Yeah.

985
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:13,721
I'm thirsty

986
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:15,719
Aren't you?

987
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,715
I'm gonna drink that bottle of water.

988
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:21,714
I'm getting up.

989
01:04:21,714 --> 01:04:25,710
It's too hot here.

990
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,677
Look.

991
01:05:05,674 --> 01:05:09,671
Let go,let go,let go.

992
01:05:38,645 --> 01:05:39,644
No.

993
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,642
I've already made some programs
that make people dizzy.

994
01:05:41,642 --> 01:05:43,640
Do you still wanna talk?

995
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,637
I have nothing to do.
Do you still wanna talk?

996
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:49,635
Be careful,he always borrows money from me.

997
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:50,634
I won't do that.

998
01:05:50,634 --> 01:05:54,630
I don't like those journalists

999
01:05:55,629 --> 01:05:57,627
Patrick doesn't know what he's gonna do either?

1000
01:05:57,627 --> 01:05:58,626
He doesn't want to go anywhere.

1001
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:01,664
He have to talk something about acting.

1002
01:06:01,664 --> 01:06:05,660
I know it's important.

1003
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,657
But agreement is more important to me.

1004
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:12,654
I'm fine,I don't need to shoot some bad films.

1005
01:06:12,654 --> 01:06:14,652
They don't spend money in propagand at all.

1006
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:17,649
Wait,do you think it's enough?

1007
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:21,646
Paste some posts in the cinemas

1008
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:23,644
No,you ...

1009
01:06:25,642 --> 01:06:29,638
No,you are too exaggerated.

1010
01:06:30,638 --> 01:06:31,637
You can go to watch that program.

1011
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:35,633
Bring me a sandwich,
I need to have some strength back.

1012
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:37,631
Sure,nothing else?

1013
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,630
A big one.

1014
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:39,629
Okay.

1015
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:40,629
Julie

1016
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:41,628
I have to talk to you.

1017
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:44,625
Okay,you guys come here.

1018
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:48,621
Okay,emily

1019
01:06:52,618 --> 01:06:54,616
Ah,Lili.

1020
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,611
Hi.

1021
01:06:59,611 --> 01:07:01,690
Hi

1022
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:07,684
Let's kiss,like in those movies.

1023
01:07:07,684 --> 01:07:10,681
Like they do in the movies.

1024
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:12,680
Lili,how are you doing these days?

1025
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,679
I'm fine.I'm going to make a
propagandistic program now.

1026
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:14,678
On French Station 2.

1027
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:16,676
How about you? Is everything okay?

1028
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:20,672
We are good.Just like this.

1029
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,669
Do you walk this way?

1030
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:26,667
Yes,I'm going to Makinpot,are you?

1031
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:27,666
Makinpot?

1032
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:29,664
Someone invite us to have dinner
in a restaurant there.

1033
01:07:29,664 --> 01:07:31,662
We'll visit those historic buildings there.

1034
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:32,662
Okay.

1035
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:34,660
We are very good now,
planning to shoot my next film.

1036
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,659
Our.

1037
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:37,657
Ah,our next film,sorry,honey.

1038
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:40,654
We are both producer now,
especially Mado

1039
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:44,651
Sorry,I've to answer a call.

1040
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:45,650
How's Julien?

1041
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,648
He's fine.

1042
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:51,644
He wanted to put yo uin the first place,
but because you...

1043
01:07:51,644 --> 01:07:53,643
Why didn't you ever call him?

1044
01:07:53,643 --> 01:07:54,642
I don't dare

1045
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:56,640
I saw he entered the hospital that day.

1046
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,638
I was very scared,I missed the train.

1047
01:07:58,638 --> 01:08:00,716
I didn't have enough courage.

1048
01:08:00,716 --> 01:08:03,713
Um,listen,it's all over now.

1049
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,712
It has... how to say it?
Time limitation, is it?

1050
01:08:05,712 --> 01:08:07,710
How is his life now?

1051
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:10,707
It's okay,everything is over.

1052
01:08:10,707 --> 01:08:14,704
It's been 2 years,hasn't it?

1053
01:08:14,704 --> 01:08:17,701
I can't remember,I can't remember the date.

1054
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:20,698
I haven't seen him for 4 years.

1055
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:23,695
I have to say,he lived well,
he even started to write plays.

1056
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:24,695
Is it a short play?

1057
01:08:24,695 --> 01:08:28,691
No,it was his first feature one, on tv.

1058
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:31,688
Julien is going to shoot his first movie too.

1059
01:08:31,688 --> 01:08:32,687
It's just like a dream.

1060
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:33,686
Are you talking about Julien's movie?

1061
01:08:33,686 --> 01:08:34,685
Yes.

1062
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:36,684
It's not bad,really.

1063
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:38,682
Great,what's it about?

1064
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,680
About something we've been through.

1065
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,676
But he refused those professional actors.

1066
01:08:44,676 --> 01:08:46,675
So you will act in the movie?

1067
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:50,671
Yes,we act as ourself in the movie.

1068
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:54,667
He also persuaded Brice to act a role.

1069
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:55,667
Oh?

1070
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,665
Actually I was very tense.

1071
01:08:57,665 --> 01:09:01,741
Director and actor are so different.

1072
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,738
What do you shoot in the movie,
in details?

1073
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:06,737
We can't tell you yet.

1074
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:10,733
Of course we can.It's a big family,
everyone has his own problem

1075
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:14,729
Actually it's the real life in pain.

1076
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:16,727
Sure. I don't know either.

1077
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:19,725
Anyway,it's our real lives.

1078
01:09:19,725 --> 01:09:22,722
I don't even know what I will be like.

1079
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:24,720
But,i'll act.

1080
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,717
I'll act when he ask me to.

1081
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:29,716
If it's our lives,

1082
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:33,712
what should I do in it?

1083
01:09:34,711 --> 01:09:36,709
Ah,I don't know. Lili.

1084
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:39,707
I talked to Julien,he just shaked his head.

1085
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:42,704
Ah,Emily,you are here.

1086
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:43,703
Hi,Mado.

1087
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:45,701
Hi,Brice. How are you?

1088
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:47,700
Fine. Goodbye.

1089
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:49,698
Sorry,we have to go.

1090
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:51,696
Wait,goodbye.

1091
01:09:51,696 --> 01:09:52,695
Bye.

1092
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:55,692
Bye,Mado.

1093
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,691
Let's go.

1094
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:58,690
Bye.

1095
01:10:06,682 --> 01:10:08,681
Let's go faster.

1096
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:10,679
Wait,I'll have a call.

1097
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:14,675
I'll be right back.

1098
01:10:16,673 --> 01:10:18,672
It's me again.

1099
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,670
No,i've to go to the studio.

1100
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:21,669
I don't call you for this.

1101
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:25,665
Can you look for a movie that's
gonna be shot for me?

1102
01:10:25,665 --> 01:10:28,662
The first movie by Julien Marceaux.

1103
01:10:28,662 --> 01:10:32,659
Director Brice and Madeleine
will have roles in it.

1104
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:35,656
Yes,he has a role,don't ask me abou this.

1105
01:10:35,656 --> 01:10:39,653
Can you ask if he find the actress
for that girl's role?

1106
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:41,651
Okay.

1107
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:45,647
Will you call me again?

1108
01:10:45,647 --> 01:10:47,645
I will,bye.

1109
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:05,709
I thought you wouldn't come.

1110
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:10,705
No,you saw it.

1111
01:11:11,704 --> 01:11:12,703
Good evening.

1112
01:11:12,703 --> 01:11:14,701
Good evening.

1113
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:19,696
Take this.

1114
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:21,695
Thanks.

1115
01:11:24,692 --> 01:11:26,690
Is it good?

1116
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:31,686
You'll know it after seeing it.

1117
01:11:32,685 --> 01:11:34,683
The topic is interesting.

1118
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:36,681
Not at all.

1119
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:45,673
You can sit for a while.

1120
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:51,667
I feel you grow up.

1121
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:54,665
Of course it's impossible for you
to not grow up.

1122
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:58,661
I think you became a star when you was 25

1123
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,739
I saw the house is ostentatious
when I was outside just now.

1124
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:01,738
It's your house,isn't it?

1125
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:02,737
Yes,it's large.

1126
01:12:02,737 --> 01:12:04,736
But not in my house,it's my friend's

1127
01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:05,735
He's in London now.

1128
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:07,733
Come here.

1129
01:12:26,716 --> 01:12:30,712
Have somehting.

1130
01:13:41,728 --> 01:13:43,726
Good evening.

1131
01:14:25,768 --> 01:14:29,765
I feel so good to call you.

1132
01:14:31,763 --> 01:14:33,761
How's Marie?

1133
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:36,758
What? She didn't sleep yet?

1134
01:14:36,758 --> 01:14:40,755
Okay,let her speak with me.

1135
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:43,752
Hey,baby.

1136
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:44,751
How about you?

1137
01:14:44,751 --> 01:14:48,747
I'm not very happy.You can hear my tone.

1138
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:51,745
Me neither.I wanna talk with you,
but I have to sleep.

1139
01:14:51,745 --> 01:14:55,741
Or you'll be tired.

1140
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,738
Of course I'll miss you every minute.

1141
01:14:58,738 --> 01:14:59,738
Give you a big kiss.

1142
01:14:59,738 --> 01:15:01,816
Pass the phone to mommy.

1143
01:15:01,816 --> 01:15:03,814
Okay.

1144
01:15:05,812 --> 01:15:08,809
Yes. I've to go.

1145
01:15:08,809 --> 01:15:12,806
I shouldn't come here.

1146
01:15:12,806 --> 01:15:15,803
Because...I'll tell you at the right time.

1147
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:19,799
I miss you two so much.

1148
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:21,798
Kiss you.

1149
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:23,796
Bye.

1150
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,789
I thought you went away already.

1151
01:15:31,789 --> 01:15:33,787
How were you talking to?

1152
01:15:33,787 --> 01:15:35,785
Jeanne-Marie

1153
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,781
We have a daughter.

1154
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:41,780
Marie

1155
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:43,778
It's so interesting.

1156
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:46,775
How old is your daughter.

1157
01:15:58,764 --> 01:16:01,841
Do you live well here?

1158
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:05,838
I feel like to do anything here.

1159
01:16:05,838 --> 01:16:07,836
Good life.

1160
01:16:07,836 --> 01:16:10,833
The scenes I watched on tv are unimaginable.

1161
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,832
Just like a dream

1162
01:16:12,832 --> 01:16:13,831
I hardly have time to be here.

1163
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:17,827
I'm shooting the movie at the most time

1164
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:19,825
Sorry

1165
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,816
Mado said you started to shoot your movie.

1166
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:31,814
Yes.

1167
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:34,812
It's great.You can do what you like to do.

1168
01:16:34,812 --> 01:16:38,808
Yes.I did it.

1169
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:41,805
I've read your play <Disappear>

1170
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,802
What?You've read it?

1171
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:49,798
I think it's not complicated.Not bad.

1172
01:16:49,798 --> 01:16:51,796
I didn't know you would read it.

1173
01:16:51,796 --> 01:16:53,794
Because it's not a good play.

1174
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:54,794
I wrote it with Jeanne-Marie.

1175
01:16:54,794 --> 01:16:58,790
We did it only for some money.

1176
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:01,867
Jeanne-Marie worked with you?

1177
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,865
She picked the actors with me.

1178
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:05,864
She did some other things

1179
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,862
She controled you.

1180
01:17:11,858 --> 01:17:13,856
Who will act my role?

1181
01:17:13,856 --> 01:17:15,855
That's not your role.

1182
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:17,853
You can't say it.

1183
01:17:17,853 --> 01:17:18,852
I still have the right to know it,don't I?

1184
01:17:18,852 --> 01:17:21,849
Your movie is about the things
we've been throught,it's about our experience.

1185
01:17:21,849 --> 01:17:25,846
Exactly,it's about something
we haven't been though.

1186
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:27,844
Who on earth will play my role?

1187
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:28,843
That's my role,that's me.

1188
01:17:28,843 --> 01:17:30,841
I know.

1189
01:17:30,841 --> 01:17:32,839
There are serveral possiblities,
I'm still trying.

1190
01:17:32,839 --> 01:17:34,837
Have you ever thought to give
this role to me?

1191
01:17:34,837 --> 01:17:36,836
No.

1192
01:17:37,835 --> 01:17:40,832
Why do you ask this?

1193
01:17:40,832 --> 01:17:42,830
I'd better be more careful.

1194
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:44,828
Be careful of what?

1195
01:17:47,826 --> 01:17:50,823
You should know the movie will 
e easier to shoot without you.

1196
01:17:50,823 --> 01:17:54,819
If so,you are too cruel.
You are pretending.

1197
01:17:55,818 --> 01:17:59,815
I think it's strange for you to come see me,
don't pretend.

1198
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:03,891
I'm not pretending.

1199
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,887
Is it something that you come to see me?

1200
01:18:10,885 --> 01:18:11,884
To me,it's just like your putting
your hands in my heart.

1201
01:18:11,884 --> 01:18:14,881
And hug each other,like this.

1202
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:16,879
I knew it was not gonna happen.

1203
01:18:16,879 --> 01:18:20,876
Why do you come if you knew it.

1204
01:18:25,871 --> 01:18:29,868
That's okay. We won't meet again. Bye.

1205
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,918
Julien.

1206
01:19:02,918 --> 01:19:04,916
Julien,is that you?

1207
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:06,914
Yes.

1208
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:10,911
Lili is calling for you.
She's not good at all now.

1209
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,908
Come.

1210
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:15,906
Let go of me.

1211
01:19:18,903 --> 01:19:20,902
Let go.

1212
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:30,893
Do you want some coffee?

1213
01:19:30,893 --> 01:19:32,891
I make some coffee for you.

1214
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:36,887
It's not in my house.

1215
01:19:41,883 --> 01:19:43,881
Are you okay?

1216
01:19:46,878 --> 01:19:49,875
I miss you very much,always.

1217
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:51,874
I miss you very much.

1218
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:55,870
I wanted to call you.

1219
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:59,866
I went to the hospital to see you.
But you were sleeping.

1220
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,862
Come.

1221
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,849
If you knew...

1222
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:22,846
If you knew I was lonely with Brice.

1223
01:20:25,843 --> 01:20:29,839
Do you know what he wrote in his notebook?

1224
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:33,836
That day when we kissed,

1225
01:20:33,836 --> 01:20:37,832
Do you know what he wrote down?

1226
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,830
He wrote.

1227
01:20:40,829 --> 01:20:43,827
When he kissed me,

1228
01:20:43,827 --> 01:20:47,823
he made my life became unlucky.

1229
01:20:49,821 --> 01:20:50,820
He wrote,

1230
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,817
he suddenly felt it would be a kind
of unlucky experience.

1231
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:58,813
Do you know it?

1232
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:02,809
Julien.

1233
01:21:06,806 --> 01:21:07,805
Julien.

1234
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:11,801
I'm here.

1235
01:21:32,782 --> 01:21:34,781
I know,

1236
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:40,775
I know our meeting together is like
a dream to me.

1237
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:45,771
I still wish we could meet again
in the movie.

1238
01:21:45,771 --> 01:21:49,767
Please.I wish so.

1239
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:52,764
Or you'll feel empty too.

1240
01:21:52,764 --> 01:21:55,762
You can't give my role to others.

1241
01:21:55,762 --> 01:21:56,761
It's impossible.

1242
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:58,759
Please,Julien.

1243
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:00,757
Please.

1244
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:18,752
Is it okay?

1245
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:20,751
It's okay.

1246
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:02,818
Just like your putting your hands
in my heart.

1247
01:26:02,818 --> 01:26:04,817
Then we hug,

1248
01:26:04,817 --> 01:26:06,815
just like this.

1249
01:26:09,812 --> 01:26:11,810
Sorry.

1250
01:26:16,806 --> 01:26:17,805
Mom.

1251
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:18,804
Shhhh.

1252
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:19,803
Baby.

1253
01:26:19,803 --> 01:26:20,802
I don't want to shoot the movie.

1254
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:22,800
No,it's being remade

1255
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,799
Galanty show?

1256
01:26:23,799 --> 01:26:24,799
Yes

1257
01:26:24,799 --> 01:26:26,797
Are you okay?How is your back?

1258
01:26:26,797 --> 01:26:28,795
Hi

1259
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:42,782
Up there.

1260
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,778
It's so cold.

1261
01:26:47,778 --> 01:26:49,776
There's nothing to eat here.

1262
01:26:49,776 --> 01:26:50,775
Is that true?

1263
01:26:50,775 --> 01:26:51,774
Yes.

1264
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:52,773
Michelle,

1265
01:26:52,773 --> 01:26:53,772
yeah,

1266
01:26:53,772 --> 01:26:57,769
let me introduce a person to you.

1267
01:26:57,769 --> 01:26:58,768
Ah,you are Simon.

1268
01:26:58,768 --> 01:27:00,846
Yes.

1269
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:02,844
It's nice to meet you.

1270
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:04,842
My pleasure.

1271
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:06,841
Don't say that.

1272
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,837
Ah,you act as me

1273
01:27:10,837 --> 01:27:12,835
What do you want me to write down?

1274
01:27:12,835 --> 01:27:15,832
After I kissed her,I was still me.

1275
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:16,832
But I took her into the endless pain.

1276
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:18,830
Okay.

1277
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:21,827
Hi.

1278
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:22,826
I hardly come.

1279
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:24,824
Not for the salary of course

1280
01:27:24,824 --> 01:27:25,823
Where is Mado?

1281
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:27,822
There.

1282
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:32,817
I wanna write the part of my own

1283
01:27:32,817 --> 01:27:34,815
After I kissed her,I was still me.
But I took her into

1284
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:38,812
Okay,I knew it.I knew.

1285
01:27:38,812 --> 01:27:40,810
Grandma.

1286
01:27:41,809 --> 01:27:43,807
You can't call me grandma,my angel.

1287
01:27:43,807 --> 01:27:44,806
Why?

1288
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:45,805
Grandma is shit.

1289
01:27:45,805 --> 01:27:47,804
No,not shit.

1290
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:48,803
Is your name Marie?

1291
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:50,801
Can you spell your name?

1292
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:51,800
I don't know

1293
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,799
Why don't you know?

1294
01:27:52,799 --> 01:27:54,797
Because mom's name is Jeanne-Marie.

1295
01:27:54,797 --> 01:27:56,795
But I'm her little garbage

1296
01:27:56,795 --> 01:27:59,793
No,you are a big garabge,very big.

1297
01:27:59,793 --> 01:28:03,869
Oh,yeah,you are a big one.

1298
01:28:05,867 --> 01:28:08,865
How are you gonna shoot?

1299
01:28:08,865 --> 01:28:10,863
Wait,of course.

1300
01:28:10,863 --> 01:28:14,859
Of course there can be some legends,
as meeting Brigitte Bardot.

1301
01:28:15,858 --> 01:28:19,855
You will say,it deson't matter,
you only want to write a novel

1302
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:20,854
There wouldn't be Bardot if no novel.

1303
01:28:20,854 --> 01:28:23,851
Yeah,I want to write some famous plays.

1304
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:27,847
So that my name will be used on a streen,
or a station.

1305
01:28:27,847 --> 01:28:31,844
When I was a kid,I always wanted
to pee while in the street.

1306
01:28:34,841 --> 01:28:36,839
I wanted to be a political person.

1307
01:28:36,839 --> 01:28:38,837
But I'm just a chicken now.

1308
01:28:38,837 --> 01:28:40,836
You should know,the name of my novel
is <My Chicken>

1309
01:28:40,836 --> 01:28:42,834
Actually you should act this role.

1310
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:43,833
You are so good at it.

1311
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:44,832
No.

1312
01:28:44,832 --> 01:28:45,831
You should take a part in the movie.

1313
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:49,828
Ah,my little castle. Come,come to me.

1314
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,824
Sorry ,we have to shoot.

1315
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,822
Can you get up please?

1316
01:28:55,822 --> 01:28:59,818
We have to use this chair.

1317
01:29:14,885 --> 01:29:17,882
Okay,green or black?

1318
01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:19,880
I like black.

1319
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,878
I can't make it,friend,
I need a special doctor.

1320
01:29:22,878 --> 01:29:26,874
I'm sick.Because I'm smart.

1321
01:29:26,874 --> 01:29:28,872
No,no,

1322
01:29:28,872 --> 01:29:29,871
You don't want to look after those
smart people.

1323
01:29:29,871 --> 01:29:33,868
Why do you become like this?

1324
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,865
I wanted to talk to you.

1325
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:37,864
All these.

1326
01:29:37,864 --> 01:29:39,862
I wanted to talk to you about
all these things.

1327
01:29:39,862 --> 01:29:41,861
No,I don't think so.

1328
01:29:41,861 --> 01:29:43,859
I don't like real representation.

1329
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:47,855
I don't believe people can have an agreement
in a same direction at all.

1330
01:29:47,855 --> 01:29:49,853
I think you are a mistake.

1331
01:29:49,853 --> 01:29:52,851
I think man will be lost.

1332
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:56,847
But belief is the reason I exist,
sometimes it is...

1333
01:29:57,846 --> 01:29:58,845
Oh

1334
01:29:58,845 --> 01:30:02,842
It comes after me again.

1335
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,836
You make me hurt,it's so annoying.

1336
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:20,825
Move it to there.

1337
01:30:35,812 --> 01:30:38,809
Start.Quiet.

1338
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:42,805
First scene in <Disppear> 110 scenes
