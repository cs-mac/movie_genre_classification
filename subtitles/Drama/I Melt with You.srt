1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,523
Man:
Words are tools.

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,362
You use the words
to create,

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,573
to create,

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,075
but that doesn't
necessarily mean to build.

5
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:39,997
It means sometimes
we use words

6
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,833
to chip away

7
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,002
at ourselves.

8
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,603
Reporter on TV: New data suggests
that global economic recovery

9
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,188
is weakening,

10
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,483
as there will be fraud charges
against six Wall Street...

11
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,318
- Woman: Ronnie?
- Yes, baby?

12
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,612
- Are you okay in there, hon?
- You know I am.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,447
- (laughs nervously)
- Are you sure?

14
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,698
Yeah.

15
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,283
Okay, I don't want you
to miss your flight.

16
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,659
I'm coming out
right now, baby.

17
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,912
- I would like that.
- Okay.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,623
Reporter: In Chicago,
both the NASDAQ and SMP

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,125
are thinking of territory
at the close today...

20
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,712
- Hello. How are you?
- I'm in pain.

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,967
So you...

22
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,637
you need something?

23
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,806
Yes...

24
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,975
I do.

25
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,609
Shh.

26
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,195
Please concentrate
on what you're doing.

27
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,282
Remember

28
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,618
your train of thought,
the flow of ideas

29
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,454
from your brain
down to your pencil,

30
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,999
onto the paper,

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,711
into your eyes,
back into your brain,

32
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,796
and around again.

33
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,666
Boom, boom!
Boom, boom!

34
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,752
- Daddy!
- Hi, Daddy.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,420
Team Princess!

36
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,049
Richard: A tingling sensation.
Is anyone paying attention?

37
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,806
- I'm proud of you.
- I wasn't scared.

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,975
I know.
I can see that.

39
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,268
(school bell rings)

40
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,938
Richard: Go enjoy your week
of freedom, people.

41
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,191
And remember, every time you crack
open that "Farewell to Arms,"

42
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,401
I have impinged upon
your freedom

43
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,279
and I am resolutely
not sorry.

44
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,198
- Dad, I need some money.
- Ron: Yes, yes.

45
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,367
Money, money, money.
Here we go.

46
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,122
Woman:
Miles!

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,250
Bye, Dad.

48
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,799
(speaking indistinctly)

49
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,556
- Bye. I love you guys.
- Girls: Bye.

50
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,433
I love you.

51
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,605
Timothy, this, my friend,
is your friend Richard.

52
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,732
We'll be celebrating
your birthday

53
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,651
on this holiday, yes?

54
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,445
See?
I did not forget you.

55
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,615
Big Sur, sir.
You have all the info.

56
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,201
Just look for the balloons
on the gate.

57
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,245
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

94
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,631
Richard?

95
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,969
Richard:
Who could that be?

96
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,721
I wonder.

97
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,975
First thing he does...
turn my fuckin' music down.

98
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,270
- Richard, come here.
- Uh-huh.

99
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,231
- Uh-huh!
- (both laughing)

100
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,816
Yes.

101
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,819
God, you don't age.

102
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,821
What is up with that?

103
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,158
What, have you got a painting of
yourself in an attic somewhere?

104
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,702
Come on,
what's the secret?

105
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,038
For old times' sake?
Huh? Huh?

106
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,666
Maybe a drink.
To start, anyway.

107
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,586
Love the car,
by the way.

108
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,671
Very you.

109
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,673
Yeah, I bought it
from some guy

110
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,175
on the way
from the airport.

111
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,803
You know, just saw the sign,
and, pow... impulse buy.

112
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,017
I intend to destroy it
in the next four days.

113
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,936
Some things
never change, Richard.

114
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,528
What is it?

115
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,822
Timmy?

116
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,201
Jill's.

117
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,204
I've been
wearing it again.

118
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,955
Five years ago
this month.

119
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,625
God, has it really been
that long? Jesus.

120
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,002
I'm so sorry.

121
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,839
Every time I see you,
you say those words,

122
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,383
and I always believe you.

123
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,802
And you never try
to tell me to forget.

124
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,767
But, per usual,

125
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,811
it is my job
to remind you

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,650
that this week is about
forgetting all that,

127
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,818
if only for the moment.

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,739
Hmm? Mm-hmm.

129
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,324
(sniffs)

130
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,867
Oh!

131
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,078
He lives.
He lives!

132
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,163
Look, you cannot
be cynical

133
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,249
and expect to have
any kind of success

134
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,084
in this world
or any other,

135
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,880
especially if you
claim to be an artist.

136
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,759
I'm tired... sick and tired
of cynical artists.

137
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,429
(cell phone rings)

138
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,725
Ronaldo's here.

139
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,353
Uh-oh, my liver
just had a heart attack.

140
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,730
Richard:
Hey, if you need anything else,

141
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,732
I'd be happy to pick it up
for you in the morning.

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,110
This is her.

143
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,530
God, so pretty.

144
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,908
- She's all grown up, Ron.
- It's crazy, huh?

145
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,078
Hey, um, is she
getting cock yet?

146
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,080
I pray for your soul,
Richard.

147
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,957
You cannot pray
for a soulless man.

148
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,750
Oh, yeah? Ronaldo,
let me ask you this.

149
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,002
Yeah.

150
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:51,798
When your 16-year-old daughter's
hot friends come by,

151
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,968
do you ever think about
what it might be like

152
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,471
to fuck 'em in the ass
till they're cross-eyed?

153
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,561
- I told you! See? See?
- Shut the fuck up.

154
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,479
- Pass the blow.
- Told you.

155
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,356
Jesus, some things
never change, huh?

156
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,650
Hey, hey, I merely say
what others think...

157
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,819
- Mm-hmm.
...but fear to say.

158
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,656
You want some, honey?
No, don't tell Mommy.

159
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,034
(all laugh)

160
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,369
(snorting)
Oh, my God, look at this.

161
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,414
It's the first time in the history of
Internet real estate photography

162
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,666
the place is as big
in real life

163
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,168
as it was online, huh?

164
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,711
It's beautiful, Ron.
Perfect.

165
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,588
Let me know when you
want to settle up.

166
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,923
Ron:
It's already settled.

167
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,343
The rich are different
from you and me, Timothy.

168
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,721
Thank you, Ron.

169
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,182
We've always
been different.

170
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,602
I love you.

171
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,520
Ron:
You're welcome, by the way.

172
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,856
(laughing)
Oh, thank you.

173
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,150
Thank you, thank you.

174
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,444
- Tim: I was there!
- Ron: You were not there.

175
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,987
- You weren't there.
- Of course I was there.

176
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,489
- I popped my head out...
- I'm the guy that gets busted.

177
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,990
- You get busted...
- I'm the guy.

178
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,409
I pop my head out...
'cause all I wanted...

179
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,911
- I ran off.
...to let you know,

180
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,245
'cause I was gonna
bail you out,

181
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,039
so I said,
"How much for bail?"

182
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,624
And he looks at me
and he goes, "That's him.

183
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,167
- That's him right there."
- "That's the guy!"

184
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,960
- Well, he was the guy.
- The cops fuckin' bust me, and...

185
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,879
You weren't there.
I don't remember...

186
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,048
- Of course I was there! I ran off.
- You weren't fuckin' there.

187
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,843
- No, you weren't there.
- (overlapping voices)

188
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,518
- The doctor is in!
- Hey, Doc.

189
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,561
- He certainly is.
- Richard: Yes!

190
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,023
- What and how much?
- Enough to treat the illnesses at hand.

191
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,651
- Welcome, my friend.
- My man, Ron!

192
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,948
Look at him.
He's beautiful.

193
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,575
Ron:
He can't afford a razor.

194
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,953
Someone get me a drink
while I urinate.

195
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,748
- All right.

So Amanda,
during her pregnancy,

202
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,364
is getting incredibly...

203
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,616
(clears throat)
Nauseous.

204
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,745
- And what do you think it was from?
- Do tell! I'm dying to know.

205
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,122
- It was me.
- Of course it was.

206
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,790
It was my scent.
No, seriously.

207
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,667
Four months
of her pregnancy,

208
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,212
I have to sleep
in the other room, okay?

209
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,007
But... but I have become
a professional masturbator.

210
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,301
- No, no, no...
- What the fuck is this shit?

211
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,802
What are we talking about?

212
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,637
I see you guys
once a fuckin' year.

213
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,724
- It's my life.
- Doc...

214
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,309
how's the world
of dating, pal?

215
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,853
- It is what it is.
- Oh, come on.

216
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,814
You sedate them, and then it's your
right and your privilege

217
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,441
to take what's
rightfully yours, correct?

218
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,151
- Oh, my God.
- Ron: I hope you're doing that.

219
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,153
Really.
Why don't you tell us about

220
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,991
what you told me about...
the 20-year-old woman?

221
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,035
Thanks, Richard.

222
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,787
Tim:
I don't think I can stay here for this.

223
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,372
- Come on.
- Amongst friends.

224
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
Tim:
I don't think I can stay here.

225
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,167
When you told me,
it just sounded like

226
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,795
you should fucking
get it off your chest, you know.

227
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,962
- I mean, you...
- Ron: What?

228
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,341
It was a one-time-only
thing.

229
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,928
And the girl came in
late in the day.

230
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,180
She was pretty,
to say the least,

231
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,809
and it had been
a while for me.

232
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,522
And I... used
anesthesia on her.

233
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,358
Yeah. Let's skip
to the part

234
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,860
where you sent
the receptionist home.

235
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,240
I did things.

236
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,075
I mean, I basically
lost control.

237
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,203
And looking back on it,

238
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,873
I really feel that
I shouldn't have...

239
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,836
- Oh, you fucker! Fuck you!

It was that girl Emily.

250
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,864
She lived in the house
next to us.

251
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,782
Yeah, yeah.
And who was the guy?

252
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,743
- It was Simon... Simon Tuller.
- No, no, no, it wasn't.

253
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,663
You know, I actually
fucked Emily, just... and who else?

254
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,248
- Guilty as charged.
- Tim: I didn't.

255
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,417
- She gave me crabs.
- Ron: She gave you the crabs?

256
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,336
I fucked her boyfriend
Jeff Snyder.

257
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,381
Ron:
Oh, great. Well played.

258
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,924
- That's so fucking funny...
- What?

259
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,260
...because when
I fucked Emily, I gave her crabs,

260
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,680
which basically means
I gave you the crabs!

261
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,099
- Hey, fuck off!
- (laughter)

262
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,895
I banged her...
when I banged her,

263
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,938
I knew that I had
the fucking crabs.

264
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,774
- There you go, mac.
- (mock shrieking)

265
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,110
Here, take them back.

266
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,446
Here are your crabs back,
you fuck.

267
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,407
The gift that keeps giving, huh?
You still have 'em, sir?

268
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,618
You know how to get rid of 'em?
By the way, this is true.

269
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,578
You take a really good,
good lighter,

270
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,705
and you shave
one testicle,

271
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,292
and you light
the other testicle on fire.

272
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,961
- The critters run from...
- Critters!

273
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,048
...the burning testicle
onto the shaved one.

274
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,717
Okay, and then
you take an ice pick,

275
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,845
and you just jam it
into the fuckers!

276
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,015
Aah, aah!
True.

277
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,768
Is it possible
to have a conversation

278
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,311
that's a little
more serious?

279
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,812
- No, no!
- No!

280
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,147
- Come on.
- Fuck that.

281
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,191
That's what
I fuckin' hate, man.

282
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,860
Is people... we...
we can no longer

283
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,404
do and say the things
that make us feel good.

284
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,822
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

285
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,115
Are you saying
that doing and saying

286
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,575
stupid things
makes you feel good?

287
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,743
Richard: You know what
I'm talking about.

288
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,954
Like, when we get
past 40,

289
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,500
we can no longer be honest
about what makes us laugh.

290
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,543
And if you're
a father, forget it.

291
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,047
You show any immaturity,
you lose all credibility.

292
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,924
Oh, come on.
Blah, blah, blah.

293
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,052
- Come on, that's pathetic.
- You are pathetic, Ron, because...

294
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,637
- What?
- You don't need to participate

295
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,139
in a conversation
that might be illuminating

296
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,683
because you're such
a powerful man.

297
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,644
Oh, no, that's not
fucking it, by the way.

298
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,813
I am here to talk
about Volvos...

299
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,356
- vulvas.
- Volvos!

300
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,524
(laughter)

301
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,359
- I got one of those.
- And schlongs.

302

00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,729
- Happy birthday.
- Timmy!

315
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,690

- Here's to us.

- Jonathan: Yeah!

317
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,696

327
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,366
Man: Why do you dislike
rock 'n' roll so much?

328
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,118
Man #2: These days, it's a disease.
It's a plague.

329
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,661
It's been going on
for too long.

330
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,788
It's history.
It's not achieving anything.

331
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,289
It's just digression.

332
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,834
They play rock 'n' roll
at airports.

333
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,504
It's about as, like,
advanced as it can possibly get.

334
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,506
Man: But there was a time
when you didn't feel that way.

335
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,925
Man #2: It is too much like
a structure, a church...

336
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,969
- Man: Yeah, but there was a...
- Man #2:a religion, a farce.

337
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,054
Man: A time when you
did not feel that way.

338
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,765
- What made you change...
- Man #2: No, I've always felt this way.

339
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,767
Man: Even when you were working
with the Sex Pistols?

340
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,270
Man #2: I wondered when
you'd get round to that one.

341
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,272
- Ahh.
- Man #2: Yes, even then,

342
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,898
because the Sex Pistols
was going to be

343
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,817
the absolute end
of rock 'n' roll,

344
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,527
which I thought it was.

345
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,696
Unfortunately,
the majority of the public,

346
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,657
being the senile animals that they are,
got that wrong.

347
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,201
Man: Where did the name
the Sex Pistols come from?

348
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,412
Who thought
that name up?

349
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,372
Man #2: Some animal.
I can't remember.

350
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,167
It doesn't matter.
It's history.

351
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,669
Well, I think history
matters a little bit.

352
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,213
When you say "some animal,"
was this a member of the band...

353
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,300
History does not matter.

354
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,635
I mean, your program
is called "Tomorrow."

355
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,387
There must be a reason
behind that.

356
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,264
Man: Well, unless we remember
our yesterdays,

357
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,932
there will be no tomorrows.

358
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,851

Come on, Timmy.
More, more!

407
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,115
- Gotta get a hard-on.
- I can't! This is so bad!

408
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,784
Fuck, yeah!
Fuck you!

409

Let's go faster.

Yeah!

414
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,347
Whoa, whoa!

415
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,683
Whoo-hoo!

416
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,436
Richard: Ho ho!
This is really hard.

417
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,772
Whoa, whoa! No!

(both laughing)

419
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,822
- Are you dead?
- Oh.

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,532
- Fuck!
- Oh, fuck.

421
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,201
Fuck.

422
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,203
- Come on.
- Hold on, how do I...

423
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,829
Come on.
I'll radio for help.

424
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,540
- To the dunes, man.
- (both laughing)

425
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,835
- Richard: How are they gonna find us?
- They'll find us.

426

(hip hop music playing)

427
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,966
The best swimsuit
of all time...

428
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,553
- Cheryl Tiegs in the...
- The big areolas, like ka-kaw!

429
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,305
- Yeah, exactly.
- Fuckin' ka-kaw!

430
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,766
- She's wearing a hammock.
- Here's what I miss, okay.

431
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,809
- Yes.
- I miss pussy hair.

432
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,269
Yeah?

433
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,437
- Is that so fucking wrong?
- No.

434
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,730
Everybody looks like
a fucking Barbie doll.

435
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,565
You know, you don't want
to have a fucking machete

436
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,318
and get in there and just...
night vision goggles and shit.

437
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,195
You want a clean runway.

438
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,032
- Richard: Oh, yeah.
- Tim: Oh, my God.

439
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,494
Look at this.
(laughs)

440
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,663
(seagulls screeching)

441
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,045
- Oh, wow.
- This is the best I've felt all year,

442
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,173
- being here with you guys.
- Yes, indeed. Yes.

443
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,592
But I know it's because
I can't feel anything.

444
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,594
- Drugs.
- Maybe it's not.

445
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:59,265
Maybe it's... it's us,
being together.

446
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:04,144
- Don't just rule that out.
- That's why we do this.

447
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,854
That's right.

448
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,941
The question, Rich,
is that why we do this?

449
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,943
I love it.
I think it's fantastic.

450
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,362
I mean,
I look forward to it.

451
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,156
I plan for it.

452
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:19,326
I need it.

453
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,622
I mean, it's like
Christmas for me.

454
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,124
Or if you're
a non-Christian,

455
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,584
it's like your birthday.

456
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,502
Yeah, or if you're
a Jehovah's Witness,

457
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,963
don't celebrate birthdays,
then it's like the day you get married.

458
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,008
You know, it's slightly
less subdued than I imagine

459
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,303
the typical Jehovah's Witness
wedding to be.

460
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,388
But at your wedding?

461
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,349
(laughs)
My wedding.

462
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,272
Oh, man.

463
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,733
We are marooned.

464
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,986
We are stuck, man.

465
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,447
Why don't you have
a woman, Rich?

466
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,449
I mean, I know
you have women...

467
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,117
but, like, the woman.

468
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,494
Why?

469
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,955
Why do I need the woman?
Why? Why?

470
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,583
You know, you know...
to tame you,

471
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,168
to train you.

472
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:13,172
I'm... I'm trained.
I'm house-trained, you know.

473
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,965
(sniffing)

474
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,343
Untamed, maybe,

475
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,970
but I don't piss
on the carpets.

476
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,972
It's okay, man,

477
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,933
to let a girl love you.

478
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,312
Who... who wants this?

479
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,105
Hmm?

480
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,899
My mother?

481
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,818
She's...

482
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,364
You fuck lots of women.

483
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,785
Have you ever
truly loved one?

484
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,912
(sighs)

485
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,583
I love 'em all.

486
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,628
Can't love 'em all
if you only love one.

487
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,551
If that's true,
that's interesting.

488
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,263
Yeah.

489
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,808
You want to know
what I think, Timothy?

490
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,853
When they really
get to see me...

491
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,525
they don't like
what they see.

492
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,404
You make sure of that.

493
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,157
Maybe.

494
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,454
(horn honking)

495
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,873
- Richard: Whoa ho!
- There they...

496
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,917
- Whoa ho!
- Hey!

497
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,503
- Whoa ho!
- Up here!

498
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,547
Hey, you guys!

499
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,509
Well played.

500
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,554
Porsches are known
for taking up sand dunes.

501
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,265
(grunting)
Not gonna work.

502
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,225
We've got your energy.

503
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,061

Oh, help is here!

The SEC

Jesus Christ.

00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,846
Thank you.

533
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,064
Recognize anyone here?

534
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,443
(Ron laughs)
Oh, jeez.

535
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,778
Who the fuck
are those people?

536
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,281
(sniffles)

537
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,576
I don't even
recognize that guy.

538
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,957
Do you ever get scared?

539
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,005
What are you asking me?

540
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,133
I guess I'm asking you if your life
turned out the way you thought it would.

541
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,638
Look, I just want to have
a good time, man, okay?

542
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,640
I just... all that...
that dreamy shit,

543
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,642
it's not... it's just...
it ain't for me, man.

544
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,894
- Not now, not now.
- Very hunter and gatherer of you.

545
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,480
Well, you've always been more
evolved than me, Tim... always.

546
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,231
But being part girl
will do that to you...

547
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,317
help you to develop
your sensitivity, you know?

548
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,779
I get it.
Look, I just...

549
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,134
Richard:
Eyes closed, mouth open.

550
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,017
- Dilaudid.
- (laughs)

551
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,061
A morphine derivative.

552
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,313
I had a patient

553
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,274
who offered me money
for a prescription.

554
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,029
It changed the landscape
of my practice.

555
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,492
She had a lot of friends.

556
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,373
And this became
your practice

557
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:26,128
rather than the one that you imagined
you would have.

558
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,550
I remember
in college saying,

559
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,511
"You can write
about people,

560
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,347
and I can save lives."

561
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,738
Man: Mother Earth is pregnant
for the third time,

562
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,324
for y'all have
knocked her up.

563
00:33:56,492 --> 00:34:00,495
I have tasted the maggots
in the mind of the universe.

564
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,748
I was not offended,

565
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,418
for I knew I had
to rise above it all,

566
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,253
or drown
in my own shit...

567
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,256
- How you feeling, big fellow?
- Fuck off!

568
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,425
(laughter)

569
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,764
- Tim: Oh, just...
- Great. This is great.

570
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,350
- Come on, the air, the birds.
- Oh, I love it. You kiddin'?

571
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,270
Are you kiddin'?
The best.

572
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,744
- (vomiting)
- (guys laughing)

573
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,917
Jonathan:
You okay, man?

574
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,460
Ron:
Hey, man,

575
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,087
it's a brilliant idea,
coming out here.

576
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,923
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,133
(mocking)
"I got an idea, let's go fishing.

578
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,636
Let's go fishing.
Argh argh!"

579
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,679
Ron:
And the best news is,

580
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,973
we're gonna
be here all day.

581
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,727
- (Tim laughing)
- Jonathan: "It sounds fun!"

582
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,814
- Fuck you guys!
- We're having a reunion.

583
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,628
Give me a pole!

584
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,258
Let's do it.
What you got for me?

585
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,510
No, wait.
I'll take his place.

586
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,014
Hey, Timmy,
I think I got one!

587
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,017
(laughing)

588
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,520
Oh, shit.

589
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,947
So... this is
a reunion, huh?

590
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,617
We all went
to college together.

591
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,037
Jonathan and Richard have known
each other since grade school.

592
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,248
We meet every year
somewhere.

593
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,626
That's nice.
It's... it's nice.

594
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,795
- It's good to catch up.
- Sure is.

595
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,090
I left school
when I was 14.

596
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,759
The sea kept me
moving,

597
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,094
so I never had
any reunions,

598
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,263
except for
with my wife

599
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,557
after long
fishing trips.

600
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,771
She died 11 years ago.

601
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,440
Cancer.

602
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,651
So I spend
most of my days

603
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,402
out here
just drifting around,

604
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,988
trying to
figure things out.

605
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,990
I realize I was...
I was lucky

606
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,951
to have felt
something that looked

607
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:31,248
or smelled or...
resembled real love.

608
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,626
Most folks
never taste that.

609
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,797
I tasted it,

610
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,926
and it made
every day anointed.

611
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,598
Nothing mattered
when we were together.

612
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,477
And when we were apart...

613
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,856
I felt him.

614
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,821
I felt him

615
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,990
like my own breath.

616
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,286
Do you believe
in heaven?

617
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,333
I wish I did.

618
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,513
♪ All righty, boy,
all righty, boy. ♪

619
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,648
- Are you still writing?
- Yeah.

620
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,818
Yeah, I write.
I write all the time, Ron.

621
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,864
I write report cards.

622
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,532
I write
on chalkboards.

623
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,035
I write to the school board
and ask for more money.

624
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,496
And sometimes I write,
"Dear God,

625
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,540
when You get a chance,

626
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,126
can You tell me why I've got
nothing to write about?"

627
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,837
What does that
gibberish mean, man?

628
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,882
- (snorting)
- I'm a...

629
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,343
I'm an English teacher now.

630
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,512
For now,

631
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,931
I'm a teacher of English.

632
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,397
How is Amanda?

633
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,026
I tell you,
Rich, man,

634
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:26,404
sometimes I can't believe
that I chose so well.

635
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,573
I wake up with that warm body
next to mine,

636
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,241
and I just...

637
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,911
Yeah,
you're a lucky man.

638
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,915
She doesn't push me
or question me, you know?

639
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,585
We respect what we both do,
and it's defined.

640
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,420
I know my role.

641
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,926
But I still don't know

642
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,762
why I've done the things
that I've done.

643
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:00,522
I'm in trouble, Rich.

644
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,234
I'm in deep,
over-my-head,

645
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,945
drowning,
motherfucking...

646
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,239
trouble.

647
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,014
- You want me to go get the food?
- All right, yeah.

648
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,642
Sounds good, man.
(sniffles)

649
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,500
(blues music playing)

650
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:09,340
(whistling along)

651
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,843
Did you have
the large order to go?

652
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,597
Yeah, well, is there
anyone else here

653
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,850
who might have
my order?

654
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,270
- Just one.
- God damn, I bet you that's mine.

655
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,025
- (clicks tongue)
- Would you like to pay now?

656
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:31,196
Oh, yeah, ahem,
of course.

657
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:34,115
Would you like to go home
with my order?

658
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,410
(laughs)
I'm working.

659
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,621
And you should probably
work on your lines.

660
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,790
If I work on my lines,
would you consider my offer?

661
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,461
No.

662
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,796
(snaps fingers)

663
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,423
Yeah.

664
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,843
She likes me.
She likes me.

665
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,058
Looks like you're
feeding an army there.

666
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,811
(clears throat)

667
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,314
- Walk out with me.
- What?

668
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,234
I want you to take
that apron off,

669
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,779
throw it on the floor,
walk around the bar,

670
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,032
and leave with me
right now.

671
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,037
You're really high,
aren't you?

672
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,415
You say that
like you like it.

673
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,960
I'm gonna give you
my number.

674
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:30,255
I'm in town
for three days.

675
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,552
I got three friends.
We're harmless and fun.

676
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,679
Maybe you've got
three friends,

677
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,723
you want to come over,
it's up to you.

678
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,142
But, hey,
if you're planning

679
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,604
on throwing that away
and not calling me...

680
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,150
wait till I'm about
10 minutes away, okay?

Anyway, this rich guy Greenberg
moves into town,

786
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,937
and he's building
this ugly 25,000-foot mansion

787
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,272
right on the ocean
in front of my mom's house.

788
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,440
Here, hit this.

789
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,649
She's tried
to stop him legally,

790
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,276
but he just crushes her
with his money.

791
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,820
Fucker's putting in
a helicopter pad.

792
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,488
Hey, you know,
if the guy can live

793
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,490
like a king,
why the fuck not?

794
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,826
Why is total excess
equated with living like a king?

795
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,494
I mean, why do people
need all that shit?

796
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,288
'Cause the shit
is there.

797
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,123
That's crazy.

798
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,666
You... you actually
believe that?

799
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,461
Mm-mm.
I don't believe it, I know it.

800
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,713
No, you can't know something
if it's a choice.

801
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,214
Where did you learn
that college bullshit,

802
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,716
from your
philosophy professor?

803
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,177
I'm just saying people
don't need certain things,

804
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,428
even though they might
think they do.

805
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,722
How the fuck would you know
what people need?

806
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,766
Who pays your tuition, huh?

807
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,935
Who pays
your fucking rent?

808
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,603
Mom and Dad.

809
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,148
You're a little fucking infant in
diapers, you fucking bitch.

810
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,650
Why don't you come
and talk to me

811
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,777
when the naiveté
wears off, all right?

818
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,720
Jonathan, do you have
any idea what time it is?

819
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,306
- Um...
- 5:30 in the morning.

820
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,975
Miles is sleeping.

821
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,937
I just want to hear
his voice.

822
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,897
And you know
that Daniel works late.

823
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,234
Yeah, so he can control
the fucking world's oil markets.

824
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,819
How does he make
so much money

825
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,862
when the rest
of the country is so broke?

826
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,991
Are you drunk?

827
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,660
No, I'm fuckin' high.

828
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,537
I'm high as fuckin' shit.

829
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,083
You get together
with your old friends,

830
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,253
and you can't even pretend
that you're grownups.

831
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,797
I'm pretending
that you still love me.

832
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,424
Jonathan, stop.

833
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,093
I'm hanging up.

834
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,350
Jane, just...
just tell me again

835

to not loving me.

that's what paper is.

844

And you gotta stay
on top of it.

845
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,473
What kind of shit
do you write?

846
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,517
I just write stories, things that mean
something to me.

847
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,770
Ah, the personal stuff.

848

Oh, God, no,
he's so great.

I mean, he's...
he's really amazing.

850
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,611
And then so you...
you submit them, right,

851
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:17,156
to... to quarterlies,
crap like that?

852
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,158
My last one actually ran
in the "New Yorker."

853
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,328
We were all so proud.

854
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,205
Oh.

855
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,248
And then you'll write
another one,

856
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:30,002
and then you'll get
the heat behind you,

857
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,629
and then you...
that will...

858
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:36,675
that will push you through
to write the novel,

859
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:40,179
to type "The end."

860
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:45,059
And then
fucking what?

861
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,315
I don't understand.
I mean...

862
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,735
is there something
wrong with that?

863
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,113
You published a book.

864
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,989
I'd love to be able
to do that.

865
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,200
I was...
I was like that.

866
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:06,372
I was so fucking
excited about this,

867
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,749
and... and about that,

868
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,711
but you just...

869
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,881
you think it's gonna
be so fucking rosy,

870
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,050
so fucking rosy...

871
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,427
- Well, Jonah's not like that.
- No?

872
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,097
He doesn't think anything's gonna be
some certain way.

873
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,891
- He just loves to write.
- You don't have to speak...

874
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:31,272
You... you live in some
sort of disillusionment,

875
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,024
because it's easier
than being honest.

876
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:38,445
- Jonah: Wow.
- What are you hiding from, old man?

877
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,699
(laughs)

878
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:46,120
You think that he's gonna be like you
when he's older...

879
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,750
'cause it makes you
feel better about yourself.

880
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,087
I still love it.

You look...

you look just like
my sister Jill.

896
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,893
You should ask her
to come over.

- Then I can judge for myself.
- That's impossible.

00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,138

01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,562
- (grunting)
- Come on, do it!

947
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,523
Get it!

948
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,359
- Tim, Tim, Tim.
- (Jonathan crying)

949
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,240
Timmy, Timmy!
Wake up, Tim.

950
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,991
- Rich.
- Oh, God.

951
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,868
- Hey, hey.
- He's dead.

952
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,370
- What?
- Ron: What's going on?

953
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,122
- He's fuckin' dead!
- What's going on?

954
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,708
He's gone!
Would you fucking listen to me?

955
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,917
- What are you fuckin'...
- He's fuckin' gone!

956
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,044
- Ron: What happened?
- He's gone!

957
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,214
Our fucking friend is gone.
Let him be, let him be.

958
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:15,480
(sobbing)

959
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,077
- Tim.
- Okay.

960
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,923
He even shaved.

961
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,488
"25 years from now..."

962
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:08,700
(muttering)

963
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,722
What are we
supposed to do?

964
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,891
What are we supposed to...?

965
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,196
(paper rustling)

966
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,454
Motherfucker beat me
to the punch.

967
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,206
Somebody help me,

968
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,793
because I'm...
I'm lost here.

969
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,421
I'm not.

970
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,464
(scoffs)

971
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,050
I remember everything.

972
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:54,806
Senior year,
the room upstairs,

973
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,559
the green couch,
the slanted walls,

974
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,395
the Joy Division posters
all over the walls

975
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,565
- like it was yesterday.
- It was Timmy's idea.

976
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:08,236
He said, "Will we ever
remember this moment?

977
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,114
Will we ever have
friends like this?"

978
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,409
"Will we ever
feel this way again?

979
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,288
This alive, this free,

980
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,166
this possible again?"

981
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,210
Oh, God, I...

982
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:28,131
I'll never forget it,
and yet...

983
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,135
I forgot it.

984
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,804
We all did.

985
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,057
We all forgot it.

986
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,725
Tim didn't.

987
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,689
Look, we all said
a lot of things

988
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,859
when we were young.

989
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,195
- (laughing)
- Okay.

990
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,989
Okay, so this... this means
nothing to you?

991
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,824
Your word's no good.

992
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:58,620
Look, we're gonna call
the police now, right?

993
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,038
And say what?

994
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,124
That we signed an oath,
and now our friend is dead?

995
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,793
"Please come
pick up the body"?

996
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,087
Who gives
a fucking shit?

997
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,716
Fuck.

998
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,135
Timmy obviously did.

999
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,764
You know, he remembered
what we wanted to be,

1000
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:22,018
and... so do I.

1001
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,979
You're... this is insane,
by the way.

1002
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,731
We're high.
We are high as shit.

1003
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,984
Which is why we need
to just think this through.

1004
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:31,319
Ron: Look, we just need
to come down, all right?

1005
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:35,365
- Sleep it off, all right?
- I can't come down, okay?

1006
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,242
Now, well, hold...
okay, okay, I'm confused...

1007
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,743
shut the fuck up.
I'm confused.

1008
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,205
Are we talking about
not calling the cops?

1009
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,707
All our names
are on that note.

1010
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,334
That piece of fucking shit
scrawl signified

1011
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:48,211
means nothing!

1012
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,923
I'm not the same
fucking fool who signed that.

1013
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,800
Neither are you,
all right?

1014
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,135
Things change.

1015
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:57,470
No, you certainly are not
the same person, Ron.

1016
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,723
What the fuck
does that mean?

1017
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:04,769
Okay, so our bond
is no good to you,

1018
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,896
a promise we made...

1019
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:11,401
none of that
means anything.

1020
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,322
Your dead friend...
(whistles)

1021
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,659
It means we fucking
think about it.

1022
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,787
It means that I am not
the same person.

1023
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,456
None of us are.

1024
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,631
You're not
the same person?

1025
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,133
You're not the same
fucking friend?

1026
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,510
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you. I'm a father.

1027
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,929
- And? And?
- And so are you!

1028
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:43,850
Jonathan sees his son
once every two weeks,

1029
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,979
and his son calls
his stepfather "Dad."

1030
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,317
You write your name
in blood,

1031
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,069
and... and it means what?

1032
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,030
Your blood means
hooey to you.

1033
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:01,993
So, you go home, Ron.
Go to your mother.

1034
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:07,040
Go to your wife,
who you love,

1035
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,502
and you go explain to her
how badly you fucked up, okay?

1036
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:13,880
You failed.
You disappointed.

1037
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,758
And how badly
did you fuck up, huh?

1038
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,595
You greedy cocksucker.
What did you do?

1039
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,097
You a bank robber?

1040
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,724
Hmm? Steal people's money?

1041
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,310
A bank robber now?
Bang, bang, bang!

1042
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:29,729
Ronnie the bank robber!
Tell us!

1043
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,523
Did you go bad on us?

1044
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,316
Are you like the hideous men
we read... Jonathan,

1045
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,027
did our little Ronnie
go bad on us?

1046
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,862
Yeah, hello, we have
an emergency.

1047
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,364
What the fuck
are you doing?

1048
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,075
Listen, someone
has committed suicide.

1049
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,453
We have to call the cops.
We have to report this.

1050
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,331
- That's...
- This is who we are.

1051
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,333
If, when we wrote it,
we were not that...

1052
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:51,543
Let me just
get this straight...

1053
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,713
you want me to sign off
on some 25-year-old

1054
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,633
idealistic
piece of bullshit

1055
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,635
that I don't
even remember?

1056
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,596
Richard, are you
kidding me with this?

1057
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,098
This is not a reality.

1058
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,641
This has nothing
to do with now.

1059
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,562
- Tim is dead.
- No, Timmy died for his reasons.

1060
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,731
That's right.
You know, guilt...

1061
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,359
I know he could never
live with himself,

1062
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,654
but he did it.

1063
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,323
- He was weak.
- That was...

1064
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,367
that was his choice, pal.

1065
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,869
That was his life.

1066
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,787
You know what...
you never followed through

1067
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,498
on a motherfucking thing
in your entire life, not even then.

1068
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,127
You know what we used to call you
behind your back, buddy?

1069
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,588
"Rat Ron."

1070
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,089
Rat Ron.

1071
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:42,927
Because you were
a fucking rodent.

1072
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:46,848
You were selling us tickets to concerts
that you got for free.

1073
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,892
You were trying to fuck
Jonathan's girlfriend.

1074
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:52,937
Rat fucking Ron...
always had to be the man,

1075
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:54,606
the man with the plan.

1076
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,692
Well, you tell me...
tell me, Rat Ron,

1077
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,944
is that why you're
in so much trouble now?

1078
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,446
You fucking loser.

1079
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,114
Where are all
your best-sellers, huh?

1080
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:06,201
Where are all your fucking best-sellers,
you fucking hack?

1081
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,871
Did you forget when Rat Ron bailed you
out of jail when we were seniors?

1082
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,290
You forget about that? Because your
mommy didn't have any fucking money?

1083
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,043
Arty little Richard
with no fucking money.

1084
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,544
And Ron had
all the money,

1085
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,588
'cause that was
my fucking role.

1086
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,299
You were art, I was commerce...
that's what you said.

1087
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,134
- You remember that?
- Yes.

1088
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,761
And you... how much money
did I make for you over the years,

1089
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,181
you fucking
zombie quack fuck?

1090
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,183
Richard:
Let me... let me try to lay this out

1091
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,644
for you in a language
that you can understand, okay?

1092
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:36,105
The way I see it,
you got two choices.

1093
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:37,815
One: You can stay here.

1094
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:41,110
Two: You can die there.

1095
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,655
'Cause I got a feeling
no matter what kind of bullshit

1096
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:46,324
you wrapped yourself up into, man,
you are in it so deep,

1097
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,493
it is going to
fuck you in the ass

1098
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,954
and swallow you whole.

1099
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:53,248
This is insane.

1100
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,500
This is fucking insane.

1101
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,585
Oh, my God.

1102
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,004
Fucking Timmy.

1103
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,757
I think you
should leave, Ron.

1104
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,094
I think it's best.

1105
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,515
All right, I'm gonna go
pack up my stuff, all right?

1106
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,434
I'm gonna take off. I'm going home.
(sniffles)

1107
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,436
I just want
to make it clear that I left

1108
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,314
before any of this
happened, all right?

1109
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:22,360
All right.

1110
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,614
(acoustic guitar music playing)

1111
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:35,206
We should do
something about Timmy.

1112
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,228

That's good.

1134
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,351
It's really beautiful,
Richard.

1135
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,154
(wind howling)

1136
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,785
Hey, fellas.

1137
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,498
Captain Bob.
It's good to see you.

1138
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,417
You, too.
Where's your buddy Tim?

1139
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,463
He, uh...

1140
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,009
Yeah, he... he had
some other plans...

1141
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:58,678
- Ron: Yeah.
- Pretty sudden.

1142
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:01,264
- Had to take off.
- Yep.

1143
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,475
Gee, he must have
been disappointed to have to leave.

1144
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,810
Guys: Yeah.

1145
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,520
Captain Bob:
Guess he went home sour

1146
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,021
'cause he didn't
catch any fish.

1147
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:11,524
- (laughs) Probably.
- Probably.

1148
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:14,485
Got so embarrassed,
he just took off.

1149
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,530
Yeah, he said he had
some important business.

1150
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,448
Hmm.

1151
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:22,827
All right, well,
you boys take care.

1152
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,538
- Ron: All right.
- See you around.

1153
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,764
- Man: Oh!
- Woman: Oh, my God!

1154
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,767
- Oh! Oh!
- Man #2: Jesus!

1155
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,854
- Man #3: Somebody call 9-1-1!
- Oh, my God!

1156
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,231
- Call 9-1-1!
- I got him.

1157
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,735
- They're on their way.
- I got him.

1158
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,447
Jonathan:
Come on.

1159
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,659
Let's go. Live.

1160
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:05,828
Let's go, live.

1161
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,873
Live.

1162
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,732
Woman:
What happened?

1163
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,735
Captain Bob: Larry McCauley
had a heart attack.

1164
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:42,615
- Is he okay?
- One of those guys saved his life.

1165
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,533
- Really?
- Yeah.

1166
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:46,994
I know 'em. They've been out
on the boat with me.

1167
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,080
And they've been
hitting it real hard.

1168
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:53,376
They are a motley crew.
Not from around here.

1169
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:28,536
- Hi.
- Hi.

1170
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,663
I'm Laura Boyd.
Sorry to bother you.

1171
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,998
No bother.
What's up?

1172
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:36,460
The Athertons
sometimes have me

1173
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,462
pass by and check in.

1174
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,673
I was in the area.

1175
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,383
So there's just
the four of you here?

1176
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,635
No, one guy took off.

1177
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,304
But who's counting?
(chuckles)

1178
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,099
(chuckles)
Nobody.

1179
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,853
Yeah, he, uh... our buddy had to go back
to Portland for business.

1180
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,692
- Are you the doctor?
- No, no.

1181
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,611
He's sleeping
after the heroics.

1182
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:06,365
- Yes, and it was heroic.
- Yeah.

1183
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,578
You know, I've seen
that Porsche somewhere.

1184
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,913
Oh, uh, yeah,
my buddy,

1185
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,583
he bought it off a local,
so probably...

1186
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,626
- Right, yeah.
...seen it around.

1187
01:19:17,794 --> 01:19:20,504
And the other one's mine.
It's a rental.

1188
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:23,883
That one?
That one there? That's yours?

1189
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:27,011
- What's your name?
- Ron.

1190
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,805
Why?
Something wrong?

1191
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:34,351
No, no, Ron,
there's nothing wrong.

1192
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,853
(engine starts)

1193
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:14,034
You look like shit,
Jonathan.

1194
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,371
I'm making a salad.

1195
01:21:22,502 --> 01:21:25,462
How long has
he been sleeping?

1196
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,631
Hours.

1197
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,842
Yo, Ronaldo.

1198
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:15,137
Hey, man, um,
we got something.

1199
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,973
You gotta try this.

1200
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:21,727
I'm so scared.

1201
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,230
Of what?

1202
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:27,524
You mean Timmy?

1203
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:31,236
- That cop that was here?
- What we're doing here.

1204
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:36,533
Yeah.

1205
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:39,370
Amanda left
some messages, man.

1206
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,291
The feds are at my home.

1207
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,796
I robbed clients,

1208
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,297
but I never
cheated on Amanda.

1209
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,299
I never cheated
on her ever.

1210
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,884
- All right.
- Yeah.

1211
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,720
- Okay.
- Never.

1212
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:00,432
And, you know,
in the beginning,

1213
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,476
I was trying
to help people, man.

1214
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,854
I'm trying, you know,

1215
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:07,940
to enrich them.

1216
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,441
And then...

1217
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,236
(sighs)
...something gets inside you,

1218
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,238
some... some rationale,
you know.

1219
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,198
And then you just take
a little for yourself,

1220
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,951
just a little bit,
and then...

1221
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,706
you know, one zero
turns into two and three

1222
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:27,918
and more and more and more
and more and more, man.

1223
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,087
More.
You can't...

1224
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,381
it's just...
it's just a drug, man.

1225
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:36,927
You just... you get high
and you drift.

1226
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,390
Why'd you need so much?

1227
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:50,858
I love taking care
of my family, man.

1228
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,363
I was the man.

1229
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:59,324
I was the man
for a while, Rich.

1230
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:02,202
I wish you
coulda seen me.

1231
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:06,040
I really wish
you coulda seen me.

1232
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:09,877
Amanda... will...
will she forgive you?

1233
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:14,965
No one will.

1234
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:37,946
Will you do it?

1235
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:39,615
- Fuck you, Ron.
- Please.

1236
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,575
- Please. Do it.
- No.

1237
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,327
- I can't do it.
- Don't... don't...

1238
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:46,622
I have to do it.
I have to.

1239
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:49,166
You don't have to.

1240
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,043
You... you can go home.
You can face it.

1241
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:53,712
I've tried, man.
I tried. I can't.

1242
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,091
I tried to think
of myself going home

1243
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:01,970
and s-s-seeing her

1244
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:06,600
and having her
look into me...

1245
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,646
in my eyes, and I...

1246
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:20,114
I can't face it.
I can't face it.

1247
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,533
I can't.

1248
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,701
You have to do it.

1249
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:32,042
Please.

1250
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:35,087
Come on.
Come on.

1251
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,548
Come on.

1252
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:39,800
Please do it.

1253
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:50,811
I remember
when I met you.

1254
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,729
You were
such an asshole...

1255
01:25:52,897 --> 01:25:56,108
- (both chuckle)
...but you were cool.

1256
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:01,780
Yeah, you were
this dark guy

1257
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:04,575
with his dead dad,
and I thought you were...

1258
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:07,619
you were so cool.

1259
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:12,249
You turned me on

Jane: Hello?

1421
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,870
- Hey, Jane.
- Hi, Jonathan.

1422
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:45,663
He's right here.

1423
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:47,248
Miles: Hi.

1424
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:50,543
(laughing)
Hey, buddy.

1425
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:54,505
- Miles, how are you?
- Good.

1426
01:40:54,673 --> 01:40:57,050
Daddy took me
on a helicopter yesterday

1427
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,010
because he had to meet
someone for lunch.

1428
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,597
I was only
a little scared.

1429
01:41:06,935 --> 01:41:09,270
Miles,
I'm your daddy.

1430
01:41:14,276 --> 01:41:16,652
You know that.

1431
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:19,781
We could see
the whole city.

1432
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:29,499
Miles, Daniel
is your stepfather.

1433
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:34,295
- I'm your father.
- What?

1434
01:41:36,548 --> 01:41:39,175
Promise me
you'll remember that.

1435
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:41,385
Jane: Miles, come on.
We need to go.

1436
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:44,097
Miles:
Oh. I have to go.

Miles... Miles...

1438
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:47,642
- Mommy and Daddy said.
- Miles...

1439
01:41:47,810 --> 01:41:49,936
promise me you'll remember
I'm your daddy.

it can keep me alive

I'm here.

I love my friends.

I... I thought about them
when I was weak.

But you know what?

1510
01:50:27,996 --> 01:50:29,246
It only made
me feel weaker.

1511
01:50:29,414 --> 01:50:31,290
You know why?
Because...

1512
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:34,877
because you... you can't
have the past back.

1513
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:39,840
No, no.

1514
01:50:40,008 --> 01:50:41,925
Every time
we were together,

1515
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:44,678
we're not...
we were not present.

1516
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:48,349
We weren't here!
We were wasted!

1517
01:50:48,516 --> 01:50:52,061
We were always
fuckin' wasted, okay?

1518
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:58,567
And we didn't do

1519
01:50:58,735 --> 01:51:02,863
what we said we would.

1520
01:51:06,701 --> 01:51:10,621
So, maybe...

1521
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:13,248
all this

1522
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:18,462
was a way of saying...

1523
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:22,049
we remembered.

1524
01:51:26,471 --> 01:51:30,933
We remembered
what we used to feel.

1525
01:51:38,316 --> 01:51:40,734
Where are your friends,
Richard?

1526
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:42,736
You want to know
where my friends are?

1527
01:51:42,904 --> 01:51:44,905
I need to know.

1528
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:50,577
Tell me.

1529
01:51:50,745 --> 01:51:53,914
- They're dead.
- What?

1530
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,999
They're buried
in the back,

1531
01:51:56,167 --> 01:52:00,170
in the rocks,
in the sand.

1532

They're dead.

Oh, my...
oh, my God.

1534

You went back there.

1536
