23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,180
What's up? Why didn't you call me?

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,720
He Hao Yi.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You really just called my name.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm going to brush my teeth.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,100
He Hao Yi!

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Go on a date with me.

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I want to believe you, so go on a date with me.

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,300
Why do you suddenly want to ride the bus?

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Thinking back to high school, if I wasn't with Lei Lei or with friends,

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I would use the slowest form of transportation to get to the classroom.

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,180
I would take a look all around and worry that someone else might discover that I was searching all around.

34
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,200
What were you looking for?

35
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,470
You.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,200
To see if you left the school already or if you were still playing basketball.

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,700
If you weren't at the basketball court, I had to run.

38
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,050
Run?

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,200
Hey... there are cars!

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
"Hi! What a coincidence!"

41
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,010
Then you would say...

42
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,650
"Come on, why would it be a coincidence? We go to the same school."

43
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,210
So I had to run faster in order to ride the same bus with you.

44
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,500
I didn't know this.

45
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,500
Hey, be careful!

46
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,600
You're really overreacting.

47
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm not.

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Emergency stop.

49
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,200
The driver completely understood what I was thinking.

50
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Let's look for his name

51
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
and call his company to tattle on him.

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Idiot.

53
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Ai Li Si!

54
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Ai Li Si!

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Did you get a little anxious because I'd disappeared?

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm angry.

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,900
Not anxious?

58
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,850
I want to eat instant noodles.

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,900
Just because you want to eat instant noodles, you suddenly jumped off the bus?

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,600
- I told you to eat something more nutritious for breakfast.<br>- I want to eat instant noodles!

61
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,900
Okay, let's eat.

62
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,700
Here!

63
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,810
For me?

64
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Peel off the eggshell for me.

89
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,500
Aren't you going to buy another one?

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,300
It doesn't matter.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,900
Go buy it.

92
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,870
The sun is so strong, why aren't you holding an umbrella?

93
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,980
You aren't holding an umbrella, either.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Also, I've used a sun protector.

95
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
The facial mask I gave you can whiten your skin, too.

96
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
That's why I use it every day.

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,980
Really?

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

99
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,740
Forget it. I'll speak first.

100
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,980
Liu Xiao Fen, why did you respond so strongly?

101
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It wasn't the first time I didn't pick up your call because I was in love. Did you have to react in such a way?

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,500
It doesn't matter if anybody else doesn't understand me, but don't you even understand me?

103
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,970
- It was because Song Han Ming is...<br>- I know!

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,300
You're right.

105
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,810
Song Han Ming doesn't like me at all.

106
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,570
He approached me, not for my beauty, nor my family status.

107
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,100
It was because he wanted to take revenge for Ai Li Si and himself.

108
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,600
Isn't it the little diary Ai Li Si buried in the time capsule?

109
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Why is it here?

110
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,000
Just read it. Read it!

111
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Today's Lei Lei's competition. Lei Lei's father...

112
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,540
Ai Li Si did a lot of things for us.

113
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,000
She didn't tell us anything, thinking we would know about everything because we were friends.

114
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,400
Also, she cared for our feelings.

115
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
That's enough.

116
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,200
During that time I misunderstood her, so I didn't go to our secret hideout to listen to her explanation.

117
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,900
I admit I was very capricious, okay?

118
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,600
Do you all have to remind me one by one?

119
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,800
- Lei Lei...<br>- Also, why...

120
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,300
did Ai Li Si change school?

121
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,700
I was just angry at that time.

122
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,800
And she just disappeared at that time, so we didn't even have a chance to reconcile.

123
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
She was resolute, not me.

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,000
You better not speak of Ai Li Si like that; otherwise, you'll regret it.

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
Why will I regret it?

126
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,240
Is it because you guys know something I don't?

127
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Actually, back in our high school days, Ai Li Si...

128
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,700
I never thought that Ai Li Si would be bullied.

129
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,400
I thought it was just because we ignored her,

130
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,200
she didn't come to the group activities and ate alone at lunch time.

131
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
Who knew it would be like this...

132
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
Who knew that some people would throw away her bento?

133
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
They even hid her sportswear during PE class.

134
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,790
Chen Qi Tai is such a bastard!

135
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,090
If I'd known this earlier, I wouldn't have let him off!

136
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,080
Even my brother just found out recently. Do you know how angry he was when he told me this?

137
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
I thought of someone...

138
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Hey, Lei Lei! Where are you going?

139
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,490
Where's my shoe?

140
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,450
I told you I would bring it to the company. Save you the trip.

141
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
What are you doing!?

142
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,620
I should ask you that!

143
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,910
I just took it when you pulled my leg for your nonsense self-dignity.

144
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,560
But Ai Li Si's situation is different.

145
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,720
You gave me a hard time because of her, but you didn't mention the real reason behind all this.

146
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,090
What made you think you could hide the fact that Chen Qi Tai bullied Ai Li Si?

147
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,360
Tell me.

148
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,070
Why do I have to tell you?

149
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
How you treated Ai Li Si back then, I remember very clearly.

150
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,460
Bullying is not only limited to physical beatings.

151
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,520
Ignoring her is also a kind of bullying.

152
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,960
When she needed you the most, you turned a blind eye.

153
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,930
What are you talking about?

154
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,420
Do I need to refresh your memories?

155
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,030
When you initially ignored Ai Li Si, I could understand.

156
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,150
But that day she got watered down in the toilet, you both clearly saw it.

157
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,750
We did not.

158
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,940
Don't spout nonsense.

159
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,030
It can't be that day, can it?

160
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,380
Which day?

161
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,470
The day I lent you the 5566 band CD.

162
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,390
<i>What kind of song is this? This is stupid, Liu Xiao Fen.</i>

163
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,760
<i>- Let me go. <br>- It's very interesting. You didn't know that you'd end up like this.</i>

164
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,570
<i>- Lei Lei! Lei Lei!<br>- Why did you offend him?</i>

165
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,110
<i>That's right. Are you having fun in there, Ai Li Si?</i>

166
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,360
<i>- See if you dare to do it again.<br>- You deserve it.</i>

167
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,920
<i>Hey! What are you guys doing?</i>

168
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,490
<i>Hey, don't make matters worse.</i>

169
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,570
<i>If your dad knew, he'd get mad again.</i>

170
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,840
So... the person in the restroom was Ai Li Si?

171
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,760
How can it be so coincidental?

172
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
It's all your fault.

173
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,900
I was about to go in and save her, but you stopped me.

174
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,460
My mom didn't pass on courage to me.

175
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,840
I was scared you would be scolded by your dad.

176
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,080
This stinks.

177
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,190
She definitely thought we ignored her,

178
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,800
and she also got bullied by Chen Qi Tai. That's why she transferred schools.

179
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,900
She must have been really disappointed in us.

180
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,360
That's right. We've been really bad to her.

181
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,960
<i>Time check. It's 1:57 p.m. in the afternoon.</i>

182
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,400
<i>Meet me by the company entrance at 2 p.m.</i>

183
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,720
She even gave me prior notice?

184
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,000
Hurry up. There's a hag who has been watching over us.

185
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,530
There is no hag here. The worst case, we'll just be getting a salary deduction.

186
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,640
I've always wanted to skip work at least once long ago.

187
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,570
Ever since I started as a researcher,

188
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,200
I've been afraid of having a failed experiment and uncontrollable variables.

189
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,530
Day and night, rain or shine, finally...

190
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,490
my first-phase research was a success!

191
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,180
If the research progress problem is resolved, are you going back to the US?

192
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,400
Yeah. Once I've finished the task, then I will go back.

193
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,590
But if someone misses me,

194
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,140
I will drop everything and come back as quickly as I can.

195
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,650
But... how can that person let you know she misses you?

196
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,470
Just say, "I miss you." That's enough.

197
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,770
What if she can't say it aloud?

198
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,790
Then just look at me like you are now.

199
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,310
If you are already in the US, how am I supposed to look at you?

200
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,820
Who knows. I might just pop up out of nowhere.

201
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,110
You will always be here, right?

202
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,500
Even if I make you angry, you will still accompany me. Right?

203
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,990
It's bubble tea!

204
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,960
Quickly! Time limit is five minutes.

205
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,230
<i>Thank you, He Hao Yi.</i>

206
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,710
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

207
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,690
Are you happy now?

208
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,660
You're not a child. Why do you like sweets so much?

209
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,100
Ai Li Si...

210
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,600
Whoa! Wait a minute.

211
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,040
- What are you doing?<br>- You are too funny today.

212
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,990
No, I have to take a picture.

213
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,160
Why are you so worked up?

214
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,430
My goodness, come. Take a picture with me.

215
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,360
You need to do the expression from just now.

216
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,190
That anxious expression!

217
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,320
This is great.

218
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,350
Now that I've captured this moment,

219
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,100
whenever I'm feeling down, I can look at this and laugh to death.

220
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,730
Souvenir pictures.

221
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,420
They're...

222
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,430
real couple photos.

223
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,290
- Ai Li Si! Ai Li Si!<br>- This picture has your eyes crossed.

224
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,120
I know you can't let your worries go and completely trust me.

225
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,450
But if you give me one more chance

226
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,250
and tell me where the lab journal is,

227
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,420
I can promise you I will be able to get Capital to keep supporting you

228
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,770
so you can complete your research.

229
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,760
He Hao Yi, what if I tell you that I trust you,

230
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,630
you probably wouldn't believe me. Right?

231
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,790
I will wait for you.

232
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:20,090
♫<i> I want to go forward. I want to go backward. </i>♫

233
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:28,020
♫<i> I really want to love you. To persist until the end, tell me how much courage it requires. </i>♫

234
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
<i>If the 30-year-old Ai Li Si</i>

235
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,800
<i>can open her heart to me once again, then that would be good.</i>

236
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
<i>He Hao Yi!</i>

237
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,200
<i>Are you outside?</i>

238
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Can I ask you a few questions?

239
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,120
Sure.

240
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,900
<i>Why were you injured that day?</i>

241
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,400
<i>Did you get into a fight with Chen Qi Tai?</i>

242
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
How did you know?

243
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,900
Because Chen Qi Tai also had wounds on his face.

244
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
<i>Yes.</i>

245
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,300
Was it because of me?

246
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,000
He Hao Yi, if I asked you to go bungee jumping with me again,

247
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,100
would you go?

248
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
<i>Would You?</i>

249
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
Would you jump with me?

250
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Yes.

251
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,800
I would go.

252
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,750
You really treat me well.

253
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,500
It turns out that I have so many good memories to remove.

254
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
<i>He Hao Yi,</i>

255
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,800
after I lost my memory, if you weren't able to convince Liu Xiao Fen,

256
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,600
I wouldn't be able to stay at your place.

257
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,300
<i>Whenever I lose the will to fight, you're the one to encourage me and cheer me on.</i>

258
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
If I were to write down all your good deeds on a piece of paper,

259
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,900
can I fit everything on one A4-size paper?

260
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Don't you have all kinds of notebooks?

261
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
That's true.

262
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,990
Ai Li Si,

263
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,990
<i>I know I may not have the right to say these words,</i>

264
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,000
<i>but let's forget about the bad things from the past.</i>

265
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,430
The reason that we reminisce about the past is to learn some lessons,

266
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,230
and to not make the same mistake again.

267
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,600
<i>It wasn't easy for us to meet again.</i>

268
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,500
<i>It's not easy to meet for the second time.</i>

269
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's not miss out on each other this time, okay?

270
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,600
♫<i> I'm a little sad. Being around too many bright colors is very bitter. </i>♫

He Hao Yi,

272
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,800
you really are a good person, but I'm just not as positive as you are.

273
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,020
You've just forgotten that

274
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,200
I got all my good qualities from you.

275

I will send a puzzle to you. If you can solve it, then we will meet there tomorrow.

278
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,400
Why do you have to go to so much trouble?

279
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,800
Didn't you say you want us to be like a couple

280
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,100
who meets in a special place?

281
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,090

Okay then. See you tomorrow. Good night.

Oh, no. Did I guess wrong?

292
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
The lab journal.

293
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,200
<i>He Hao Yi,</i>

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,400

<i>Just think of it as the last present from me to you.</i>

297
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,600
<i>After going on a date with you, I realized that although 13 years had passed,</i>

298
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,800
<i>you could still live well without me.</i>

299
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,100
<i>Without you, I also lived well.</i>

300
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,300
<i>We don't need to pretend that we still care about each other.</i>

301
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:42,300
<i>From now on, I don't want to see you. Don't look for me.</i>

302
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,500
<i>After you take this, we are squared.</i>

303
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,400
<i>Thank you for letting me experience again the pure and happy feeling when I was 17.</i>

304

<i>He Hao Yi, goodbye.</i>

305
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,960
Do you really want to do this?

306
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I already gave the lab journal to He Hao Yi.

307
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,300
I don't want to do the research anymore.

Why?

309
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,760
You've worked so hard on this research ever since your college days.

310
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
Are you really an impetuous person?

311
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,400
I originally thought not.

312
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,560
In the past, I was the "garbage-truck girl."

313
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,990
I would take everything that nobody wanted.

314
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,420
If there was anything someone wanted, I would find a way to give it to them.

315
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,100
That was a long time ago, so I thought I had changed.

316
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,960
But when I met He Hao Yi, it was still the same.

317
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,190
Because he wanted the lab journal so much, so I gave it to him.

318
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,110
If you could give him that, then why can't you give him an opportunity?

319
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
These 13 years, I have watched over you.

320
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,000
You didn't cry or smile.

321
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
You were emotionless. You just suppressed yourself.

322
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
But after you met He Hao Yi, you started to smile.

323
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,600
He was the only one who could do this. And he is willing to do this for you now.

324
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,800
I really want to believe him,

325
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,740
but the one I can't believe is myself.

326
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,900
No matter what he does, I would be suspicious of him.

327
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,200
Whenever I see him, I worry about

328
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,800
if they would all leave me because of my little mistake.

329
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,220
So this time,

330
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,900
I want to be the first one to leave.

331
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:36,460
At the very least, he could get on the good side of me in my memories.

332
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,300
He Hao Yi is here.

333
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,000
You will help me, right?

334
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,500
You really...

335
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,180
<i>Ai Li Si, are you really sure you want to do this?</i>

336
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,900
<i>I thought you really liked He Hao Yi.</i>

337
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,000
I also originally thought this.

338
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,100
That's why I did a small experiment.

339
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
What experiment?

340
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,060
I went on a date with him.

341
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,200
<i>Then I realized that...</i>

342
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,280
I just wanted to fulfill the dream I had when I was 17.

343
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,210
That was to confess to him.

344
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,100
<i>He really treats you well right now.</i>

345
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,100
<i>So what?</i>

346
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
When I was 27, they didn't show up to retrieve the time capsule.

347
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I was sad, and I cried.

348
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,450
<i>Later, I pretended that nothing had happened.</i>

349
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,000
Right now, getting into a relationship

350
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
is a burden to me.

351
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,950
Then you still gave the lab journal to him?

352
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,100
<i>He wanted it, so I gave it to him. I can always start another research.</i>

353
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
If I keep the lab journal with me,

354
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,700
he would just keep pestering me.

355
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,100
But I don't want him to get close to me.

356
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,600
<i>It's annoying.</i>

357
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,900
He is really annoying!

358
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
He is annoying me to death!

359
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,600
♫<i> Where did the love between us fall off? </i>♫

360
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,600
♫<i> Even if this happiness we possess is just vain joy? </i>♫

361
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,570
♫<i> That shoulder you have leaned on is still here. </i>♫

362
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,000
♫<i> I begrudge your breath. </i>

363
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
♫<i> Where does this never vanished love fall off? </i>♫

364
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,200
♫<i> I keep searching without caring at all. </i>♫

365
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:53,800
♫<i> Some people will let a person forget himself, but also remember himself. </i>♫

366
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
♫<i> I really want to love you. To persist until the end, </i>♫

367
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,300
♫<i> tell me how much courage it requires. </i>♫

368
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,280
Are you back?

369
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,180
What's up?

370
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,230
Didn't you go to look for Ai Li Si? Why do you have such an expression?

371
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,340
There will be no Ai Li Si from now on.

372
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,760
What do you mean?

373
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,210
<i>He Hao Yi! Go on a date with me.</i>

374
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,990
<i>If I'm unreasonable to you today,</i>

375
00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:00,650
<i>just take it as a test for me to believe in you.</i>

376
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,120
<i>You'll always be here, right?</i>

377
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,820
<i>Even if I make you angry, you would still stay by my side. Am I right?</i>

378
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,120
<i>I just went on a date with him</i>

379
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,580
<i>to fulfill the dream I had when I was 17.</i>

380
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,930
<i>It's annoying.</i>

381
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,180
<i>He's really annoying!</i>

382
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,980
<i>He is annoying me to death!</i>

383
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,450
Why did you call me?

384
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,380
To drink with me. It looks like you can't drink.

385
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,890
I can't drink. If there is nothing, then I will go.

386
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,240
Hey!

387
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,080
Sit down.

388
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,480
How could you know without trying? Come on, try it.

389
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,800
No need.

390
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,460
What's wrong? Now, I'm out of the game.

391
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,380
So even you just want to ignore me?

392
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,440
What do you mean?

393
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,710
I heard the conversation between you and Ai Li Si at her home.

394
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,120
You drank too much. Go home and rest.

395
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,500
Do I really look like I'm drunk, huh?!

396
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,170
Why should I keep my head clear?

397
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,360
Even if I'm not sober, I don't know what Ai Li Si is thinking anyway. So why can't I get sober?

398
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,970
So many years have passed.

399
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,630
I thought Ai Li Si and I would have a chance to be together.

400
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,420
But in the end, it's just a one-sided wish from me.

401
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,350
So are you giving up?

402
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,480
Am I giving up? Good question. Let me ask myself.

403
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,770
It's still pounding. Help me feel it.

404
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,320
Stop it, okay?

405
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,890
- Stop it!<br>- Come on, just feel it.

406
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,440
It's still pounding.

407
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,870
But my brain is dead.

408
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,750
Do you know whose this is?

409
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,870
Whose is it?

410
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,020
- I don't know.<br>- How can you not know?

411
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,290
You clearly know everything. You're the only one who knows everything! Huh?!

412
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,330
Oh!

413
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,690
Something dropped.

414
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,200
Oh, I picked up a heart. Is it yours?

415
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,860
Yeah, how did you know? Are you alone?

416
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,450
Do I look like two people?

417
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,560
How humorous.

418
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
My name is Alice. What's your name?

419
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,260
- Alice? Like the Alice in "Alice in Wonderland"? <br>- Yes.

420
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,690
Could it be such a coincidence?

421
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,840
- Don't tell me you're called Alice, too?<br>- Yes, my name is also Alice.

422
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,020
You're also called Alice?!

423
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,350
Give me two glasses of wine. I'll treat these two Alices.

424
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,130
How great! He's treating us to drinks!

425
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,650
- How many Alices are here? Raise your hands!<br> - Here... !

426
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,270
I'll treat all Alices to drinks!

427
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,390
Why are you treating us to drinks?

428
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,200
- To Alice.<br> - Yeah. To Alice.

429
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,540
Let me tell you. I also knew an Alice (Ai Li Si).

430
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,510
13 years ago.

431
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,550
13 years ago?

432
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,730
What did the Alice from 13 years ago look like?

433
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,660
<i>That's right. What did she look like?</i>

434
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,280
Hey, Song Han Ming is over there. Let me take care of Ah Di myself.

435
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,580
Wait a minute. Let's take care of Ah Di first.

436
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,150
<i>- It's this person.<br>- That's her.</i>

437
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:55,770
Don't laugh anymore...

438
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,760
- I always missed my chance with her.<br>- Missed your chance? How come?

439
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,790
Only until today did I realize that...

440
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,740
it's all my fault.

441
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,840
How come? What happened?

442
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,130
It's just one mistake after another.

443
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,310
Okay, let's not talk about it anymore.

444
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,080
None of you can leave.

445
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,770
<i>- Okay, none of us will leave. Let's talk about her more.</i><br>- She was on the track and field team.

446
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,690
I could never catch up with her.

447
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,740
- I kept chasing her, but now I have no more energy to chase. <br>- Let's not talk about her. Let's drink.

448
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,310
I'm not going to chase her anymore...

449
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,960
- He Hao Yi, it's enough. Don't drink anymore!<br>- Ah Di!

450
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,160
Let's go home... !

451
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,230
Hey! Why are you two here? Let me introduce to you...

452
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:44,810
Eh... Alice from Shilin, Alice from Tianmu, and Alice from Gaoxiong.

453
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,150
Okay. Stop it.

454
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,840
So many Alices.

455
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,180
You're drunk. How can there be so many Alices?

456
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,630
Of the many Alices,

457
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,600
which of them is my Ai Li Si?

458
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,540
Where is Ai Li Si?

459
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,860
Your Ai Li Si is at home. Let's go home, okay?

460
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,490
Let's go home...

461
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,740
Which one is my Ai Li Si?

462
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,950
She's not here. Let's go.

463
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,870
- He Hao Yi!<br>- Hurry.

464
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,640
You're so heavy.

465
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,090
Why did this rotten Ah Di drink so much? He's trying to tire me to death.

466
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,610
Exactly!

467
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,280
I've never seen him drink so much.

468
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,660
He really never got drunk before. This is all because of her.

469
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:39,310
Seriously.

470
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,220
Ai Li Si...

471
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,370
Let's go.

472
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,870
Ah Di should be inside.

473
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,630
You go.

474
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,820
I don't want to.

475
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,570
You're his sister!

476
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,500
Just because I'm his sister, I can't say it.

477
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,820
Why can't you say it?

478
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,080
Then, what should we do?

479
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,150
<i>It was all because of you. That's why Ai Li Si hasn't come home yet.</i>

480
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,060
<i>What are you talking about? It's because you lack persuasion skills, okay?</i>

481
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,600
<i>Who was the one that got upset and said, "Let's go. Let's go," and then left?</i>

482
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,100
<i>I haven't contacted Ai Li Si for 13 years. How would I know how to deal with her?</i>

483
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,790
Have you guys had enough already?

484
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:01,290
Why do you guys have to be so loud?

485
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,880
Then think of a solution quickly.

486
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,070
<i>I can't think of any.</i>

487
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,630
<i>Ai Li Si, I really thought you liked He Hao Yi.<i></i></i>

488
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,490
<i>He is really annoying!</i>

489
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,760
<i>He is annoying me to death!</i>

490
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,980
Lei Lei and Xiao Fen,

491
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,860
you're really awesome!

492
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,790
Did he go crazy?

493
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,630
Anyway, we must have done something right.

494
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,020
♫<i> I can’t have your tenderness. </i>♫

495
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,360
<i>He Hao Yi, you idiot!</i>

496
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,740
<i>Why would they speak so loudly?</i>

497
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,460
<i>It's because they wanted me to hear it.</i>

498
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,920
<i>I actually got fooled by this little trick.</i>

499
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,590
<i>I'm really an idiot.</i>

500
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,890
<i>He Hao Yi, you idiot!</i>

501
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,520
<i>Ai Li Si must have her own reason to go to this degree.</i>

502
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,990
<i>But I'm a risk management professional.</i>

503
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,240
<i>Ai Li Si, don't underestimate me.</i>

504
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,420
CEO, the HR department has received Ai Li Si's resignation.

505
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,890
Ai Li Si resigned?

506
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:51,420
Why so suddenly?

507
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,930
Doesn't this mean we can have her hand over the lab journal?

508
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,810
If she says something to Capital, then it would be troublesome for us.

509
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,890
Then what should we do now?

510
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:18,080
For now, on one hand, we should see if she recovered her memory.

511
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,510
On the other hand, we must monitor the situation with Capital

512
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:26,480
to see whether they have the lab journal.

513
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,990
How should I find out if Ai Li Si recovered her memory?

514
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:49,050
♫<i> I want to go forward. I want to go backward. Oh~ </i>♫

515
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:57,050
♫<i> I really want to love you. To persist until the end, tell me how much courage it requires. </i>♫

516
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,150
Do you want some water?

517
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:34,030
Did you hand over the lab journal to Capital?

518
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,910
Not yet.

519
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,330
Why?

520
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,600
I will hand it over when I want to.

521
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,760
When will that be?

522
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,610
Wang Bo Jun's men are in Capital.

523
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,660
By then, he would know that you have the lab journal.

524
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,150
How did you know about Wang Bo Jun?

525
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,080
Because...

526
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,780
You don't need to know.

527
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:21,760
<i>I wanted the lab journal because of Ai Li Si.</i>

528
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,150
<i>If Ai Li Si doesn't continue with the experiment,</i>

529
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:27,160
<i>having the lab journal is useless.</i>

530
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,990
What happened?

531
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,030
It's none of your business.

532
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,010
I'm also involved in this matter.

533
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,700
If you don't tell me what happened, how am I going to settle this matter and protect myself?

534
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,430
You just need to pass them the lab journal.

535
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,690
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

536
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:16,080
I know you went back home. I'll call your mom.

537
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,270
<i>You have a registered mail. Thank you.</i>

538
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,100
<i>Your pen. Thank you.</i>

539
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,370
<i>Who sent this to you?</i>

540
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,150
<i>My ex-boss from my previous company.</i>

541
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,410
<i>Oh my goodness. Hey!</i>

542
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,580
<i>Why did your Boss send you a letter of attestation?</i>

543
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,140
<i>Did you have a falling out with him?</i>

544
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,880
CEO sent a letter of attestation to me.

545
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,930
He said the lab journal belongs to JSUT.

546
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,810
He wants me to return it back to the company.

547
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,290
If you don't return it back, they're going to sue you?

548
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,660
What does this have to do with you?

549
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,890
What do you mean by that?

550
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,580
After you gave me the lab journal, I have the responsibility to protect you.

551
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,790
I don't need your protection.

552
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,780
I mean in legal terms. I can't let them sue you.

553
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,630
This is a matter of professional ethics.

554
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,810
Even if I'm getting sued,

555
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,260
it has nothing to do with you at all.

556
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:46,620
So please, hand over the lab journal.

557
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:57,300
<i>Timing and subtitles brought to you<br>by the Forever17 Team@ Viki</i>

558
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,210
Ah Di?

559
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,230
What are you doing?!

560
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,820
What's up with you? You look like you're going to murder someone.

561
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,710
What's wrong?

562
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:40,140
I'm thinking about how to solve this crisis.

563
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,200
What crisis do you have again?

564
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,910
Wang Bo Jun sent a letter of attestation to Ai Li Si.

565
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,150
Why did he do that?

566
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,490
Because he wants Ai Li Si's lab journal.

567
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,250
This is the one.

568
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,940
He wants to find another investor so he can reap his own benefits.

569
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,960
I kept standing in his way so he couldn't prevail.

570
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,590
However, Ai Li Si suddenly resigned.

571
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,190
I think he figured out Ai Li Si has recovered her memory.

572
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,360
- That's why he sent an attestation letter to test her.<br>- What?!

573
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,340
What now then?

574
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,260
I need to devise a trap to lure Wang Bo Jun

575
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,970
so that he won't have the opportunity to threaten Ai Li Si anymore.

576
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:24,290
What trap? Have you thought of any?

577
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:32,680
It's like this...

578
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:39,070
♫<i> I want to go forward. I want to go backward. Oh~ </i>♫

579
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,800
♫<i> I really want to love you. To persist until the end, </i>♫

580
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,020
♫<i> tell me how much courage it requires. My only love. </i>♫

581
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,320
I need to devise a trap to lure Wang Bo Jun

582
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,110
so that he won't have the opportunity to threaten Ai Li Si anymore.

583
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,290
What trap? Have you thought of any?

584
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,410
It's like this...

585
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm proud of my Ah Di, who is indeed a crisis management expert.

586
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,490
He can even think of this strategy.

587
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:27,510
Now that we have a plan, we just need to find an investor.

588
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,760
An investor who can lure Wang Bo Jun to take the bait.

589
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,090
Once we have an investor like this in the fold,

590
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,400
Wang Bo Jun might just start to make his moves.

591
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,220
Investor...

592
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,150
This is simple.

593
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,970
I'll find my dad.

594
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:49,480
Oh, if your dad joins in, this plan will be even more complete.

595
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,800
However, Ai Li Si needs to willingly accept our help.

596
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,180
Oh!

597
00:56:56,180 --> 00:57:02,330
That's right. With her current situation, she definitely won't accept our help.

598
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,140
One of them is the Queen.

599
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,060
The other one is an expert of persuasion.

600
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,780
How can they be so useless?

601
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,350
Hey! What did you say? I am very useful!

602
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,310
That's right!

603
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:18,460
Then show me the Queen's resolve and your persuasion skills.

604
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,750
If you don't take this opportunity to prove to Ai Li Si that you are trustworthy friends, then when will you?

605
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,250
What's difficult about this?

606
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:28,510
That's right. I'll keep persuading her 'til she raises both hands and surrenders.

607
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:34,020
I'll let Ai Li Si know that we are her closest friends!

608
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,960
Ai Li Si!

609
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,350
We want to borrow some of your time.

610
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,580
I'm not free.

611
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,240
How can that be? You already resigned.

612
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,100
Also, staying at home all day isn't good for your health. Come with us for a walk.

613
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,150
Let's go.

614
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,000
What are you up to?

615
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,620
Do you remember in high school, we always gave you our bags?

616
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,250
Thanks!

617
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,460
<i>Liu Xiao Fen! Help bring my bookcase to the classroom.</i>

618
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,780
<i>I'm almost late for my morning swimming practice.</i>

619
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,030
<i>Give them to me. I'll help you bring them to the classroom.</i>

620
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,760
<i>Really? Thank you! </i>

621
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,330
<i>Love you! </i>

622
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,210
<i>Let's go. Hurry! </i>

623
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,920
Isn't it tiring for you to carry two school bags?

624
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,970
I forgot.

625
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,870
I don't have time to play these immature games with you.

626
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,660
Ai Li Si!

627
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,100
I admit that before, the two of us were extremely immature,

628
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,730
so that's why we casually ended friendships.

629
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,980
What do you mean?

630
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:18,530
It's that... We... That is... I...

631
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,970
Before I... I...

632
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:23,990
At that time, their EQ was at the level of kindergarteners.

633
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:27,070
Whoever became friends with them would be unlucky.

634
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,020
However, we have grown up now.

635
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:35,040
- If we can start over... <br> - We would definitely recycle you.

636
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,950
Recycle us.

637
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,940
I don't have time to deal with you guys. I don't have time to enjoy your two-person comic show, either.

638
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,080
Are you done talking?

639
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,910
Ai Li Si!

640
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:02,280
I suddenly feel really dizzy. I might be having a heat stroke.

641
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,000
Hurry, take me to a cool place.

642
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,060
I feel so hot. I'm dying.

643
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,620
You guys think this tactic will work?

644
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:25,950
Ai Li Si, you sure are quick on the uptake. You know that we are reminiscing.

645
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,580
Even if you turned this cold, you're still just as smart.

646
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:33,020
- Sis, enough. <br> - What?

647
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,490
Well, we're just reminiscing and enjoying some shaved ice together, right?

648
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,500
It's no use.

649
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,890
This place doesn't sell pudding anymore.

650
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,650
You know this, too?

651
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:52,980
Obviously, you still remember stuff from the past.

652
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,550
It's here.

653
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,530
This is your order of "Disintegration of Snow Mountain."

654
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,290
This is mine.

655
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,550
Please enjoy.

656
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,860
Thank you.

657
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,660
How can this... ?

658
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,620
It's good!

659
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,600
Although the Queen has grown up, she still enjoys special privileges.

660
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,560
Boss lady, thank you!

661
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,960
You're welcome!

666
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,010
- It's delicious!<br>- Yes.

667
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,320
Eat!

668
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,740
Try it and see if the flavor is the same as before.

669

If you don't eat it, I will.

670

01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,550
I ate it,

but I don't know if it tastes the same as what it did.

Even if I eat one more bite, it's no use.

01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,400
Because I forgot it.

681
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,920
I already gave you guys an answer. Can I leave?

682

Don't leave.

683
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:20,430
We should stop beating around the bush.

684
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:26,790
Actually, what I wanted to say is:

685
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:28,980
Ai Li Si, I'm sorry.

686
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,100
That year, because I didn't understand the situation well,

687
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,180
I shouldn't have misunderstood you, ignored you,

688
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,950
and let you go through so much hardship.

689
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,940
I really regret it.

690
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,660
I wasted thirteen years that I could've spent with you

691
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:59,940
going shopping, watching movies, enjoying afternoon tea,

692
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,110
and having heart-to-heart conversations.

693
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:07,950
Maybe you don't care anymore,

694
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:10,460
but I still want to say this.

695
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,980
Losing this friendship...

696
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,180
You're not the only one who feels upset.

697
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,580
I feel bad, too.

698
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,200
But just like you already know,

699
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,310
I'm pretty much a spoiled idiot.

700
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,810
I only know how to use anger to show my frustration.

701
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,480
I don't know how to tell you about my feelings.

702
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:50,180
But today, I have to tell you.

703
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:58,200
Ai Li Si, I'm really sorry.

704
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,920
Me, too. In the past, I only knew how to tease you,

705
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,490
and make fun of you.

706
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:12,360
I never tried to understand how you were feeling.

707
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,420
Now I know a true friend wouldn't treat someone like that.

708
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,530
Ai Li Si, I'm sorry.

709

It's useless.

712

It's too late.

713
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,980
We said so much but Ai Li Si still won't accept us.

714
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:06,090
But I felt that

715
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,470
her reaction was a bit different from before.

716
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,410
Ah Di, hurry up and go take a look.

717
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,540
Ai Li Si?

718
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,670
Ai Li Si...

719
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,820
Have you had enough?

720
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,100
I have more important things to do.

721
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,030
If you're planning on going to negotiate with Wang Bo Jun,

722
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,890
don't even think about it unless you're bringing me with you.

723
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,800
Don't you find yourself annoying?

724
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,230
Didn't I tell you not to meddle with my business?

725
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,900
I have a way of stopping Wang Bo Jun from blackmailing you.

726
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,050
But first, you must cooperate with me.

727
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,180
I told you to leave me alone!

728
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,990
Ai Li Si!

729
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,770
Actually, you don't have to push me away like this.

730
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:09,360
When you were talking to Song Han Ming the other day at your house,

731
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,960
I just so happened to be outside. So I heard everything I should have heard.

732
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:20,110
I know the 17-year-old you already said goodbye to your first love.

733
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:24,630
The 30-year-old you has absolutely no interest in me.

734
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,100
I am a crisis management expert,

735
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,690
so when I'm supposed to work hard, I will work hard.

736
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:38,470
When I'm supposed to give up, I will definitely not hesitate.

737
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,430
I won't keep pestering a girl who is not into me,

738
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:48,000
so you don't have to worry at all.

739
