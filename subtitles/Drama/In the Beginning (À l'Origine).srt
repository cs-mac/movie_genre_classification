1
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,733
In The Beginning

2
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,077
Based on a true story

3
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,496
Construction of a hypermarket

4
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:18,469
This is RPC.
We deal in office equipment.

5
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:22,845
Could I have the name
of your Logistics Manager

6
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:24,340
to send a catalogue?

7
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,185
Mr Miller... with 2 Ls.
Philippe Miller.

8
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,323
Can I ask who your supplier is

9
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,857
for equipment rental?

10
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:36,387
Point P, OK.

11
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,832
Hello.
I work with Philippe Miller from CGI

12
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,065
on the construction
of the hypermarket near Caudry.

13
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:51,534
Mrs Blondel gave me your name.

14
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:57,343
We need a tacheometer.
A GTS 239.

15
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,906
You got one?

16
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,375
Your surveyor know this one?

17
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,138
Yeah, I think so.

18
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,349
- When will you return it?
- End of the week.

19
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,043
Can you sign for it?

20
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,486
I'll be right back.

21
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,417
200 for the monitors,
500 for the instrument, OK?

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,865
These are a big hit.

23
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,463
I bought 'em

24
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,930
in Slovakia.

25
00:03:24,072 --> 00:03:26,006
They're rolling in it.

26
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,037
Fake pay slips.

27
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:33,437
I sell 'em to illegal aliens

28
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,309
along with rent slips.

29
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,340
So they can draw benefit.

30
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,848
It sells well.

31
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:08,571
Hello. This is BBL.
We rent office equipment.

32
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:13,343
Can I have the name
of your Logistics Manager?

33
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:15,116
Mr...?

34
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:16,819
Sorry, it's noisy in my office.

35
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,378
Thank you, ma'am.

36
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:01,163
Construction of Highway 61a

37
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,373
There were beetles everywhere.

38
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,417
So, the ecologists got
the construction stopped.

39
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,616
They staged demonstrations.
It was pretty scary.

40
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,655
Are you from CGI, too?

41
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,620
A guy from your firm
came last year.

42
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,291
He met with all the people
who'd lost their jobs.

43
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,003
He left and never came back.

44
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:40,933
I think it scared him.

45
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:42,706
Where can I buy cigarettes?

46
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,666
It's too late now around here.

47
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:47,639
I can help you out.

48
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:54,147
- Thanks. Here...
- It's OK, keep them.

49
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:57,251
I'm Monika. Goodnight.

50
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,524
You don't need anything else?

51
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:05,225
Oh, yes, there's a wedding,
so it may be a bit noisy.

52
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,466
That's all he said?

53
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:11,660
He said he's here
for the road works.

54
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:14,995
Shit!

55
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,603
Give me a hand here.

56
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:19,042
Tonight's my night off.

57
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:21,772
Lots of girls
would jump at the chance.

58
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:24,180
- Put it back.
- It's gross!

59
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,979
You're the one who cleans the floor!
Go on, get in there.

60
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:32,049
And don't sulk.
It has nothing to do with the guests.

61
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,565
I don't believe this!

62
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:14,833
What the hell!

63
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,862
You had stuff stolen, too?

64
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,303
And they've wrecked the door.
Oh, I don't believe it!

65
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,771
What about your car?

66
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,444
Same here.

67
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:26,144
- Come on.
- I'll join you.

68
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:08,787
Reception here.
There are 2 people to see you.

69
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:12,422
Did they say who they are?

70
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,163
I'm not pressing charges.

71
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,091
Should I ask if

72
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,222
it's the police?

73
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:21,761
I'm coming.

74
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,412
The 2 gentlemen
are in the dining room.

75
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:11,246
Go straight through.

76
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:20,920
Hello.

77
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,356
Do you have 5 minutes?

78
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,931
For a coffee.

79
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:39,047
- What can I get you?
- A coffee.

80
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:46,914
The manager of this place
is an old friend.

81
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,285
He told us
you arrived last night.

82
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:55,855
We decided
to come and see you directly.

83
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,297
Patrick and I

84
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:06,200
run a tool rental company here.

85
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,107
Since the work stopped 2 years ago,

86
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,684
we've had a really rough time.

87
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:21,281
We thought we had a chance
of getting the contract.

88
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,126
We got into debt
to buy new machines,

89
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:27,595
hire drivers, mechanics...

90
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,232
And at the last moment,
your predecessor

91
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,530
chose our rivals.

92
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:37,301
It was a disaster for us, of course.

93
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:39,706
Later on, we understood.

94
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:43,640
The site manager
worked in a rather...

95
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:48,644
He wanted something from us
he didn't get,

96
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:50,885
so we didn't do business.

97
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:54,855
He expected a pretty big "'discount"'.

98
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:59,926
So, if the work does restart,
we don't want to lose out again.

99
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,726
Sure.

100
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,567
We'd be prepared to go
as far as 15%/% "'discount"'.

101
00:12:08,574 --> 00:12:09,768
15%/%?

102
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:12,108
15%/% of the total amount.

103
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,174
That's a tidy sum in cash.

104
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,174
But it's up to you to tell us...

105
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,248
I see you've met.

106
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,614
We were discussing the beetles.

107
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:26,725
What a nightmare!

108
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:30,528
Those little beetles
decimated the whole region.

109
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,153
Thanks.

110
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,535
It's only that big,
but it's wiped out hundreds of jobs.

111
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,103
So, how long are you staying?

112
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,675
A day or two, no more.

113
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:45,071
You're just...

114
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,280
Just doing a status report.

115
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,641
That's something,
'cause they never cleaned up. See it?

116
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:51,973
Yeah.

117
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:54,647
Is your room alright?

118
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:56,787
Not too much noise last night?

119
00:12:57,091 --> 00:12:58,718
Sorry about your car.

120
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:00,026
It's only a window.

121
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:03,458
We'll leave you our card.

122
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:06,129
I'll add the cell number.

123
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,496
Hi.

124
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,667
I owe you these.

125
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:56,003
No need.

126
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,807
Time for a coffee?

127
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,848
5 minutes?

128
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,623
You work on Sundays, too?

129
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:11,861
Sometimes.

130
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,191
Been out and about?

131
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,690
- Coffee, please.
- Same here.

132
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:19,493
Normally, there are

133
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,068
less people at the fair.

134
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:23,938
He won't stop crying.

135
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,932
Philippe - Nicolas and Esteban.

136
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:28,533
Hello.

137
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,049
- Try the carousel.
- Too busy.

138
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,946
- Not seen Corinne?
- No.

139
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:35,845
I'll go, then.

140
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:37,848
Go with Mommy.

141
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:41,519
See you later.
You staying here? Back soon.

142
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:44,484
Can I sit here?

143
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,466
There were some things
in the car I want back.

144
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:56,967
The fake phone cards?

145
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,633
Can't even sell 'em.

146
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:01,771
You tried?

147
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:04,109
You a cop?

148
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:06,706
You afraid of cops?

149
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:09,744
And you?

150
00:16:13,257 --> 00:16:14,657
You're the talk of the town.

151
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,062
That you're here for the highway.

152
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,493
They don't waste any time.

153
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:24,466
Not with 25%/% unemployment here,
they don't.

154
00:16:26,038 --> 00:16:27,528
I can't find Corinne.

155
00:16:28,006 --> 00:16:29,200
Let's go, then.

156
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,437
To the carousel?

157
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:33,542
I'll get this.

158
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,078
I owe you that much.

159
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,920
Hello. Mr Miller from CGI here.

160
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:45,887
We met at the hotel earlier on.

161
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,550
I've thought it over.

162
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,586
Yes, you know, our agreement.

163
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:54,523
The money in cash...

164
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,196
I have to leave tonight for Lille.

165
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,898
Is tonight not possible?
Tomorrow morning?

166
00:17:03,476 --> 00:17:04,465
OK...

167
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,938
Very well.

168
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:13,978
Is it working?

169
00:17:15,455 --> 00:17:16,820
Can you hear me?

170
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:22,216
First of all, some cars
are badly parked.

171
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,655
They're blocking the road.

172
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:26,788
Please move them as soon as possible.

173
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,497
Hello, everyone.

174
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,134
Thank you for coming...

175
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,795
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

176
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:36,908
This year, the Town Hall
has joined forces

177
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:39,978
with the neighboring towns

178
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:44,581
for the raffle
to raise money for the elderly.

179
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:51,117
Let's now see
what the children have been up to.

180
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:54,820
This year, they were asked to create

181
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:59,023
costumes made entirely
from recyclable materials.

182
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,495
The winner of this competition

183
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,867
who will be known
as the Recycling King - or Queen -

184
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,167
will win a CD player
provided by the Town Hall.

185
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:14,811
The kids will come up one at a time.
Give them a big hand.

186
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,167
- Some mulled wine.
- Thanks.

187
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:35,735
It's not great!

188
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,834
Did you reach an agreement?

189
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:42,941
We'll see.

190
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:46,612
They're good guys.
You'll come to an understanding.

191
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:55,647
This is Mr Miller.

192
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,286
You're eagerly awaited, you know.

193
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:01,155
He arrived last night.

194
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:03,560
I'm fully aware of that.
I'm Stéphane.

195
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:08,363
Let's go somewhere quieter.

196
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,207
People look happy, don't they?

197
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,104
If I tell them who you are,

198
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:16,711
they'll ask you to go on stage.

199
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,338
Should I tell them? No?

200
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:20,842
They won't eat you!

201
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,280
Let's go to the Town Hall.

202
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:26,752
I'll tell Michel.

203
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,090
I'll shut the door.

204
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,889
Sit yourself down.

205
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:35,864
We do weddings here.

206
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,360
Don't be scared!

207
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:40,133
We're really pleased to see you.

208
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,703
So, you're here to do a status report?

209
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:43,962
That's right.

210
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:46,741
OK. And what exactly does that mean?

211
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:50,704
I meet people...

212
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:55,216
I see how things are going.

213
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,150
Try to see clearly...

214
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:00,415
That kinda thing.

215
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:04,017
They didn't tell us 2 years ago
that work would stop.

216
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,255
Now they don't tell us it might restart.
Very strange.

217
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,664
I understand.

218
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,493
Well, I do what I'm told.
You know, it's...

219
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:16,101
You mustn't...

220
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:18,531
What are you told?

221
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:23,212
To come and see how...

222
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,818
in what condition the site is in...
To meet people...

223
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:32,986
Have you seen the site?

224
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:35,020
Of course.

225
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:36,888
There was the drainage problem.

226
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:41,257
It's not building land, so that's...

227
00:20:41,832 --> 00:20:43,766
That's nothing to worry about.

228
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,027
It's not a problem.

229
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,327
In any case,
they haven't forgotten us.

230
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:49,631
That's good.

231
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:52,775
- No...
- So, there's hope.

232
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,416
I'm afraid I can't stay.

233
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,540
We've had to

234
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:05,019
provide access for the farmers
who work the land.

235
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:06,987
Don't forget the farmers.

236
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:10,627
Could you take
the new plans back with you?

237
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,692
I'll go get the copies.

238
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,090
I'm sorry...

239
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,164
but I really can't stay.

240
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,071
How can we reach you?

241
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,968
Can you leave your card?

242
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:27,101
I have nothing on me.
Someone broke into my car last night.

243
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:29,670
I'm very sorry.

244
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:31,782
We don't know how to contact you.

245
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,885
Are you staying in the area?

246
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:38,918
Philippe, can't you go after him?

247
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:41,552
- He's gone?
- Yes.

248
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:46,158
He just follows orders.
He's not in charge.

249
00:21:47,933 --> 00:21:50,163
He can't say too much, but

250
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,561
he's here for a reason.

251
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:55,830
They could at least send
someone competent.

252
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,033
Maybe there are things he can't tell us.

253
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,147
The jerk was lost for words.

254
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:04,973
Don't say that.
You sound like a tribunal.

255
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:06,685
Where's he come from?

256
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,516
He's from Head Office,
but he does look lost.

257
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:15,788
He seems very dull,
unable to string a sentence together.

258
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,924
A bit pathetic.

259
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:21,190
- Got anything else?
- No.

260
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,930
I want to ask you something.
I know it's not done...

261
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:30,870
It's my résumé.

262
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:35,278
I thought
you might be hiring people.

263
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,644
Times are hard.

264
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,275
You did 3 years at college?

265
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,711
Yeah, I'm still refunding the loan.

266
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,218
I got a technical sales diploma.

267
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:48,552
Then, I did some bookkeeping
in a garage.

268
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,253
Why stay in this hole?

269
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,822
It didn't use to be a hole.

270
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,161
And I was born here,
and there's Nicolas and the kid...

271
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:01,568
I'm not going to move
to go in search of work

272
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,271
or we'll all live in China.

273
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,745
And I work in the sugar refinery

274
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,777
during the beet harvest.

275
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:13,151
I just do shitty jobs
in shopping malls and such.

276
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:15,081
That's life.

277
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:19,987
You coming down for dinner?

278
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:21,856
No, I have work to do.

279
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,251
I can bring something.

280
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:24,557
I'm not hungry.

281
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:27,061
You won't mention my résumé?

282
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,036
Don't worry.

283
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:31,094
Goodnight.

284
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:47,279
There'll be more next time.

285
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,648
- How much is there?
- 5,000.

286
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,055
It's all we could get so fast.

287
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:53,954
Is that OK for now?

288
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,790
That's OK.

289
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,162
Here's a list of our equipment.

290
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:01,492
It corresponds
to what was needed last time.

291
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:05,067
We can give you
further info by phone.

292
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:06,264
I'll phone you.

293
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,176
Sorry about yesterday.
It wasn't very...

294
00:24:09,744 --> 00:24:11,212
But people here suffered.

295
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:16,879
If every supplier does this,

296
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,078
you'll rake in a small fortune.

297
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:28,119
Here are details of a friend
who rents vans.

298
00:24:28,264 --> 00:24:30,698
He's open to discussion, too.

299
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,296
Keep in touch.

300
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:48,241
That guy left this for you.

301
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,530
Why did he give you that?

302
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,931
I don't know.
They didn't charge him...

303
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:08,831
D'you sleep with him?

304
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:14,173
We need the money.

305
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:24,945
No, I didn't.

306
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:29,954
Not everyone is a slimeball.

307
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:33,824
Yeah, sure!

308
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,471
Mr Miller?

309
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,510
I was not impressed.

310
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,810
- I...
- Who d'you think you are?

311
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,318
People like you...
think you can judge me!

312
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,783
Listen.

313
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:05,061
I travel a lot.
I meet a lot of people.

314
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,358
People like you are alone.

315
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,558
You look all alone.

316
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,736
Mr Miller, please don't go.

317
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,547
I'm just a jerk!

318
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,674
- Don't go.
- Ajerk, isn't that right?

319
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,702
He was sleeping.

320
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,905
Thanks, Corinne. I'm sorry.

321
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,517
Is Nicolas home?

322
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,984
He's not back...

323
00:27:04,524 --> 00:27:05,752
I'll stay with you.

324
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,524
Go to sleep now.

325
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,400
One day, the cops
will find him dead somewhere.

326
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,467
He has good shit though!

327
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,033
That's the problem.

328
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,705
Yeah, that's the problem!

329
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:33,181
Don't worry, we'll build that highway
and get the hell outta here.

330
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,481
To highways!

331
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:58,344
Initially, I just need to establish
a base to prepare things.

332
00:27:58,612 --> 00:27:59,544
A base?

333
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,614
You mean a platform
at the entrance

334
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,115
to store the machines,
equipment, etc?

335
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:05,817
Yeah, a platform.

336
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:10,680
Do you have the plans
or should we use the old ones?

337
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:13,552
- We should go take a look.
- Sure.

338
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:15,459
Ah, the coffee!

339
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:18,995
What's the link between CGI and you?

340
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:22,068
I know they keep
adding subsidiaries, but...

341
00:28:22,636 --> 00:28:24,570
It all belongs to CGI.

342
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:27,938
You have agreements
with the holding company.

343
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:32,743
My associates and I try
to have a structure

344
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,473
that's flexible enough

345
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:38,009
to let us stay in touch
with grass-roots reality.

346
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:40,382
You're not GTM?

347
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:41,819
You're GMT.

348
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,990
GMT R. "'R"' for "'roads"'.

349
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,595
Jamel handles schedules.

350
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,501
CGI has 1,700 subsidiaries

351
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:56,632
with branches all over the world.

352
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,766
And it keeps changing.

353
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,807
They asked me to do this,

354
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:03,774
among other things.

355
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:05,975
It's a tough task.

356
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:08,048
But we're here to help.

357
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,675
But civil engineering in France

358
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:13,481
is a headache
for companies like ours.

359
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:17,184
It's true,
it's so closely monitored nowadays.

360
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,189
In fact, we lose money on it.

361
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,990
Is that right?

362
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,400
We don't know
about that kind of thing.

363
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:27,525
We're just struggling to survive.

364
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,938
What about your equipment needs?

365
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:32,200
We'll need a copy

366
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,100
of the schedule asap.

367
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:38,072
First, I want to see
your estimation.

368
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,478
You must have quotes and plans?

369
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:42,481
Here you are.

370
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:46,120
If you need more equipment,
we'll manage.

371
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:47,811
OK.

372
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,825
But in the meantime,
how do we get in touch with you?

373
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:55,689
We don't have a thing.
Do you have a card?

374
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:01,435
Look at the state
it was delivered in.

375
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:04,435
Let's call Michel -
he'll reprint it in no time.

376
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:07,099
He'll be interested
in working with you.

377
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,136
He can reuse the logo.

378
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,571
What're you doing
for lunch, Mr Miller?

379
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,108
Call me Philippe.

380
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,222
This is it.

381
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:33,467
It was a packaging firm.

382
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,964
Now it belongs to the town,

383
00:30:36,106 --> 00:30:39,735
but we can't afford to refurbish it.

384
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:42,840
The site isn't far. I thought...

385
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,776
I don't know what you need.

386
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:48,851
It's not too run-down.

387
00:30:51,022 --> 00:30:54,549
Even a kitchen...
We'll help you clean up.

388
00:30:56,494 --> 00:30:59,190
I'll see to the power
and insurance.

389
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:02,056
Why did they leave?

390
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,896
They relocated to Croatia.

391
00:31:05,603 --> 00:31:07,434
Can't you do anything?

392
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,636
What can we do?

393
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:14,105
Near here, there was
a textiles factory. 800 jobs.

394
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:18,538
The boss went to India
with the machines and our subsidies.

395
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,176
We're left with the jobless.

396
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:29,016
I phoned your office.

397
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:30,955
They didn't tell me.

398
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,961
They couldn't find you.

399
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,158
I have little contact with them.

400
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:40,934
I said I was a mayor
concerned by the project.

401
00:31:41,273 --> 00:31:44,902
I just got
one voice mail after another.

402
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:46,067
Happens all the time.

403
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,701
Especially with me.

404
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:50,610
We tried in vain
to sue them 2 years ago.

405
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,748
The main thing is, you're back.

406
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,993
You have to give priority
to local firms.

407
00:32:05,764 --> 00:32:08,495
The suppliers, hotels...
I'm counting on you.

408
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,134
Going well, isn't it?

409
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,828
Just fine.

410
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:14,696
They've suffered.

411
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:16,735
I know.

412
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,576
You know...

413
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,605
Call me on this number.

414
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,071
There you are.

415
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:29,553
The CGI's offices were 15 miles away.
We never saw them.

416
00:32:29,856 --> 00:32:32,222
People will be reassured
that you're here.

417
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
See you soon.

418
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:38,663
- Call me, OK?
- Sure.

419
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,885
ACCOUNTS

420
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:16,266
Hi, how are you?

421
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:19,604
He hired you?

422
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,107
I don't know. We're helping out
for now, then we'll see.

423
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:27,875
So, with the drivers,
that makes a team of 34 people.

424
00:33:28,248 --> 00:33:29,909
Here are their résumés.

425
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:35,250
We could have a global wages contract
with payment at 90 days.

426
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,414
Then, we'll see.

427
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,049
What can you give me on that?

428
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,863
Patrick said your rate is 15%/%.

429
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,659
Can you get it by Friday?

430
00:33:48,503 --> 00:33:49,663
In cash?

431
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:56,910
The more people you hire,

432
00:33:57,045 --> 00:34:00,208
the higher the commission

433
00:34:00,648 --> 00:34:02,047
for both of us?

434
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:03,573
Of course.

435
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,783
We need people to direct
heavy vehicles at junctions.

436
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,526
You need to contact
the agency direct.

437
00:34:14,662 --> 00:34:15,686
Sorry...

438
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:22,061
The Town Hall asked him
to hire locals,

439
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:23,603
so try your luck.

440
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,473
What do you do?

441
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm a driver, but I'm not sure
I want to do it.

442
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,018
Hello, this is GMTR
about the work resuming.

443
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,685
Mr Miller asked me to call you

444
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:42,552
to draw up the rental contracts.

445
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,955
It's payment at 90 days.

446
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,618
No, not 30 days.

447
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:49,488
Yes, Mr Miller spoke to them.

448
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,840
Rosemonde here will be helping out.
She's a retired secretary.

449
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,508
I thought she'd be useful.

450
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:05,681
Have you worked in construction?

451
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:07,213
Yes, a bit.

452
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:11,011
Thank you, sir.

453
00:35:11,054 --> 00:35:14,046
This is your desk.
All the papers are here.

454
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,688
- Who's his foreman?
- The one in charge.

455
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,185
- There's just temps.
- That's weird.

456
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,121
I won't give him 10%/% in advance.

457
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:24,627
Nor me.
I got taken for a ride before.

458
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,966
I'll pick up the contract
from your office.

459
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:33,766
Nice car...

460
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:38,874
I've been loaned it for now.

461
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:40,983
Why for now?

462
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,136
Can you sign these?

463
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,870
And who do I call
to get the company checkbooks?

464
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,507
They'll be here.

465
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,114
Do I call the agency for an advance?

466
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:14,676
I don't deal with that.
The agency writes the checks.

467
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,154
Thanks.

468
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,097
No need for a tie.

469
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:49,720
I'm meeting Mr Miller.

470
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:51,880
Are you the foreman?

471
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:53,787
- Louis.
- Nicolas.

472
00:36:53,926 --> 00:36:55,052
Is he here?

473
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:57,153
Over there.

474
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:04,930
We're better off here
than where they were 2 years ago.

475
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:08,934
We'll get the Town Hall
to redirect the minor road.

476
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,439
Never worked with GMTR.
Where were you before?

477
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:18,907
Drop the chitchat, OK?

478
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,612
Whatever you say.

479
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:24,717
I spent a long time abroad.

480
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:30,725
Tell us what to do
or I'll make suggestions.

481
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:31,921
Fine by me.

482
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,159
Hurry up, we're running late.

483
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:09,061
More champagne!

484
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,965
- Where's the boss?
- He'll be here.

485
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,845
What's going on?

486
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,209
They're getting ready for Monday.

487
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,852
They're giving you a warm welcome.

488
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,055
It's party time!

489
00:38:52,514 --> 00:38:54,038
Speech! Speech!

490
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,097
I'm not very good at making speeches.

491
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,103
A big thank you...

492
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,405
to the suppliers.

493
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,174
And also...

494
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,814
that...

495
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:37,016
I just want to say thank you
to Mr Miller

496
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,684
for all he's done for us,

497
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,519
for the local firms...

498
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:46,731
Since work stopped 2 years ago,
things have been hard.

499
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:49,996
Many of you felt abandoned

500
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:52,470
and were losing hope.

501
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:55,839
Now you've found fresh hope

502
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:58,776
and you feel, as I do,
that there is a path,

503
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,176
a way... a highway!

504
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,713
You get there quicker!

505
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,924
And it'll lead us to a better future.

506
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:11,420
A road is always the start
of an adventure.

507
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:15,490
And I hope that this second chance
will be the right one.

508
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,198
To second chances!

509
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,252
Am I disturbing you?

510
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:39,978
No.

511
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:46,326
I wanted to thank you,
but I thought it'd embarrass you.

512
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:49,764
Men like me
are no good at politics.

513
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,897
You do realize that I'm a woman?

514
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,567
My job...

515
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,572
has very little to do with politics.

516
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:03,942
I just try to help people
as best I can.

517
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:16,951
This is the road
in cross-section, in slices...

518
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:21,494
The first stage is the machines
scraping the surface.

519
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,894
The soil...
Then we treat the earth.

520
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:28,632
And we put asphalt on top.

521
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,877
How many people, in the end? 40?

522
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:44,450
- About 50.
- Good.

523
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,320
Thank you.

524
00:41:46,558 --> 00:41:48,253
Excuse me. Someone to see you.

525
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:57,530
Know what they used to write
on old nautical charts?

526
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,461
There was a line

527
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:03,371
and it said: "'Beyond this limit,
we enter unknown territory"'.

528
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,534
See you soon.

529
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:10,712
Want a drink?

530
00:42:11,149 --> 00:42:12,207
No, thank you.

531
00:42:12,818 --> 00:42:14,878
- Do I sign everything?
- Yes.

532
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:17,786
Where's your family?

533
00:42:21,227 --> 00:42:22,956
I have a son and an ex-wife.

534
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:25,993
Does she work?

535
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,494
Why do you ask?

536
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:32,329
Don't know.

537
00:42:32,572 --> 00:42:35,302
The problems start
when you lose your job.

538
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:41,279
Let's just say...

539
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:44,646
we've drifted apart.

540
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:47,842
That all you'll say?

541
00:42:55,628 --> 00:42:56,789
Doesn't matter.

542
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:01,058
Weather forecast?

543
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:02,960
Stable till tonight.

544
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:06,431
Start excavation work
over 100 yards.

545
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:09,640
Get to it before the storm comes.

546
00:43:39,873 --> 00:43:41,967
Construction of Highway 61a

547
00:44:21,149 --> 00:44:23,083
They've made good progress.

548
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:26,082
The slopes are done and all.

549
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:37,395
Hi. Alright?

550
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,392
Pascal. Works with me.

551
00:44:39,669 --> 00:44:41,364
Here's the schedule.

552
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:44,129
2 men didn't come today.
I replaced them,

553
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:48,009
but I asked Monika to find others.
It's gonna be tight.

554
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:49,673
Let's take a look.

555
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,981
Louis, is it OK to park there?

556
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:56,948
The parking lot's back there.

557
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,092
The plans don't correspond to ours.

558
00:45:07,397 --> 00:45:09,831
I suggest we use ours,
'cause if we wait,

559
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:13,493
the rain will be here by tonight
or tomorrow morning.

560
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,062
It's very slimy clay.

561
00:45:15,205 --> 00:45:19,437
So, the vehicles will get stuck
and we'll have to stop work.

562
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,508
Is that OK?

563
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:23,007
I'll be right back.

564
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:27,006
Gaby!

565
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:01,109
You OK, guys?

566
00:46:04,822 --> 00:46:06,687
Pascal, call the water company.

567
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:08,583
- What did you do?
- Dunno.

568
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,955
No, it's water, not gas.

569
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,857
Looks like we hit a pipe.

570
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,060
What do we do?

571
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:28,637
We need pumps.

572
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,441
Got any pumps?

573
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:32,776
C'mon, men, go get water pumps.

574
00:47:03,015 --> 00:47:06,382
I have a form for you to sign
for the water pumps.

575
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,645
It's urgent. There's a flood.

576
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,311
We need to talk.

577
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:13,682
- Still no checkbooks?
- Keep giving out order forms.

578
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:15,553
The small firms can't wait.

579
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:17,522
Tell 'em to call me.

580
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:19,263
You're hard to reach.

581
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:21,330
Hey, guys!

582
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,202
Come eat with us.

583
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:26,765
I got an appointment.

584
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,994
He didn't say
if he wanted weekly meetings?

585
00:47:50,296 --> 00:47:51,354
No.

586
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,723
Isn't it strange
that no-one's come from CGI?

587
00:47:56,236 --> 00:47:58,363
He said they're coming next week.

588
00:47:58,838 --> 00:47:59,897
Well, we'll see.

589
00:48:03,444 --> 00:48:05,844
Why have you stayed a foreman?

590
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,048
I get paid nice n' regular.

591
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,782
I got enough trouble
with a wife n' kids.

592
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:14,015
How do I get hired?

593
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,316
Look n' learn. We'll see.

594
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:21,454
Let's go.
It'll start raining any minute.

595
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:11,506
It's Louis. We hit a water pipe.

596
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:15,375
It's like a lake here.
We've lost 2 days.

597
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:18,786
I've added a pump.
The first was too small.

598
00:49:19,487 --> 00:49:21,546
Do you think
we should go around it?

599
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,984
What do you think?

600
00:49:23,425 --> 00:49:26,884
I think we should.
It's sunny now, but it won't last.

601
00:49:27,196 --> 00:49:28,561
It's gonna pour soon.

602
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:31,667
We'll do that?
OK, I'll deal with it.

603
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:49,579
See you.

604
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:54,651
I left you 3 messages.

605
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:04,199
The suppliers agreed
to be paid at 90 days.

606
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,224
That's 3 months.

607
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:08,398
What date's that?

608
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:10,436
November 28.

609
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,634
So, officially,
we don't owe anything till then.

610
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,506
Should I write it down?

611
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,679
No, it's OK.

612
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,252
What time do you finish?

613
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,421
Around midnight.

614
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,359
It's OK.
I just have to get into the groove.

615
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,357
I'm quitting soon, anyway.

616
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,524
You should've told me.

617
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,431
Don't worry, it's my problem.

618
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,473
Will you give Nicolas a job?
It'd calm him down.

619
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,844
If you're alone at night,
you can call us.

620
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,456
Bye... boss!

621
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:39,623
Article 215: The spouses
share in their estate.

622
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:43,234
Lastly, the parents
consult their child

623
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:45,529
on decisions
which concern him or her.

624
00:51:46,572 --> 00:51:49,973
So, Barbara and Michel,
I wish you every happiness.

625
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,815
You can kiss now!

626
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:05,553
I went to the site.
They said you had an appointment.

627
00:52:05,724 --> 00:52:06,816
Probably.

628
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:11,262
Do you go home at weekend?

629
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,754
Rarely.

630
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:17,497
With all that traveling,
don't you get lonely?

631
00:52:19,772 --> 00:52:21,433
It's only for a while.

632
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:26,308
You do it to earn money,
then you move on.

633
00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:28,013
If you can...

634
00:52:30,383 --> 00:52:31,680
Are you from here?

635
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,351
Oh, no, my parents are from Lyon.

636
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:37,815
I came here with my husband.

637
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,728
Actually, I'm a widow.
It's been 5 years now.

638
00:52:45,765 --> 00:52:47,995
My husband was the mayor.

639
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:52,297
I was in charge of the charities
and I bred horses.

640
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,433
When he died,
people asked me to take over.

641
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:58,243
My daughter studied far away,
so I did.

642
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:00,709
You live alone?

643
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:04,774
Yes, I try to. And you?

644
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:06,778
No...

645
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:08,847
No, I...

646
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:15,557
You like to scare people, don't you?
It's your thing, huh?

647
00:53:17,798 --> 00:53:18,924
Do I scare you?

648
00:53:19,733 --> 00:53:22,327
I don't know. Just enough...

649
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,493
This way.

650
00:53:29,376 --> 00:53:32,812
You can go the other way,
but I like this way.

651
00:53:49,197 --> 00:53:50,664
It's from a Russian icon.

652
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,261
Well, we're not really sure.

653
00:53:54,569 --> 00:53:56,230
We're carrying out research.

654
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:59,404
Or rather I am,
because no-one else cares.

655
00:54:01,943 --> 00:54:05,936
It's not very valuable,
but it's better here than in a museum.

656
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,975
It makes a change
from neighborhood quarrels.

657
00:54:11,686 --> 00:54:14,246
I like coming here.
It has something.

658
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,357
Who pays for all this?

659
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:22,456
The local communities.
It doesn't matter.

660
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:27,165
Why do you always ask
who pays?

661
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:30,905
Do you like the colors?

662
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:35,709
I wouldn't know.

663
00:54:39,982 --> 00:54:42,212
I'm supposed to have stopped...

664
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:45,712
I like to smoke when it's cold.

665
00:54:46,422 --> 00:54:47,912
Do you want to...

666
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,621
There's a bowling alley...

667
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:54,387
A bowling alley!

668
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,361
You want to take me bowling?!

669
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,467
Isn't that a bit crazy?

670
00:55:01,537 --> 00:55:03,334
You like bowling, do you?

671
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:06,441
I never go.
I was just saying...

672
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:12,778
I've never met anyone like you.

673
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,246
Mom?

674
00:55:53,623 --> 00:55:55,181
I'm in my room, honey.

675
00:55:55,325 --> 00:55:57,988
I'm with Denis.
I'm taking the car. Bye.

676
00:55:58,796 --> 00:55:59,888
Bye.

677
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,495
It's all fake...

678
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:00,888
We'll have to stop tomorrow.

679
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:02,856
It's not in the estimate
or the schedule.

680
00:57:02,995 --> 00:57:04,758
It's decision time.

681
00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,657
I'll tell you tonight, OK?

682
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:11,696
You said that last time.

683
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,138
It's your responsibility.

684
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:50,070
It's me.

685
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:54,411
I wanted to talk to you.

686
00:57:55,882 --> 00:57:57,747
To say I feel good with you.

687
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,111
I won't hurt you.

688
00:58:41,362 --> 00:58:42,659
What's going on?

689
00:58:43,063 --> 00:58:45,657
I tried to repair the car.
I cut my hand.

690
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:48,498
Then, my cell fell in the water.

691
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:49,965
It's pissing blood.

692
00:58:50,138 --> 00:58:51,537
What're you doing here?

693
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:55,507
You asked me to get fencing
to put in front of the office.

694
00:58:55,944 --> 00:58:58,538
It's all in the trunk,
but the car broke down.

695
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,511
Got a cloth?
I'll bleed all over.

696
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:18,631
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, it's OK.

697
00:59:19,868 --> 00:59:20,857
Thanks.

698
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,904
It's not serious.

699
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,558
Monika's a bit in love with you.

700
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:46,654
I don't think she is.

701
00:59:48,097 --> 00:59:51,897
Not surprising, with all that's happened
since you came.

702
00:59:55,171 --> 00:59:57,833
Funny thing,
changing people's lives, huh?

703
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:00,735
Don't you think?

704
01:00:06,115 --> 01:00:08,083
The kid isn't my son.

705
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:10,014
I love him, but he's not mine.

706
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:13,044
I don't know
who or where his dad is.

707
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:14,912
He did a runner

708
01:00:15,057 --> 01:00:17,618
when Monika was pregnant.

709
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,695
I do what I can to help.

710
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:26,225
My dad

711
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:30,495
spent his life telling me
I was a useless idiot.

712
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:35,008
He died
before I could spit in his face.

713
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,208
What do you want to say?

714
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:43,916
Your scams with the suppliers
are no business of ours.

715
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:47,548
No-one'll come asking about it.

716
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:50,023
As long as we get paid,
we don't care.

717
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,695
It's better than nothing.

718
01:00:57,868 --> 01:00:59,199
What do you want?

719
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:02,606
Dough?

720
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:04,574
Money?

721
01:01:06,544 --> 01:01:08,637
I don't give a shit about money.

722
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:10,780
I know where to find it.

723
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,617
What counts is
that we all achieve something.

724
01:01:15,987 --> 01:01:17,579
You understand that?

725
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:21,919
Or you wouldn't be here.

726
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:27,723
What're you gonna do?

727
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:30,431
Get your gun out? Then what?

728
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:33,563
Where will you go?

729
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:39,667
Sit down. Let's have a drink...
Sorry about that.

730
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:47,846
Finally!

731
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:50,152
Feel better?

732
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:56,522
We're trying to have a baby.

733
01:01:59,732 --> 01:02:01,825
Think I'd make a good father?

734
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,730
Be honest.

735
01:02:06,138 --> 01:02:07,162
"'Boss"'!

736
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,670
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

737
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:14,172
A big crowd tonight.

738
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:18,007
Over 300 people. Thank you

739
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:21,777
for coming to the grand final.

740
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:27,189
It shows how interested you are
in handball.

741
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,187
Before we start...

742
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:37,468
Before we start the game,

743
01:02:37,604 --> 01:02:41,472
I want you to give
a very warm welcome

744
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:44,036
to the mayors
of tonight's two towns.

745
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:47,078
Mr Jaudon,
Mayor of Barsac

746
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,848
and Mrs Stéphane Arnaud
of St Berto!

747
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:51,516
A big hand!

748
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,723
Sports events like these

749
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,589
would not go ahead
without sponsors.

750
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:06,961
I call on Mr Barracher,
Manager of the Banque Populaire.

751
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:18,168
Last but not least,
Mr Philippe Miller of GMTR.

752
01:03:18,479 --> 01:03:21,846
As you know,
he has restarted the road works.

753
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:25,380
He's the man who saved us.
Mr Philippe Miller

754
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,510
of GMTR!

755
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,526
It's now time for the game.

756
01:03:37,665 --> 01:03:40,725
Give a big hand to the two teams!

757
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:06,820
I'm from the paper.
I keep calling you.

758
01:04:06,962 --> 01:04:10,159
You must give some time
for the article I'm writing.

759
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:36,787
I didn't think it'd go like this.

760
01:04:40,129 --> 01:04:41,687
It's not what I planned.

761
01:04:42,064 --> 01:04:43,531
What do you mean?

762
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,028
What did you plan?

763
01:04:52,608 --> 01:04:55,042
You don't plan things -
you let them happen.

764
01:04:58,147 --> 01:05:01,116
Did you just need me
for your damn road works?

765
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:04,917
Is that all this was about?

766
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:08,120
This feels wrong.

767
01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:09,417
I think you've lived alone too long.

768
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:22,093
I've wasted so much time.

769
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:45,047
The guy with the water pump
wants a check or cash.

770
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:50,060
The order forms won't work anymore.

771
01:06:53,165 --> 01:06:54,723
People are talking.

772
01:06:55,701 --> 01:06:57,999
They don't want
to be conned again.

773
01:06:59,872 --> 01:07:01,396
I won't let 'em down.

774
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,840
What about those damn checkbooks?

775
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,768
Where's Nicolas?

776
01:07:07,646 --> 01:07:09,443
He didn't come home last night.

777
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:14,645
- I'll call him.
- It doesn't concern you. Enough!

778
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:39,871
Hello. I'm Mr Barracher
from the Banque Populaire.

779
01:07:41,915 --> 01:07:42,882
OK!

780
01:07:43,216 --> 01:07:44,513
Come with me.

781
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:48,050
It's quicklime,
to dry out the ground.

782
01:07:48,188 --> 01:07:50,782
Mind your eyes now.

783
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:56,885
Then, it hardens
and the road rollers can get to work.

784
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,498
Then, the asphalt.
I'll show you.

785
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,294
Your first time?

786
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:04,764
Yes. I usually visit small farms.

787
01:08:05,071 --> 01:08:06,265
Look at this.

788
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:09,632
If it rains now,
we have to start over.

789
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:22,052
I don't understand. Your company
is a subsidiary of a huge group.

790
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,879
Yeah.

791
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:28,127
I run a little country branch.
I know nothing about all that.

792
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:31,894
I'm not talking
about the project as a whole.

793
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:34,567
Just a small temporary problem

794
01:08:34,702 --> 01:08:36,294
of petty cash.

795
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:39,829
Wait a minute...

796
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:43,243
Your company
must have a bank, accounts...

797
01:08:43,544 --> 01:08:45,307
There's a whole structure.

798
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,814
Yes, but in the meantime,
I still don't have a checkbook. Sugar?

799
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:57,547
Can you give me a ballpark figure?

800
01:08:58,293 --> 01:09:00,818
It's not a great deal.

801
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:03,954
The electricity bill,
office supplies...

802
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:06,632
Around 25,000 euros.

803
01:09:07,202 --> 01:09:09,830
Yes, proportionally, that's not much.

804
01:09:15,043 --> 01:09:17,375
So, you just want to open an account

805
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,274
to pay your immediate expenses.
It's a cash flow problem.

806
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:22,845
Exactly.

807
01:09:29,157 --> 01:09:30,215
What about the wages?

808
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:33,125
No, the agency deals with that.

809
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:35,889
There's no problem with that
till the 28th.

810
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:41,136
You saw the site
yet I can't even write checks for fuel!

811
01:09:43,272 --> 01:09:44,603
Indeed.

812
01:09:49,178 --> 01:09:53,046
Like the others, it's in my interest
to do business with you.

813
01:09:55,685 --> 01:09:59,644
And I must admit it's exciting
to be part of such a big adventure.

814
01:10:01,224 --> 01:10:03,556
What do you need
to open an account?

815
01:10:03,859 --> 01:10:06,851
As with any company,
a trade register certificate,

816
01:10:07,096 --> 01:10:10,190
an ID card,
and an initial transfer of funds.

817
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:15,037
But the transfer is the same problem
as the checkbook.

818
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:19,667
Well, in the meantime,
as the sums aren't very big,

819
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:21,868
we can offer invoice discounting.

820
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,537
That just buys you a few weeks.

821
01:10:27,851 --> 01:10:29,944
The legal limit is 2 months, but...

822
01:10:30,254 --> 01:10:33,485
You present us with your bills,
and we'll honor them.

823
01:10:34,157 --> 01:10:36,682
It solves a firm's
cash flow problems.

824
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,920
Not that companies like yours
are strapped for cash!

825
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:43,926
That's good.

826
01:10:48,038 --> 01:10:51,030
With the gasoline
and lighting, that's the total.

827
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:54,167
Call me if you need me.

828
01:11:02,019 --> 01:11:04,715
37,000 euros?
Your car costs more than that!

829
01:11:07,659 --> 01:11:08,751
I'll get things started,

830
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:12,522
but I need your company ID number.

831
01:11:12,664 --> 01:11:14,632
That's very important, OK?

832
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,188
Thank you again.

833
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:23,071
Have lunch with us... for once.

834
01:11:42,026 --> 01:11:44,494
How long will it take to dry?

835
01:11:44,629 --> 01:11:47,860
2 days, provided it doesn't rain,
but it could well do.

836
01:11:47,999 --> 01:11:49,968
I can't wait 2 days.

837
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:52,760
I thought of something last night.

838
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:56,039
If the embankments
are 8 instead of 10,

839
01:11:56,175 --> 01:11:58,973
that's 20,000 cubic yards
less earth to move.

840
01:11:59,578 --> 01:12:02,069
If you can do 50 rotations
instead of 35,

841
01:12:02,214 --> 01:12:04,182
we save a week.

842
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,811
If we use more, won't it dry faster?

843
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:08,008
We can try.

844
01:12:08,153 --> 01:12:11,418
The 28th!
We have to finish by the 28th.

845
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:14,049
Come on!

846
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:17,395
Hello. Philippe Miller here.

847
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:20,464
No, I have the bill
right in front of me.

848
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:22,157
A total of 1 1 ,630.

849
01:12:22,634 --> 01:12:25,626
I'll do it as quickly as possible.
You have my word.

850
01:12:26,171 --> 01:12:27,570
2,125 euros.

851
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:31,104
When it rains,
we can't get anything done.

852
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,505
Hello. This is Mr Miller here.

853
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:37,081
There's a problem
with the checkbook.

854
01:12:37,384 --> 01:12:39,818
The start of next week
at the latest.

855
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:42,613
No, it's not
in my own best interest.

856
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:46,783
We'll do what's necessary.
And I'll handle it myself.

857
01:12:49,129 --> 01:12:51,120
Look what he's just sent.

858
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:57,661
That's no good, it's not an original.

859
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:01,138
- Should I call him back?
- Yes, do.

860
01:13:01,608 --> 01:13:04,099
- Did you send his checkbooks?
- Yes.

861
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:08,647
Look at that.
Isn't it something?

862
01:13:09,182 --> 01:13:11,480
I'll take you. It's worth seeing.

863
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:26,564
Now you'll stop saying
we're not a regular firm.

864
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:29,897
You've spent far more than you said.

865
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:31,934
I still have to pay for fuel.

866
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:33,630
It's gonna be a problem.

867
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,604
Call Louis, tell him I'm on my way.
Off we go.

868
01:13:39,013 --> 01:13:40,913
- Can you sign this?
- Later.

869
01:13:41,048 --> 01:13:45,109
There's been a mistake.
You were sent a fax.

870
01:13:45,953 --> 01:13:47,853
Yeah, I'll deal with it.

871
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:52,719
The other thing is, I've just checked
your first statement.

872
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:56,660
I have it here.
This isn't at all what we agreed.

873
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:00,728
I can't hear you.
It's too noisy.

874
01:14:01,536 --> 01:14:02,696
I'll call you back.

875
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,596
As soon as you can. Goodbye.

876
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:17,509
- It's starting to look like something.
- Like a road!

877
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:24,886
Let's go have coffee.

878
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,124
Excuse me... Hello.

879
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:37,729
You know they buried the Pharaohs
with a beetle on their chest?

880
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,564
No, I didn't.

881
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:43,768
One of my men told me today.
I had no idea.

882
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,080
Did you work all night?

883
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,641
I didn't hear you leave.

884
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,477
I'm sorry.

885
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,181
Don't worry.

886
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,088
I want you.

887
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,787
I think about it all the time.

888
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:03,631
All the time.

889
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,128
I didn't know
you could feel this way.

890
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,067
Love you.

891
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:33,963
Come on, guys!

892
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:41,870
The owner of the scooter
may not press charges.

893
01:15:42,172 --> 01:15:43,799
I didn't even damage it.

894
01:15:43,941 --> 01:15:45,499
Sign here.

895
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:49,806
Will you ever stop messing up?

896
01:16:07,197 --> 01:16:09,223
Did you give the cops
my number?

897
01:16:10,268 --> 01:16:12,065
They can get that anywhere.

898
01:16:13,304 --> 01:16:17,035
I just said I worked for you.
It was the magic word.

899
01:16:18,109 --> 01:16:19,337
Bunch of jerks!

900
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:22,944
All that for a stupid scooter...

901
01:16:24,315 --> 01:16:26,909
I don't deal anymore,
just deliver.

902
01:16:27,986 --> 01:16:30,352
I threw it all away
before the cops got me.

903
01:16:32,924 --> 01:16:35,324
I don't know how I'll pay for it.

904
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:43,000
They say, after prison,
you wanna take on the world.

905
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:44,963
Maybe that's what I need.

906
01:16:47,171 --> 01:16:49,731
After prison, you're all alone.

907
01:16:50,008 --> 01:16:52,978
You'd shoot yourself
rather than go back inside.

908
01:17:07,192 --> 01:17:09,717
Put that on plates
and spread them out.

909
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:10,984
Is there a dance?

910
01:17:21,707 --> 01:17:24,767
You lower the blade
to scoop up the earth.

911
01:17:25,044 --> 01:17:26,409
It's called a scraper.

912
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:29,014
That's the safety. Like that,

913
01:17:29,148 --> 01:17:31,082
it won't start.

914
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:36,154
Gaby, I want Nicolas
to demonstrate the excavator.

915
01:17:36,289 --> 01:17:37,813
We'll show you how it works.

916
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,126
Thanks, Gaby.

917
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:47,293
- Esteban, up you go.
- I don't have a license!

918
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:49,026
Step back, kids.

919
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:51,230
Give him a big hand!

920
01:17:51,638 --> 01:17:53,799
Nicolas! Nicolas!

921
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:11,057
The kids have a surprise.

922
01:18:18,064 --> 01:18:20,829
Don't worry, I won't damage it.

923
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:28,999
Finish practising with Gaby.

924
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:31,867
Then, you can join the night crew.
How's that?

925
01:19:32,007 --> 01:19:33,975
Day or night's fine by me.

926
01:19:34,242 --> 01:19:35,834
That's OK with me.

927
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,703
How's that, then?

928
01:19:58,568 --> 01:20:00,934
There are things about my life
you don't know.

929
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:11,139
You can start a new life.
That's what life's for.

930
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:17,753
I haven't wanted to settle down
in a long time.

931
01:20:23,492 --> 01:20:25,460
It'd make me very happy.

932
01:20:59,029 --> 01:21:00,519
The bank manager rang all day.

933
01:21:00,664 --> 01:21:03,462
To hell with him. He's nobody.

934
01:21:04,034 --> 01:21:05,501
Who'll pay for all this?

935
01:21:05,636 --> 01:21:08,605
He's rejected
our most recent checks.

936
01:21:08,872 --> 01:21:11,136
All the suppliers are yelling at me.

937
01:21:12,744 --> 01:21:13,733
I'm sick of it.

938
01:21:14,545 --> 01:21:16,172
I'm trying to help you.

939
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:19,182
Look how beautiful it is.

940
01:21:19,851 --> 01:21:22,046
You don't realize what's happening.

941
01:21:22,253 --> 01:21:24,881
If it was going to stop,
we'd know by now.

942
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:27,019
Why should it stop?

943
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,802
C'mon, guys, c'mon!

944
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:57,511
DO NOT OPEN

945
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,901
Project Manager of Highway 61a

946
01:23:50,371 --> 01:23:52,737
Come along with me, Nicolas.

947
01:24:01,348 --> 01:24:02,406
Leave a message.

948
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:06,510
This is Mr Barracher from the bank.
I keep leaving you messages.

949
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:07,982
I have to say

950
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:10,683
that unless you sort out
the paperwork,

951
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:13,019
I'll have to consult my superiors.

952
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:17,057
I think it's deplorable
that it's come to this.

953
01:24:17,499 --> 01:24:20,991
This cannot continue,
so please call me back very soon.

954
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:26,163
What about these 2 checks?

955
01:24:26,842 --> 01:24:27,774
What can I do?

956
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:30,173
He'll only open an account elsewhere.

957
01:24:33,582 --> 01:24:35,413
I believed in this guy.

958
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,645
I believed in him.

959
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,238
C'mon, guys, c'monI

960
01:25:40,117 --> 01:25:41,675
When did this happen?

961
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:46,085
They took the petty cash.

962
01:25:47,558 --> 01:25:49,048
Why do people do this?

963
01:25:49,193 --> 01:25:51,161
How am I supposed to work now?

964
01:25:51,762 --> 01:25:53,229
The printer's gone.

965
01:25:57,734 --> 01:26:00,532
Don't throw these away.
They're important.

966
01:26:01,805 --> 01:26:03,102
No, we have no idea.

967
01:26:03,807 --> 01:26:05,741
Last month,
they wrecked a school.

968
01:26:06,577 --> 01:26:09,171
So, what now?
Do you need papers?

969
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:13,074
We've seen the damage.
Now you must come file a complaint.

970
01:26:14,117 --> 01:26:15,049
You're here?

971
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,849
I'm working.

972
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:22,649
One of your employees
is a familiar face. That boy.

973
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,657
He works for us.

974
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:27,127
It's not him.

975
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,630
Well, goodbye.

976
01:26:42,814 --> 01:26:45,248
The police said
you won't file a complaint.

977
01:26:48,853 --> 01:26:49,877
Why's that?

978
01:26:50,822 --> 01:26:53,757
I don't have time.
Not anymore.

979
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:03,026
It's not that bad. Come here.

980
01:27:18,684 --> 01:27:20,015
What is it?

981
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:28,185
I have to go.

982
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,665
I'll let you know, Mrs Arnaud.

983
01:27:36,802 --> 01:27:37,962
Come with me.

984
01:27:40,039 --> 01:27:41,028
Someone to see you.

985
01:27:52,152 --> 01:27:53,915
Is this a bad time?

986
01:28:00,627 --> 01:28:03,994
The bastards!
They did it last night?

987
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:08,998
Wow!

988
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:12,468
You told the insurer?

989
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:15,005
Yes, but they'll take ages
to pay out.

990
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:17,473
I can't work without a computer.

991
01:28:22,082 --> 01:28:24,482
Should I call you boss?

992
01:28:31,492 --> 01:28:34,791
I met a lot of locals,
looking for you.

993
01:28:35,563 --> 01:28:40,023
They call you the big boss,
Mr Philippe.

994
01:28:40,801 --> 01:28:42,200
"'Mr"' Philippe...

995
01:28:45,973 --> 01:28:47,565
How did you find me?

996
01:28:49,243 --> 01:28:52,110
Someone saw you on TV,
showing off.

997
01:28:54,548 --> 01:28:56,778
You ain't exactly discreet.

998
01:28:59,186 --> 01:29:02,178
What exactly is all this crap?

999
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,123
What do you want? Money?

1000
01:29:08,095 --> 01:29:09,620
Dough!

1001
01:29:10,966 --> 01:29:12,490
Bread!

1002
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:21,075
The car and all the rest you took
makes a lot of bread.

1003
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:28,674
You steal a lot of bread
off these folk?

1004
01:29:29,918 --> 01:29:31,715
I'm not doing it for the money.

1005
01:29:35,023 --> 01:29:36,752
Why do you do it, then?

1006
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:41,584
Why?

1007
01:29:47,068 --> 01:29:48,968
You know that Claude left me?

1008
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:53,167
You caused me a lot of trouble.

1009
01:30:00,316 --> 01:30:02,250
I won't let you mess things up.

1010
01:30:02,552 --> 01:30:04,577
So, you might as well kill me now.

1011
01:30:07,089 --> 01:30:09,216
That's what I'm doing.

1012
01:30:16,866 --> 01:30:17,924
Here...

1013
01:30:21,838 --> 01:30:24,966
I found this little beetle
on your site.

1014
01:30:28,311 --> 01:30:30,609
I've got some, but not all of them.

1015
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:32,673
So long.

1016
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:07,517
I heard the news.

1017
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:10,780
Is everything in the box?

1018
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:12,183
Monika can call me.

1019
01:31:12,789 --> 01:31:13,778
What's the time?

1020
01:31:14,024 --> 01:31:15,150
Forty past ten.

1021
01:31:17,794 --> 01:31:20,389
Monika said
you haven't paid for the fuel.

1022
01:31:20,532 --> 01:31:22,659
I want to finish before it rains.

1023
01:31:22,901 --> 01:31:23,993
Is it going to rain?

1024
01:31:24,435 --> 01:31:26,767
We'll run out of gas in a few hours.

1025
01:31:41,519 --> 01:31:43,009
34,000.

1026
01:31:43,655 --> 01:31:45,486
Hurry it up!

1027
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,889
The gas is coming.
What else has to be paid for?

1028
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:51,525
The lighting.

1029
01:31:51,829 --> 01:31:54,559
He wants cash.
He won't wait till the 28th.

1030
01:31:59,904 --> 01:32:01,428
Give them that for now.

1031
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:04,869
What's going on?

1032
01:32:16,755 --> 01:32:18,689
I can sell you another car.

1033
01:32:40,713 --> 01:32:43,910
There's 10,000.
Now can you wait a week?

1034
01:32:44,116 --> 01:32:46,779
No, Mr Miller,
it's a matter of trust.

1035
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,716
What more do you need
to let us work?

1036
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:52,720
Please calm down.
Come into my office.

1037
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:54,688
- I don't have time.
- Mr Miller!

1038
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,295
What do I have to do?

1039
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:06,532
I rang his firm, CGI.

1040
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,638
They didn't even know
the work had resumed.

1041
01:33:10,377 --> 01:33:12,277
I'll call her back and find out.

1042
01:33:13,647 --> 01:33:14,705
Does your boss know?

1043
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:18,184
At first, he was so proud
to be a part of it.

1044
01:33:18,318 --> 01:33:22,448
Now he's afraid he'll be asked
to explain himself.

1045
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:28,259
Did you call the cops
about the break-in?

1046
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:32,222
He won't file a complaint.
And he's bought new stuff.

1047
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:33,590
He can't write checks.

1048
01:33:37,538 --> 01:33:39,199
I don't know
where he gets the money.

1049
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,565
We'll soon find out.

1050
01:33:47,148 --> 01:33:49,275
I don't want to land in shit again.

1051
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,049
- I gotta go to work.
- Now?

1052
01:34:59,355 --> 01:35:01,653
I'm working
from 9 PM to 5 AM.

1053
01:35:02,658 --> 01:35:03,886
Goodnight.

1054
01:35:31,154 --> 01:35:32,621
There's 10,000.

1055
01:35:34,524 --> 01:35:36,458
All that for 10,000 shitty euros.

1056
01:35:37,994 --> 01:35:39,257
It's all I have left.

1057
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:43,697
What next? You gonna pay 'em back
all the money you stole?

1058
01:35:48,272 --> 01:35:50,706
Your project's just hot air.

1059
01:35:51,975 --> 01:35:56,412
You'll go down for 10 years
and hang yourself in your cell.

1060
01:36:01,919 --> 01:36:04,444
Work is a fool's game,
I always said so.

1061
01:36:10,027 --> 01:36:15,124
I'm going to pay a little visit
to your friend, the lady mayor.

1062
01:36:19,536 --> 01:36:22,995
It'll give her a shock
when I spill the beans, won't it?

1063
01:36:26,578 --> 01:36:29,376
2 days... I'll give you 2 days.

1064
01:36:38,756 --> 01:36:40,383
You know where to reach me.

1065
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,029
Does it hurt?

1066
01:38:01,808 --> 01:38:04,276
I just want to finish my job.

1067
01:38:05,445 --> 01:38:06,673
Want to see a doctor?

1068
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,551
I've done some bad things in life.

1069
01:38:19,759 --> 01:38:21,317
You need to rest.

1070
01:38:22,829 --> 01:38:24,296
We'll make it.

1071
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:26,631
I know we will.

1072
01:38:27,767 --> 01:38:29,530
You can't carry on like this.

1073
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:33,265
Look at them.

1074
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:34,601
We'll make it.

1075
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:46,119
Stéphane, there are worrying rumors
about the highway.

1076
01:38:46,554 --> 01:38:48,146
False and unpaid invoices,

1077
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,182
trafficking...

1078
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:54,118
I hope
we haven't been helping a crook.

1079
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:57,223
What does he stand to gain from it?

1080
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:00,132
You were seen with that guy.

1081
01:39:00,568 --> 01:39:02,126
People talk.

1082
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:06,238
You were happy to have
your picture taken with "'that guy"'.

1083
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,634
C'mon, guys!

1084
01:39:10,077 --> 01:39:11,476
It's stopped raining.

1085
01:40:18,147 --> 01:40:20,240
We might finish tomorrow night.

1086
01:40:23,352 --> 01:40:24,546
Finish what?

1087
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:27,778
The road.

1088
01:40:30,827 --> 01:40:32,590
I don't want you to lie to me.

1089
01:40:33,629 --> 01:40:35,563
There's nothing more humiliating.

1090
01:40:37,066 --> 01:40:39,159
You've never been truly humiliated.

1091
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:50,572
I can't give up now.

1092
01:40:51,748 --> 01:40:53,306
It's too late.

1093
01:41:04,161 --> 01:41:06,095
I can't believe it.

1094
01:41:07,264 --> 01:41:08,754
I can't believe it's real.

1095
01:41:11,435 --> 01:41:12,527
Why?

1096
01:41:14,505 --> 01:41:16,132
Because it was possible.

1097
01:41:21,011 --> 01:41:22,638
With me, too?

1098
01:41:26,451 --> 01:41:28,476
We've done something extraordinary.

1099
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,537
Known Philippe long?

1100
01:41:51,242 --> 01:41:52,607
His real name's Paul.

1101
01:41:53,178 --> 01:41:54,304
Been on jobs together?

1102
01:41:55,413 --> 01:41:56,812
His name's Paul... Paulo.

1103
01:41:57,382 --> 01:41:58,849
I know that.

1104
01:42:00,618 --> 01:42:03,519
Hello. Good timing.
I'm with your little protégé!

1105
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:06,484
I've got the cash.

1106
01:42:06,724 --> 01:42:08,488
Hang on, I can't hear you.

1107
01:42:09,361 --> 01:42:10,521
Where can we meet?

1108
01:42:11,497 --> 01:42:13,761
Here. I'm at the Jack Pots.

1109
01:42:14,066 --> 01:42:15,658
I don't wanna be seen with you.

1110
01:42:16,068 --> 01:42:18,195
There's a sugar refinery nearby.

1111
01:42:19,805 --> 01:42:22,239
- Stay a while.
- I'm on the night shift.

1112
01:42:22,374 --> 01:42:23,306
Wait.

1113
01:42:24,143 --> 01:42:27,544
Can you get me some gear?
I hear you're the man.

1114
01:42:28,581 --> 01:42:29,570
You heard wrong.

1115
01:44:38,213 --> 01:44:39,942
Hello. Police.

1116
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:05,407
His car is in the parking lot.

1117
01:45:05,808 --> 01:45:07,503
No-one cleaned his room?

1118
01:45:07,643 --> 01:45:09,770
We didn't want to disturb him.

1119
01:45:17,387 --> 01:45:19,150
Should I call the police?

1120
01:45:22,325 --> 01:45:23,986
Philippe, it's Monika.

1121
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:49,314
It's Nicolas.
Bring some black coffee.

1122
01:45:49,453 --> 01:45:51,318
We looked all over for you.

1123
01:46:00,164 --> 01:46:02,394
Looks like you've done that
all your life.

1124
01:46:02,633 --> 01:46:04,430
It seems ages ago.

1125
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:06,798
I'll get the coffee
or it'll take hours.

1126
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:21,209
I saw your pal earlier.

1127
01:46:21,819 --> 01:46:23,787
He was leaving.
He looked rough.

1128
01:46:29,127 --> 01:46:30,958
We need you on site, Philippe.

1129
01:46:31,095 --> 01:46:33,063
We can't do anything without you.

1130
01:46:39,404 --> 01:46:41,201
Can you stop for a minute?

1131
01:46:46,377 --> 01:46:47,366
What's going on?

1132
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:49,376
I'm pregnant.

1133
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:55,982
We've been trying for a long time.
It worked at last.

1134
01:46:57,355 --> 01:47:00,415
- We wanted to tell you first.
- We're happy.

1135
01:47:10,134 --> 01:47:11,192
Congratulations.

1136
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:20,001
I spoke to the agency
this morning.

1137
01:47:21,013 --> 01:47:23,709
Your wages will be paid
as usual on Friday.

1138
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:25,781
Don't listen to gossip.

1139
01:47:26,085 --> 01:47:29,054
We have a job to finish.
We'll finish it together.

1140
01:47:29,188 --> 01:47:30,280
Well, we'll try.

1141
01:47:32,157 --> 01:47:34,022
- The beer's on me.
- Thanks.

1142
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,427
- I'll go talk to the night crew.
- Bye.

1143
01:47:40,766 --> 01:47:42,393
We'll take his word for it.

1144
01:47:42,535 --> 01:47:44,059
We have no choice.

1145
01:47:45,037 --> 01:47:46,163
We have to trust him.

1146
01:47:46,305 --> 01:47:48,432
There's always rumors flying around.

1147
01:47:48,741 --> 01:47:51,539
Rival firms try to mess things up.

1148
01:47:51,777 --> 01:47:54,075
We have mouths to feed.

1149
01:47:54,213 --> 01:47:58,514
If you work and don't get paid,
they're thieves, not bosses.

1150
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:30,546
We've had a bill for a firm called GMTR.
Heard of them?

1151
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:32,040
What's the bill?

1152
01:48:32,185 --> 01:48:35,154
Legrand, plant hire.
83,000 euros.

1153
01:48:35,288 --> 01:48:36,516
How much?!

1154
01:48:37,691 --> 01:48:39,421
Whose signature is this?

1155
01:48:42,129 --> 01:48:43,596
These are the latest plans.

1156
01:48:46,167 --> 01:48:47,327
Coffee?

1157
01:48:48,536 --> 01:48:49,525
What do you think?

1158
01:48:51,606 --> 01:48:53,836
- Well?
- Not good. Rain is forecast.

1159
01:48:55,109 --> 01:48:59,102
Let's protect these embankments.
They're the most exposed.

1160
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:01,204
Why don't we protect them to here?

1161
01:49:03,117 --> 01:49:04,414
Yeah, we can try.

1162
01:49:05,653 --> 01:49:07,382
What if there's heavy rain?

1163
01:49:07,722 --> 01:49:09,280
Then, we're dead.

1164
01:49:14,228 --> 01:49:15,718
You've reached Legrand.

1165
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:20,023
We're open from 8.;30 to 1 2.;30
and from 1.;30 to 6.

1166
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:21,726
Please leave a message.

1167
01:49:22,537 --> 01:49:24,630
This is the Accounts Dept. at CGI.

1168
01:49:25,374 --> 01:49:27,399
We have an order form

1169
01:49:27,509 --> 01:49:30,137
from GMTR.
It means nothing to us.

1170
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:32,140
Please call me back.

1171
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:37,115
I'm Mr Valais.
The number is 01 75 77 77 77.

1172
01:49:37,252 --> 01:49:38,549
Thanks, bye.

1173
01:49:39,187 --> 01:49:40,654
Here's another one.

1174
01:49:40,789 --> 01:49:42,450
Same signature.

1175
01:49:43,592 --> 01:49:45,389
What's he playing at?

1176
01:50:00,242 --> 01:50:01,766
Hello, Mr Legrand here.

1177
01:50:02,077 --> 01:50:06,037
You left me a message
about an invoice for Highway 61 .

1178
01:50:07,617 --> 01:50:11,109
I deal with someone
from your company. Or rather, GMTR.

1179
01:50:12,255 --> 01:50:15,816
Yes, that's right. Philippe Miller.

1180
01:50:24,867 --> 01:50:26,095
What?

1181
01:50:30,673 --> 01:50:31,799
The agency sent the wages.

1182
01:50:32,742 --> 01:50:34,607
It's the last time, Philippe.

1183
01:50:35,645 --> 01:50:37,203
On Monday,
the bills'll be unpaid.

1184
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:39,480
We'll have finished then.

1185
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:43,041
Try to stall them with that.

1186
01:50:45,688 --> 01:50:46,848
Here...

1187
01:50:47,690 --> 01:50:49,556
Come on, move it.

1188
01:50:50,260 --> 01:50:51,522
Move all this!

1189
01:50:51,662 --> 01:50:53,596
C'mon, guys, we gotta finish!

1190
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:56,726
Here, Lionel.

1191
01:50:56,867 --> 01:50:58,391
Frédéric.

1192
01:51:06,677 --> 01:51:08,304
- Thanks.
- Come with me.

1193
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:11,312
Louis, he'll be in charge
of an excavator tonight.

1194
01:51:13,517 --> 01:51:15,178
We must finish tonight.

1195
01:51:25,195 --> 01:51:27,595
I just spoke to the people at CGI.

1196
01:51:30,901 --> 01:51:33,302
They said
you gave me a false order form,

1197
01:51:34,272 --> 01:51:36,740
that there's no construction
in the area.

1198
01:51:37,242 --> 01:51:39,142
The work doesn't exist.

1199
01:51:43,882 --> 01:51:46,510
So, none of this exists?

1200
01:51:46,718 --> 01:51:50,154
I think it does exist.
They're your machines.

1201
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,947
So, I don't exist either?
You're talking to no-one!

1202
01:51:54,359 --> 01:51:55,519
No-one!

1203
01:52:00,732 --> 01:52:01,960
Here, Bernard.

1204
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:17,508
Let's go to your office.

1205
01:52:17,783 --> 01:52:20,946
If it doesn't rain,
we'll finish tonight. What do you want?

1206
01:52:21,187 --> 01:52:22,279
Want us to stop?

1207
01:52:27,393 --> 01:52:29,827
Guys, we gotta finish tonight.

1208
01:52:30,496 --> 01:52:32,123
So, who wants to carry on?

1209
01:52:34,133 --> 01:52:35,361
We carry on!

1210
01:52:41,373 --> 01:52:43,568
There we go, the discussion's over.

1211
01:53:19,379 --> 01:53:22,212
Hello. I'm Daniel Barraux,
Operations Manager.

1212
01:53:22,949 --> 01:53:24,644
I didn't understand my assistant...

1213
01:53:25,452 --> 01:53:26,714
Let me explain.

1214
01:53:27,954 --> 01:53:30,354
You're one of our works managers?

1215
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:31,722
Not exactly.

1216
01:53:41,402 --> 01:53:42,391
There...

1217
01:53:43,404 --> 01:53:45,804
In the beginning,
there was a beetle problem.

1218
01:53:46,707 --> 01:53:47,765
A what?

1219
01:53:49,977 --> 01:53:51,274
A beetle.

1220
01:54:29,017 --> 01:54:31,781
In 90 days, we've managed
to go from here...

1221
01:54:33,121 --> 01:54:34,088
to here.

1222
01:54:34,856 --> 01:54:37,518
If it doesn't rain,
we should finish tonight.

1223
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,286
Finish what?

1224
01:54:43,098 --> 01:54:45,123
You've built a section of highway?

1225
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:47,095
It'll be daylight in 3 hours.

1226
01:54:47,803 --> 01:54:51,102
You went to CGI today?
What did they say?

1227
01:54:52,541 --> 01:54:54,304
They said they trusted us.

1228
01:54:57,279 --> 01:54:58,769
It mustn't rain.

1229
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:05,150
It should even end up
costing less than a normal project.

1230
01:55:08,124 --> 01:55:10,388
What do you mean, "'normal project"'?

1231
01:55:10,526 --> 01:55:12,721
Where's this road?
Where does it go?

1232
01:55:19,369 --> 01:55:20,666
I don't know.

1233
01:55:23,139 --> 01:55:24,436
Nowhere.

1234
01:55:48,164 --> 01:55:49,825
Don't forget your seat belt.

1235
01:56:10,187 --> 01:56:12,121
How did you get this paperwork?

1236
01:56:12,823 --> 01:56:14,381
I just did.

1237
01:56:39,184 --> 01:56:40,617
I'll tell 'em to stop.

1238
01:56:40,752 --> 01:56:41,810
We keep going!

1239
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,384
- It's too dangerous.
- We keep going!

1240
01:57:00,138 --> 01:57:02,231
I just want you to save my team.

1241
01:57:03,675 --> 01:57:05,836
Because they trusted me.

1242
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:08,279
And because it's not their fault.

1243
01:57:11,649 --> 01:57:13,480
I don't really matter.

1244
01:57:55,794 --> 01:57:57,853
I was lucky to have met them.

1245
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:01,759
I was lucky...

1246
01:58:21,588 --> 01:58:23,749
- Hang on...
- It hurts!

1247
01:58:24,391 --> 01:58:25,449
It's stuck!

1248
01:58:30,530 --> 01:58:31,554
There's gasoline!

1249
01:58:37,837 --> 01:58:39,930
Don't leave me!

1250
01:58:50,251 --> 01:58:51,240
Nicolas!

1251
01:59:07,668 --> 01:59:08,726
Over there!

1252
01:59:33,562 --> 01:59:35,962
He's upstairs?
We have to call the police.

1253
01:59:36,565 --> 01:59:39,625
He's behind all the false order forms.

1254
01:59:39,901 --> 01:59:41,493
We must file a complaint.

1255
01:59:42,404 --> 01:59:43,894
He came of his own accord.

1256
01:59:49,544 --> 01:59:51,478
Are those his papers?

1257
01:59:53,982 --> 01:59:56,041
He's done a runner.

1258
01:59:56,752 --> 01:59:58,652
What has he left behind?

1259
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:09,727
Thank you, boss

1260
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:15,733
We have to file a complaint.

1261
02:00:18,541 --> 02:00:21,567
An unconscious burns victim
for shock treatment.

1262
02:00:23,313 --> 02:00:24,302
Sit down.

1263
02:00:24,447 --> 02:00:25,812
What'll they do to him?

1264
02:00:28,918 --> 02:00:31,478
He shouldn't have been on his own.

1265
02:00:32,855 --> 02:00:34,345
He won't die?

1266
02:01:10,561 --> 02:01:12,358
Leave us alone.

1267
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:13,697
Miss?

1268
02:01:17,634 --> 02:01:18,692
It's alright.

1269
02:01:19,403 --> 02:01:22,634
He has extensive burns,
but he'll be OK.

1270
02:01:33,384 --> 02:01:34,373
Gaby, don't!

1271
02:01:34,818 --> 02:01:35,750
You fucker!

1272
02:01:39,624 --> 02:01:41,489
Fucker!

1273
02:01:41,793 --> 02:01:42,782
Crook!

1274
02:01:42,927 --> 02:01:44,417
Sorry about that, boss.

1275
02:01:46,364 --> 02:01:47,854
Why did you do this to us?

1276
02:01:49,634 --> 02:01:50,760
Scumbag!

1277
02:01:58,943 --> 02:01:59,932
- Sir.
- Well?

1278
02:02:00,545 --> 02:02:02,376
He was at the hospital 2 hours ago.

1279
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:05,276
- What name do you know him by?
- Philippe Miller.

1280
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:07,510
- Is he armed?
- No idea.

1281
02:02:07,652 --> 02:02:10,314
- Stop him by dawn.
- We'll try.

1282
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:23,959
This is the place, sir.

1283
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:27,401
I think he's long gone.

1284
02:05:13,008 --> 02:05:15,910
After his last prison term,
"'Philippe Miller"'disappeared.

1285
02:05:16,045 --> 02:05:17,478
No-one knows where he is.

1286
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:20,911
When the "'real"' work resumed,

1287
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:23,610
all the workers and suppliers
were rehired or compensated.

1288
02:05:25,455 --> 02:05:27,946
Only the temping agency
filed a complaint.

1289
02:05:29,726 --> 02:05:31,990
GMTR's work was deemed
to be in conformity

1290
02:05:32,128 --> 02:05:33,925
by the Highways Department.

1291
02:05:35,465 --> 02:05:37,626
The beetles were moved
to a nearby forest.
