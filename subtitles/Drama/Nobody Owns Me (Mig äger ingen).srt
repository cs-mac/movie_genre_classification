1
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:01,460
Andersson.

2
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:15,744
- Is not he coming?
- He is not invited.

3
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,704
Why not?

4
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:22,384
Is not sin?
It's your father.

5
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:06,386
- Hello my girl!
- Look, it's Daddy!

6
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,936
Hello! Hey, hey.

7
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:16,938
- Kalvesylten, did you remember it?
- Damn! The I forgot.

8
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:24,656
Then we go. - What the hell, I'm just
a little happy. The You're allowed to be?

9
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,666
- Press.
- What?

10
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:00,784
- At your fingertips.
- Why?

11
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:05,258
Because I have fought against the dragon
today. Pressure.

12
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:11,740
Harder. Put everything in you.
Both hands. Pressure.

13
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:16,218
Press. That's it.

14
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:22,017
Now I feel like a tiger again.

15
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:32,695
- Do you think Santa will be here tomorrow?
- Mm.

16
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:37,780
You know that it's just grandpa,
who disguised themselves?

17
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:42,939
Or so we shit on the whole
and stay home. Just the three of us.

18
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:48,099
- We go there as agreed.
- It is no maximum on your wish list.

19
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:54,101
- So dangerous is it any?
- No. It's worse.

20
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:57,735
We should abolish Christmas.
We can begin tomorrow.

21
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:03,264
- No.
- We can eliminate my siblings too.

22
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:08,419
- Now we eat.
- Tighten the muscles.

23
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:15,019
Are you ready? Press to.

24
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:19,417
Ha! It was the tin.

25
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,736
Helan yesterday

30
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:48,177
- Need some more brandy?
- Can I get some meatballs?

31
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:53,976
I saw you in the Great Square.
The Upside of Anger heard all the way in Tempo.

32
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:56,180
- What were you against?
- For.

33
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,144
- What?
- Equal pay for equal work.

34
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:03,376
- Were you indeed?
- I work.

35
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:07,776
- It was a Saturday.
- She joined the newspaper.

36
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:11,334
Should I talk politics?
I will just fall out.

37
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:14,815
- I have no quarrel.
- Do you have what you need?

38
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:20,377
I'm just saying that it is.
The labor movement split of women.

39
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:25,015
- Is there a bubble in alcohol?
- No. This is soda.

40
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:27,539
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

41
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:33,699
Kalle have not gotten anything
since the First World War.

42
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,424
Second World War.

43
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:42,182
And the gender struggle, what is it?
Two-sex fight? A pussy and a cock?

44
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:45,097
- Stop, Rolf!
- What's he saying?

45
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:55,538
Little Brother, it is a soft package this year.
Velour Pants, extra small.

46
00:06:55,624 --> 00:07:01,859
- How sweet! May he inherit your?
- Were you might ask.

47
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:06,859
- Are you sitting and laughing, you devil ?!
- Stop, boys!

48
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:10,140
- Do something!
- No, I will not give a shit.

49
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,932
- They have to fend for yourself.
- Now I smoke out!

50
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:17,857
- Both of you! Head first!
- No, now keep in!

51
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:22,016
- It's Christmas Eve, dammit!
- Now you'll wise up!

52
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:25,016
- Get it together!
- Think of the children.

53
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,936
Splitter Throughout the house at ?!

54
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:35,296
See what mom says.
- Hello. Well. So, yes.

55
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:41,292
You did well.
Oh, to not believe you're the betting.

56
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:34,976
Katja
No... No, I will not. La 'be.

57
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,852
I will not. Stop now.

58
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:55,176
You can get into.

59
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:05,253
- Hey, what do you have there?
- Pippi Longstocking.

60
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:16,695
Katja! My brother bought a used
plate, the stingy bastard.

61
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,900
Katja! Come ska 'you hear!

62
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:28,019
- Off. Turn off, I said!
- It's fucking funny bro.

63
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,177
<i> Turn! Turn the </i>

64
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:54,734
Where's Mom?

65
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:58,500
She soon.

66
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:05,577
Fuck out and play a little.

67
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:10,610
- When's mother?
- I do not know, I say.

68
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:18,420
She has no socks.

69
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,574
Levelling...

70
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:37,095
Nothing about pancakes.

71
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:45,335
- What should we do?
- Mother must make them.

72
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:50,891
Yeah, she is.

73
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:54,610
Where have you been?

74
00:10:54,701 --> 00:11:00,538
You can not just disappear like that.
What is...?

75
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,295
What are you doing?

76
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:12,250
Mother's gone mad.
Stop that. I talk to her.

77
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:17,335
What are you doing?
Did I do something?

78
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,052
Say what it is.
Can not we talk about it?

79
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,813
You...

80
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,215
I have to go again.

81
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,139
See you soon.

82
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,731
Wait a minute.

83
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,978
What time is it?

84
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,538
Come. Come on.

85
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:54,171
- Satan's shit... When opening the nursery?
- I do not know.

86
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,569
Jump up.

87
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,852
- Sit properly. Are you?
- Yes.

88
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,453
Hold.

89
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:12,218
- Where is the nursery?
- The road.

90
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,939
The Way?

91
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,457
- This is the right way, right?
- Yes.

92
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,576
Go so.

93
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,296
Wait. Take it off.

94
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:43,049
Hello. A father passes.
Fun! Will you also?

95
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,656
Yes. So fun it will be neither.
- Mommy will get you. Goodbye.

96
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:52,256
- Coming mom?
- Yes. Have a good time. Goodbye.

97
00:13:56,938 --> 00:14:02,092
- Mom would pick me up.
- I know.

98
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:06,570
- You promised.
- I know.

99
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:10,849
She's not home.

100
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,695
Mph.

101
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:23,614
Did it? Of course it rings.

102
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,888
- Andersson.
- Am I interrupting?

103
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:34,367
- Not at all.
- Safe?

104
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,531
No, no. We just came...

105
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:40,973
We just got home.

106
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:45,494
- How are you?
- Good. Is she there?

107
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:50,812
What are you doing? Where are you?
I called everywhere.

108
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:55,734
Your sister and mother and...

109
00:14:55,818 --> 00:15:01,496
What's going on?
We miss you.

110
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,098
I miss you.

111
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:12,130
- What should I do?
- Nothing.

112
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:17,895
I can act and wash up and...

113
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:21,015
There is another.

114
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,806
Do not cry.

115
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,089
- Sorry.
- No, no...

116
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,652
<i> Do not say anything to her.
I will tell it yourself. </i>

117
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:53,927
- Of course. It's fine. Hey.
- Hello.

118
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,286
Father?

119
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,813
Father?

120
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:41,126
Father!

121
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:52,415
Did she say why?

122
00:16:56,296 --> 00:17:00,733
- Did you hit her?
- No.

123
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:08,487
How the hell did this for?

124
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:13,127
- Losing his woman - done!
- She'll be back.

125
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:18,245
They have so many ideas for the moment.
La 'not do that.

126
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:24,776
- She is good in many ways.
- Have you told her?

127
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:31,690
Do not throw it all over the tables,
if you want a chance.

128
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:35,974
- The girl we take care of for so long.
- Father!

129
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,696
Honey. Come on.

130
00:18:44,615 --> 00:18:50,008
- You... Wait. Come on.
- No.

131
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:54,770
Become  'here. You...

132
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,769
You... Wait.

133
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:05,170
Wait.

134
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:10,727
I will never leave you.

135
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:14,449
Ever.

136
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:18,533
We must put it here.

137
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:23,528
Do you understand? Good.

138
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:09,966
What are you doing?

139
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:30,089
Yes... So it tomorrow.

140
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:52,885
Do you know what it is today?
It's Saturday.

141
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:55,726
The boat Saturday.

142
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:04,202
Coming mom?

143
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:09,288
No, not today.
Some of the legs.

144
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:19,249
Hello.

145
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,847
So. Down with you.

146
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:34,364
- How nice!
- This one? A stupid plastic tub.

147
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:40,608
True with soft seating and
flag in the ass, but it's no boat.

148
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:44,926
This... It's a real boat.

149
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,849
I have restored her completely even.
I started when you were born.

150
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:56,009
Oak from Blekinge. The finest
kind. Feel how she breathes?

151
00:21:56,093 --> 00:21:59,085
- She?
- Yes. She.

152
00:21:59,173 --> 00:22:05,726
<i> Man she says of both.
This one is special. Listen. </i>

153
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,372
She says her name.

154
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,650
Gold lump. After you!

155
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:19,489
Mom thought it was a good idea.
How was it then.

156
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:25,771
And then she said that the first trip, the
we must do together.

157
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:28,810
- Must mother?
- Yes.

158
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:33,284
- My Mother?
- Yes. It must be three on board.

159
00:22:33,372 --> 00:22:39,243
A captain, a sailor and a ship's cook.
It's mother.

160
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:45,968
- I can feel it.
- Yes. We must make her ready.

161
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:51,081
You and me. Together.

162
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:59,045
There is coffee! There is enough for you too.
To each his æggemad. And a little juice.

163
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:03,808
No thanks, we do not have anything.
Girl eating at the restaurant.

164
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,403
Come.

165
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,409
Come on.

166
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:23,406
Sausage and french fries - is it good enough?

167
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:28,731
Thirteen crowns! Are you crazy?

168
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:37,089
You? Can you stay,
until we get home?

169
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:39,685
Safe?

170
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:42,206
How.

171
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:48,162
- What do you want? Milk? Soda?
- I can not drink soda.

172
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:52,245
- What kind of sandwiches?
- Do you really know?

173
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,481
Yes.

174
00:23:55,611 --> 00:24:00,606
- Two egg sandwiches so?
- A. One is enough. Thank you.

175
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,890
Father?

176
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:13,326
Are we poor?

177
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:20,650
We are workers.
Workers are at. definition poor.

178
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:26,124
<i> Poverty is doing
differences between individuals. </i>

179
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,169
<i> It's such a class society arises: </i>

180
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:33,563
<i> When someone takes to make money on
the work of others. </i>

181
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:38,202
- Is not it unfair?
- Yes, it's damn unfair.

182
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:44,730
I work eight hours a day. Sheep
paid for four. The rest takes Wallenberg.

183
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:50,249
But there is a country
which has eradicated poverty.

184
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,764
There. There you have Cuba.

185
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,721
- So small.
- Yes, but big here.

186
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,999
Communism, you see,
is the most beautiful thing there is.

187
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:20,210
Not the terrible Stalin kind. No.
, as it was thought at the outset.

188
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,488
Money does not exist.
One exchange things with each other.

189
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:31,408
Maybe a mat...
a pair of shoes.

190
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,245
Missing you specified or

191
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,609
- they just go into the store
and take it simply.

192
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,561
This one does. Not too much, not
in abundance. It should be enough for everyone.

193
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,085
So. Come on.

194
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,923
And then from the farms...

195
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:03,564
<i>... is well-laid tables. </i>

196
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:10,521
Man turns to make ædelsen
and then you sit and eat together.

197
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:14,568
No need to feel lonely.

198
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:18,483
And you talk with each other.

199
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:25,441
About important things. Not a lot of shit
as platform shoes and Swedish top...

200
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:33,363
... but about things that matter.
Chile, Greece.

201
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,366
About how you want
it must be on Earth.

202
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:45,968
So, after dinner,
'll take you to the beach.

203
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,521
Watching the sunset.

204
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:56,604
Winter does not exist.
It has been abolished.

205
00:26:56,689 --> 00:27:00,364
It's summer all the time.

206
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:07,049
- There I will go.
- Osse me.

207
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:20,279
I think we should take 'the boat there.

208
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,923
- But what's up with mom?
- Mother? Mother to be with.

209
00:27:30,088 --> 00:27:35,925
Is there anyone who will
classless society, it's her.

210
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:38,648
Clear the mother to be with.

211
00:27:38,728 --> 00:27:43,325
Father?

212
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:46,924
Are we communists?

213
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:50,478
Yes, we are.

214
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,998
But do not tell anyone.

215
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,767
<i> And then we both
best friends and companions. </i>

216
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,886
Did you know?

217
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:14,647
And you? Spark not so much in the night.

218
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,641
I have such a hard time sleeping.

219
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:26,961
- Good night, best friend.
- Good night, best buddy.

220
00:28:46,807 --> 00:28:49,606
Can I see - look up.

221
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:56,323
So. It's fine.

222
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,678
- Hi.
- Hello.

223
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:08,603
- Come on. How nice you are.
- Thank you.

224
00:29:09,927 --> 00:29:14,558
Never mind. We slips immediately.

225
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:22,436
Anybody here?

226
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:26,527
Hello.

227
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:39,846
- Come on, honey.
- No!

228
00:29:39,927 --> 00:29:44,046
- Sweet came.
- So. Come on.

229
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:54,398
You? Grandmother has been in the Soviet Union.
She might have bought something for you.

230
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,279
You need to meet someone today.

231
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:20,962
How I've missed you.

232
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,325
- I've got a boat.
- Lump of gold?

233
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:34,842
- Father and I make her ready.
- How fun!

234
00:30:34,926 --> 00:30:38,760
Then you have enough to do.
But you will not sail without me.

235
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:42,396
- Coffee is set over.
- Thank you.

236
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:46,438
- When did you come?
- Three days ago.

237
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:49,723
- I guess it was cold in Moscow?
- Icy.

238
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,720
What do you think of this for me?

239
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:58,195
- Beautiful!
- Can you squeeze it together?

240
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:01,517
That? Yes...

241
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:04,962
They are tougher than you think.

242
00:31:05,046 --> 00:31:09,279
- How!
- Nothing to boast about.

243
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:14,884
- Okay, I am the rock not proletarians.
- What is a proletarian?

244
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:19,199
- It's... well...
- Your father is.

245
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:24,679
- Proletarians are the best.
- What's Eating Me?

246
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:31,519
- Where are you going?
- Home.

247
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:36,156
But you gotta sleep here! With me.

248
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:43,484
- Bye, honey.
- Goodbye.

249
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:53,438
- How are you?
- Good.

250
00:31:56,525 --> 00:32:00,519
He SKUs use two hands, the fool?

251
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:05,395
- He talks the most.
- Well? He is not the first?

252
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:08,557
- Not just that.
- Oh...

253
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:14,201
- I do not think he's best at something.
- Do not you think?

254
00:32:36,165 --> 00:32:39,044
We're out for a walk.

255
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:45,444
To work. We must meet the dragon.

256
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:27,954
There, yes. Good.

257
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:37,161
No, wait.
When it switches to six gives it more.

258
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,883
Change so.

259
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,639
Change so.

260
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:49,039
Hell machine!

261
00:34:51,163 --> 00:34:53,962
- It's come to a halt.
- Huh?

262
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:47,801
Time do they open?

263
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:58,072
I have to go back. I'm late.

264
00:36:00,322 --> 00:36:04,998
This will surely anyone yet?
Do not you think?

265
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:12,115
What should I do?
They have just me.

266
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:19,921
And do not tell anyone,
that you were with Dad at work.

267
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:24,519
Then just
a lot of gossip.

268
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:28,596
Wait here, so there will be none.
Okay?

269
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:34,392
Hello.

270
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:50,319
He came up to me one day,
the pointy-nosed asshole, and said:

271
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:57,990
"Look Kalle"... No, so he said:
"Karl Andersson."

272
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:04,999
"You are the coolest man on the floor.
We did not do without you."

273
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:09,200
Yes, so he said.
You know what I said?

274
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:15,596
"Look, Marcus Wallenberg,
you are the coolest capitalist" -

275
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:20,881
- "and without you,
we are doing absolutely excellent!"

276
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:27,671
Then he was silent.

277
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,080
Do not you believe me, slut?

278
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:36,234
Eat properly,
so you get some food.

279
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:47,037
- He is hot.
- He may well throw the jacket?

280
00:37:55,881 --> 00:38:00,114
Jo... How are things going at home?

281
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:06,112
The horseradish was dismal.
It should feel like two spears in the nose.

282
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:11,799
- It's time for a new woman.
- But Kalle...!

283
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:17,353
There is something wrong with your mother,
but she should be here now.

284
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,239
- It was nice...
- Come on.

285
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,998
Yes. The girl must have her popsicle first.
- Come on.

286
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,917
- Is he all right?
- Mm.

287
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,718
- And at work?
- Mm.

288
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,111
This is good.

289
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,070
It's good he has you.

290
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,115
- Do you have a few bucks?
- Has the money gone already?

291
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,556
- Hell, I'm quite alone with the girl.
- Where to gangs.

292
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,712
Sorry. I need to rent.

293
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,672
Is he the right place?
The city's first free restaurant.

294
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,357
- What's he saying?
- Hi, Mom. No, I eat at home.

295
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,319
Ann-Marie had to do something with
banana.

296
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,472
- Sell the boat instead.
- No way.

297
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,316
I pay well.
It's coming yet never in the lake.

298
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,711
Obtain a little humor, dammit.

299
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,432
What the hell is wrong with him?

300
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:20,191
Father? What is proletarian?

301
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,195
Uh...

302
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:31,792
It is one that is struggling.
As living from hand to mouth.

303
00:40:33,879 --> 00:40:37,395
As do not own anything.

304
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:14,512
I and my husband
Noppe von Bavianrøv visited...

305
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:18,114
- What's the stupid place?
- Embassy District.

306
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:20,633
- Have you been there?
- No.

307
00:41:20,718 --> 00:41:25,792
Do woman man never visited
the finest bydel-

308
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:31,351
i all our great capital?

309
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:35,838
- Father?
- Wait.

310
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:40,754
Here are both Hitler's bathtub,
husneger and banquet dwarf.

311
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,514
All have space in my kingdom.

312
00:41:45,598 --> 00:41:49,478
- Ska 'we do not go now?
- We'll take one more, huh?

313
00:41:49,558 --> 00:41:53,267
- Uh...
- It's on the house.

314
00:41:55,718 --> 00:42:01,873
- Should she stay with us now?
- She may. Not so.

315
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:07,829
I was a promising football player sometime.
Tough but fair midterbak.

316
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:12,389
Girls sat close as birds on the battens.

317
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:18,109
Someone
I was not able to 'be wise to.

318
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,195
But I got her in the end.

319
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:23,756
Mother.

320
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:31,149
Capitalism is a disgrace, but
sometimes it's nice to ha 'money.

321
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:34,753
Now we take a taxi.

322
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:49,067
So. Skip down and check it,
then we will see.

323
00:43:01,757 --> 00:43:04,226
Come.

324
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:12,950
- You know what I think it looks like?
- No.

325
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:16,314
Door no. 24 in the Advent calendar.

326
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:19,947
Think then bitch are coming
and looking up.

327
00:43:20,037 --> 00:43:26,113
So they think: "Up there
lives a skillfully womenfolk."

328
00:43:28,757 --> 00:43:32,466
- Do you think?
- You think? I know.

329
00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:36,710
They never looked lovelier
curtains and sconces.

330
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:43,793
Damn, they are amazed
More than that here do not live a woman.

331
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:48,473
We live Sweden's best iron mold.

332
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,396
- Mother?
- Hello!

333
00:43:53,476 --> 00:43:55,467
Hello.

334
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:09,628
- Did you do it?
- We made it. Do you enjoy it?

335
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:12,993
Yes. It's fine.

336
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:21,027
- Are you coming up?
- Yes.

337
00:44:22,756 --> 00:44:27,068
- New curtains?
- Yes.

338
00:44:27,156 --> 00:44:30,433
I heard that you were foreman.

339
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:34,749
- What did you find out more?
- That it goes well with you.

340
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:39,194
- What's the foreman?
- I'll tell you later.

341
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:44,106
Hoof. Caution. Not on your stomach.

342
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:48,434
You must have a sibling.

343
00:45:34,755 --> 00:45:36,951
Father?

344
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:52,427
Tighten the muscles, Dad.

345
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:55,906
It's nerves.

346
00:45:56,955 --> 00:45:59,834
They go as long wires in the body.

347
00:46:01,715 --> 00:46:04,434
Tighten the muscles.

348
00:46:08,555 --> 00:46:11,274
Tighten the muscles.

349
00:46:57,914 --> 00:47:02,385
Admission? Hi, Grandpa.

350
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:05,387
Yes, we are awake.

351
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:11,709
Yes. It's good. Mm.

352
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:14,912
He eats breakfast.

353
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:20,669
Mm. Yes, we do.

354
00:47:21,634 --> 00:47:24,626
You too. Hey.

355
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:51,705
Father?

356
00:47:54,513 --> 00:47:57,585
Time to wake up.

357
00:47:58,553 --> 00:48:02,262
- Wake up.
- Yes. Yes, yes...

358
00:49:16,512 --> 00:49:18,708
Hello! Thank you.

359
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:22,786
- Mor'n, mor'n.
- Hey, hey.

360
00:49:26,752 --> 00:49:31,064
- Who is it?
- She's new. She is from Norway.

361
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:33,587
Spring up.

362
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:39,626
- What stuff!
- Yes.

363
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:43,990
- It's boat-Saturday soon.
- Yes, you did.

364
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,063
- Hi.
- Hello again.

365
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:49,144
- Should we look at the plates?
- I can not.

366
00:49:49,232 --> 00:49:54,147
You promised you so. I dare not without you.

367
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:57,941
- I need to check something.
- It's what you said last time.

368
00:49:58,032 --> 00:50:03,903
- I've cigars. Three pieces.
- I may come back.

369
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:25,705
- Goodbye!
- Hey, hey!

370
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:28,431
- Hello! Are you here?
- Yes.

371
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:31,185
- How fun!
- You look happy.

372
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:37,506
I'm happy! I am a happy shit.
Spring up. Spring is now up.

373
00:50:45,511 --> 00:50:49,425
Look at me. Look at me!

374
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:55,270
Breathe. Breathe!

375
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:59,390
- The potatoes are ready.
- I'm not talking to you.

376
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:03,749
- How long has this been going on?
- Leave her alone.

377
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:08,826
- Not a penny more.
- Can not we just eat?

378
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:12,791
Did you hear it too?
Not a penny more!

379
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:24,823
You hear hardly by grandpa?

380
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:30,384
He never pushed one Wallenberg
against the wall. It's just talk.

381
00:51:41,071 --> 00:51:44,301
I go in and...

382
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,068
- What do you think?
- Fine.

383
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,468
You should perhaps... The fly.

384
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,585
Nah...

385
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,826
- Well...
- Boo!

386
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,219
- Hello!
- Hello!

387
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:12,298
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, I must go immediately.

388
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,428
- You just got here.
- Yes...

389
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:20,668
Now it became tiresome.

390
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:26,668
- We greeted, or what?
- Jo.

391
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:34,101
What are we talking about?

392
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:39,506
- You are a hairdresser?
- Yes. Absolutely. And you are...?

393
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:42,308
- I go to school.
- Yes.

394
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,700
- In sixth.
- The sixth? Fine.

395
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,429
Sixth is fine.

396
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:58,628
- Nicaragua?
- Huh? What is it?

397
00:53:58,709 --> 00:54:02,782
- Nicaragua?
- No... Yes. Something with Olof Palme.

398
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:08,706
I hate Olof Palme. Oh, to cram
a bomb in his mouth on him and just...

399
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:11,941
Sweden has become so communist.

400
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:15,499
No one should be happy.
All must be equal.

401
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:31,428
But I think about you.

402
00:54:31,508 --> 00:54:37,026
I've seen you a few times in the area.
Quite often, actually.

403
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,941
're Good people.

404
00:54:49,388 --> 00:54:55,623
You're such a little... Tarzan...
Tarzan-like.

405
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:03,739
- You think so?
- Yes.

406
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,337
Hello?

407
00:55:08,588 --> 00:55:10,818
Hello!

408
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:15,059
- Hello!
- Hello!

409
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:18,903
- I thought to sleep here if it is okay.
- Of course! Cosy.

410
00:55:18,988 --> 00:55:23,221
One night only.
- Hey, girly girl! Good to see you.

411
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:25,584
- Is that fine?
- Yes.

412
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:31,459
I is shown by the working class!
I have abandoned my family.

413
00:55:31,548 --> 00:55:35,542
I'm not ashamed
appreciate workers!

414
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:38,427
We know what it means.

415
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:44,618
Social Democrats just leads to total
passivation of the working class.

416
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,940
- A holiday week extra, what is it?
- Filled stomachs.

417
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:54,500
Capital mislead the working class
with socialakrobaternes help.

418
00:55:54,587 --> 00:55:56,498
They are being exploited.

419
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:00,262
Father plungers 07:03
and stops 16.06.

420
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:04,705
He works eight hours, get paid
four. The rest takes Wallenberg.

421
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:07,905
That's it.

422
00:56:10,627 --> 00:56:12,538
You?

423
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:19,701
- Are you good at home?
- Yes.

424
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:23,496
- Safe?
- Yes.

425
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:28,624
You look like your father sometimes.

426
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:33,064
Dad says I look like you.

427
00:56:33,147 --> 00:56:35,343
Good night.

428
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:14,182
What do you think?

429
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:18,100
She has done well in winter.
Only a coat of varnish.

430
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:21,099
No, no. Sonja.

431
00:57:21,186 --> 00:57:26,625
- What do you think about Sonja?
- She is fun.

432
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:31,258
Thee so?

433
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:38,101
- Stop...
- I have not said anything.

434
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:45,986
- We begin with Pettersson.
- Damn. Come on!

435
00:57:46,066 --> 00:57:50,219
- It is not free to stand here.
- What SKUs we here?

436
00:57:52,746 --> 00:57:57,900
- Hello! Are you there?
- I do not think he's here.

437
00:57:57,986 --> 00:58:04,176
Are you coming, or what?
Your bike is here.

438
00:58:04,266 --> 00:58:07,577
- Sad I under...
- Yes, below!

439
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:11,217
You too?

440
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:15,982
So I have not had the boat in the water?

441
00:58:16,066 --> 00:58:18,023
Vasa?

442
00:58:19,226 --> 00:58:24,380
- What do you say?
- You did not get the boat on the water?

443
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:30,582
- What's she saying?
- It's all right!

444
00:58:30,665 --> 00:58:33,817
- Do you have stereo?
- Mm.

445
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:39,295
- Wow...
- Take more crayfish.

446
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:46,698
My favorite!

447
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:55,701
Relax a little.

448
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:18,978
- I just wanna live.
- Huh?

449
00:59:19,065 --> 00:59:23,343
- I want to live!
- What do you say?

450
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:26,816
I just want to live.

451
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:40,417
You're healthy now.

452
00:59:40,505 --> 00:59:43,463
It's just...

453
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:51,180
Excuse me...
Well, it's these pills...

454
00:59:52,984 --> 00:59:55,100
Sorry.

455
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:04,581
- So your father has girlfriend now?
- Yes. She stilettos.

456
01:00:04,664 --> 01:00:09,295
Here. Here is my girlfriend.
Him in the middle.

457
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:11,898
Now ska 'you hear.

458
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:23,097
- This is somewhat good?
- Yes.

459
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:04,060
There is a toilet.

460
01:01:32,143 --> 01:01:36,979
- There is no towel.
- Wipe up here. It's fine.

461
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:44,661
- Thank you. Do you have ice cream at home?
- No. Come on.

462
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:55,093
- My mother feel sorry for you.
- Why?

463
01:01:55,183 --> 01:01:58,892
- Because you have no mother.
- But you have no father.

464
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:01,623
It's not the same.

465
01:02:01,703 --> 01:02:05,936
- Are best friends and companions, then?
- What do you mean?

466
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:09,334
If you were, you'd know it.

467
01:02:09,423 --> 01:02:12,973
By the way, my mother
a new family now.

468
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,452
But what's up you?

469
01:02:18,143 --> 01:02:21,101
- What was that?
- Huh?

470
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:25,612
<i> Hey, my girl </i>

471
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,733
Is this you?

472
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:34,931
- I thought I heard voices.
- She SKUs ready to go.

473
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:37,457
We should welcome anyway.

474
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:42,776
Hello, is it perhaps
Miss Hottentot?

475
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:46,173
Or Countess Bavianrøv?

476
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:50,574
Sweet Miss, you have possibly seen
my company dwarf?

477
01:02:50,662 --> 01:02:52,619
Father...

478
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:57,094
I have to call the house Negro. Hello?
- We usually play bridge.

479
01:02:57,182 --> 01:03:01,619
What did I? What my answer is?
Here is my answer:

480
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:06,981
That's it. And a PS. Hey, hey.

481
01:03:11,382 --> 01:03:14,454
- Goodbye. See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

482
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:21,977
- Why were you at home yesterday?
- How?

483
01:03:22,062 --> 01:03:24,451
Middle of the day?

484
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:27,739
Yes, nay... It was the dragon.

485
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:32,013
- Why?
- It was hard yesterday.

486
01:03:32,102 --> 01:03:35,458
Why? Is this an interrogation?

487
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:43,260
I have a sore back.
Did the heat treatment and the whole thing.

488
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:46,095
Do you have a...

489
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:50,012
So...

490
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,932
I'll take a goldfish so.

491
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,096
Yes.

492
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:11,897
- Come on.
- No.

493
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:16,578
Who do I talk to, then?
There's just drønnerter here. Come on.

494
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:21,736
- No!
- What would you do?

495
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,456
Okay.

496
01:04:37,901 --> 01:04:42,816
- Hi. What have you bought? A fish?
- Yes.

497
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:45,290
How nice. Settle down.

498
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:50,660
- Thank you, Sonya.
- You were really nice. So we'll see.

499
01:04:50,741 --> 01:04:53,096
Now we see...

500
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:57,300
No, it is too red.
But this... Do we see.

501
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:03,617
Laugh not. So.

502
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:11,772
Do you want to run with us?
We have a boat, dad and me.

503
01:05:11,861 --> 01:05:16,058
We thought ta 'to Cuba,
but I do not think we get that far.

504
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,690
- Cuba is not for me.
- We ka 'to go' anywhere they go.

505
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,171
I need to travel.
For Mallorca.

506
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,254
Once a year, the
Viva España for all the money.

507
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,332
Did you tell dad?

508
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:37,131
I have something for you.
I just used it once.

509
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:41,532
It gets fine for you.
Do spit in it.

510
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,930
And then...

511
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:48,775
And then drag it over the eyelashes.

512
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:57,417
Your father sitting up there.
It stinks of piss all over the entryway.

513
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,970
- Get out!
- See for yourself.

514
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,937
Listen now! You can not sit.

515
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,618
You ska 'go now. I am here.
You ska 'go!

516
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:27,540
Do you hear bad, or what?
You ska 'go!

517
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:54,332
- Will you not Sonja?
- Take off your shoes.

518
01:06:54,419 --> 01:06:58,128
- Where is Sonja?
- She's leaving tomorrow.

519
01:06:59,139 --> 01:07:03,292
Intl. Do you understand?
She does not want you.

520
01:07:03,379 --> 01:07:07,976
- Where is she going, then?
- She does not like you so much!

521
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:11,734
Charter? What?
- Sit.

522
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:15,574
She... she must be careful.

523
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:21,496
Lying among flabby Germans shouting Sieg Heil
to their children.

524
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:26,938
She must be careful
she does not get a shit in your mouth.

525
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:37,739
Come and dance with the Swedish
remaining in the endowment.

526
01:07:37,819 --> 01:07:41,494
- No, no, no...
- Stop. Get off me.

527
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:44,412
- Stand on my feet.
- No.

528
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:47,537
Stand on your feet.

529
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:53,178
Father, stop. Stop! Slip.

530
01:07:54,499 --> 01:07:57,012
Stop. I will not!

531
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:04,132
Father, let me go. Then go though!

532
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:06,937
Daddy, stop!

533
01:08:16,778 --> 01:08:20,055
Release! Let me go!

534
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:24,177
Can not you just die damned old fool!

535
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:08,174
I think it's nerves.

536
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:16,011
They are long strands of body
and sometimes filter the contract.

537
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:21,047
So is he fucking bad.

538
01:09:26,137 --> 01:09:31,496
My mother's sister disappeared.
Drowned.

539
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:34,808
None grasped something.

540
01:09:34,897 --> 01:09:37,730
And they said it was nerves.

541
01:09:43,857 --> 01:09:46,212
I have to go.

542
01:11:29,896 --> 01:11:34,333
Father? Time to wake up.

543
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:44,533
Father?

544
01:11:48,456 --> 01:11:51,335
I made breakfast.

545
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:59,726
- I acted while you were sleeping.
- I guess there's not open yet?

546
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,933
Greek is on the corner is open.

547
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:13,131
- What do you want? Cheese?
- I would like to have a roll.

548
01:12:21,895 --> 01:12:24,887
- You want juice?
- Yes.

549
01:12:36,335 --> 01:12:38,895
Thank you.

550
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:45,249
You're welcome.

Everything entitled
"Twenty times in twenty society."

555
01:13:15,175 --> 01:13:20,203
- She has nothing to apologize for.
- Red propaganda is not on the table.

556
01:13:20,294 --> 01:13:24,811
But what about black propaganda
kristendomsundervisning-

557

guide organ tramp in the morning?

558
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:47,607
- Companion you hang out with...?
- It was my idea.

559
01:13:50,414 --> 01:13:54,203
I need to talk to her.

560
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:07,689
Why are you defending her? Vouch for
your belief something must change!

561
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:11,165
It was exactly this i...

562
01:14:12,134 --> 01:14:15,092
She is your daughter!

563
01:14:20,334 --> 01:14:22,894
- Sorry.
- No.

564
01:14:22,974 --> 01:14:27,047
- I thought it was funny.
- That was it. Damn funny.

565
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:30,286
It was fucking right in the eye.

566
01:14:31,254 --> 01:14:36,567
You may just be a little careful.
Otherwise it gives problems.

567
01:14:36,654 --> 01:14:38,884
Do you understand?

You can be an "unreliable element"
and ports in a labor camp in Norrland.

571
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:02,645
Lump of gold.
With you is to become something else.

572

You with your good head.

573
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:15,570
You may be exactly what you want.

574
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,887
Remember.

575
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:28,882
Now we go home.

576
01:15:33,853 --> 01:15:37,050
No, not here.

- Are you turned the light on?
- Mm.

583
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:27,206
- Where are the matches?
- They are there somewhere.

584
01:16:28,412 --> 01:16:31,370
No, I find them.

585
01:16:38,612 --> 01:16:40,888
Yes...

586
01:16:42,052 --> 01:16:46,683
That was it.
It was probably good enough.

587
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:49,969
We did not fit particularly well together.

588
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:55,809
To vote on threesome government
once ka 'acceptable, but two!

There is the limit fucking.

01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:19,129
You see how annoying you look like?

Meet at the boat later.

631
01:28:38,203 --> 01:28:41,002
Lump of gold?

632
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:16,952
"Shuffle the cards and place them in a pile
with instructions down."

633
01:29:17,043 --> 01:29:22,038
- "Each participant selects one piece."
- I'm blue.

634
01:29:24,643 --> 01:29:28,273
- You want green? Or red?
- Red.

635
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:33,152
"Game can begin.
The youngest player begins the letter A."

636
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:37,315
Ask your piece there.
Then you must strike first.

637
01:29:37,402 --> 01:29:40,520
- It's your father.
- Where?

638
01:29:40,602 --> 01:29:44,482
In the hall. He has a Christmas present with.

639
01:29:45,442 --> 01:29:48,958
- Jo.
- No. No!

640
01:30:21,762 --> 01:30:24,754
- Hi.
- Hello.

641
01:30:37,922 --> 01:30:41,711
Can you... give her that.

642
01:30:43,162 --> 01:30:46,393
- It's just a little...
- Yes.

643
01:30:50,642 --> 01:30:54,555
- Will not you come in?
- No, I gotta go.

644
01:30:57,601 --> 01:31:01,799
- Okay... Merry Christmas, so.
- Good July

645
01:31:05,241 --> 01:31:10,873
- This is a table... of Beauty.
- The white?

646
01:31:10,961 --> 01:31:17,719
- Yes. As you got from your father.
- Who stood in the bedroom?

647
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:23,194
Do I...

648
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:29,314
Can I move it?

649
01:31:30,521 --> 01:31:33,559
Is it here yet?

650
01:31:39,001 --> 01:31:41,754
- Hello.
- Hello.

651
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:46,472
- Will not you come in?
- No, I just wanted to drop...

652
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:50,715
Yes, maybe you...

653
01:31:50,801 --> 01:31:52,997
Thank you.

654
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:59,756
Why do not you sit here.
Just need cleaning up.

655
01:32:00,841 --> 01:32:06,393
Cleanup is not the girls' strong point.
So. Here you go.

656
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:13,317
Have a good time.

657
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,237
I close the door behind me.

658
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:48,878
It is an academic achievement,
outstanding performance. Or what?

659
01:33:48,959 --> 01:33:51,189
Yes.

660
01:33:58,359 --> 01:34:03,513
And you know why?
You have a unique perspective.

661
01:34:03,599 --> 01:34:08,673
As a PhD at the same institution
gets, I have to ask:

662
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:12,434
How the hell did you do?

663
01:34:12,519 --> 01:34:15,079
Cheers!

664
01:34:43,759 --> 01:34:48,993
I'm so proud of you.
Your father too, you know.

665
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:56,471
What you got there?

666
01:35:08,838 --> 01:35:13,071
Why had not I
keep up with tonight?

667
01:35:13,158 --> 01:35:15,718
Would you since?

668
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:25,228
I felt so sorry for him,
I gave him the finest I have had.

669
01:35:40,638 --> 01:35:43,107
Andersson.

670
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:47,112
Hello. It's me.

671
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:49,633
Is this you?

672
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:57,717
- Thank you for the money.
- Here you go, it was so little.

673
01:36:00,438 --> 01:36:06,832
- It was a long time ago.
- Yes. That was it.

674
01:36:07,838 --> 01:36:13,072
<i>... girly girl,
has not gone well? </i>

675
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:18,835
- Jo. Very well.
- Yeah, so...

676
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:25,914
So everything is as it should be.
When you become a doctor, you should be happy.

677
01:36:25,997 --> 01:36:30,434
- Promise me one thing.
- Yes?

678
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:34,954
Be zealous against professors
during deserten.

679
01:36:38,397 --> 01:36:39,751
Yes.

680
01:37:01,997 --> 01:37:05,353
- There I was quick.
- Yes.

681
01:37:05,437 --> 01:37:08,634
Hello. Come on.

682
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:22,472
- No, I can...
- Yes, I'll take it.

683
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,356
So. I have low coffee.

684
01:37:37,437 --> 01:37:40,713
- Do you drink coffee?
- Certainly.

685
01:37:40,796 --> 01:37:44,949
- Sugar, do you use it?
- No.

686
01:37:45,036 --> 01:37:52,033
No, that's good.
One should be careful with sugar.

687
01:38:00,276 --> 01:38:06,431
- Is it new?
- Yes. Lord, how I saved.

688
01:38:07,636 --> 01:38:10,549
There is very new.

689
01:38:10,636 --> 01:38:13,469
The renovated last.

690
01:38:14,436 --> 01:38:17,428
But it took a damn long time.

691
01:38:22,556 --> 01:38:25,070
I was getting fired.

692
01:38:27,036 --> 01:38:29,710
Yes, I heard it.

693
01:38:29,796 --> 01:38:34,313
The best as ku 'happen to me.
I ended completely with drinking.

694
01:38:37,316 --> 01:38:41,674
- Do you have milk?
- Did not I tell you about...? No.

695
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:44,748
Do you remember that?

696
01:38:45,996 --> 01:38:49,955
You said that there are dolphins in Cuba.

697
01:38:54,196 --> 01:38:58,429
Of course it was always pitch black
when we woke up?

698
01:39:00,275 --> 01:39:04,587
Of course, we were always alone
when we drove to kindergarten?

699
01:39:10,955 --> 01:39:14,914
And you picked me up every day.

700
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:26,788
I will always remember.

701
01:39:31,275 --> 01:39:34,666
It was dark and cold.

702
01:39:37,835 --> 01:39:41,669
It was a decent game,
it with Katya.

703
01:39:42,635 --> 01:39:45,548
I was not ready.

704
01:39:49,955 --> 01:39:53,073
I did the best I could.

705
01:39:55,315 --> 01:39:57,829
And you did good.

706
01:39:58,795 --> 01:40:03,471
Although you kicked as hell at night.

707
01:40:03,555 --> 01:40:06,673
They had the difficulty sleeping.

708
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:13,385
But... It was not bad for me.

709
01:40:14,395 --> 01:40:17,592
I got the you.

710
01:40:20,994 --> 01:40:23,463
We got each other.

711
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:36,663
I live in Uppsala now.

712
01:40:37,634 --> 01:40:40,467
I know.

713
01:40:42,874 --> 01:40:47,664
- Do you want my phone number?
- I already have it.

714
01:40:58,114 --> 01:41:02,506
You must be grandfather. A girl.

715
01:41:06,074 --> 01:41:10,989
Give her and that we must be
best friends and companions.

716
01:41:15,034 --> 01:41:16,945
Love you.

717
