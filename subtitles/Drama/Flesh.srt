1
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:32,481
... light the night, and every tune
seems to sound just right,

2
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:38,039
It's absolutely the place to be, making
Wikki Wakki down in Waikiki

3
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,194
Come with me, all you whoopee-makers,

4
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:47,851
all you wide-awakers, join me.
Oh boy, I just found a spot.

5
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:51,101
You're gonna like it a lot!

6
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:58,077
And it's far away, off in Honolulu,
where the hula hula greets you....

7
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,486
Hawaii is the place, get a smile on
your face!

8
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:09,133
And I want to go where they swing
their hips,

9
00:01:09,253 --> 00:01:12,360
that's where the sailors all shake their
ships,

10
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:18,157
you wouldn't blame me, if you could be,
making Wikki Wakki down in Waikiki!

11
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:25,954
You get a feeling of pure delight, your
head is reeling, your heart is light!

12
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:31,887
Your eyes are dancing with revelry,
making Wikki Wakki down in Waikiki!

13
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:37,651
You never saw, dresses of straw, like
they're wearing there...

14
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:43,763
And all those dances they do, there's
nothing you can compare!

15
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:48,631
What a revelation!
Hawaiian cuties, with goo-goo eyes!

16
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,954
And they are beauties,you'd be surprised
You're never lonesome for company,

17
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:58,632
Making Wikki Wakki down in Waikiki!

18
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:30,719
Say, you never saw, dresses of straw
like they're wearing there!

19
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:38,334
And all those dances they do, there's
nothing you can compare,what a revelation!

20
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:45,160
Hawaiian beauties with goo-goo eyes, oh
they are beauties, you'd be surprised!

21
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:52,302
You're never lonesome for company,
making Wikki Wakki down in Waikiki!

22
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,890
Son of a bitch!

23
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,582
Get up!

24
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,567
Up now!

25
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,707
I'll put this foot down here!

26
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,981
You're insane, you really are insane!

27
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,457
You're the one that's a fucking nut!

28
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:55,257
- Just leave me alone
- Now get up and go to work!

29
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:58,533
There's nothing to do now, there's
nothing to do, just leave me alone!

30
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:00,030
Oh really?

31
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,070
OK, I'll get up, I'll get up!

32
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,134
Now!

33
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,540
Get up now!

34
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,038
You've been sleeping in that damn bed
all day, and you've been out with those

35
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:25,616
dumb cunts, all night,

36
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:28,419
And then you waste your time watching
television....

37
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,642
- Yeah
- Get up!

38
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,647
I'm up!

39
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,955
Alright, get in the shower!

40
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,794
Come here! C'mere, talk to me...

41
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:52,943
- Aren't you getting up?
- Not yet....

42
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:58,020
My girlfriend's coming over, c'mon
you have to get dressed now.

43
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,205
- Don't you want to get up and see my
girlfriend? - I don't...

44
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,398
C'mon darling, get up...

45
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,190
But what am I going to do if I get up
now?

46
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,822
There's that pig on the phone!
- Who?

47
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,119
That filthy filthy pig that you know!

48
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,593
Who's that? I don't know any pigs!
- Yes you do!

49
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,587
- You know the pigs, I don't know any
pigs - A million pigs!

50
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:22,301
- You're the only one that knows pigs,
I don't.  - Where's my matches?

51
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,127
Get them, I'm, I'm going to ...

52
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,855
What are you going to do today,
what do I have to do?

53
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,897
You have to, uh....

54
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:37,094
do something with me!

55
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,751
Beautiful!

56
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,539
Why do you do that?

57
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:00,304
What are you doing? Clothes on...

58
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:14,635
Get it!

59
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:16,952
See you do that?

60
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,484
What do you do that for?\

61
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:22,676
Cause I like it!

62
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,752
Love to...

63
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,273
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

64
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,381
Why do I...?

65
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,049
always have to tell you when to do
my laundry?

66
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,818
To iron my shirt, to ask you if you did
it?

67
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,042
How can I....?

68
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,431
I can't yell at you, even, because...

69
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,403
You are really...

70
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,843
Will you please?

71
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:07,492
Will you please stop, please, stop!
Please!

72
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,887
They're dirty...

73
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,672
Do my laundry will you?

74
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,202
Without me asking just once?

75
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:30,727
I make you happy don't I? No?

76
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:35,474
What do I have to do to make
you happy?

77
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,074
Look it, if you want to make me, you
want to make me happy?

78
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:42,167
You really want to make me happy?

79
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,957
Do my laundry?

80
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,002
Oh yeah?

81
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:53,974
You know the kid?

82
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:57,306
She's got, you'll have to take her to
the doctor, you, you should be able to

83
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,934
take her, I'm sick of going to the
doctors and looking at all

84
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:03,007
those fucking old ladies, crazy old
ladies... - No, you go!

85
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,990
- I'm sick of...
- Sitting there looking at me...

86
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,250
- Well, it isn't my job
- No, it isn't my job!

87
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,407
- It's your job! No!
- Yes it is!

88
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,208
- You never do anything else!
- No!

89
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:15,522
My job is to make sure that I protect
the family, you know, that's all.

90
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,976
Make sure nothing happens to you

91
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:21,036
- You never protect any... - Sure, I
would never let anything happen to you

92
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:24,052
- Oh, you're so full of shit, yes
you are! - No, no,no...

93
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,627
- You are full of shit!
- I'm not full of shit!

94
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,458
- You are!
- Oh!

95
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:30,808
Don't you...

96
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,152
- any places to go, yeah
- Oh yeah....

97
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:38,519
- Go out and get some fucking money,
for Chrissakes! - I get enough money...

98
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,983
I not only need money for the house, I
need money... $200

99
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:44,697
For what?

100
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:47,488
For my girlfriend's abortion...

101
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:51,071
- $200?
- Yeah

102
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,908
Why do I have to give you $200 for
your girlfriend's abortion?

103
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,621
Because you have the money and I don't!

104
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:01,083
- Why do you have to give it to her?
- She really has to...

105
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,622
Because she has no-one else to
give it her!

106
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:11,938
So like you know, I'm not in the mood to
go down to 42nd street, you know.

107
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:16,326
Like, you know, I call up two or three
people and I make the money,

108
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,219
and I hand it over, and like I can't see
these people no more!

109
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:22,244
- All family... - So why would I want
to do that, you know?

110
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:26,034
- What happens if the baby gets sick?
- Go somewhere else and get it!

111
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,525
There's other places besides 42nd St.

112
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,608
You're just too spoiled, you know that?

113
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,287
- Yeah I know...
- Your mother teach you to...

114
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,619
I know I can't so.. when I'm out, you
watch, right?

115
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,808
When you're out. I'll watch.

116
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:42,050
- I can't hustle 25 calls a day...
- No let's do it the same time

117
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,148
We'll make the neighbour watch the baby

118
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,636
Or your mother can watch, she
doesn't do anything else!

119
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,171
She'd better just be sitting...
- Ain't ya a dumb cunt!

120
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,386
.. her number

121
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,885
- Oh yeah? What did you do with her?
-Yeah!

122
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,346
- I know all about your mother
-Oh yeah? My mother knows all about you!

123
00:11:01,984 --> 00:11:05,898
So like you know, you get the money,
but like...

124
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:11,739
- So what are you gonna get, $200 and
that's it. - No, I need some more money!

125
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,746
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

126
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:21,725
It's very painful, I like, you know...
don't like that kind of work!

127
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,462
- Are you going to do it?
- Yeah

128
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,362
When?

129
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:29,174
- Tonight
- Tonight?

130
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,695
- Are you sure?
- After your girlfriend leaves

131
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,814
- After my girlfriend leaves? Why not
before? - Yes.

132
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,930
Because, I wanna see her.

133
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,326
Oh, what'd you marry me for anyway?

134
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:44,255
- Cause you're a good fuck!
- Awww, thank you!

135
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,450
- I think I'm going to wrap it up,
honey... - You getting

136
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,057
- getting pretty embarrassed now...
Yes I think i'm gonna wrap it right up

137
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:54,231
- Guess she'll like that. Won't she?
- OK? She'll love it!

138
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:57,451
- See I got a package for you!
- Good things come in small packages!

139
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,087
- Right?
- Right.

140
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,386
Wrap it nice and pretty

141
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,296
Okay!

142
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, it looks so great wrapped up. Oh,
so scrumptious!

143
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:12,461
- All you have to... yeah it does
- Does it look good?

144
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,771
-Does it look pretty? - Oh it looks
so beautiful, a little bow on it!

145
00:12:15,891 --> 00:12:18,281
- A little bow?
- Gee it does wonders!

146
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,027
- Don't you like it? You don't?
- Mmm Hmm

147
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,813
- Do you like it honey, isn't it
beautiful? Yeah, beautiful.

148
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,345
Oh, wait until my girlfriend sees it,
she's gonna go wild!

149
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,373
She's gonna go insane!

150
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,953
Oh, isn't it the cutest little thing, oh
it's marvellous!

151
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:40,580
- Really?
- Just look at that!

152
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,989
It's the only way for it to be!

153
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:47,210
- Don't you like it?
- Now you're not going to get any!

154
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,940
Isn't this fantastic? Did we do this
before?

155
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,944
- No, I've never had...
- No?

156
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,855
- You're kidding!
- I was...

157
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,044
So, I'm going to get ready now,
get dressed.

158
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,713
- No!
- Yes!

159
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,750
I wanna sit and watch this pretty
package!

160
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,405
- No!
- Yeah!

161
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,309
- No, because I... I'm not getting...
- Oh, but it looks so good!

162
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:13,319
Since you are a...
- Oh, a harlot!

163
00:13:14,558 --> 00:13:15,897
Go on...

164
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,567
- Do you have that underwear?
- No, I...

165
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:22,514
Well how am I supposed to make any
money without clean underwear, the johns

166
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,576
- You can wear that, you know that's
better... - The johns won't see dirty...

167
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,069
You do, just get up and look at yourself

168
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,827
- It's marvellous! - No it
doesn't, it looks terrible...

169
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,452
Where's my underwear?

170
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,844
Oh, so marvellous, come out let
me see it!

171
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:49,430
No, that's terrible, I don't like
that...

172
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,581
- Oh, I love it!
- I don't like that!

173
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:54,597
- It's marvellous, come out!
- Where's my... no!

174
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:59,488
- Oh, don't take it off it looks really
great! - No, I need clean underwear!

175
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,009
- No, go watch Mitt today and then run
down to.. - No, you can wear anything..

176
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:05,092
- the dryer for...
- I wanna see it!

177
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,555
No, see it!

178
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:10,005
- Ain't it fabulous, but now go get
me, I need - I wanna see it!

179
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:13,472
I don't like you to have any underwear,
you'll have to wear that! - I need...

180
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,323
So much prettier wrapped up!

181
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:24,427
You have the underwear? I'll wash it
for you! - Go wash it!

182
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,829
- You... I know!
- You'll get looked at!

183
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,743
I waited, I let you wrap it up, I let you...
- No!

184
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,569
- Is that washed?
- No, come...

185
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:39,272
- Please don't grope it!
- Give it!

186
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,242
- Let's put it on your head!
- On the head!

187
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:43,831
Hey listen you, I'm gonna drop you
a line.

188
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:45,967
- Yeah
- Yeah.

189
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:49,052
I'd like to see you again.

190
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:53,165
Yeah well, you know, that can be
arranged!

191
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:56,017
You seem...

192
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,341
- really busy, so....

193
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,882
Well, so...
- Occupying the other room is....

194
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:03,438
Like to see you again, we're
really good together

195
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,368
Always walking around on....

196
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:11,135
- Ninth, and...
- Yeah, yeah...

197
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,365
- Okay
- Okay?

198
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:18,054
Hey listen I owe you some money!

199
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:23,138
- Alright
- Thank you

200
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:25,795
You're very welcome.

201
00:23:26,425 --> 00:23:29,690
- And, uh.. I'll see you again!
-Alright!

202
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,607
-Yeah, see you later..
- Yeah

203
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,612
- But, uh, why don't you check out,
you know, see if...

204
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:48,739
- Yeah, yeah
- Awake and that, ok?

205
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:53,261
- And this way I can leave.
- Oh yeah.

206
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:57,370
- Yeah, it's cool, it's ok

207
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,139
Alright, so...

208
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:02,276
- I'll be seeing you soon, alright!
- Alright.

209
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,910
- Thank you very much, really
- OK

210
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:07,803
- Bye
- Bye

211
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,107
Well, uh...

212
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,023
- Nothing actually
- You're not doing anything now?

213
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,037
Would you like a small job, two dollars?

214
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,311
Yeah.

215
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:49,429
Do you know anything about art?

216
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,682
- I did a little modelling, and, um..
- You did a little modelling?

217
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:56,146
- Haven't done much
- Now isn't that strange!

218
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:58,398
That's what I had in mind

219
00:25:58,518 --> 00:26:02,281
when I walked past you, I just saw you
standing there...

220
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,525
Well, maybe we can do something about
this.

221
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:11,309
Now, how much...money did you think
you... were worth?

222
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,611
Now I'd like to... make a hundred bucks

223
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:20,675
like, you know, I really need it for...
I have to make it anyway today somehow

224
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,848
A hundred bucks?

225
00:26:25,988 --> 00:26:29,128
Um, you'll have to take all your
clothes off for that, you know!

226
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:33,136
Oh, there's gotta be a cab somewhere!

227
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:37,331
Shall we walk out?

228
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,401
Here we are.

229
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,337
Well now.

230
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,709
I expect you'd like something to drink,
would you? - Yeah.

231
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:58,395
Go on then, stick them  there

232
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,051
Thank you

233
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,826
All these things are just strange,
aren't they? Do you like them?

234
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:10,888
A world of the imagination...

235
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:25,291
You've um, you were saying you have done
some of it before?

236
00:27:25,652 --> 00:27:29,085
- I mean, I can see that because you're
not self-conscious. - Mmm hmm

237
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:32,467
You take your clothes off, and that's
all, you're quite used to that.

238
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:36,001
That's a big barrier with some people,
takes hours to get the clothes off!

239
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,826
But here in the art world, what the hell,
it's got nothing to do with the outside

240
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:42,978
world, nothing whatever! It's in the
world of imagination.

241
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:46,918
And some of the biggest people are
athletes...

242
00:27:48,082 --> 00:27:51,963
Oh boy they're athletes who got there by
running faster than anyone else in the

243
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:56,229
world, by vaulting, by high pole. by
crossing over the bar, all those things

244
00:27:56,443 --> 00:28:00,800
And the greatest of them were the Greeks
But they are people you see! Now...

245
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:06,178
I don't care who you think of, whether
it's Michelangelo or...

246
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:10,069
a collage or the Cistine Chapel, it looks
as if he's taken all his boys and

247
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,247
stuck them up there, and then, you know,
painting some of...

248
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:17,909
or whether you go to the Greeks.. which
reminds me of a , ummm...

249
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,450
- Hermes the name?
- Yeah.

250
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, he's a... he's a god, holding a
little kid...

251
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,723
in his arm, and he's dangling a bunch
of grapes...

252
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,537
the most wonderful face,

253
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:37,894
And previously the statues were made, to
look like your muscle boy covers you know

254
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,415
Marvellous figures and all this sort of
business.

255
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:44,657
This, this statue suddenly appeared,
and it was a person.

256
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,654
In fact the Greeks invented a word
entirely for that,

257
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:52,250
'synphatica' sympathy

258
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,008
empathy, all these words, they come from
Greek statues

259
00:28:55,128 --> 00:28:59,292
I think he won about five things, for
his little town, he come from

260
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,762
you see, and the town was given a
tremendous honour

261
00:29:01,882 --> 00:29:04,002
and he's a very beautiful young man,

262
00:29:04,122 --> 00:29:07,829
And somebody who had some money there
had a wife in Athens

263
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:10,402
And the night before the last games,

264
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:14,093
she made a date with him in one of the
temples and she gave him some dope,

265
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:17,117
the love philtre, cause she saw his
naked...

266
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:21,406
He fell for him, hook line and sinker,
and he wrote some of the world's most

267
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,902
marvellous odes just like, like
Shakespeare did too, about this guy.

268
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:28,066
Yeah, Praxiteles

269
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:31,173
who was the best sculptor, was...

270
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:35,558
But I'm talking about, you want to work
for someone like Michelangelo, like

271
00:29:35,678 --> 00:29:37,686
these are the sort of people he goes for

272
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:41,626
- You know, I...
- We are right...

273
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:45,349
I never really thought of it like that..

274
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:51,979
- Well, let's get started anyway, it's
getting late - Yeah, yeah...

275
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:53,927
It's good to know that, really

276
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:56,212
Take it easy, don't worry, it's not
all done in a day

277
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:59,544
Now you've got the idea of what picture,
the image...

278
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,361
-you can fill it in
- right

279
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:05,414
That's to give you some pride in your
job, and in your location.

280
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:10,619
So, let's start with a Greek statue.

281
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:14,142
I don't know what...
A greek statue.

282
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:18,926
And um... the shot, the discobolus. the
discus

283
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,446
thrower, the fellow who throws the disc,
you might do very well with that,

284
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:27,917
You've got that sort of torso, taut body
so we'll start with that.

285
00:30:29,386 --> 00:30:32,119
Well we'll try this, this... discobolus
thing

286
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:36,964
and I'll show you what you have to do,
why... stand on the bed!

287
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:42,452
You have to be above my level, that's why
you're standing at my eye level, you see

288
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:46,618
Now, you're going to throw this thing
like a plate, you know, a plate.

289
00:30:46,738 --> 00:30:48,104
in that direction.

290
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:50,941
So first of all... You're going
to take that off...

291
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:55,538
But now this back line, try and get all
the back muscles into this...

292
00:30:55,992 --> 00:31:00,011
Right there, down here, cause that's
what I want, close to my form, body...

293
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,960
Now take your shirt and things off

294
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:12,337
I think you'd better take everything off
in one flash

295
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:14,532
You should have done that before really

296
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,484
Give them to me

297
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,102
That's right, that's only right.

298
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,406
How the hell do you get out of those
things?

299
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,445
So I have to change it all...

300
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,535
- You do that?
- Yeah

301
00:31:43,365 --> 00:31:44,884
Right...

302
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,327
Right...

303
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:56,496
That's right, that's fine... you don't
have to move that.

304
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,623
That's the lucky charm.

305
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,444
You've got to work on the muscles there
and there.

306
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:06,072
What you can do by, that's the very thing
we're doing, by discus-throwing.

307
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,023
If you practice discus-throwing, walk,
throwing anything like that,

308
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:14,762
You will produce these, these side
muscles that come out and look very good

309
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:18,306
So...

310
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,166
Alright, throw it... throw it in either
direction, I don't mind which direction.

311
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:29,962
Picture.. in the middle, although doing
that, so forget all about it, just...

312
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:38,415
Back up for another one

313
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:41,510
That's fine, that's one... that's one
thing

314
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:46,115
So, what are you going to do with
those pictures you've been taking?

315
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:49,916
I make large drawings from the pictures

316
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,051
And the negatives, I'll give them to you
if you like, in the darkroom

317
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,407
That's fine.

318
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:58,218
- Tired? It's the same with the....
- Why don't I sit down...

319
00:32:58,338 --> 00:33:00,413
Put that aside, you can sit down...

320
00:33:01,078 --> 00:33:02,473
There it's got...

321
00:33:02,593 --> 00:33:04,421
Of, of movement.

322
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:06,819
Here you're standing, now...

323
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:09,408
Here's another famous statue like that.

324
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:13,154
Put your foot across there, bend forward
get forward a little bit more,

325
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:16,842
And pick some.... Those famous statues
people will recognise...

326
00:33:17,304 --> 00:33:21,658
OK, now turn around sideways, put both
feet up,

327
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:26,678
And bring, bring your heels in as close
to underneath you as you can.

328
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:29,395
And, keep your balance, lean forward.

329
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:33,324
And rocks, see, that's another one.

330
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:37,275
Good. Another one - you may have
seen them, put your arms around...

331
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,659
No, you gotta put out that, right...

332
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:43,847
Now kneel...kneel down on one knee and
throw the other leg up right behind you

333
00:33:44,182 --> 00:33:46,760
Like um... hang on.

334
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:53,123
Now that... that is like a starting,
start of a race.

335
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:57,243
You begin like that don't you, and then
the thing comes, and you, and you...

336
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:02,116
You, what do you do when you're in a
race, you, put your hands down first!

337
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:06,212
And you've got to hold that, is that a
strain on you?

338
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:08,775
- Little bit - Cause I might say you've
got to hold that ten minutes.

339
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:10,404
You're a runner...

340
00:34:11,057 --> 00:34:13,072
And you're going to take off!

341
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:20,081
When I say relax you can go down on...
go down on your knees and take it off

342
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:22,896
Now good, alright relax, go down
on your knees.

343
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:26,115
Now...

344
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,668
One sec.

345
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:32,428
Well if you could only stay like that for
thirty-five minutes that'd be splendid!

346
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:36,288
- I'll just use this for a while
- OK.

347
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,858
OK, you got that one?

348
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,897
Right so we'll move onto another one,
that's alright?

349
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:46,810
- Yeah, alright.
- Alright.

350
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,740
Just relax, yes but now I'm too close

351
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,179
So um, what shall we do now, another
pose?

352
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,387
Well, we'll do that other one I was
doing, the runner, alright?

353
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,333
You've sat all the time, can you lie
diagonally....

354
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:16,810
No, we'll do the runner one, OK?

355
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:19,212
- The runner?
- Yeah, we'll do that one.

356
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,600
- And we'll get it out of..
- Alright, turn round again.

357
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,059
You can hold that... if you want
to give in,

358
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:29,806
and then drop it, and then go back
to it, you see because,

359
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:33,082
the whole picture, if I do a picture of
this thing will take quite...

360
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:35,916
quite a while, so...

361
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,195
Lie flat on...

362
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:44,768
Alright, pick this thing up in the
morning...

363
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:49,597
Well, that's good, now that's going
better.

364
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:53,267
For general development, swimming is
the best.

365
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,579
I think, from my... it's the best, eh...

366
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:00,474
Nobody's ever, in my opinion, beaten
Johnny Weismuller.

367
00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:02,781
who was an Olympic swimmer.

368
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:07,813
In a liberated person, a person makes
himself whole

369
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,502
Body worship

370
00:36:09,761 --> 00:36:14,522
is the whole, I think the whole thing
behind all art, all music,

371
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,863
and all sex, and all love.

372
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:21,273
If you cut it out, for any reason,

373
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:27,248
you've deprived yourself of one
great chunk of life.

374
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:33,507
just as the people who say they don't
dig rock and roll.

375
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:35,927
But it's all, all vitally important

376
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:41,824
That... whether you just look at it with
the rotten view of making money

377
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:45,121
in other words popularity and success,
if you want the millions

378
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:48,110
to take an interest in you, it's done in
the same way as making one person

379
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,487
take an interest in you, that body
worship

380
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,970
is in... is in the makeup of the human
animal.

381
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:58,639
All human beings, whether they are
puritanticals or whatever they are!

382
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:03,113
They love it!They all come to the theatre
come to the films, they all dig it!

383
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,585
and they all get what they call the sex
kick

384
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:10,311
which is bullshit, there's no sex in it,
it's body worship which becomes sex.

385
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:15,311
It's like if I pick up a violin, and
I can't play the damn thing,

386
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:18,841
what hell use is it, might even be a
Stradivarius, wouldn't be any good.

387
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,022
- You've got to have the music!
- What are we having for dinner?

388
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:24,463
- Yes. Food!
- Alright.

389
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:30,164
That's the other thing, food and sex go
together, body again.

390
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:33,365
It's a worship, it's..
The door...

391
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,198
After all some deities and...

392
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,956
they became rituals you
worship

393
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,708
Now if this question bothers you...

394
00:37:47,828 --> 00:37:51,713
Say you've got a lovely body and
somebody else hasn't got a lovely body

395
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,540
You can't worship yourself, you see
what...

396
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,699
..receive there often.

397
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:10,855
Let's say one doesn't know what to do
about it,

398
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:14,544
If there's... are some friends around,
boys and girls,

399
00:38:14,664 --> 00:38:17,707
and they're all madly in love, and they
all have frightful problems,

400
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:21,111
and it's always the same kind of problem.
They can't get anywhere.

401
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:24,853
They don't seem to get any satisfaction.
And when they do have a good time.

402
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,847
it's always the sort of promise of
something that never comes off.

403
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:31,627
and so it's always the same, the great
question is what are you going to do

404
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:34,126
about it?. Adoration...

405
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:37,953
He literally, to himself in the mirror..

406
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:43,466
Am I talking to an empty bed? Oh fuck.

407
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,617
Hey what are you doing?

408
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:51,029
Oh Christ, he hasn't locked himself out
in the street without any clothes has he?

409
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:54,801
- Joe?
- Coming!

410
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,285
That's pretty good.

411
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,120
That's good.

412
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,701
You know what I can't stand about it,
the bloody age we live in,

413
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:08,033
They give expensive educations,

414
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:13,663
and don't give a hell if they give birth
to no more craftsmen, no more...

415
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:15,822
Nice day isn't it? How long you guys
been out here?

416
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:19,976
Half an hour, somewhere around there...

417
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:22,110
- Half hour?
- Yeah

418
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:27,367
- That's not, it's... what you meet
anybody, make anything? - No...

419
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:30,766
No it's a bad part, there's not many
people around, you know...

420
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:34,711
Well that's all that, you know, I got
home, I said that's all I wanna do

421
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:37,372
Like I don't wanna make another scene so
I had to, make up work

422
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:38,678
keep that mind work...

423
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:42,438
- No, I work. Yeah
- Yeah, you bum. Work, work.

424
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:45,463
Shit. Nobody works.

425
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,289
..there, a scene.

426
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,375
- You straight?
- Eh, nobody's straight

427
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:55,547
- What's straight, It's not a thing...
- Yes there is, shit...

428
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:59,127
to be straight, or, or, or being
not-straight,

429
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:02,591
It's just, you just do whatever you
have to do!

430
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:08,444
- Yeah, but it's tough - Yeah, it's hard
it's hard to learn how to do that

431
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:13,287
But once you got that down pat, like,
don't even worry about it no more because

432
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,806
Well, well look do you, what do you
consider yourself, do you consider

433
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:20,641
yourself abnormal?

434
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:24,963
What other people think doesn't matter,
you know, if you have to care about what

435
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:29,854
the straight people, what they're going
to think man, then you're not in your bag

436
00:41:29,974 --> 00:41:33,137
- Do you care? Do you really care?
- Yeah, I care, I mean...

437
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,692
I guess it's because I'm just starting
out.

438
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:38,900
Well it takes, time, yeah, well
how long you been...

439
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,003
- you know, really into it?
- I, just a couple weeks like I said

440
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:46,661
Did you ever have that...

441
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,380
You get into it because, why did you
get into it, first of all,

442
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,576
- Why did you even start?
- To make bread, I came to this city,

443
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:55,851
but like, you can make...
Wow, it's for bread, man.

444
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,933
- How much money do you make a week?
If I wanted to go out every day and do it

445
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:05,483
I can make close to... 150, 175, 185,
you know

446
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:08,907
If you want to do it every day, four times
a day you can make an awful lot of bread

447
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,089
I don't do it, I do, you know, I go
home and the wife says, 'Hey'

448
00:42:12,209 --> 00:42:16,161
You know, like, I went out today and met
this artist, man, and like,

449
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:20,027
He wants me to stand there and do some
photos, so I got a free dinner out of it

450
00:42:20,147 --> 00:42:24,034
I got my wife to come over, get a free
dinner get some food and stuff like that

451
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:26,380
But doesn't your wife get uptight about
it?

452
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,656
- Why should she get uptight man, it's
feeding her, isn't it? - Yeah...

453
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:33,123
Why should she care, like, she knows
where I'm at, man.

454
00:42:33,443 --> 00:42:37,090
She knows where I'm at, like, we have
a kid already man, and, like...

455
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,443
You know, so, uh...

456
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:45,605
I mean it's just being small, and not
knowing, where it's...

457
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:50,148
What people are doing, you know.. you
have to do, don't follow everybody...

458
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:54,133
do more or less what you want to do, and
what you like to do is make bread, right?

459
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:56,186
-Make cash, right?
- Yeah, right.

460
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:58,911
So the easiest way to do it is, you know
what you're doing here,

461
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:01,973
looking for those dirty old men as
they walk by, right?

462
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:07,060
- How much do you get on one job?
- Well I got this, well, it's one job..

463
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:12,165
Most of your jobs are from $20 to $30,
you know, most of them.

464
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:16,823
But like, you can get one like I got
today, right, get one like that...

465
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:20,726
Well, you make yourself a hundred bucks,
right?

466
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,260
- That's crazy!
- Oh well everybody's a little crazy!

467
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:31,326
What about that guy over there, do
you think I should get a job with him?

468
00:43:32,642 --> 00:43:35,873
- See now look, he's, he's got...
- Dressed like a pig.

469
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:38,743
- Like people dress sporty, right, they
wear sports clothes - Yeah, right.

470
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,906
- You don't wear a dirty t-shirt!
- Oh, well...

471
00:43:42,026 --> 00:43:44,559
Well how much did you make today,
maybe, did you make...

472
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:47,764
- Oh what, what was the last...
- I show it to you sometime

473
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:52,710
Like you know that thing... wasn't
that thing ugly?

474
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,288
Look at this one over here man, wow...

475
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,455
- Won't that get you bread?
- Stop it...

476
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:01,871
I know see but you don't worry, it's
only going to suck your peter, man

477
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:04,246
- A lot of men, like, fuck that scene
- But...

478
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:07,355
- How do you know he's got any bread,
I mean real bread? - Aww, shit

479
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:11,162
- I mean he really doesn't look very
rich to me - Yeah.

480
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:15,146
Well you just got to play it right...
Oh yeah, you think about...

481
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:17,430
- You go to, you went to school down
there? - Yeah.

482
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,106
- And you just got, couldn't take it, eh?
- No, no it was...

483
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:25,271
- Well I took it till I graduated, did
you graduate? - No.

484
00:44:25,391 --> 00:44:30,030
- Didn't you? - I got up to the
eighth grade, that's about it...

485
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,538
- Then they sent me off to reform school
- Reform school, for what?

486
00:44:33,658 --> 00:44:35,972
Ah, used to steal cars...

487
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,575
Fuck that shit, can't follow it no more

488
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:42,379
Yeah, but uh, did you spend all your
time in one school or what?

489
00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:46,103
- No, I was in high school in two schools
- Oh, you in high school in two schools?

490
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,131
- Yeah, in Wisconsin
- Wisconsin, and Alabama?

491
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:53,619
- Beautiful, beautiful.  - Yeah, not so
beautiful, I hated high school.

492
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:56,422
And uh, maybe split home for a while

493
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,637
And you say whatever you want to say to
them, and like you want to meet them,

494
00:45:00,757 --> 00:45:05,034
I heard a lot about you mister, that
whole bag, you do that whole scene

495
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:09,093
But, like, it's bad standing around like
all three of us, it's no good

496
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:11,558
We'll never make no money that way,
really.

497
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:16,397
- Wow - But you couldn't just take
me along some day?

498
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:20,044
Oh yeah, I'll do that.. how beautiful
you are, like...

499
00:45:20,164 --> 00:45:22,048
How much do you seriously...?

500
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:24,225
Find a good street corner's a good
idea, you know

501
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:26,459
- You know, you find a good street
corner... - But where?

502
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:29,565
- Well.. - I didn't really know where
to look, you know...

503
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:33,753
-Well actually, down by the '50s...
- This is new to me...

504
00:45:33,873 --> 00:45:36,643
That news stand down there man, 'bout
Third avenue?

505
00:45:36,857 --> 00:45:40,088
- That's a good area, it's a good area
to stand.  - 50 what?

506
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:43,698
Uh, think around 56th Street, 55th
Street.

507
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:46,096
- Right?
- Yeah.

508
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:48,559
But, how will I know the news stand?

509
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,013
- Well you see it's the only one there
on the corner. - I know, but...

510
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,098
- There's an outlet stand like that...
- Isn't there another news stand?

511
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:56,432
- fairly near?
- Yeah, pretty close.

512
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:59,674
Isn't there a drugstore nearby, or
something like that?

513
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:02,176
- Oh there must be
- Or a telephone booth?

514
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:05,300
- That you could tell me about, that
I know. - Yeah.

515
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,832
Gibbys, or something like that.

516
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:10,348
- You'll see it. I'll show it to you
sometime.  - Yeah.

517
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:14,265
- You know, your best bet is standing
where you were, because like somebody

518
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:17,478
No, like, I was standing there several
hours and nothing happened...

519
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:20,337
- 58th street
- I mean this is really a bad park.

520
00:46:20,956 --> 00:46:25,383
Yeah well they have these pictures down
there, the four big poster pop pictures

521
00:46:25,503 --> 00:46:27,933
Yeah down there's good, good idea.

522
00:46:28,732 --> 00:46:32,230
- Catch you around there, ok?
- Yeah, I'll see ya. Right.

523
00:46:53,983 --> 00:46:58,013
Hello David? Hi. Joe.

524
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:02,037
Look, uh, you gonna be home for
a while?

525
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:04,213
Yeah?

526
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:08,772
What you say I stop over later on?
Okay?

527
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,413
Right, yeah.

528
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:14,756
So I'll see you in about, maybe,
twenty minutes.

529
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,012
If everything's alright. Right.

530
00:47:19,392 --> 00:47:22,431
Yeah. Alright. Right.

531
00:47:23,489 --> 00:47:27,418
Right. Yeah. Ok then, right, bye bye.

532
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:28,825
Right bye.

533
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:35,419
You're so right. She's going to be a
big star.

534
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:42,621
Veronica was inspired by... the orient.

535
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:47,323
Here she's showing a chiffon negligee
embroidered in silver.

536
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:52,999
I love to kiss your satin-smooth face.

537
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:56,229
Too bad a dry skin causes you lines and
wrinkles too soon.

538
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,267
Are you referring to me?

539
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,631
Durgan's face cream.

540
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,571
Big stuff, he's big stuff alright!

541
00:48:06,932 --> 00:48:09,879
Eugene Palant. I work in a Bulmers
factory.

542
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:12,760
I can't afford to slow up a single
minute.

543
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:15,977
No matter what day of the month it is,
so believe me, I need more comfort

544
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:17,767
now than I ever did

545
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:22,776
That 3 out of 4 women voted 'Modest'
softer. I got a box quick!

546
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:28,762
Does exercise make women muscular,
Geri?

547
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:34,253
Don't you believe it!

548
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,628
When is a tampon right for you?

549
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:40,498
Battle of the bulge!

550
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:47,549
You know they try and tell you that it's
all exercise, these beauties are

551
00:48:47,669 --> 00:48:50,442
- starved to death!
- Oh, I don't know.

552
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:52,581
They have diets!

553
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,890
Personality demands its daily duty

554
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:04,616
You know this magazine is falling apart.

555
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:09,104
I'm proud of my figure now.

556
00:49:09,791 --> 00:49:11,851
Loses 17lbs in six weeks!

557
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:17,094
She's, she's trash!

558
00:49:18,107 --> 00:49:19,558
That's a good idea!

559
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:24,082
I like it when...

560
00:49:25,027 --> 00:49:28,292
We should act natural the way Jane
Frazee does!

561
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:31,553
She's an up and coming girl about town
these days, now Geri listen!

562
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:33,377
No wonder, as witness

563
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:36,308
the figure she cuts in a chiffon
negligee

564
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:41,142
And Jane's winning cheers for her acting
in 'Moonlight Masquerade'.

565
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:44,400
- She looks like a masquerade!
- I'm telling you, look!

566
00:49:44,892 --> 00:49:46,941
The lowdown, on high...

567
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:50,611
She knows how, Anne Jeffreys, she knows!

568
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,265
- She knows how to lose weight!
- I'll look at it later if I'm bothering

569
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,934
We're trying to educate you, here!

570
00:49:59,238 --> 00:50:02,289
-Don't you want to learn to be glamorous?
- Ah, Candy...

571
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:05,359
Geri, that's a very petty trick, you
know.

572
00:50:05,685 --> 00:50:08,297
Trying to make the likes of me
jealous!

573
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:11,525
I'm not trying to get you jealous!

574
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:14,756
I'm trying to make your friendlier, or
you can ignore me!

575
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:20,272
Isn't she wretched?

576
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:23,466
- She's told us
- She'll come to a bad end!

577
00:50:24,423 --> 00:50:26,821
It's a hot box in here, how would
Lucille..?

578
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:30,621
She's a prestige star.

579
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:33,311
I don't know.

580
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:39,597
I mean, she was a band leader, and the
girl most likely to succeed, in 1942.

581
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:42,356
She looks like Olga San Juan.

582
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:44,783
I think it was, Olga San Juan, she...

583
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:47,248
Did you see her when she played Amber
La Vonne?

584
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:51,688
- Calling Amber La Vonne? Did you
see that? - No!

585
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:55,009
Oh look at this, it's falling
everywhere...

586
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,868
Soaping...

587
00:50:58,203 --> 00:51:00,904
You know you can get so hung up with
these magazines.

588
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:05,430
- Oh she loves Anne Sheridan
- Mmm.

589
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:10,165
Juke Girl, starring Ronald Reagan, Anne
Sheridan, and Richard Whorf

590
00:51:10,285 --> 00:51:13,732
- Do you know, she made me stay up all
night - The tale of two hitchhikers

591
00:51:14,076 --> 00:51:17,937
Who wander into the Florida tomato
country, and get mixed up

592
00:51:18,057 --> 00:51:21,214
There's nothing like being dull, by
Jackie Curtis

593
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:23,345
Where's that?

594
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:27,983
Only kidding...

595
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:34,554
All these pages have 'Buy War Bonds' on
them.

596
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,892
Aren't you going to pay any attention
to us?

597
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:43,147
Do you know any poems? I'm
starving for culture.

598
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:59,276
- Joe?
- What?

599
00:51:59,396 --> 00:52:02,788
- ... a nice handkerchief?
- Oh, it's a beautiful handkerchief!

600
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:05,866
- Would you like a cigarette, Joe?
- Yeah. Oh stop.

601
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,925
Open your mouth.

602
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:22,019
How could you? Right in front of
all of us!

603
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:25,835
How could you not watch and sit still
reading magazines,

604
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:29,313
-that's the most disgusting of all!-Don't
you know the angels are watching you?

605
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:32,673
They're doing it too!

606
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:36,857
- Well, they're used to watch...
- She didn't mind!

607
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,071
You know Joe...

608
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:48,851
You'll never get to heaven if you...

609
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:52,563
I don't want to go to heaven anyway.

610
00:52:55,453 --> 00:52:59,460
- I have a frog in my throat
- No, it can't be Joan watching you.

611
00:53:00,192 --> 00:53:02,477
- It was Joan!
- Joan Crawford!

612
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,875
Oh, she's done it too.

613
00:53:07,834 --> 00:53:11,560
What did you just say? Joan Crawford?

614
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:16,022
- have a habit... - I said I don't
mind her watching, she understands.

615
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:20,124
- You better go and call... - Why Joan
Crawford is one of my favourite stars.

616
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:23,096
She'd only be good enough to pick up
her glove!

617
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:32,582
- I wish the phone would ring, I need
some money!  -Can't you make some

618
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:33,832
phone calls?

619
00:53:34,517 --> 00:53:38,288
I wish you, I tell you something Geri,
it's so frustrating...

620
00:53:42,363 --> 00:53:47,111
I want to be a vampire! That's why I
have this outfit on, notice this smooth

621
00:53:47,415 --> 00:53:49,598
I love horror things!
- Splendid!

622
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:53,768
Don't you feel guilty, Joe?

623
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,544
You do feel guilty?

624
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:04,112
Why do you feel guilty?

625
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,645
Joe, we had so much fun...

626
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,864
We were stuck in this hotel in Chicago,
what was the name of it....

627
00:54:10,984 --> 00:54:13,374
The Carling hotel, right Joe?

628
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:17,156
The Carling. How much did we owe there?

629
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,587
About $50 or $60 and we didn't have the
money so

630
00:54:21,707 --> 00:54:26,270
he threw the luggage out the window!
And it was in that snowstorm!

631
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:29,027
The cat, and all.

632
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:34,858
Then I had to run and climb a six foot
fence. Remember Joe?

633
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:39,931
Remember what you said before about what
you did for Joe?

634
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:43,495
At the door, and I just slammed the door
in your face and said I'll be back?

635
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:46,632
Well, I never told you, but that night
I got raped,

636
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:49,931
and you wanted me to make love to you
right after I got raped,

637
00:54:50,051 --> 00:54:53,465
and you almost broke up with me cause I
wouldn't... and...

638
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:59,031
his name was Mikey, and he said that he
would ruin my face unless I went with him

639
00:54:59,151 --> 00:55:02,721
or he'd bang on the door and get you out
and he was much bigger than you,

640
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:06,073
So I said OK, I'd go cause I didn't want
anything to happen to you,

641
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:08,433
and he dragged me to this filthy hotel

642
00:55:08,553 --> 00:55:11,522
and he made me do everything, and then
he called up some other guy and

643
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,674
made me do something to him, and the
other guy was like really nice

644
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:17,882
and I said 'Please let me go!' and he
wouldn't!

645
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:21,320
And they both like made me do everything
to them! And he said if I just did it

646
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,820
to them once, he'd let me go and he lied
and later he made me do it again

647
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,970
and then I was just crying, and then he
finally drove me home,

648
00:55:30,342 --> 00:55:34,155
and I said I don't want him to drive me
home, just let me go.

649
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:37,003
and so he let me go, and now when
I dance,

650
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:41,524
up the club, up at the lake, you know
where I dance topless, he was there!

651
00:55:41,644 --> 00:55:45,045
Do you know what it's like to dance
topless in front of someone who raped you?

652
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:47,513
And that, that was how I got him back!

653
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:50,660
Cause, like he didn't think I'd have the
guts to dance in front of him,

654
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,622
I just danced the best I could to say,
this is what you didn't get,

655
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:58,792
cause like when he raped me I was real
stiff, and I danced fantastic,

656
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:02,889
so that he knew, if he would have, you
know, got me to dig him,

657
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:07,944
he would have had it out of sight, but
because he took it, I was awful.

658
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:12,327
And that's how much I love you, I
wouldn't let them hurt you.

659
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:18,547
- But it was fun!
- What was fun? Getting raped?

660
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:23,433
Yeah. At the time it wasn't but now that
I think about it, it was weird.

661
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,145
Oh, look at my hair.

662
00:56:27,674 --> 00:56:30,398
- I like it!
- It's terrible!

663
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:33,539
- I like it!  - Do you believe
this hair colour cost $10?

664
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:37,749
- Ten dollars!
- But you can do it yourself!

665
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:41,284
Andre did it, Andre of Paris on
5th Avenue.

666
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:44,553
- Why don't you do it yourself, it's so
easy! - I'll kill that queen Andre!

667
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,236
Well I don't like a set look, you know.

668
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,665
I don't like anything that looks too
set, I like things a little...

669
00:56:54,419 --> 00:56:58,246
and things that move, I think things
that move are beautiful.

670
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:02,679
- Like your, your bust, it moves.
- It does!

671
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:06,815
- Cause you don't wear a bra. Do you
have a bra? - Yes!

672
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,744
It still moves.

673
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:16,074
Pretty soon it won't move because I
want to get a silicone shot.

674
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:19,226
Like I want to be really big
- Oh don't, you shouldn't.

675
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:22,889
No, like now I'm proportionate, and
I want to be, you know a little extra

676
00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:26,221
Oh don't... Statues in Greece.

677
00:57:27,324 --> 00:57:29,846
- Yeah
- When they, when they...

678
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:33,321
All those beautiful statues, they don't
have... big...

679
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:36,338
tits like a cow!

680
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,285
- They won't... willowy
- Yes but if one of those

681
00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:42,797
-  statues did it would stand out!
- Let me see what your bust looks like

682
00:57:44,487 --> 00:57:45,962
Okay.

683
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:00,033
Oh I want to get silicone shots, cause I
know they're too little, especially

684
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:01,980
for dancing topless...

685
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:05,814
Oh don't be a fool, you already die your
hair and now you want

686
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:09,396
- See, they're too... - I think
they're fabulous, I love them!

687
00:58:09,722 --> 00:58:12,851
But wouldn't you want them bigger?
I like the bigger, the better!

688
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:15,640
Why, everything's gone bigger?
- See!

689
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,817
I'm definitely doing it. I called into
this one doctor,

690
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:25,393
and he's on vacation, and when he comes
back he has this stuff that isn't silicone

691
00:58:25,604 --> 00:58:28,666
It's some kind of juice from a plant,

692
00:58:28,786 --> 00:58:33,426
cause he said that silicone lumps up,
so that sounds pretty...

693
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:37,629
And I called up this other doctor and
he's all out of silicone!

694
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:42,638
So it shows that everybody's getting it!
Because then I'll get all our customers.

695
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,730
- Except for the... - Why don't you
develop your brain instead of your bust?

696
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:53,213
My brain can't be developed any more
than it is. And I think I'm cute!

697
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:59,500
I don't want to change. If I learn too
much, I won't always be happy!

698
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,181
Cause the more you learn, I think the
more depressed you are!

699
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:10,579
- You get silicone shots, so I'm goin
to, that's all - Joe doesn't ever...

700
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:11,997
Yeah!

701
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:19,508
They should really be much harder because
it doesn't, shouldn't hang like that.

702
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:21,557
- I know
They should be up, should be

703
00:59:21,677 --> 00:59:24,484
- That's why I'm getting the shots!
- Like that...

704
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,133
Joe, you never seem like you like them
like you used to.

705
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:33,227
- Are you turning gay or something?
-No I still like them, just not as much

706
00:59:33,347 --> 00:59:35,855
- Why?
- I'm used to them now, and...

707
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:39,097
I guess that's why I want you to have
the silicone treatments done.

708
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:41,855
- Well if you want it, you got it!
- Changed a little bit.

709
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:52,506
- and my topless dancing!
- that's beautiful, man!

710
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:55,899
I'd like to see that! Yeah, good...

711
00:59:56,777 --> 00:59:58,995
- Okay
- Good.

712
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,364
- You know you're sweet, you really are
- I try hard.

713
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,771
You got that tattoo, that says...

714
01:00:07,548 --> 01:00:10,835
That says little Joe...
On 42 street

715
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:14,783
- Oh yeah, I saw that - He was still in
it so I walked out, in the middle.

716
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,765
I couldn't believe it!

717
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:21,400
I understand I can't, you know, when you
don't listen to the sound, you don't

718
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,000
listen to the words, you can't
understand nothing...

719
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:27,596
It wasn't good sets to watch, I like
watching the sets.

720
01:00:27,716 --> 01:00:31,367
Not only that but there was nothing to,
I mean there was no,there was a story but

721
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:34,738
Joe would you please read this letter?
I can't see anything without my glasses

722
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:36,618
Alright.

723
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:42,058
Dear Audrey, I'm blind from several
things, number one my weekend in

724
01:00:42,178 --> 01:00:44,512
San Francisco, uhh....

725
01:00:45,694 --> 01:00:47,090
and...

726
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:51,399
was in Hawaii, so I figured, no..

727
01:00:54,123 --> 01:00:56,743
no scenes in LA, fully...

728
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:02,143
yes clearer night flight to Frisco,
arrived after two shows and four hours

729
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:03,982
sleep, be it...

730
01:01:04,196 --> 01:01:08,366
Got some 8 by 10s of my face, and
11 by 14s too,

731
01:01:08,617 --> 01:01:13,356
Not the one I wanted, there were 2 or 3,
203 alike, and when I'm...

732
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:16,528
When I meet, when I met it...

733
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:23,221
When I sent it.. to be... blown up to
11 by 14 I picked accidentally the one

734
01:01:23,341 --> 01:01:25,967
with my hands on my cock.

735
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:29,946
There are so...

736
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:35,035
There are so.. nearby, there
are... whatever.

737
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:38,668
nearby, think it the best of 72 shots

738
01:01:38,788 --> 01:01:42,220
You'll see them, on the first.

739
01:01:42,613 --> 01:01:45,449
It's now the 21st, 11 days...

740
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:49,803
For appointments, parties...

741
01:01:56,804 --> 01:01:59,325
I can't see!

742
01:02:06,684 --> 01:02:09,003
Gee, it's awfully quiet in here.

743
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:45,028
Don't think about it!

744
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,809
- I love him
- I don't either!

745
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:51,264
- You don't like em?
- No, I don't!

746
01:02:52,281 --> 01:02:54,679
They're my brains.

747
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:03,158
Listen Geri, can I feel your, umm,
hoojiggers?

748
01:03:03,439 --> 01:03:05,578
- Sure!
- Your Ittytuggers!

749
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,032
Yeah, haha, ittytuggers!

750
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:10,782
- That's another quaint expression
- Bring them up there!

751
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,879
- I never heard of that, cat!
- Oh, well I know this girl...

752
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,848
Oh, you don't need silicone!

753
01:03:16,968 --> 01:03:21,284
- I do, that's my little one, this is my
bigger one! -Oh i see they come in sizes

754
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:25,127
I thought these plants were real when I
bought them!

755
01:03:25,476 --> 01:03:28,411
- Are you sure you're right?
- I don't know...

756
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:32,385
- This one feels really wrong! - I know
lots of things feel real that aren't real

757
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:37,861
No, I could tell a fake plant from a
real plant, I think!

758
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:43,222
Listen, would you mind getting me some
water?

759
01:03:43,936 --> 01:03:45,951
I have to leave!

760
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:48,270
- Alone.
- Alone!

761
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,634
- Now what did you say this meant?
- I mean, it's awful pretty.

762
01:03:51,754 --> 01:03:54,685
- Yeah, but it..
- Do you get this, almost satin!

763
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,980
Joe I'm glad you could make it, let me
just put the blinds down!

764
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:15,023
Two doors down...

765
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,211
Some of these, physique, horseshit

766
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:21,158
Oh yeah? These dudes, do they pay
anything?

767
01:05:21,779 --> 01:05:24,793
- I got $100 for doing it...
- A hundred dollars!

768
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:29,161
Hey man I haven't seen you at the gym
lately. You haven't been around at all!

769
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:33,191
- Actually, I've been just, you know
- You not working out any more?

770
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:35,968
No, just, more or less working for
money man, I have to.

771
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:39,829
Keep making that money, I've no
time for relaxing.

772
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:44,104
Because, the gym really, you know,
like, is very important

773
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:47,677
you know, if you're going to stay in your
line of duty because you got to keep

774
01:05:47,797 --> 01:05:51,268
yourself together, I mean, you get to
a certain point in life, and

775
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:54,274
the body completely collapses, there's
no getting it back, I mean

776
01:05:54,394 --> 01:05:57,610
this gut that I got it's getting, it's
embarrassing.

777
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,084
You?

778
01:05:59,804 --> 01:06:04,724
Now, you know now I have all this flab
on the hips, and, lot of fat..

779
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:08,210
I just notice it, it's just all of a
sudden coming along that's why I want

780
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,631
to get back to the gym and, just
relaxing

781
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:13,906
cause remember when I met you at that
gym I was, real tight and swollen

782
01:06:14,026 --> 01:06:18,245
Yeah I know, you were so tight, that's
what, you know that was...

783
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:21,852
the most glamorous thing really, the fact
that you needed so much help, and

784
01:06:21,972 --> 01:06:23,968
and everybody was, like willing to
help you.

785
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,672
Yeah you were really popular at the gym,
I must say.

786
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:32,138
The problem you know, like, you remember,
I had this.. this..

787
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:38,653
- enormous scar, you saw that? That
scar? - Yeah, yeah

788
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:41,509
... off that muscle because that muscle
was all destroyed there.

789
01:06:41,629 --> 01:06:45,499
That was from Korea too. I got
burned by a flamethrower.

790
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:49,270
The flames were licking out and, right
up my arm...

791
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:52,425
and the hair all came back,everything
came back, it was nice.

792
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:58,078
feels good, except that I can't, I can't
really reach for anything, you know.

793
01:06:58,198 --> 01:07:00,213
I've been having a difficult time like
that.

794
01:07:00,537 --> 01:07:02,642
I can't get a hard-on any more.

795
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:06,931
I mean we can, we can talk about a lot
of things. I mean I'm not like all the

796
01:07:07,516 --> 01:07:10,033
johns that you usually deal with, right?

797
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:12,613
- Am I? - I don't actually put you
in that bag, man

798
01:07:12,733 --> 01:07:15,142
- I don't classify you as that, you
know, I just - I hope not.

799
01:07:16,209 --> 01:07:19,214
- Cause I like you a little more
- You're really beautiful

800
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:23,444
I thought you feel like, don't I
enlighten you a lot? I mean - I just...

801
01:07:23,793 --> 01:07:28,858
I mean, with all these art objects you
have, do you find that wherever you go?

802
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:31,463
No, I just find it here, you know,
I mean...

803
01:07:31,945 --> 01:07:35,559
It's just, the whole thing is always
very beautiful you know...

804
01:07:38,272 --> 01:07:42,437
But you know, I mean I don't ask you
for anything, you know.

805
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:45,643
Unless you know, I'm not asking you what
I ask you for,

806
01:07:45,763 --> 01:07:48,710
for anything at all, it's as a friend
you know, because,

807
01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:52,962
I need money today because, I have a
couple of things I have to...

808
01:07:56,339 --> 01:07:58,365
Money, cause...

809
01:07:58,485 --> 01:08:02,798
You know, a john or anything like that,
I think of you as a friend and...

810
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,993
- Well, it's.. - I mean the money I ask
for is just, you know, like a loan or

811
01:08:07,113 --> 01:08:09,076
anything like that, right?

812
01:08:09,196 --> 01:08:13,151
I mean I don't just want.. I just
want you to...

813
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:16,578
To like me, you know? I mean...
you're not all...

814
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:20,709
- pieces of shit? - Yeah right! How
could you say that?

815
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:23,082
They are! They really are, I don't
like them!

816
01:08:23,464 --> 01:08:25,468
They're terrible, they're disgusting,
they're...

817
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:28,966
I mean, I really can't take them, the...

818
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:31,992
asking for money you know is like a
punishment to them you know or a

819
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:35,369
- to myself or something
- Hold still. Let me get that.

820
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:41,108
That's a nice one!

821
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,162
- Just be good
- Because...

822
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:50,152
It was fun, it was always fun, it was
a lot of fun. I don't know.

823
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:54,396
Could you lend me some bread? In other
words, you know...

824
01:08:54,516 --> 01:08:57,510
nothing to do with, what, whatever we
may do, you know...

825
01:08:58,014 --> 01:09:00,412
How much do you need?

826
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,419
Well actually, you know, $30, because...

827
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:08,807
I mean I don't really desperately
need it, you know, it's just that...

828
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:13,350
right now I need some bread, you know,
I'm in a little financial difficulty.

829
01:09:14,162 --> 01:09:19,014
You're all, you son of a bitch, the last
time you were over here you took me for

830
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:20,654
fifty bucks!

831
01:09:20,936 --> 01:09:23,714
- I know but it's not because - And you
didn't even pay it back, you said you

832
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:26,652
were going to pay it back, I wish you
would just say to me, just say

833
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:29,426
- I'm not going to pay it back - I'm
not, no I'm not even going to say I'm

834
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:31,677
going to pay you, because I'm really, I
know what I'm going to do, I'm going to

835
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:33,490
- really pay this back
- Yeah!

836
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:36,540
No, I really mean it dude, I really do,
I'm going to pay this back,

837
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,303
and I'm gonna you know, I'm done

838
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:41,881
but if I say it, and I don't do it, or
something like that, or

839
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:45,450
or sometimes I don't do it if I make a
date, you know, next week I'll pay you

840
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,963
back, then you don't believe me.

841
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,822
Well it really doesn't matter, you know
that!

842
01:09:51,116 --> 01:09:52,680
It really doesn't!

843
01:09:57,172 --> 01:09:59,660
- Oh wow!
- Can you feel it?

844
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:02,508
Not too much, that's all dead!

845
01:10:02,753 --> 01:10:05,646
- Is it?
- Mmm hmm. It's all dead.

846
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:10,261
It's all grafted skin, and when they
grow back, it just didn't...

847
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:13,894
- It just didn't have any feeling in it
- Wow!

848
01:10:15,847 --> 01:10:18,571
You! Terrible!

849
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:24,785
But I have a feeling that...

850
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:26,729
No, I really think if you don't..

851
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:30,163
Why don't you come and live with me,
I mean you fuck around too much!

852
01:10:30,283 --> 01:10:33,477
You're not going to be able to do this
forever! - I'd love to do it, you know

853
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,021
I just, I don't know if I'm ready for
that kind of...

854
01:10:36,141 --> 01:10:39,504
But Geri wouldn't like that too much,
actually, she, it would upset her.

855
01:10:39,624 --> 01:10:41,012
You know that.

856
01:10:41,249 --> 01:10:44,739
- I mean who else does she have besides
me? - Well, she can afford it, man

857
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:48,000
I, I hate to say it to you but she's so
ugly, man.

858
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,207
She can afford to be upset.

859
01:10:50,327 --> 01:10:53,423
Really, you're crazy dude, I mean...

860
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,823
- We're not queers
- I know.

861
01:10:57,127 --> 01:11:00,414
But, lot of people, lot of people don't
understand that, you know.

862
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:03,355
They really can't see it as that...

863
01:11:05,068 --> 01:11:08,625
- Well, can you help me out?
- Sure, I'll help you out of your...

864
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:11,607
No, I don't mean my pants, I mean, you
know, with money!

865
01:11:12,007 --> 01:11:15,012
- Oh man, that's all you ever think
about is money!- No it's not,cause, it's

866
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:18,851
just, you know, I have to save it if I,
I may need it for later.

867
01:11:20,112 --> 01:11:23,504
- You mean you got another, you got
somebody in trouble? -I'll have to find

868
01:11:23,624 --> 01:11:26,738
-some, I'll have to stand out on corners
- You're not taking dope are you?

869
01:11:26,858 --> 01:11:28,397
- Let me see!
- No!

870
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,572
- You know, it's just that I need the
bread, not dope. - You are!

871
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:35,050
- You were shooting up for a while
- No I wasn't!

872
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,169
That's propaganda, you idiot!

873
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:39,805
- Well that's what they sell
- See don't believe what you hear!

874
01:11:39,925 --> 01:11:42,930
- That's what they sell in the Meat
Rack - What, in the Meat Rack?

875
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:44,786
That's not true!

876
01:11:45,182 --> 01:11:46,695
Okay, okay.

877
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:49,886
- I'll give you money
- Alright!

878
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:54,199
Wait a minute before we do anything I
want you to listen to this

879
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:57,811
It says 'After a few moments he pulled
me up from where I had been kneeling

880
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:00,042
and placed my cock in front of his mouth.

881
01:12:00,258 --> 01:12:04,456
He then licked..You know they always say
that a picture's worth a thousand words

882
01:12:04,957 --> 01:12:09,175
This book is so fantastic,I mean some of
the things that they have in here I mean

883
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:11,455
- What is it...?
- They do inches, huh?

884
01:12:11,575 --> 01:12:13,787
- What is it about?
- It's about, it's about

885
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,361
It's about images that, you know that

886
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:21,839
people get involved in, I mean things
that you do, but the way they...

887
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,721
Before I make a mistake.. everything
that

888
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:29,197
they put down here, it is so sexy I
can't believe it, it's fabulous, it's

889
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,538
all these things in here that, you
know, that...

890
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,516
You can't, well, look at that!

891
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:39,357
Wow! wow!

892
01:12:43,137 --> 01:12:46,953
- Does it get any groovy pictures in..?
- And, yeah, this one.

893
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:49,260
- An ass picture!
- You ought to try that!

894
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,613
- Right now. Yeah do it!
- Just do that?

895
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:54,814
- Take your clothes off and do it!
- No!

896
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:57,854
Could you get your legs back like
that and spread them?

897
01:12:58,383 --> 01:13:02,478
So that your buttocks are pressed
against the, that's like crushed velvet!

898
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:06,620
And just smash down, so that there's
this,

899
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,925
great fantastic line running up.

900
01:13:09,045 --> 01:13:12,107
Go on, try it Joe, I mean, you can
do it!

901
01:13:13,176 --> 01:13:16,238
I could do it, I could do it before I
got wounded,

902
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:20,164
I really could, and, I'd like to see
it, wouldn't you?

903
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:24,528
Like to do it?

904
01:13:25,091 --> 01:13:28,784
Well do it man! I mean I'd like to do it
I like to do anything!

905
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:33,972
Right about now. Go ahead, take your
clothes off man. Hurry up!

906
01:13:35,098 --> 01:13:38,025
I have about seven and a half...

907
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:43,164
steady head movement, and it didn't
take long...

908
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:47,948
for me to reach the point of no return.
As I did he took all of my

909
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:53,145
tingling, and I filled his hot mouth...
...before I fell asleep!

910
01:13:54,257 --> 01:13:59,347
I awake to find... throbbing at my... I
knew I couldn't handle it!

911
01:13:59,646 --> 01:14:03,451
So I tried... He began to run his tongue

912
01:14:04,776 --> 01:14:07,242
between my firm cheeks

913
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:12,324
He spread my cheeks and... and I begin
to wiggle.

914
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:15,828
And it was fast responding to his wild
caresses

915
01:14:15,948 --> 01:14:19,960
It didn't take long for him to moisten
it enough to suit his next...

916
01:14:20,268 --> 01:14:24,422
The pain was so bad that I thought I
must be ripped open completely

917
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:29,777
There he held me fast until my body got
accustomed to its visit. Drag his black

918
01:14:30,396 --> 01:14:34,528
nap, out, and then he threw, he threw my
legs over his shoulders...

919
01:14:34,648 --> 01:14:36,236
and he went again

920
01:14:36,843 --> 01:14:40,389
Slowly but surely he worked our two
bodies to the edge of the mattress

921
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:43,921
It was wonderful, I was now in such a
state

922
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:46,330
that I didn't notice we were being
watched, I had forgotten

923
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,401
about the phone and gas company

924
01:14:49,842 --> 01:14:51,471
He was twenty-four, twenty...

925
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:55,850
waited for the sub.. and he decided.. I
still didn't know where, and, he took...

926
01:14:56,537 --> 01:15:01,343
went open, only to find it was filled to
the very fat...

927
01:15:02,016 --> 01:15:06,085
I opened my eyes and start to behold two
well-developed

928
01:15:07,023 --> 01:15:11,064
There had been a lot of weights lifted,
the chest was free of hair,

929
01:15:11,184 --> 01:15:15,103
And I was completely spent and fell
asleep again, how do you like that story?

930
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:17,152
Okay?

931
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,002
- Do you think it was too dirty?
- No!

932
01:15:35,903 --> 01:15:38,987
I don't think I'll ever be the same!

933
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,397
Fuck!

934
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:49,887
- C'mere!
- I have to go, I have to go!

935
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:53,624
You big beautiful piece of shit get over
here I want to get a hold of you!

936
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:57,394
- I have to go man! - Where you gonna
go, not now!

937
01:15:57,514 --> 01:15:59,843
- Yes
- You tease me, c'mon now!

938
01:15:59,963 --> 01:16:02,027
You don't have to go, you stay all
night with me!

939
01:16:02,147 --> 01:16:04,447
- You can't treat me like this!
- David!

940
01:16:04,567 --> 01:16:07,577
Listen you keep slipping out all the
time, you're not, you haven't been

941
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:09,799
doing anything, are you still going with
that chick?

942
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:12,928
- I'm married to.. - You didn't marry
her, you can't lie to me!

943
01:16:13,048 --> 01:16:14,040
I did marry her!

944
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:17,023
- As gay as you are?
- As gay as I am, maybe, whatever.

945
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:20,298
- You're not really going to marry her,
are you? - I married her!

946
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:24,429
I'm sorry, it's just what I had to do.

947
01:16:24,549 --> 01:16:27,953
At the time, you know, one of those
things, but uh...

948
01:16:28,448 --> 01:16:30,468
- You know
- Well I'm gonna blow ya!

949
01:16:36,155 --> 01:16:37,900
It's pretty convenient!

950
01:16:38,441 --> 01:16:40,219
Oh no!

951
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:45,127
- Look at this. One!
- I want... Look!

952
01:16:46,003 --> 01:16:48,209
- Look at this. Hey!
- Two!

953
01:16:48,423 --> 01:16:50,123
- Hey!
- Three!

954
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,935
Oh my goodness, Patty!

955
01:16:54,428 --> 01:16:57,198
I mean, I fell down, then I fell down

956
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:03,569
How about the time when we hitched
with that maniac?

957
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:08,404
- We were sitting inside...
- Oh yes he had peyote!

958
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:11,015
He brought it and he brought
a pretzel too?

959
01:17:12,197 --> 01:17:14,561
And he says 'Would you like some
peyote?'

960
01:17:14,936 --> 01:17:18,098
- He said he has a pretzel, he said
'Look, honey'... - This is really...

961
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:22,173
Then he starts jerking off! And says,
well this is peyote!

962
01:17:22,293 --> 01:17:25,641
- Remember when he said I want to smell
your bloomers! No, he said... - Yes!

963
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:28,921
- What do you have under those mini-...
- A real psycho!

964
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:32,545
They really, they're all over.

965
01:17:33,488 --> 01:17:36,426
I run into them all the time, every time
I go into a train station

966
01:17:36,546 --> 01:17:38,407
somebody's jerking off!

967
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:43,981
I said, 'What are you doing?' I said I
know some games too...

968
01:17:44,101 --> 01:17:45,940
I got the blame!

969
01:17:46,334 --> 01:17:51,251
And the time Andrea went in his apartment
took this big piece of hash, this big...

970
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:56,508
And the guy said,'Well, you, both of you
are not leaving until I get my hash back!'

971
01:17:56,628 --> 01:17:59,105
And I said, 'Look I didn't take it!'

972
01:18:00,558 --> 01:18:03,096
How about the time when the guy
gave us $500?

973
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,298
.care of you,have somebody to look after
you, give you money when you need it

974
01:18:07,535 --> 01:18:11,416
- Like an allowance, someone gives me a
quarter a week!  - Are you kidding?

975
01:18:12,418 --> 01:18:14,793
It's worse to be married!

976
01:18:14,913 --> 01:18:17,581
-Is out of her mind!
- Oh, that's because of crying...

977
01:18:18,648 --> 01:18:21,045
She's really sick, yeah!

978
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:23,499
She's real psychotic!

979
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:27,704
- But, you know, we're all a little
touched! - Yeah!

980
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,403
Allo.. people!

981
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:12,253
- What did you do today?
- Nothing!

982
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:14,943
What did you do?

983
01:19:19,862 --> 01:19:22,361
- Who's this?
- I don't know!

984
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:25,029
- Tell her who I am
- What?

985
01:19:25,435 --> 01:19:29,170
- Tell her who I am!
- Why? I don't know you!

986
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:38,795
Well, this is my new girlfriend

987
01:19:39,268 --> 01:19:41,114
So you can go fuck off!

988
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,062
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

989
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:48,556
What's your name?

990
01:19:48,815 --> 01:19:51,651
- Patty
- Mmm? Mines is Joe

991
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:54,286
Joe?

992
01:19:54,882 --> 01:19:57,068
-This the one you talking about?
- Yeah

993
01:19:59,078 --> 01:20:01,712
And you have to show her your
body!

994
01:20:12,178 --> 01:20:14,246
Peek a peek peek!

995
01:20:25,729 --> 01:20:29,331
- One time he washed, his, uh, seat!
- Seat?

996
01:20:36,745 --> 01:20:39,638
- Take his panties off!
- Does that have a scab on it?

997
01:20:39,987 --> 01:20:43,620
- No it has a hole in it!
- I have one in my little...

998
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,299
There it is! There it is!

999
01:20:49,341 --> 01:20:51,840
- C'mon look!
- Looks better, now its sleeping...

1000
01:20:52,245 --> 01:20:55,015
Let's see it now! C'mon!

1001
01:20:55,544 --> 01:20:58,673
Do you like it? Patty?

1002
01:20:59,629 --> 01:21:03,344
- Can't complain!
-You are! What were you doing today?

1003
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:10,290
Don't you think you should take this
off?

1004
01:21:10,717 --> 01:21:12,889
-I wouldn't feel comfortable with it off
- Take if off!

1005
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:15,338
- Shoes...
- Take it all off!

1006
01:21:27,658 --> 01:21:31,451
- Everything has to come off!
- Don't break it off!

1007
01:21:32,273 --> 01:21:34,086
-... to go into your purse!
- It has to go off!

1008
01:21:34,206 --> 01:21:37,244
- Just here, blue...
- Man,you don't have to dress me up!

1009
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:39,120
You don't need...

1010
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:44,017
Now C'mon let's have some fun!

1011
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:46,862
- No, no fun, not when I'm tired!
- Yes!

1012
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,780
What did you do that you're so
tired?

1013
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,578
Yeah

1014
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,817
Oh but look at this, the cutest little
buns you ever seen!

1015
01:22:00,937 --> 01:22:03,530
Is this the one you wanted the night
before?

1016
01:22:05,015 --> 01:22:06,093
Yeah!

1017
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:11,249
No, you can tell, want to stroke
all...

1018
01:22:12,104 --> 01:22:13,860
See, look?

1019
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:16,399
I'm not going to have it
removed...

1020
01:22:16,519 --> 01:22:20,068
So it doesn't cost me anything? You
were too fast to jump in...

1021
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:33,824
Where'd you find him?

1022
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:36,602
Him? In the street!

1023
01:22:37,502 --> 01:22:39,056
But where?

1024
01:22:39,709 --> 01:22:42,129
I mean, how did, did you do...
I don't understand

1025
01:22:42,249 --> 01:22:44,121
why you got married?

1026
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:50,475
- I know but...
- We all make our little old mistakes

1027
01:22:51,821 --> 01:22:55,603
- With him every day,you know,you mgiht
as well have a little - little change

1028
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:01,344
- What? The bore...
- Same thing every day!

1029
01:23:02,279 --> 01:23:05,194
It is, besides, if

1030
01:23:05,836 --> 01:23:08,842
you're together every day it's tiring,
it's, you know

1031
01:23:09,472 --> 01:23:13,399
the magic isn't there any more, if it
was there in the beginning!

1032
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:17,484
Well I think the best kind of marriage
is when

1033
01:23:17,976 --> 01:23:20,464
the two people don't live together!

1034
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:24,134
- Don't live together? Well what's the
point of getting married? - Yeah

1035
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,450
Yeah, that's true.

1036
01:23:27,384 --> 01:23:30,308
Well I think it should be like that where
they just see each other every

1037
01:23:30,428 --> 01:23:33,719
- once in a while. Don't you?
- Well why not...

1038
01:23:33,839 --> 01:23:36,848
just not see each other when you don't
want to, instead of...

1039
01:23:37,461 --> 01:23:40,714
instead of that. You can always leave!

1040
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:47,368
- Get out of there!
- Just pack up your bags and go!

1041
01:23:50,835 --> 01:23:52,895
Well, Jeez, I gotta tuck him in!

1042
01:23:55,245 --> 01:23:59,680
- But seriously why's he so tired?
- Because he's so lazy!

1043
01:24:00,613 --> 01:24:04,328
There's nothing in, nothing in his body
works properly!

1044
01:24:04,448 --> 01:24:06,444
The blood doesn't flow...

1045
01:24:06,564 --> 01:24:09,281
- Nothing
- Girls have energy!

1046
01:24:09,686 --> 01:24:13,281
- Vitality
- Right. They think it is...?

1047
01:24:13,589 --> 01:24:15,402
The birth control pills!

1048
01:24:15,638 --> 01:24:20,926
- Give you so much energy! - It all
leads back to that, that's all it is!

1049
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:24,562
First of all gives you confidence!

1050
01:24:24,956 --> 01:24:27,171
Protects you...

1051
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:29,411
I don't know why you'd get married!

1052
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:33,047
- Hello?
- Mmm?

1053
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,038
- Why did you get married?
- To get out of school!

1054
01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:41,089
- I hated school so much, didn't you?
- And why?

1055
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:45,026
I learned more out of school than I
did in school!

1056
01:24:45,758 --> 01:24:48,516
I think they should have school up till
the 8th grade, just so

1057
01:24:48,636 --> 01:24:50,204
you can learn the basics!

1058
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:53,912
And then let you decide whether or not
you want to go to high school or college

1059
01:24:54,032 --> 01:24:55,950
- Exactly!
- You know?

1060
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,945
- And if it wasn't forced on you, you
wouldn't, you know - You would enjoy it!

1061
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,945
A

1062
01:25:01,065 --> 01:25:03,872
I was absent, and I was always...

1063
01:25:04,243 --> 01:25:07,079
Yes the same thing like me, I was
always...

1064
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:10,600
instigate, I'd make the whole class
get up in a uproar

1065
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,841
Teacher would say, 'Miss Smith!'

1066
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:16,087
I got expelled from Catholic school
in the first grade!

1067
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,563
Nun choked me...

1068
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:23,286
- Cause they'd rather do something else
- They're all frustrated old maids!

1069
01:25:25,445 --> 01:25:27,651
- Well I don't know..
- Why did....

1070
01:25:28,313 --> 01:25:31,757
- What? - I said why did they
have to be all that?

1071
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:34,020
Because they just are!

1072
01:25:34,774 --> 01:25:38,340
They're so miserable after all those
years, doing the same thing

1073
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,017
How miserable?

1074
01:25:40,794 --> 01:25:43,124
What makes you think they're
miserable?

1075
01:25:44,126 --> 01:25:46,073
Well, I don't know, they don't...

1076
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:49,178
I couldn't do it, that's all I know

1077
01:25:49,298 --> 01:25:52,577
I wouldn't be able to live that
kind of a life.

1078
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,963
I'm bored now! Imagine me in
a convent!

1079
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:00,903
I don't think he's so bad, Geri!

1080
01:26:09,491 --> 01:26:12,035
- Did you make any money today?
- No

1081
01:26:12,155 --> 01:26:14,674
No? Why not?

1082
01:26:16,914 --> 01:26:20,854
- Cause you don't need it!
- I need plenty of money!

1083
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:23,992
I say you just told me you didn't
need it!

1084
01:26:24,206 --> 01:26:26,694
- Everything you can get!
- OK

1085
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:28,503
- As much as possible
- Alright

1086
01:26:28,807 --> 01:26:30,608
- Okay?
- Okay.

1087
01:26:31,092 --> 01:26:33,456
- I'll get some tomorrow
- Okay

1088
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:35,750
- Okay? Right
- Right

1089
01:26:37,652 --> 01:26:39,903
- Well...
- Well why don't you get up and...?

1090
01:26:42,974 --> 01:26:45,326
What do you want, why are you
bothering me?

1091
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:48,152
You entertain!

1092
01:26:49,106 --> 01:26:50,817
You entertain me!

1093
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:53,890
- Oh I do enough entertaining!
- I want to see something!

1094
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:56,848
Because I said so

1095
01:26:57,141 --> 01:26:59,201
- Why?
- Cause I...

1096
01:26:59,437 --> 01:27:03,918
I'm tired now and I want to go to sleep
but I don't want to sleep over here

1097
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,776
- With something separating, I want to
sleep on this side! - I know!

1098
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:09,532
Climb over.
