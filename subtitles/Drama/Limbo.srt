00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,630
Welcome to America's last frontier...

3
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,550
...where the final lumbering
remnants of the Ice Age...

4
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,980
...the massive and
awe-inspiring glaciers...

5
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,060
...calve cathedral-sized
icebergs into the sea...

6
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,090
...where nature's bounty unfolds
in a panoply of flora and fauna...

7
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,140
...the like of which is seen
nowhere else on the planet.

8
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,460
From the ocean depths,
plumbed by ageless cetaceans...

9
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,820
...to azure skies,
where the mighty eagle soars.

10
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,740
This land abounds with creatures
great and small, strange and majestic.

10
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,660
It is a land steeped in tradition...

11
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,870
...its mists redolent of the hearty
souls of men who have gone to sea:

12
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,590
Tlingit and Haida...

13
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,420
...lnuit and Aleut...

14
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,020
...Russian and Norwegian.

15
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,490
Their languages and deeds...

16
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,630
...lingering on in the names of our
countless islands and passageways.

17
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,300
A land that has lifted its siren call
to the bold and adventurous...

18
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,940
...to those willing to risk their lives
for the promise of untold fortune...

19
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,460
...be it from fur, fin, from the heaven-
pointing spires of old-growth spruce...

20
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,670
...or from the buried treasures of gold
or black energy-rich petroleum.

21
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,420
A land visited each year
by the relentless and mysterious salmon.

22
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,060
Each river and stream welcoming home
the king and sockeye...

23
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,300
- the coho and dog, pink or humpback...

24
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,340
...which is smashed into cans...

25
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,380
...and quick-cooked to give the
colourful local folks something to do...

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,510
...other than play cards
and scratch their nuts all day.

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,940
A land where that nice old lady
from Fort Lauderdale...

28
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,380
...who had the stroke
three cabins down...

29
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,220
...was probably parked next to the
thawed-out halibut you'll eat tonight...

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,660
...while your floating hotel
chugs through the Hecate Strait...

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,700
...to deliver its precious
load of geriatrics...

32
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,260
...to the hungry
Visa-card-accepting denizens...

33
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,260
...of our northernmost and
most mosquito-infested state!

34
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,500
So?

35
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,060
What's "redolent"?

36
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,030
Having or emitting an odour.

37
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,980
You mean people wanna
come here because of the smell?

38
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,820
Pleasantly fragrant!

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,420
- Not talking about this place.
- Damn right!

40
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,980
Soon as they close this down, they'll
turn it into a tourist attraction!

41
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,420
They'll disinfect the joint, and you can
get a job in one of those cases.

42
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,940
Like in a museum.
One of those displays.

43
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,220
Dioramas!

44
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,700
Dioramas. In that diorama...

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,780
...they'll hang fake fish guts
all over you, put a label underneath:

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,620
"Typical Filipino Cannery Worker"!

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,740
Probably pay better than this.

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,820
I'll be out on the water in my boat...

49
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,660
...and every time I make a set...

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,260
...there'll be a floating
nursing home...

51
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,100
...with 500 sons of bitches and
their cameras capturing the moment.

52
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,630
And what boat is this?

53
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,150
My boat.

54
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,910
You don't have a boat, honey.
Remember?

55
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,020
Oh, yes, I do.

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,070
I'm getting it back today.

57
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,460
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?

58
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,300
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?

59
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,660
Thank you.

60
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,460
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?

61
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,260
Nice uniform.

62
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,020
The bride's parents wanted uniforms.
I look stupid.

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,020
You look like an angel.

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,460
I look like a little white maggot.

65
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,340
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.

66
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,300
How come you don't have to wear one?

67
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,780
This is the unemployed
pulp mill worker's uniform.

68
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,340
Right.

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,980
Would you like some hors d'oeuvres?

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,580
- No, thanks.
- I'll have one.

71
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,900
You gotta look at the big picture. You
clear-cut the trees, what do you have?

72
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,300
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of timber.

73
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,990
Yeah, but it's ugly.

74
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,700
The point is to try to get the trees
down without spending a fortune.

75
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,380
You're thinking short-term.

76
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,500
My mother told me,
"You don't shit in your front yard."

77
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,170
- Your mother said that?
- Constantly.

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,900
Look, our people cruise by an island.

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,740
They got their binoculars out,
the ones that can still see.

80
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,220
What do we show them?

81
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,620
We show them a little Indian fish camp,
some totem poles maybe.

82
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,500
A black bear foraging for breakfast
in the early morning mist.

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,860
We do not show them deforested hillsides
and logging equipment, Phil.

84
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,900
Heavy machinery they see in New Jersey.

85
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,870
The timber industry
has a right to make a living.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,780
We all have to make our living.
I'm not arguing that.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,820
Cut the trees in the Interior.
Turn it into a parking lot.

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,740
Just quit with the chain saws when
you get to where people can see.

89
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,390
We're trying to develop themes
for each area up here:

90
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,300
"The Whales' Causeway."

91
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,500
"Island of the Raven People."

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,420
"Kingdom of the Salmon."
"Lumberland."

93
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,420
That's us.

94
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,220
That's a turn-of-the-century sawmill
and a gift shop.

95
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,700
That's history, not industry. History
is our future here, not our past.

96
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,410
She looks like a million bucks,
doesn't she?

97
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,460
Beautiful.

98
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,940
Would you like some more?

99
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,060
No, thanks. Could you find the girl
with the shrimp and send her this way?

100
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,750
It's like these kayak outfitters.

101
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,380
I know the jellybean colours are
easy to spot if there's trouble...

102
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,940
...but it spoils the ambience.

103
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,220
C'est la vie, say the old folks

104
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,020
It goes to show you never can tell

105
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,540
Thank you. Thank you very much.

106
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,340
Thank you.

107
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,900
Today is a special day for me. I know
it's a special one for all of you too.

108
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,380
This is my last appearance
with Randy Mason and the Pipeline.

109
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,940
I'll be continuing my run as
a solo performer at the Golden Nugget.

110
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,940
Randy will be rapidly sinking...

111
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,620
...back into the relative obscurity
he so richly deserves.

112
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,100
The time we've spent together has seemed
much longer than it probably was.

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,180
And with that in mind, I'd like
to dedicate this next song to him.

114
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,390
Fellas.

115
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,660
Room 16

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,460
The Palms Motel

117
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,340
I can rest behind that door

118
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,980
My life with you's become a living hell

119
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,460
Don't wanna live like that no more

120
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,740
And whatever it will take

121
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,460
I will do to make this

122
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,100
Final break

123
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,780
Better off without you

124
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,660
Better off without you

125
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,460
Better off without you

126
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,500
In my life

127
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,260
I'll show up with a lawyer.

128
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,540
You threatening us with a lawyer?

129
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,940
In schools now, when they teach
contracts, you know who they use?

130
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,460
Francine here, that's who.

131
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,030
She wrote the fucking book!

132
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,140
It's not exactly a textbook, Louise.

133
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,340
I, on the other hand,
am a criminal attorney.

134
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,860
Some of the business practices
you engaged in...

135
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,860
That's bullshit!

136
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,020
You see two dykes wander up here
from Seattle, you figure:

137
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,940
"Here's easy pickings"!

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,020
When we bought these properties,
which you'd run into the ground...

139
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,020
That's not true!

140
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,780
When we bought them from you...

141
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,740
...promises were made about plumbing,
about dry rot.

142
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,580
I had a cash-flow situation.

143
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,940
Promises which you didn't keep!

144
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,260
I gave you my boat!

145
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,580
Yes, as collateral.

146
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,580
It's worth more than those repairs.

147
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,470
It's worth relatively little.
We've had it appraised.

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,820
I gave you my license.

149
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,900
But, Harmon, the problem is,
we are not fishermen.

150
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,300
Exactly.

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,510
So I take my boat, I go out,
I make my limit.

152
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,580
I give you the money.
I get my boat back.

153
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,940
Wait a minute. We paid
the docking fees all winter.

154
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,180
We had the engine overhauled.

155
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,980
And now that there's fish again...

156
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,780
...you think you can waltz in here...

157
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,820
...take our boat, Harmon, our boat,
as if you still owned it?

158
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,740
As if you never defaulted
on any of this?

159
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,860
You're worse than a fucking bank.

160
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,300
If we let you treat us like this,
what does that say to everybody?

161
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,300
- "Don't take these women seriously."
- You come here.

162
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,180
You bust people's balls...

163
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,310
Your balls are busted because you put
them in a vise and yanked the handle.

164
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,060
- The screw.
- What?

165
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,100
The jaws of a vise are moved
by a screw or a lever.

166
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,420
You don't call it a handle.

167
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,700
Thank you, Louise.

168
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,060
The point being, Mr. King...

169
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,380
...if you are feeling pressure on your
testicles, you have yourself to blame.

170
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,910
You're just gonna take the hit?

171
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,380
You're gonna let my boat
rot in the harbour?

172
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,740
You misrepresented the properties to us.

173
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,380
You tried to swindle us into keeping
your boat from being repossessed...

174
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,260
...by assigning the title to us.

175
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,110
You gals already said
you're not fishermen.

176
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,140
But there's no shortage of guys
who are willing to work for a piece.

177
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,570
A share.

178
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,620
What?

179
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,820
On a boat, you know, in nautical terms,
it's called working for a "share."

180
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,300
Thank you.

181
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,020
If we're gonna do this,
we have to get our terminology right.

182
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,060
You think you'll get anybody
in town to take my boat out...

183
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,820
...and fish on my license?

184
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,060
You're both fucking crazy.

185
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,780
Better off without you

186
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,790
In my life

187
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,820
Is this your truck?

188
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,390
You working here?

189
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,580
I gotta load this wine off.
Gotta help tear things down after.

190
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,300
Could you give me a ride?

191
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,100
Yeah, I guess. After I...

192
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,700
- How far is it?
- Just into town.

193
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,980
Whenever you're ready.

194
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,260
I'm ready now.

195
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,620
- Aren't you the singer?
- Well, I was.

196
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,500
You're really good.

197
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,500
Thanks. I just broke up with a guy,
and he's here.

198
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,900
And if I'm gonna keep my shit
together, I need to go now.

199
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,950
I'll wait here.

200
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,980
Yeah, I'll just...

201
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,930
I meant what I said before.

202
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,380
You're really good, singing.

203
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,740
Thanks.

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,260
Especially since I've never
heard of you or anything.

205
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,580
Do you watch sports?

206
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,430
Yeah, basketball.

207
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,380
There must be players who are
really good that you've never heard of.

208
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,500
Nope.

209
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,940
No, if they're professionals and they're
really good, everybody's heard of them.

210
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,860
Well, singing is different.

211
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,220
It's a matter of taste...

212
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,660
...luck, whatever.

213
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,140
You okay?

214
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,150
Couldn't be better.

215
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,780
Your boyfriend was
the guy in the band, Randy...

216
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,740
Mason.

217
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,940
Well, I never heard of him either.

218
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,660
Good.

219
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,100
Take a left here.

220
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,540
When we came up to this country
15 years ago...

221
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,300
...Margie was 8 years old and convinced
we would all be eaten by grizzlies.

222
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,740
So far none of us has lost anything...

223
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,340
...but the occasional
backpack to the bears.

224
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,630
And this has been for us,
like for so many people before...

225
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,510
...a land of opportunity, a land...

226
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,260
There's just a couple more things.

227
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,260
I thought this was your house.

228
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,500
See if he can survive
without the fucking microwave.

229
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,700
You taking his stuff?

230
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,140
My stuff. My daughter's stuff.

231
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,500
You sure?

232
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,500
Look around you. You see
everything that looks like shit?

233
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,700
That looks like somebody with no taste
and bad personal hygiene would have?

234
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,460
That's his stuff.
Would you grab the other end of that?

235
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,700
How long did you live here?

236
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,820
Three weeks.

237
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,660
I used to gig with him in Spokane.

238
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,340
He had this anorexic girl singer who'd
get too shaky to go on, so I'd fill in.

239
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,740
My booker talks me
into doing a year up here.

240
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,020
You know, "The money's real good."

241
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,940
I bump into Randy in Sitka,
and we hit it off.

242
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,940
So you move in.

243
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,260
No, I told him, " Keep your distance.

244
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,420
I got a kid. I'm older than you are.

245
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,740
I don't smoke as much dope as you do.

246
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,900
So don't think I'm moving in
or anything."

247
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,070
So how does your stuff
end up in his place?

248
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,780
Unforeseen circumstances.

249
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,100
You married?

250
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,540
Live with somebody?

251
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,500
Nope.

252
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,860
Sorry.

253
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,270
You work for those two?

254
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,060
Franny and Zooey?

255
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,700
Frankie and Lou? Yeah.

256
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,060
What'd you do before this?

257
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,620
Pulp mill, till it closed.

258
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,330
And before that?

259
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,860
This and that, like everybody.

260
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,180
Fisherman.

261
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,610
Yeah, I was.

262
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,620
Did you like it?

263
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,220
While it lasted.

264
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,460
You don't go out anymore?

265
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,740
Nope.

266
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,620
Why not?

267
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,420
Unforeseen circumstances.

268
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,500
I should get back.

269
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,660
Let's move it off the truck.
The guys inside will help me.

270
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,230
You're gonna stay here?

271
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,500
We were before.

272
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,420
This is my regular gig
for the next month or so.

273
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,060
Well, I'll come see you, then.

274
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,540
Sing.

275
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,820
Great.

276
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,300
My kid is gonna kill me.

277
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,020
It went fine.

278
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,260
The father was gonna
cater it on the ship...

279
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,460
...till the bride put her foot down.

280
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,940
You out of here?

281
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,260
Time off for good behaviour.

282
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,420
Saw all the groom's buddies
checking you out.

283
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,580
Right.

284
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm serious.

285
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,740
Bunch of preppy thugs.

286
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,220
You're a hard woman to please.

287
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,870
Catch you tomorrow.

288
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,220
You need a ride?

289
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,660
You know what they wanna bring?
Frankie and Lou?

290
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,620
- What?
- Alpacas.

291
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,500
For sweaters?

292
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,820
For hiking trips.

293
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,380
They wanna take people out
for a week or so...

294
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,460
...and have the alpacas carry the gear.

295
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,340
They do it on the Amazon.

296
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,140
The Andes.

297
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,420
The Amazon's a jungle river.
It'd be too hot.

298
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,820
It's probably the mountain range,
the Andes.

299
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,180
Whatever.

300
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,150
They get them up here, no way
I'm cleaning their cages.

301
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,700
These are some strange people
we work with.

302
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,260
I don't know...

303
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,260
We got the lesbo trail guides,
the human pincushion in the kitchen.

304
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,340
Rusty.

305
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,110
He looks like he took a staple gun
to his eyebrows.

306
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,900
We got Eunice, the cashier:

307
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,340
26 years old and still
lives with her mother.

308
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,340
We got the handyman there,
killed two people.

309
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,620
He what?

310
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,180
Joe Gastineau? Mr. Dark and Moody.

311
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,180
He killed people?

312
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,460
Got them killed. Same thing.

313
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,540
Took them out on his boat,
and they both drowned.

314
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,060
How'd you like to carry
that around with you?

315
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,860
I'm sorry you got stuck at work.
I just had to get out of there.

316
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm used to getting home on my own.
I just like to know where it is.

317
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,580
Half my clothes are missing.

318
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,300
Well, I grabbed everything I could see.

319
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,900
- I had a load in the dryer.
- We'll get it back.

320
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,180
I didn't wanna move over there
in the first place.

321
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,300
It was a dumb idea, and I'm sorry.

322
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,220
He wasn't that bad.

323
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,940
Compared to what?

324
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,980
- Compared to Lyle.
- He Whose Name...

325
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,140
...Must Not Be Spoken.

326
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,110
Now look, I made a mistake
with Randy, and I'm sorry.

327
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,140
I'll help you get your stuff.

328
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,220
You're the mistake.

329
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,260
Your ladies did a really nice job
with that reception.

330
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,460
I didn't eat, but it looked really good.

331
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,740
Is the boy that likes you the one with
the shrimp and the hair in his eyes?

332
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,020
I didn't say he likes me. I said
I thought he was good-looking.

333
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,100
And no, that's not him. That's Perry.

334
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,340
Perry wants to be a break dancer
when he grows up.

335
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,700
I thought that was over.

336
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,230
Disco hasn't made it up here yet.

337
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,220
Come on.

338
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,660
How could you think
I think Perry is cute?

339
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,510
You're a high school kid.
What do I know what you like?

340
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,860
Right.

341
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,380
You don't.

342
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,380
Are you mad at me about Randy?

343
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,580
Did you like him?

344
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,260
It's hard enough to keep
their names straight!

345
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,830
Don't be that way!

346
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,180
I feel like shit!
I could use a little support.

347
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,260
That's what therapy's for.

348
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,510
We're gonna have to rent the VCR again.

349
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,140
He's back.

350
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,500
There's nothing we can do about it.

351
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,300
He'll make a feud out
of this thing with his boat.

352
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,700
Our boat.

353
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,900
Doesn't he have a job?

354
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,700
If the temperature in the water
changes a couple of degrees...

355
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,140
...it becomes slightly
more or less acid.

356
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,430
Any little change, it can mean
the salmon won't return there.

357
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,030
And where do they go?

358
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,060
They probably just keep looking
along the coast until...

359
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,340
So the whole run disappears?

360
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,460
It's been known to happen.

361
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,500
Pretty hard-wired, fish.
Not many options.

362
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,460
People, though, got bigger brains.

363
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,820
They can guess at the future,
make decisions.

364
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,630
They just do a real lousy job of it.

365
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,300
I hate it when they're
stranded out in the air.

366
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,860
Their gills are working, they have
that desperate look on their face.

367
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,390
Well, they're drowning.

368
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,580
In air.

369
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,270
What do you think
it feels like to drown?

370
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,540
I don't know.

371
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,780
Never had the experience.

372
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,580
Blow it out!

373
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,540
Five more!

374
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,220
Four...

375
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,980
...three...

376
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,780
...two...

377
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,100
...one. Both hands!

378
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,100
Here we go!

379
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,900
Keep those knees going!

380
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,180
Eight...

381
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,500
Now reach and pull it down!

382
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,260
Strong arms!

383
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,380
Six!

384
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,930
Well...

385
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,140
...that's all she wrote.

386
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,340
They say the Chinese might buy it.

387
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,670
Pack it all up, ship it over.

388
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,860
They can have it.

389
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,540
Who wants a drink?

390
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,900
This is the Golden Nugget Saloon,
founded back in 1881...

391
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,310
...when Port Henry was the gold-mining
centre of the Northern Territory.

392
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,660
They say nobody eats
canned salmon anymore.

393
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,460
Do you eat it?

394
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,790
Why would I want canned
when I can get fresh?

395
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,020
People in Peoria are saying
the exact same thing.

396
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,940
The only recorded bout
between a domesticated wolf...

397
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,940
He's in that little DeHaviland of his...

398
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,260
...coming in with the wind steady
and the water's like glass...

399
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,820
...doing his usual rap about
the wilderness and the glaciers...

400
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,180
Think you're the only person up here
out of a job?

401
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,500
Trying to impress these two girls.
He's still got his wheels down.

402
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,530
I drop these people off the boat.
He's a bigtime corporate executive.

403
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,900
He's with his second wife and
two kids from the first marriage.

404
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,660
Those wheels dig in.

405
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,700
He flips tail over head.

406
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,180
They got heated tents,
freeze-dried gourmet dinners.

407
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,930
They're wearing about
$4000 worth of Gore-Tex.

408
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,420
The Beaver's lying belly up in the
channel. The two girls are unconscious.

409
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:06,020
He's hanging upside-down, hooked in by
his belt, water coming from all sides.

410
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,660
Two hours they lasted. And the exec
gets me on the radio, saying...

411
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,300
Head-on into some other bozo in a Piper
Cub whose eyes are also down on water.

412
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,140
It's so cold, your spit's frozen
solid before it even hits the ground.

413
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,660
And the metal has that tinny sound
when you slam the door...

414
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,500
...like the thing's gonna shatter.

415
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,460
There haven't been shootings.

416
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,660
Can't see the front of my plane,
this fog's so thick.

417
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,460
Harvest the resources, my ass.

418
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,490
A man goes out, he makes a set
and he catches fish, goddamn it!

419
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,540
He's not a goddamn farmer!

420
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,460
There's mountain peaks
all around me.

421
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,140
The Russians, the Japanese
scooping up our crab.

422
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,380
But it's been the setting
for many a confrontation.

423
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,860
Long time no see.

424
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,140
Smilin' Jack. What
brings you down this altitude?

425
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,190
Flew some medical supply
salesmen in from Cordova.

426
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,270
There's a thousand of them
at the Convention Centre.

427
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,420
Where are you living these days?

428
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,140
Two steps ahead of the finance company.

429
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,620
I'll see you later.

430
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,460
- Jumpin' Joe Gastineau.
- Friend of yours?

431
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,450
Not exactly.

432
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,620
You gassed her up

433
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,780
You're behind the wheel

434
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,910
With your arm around your sweet one
In your Oldsmobile

435
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,020
Barrelin' down the boulevard

436
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,740
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

437
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,910
Got paid on Friday

438
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,980
Your pockets are jinglin'

439
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,620
And then you see the lights
You get all a-tinglin'

440
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,940
'Cause you're cruisin' with a six

441
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,700
Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night

442
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,620
Mind if I sit?

443
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,050
No, please.

444
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,500
Thanks.

445
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,580
So...

446
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,660
You're terrific.

447
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,780
Who do I remind you of?

448
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,460
Remind me of?

449
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,900
Singers.

450
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,860
Most people go, "You remind me of Judy
Collins, but your voice is deeper...

451
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,530
...Emmylou Harris,
but your hair is curlier."

452
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,860
Screamin' Jay Hawkins.

453
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,140
Really?

454
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,500
No, I think he usually wore
a bone in his nose.

455
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,900
So can you make a living doing this?

456
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,790
Sort of.

457
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,540
You make a living working
for the lodge ladies?

458
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,740
Sort of.

459
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,180
It can be nice.

460
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:06,660
One summer, I did a cruise ship in the
Caribbean. I got to take my daughter.

461
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,100
You take her with you?

462
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,020
Pretty much, yeah.

463
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,700
Her father is...?

464
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,300
Out of the picture.

465
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,700
It was his choice.

466
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,550
So you've sung in a lot of places?

467
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,500
Thirty-six states and the territory
of Puerto Rico.

468
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,660
How about you?

469
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,300
I've been to Seattle a couple of times
and Canada, along the coast.

470
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,740
But you must like it?

471
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,300
I don't think I'd do so well
down south. You know, cities.

472
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,430
How come you're not married?

473
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,580
- Sorry.
- You know...

474
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,230
If you don't wanna say...

475
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,420
Probably the same reason
you're not married.

476
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,900
Because such a high percentage
of men are jerks?

477
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,980
Because women are scarce
and winters are long?

478
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,420
That's true, but...

479
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,420
You're looking for someone
who understands your bullshit...

480
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,900
...but is still crazy about you anyway?

481
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,340
That's a bit much to ask for.

482
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,660
No, it's not.

483
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,020
So have you, like, recorded songs?

484
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,340
I've made demos.

485
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,780
And I'm not exactly up here
to be discovered, or anything.

486
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,390
You know, at my age...

487
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,460
...it doesn't make a whole lot of sense,
my so-called career.

488
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,460
So why do you still do it?

489
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,140
Almost every night...

490
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,260
...it doesn't matter where I am
or what song I'm singing...

491
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,260
...all of a sudden, I'll hook into it.

492
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,150
I'll be feeling whatever it is
the song is about.

493
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,060
And I can hear it.
I can feel it in my voice.

494
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,660
And I know that I'm putting it across.

495
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,180
Moments of grace.

496
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,540
Do you know what I'm saying?

497
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,060
I do.

498
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,820
I put my kid through a lot, though.

499
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,020
Moving all the time.

500
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,340
But when I take a straight job,
bank teller, waitressing, whatever...

501
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,020
...I feel so defeated, I don't
even want her to look at me.

502
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,570
Would you like...

503
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,540
...to do something?

504
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,780
"Something"?

505
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,420
It's real pretty country here.
I could take you...

506
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,220
I gotta warn you.

507
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,220
What's the thing with
the long skinny boats?

508
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,220
Kayaking.

509
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,580
I don't do that one.

510
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:43,180
Or anything where if the spike comes out
of the cliff, you plunge to your death.

511
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,740
Climbing.

512
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,940
In general, things where you wear
gear instead of clothing, I don't do.

513
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,540
It's good to know.

514
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,420
What do you...?

515
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,220
When you're not working...?

516
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,980
I read a lot.

517
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,450
A lot, yeah.

518
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,100
I go to the gym, punish myself
on the treadmill.

519
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:10,220
If I'm with a guy, I make pathetic
attempts at ingratiating myself...

520
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,180
...often involving cooking
and cleaning activities.

521
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,590
When my daughter was little,
I would do stuff with her.

522
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,420
You don't anymore?

523
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,380
No.

524
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,500
So...

525
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,390
...if you're willing...

526
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,990
...let's work on this
"doing stuff" idea.

527
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,460
You think of stuff,
and I'll think of something.

528
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,100
But keep trying, really. Okay?

529
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,140
I will.

530
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,940
You know where to find me.

531
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,540
Two shows nightly. Bye.

532
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,780
It was called "Gold Fever."

533
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,980
In 1897, the first wave of fortune
seekers swept through Port Henry...

534
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,900
...on their way to Skagway, the Chilkoot
Pass and the Yukon gold fields.

535
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,300
They were desperate men...

536
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,860
...willing to perish in search of one
big strike every prospector dreamed of.

537
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,740
It could be the entire cruise,
or you may work just one leg...

538
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,020
...lay over at a stop and
switch to a different ship.

539
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,100
How much time would I spend at home?

540
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,180
We like to think of our vessels
as a kind of home.

541
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,740
Not much, huh?

542
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,220
We have this job for you.

543
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,300
It's different.

544
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,910
- We have this ship...
- Boat.

545
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,260
We have this boat.

546
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,380
The Raven.

547
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,500
We had the engine overhauled,
put a new gill net drum on it.

548
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,820
Harmon King's boat.

549
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,020
It's our boat now.

550
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,220
- He gave us his license.
- His entry permit.

551
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,150
Just to make up for some of the money
he still owes us.

552
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,980
We want you to go out.

553
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,380
To go out?

554
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,500
Go out and fish.

555
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,780
I'm not a fisherman.

556
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,300
Well, you used to be, right?

557
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,580
I mean, you know
what you're doing on a boat.

558
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,050
I suppose.

559
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,540
So you could, if you wanted to.

560
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,540
Yeah, if I wanted to.

561
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,990
We could figure out some kind
of percentage deal.

562
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,620
We don't know if we wanna keep it.

563
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,020
With the season almost over,
and the license so expensive...

564
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,580
You're not tight with Harmon, are you?

565
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,150
Not especially, no.

566
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,180
If you could just go down to the marina,
look it over.

567
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,150
Tell us if you need anything
to make it operational.

568
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,910
I haven't been commercial fishing
for 25 years.

569
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,300
Has it changed that much?

570
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, more technology, but I just...

571
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,780
You're bailing us out.

572
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,220
It's a matter of credibility.
If we let people walk all over us...

573
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,650
I'll have to think about it.

574
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,660
Think about it. Go down,
look at the ship... the boat...

575
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,550
...figure out who you'd like
to have for your crew.

576
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,070
You think people'd do that,
knowing that it's Harmon's boat?

577
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,460
You can always get somebody.

578
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:05,020
If there are any calls for me,
anybody comes by asking if I'm here...

579
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,140
...just say I'm not registered, okay?

580
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm trying to surprise somebody.
I don't want word to get around.

581
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,860
You get points for originality.

582
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,940
You're the first guy that's ever asked
me to watch fish thrash around and die.

583
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,790
- Well, it's...
- No, I'm not complaining.

584
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,430
I think it's cool.

585
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,940
I've seen it on TV,
but in person like this, it's...

586
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,700
They're so beat-up looking.

587
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,780
Well, they stop eating
when they head in.

588
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,340
My daughter did that for a while.

589
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,140
Almost had to put an IV in her.

590
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,700
Jesus, it's relentless, isn't it?

591
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,340
They don't stop.

592
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,620
Well, some of them do.

593
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,740
They just wear out and give up.

594
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,350
I'd make it.

595
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,980
Yeah, no sweat.

596
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,740
I do this much at the gym every day.

597
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,660
I'm gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

598
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,700
It's sort of a job, you know, a favour.

599
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,420
When I get back, it'd be
great to see you again.

600
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,020
That's all?

601
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,940
Your boat, Mr. Gastineau,
is a very unusual property.

602
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,500
Look, I don't wanna sell it.
I just want a mortgage.

603
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,580
But in view of your past
financial difficulties...

604
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,310
That was San Diego.

605
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,620
A poor credit rating
is a poor credit rating.

606
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,420
It's going to follow you
wherever you go.

607
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,260
It's just out there waiting.

608
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,900
Waiting for the chance to fuck you over.

609
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,540
- You personally?
- Whoever.

610
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,580
One second, you're skimming along
the surface, not a care in the world...

611
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,380
...then one thing goes wrong.

612
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,910
Yeah, like Rudy Bannister.

613
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,700
Rudy Bannister?

614
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,690
He's up in the fjord longlining when
the front of the glacier breaks off.

615
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,660
It makes this wave four or five stories
high by the time it hits his boat.

616
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,860
It's gone.

617
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,820
And Sonny McCarthy.

618
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,700
Gets caught in the riptides, trying
to short cut through Rimski Channel.

619
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,620
They hit the rocks.
Two guys stay onboard, two guys jump.

620
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,940
Sonny and the other guy
stayed onboard, bought it.

621
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,860
- Luck.
- Luck, nothing.

622
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,590
The ocean wanted them.

623
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,180
Hell, I'm glad I'm not
going out there no more.

624
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,420
It could be quick, like that
deadhead that Tommy Grogan hit.

625
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,620
It punched through his bow
and sunk him in five minutes.

626
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,420
Or it can sneak up on you
when you're not even looking.

627
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,660
Like Joe Gastineau.

628
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,270
Fuck. Ever a guy had the world
by the balls, it's Joey.

629
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,820
The basketball player?

630
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,780
He was headed for a full scholarship,
some university in California.

631
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,100
Senior year, he blows out his knee.
Kiss that goodbye.

632
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,300
Had a jump shot that'd make you weep.

633
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,740
So he gets on one of Torgeson's
crab boats up north...

634
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:28,020
...back when that was
a fucking gold mine.

635
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,460
Makes enough to put a down payment
on this little gillnetter...

636
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,500
...the Arctic Dawn.

637
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,340
Gets some friends, Lester Pope,
who used to work with his father...

638
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,700
...and this kid, Oley.

639
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,230
Jack Johannson's brother.

640
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:41,700
He'd never been out fishing.

641
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,660
He's like a high-school buddy.
Played hoop with Joe.

642
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,590
They were gonna go out with Joe
and make a big score.

643
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,140
I was crewing on the Cape Fox then.
We hooked into this run.

644
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,660
We were barely moving.
It was flat calm, no tide.

645
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,940
We were picking fish as fast
as we could to keep the net wet.

646
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,620
By nightfall, we were all plugged,
waiting in line at the tender.

647
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,220
About six boats ahead of us,
maybe eight behind, Joey's on the end.

648
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,380
It was party time.

649
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,550
Everybody that wasn't unloading drops
anchor, and they start boat-hopping.

650
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,020
So about 1, 2 in the morning,
Joe gets back on his outfit.

651
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,180
Him and the Johannson kid,
they go below to sleep it off.

652
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,140
And Lester racks out on deck.

653
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,780
It would be morning before
the tender could get to them anyway.

654
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,860
Maybe the boat was out of the water too
long. You get cracks, things dry up.

655
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,220
Or they were so plugged, the water line
rose up to where it'd never been before.

656
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,620
Whatever.

657
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,710
Without a sound, the boat fills like
a sponge and sinks in 30 seconds.

658
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,740
Damn.

659
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,180
So Joey wakes up, it's pitch-black.
He's underwater, right?

660
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,700
He's upside-down,
completely disoriented.

661
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:48,740
Swims out through the galley, yells loud
enough to wake me up on the Cape Fox.

662
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,860
We fished him out okay,
but the other two, not a trace.

663
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,580
Lost.

664
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,660
Yeah, he lost his friends...

665
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,380
...he lost the catch, there's no
insurance on the boat. That's gone.

666
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,900
And Joe...

667
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,140
Joe's not the same guy.

668
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,900
This old house is falling down...

669
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,980
...around my ears

670
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm drowning in a river...

671
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,860
...of my tears

672
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,230
When all my will is gone...

673
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,580
...you hold me sway

674
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,180
I need you at the dimming...

675
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,300
...of the day

676
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,980
You pull me like the moon...

677
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,300
...pulls on the tide

678
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,620
You knowjust where I keep...

679
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,940
...my better side

680
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:01,220
What days have come to keep us...

681
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,820
...far apart

682
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,420
A broken promise...

683
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,100
...or a broken heart

684
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,780
Now all the bonny birds...

685
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,220
...have wheeled away

686
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,660
I need you at the dimming...

687
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,820
...of the day

688
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,300
Come the night you're only...

689
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,460
...what I want

690
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,580
Come the night you could be...

691
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,100
...my confidant

692
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,420
I see you on the street...

693
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,980
...in company

694
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,990
Why don't you come...

695
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,820
...and ease your mind with me

696
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,780
I'm living for the night...

697
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,660
...we steal away

698
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,750
I need you at the dimming...

699
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,020
...of the day

700
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:52,380
I need you at the dimming...

701
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,820
...of the day

702
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,620
I already got you one.

703
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,420
How'd you guess?

704
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,300
I've been keeping my eye on you.

705
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,460
I like your singing.

706
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,660
Thanks.

707
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,980
You really class up this joint.

708
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,100
I've played worse.

709
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:29,340
Jack Johannson.

710
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,900
I've been warned.

711
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,020
A lot of formerly married women
took flying lessons from you.

712
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,180
A lot of formerly married
women are suing me for alimony.

713
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:42,900
I'm thinking of getting out
of the bush pilot game.

714
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,820
Find something more lucrative.

715
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,020
Let's see... Fast-food service?
Camp counsellor?

716
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,340
You live around here?

717
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,020
No. One-year tour of the frozen north.

718
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,420
Out on your own?

719
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,260
No, I'm hooked up with a guy.

720
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,540
Musician?

721
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,740
He's a fisherman.

722
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,860
Oh, my God!

723
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,390
He shot a fish.

724
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,620
Shot it?

725
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,140
A halibut. It was like
a gangland execution.

726
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,980
We could use some halibut.
When's Joe getting in?

727
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,630
Joe, are you home?

728
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,370
But he still works here?

729
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,820
On and off. He's out
on a fishing boat now.

730
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,140
Fishing? Joe?

731
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,140
Can I tell you about our specials?

732
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,990
What are you buying when you get
on a roller coaster?

733
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:39,100
Not risk, because only fringe consumers
want that, but the illusion of risk.

734
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,860
Being hurled to the edge of danger, but
knowing that you never have to cross it.

735
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,340
Mr. Disney's innovation was...

736
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,540
...to put these rides and attractions
into a story context.

737
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,420
You imagine yourself a character
in his cartoon...

738
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,140
...as you floated through
a plaster of Paris jungle.

739
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,700
The obvious next step, and
this is at the core of our proposal...

740
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,580
...is not bigger and better
facsimiles of nature...

741
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,940
...but nature itself.

742
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,300
Think of Alaska as one big theme park.

743
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,340
How'd we do?

744
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,740
Got a couple boatloads.

745
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:23,980
In three days?

746
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,340
They were running pretty good.

747
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,420
I kept a few out for the restaurant.

748
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:37,140
Oh, my God!

749
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,540
That's gorgeous!

750
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,940
That's great!

751
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,700
- Bobby!
- Jesus...

752
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:47,630
...look at this. You're all
where I left you six years ago.

753
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,820
Same barstools and everything.

754
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:51,940
Hey, Harm. Aud, you're looking good.

755
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,300
Somebody come in and
dust you off once a week?

756
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,060
How's the charter business?

757
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,220
I can't complain. I'm thinking
of bringing my Glacier Bay clients here.

758
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,900
"See Port Henry's wax museum.

759
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,220
Incredibly lifelike figures posed
in various stages of drunken stupor."

760
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,810
Set up a round
for these characters, Vic.

761
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,100
Just come up from Baja...

762
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:17,060
...chitchat the clients, lay
on the cerveza, harass the whales.

763
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,060
You like that?

764
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:21,100
I like not freezing my nuggets off
here all winter...

765
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,540
...waiting to see who
blows their brains out first.

766
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:25,900
You know Roscoe Karnes?

767
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,340
Roscoe with the voice box?

768
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,300
Blew his brains out February.

769
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:30,900
I rest my case.

770
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,420
Vic, I heard my brother's
been coming in here.

771
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,140
Fucking sellout!

772
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:37,620
He's over in the corner here, Bobby.

773
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,340
Jumpin' Joe, the man himself.

774
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,020
Hey, bro.

775
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,860
Heard they shut the pulp mill down.

776
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,370
Town smells better.

777
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:59,020
They said you were working for a couple
of button nibblers at Harm's old lodge.

778
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,340
How you been?

779
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,170
Terrific. Just terrific.

780
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,220
I just took a National
Geographic crew out...

781
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,190
...to do a piece on the sea lion
rookery before I come up.

782
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,740
I get a lot of repeat customers,
and computerized my navigation...

783
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,060
Teresa?

784
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,500
Teresa and the kids are cool.

785
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,060
Joaquin starts kindergarten this year.

786
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,580
Great.

787
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,070
Listen, someone said
that you were out fishing.

788
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,140
Frankie and Lou, they got
a boat, they got a license.

789
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,180
They asked me to go out, so...

790
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,460
Back in the saddle.

791
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,660
So to speak.

792
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,260
Sorry I couldn't make it
for the old man.

793
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,990
No problem.

794
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,700
I had clients.
Hollywood real-estate honchos.

795
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,900
Yeah, well, you couldn't make it.

796
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,980
I didn't have a ceremony.

797
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,420
I did some paperwork
and put up a headstone.

798
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,220
You got my check?

799
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,980
Yeah, thanks.

800
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,980
I called my mom to tell her about it.

801
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,940
How'd she take it?

802
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,620
Changed the subject.

803
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,020
Well, he was who he was.

804
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,780
Died in bed, man.

805
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:21,180
I always figured he'd freeze to death in
the parking lot outside of some joint.

806
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:24,460
You know the laundromat at Wrangell?
Where there's a shower?

807
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,380
The guys coming off the boats?

808
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,700
About three years ago, I was in there.

809
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,740
Got my soap, got my towel and back
in the steam, I see this old guy.

810
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:39,220
I say, "That is one
beat-to-hell human being."

811
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,100
The guy looks up and it's the old man.

812
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:45,220
That's the last time I saw him.

813
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:49,540
The Old Salt. The Old Prospector.

814
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,860
I tell my clients stories
about the old man.

815
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,340
Colourful shit.
The tour guide part of the job.

816
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,180
How he lost those fingers, and how he,
you know, survived the earthquake...

817
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,740
...and all those tidal waves
on that tender.

818
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,330
You heard them all.

819
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,900
The guy I was scared of
when I was little...

820
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,860
Nobody wants to hear about him.

821
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,020
Nope.

822
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,340
I gotta ask you a favour.

823
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,260
Me?

824
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,780
- Have I ever asked you for anything?
- What is it?

825
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,540
Well, I got a situation.

826
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,100
It's a finesse thing with a client.
I gotta pick him up at Skagway.

827
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,300
I need somebody to crew for me.

828
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,740
You always run your operation
on your own.

829
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,900
It's just for appearances.
It's a business deal, see?

830
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:42,070
I gotta impress the guy, so I gotta
look less like a captain and more...

831
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,660
Like an admiral.

832
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,540
Exactly. It's a milk run, and
since you're on the water again...

833
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,020
I've only gone out once.

834
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,020
Well, I can trust you.

835
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:56,220
I mean, this deal, this business deal,
it's sensitive. Word can't get out.

836
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,540
When would we go?

837
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:02,020
Day after tomorrow. I just gotta
put a couple things in motion.

838
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,220
I'll see if I can get off work.

839
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,140
You saved my ass, bro. I appreciate it.

840
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:12,780
You and me, we're...

841
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,020
Practically strangers.

842
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,340
No, we're the Gastineau brothers, man.

843
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,020
Half brothers.

844
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:20,780
Right.

845
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,140
Listen, I gotta run, bro.
I'm on a schedule here.

846
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:27,500
I'm at the south marina.

847
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,620
The Orca Princess.

848
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,300
Sunday morning, 7 sharp,
we catch the tide.

849
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,100
It'll be a blast.

850
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:42,500
Good evening. I'm Donna De Angelo,
and this is the Golden Nugget.

851
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:46,570
Well, I see some
familiar faces out there.

852
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,580
Welcome back.

853
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:00,700
There's the tide.

854
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,580
Is it with you? Are you plowing
into it? Is it slack?

855
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,300
Where's the moon in its cycle?

856
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,420
There's wind.

857
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,180
It can jump on you when you're
ducking in and out of the islands.

858
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,660
There's the size of the channel...

859
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,700
...the configuration of the bottom...

860
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,620
You still know all this stuff?

861
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,900
Yeah, as much as you can know it.

862
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,580
This isn't what I expected.

863
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:27,580
What did you expect?

864
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,270
I don't know.

865
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,970
Some guys, they live alone,
it can get...

866
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,140
I had the Health Department over this
morning. They sprayed the walls down.

867
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,060
You listen to a lot of different stuff.

868
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,900
That's good.

869
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,700
See a whole wall of the,
you know, Butthole Surfers, it...

870
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,020
You read books.

871
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,740
So you're either a nice, quiet guy
who lives alone, or you're...

872
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,330
...a serial killer.

873
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,180
I mean, my track record for consciously
choosing men is so horrendous that I...

874
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,930
If I...

875
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,140
...ever hooked up with somebody good,
it would be pure luck.

876
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,540
I'm being careful, okay?

877
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,230
Me too.

878
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,900
"'The Water Baby.'

879
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,780
The midwife knew at first look
it wasn't a normal delivery.

880
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,490
The newborn was cold
as it struggled and gasped..."

881
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,260
A little louder.

882
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:54,260
"The midwife knew at first look
it wasn't a normal delivery.

883
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,860
The newborn was cold as it
struggled and gasped in her arms...

884
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,740
...wet and cold with a bluish pallor
that didn't change...

885
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,140
...once she cleared its throat
with her finger.

886
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,900
It fought for air but
didn't open its mouth.

887
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,580
The mother, sweat-soaked
in her bed sheets...

888
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,300
...the father, video camera dropping
away from his apprehensive face...

889
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,460
...her assistant, on the phone
to the life-support unit...

890
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:20,540
...all seemed to move in a heavy
slow motion, as if underwater.

891
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:25,460
The midwife was halfway down the hall
with the baby before she noticed them.

892
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,500
A tiny, half-moon slit below each ear...

893
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,260
...lined with a deep crimson membrane.

894
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,950
Gills."

895
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,780
I never slept with a drummer.

896
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,420
Is that good?

897
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,220
Probably.

898
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:04,620
It probably indicates some level
of self-respect I've never fallen below.

899
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,740
So...

900
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:12,860
...ex-fishermen rate
higher than drummers.

901
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,260
Certain types of fungus
rate higher than drummers.

902
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:26,260
And what brings this up?

903
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:34,060
I don't know if my daughter's
a virgin or not.

904
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,740
Is she going out with a drummer?

905
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,860
No, I was just...

906
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:48,860
I don't know. Just thinking.

907
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,060
Well, have you asked her?

908
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,620
I don't wanna know that badly.

909
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:05,900
If I ask her if she needs underwear,
she considers it invasive.

910
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,980
She's been a major baby-sitter
since she was 13.

911
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,500
She wants her own money, her own room.

912
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,110
Independent.

913
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,260
You don't have any children, do you?

914
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,620
No.

915
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,060
But you were married.

916
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,570
I knew that.

917
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,460
It's a good thing you didn't
have kids to fight over.

918
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,620
So?

919
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,860
When's the last time you
were involved with someone?

920
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,340
About a year ago.

921
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:07,020
Someone from the pulp mill?

922
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,540
An aerobics instructor.

923
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:10,980
Not Corky.

924
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:12,940
You know her?

925
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,260
Yeah, she works at my gym.

926
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,420
So?

927
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,180
Who dumped who?

928
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,060
She thought I was too downbeat.

929
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,220
- She used that word?
- Among others.

930
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,180
Well, she's a real spark plug,
that Corky.

931
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:45,500
I have to tell you something.

932
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,580
I'm allergic to wool.

933
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:59,020
Like in a carpet, even a blend.
So in blankets and clothing...

934
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,860
I can get rid of whatever.

935
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:03,940
No, you don't have to.
If you see me itching...

936
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,860
Well, no, it's no big deal.

937
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,860
I bought new sheets.

938
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:14,940
In case you came over.

939
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:17,620
Really?

940
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,060
So maybe this is a terrible idea.
Veto it if you want.

941
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,060
Some guy?

942
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,180
He's really nice.

943
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:32,420
They're all nice
till you say they're scum...

944
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,980
...and shouldn't be allowed
walking the streets.

945
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,980
This'll be fun.
It's like a nature thing.

946
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,780
Oh, please.

947
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:44,380
You don't like him, you don't have to
deal with him again. It's my business.

948
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,030
Then why do I have to go?

949
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,860
Consider it a favour to me.

950
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,780
It's important he know
you're more than a rumour.

951
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:53,900
I'd rather stay a rumour.

952
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,340
Anyhow, you already know him.

953
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:59,100
You work with him. Joe Gastineau.

954
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,740
Is there some problem with him?

955
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,260
He seems really nice.

956
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,500
Is there something I should know about?

957
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,380
He's fine.

958
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,540
He's not the guy you like out there?

959
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,780
Honey.

960
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:29,460
Honey, he's my age. He's older.
What did you think could happen?

961
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,590
Nothing did happen, did it?

962
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,500
Give me a break!

963
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:44,350
Maybe this is good. Maybe it's a sign.

964
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:47,310
We don't usually like
the same type guys.

965
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,020
If I knew you were interested in him...

966
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,340
But I didn't, did I?

967
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:56,460
You can be mad at me,
but not that mad. Okay?

968
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:00,780
This isn't a willful
boyfriend-swiping type of thing.

969
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,260
It's something different.

970
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,580
If you do this for me,
I'll love you forever.

971
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,660
She's a good kid.

972
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,860
She's funny.

973
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,180
Really?

974
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:50,780
In a morbid kind of way.

975
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,420
So do you find her attractive?

976
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,810
I never thought about it much.

977
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,530
Well, she's a kid.

978
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,700
Will I sleep with you or with her?

979
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:08,900
It's up to you.

980
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,340
You two know each other.

981
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,470
I'm gonna go down below
and get things squared away.

982
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,020
Some coincidence, huh?

983
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:28,540
So you like boats?

984
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,740
I don't know. Never been on them much.

985
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:35,700
Well, we're gonna cruise up north a ways
and maybe see some whales, seals...

986
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:36,780
...sea lions.

987
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:41,300
My mother hates boats. Anything you
do outdoors that's fun, she hates it.

988
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,780
And she's allergic to wool.

989
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:45,780
She told me.

990
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,060
You allergic to anything?

991
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,460
My mother's boyfriends.

992
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,100
It's terrific down there.

993
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,100
Yeah, Bobby's got a real
nice operation going.

994
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,140
I love boats.

995
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,540
Hey, Joey. Terrific. You made it.

996
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,340
Bobby, this is Donna De Angelo
and her daughter, Noelle.

997
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,670
They're coming along for
the first leg of the trip.

998
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,020
Great. We'll take the scenic route.

999
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,190
Well, the first night, maybe
you slap some water on your face...

1000
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:51,620
Well, the first night, maybe
you slap some water on your face...

1001
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,550
...take your clothes off,
crawl under the sheets.

1002
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:57,820
Seems like minutes
before they yank you out of bed.

1003
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:02,450
You pick the money fish out of the web,
ice them down, make another set.

1004
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:04,980
The next night, you maybe
take your jacket off...

1005
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:07,860
...and sleep with your boots on,
on top of the rack.

1006
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,220
Third night, you might not
make it below.

1007
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:14,100
By the end of the week, you look
for someplace safe to lean on...

1008
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,540
...and close your eyes
for a few minutes.

1009
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,860
I've slept on fish.

1010
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,270
Sounds like hell.

1011
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,060
Well, people get hooked on it.

1012
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,020
God knows why.

1013
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,940
It's the thing itself, you know?

1014
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,460
You go out, you find the fish.

1015
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:34,860
You pull them out of the ocean.
You're right there with it.

1016
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,860
Everything else is secondhand.

1017
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,900
People work in canneries.

1018
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:44,740
People sell real estate, T-shirts.

1019
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,860
What if you couldn't sing anymore?

1020
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,820
What if you had to work, like,
you know, in a record store?

1021
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:53,550
So you liked it.

1022
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:57,900
And it was dangerous.

1023
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,180
And you got off on it.

1024
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:03,070
Yeah, I guess I did.

1025
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:08,190
Noelle is studying to be
a nuclear physicist.

1026
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:09,220
Very funny.

1027
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:11,860
You could. You're smart enough.

1028
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:15,700
She's been in a new school every year.
But she's a good writer.

1029
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,020
How would you know?

1030
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,820
I've read your stories.

1031
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:20,620
When I was 12.

1032
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,020
You still write, don't you?

1033
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,950
The weather service says
we got a gale coming.

1034
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:30,140
We're not gonna make it to the narrows.

1035
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:31,610
Is that bad?

1036
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:44,660
If we put in back here, the mountains
will knock down a lot of the wind.

1037
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:46,140
It's not a good anchorage.

1038
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,180
- You've been in there?
- No.

1039
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:51,070
Well, if we stay out here,
we're gonna get hammered.

1040
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,660
How's the kid?

1041
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,740
Do you want some water?
Rinse out your mouth?

1042
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,060
We could try another one of those pills.

1043
01:07:58,270 --> 01:07:59,670
No, I'll be all right.

1044
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,990
What are these cuts?

1045
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,860
- These...
- They're just cuts!

1046
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,060
"Just cuts"? How did they get there?

1047
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,790
Maybe I got them at work.

1048
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,140
People don't get cuts...

1049
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:12,810
We'll pull into
this inlet and drop anchor.

1050
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,860
When it calms down,
I'll throw on a couple of steaks.

1051
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,660
Are you all right?

1052
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,060
"Frosh Phenom Cans 30
in Overtime Upset."

1053
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,540
"Soph Sensation Leads the Saint
K-Cagers to the State Finals."

1054
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,060
He's got those scars on his knees.

1055
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,340
Jumpin' Joe Gastineau.

1056
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:36,860
The "Houdini of the Hardwood,"
the "Beethoven of the Bank Shot."

1057
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:38,460
So he was good?

1058
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,340
John Wooden sent one of his scouts
to look at him.

1059
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:43,020
Is that someone I should know?

1060
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:47,220
In basketball, it's like God sending the
angel Gabriel to check out your moves.

1061
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,620
Joey graduated, they retired his number,
retired his locker...

1062
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:52,500
...bronzed all his old jockstraps...

1063
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,190
...stuck them in the trophy case.

1064
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,940
High school.

1065
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:59,500
The game's changed.
Now I'd just be another guy.

1066
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,860
Right.

1067
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:03,340
This tofu burger, how does she like it?

1068
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,580
Mealy, medium-mealy
or black and crispy?

1069
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,460
I don't think she's very hungry.

1070
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,580
When this was a territory, it would've
been a hanging offense to eat bean curd.

1071
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,780
She is picky about food.

1072
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,060
If I scramble her an egg,
she makes me feel like a criminal.

1073
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,780
If your own kid can't make you
feel like shit, what's the point?

1074
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,100
No meat?

1075
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,900
No meat, no fish, no dairy.

1076
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,340
Food Nazi.

1077
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:29,860
I could scrape the green stuff off
the anchor chain, heat that up for her.

1078
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,740
Listen.

1079
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,580
You hear anything?

1080
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,660
No.

1081
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,630
Nobody comes back here.

1082
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,660
I thought I heard a motor.

1083
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,740
Listen, Joe, we got a problem.

1084
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,060
I should've asked.

1085
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,020
They're terrific.

1086
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,220
But this guy I'm meeting...

1087
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,980
Guys, actually.

1088
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:09,740
What's going on?

1089
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,060
It's complicated.

1090
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,860
Tell me.

1091
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,620
I was in a situation.

1092
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:19,860
I invested in some real estate.
It didn't turn out well.

1093
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,660
There was a cash-flow squeeze.

1094
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,940
I had these clients. They
owned an organic food business.

1095
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:30,030
I took them from Baja to Glacier Bay.
They're high the whole time, but nice.

1096
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:34,500
And at the end, we got along
pretty good, and they gave me a bonus.

1097
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,700
It's a pound of hash, right?

1098
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,870
It's primo stuff.

1099
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,300
They said if I wanted, if I was that
kind of guy, how easy it would be to...

1100
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,740
- Christ.
- They connected me with someone.

1101
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,300
I brought up a couple of loads
over the last few years.

1102
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:53,390
It's a piece of cake.
The money gets me out of a jam.

1103
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:57,140
It's just hash.
It's not crack or heroin.

1104
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,460
You carrying drugs onboard?

1105
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,420
No, Joe.

1106
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,140
I'm not.

1107
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,060
That's the problem.

1108
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,870
The last time I'm up,
off of Cape Caution...

1109
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,420
...a Canadian patrol boat
comes racing after me.

1110
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:13,300
I dump the whole batch.

1111
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,860
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

1112
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,630
I get nervous, and it's fish food.

1113
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,100
They had me confused
with some other boat.

1114
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:23,860
Somebody reported them running
too close to a pod of humpbacks.

1115
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:31,940
These guys, Joey, I don't know that much
about them, but they don't fuck around.

1116
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:36,540
They think I sold it on the side,
that I'm holding out.

1117
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:38,540
We arrange a meet in Baja.

1118
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,420
I get nervous again.
I smell a setup, I don't show.

1119
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,420
I come up here, my home turf.

1120
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:47,860
I contact them, arrange another meeting,
tell them we'll work it out.

1121
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,420
That's where we're headed?

1122
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,060
I got it all worked out.
A payment schedule.

1123
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,220
A mortgage on the boat, the house.

1124
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,460
They'd rather get
their money back, right?

1125
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,030
These are businessmen.

1126
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,820
What am I supposed to do?

1127
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:04,820
I told Teresa, Joey. She left me.

1128
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,900
She took the kids, went across
to Tijuana to her sister's.

1129
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,100
You gotta help me out of this.

1130
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:11,740
You don't tell me shit.

1131
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:14,020
I gotta have somebody backing me up!

1132
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:17,980
Just for them to see I got
somebody behind me, I got family!

1133
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,340
I mean, who else can I trust?

1134
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,300
But the women...

1135
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,980
We go by Tenakee Springs tomorrow.
We drop them off there.

1136
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:30,580
They were gonna fly back anyway.
Have a plane pick them up there.

1137
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:39,740
Stay up here. I'll figure out
something to tell them.

1138
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,940
You're saving my ass on this.

1139
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:44,430
You don't deserve it.

1140
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:52,300
I don't know. I just feel funny.

1141
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,700
Not as funny as I'll feel sleeping
in the same bed with you.

1142
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:59,540
Come on. You used to all the time.
It wasn't that long ago.

1143
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:03,950
It was that long ago.
It was in another lifetime.

1144
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,860
It could be kind of fun.

1145
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,340
If we weren't trying to impress
some guy, we wouldn't even be here.

1146
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,420
What do you mean, "we"?

1147
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,380
You know what I mean.

1148
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,620
There's no room, but come on in.

1149
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,300
How you feeling?

1150
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:21,540
A little better.

1151
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:25,740
Good. The wind's gone down,
so it should be pretty calm.

1152
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:30,870
Tomorrow, we're gonna swing over
to Tenakee and drop you off there.

1153
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,660
- What's that?
- A little town...

1154
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,500
No, that upstairs.

1155
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,510
Somebody come onboard?

1156
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,660
What's happening?

1157
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:49,780
All right, follow me.
Whatever happens, follow me.

1158
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,620
Swim for shore!

1159
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,060
They're up here,
getting off the front!

1160
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,980
Keep swimming.

1161
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:14,420
Keep going. Keep going!

1162
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:18,580
We've gotta get to the woods.

1163
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:19,980
Come on.

1164
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:32,540
Go up. Up.

1165
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:36,260
Up here.

1166
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,250
Come on.

1167
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,060
What the fuck is going on?!

1168
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:03,060
Somebody shot Bobby.

1169
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:03,990
What? Who shot him? Why?

1170
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:05,140
What? Who shot him? Why?

1171
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,420
I don't know. He told me
he was in trouble just now.

1172
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:09,700
What'll we do?

1173
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,020
Take your clothes off.

1174
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,100
What?

1175
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,940
Get them off or you'll freeze.

1176
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:16,220
- Hurry up!
- We have to get help!

1177
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,620
There's nobody here!

1178
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,300
Now help Noelle!

1179
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:20,860
I'm cold.

1180
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:23,100
If they come after us...

1181
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:26,020
...we're gonna have to move,
so put your shoes back on.

1182
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,580
I don't have any.

1183
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,740
I don't believe this is
fucking happening!

1184
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:33,100
The night's short now.
We'll be all right.

1185
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,740
Turn around. Get your shirt off.

1186
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:40,900
Scrunch down, scrunch down.

1187
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:48,660
Rub her, rub her!

1188
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:49,780
I can't breathe.

1189
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,350
I can't move.

1190
01:16:57,710 --> 01:16:58,860
It's okay.

1191
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,260
They're coming in.

1192
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:33,700
Here. Get on my back.

1193
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,900
Come on.

1194
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,500
Get the clothes.

1195
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:38,660
Hurry up!

1196
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:51,060
The boats are gone.

1197
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:54,260
Both of them.

1198
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:56,740
Think they'll come back?

1199
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,860
There's no way to know.

1200
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,580
Look, I'm sorry.

1201
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,380
I didn't have any idea till last night
that something was wrong.

1202
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,460
You think they killed him?

1203
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,580
Where are we?

1204
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:22,780
It's a little inlet...

1205
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,860
...on the back side of Kuleshov Island.

1206
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,140
What's that?
Like up Shit Creek without a paddle?

1207
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,540
Yeah, pretty much.

1208
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,340
Now, I think we should head
towards the channel...

1209
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:44,060
...while it's still light,
and hope we run into a stream.

1210
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:48,140
We'll be okay for a few days
without food, but water's...

1211
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:50,460
Here, try this.

1212
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,180
- What are you gonna use?
- Don't worry.

1213
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,860
I'll just be careful where I step.

1214
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:58,340
This is not happening to us.

1215
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,870
It could be worse.

1216
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,460
It's not that cold yet.

1217
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,100
And I've got my knife.

1218
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,060
Christ, wait a minute.

1219
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,020
We can have a fire.

1220
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:14,140
I'm not sure. Smoke...

1221
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:17,660
I'm not gonna let her
freeze like that. Not again.

1222
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:52,700
For white folks to leave the mainland,
they usually had some kind of scheme.

1223
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:59,100
People used to raise foxes
for the pelts, you know.

1224
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:02,260
It was a big deal for a while.
Watch yourself.

1225
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:04,820
Why come out here?

1226
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,670
Well, land was available, I guess.

1227
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:13,060
They would hunt and fish
and try to grow some things.

1228
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,380
Over here!

1229
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:32,780
Somebody lived here.

1230
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,470
Tomorrow, they'll miss us.

1231
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,460
Noelle won't be in class.

1232
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:45,940
Nobody will miss me in school.

1233
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:50,940
They'll miss you at your job. And Joe.
And I'm supposed to sing at the Nugget.

1234
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:56,330
It'll be a few days before people
start calling around for us.

1235
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:01,740
Bobby wasn't keeping radio contact,
so nobody knows he cut in over here.

1236
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:06,780
How long does it take to starve?

1237
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,780
I don't know.

1238
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:14,660
Depends on, you know, what shape
you're in, and what else you're doing.

1239
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,780
You remember that fast
that I did in Idaho?

1240
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,980
How long was that?

1241
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,140
You cheated.

1242
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,180
I did not.

1243
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:25,150
I had some tomato juice.

1244
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:26,820
Then it isn't a fast.

1245
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:28,860
Well, I'm starving now.

1246
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:34,780
How long will it take us
to get to the channel?

1247
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,570
A couple days. Maybe more.

1248
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:40,340
Days?

1249
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:48,180
I think we should hang here where
we've got shelter for a while...

1250
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,740
...make sure those guys don't come back.

1251
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:53,700
Then we can start a signal fire
on the shore.

1252
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,260
Do people come here to fish?

1253
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:02,660
Nobody does anything on Kuleshov.

1254
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,740
What about this stuff?

1255
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:16,060
No, I don't think so.

1256
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:19,060
That batch there, what you've got,
that's good.

1257
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,870
And you can look
under the rocks for crabs.

1258
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:27,220
When are we gonna light
the signal fire?

1259
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,740
I think we could risk it tomorrow.

1260
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:35,700
Then we find a place that doesn't
go under when the tide comes in.

1261
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:10,940
"'My Diary."'

1262
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:22,220
So are we gonna eat that thing too?

1263
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:24,340
Sea cucumber. Lots of protein.

1264
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:26,460
Can you hand me some of that algae?

1265
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,260
Sea lettuce.

1266
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:30,460
Thank you.

1267
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:41,020
These limpets taste like rubber.

1268
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:45,860
Frankie steams them in white wine and
ginger, on a bed of saffron couscous.

1269
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,700
It's one of the appetizers.
I memorized them.

1270
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:52,980
If we're here for a while,
I'll rig something for cooking.

1271
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:59,050
Sorry.

1272
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,540
Here.

1273
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:02,500
Chew this real slow.

1274
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,220
"My name is Anne Marie Hoak,
and this is my diary.

1275
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:12,900
Papa and Mother and I have come here
to make a go at the fox farming trade.

1276
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:17,860
If this pans out, says Papa, next year
I can go back to finish with school.

1277
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:22,030
I offered to get on at the cannery
to help out when we were in town...

1278
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:25,300
...but Papa says there's
too much trash working there.

1279
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,340
He was a logger, but...

1280
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:30,740
...fell while he was topping,
and now has headaches and dizziness...

1281
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:34,220
...that prevent him from many
of the trades other men pursue.

1282
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:37,180
This way, he says, we can live
in the great outdoors...

1283
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,780
...and operate our own business...

1284
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,940
...which is every man's true desire.

1285
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,380
Mother doesn't care for it.

1286
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:48,700
We have transported a dozen
breeding pairs of blue pelt foxes...

1287
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:50,540
...and put them in their pens.

1288
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,900
They're lovely to look at,
but nervous...

1289
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:56,060
...and I need to mind my fingers
when I'm near them.

1290
01:25:56,350 --> 01:26:01,020
When the vixens are ready to bear, we'll
separate them to be with their litter.

1291
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,860
Papa is building a fish trap
in the stream...

1292
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:07,500
...as he hopes to catch
the returning chum for fox food.

1293
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:11,500
I expect it will be a hard life,
but work is scarce back in town...

1294
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,470
...and Papa's spirit was getting low.

1295
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:17,900
Mother goes on about how
she'll miss female company...

1296
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:20,820
...and that I will have to
be her special friend.

1297
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:24,060
Papa thinks he's been
a disappointment to her.

1298
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:27,580
And sometimes she
doesn't do much to hide it.

1299
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:32,060
I'll be lonely here, I can tell,
but it should be a great adventure...

1300
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:34,500
...like Caddie in Caddie Woodlawn.

1301
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:37,780
I'll try to be a faithful writer,
dear diary...

1302
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,340
...and tell you my innermost thoughts."

1303
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,630
Read some more.

1304
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:48,900
Tomorrow night.

1305
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:51,500
We may not be here tomorrow.

1306
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:56,140
I found it.
I'll read it when I want to.

1307
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,900
We'll have something
to look forward to.

1308
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:04,180
Like a soap opera.

1309
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:06,260
Sounds like we're moving in.

1310
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:10,180
There's no telling
how long it's gonna be.

1311
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:14,100
We're gonna be all right, aren't we?

1312
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,540
We're gonna be fine.

1313
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:33,650
Lester!

1314
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:39,910
Lester! Oley!

1315
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,380
Help!

1316
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:44,930
Help, somebody, please!

1317
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:46,970
Somebody help me!

1318
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,140
Help me.

1319
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:56,220
Who the fuck is that?

1320
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,990
Lester and Oley. They're on the boat.

1321
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:00,380
What boat?

1322
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,060
Are you okay?

1323
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,370
What's the matter?

1324
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,620
You can't always save people.

1325
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:06,140
We need to feed this
a couple of times a day.

1326
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:10,500
When the sky's like this,
it won't be easy to spot.

1327
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,340
But on a clear day...

1328
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:15,340
So what if it rains?

1329
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:20,340
Well, if it rains or the tide comes in
too high, we'll start from scratch.

1330
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,500
Then we hope that somebody sees this.

1331
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:26,110
Somebody who doesn't wanna kill us.

1332
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,300
It's a possibility.

1333
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:35,550
Jeez, you two are a perfect match.
Doom and Gloom.

1334
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,340
- There's no use pretending.
- Yes, there is!

1335
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:41,140
We're on a camping trip.

1336
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:44,740
We're on a survival school camping trip.

1337
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,090
This is what they call "quality time,"
isn't it?

1338
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,020
This is what they mean.

1339
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:52,620
No distractions, no media stuff.

1340
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:56,900
We just get to know each other.
We gnaw the bark off a few trees.

1341
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,020
People pay money
to come on trips like this.

1342
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:03,980
If you assume that bad shit's
gonna happen, bad shit happens.

1343
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:06,100
I just don't see the point.

1344
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:16,620
The fish go in through here...

1345
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,550
...then they can't
turn around and get out.

1346
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:22,660
Well, that's the idea, anyway.

1347
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:26,100
This wire's kind of brittle, though.

1348
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,340
Where'd you learn all this stuff?

1349
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:30,340
My old man taught me.

1350
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,340
You did lots of stuff with him?

1351
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:38,940
When he had something to do and needed
somebody to swear at, he took me along.

1352
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,810
My father's a composer. My real father.

1353
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,140
Really?

1354
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:46,700
How long did you live with him?

1355
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:48,660
I didn't.

1356
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:52,340
She split up with him,
you know, before...

1357
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:59,540
Bobby was your half brother?

1358
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:03,550
Did you ever live together?

1359
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:04,700
Nope.

1360
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:09,140
We'd see each other around.

1361
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,230
He was a lot younger.

1362
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:15,530
Different friends, a different life.

1363
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:19,540
I've got two half sisters
and a half brother.

1364
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,860
What are they like?

1365
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:23,220
I never met them.

1366
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:27,530
They're pretty little still.
I saw them in a picture.

1367
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,650
He was in People magazine, my father.

1368
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:32,740
So you don't visit?

1369
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:36,300
She doesn't want me to.

1370
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,540
You just write letters and phone calls?

1371
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:42,970
No.

1372
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:54,380
You don't think we're gonna
get rescued, do you?

1373
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:03,060
"The house is small but cozy now that we
have cleaned it up and made it our own.

1374
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:07,380
I have my own room, and at night I hear
the owls calling back in the woods...

1375
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:10,900
...and our foxes yipping
when something wild comes by.

1376
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:12,980
There are blueberries everywhere.

1377
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:15,180
My fingers are stained purple with them.

1378
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:20,140
Mother insists I'll be attacked by bears
if I stray too far from the house.

1379
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,820
Papa's headaches are better,
and I help him clear the fish trap...

1380
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:27,300
...and prepare the food for the animals.

1381
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:30,900
It is unpleasant, sticky work,
but must be done.

1382
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:34,100
I've gotten stronger
handling the skiff.

1383
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:36,220
Mom chides Papa
for making a boy of me.

1384
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,830
But I don't mind.

1385
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,750
The days it doesn't rain
are God's glory.

1386
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:43,510
Most of our vixens are
close to giving birth.

1387
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:48,380
Some days, I'll go for hours without
speaking, and feel I'm changing...

1388
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:52,620
...perhaps possessed by the soul
of some long-dead Indian girl...

1389
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:55,340
...or perhaps the spirit of a she-wolf.

1390
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:59,370
This morning, I snuck up on Papa
felling a spruce for the fireplace...

1391
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:02,620
...and watched him for a long time
without him seeing me.

1392
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:05,940
Perhaps I shall learn
to become invisible.

1393
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:08,700
I made blueberry pancakes.

1394
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:13,580
Mother says if she eats any more fish,
she'll grow fins and swim back to town.

1395
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:17,020
At night, she has me kneel
with her to pray."

1396
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,540
You gonna read us some more?

1397
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,610
"The terrible birthing has begun.

1398
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,180
We think one of the vixens
ate her litter.

1399
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:45,580
The kits, the ones that survived...

1400
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,340
...are lovely once their eyes are open.

1401
01:33:49,630 --> 01:33:54,140
Papa told me not to handle them,
but when he is gone, I do.

1402
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,780
Their heads are squarish and fluffy."

1403
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,380
Fox babies.

1404
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,420
Isn't that enough?

1405
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:53,260
Don't want the bears to dig him out.

1406
01:34:54,790 --> 01:34:56,140
Sorry you had to see this.

1407
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:03,780
Killing somebody for money.

1408
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:08,060
By the middle of winter up here, people
kill each other because they're bored.

1409
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,300
Bobby took a risk, didn't work out
for him, and that's all.

1410
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:31,620
"Winter has locked us
in its icy embrace.

1411
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:36,940
The pelts of the animals are thick and
bluish, our home is blanketed with snow.

1412
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:42,740
Papa calls it 'Limbo, ' because it isn't
heaven and it's too cold to be hell.

1413
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:46,740
Mother wondered about purgatory,
but he said no.

1414
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,340
Purgatory has an end to it.

1415
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:51,780
'Don't torture me so, ' said Mother.

1416
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:56,300
The salmon we dried up has run out.

1417
01:35:56,510 --> 01:36:00,550
The kits are eating solid food now,
and it's hard to keep up with them.

1418
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:04,940
Papa went to the other side
of the island and shot two sea lions.

1419
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:08,740
He could only bring one back
without tipping over in the skiff.

1420
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:11,540
I had to help him
with the crosscut saw...

1421
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:15,140
...breaking it down to pieces
that we keep in the shed.

1422
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:20,420
Papa said it's just meat, but I tried
not to look at what I was doing.

1423
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:25,220
When Papa rowed back, the other
sea lion had been gotten to by a bear.

1424
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:28,820
We put a piece of the frozen meat
in each of the pens...

1425
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:31,700
...and the foxes fight over it
and gnaw at it...

1426
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:35,580
...and the outside melts from
the heat of their little tongues.

1427
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:38,140
Mother won't deal with them anymore.

1428
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:42,060
She has grown silent
with the shorter, darker days...

1429
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:46,980
...and only now and again will she
break out into one of her Bible songs.

1430
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:51,380
She asks me to join her,
but we don't harmonize well."

1431
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:55,260
"I have a dream about Fox.

1432
01:36:55,750 --> 01:37:00,660
He is a young man who comes to me on
snowshoes, dressed in the blue pelts.

1433
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:07,300
His skin and hair are dark,
but his eyes are ice blue.

1434
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,020
All the others here are paired,
he says:

1435
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,540
Papa and Mother.

1436
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,780
The sires and the vixens.

1437
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:17,220
But I am alone...

1438
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:20,100
...and he can't let that continue.

1439
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:25,140
Sometimes in the dream
he stays with us, but usually...

1440
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:29,660
...he picks me up and carries me
to his own island.

1441
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:33,180
Papa says...

1442
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:37,420
...if we can get the animals through
the winter, they're a gold mine.

1443
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:40,300
He says fortunes have been
started on less.

1444
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,630
He says if he keeps
having his dizziness...

1445
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:46,470
...l'll have to go hunting
with him the next time.

1446
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:51,700
The burns from where Mother hit him with
the bacon grease are only pink now...

1447
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:56,140
...healing, though the hair doesn't grow
on that part of his jaw.

1448
01:37:56,630 --> 01:37:58,500
I'm sewing a sampler."

1449
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:57,500
Don't worry about it burning.
Just flip it over after a minute.

1450
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:58,980
Did you put the trap back?

1451
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,020
Good.

1452
01:39:02,230 --> 01:39:03,660
Good day for planes.

1453
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:05,940
Nobody's coming.

1454
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,820
Don't be negative.

1455
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:11,780
In two weeks, how many planes
have we seen? Zero.

1456
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:13,660
We heard that one.

1457
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:17,220
There'd be more
if they were looking here.

1458
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,140
What's that supposed to mean?

1459
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:25,090
Bobby probably told
people at the dock...

1460
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,780
...that we were headed
in a different direction.

1461
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:30,260
He thought people were after him.

1462
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:31,620
People were after him.

1463
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,580
Stupid.

1464
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:41,300
Trying to impress your boyfriend,
drag us out on a boat...

1465
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:45,820
I'm cold, I'm hungry, I'm dirty and
I'm scared shitless, just like you are.

1466
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:49,180
- I'm trying to help us get through this.
- I shouldn't be here!

1467
01:39:49,390 --> 01:39:51,460
I shouldn't be in this state!

1468
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:54,060
Nobody is to blame for this!

1469
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,100
Yeah, right.

1470
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:59,420
When you are of age, you're free
to fuck up your own life...

1471
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:03,060
...but until that time, I'm afraid
it's my job to do it for you.

1472
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:04,900
You could help me with this.

1473
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:06,430
He's not my father!

1474
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:08,860
- Thank God!
- What's that mean?

1475
01:40:09,190 --> 01:40:13,070
He would've gone off picking berries.
That's the last we would've seen of him.

1476
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:14,140
That's not true!

1477
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:17,180
How do you know? You were
in the same room with him twice!

1478
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:18,340
You wouldn't let him!

1479
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:20,860
If he thinks of you once a year,
I'd be surprised.

1480
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:23,380
Every Christmas. He sent me a bike...

1481
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:25,540
He sent me a watch, a dollhouse...

1482
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,620
I sent the bike!

1483
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:34,300
I sent the watch! All of it.

1484
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:41,980
When you were little, I figured you have
the Easter Bunny, you have Santa Claus.

1485
01:40:42,190 --> 01:40:45,220
You should have a father in California
that sends you stuff.

1486
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:50,020
I hated that dollhouse.

1487
01:40:50,950 --> 01:40:52,780
I know you did, sweetheart.

1488
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:57,180
But you wouldn't let me exchange it
because it was from him.

1489
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:10,060
"I was the one who found them.

1490
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,940
It was time to clean
the scat from the pens...

1491
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,980
...so I had the buckets and the shovels.

1492
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:19,700
And then there was blood
everywhere in the snow.

1493
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:23,620
All of them torn and smashed,
even my little kits.

1494
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:25,710
A bear, says Papa.

1495
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:28,740
Though when has a bear gone
into a half a dozen pens...

1496
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:30,980
...without breaking the gates?

1497
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:33,940
Mother says nothing.

1498
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:38,860
But she's only a black spot these days
and refused to celebrate Christmas.

1499
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:42,500
I dreamed that Fox came and was angry
for what we let happen...

1500
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:47,420
...that he held me down on the snow,
and I felt his hot breath on my face...

1501
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:50,420
...felt it bitter in my throat...

1502
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:54,500
...and felt his ice eyes
cutting into me.

1503
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:55,970
I wish...

1504
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:00,980
...I wish he would come soon.

1505
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:04,900
Mother...

1506
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:09,620
...sleeps with me now,
and it is cramped and tense.

1507
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:11,540
You would think that...

1508
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:15,980
...another body under the covers
would bring warmth...

1509
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:21,940
...but I awake feeling drained, like
she's pulled all the heat from me.

1510
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:26,660
I'm doing the cooking now,
and my eyes...

1511
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:29,140
...are always red from the smoke.

1512
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,380
The wood is too big
for the cook stove...

1513
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:36,540
...but the ax has gone missing,
and we can't break it down.

1514
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:43,740
Mother says hell is a cold place.

1515
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:48,260
Maybe...

1516
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:53,340
...l'm the soul not of a she-wolf...

1517
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:59,380
...but of a soaring bird...

1518
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:05,550
...that flies south every winter.

1519
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:10,660
And my heart is so sick...

1520
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:14,060
...because I'm not supposed
to be here in this cold...

1521
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:16,340
...this dark, this wet.

1522
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:20,780
Maybe I'm like the air in this house...

1523
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:24,580
...the air that doesn't move
when Papa and Mother...

1524
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:26,470
...pass in silence.

1525
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:30,060
Dead smoky air...

1526
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:34,540
...that smells of wool and old bacon.

1527
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:42,750
We threw the animals on the rocks
for the tide to deal with.

1528
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:45,500
Papa cried."

1529
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:10,340
They're coming!

1530
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:13,140
They're coming!

1531
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:24,700
Careful!

1532
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:10,980
You folks picked a hell of a place
for a clambake.

1533
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:12,860
We've been stranded.

1534
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:13,900
Any more of you?

1535
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:15,100
No, it's just us.

1536
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:18,220
We were on Bobby's boat,
and he was murdered.

1537
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,140
I'm not sure who did it.

1538
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,740
We jumped off at night.

1539
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:27,140
A couple fellows came looking,
then we hid.

1540
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:29,140
Then they pulled anchor.

1541
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:30,980
Damn.

1542
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:33,300
How long you been here?

1543
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:34,940
A week and a half.

1544
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:38,860
We've been living in an old house,
holing up there at night.

1545
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:42,340
And I was hoping you people
could help me.

1546
01:45:43,190 --> 01:45:44,740
My radio's shot.

1547
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:48,260
I'm low on fuel and
heading into bad weather.

1548
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:50,540
Your radio's gone?

1549
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:53,940
Crapped out on me a half-hour ago.
Not even static.

1550
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:59,460
I'll have to turn this thing around,
try to get out of here, send help.

1551
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,500
Would you take my daughter?
She's sick.

1552
01:46:01,710 --> 01:46:03,940
I'd love to, but I can't
handle the weight.

1553
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:05,500
She barely weighs a thing.

1554
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:10,300
I've barely got a fighting chance
as it is. Sorry, ladies.

1555
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:12,500
Here.

1556
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:15,660
You wanna help me with this thing?

1557
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:21,500
I got a first-aid kit in here.

1558
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:22,860
No food, though.

1559
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:27,340
I'm real sorry to hear about Bobby, man.

1560
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:29,580
I used to party with him up in Haines.

1561
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:32,140
What's the story, Jack?

1562
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,570
What's what story?

1563
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:34,740
Who sent you?

1564
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:39,500
Just one more night out here, honey.

1565
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,660
And then they'll come back and get us.

1566
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:45,820
Couple of guys,
Mr. Smith and Mr. Brown.

1567
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:50,580
Never seen them before, but I don't
think they're here to save the whales.

1568
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:55,260
They laid some money on me to see if I
could spot three people in the boonies.

1569
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:57,100
And if you saw them?

1570
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:59,380
Just go back and tell them where.

1571
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:01,550
So why'd you land?

1572
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,740
I'm on the level about the radio, Joe.

1573
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:10,540
I hoped to find some fishermen with
a shortwave and a cooler full of brew.

1574
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:21,430
If I'd have known the deal about Bobby,
I'd have turned them in.

1575
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:23,380
You have to trust me on that one.

1576
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,910
Hang in there, ladies.

1577
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:29,020
I'll be back with the cavalry tomorrow.

1578
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:52,180
We're gonna make it.

1579
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:06,190
Last I heard, he was flying
out of Anchorage...

1580
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:09,060
...kicking square halibut
out of a cargo plane.

1581
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,060
What's that?

1582
01:48:11,150 --> 01:48:14,980
Marijuana bales. You fly over
a spot on the water.

1583
01:48:15,190 --> 01:48:18,220
Somebody signals you with
lights or a code over the radio.

1584
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:20,620
You dump them,
and people down below...

1585
01:48:20,830 --> 01:48:22,940
...fish them out,
take them to the next stage.

1586
01:48:23,150 --> 01:48:24,140
He's a drug dealer.

1587
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:27,860
He's whatever pays best,
or what he can get away with.

1588
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:30,460
He hit on me a couple of times
at the bar.

1589
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,150
He seemed like a nice guy.

1590
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:36,500
I'm not saying people don't like him.
I'm just saying I don't trust him.

1591
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,540
You think he might tell those men?

1592
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:42,250
I don't know.

1593
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,820
I don't believe him about the radio.

1594
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:49,620
And we've got some personal history.

1595
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:52,910
Like what?

1596
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:56,980
His brother drowned on a fishing boat,
and it was my fault.

1597
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:00,980
He wouldn't do that to us.

1598
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:03,140
He's not a killer.

1599
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:04,180
How do you know?

1600
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:08,850
I've looked in his eyes. I can tell
some things about a person.

1601
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:11,900
Look, we don't have any choice!

1602
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:17,020
You're sick. It's getting colder.
We can't stay here!

1603
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:21,380
Nobody's gonna show up for a while
if it keeps up like this.

1604
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:24,020
Not in a plane, not in a boat.

1605
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:50,220
It's got to stop sometime.

1606
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:52,110
Sooner or later.

1607
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,300
Humour me, okay?

1608
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:57,230
All right, it was worse yesterday
and the day before.

1609
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:02,140
The signal fire's probably out.

1610
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:04,340
As soon as it clears,
we'll get it going.

1611
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:44,500
It's blank.

1612
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:45,860
What is?

1613
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:47,450
It's blank.

1614
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:50,060
Look, after the first few entries...

1615
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:58,620
The foxes haven't even
had their babies yet.

1616
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:28,980
"We won't bury her on the island.

1617
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,580
She made me promise.

1618
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:35,380
She whispered it, and she hissed it...

1619
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:39,580
...in my ear one night when she laid
hard beside me in bed.

1620
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:41,820
'Promise me.'

1621
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:45,380
She wouldn't listen to anything else.

1622
01:51:48,710 --> 01:51:52,020
We had come back from
looking for deer, Papa and me.

1623
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,980
Signs at the salt lick,
but nothing to shoot at.

1624
01:51:56,790 --> 01:52:01,580
I was putting his rifle back
where he hid it in the shed roof...

1625
01:52:02,030 --> 01:52:03,980
...when I heard him cry out.

1626
01:52:05,150 --> 01:52:06,580
He wouldn't...

1627
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:10,140
He wouldn't let me in at first...

1628
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:14,580
...though I hollered
and struck at the door.

1629
01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:18,290
He opened up...

1630
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:21,910
...when he'd got her down
on the table...

1631
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:23,740
...but...

1632
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:28,420
...I still saw the black mark
around her neck...

1633
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:30,580
...where the cord was.

1634
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:34,060
The fire had gone out...

1635
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:38,980
...so our breath was showing,
Papa and me.

1636
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:42,580
White long sighs of grief.

1637
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:47,020
And her mouth open...

1638
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:50,580
...and hair crispy to the touch.

1639
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:56,660
We wrapped her in her afghan...

1640
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,270
...and then I...

1641
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:03,190
...I got the fire going
while Papa just sat.

1642
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,310
Nothing to say.

1643
01:53:07,710 --> 01:53:10,380
Later, we found the note...

1644
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:15,540
...and she told how the animals
were Satan's handmaidens...

1645
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:19,380
...and how their sharp little eyes...

1646
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:21,660
...would not give her peace.

1647
01:53:21,870 --> 01:53:23,580
So she killed them...

1648
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:26,990
...and then threw the ax in the woods.

1649
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:30,980
'We have looked into ourselves,'
she wrote...

1650
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:34,180
...'and what is there condemns us.'

1651
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:39,380
We'll take her off the island
come first thaw.

1652
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:43,580
If Fox comes...

1653
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:46,980
...padding through the trees...

1654
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:49,180
...he will find us gone."

1655
01:53:59,550 --> 01:54:00,420
That's it?

1656
01:54:01,230 --> 01:54:03,380
That's it. The last entry.

1657
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:05,290
Poor thing.

1658
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:06,660
Who?

1659
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:08,190
Little Anne Marie there.

1660
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:11,580
Her mother didn't love her
enough to stick around.

1661
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:13,740
She was crazy.

1662
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:15,750
But still...

1663
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:19,300
She left her daughter.

1664
01:54:21,270 --> 01:54:23,380
I would never do that.

1665
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:27,500
No matter what.

1666
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,740
I kind of look forward
to her being sick.

1667
01:54:43,830 --> 01:54:46,780
It's the only time
she lets me hold her anymore.

1668
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:50,190
It's some kind of fever.

1669
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:53,660
It's in her lungs.

1670
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:57,980
We have to get her out of here.

1671
01:55:03,710 --> 01:55:06,350
You really think he might bring
people back to kill us?

1672
01:55:07,870 --> 01:55:09,580
I hope I'm wrong.

1673
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,820
Lf...

1674
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:21,300
When we get back, I still
have some dates up north.

1675
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:23,950
I'd only be gone for...

1676
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,420
She could stay with me.

1677
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:30,580
And so could you.

1678
01:55:32,070 --> 01:55:33,260
You're not sick of us?

1679
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,180
You're not sick of me?

1680
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:39,100
There's nobody I'd rather be stranded
in desperate circumstances with.

1681
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:44,300
We should take our time
with the furniture moving part.

1682
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:48,380
You know, she pretends not to...

1683
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:51,980
...but she gets her hopes up for me.
When it doesn't work...

1684
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:53,860
I'll take care of her.

1685
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:29,380
There it is.

1686
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:33,740
Looks bigger.

1687
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:36,580
Room for all of us.

1688
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:38,380
Or those men.

1689
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:50,130
To hell with it.
I'm not staying here.

1690
01:56:52,670 --> 01:57:10,130
