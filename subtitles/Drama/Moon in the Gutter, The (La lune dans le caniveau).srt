86
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,760
The ancient book say ...

87
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,394
... that in the beginning ...

88
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,494
... there was no light in our world.

89
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,237
It took a super strong man ...

90
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:46,339
... to bring the Sun down to our little planet.

91
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,948
The guardian of the Sun ...

92
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:54,270
... regulates the seasons, looks after land and stuff like that.

93



94
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:56,815
As for the Moon ...

95
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:58,397
... it was brought over from the world of dreams ...

96
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:00,082
... by the first guardian of the Moon.

97
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,025
Actually,

98
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:06,660
He is someone who brought dreams into our world as well.

99
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,039
And that's ...

100
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:11,699
... how the balance was created ...

101
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,624
... between day and night.

102
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:46,174

103
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,045
Sohone!

104
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:56,416
Hye, girls.

105
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,538
How you doin'?

106
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,275
Aaaah!

107
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,897
Tomorrow is the Big Day.

108
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,004
Guess who is about to become the next "Guardian of the Sun".

109
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:09,514
Sohone!

110
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,066
Damn right.

111
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,979
Yaaaaaah!

112
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,004
Glim!

113
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,583
I know what you're upto and I forbid you to even think about it.

114


115
00:02:32,967 --> 00:02:34,702
You are not going to that ridiculous show.

116
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,398
If you say, Dad.

117
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,618
It's not your business and it was too dangerous.

118
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,392
I told you a million times,

119
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:40,527
But, no no no no no!

120
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,417
Why should you listen to an old candle, han.

121
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:43,999
Well, young lady

122
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,253
because this old candle knows better.

123
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,679
You know you can't go out in the sun.

124
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,023
Last time you snucked out your arms melted down your feet...

125

126
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:52,218
Yep!

127
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:54,955
I'm not good to spend my life resculpturing you.

128
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,687
Of course!

129
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,159
You want to end up like your mother.

130
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,669
She also wanted to see the world.

131
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:03,390
Oh, Ursula, my poor preciuos darling!

132
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:07,612
Why did you have to go out for big carrots in a terible heat flame at 3 in the afternoon.

133


134


135
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,086
I told you the fields wern't safe.

136
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,609
Aaaah! Nightfall!

137
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,726
Quick! Get to bed

138
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,167
and find somethingelse to dream about.

139
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,381
If I catch you trying to go tomorrow ...

140
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,626
... You are gonna be in big trouble ...

141
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,360
...Young lady.

142
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:23,435
Aaaah! You making me boil and the melting's giving me wrinkles

143


144
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,929
End of a conver ...

145
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,146
...sa...

146
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:26,683
...tion.

147
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:27,954
Haha!

148
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,613
Hm! Hm! Hm!

149
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,409
My, friends.

150
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,363
Ah!

151
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,737
As you all know

152
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:15,255
Ah!

153
00:04:15,315 --> 00:04:16,950
Tomorrow I shall be named ...

154
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,428
... the new "Guardians of the Moon".

155
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:19,942
Ah!

156
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:20,933
Oh!

157
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,081
It will be a historic moment ...

158
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,450
... For all, people

159
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,132
...of the night.

160
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:28,842
Aha! Ha! Ha!

161
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:38,918
Aha! Ha! Ha!

162
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:39,860
Miss me!

163
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,078
You can catch me, come on.

164
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,482
And I will be will ...

165
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,350
Aww!

166
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:01,238
Grrrrrrrrr!

167
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:05,004
Ah, Mune can't you be responsible for once.

168
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,105
You've embarrassed me in front of Leeyoon.

169
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,812
I forbid you to go to the ceremony tomorrow.

170
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:14,820
You can come out when you are ready to make yourself useful.

171
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:23,458
But I am useless.

172
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,289
Ya!

173
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,609
Today is the day.

174
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,054
Everyone to the arena.

175
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,836
Ahahaha Ooh!

176
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:33,883
Ah!

177
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:36,459
Hehehe!

178
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,464
Oh poor daddy, still frozen!

179
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:42,651
Grrr!

180
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:45,146
This day is goint to go down in historic, Dad.

181
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,364
I cann't miss it.

182
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,707
Don't worry, I'll stay in the shade.

183
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:49,637
I promise.

184
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,129
Love you.

185
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:52,481
Grrr!

186
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:54,347
I'll be back for lunch.

187
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:56,614
Grrr!

188
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:57,450
Grrr!

... Guardian of the Sun.

197
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,919
Master Xolal.

198
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,337
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you....

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,732

Thankyou my dear Krrrack!

00:07:54,772 --> 00:07:57,471
You have the sweetest heart of stone.

204
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:01,822
Uh! People of the day.

205
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,392
I've been incharge of the Sun's past ...

206
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,982
... for 350 years now.

207
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,199
it's time for me to step down.

208
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,961
I call upon my disciple

209
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,644
To come forward

210
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:20,896
Oh Ya!

211
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:30,954
Ya!

212
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:35,903
Sohone!

213
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,279
Ya!

214
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:37,323
Sohone!

215
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:37,916
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

216
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,737
sh! sh! sh! sh!

217
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:46,961
As long as the Sun shines brightly

218
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:50,045
the moon will glow humbly.

219
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:51,948


220
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:52,568
Huh!

221
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:57,621
I am Yule, the guardian of the Moon.

222
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:02,455
I call upon my disciple

223
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:05,429
To step forward

224
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,946
Oh, Sun!

225
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,555
I present to you, my disciple

226
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,682
He has a heart of fire.

227
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,541
And I believe him worthy of you

228
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:29,795
Huh! aghh!

229
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:31,721
I acknowledge him!

230
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:36,891
Huh!

231
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,643
Aaaaaaah .....!

232
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:48,556
We're all gonna die!

233
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:50,951
Help me.

234
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:01,811
The Sun recognizes its new guardian

235
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,404
I name

236
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,596
Umm

237
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:06,869
Sohone!

238
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:08,387
Oh yes, ah, Sohone!

239
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:18,018
Thank you! Thank you! Hello Darling!

240
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,137
Grrrrrrrrh!

241
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,838
Aaaaaaaah! Sohone!

242
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,286
Kukku!

243
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:35,723
Huh!

244
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:37,474
Oh, Moon

245
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:38,145


246
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:42,713
I present to you mm my disciple ...

247
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,758
... he has a heart ...

248
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,396
Oh goody!

249
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:47,729
And I believe him ...

250
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:49,181
of you.

251
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,883
But, only one creature on the planet

252
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,521
can be the judge of this.

253
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,815
The purest creature of all.

254
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,979
The moon ...

255
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,145
... recognises ...

256
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:25,948
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

257
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,972
What is this ?

258
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,477
Mune! Get out of there, right now!

259
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:36,153
Mune!

260
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,555
Who do you think you are.

261
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:39,963
I...

262
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:41,955
You are ruining my ceremony.

263
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,225
Go!

264
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,618
Go! shuh!

265
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:49,885
Get out of here!

266
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,375
Stay!

267
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:53,704
Stay still!

268
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:57,023
What's your name, little creature?

269
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:57,877
Mune!

270
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:58,998
Well then

271
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:00,468
Mune!

272
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:04,241
You are the new guardian of the Moon.

273
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:05,790
Aaauuuu!

274
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:07,273
What! Him?

275
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:10,723
But, You said this whole ritual was a formality.

276
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:11,561
Well,

277
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,935
The Moon felt otherwise.

278
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:22,517
Ah! Hah!

279
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:28,709
He! He!

280
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,406
There can be no day without night.

281
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:37,433
The same goes for the guardians.

282
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:42,177
The harmony of the planet now rests in your hands.

283
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,972
Prove yourselves worthy.

284
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,529
You double crossed Leeyoon

285
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:57,155
you little blue rat!

286
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:58,786
But I never wanted this.

287
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:02,382
The big one is as arrogant as you were.

288
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,562
The small one is as naive as you were.

289
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:09,426
It was an honor to serve as Guardian with you.

290
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,818
Come here, old chap!

291
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,532
Hahaha. Aaaaaaaah!

292
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,528
Oh!

293
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,666
Ha! Ha! Ha!

294
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:42,979
Necross!

295
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,697
Necross! Haha! Hahaha!

296
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,325
Xolal's reign is over.

297
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,513
The old lizard is on his way out out.

298
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:53,464
Spleen, get your butt over here, quick.

299
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,050
Come on. Chill out, Mox.

300
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:57,675
All this negative energy stressing me out.

301
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:58,557
What? You wanna fight.

302
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:00,180
Ooooh, I will mess you up!

303
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,509
SILENCE !!!

304
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,495
AH !!!!!!!!!!!!

305
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:11,656
I HAVE BEEN BURNING WITH DESIRE TO HEAR THAT DELIGHTFUL NEWS FOR CENTURIES!

306


307
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:16,319
NOW THE TIME HAS COME TO STEAL BACK THE SUN!

308
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:18,393
Ooh! Haha!

309
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,117
The boss is on fire.

310
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:23,627
We are gonna so chaos and misery everywhere!

311
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:24,957
Yepi.

312
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:29,168
MY PRECIOUS ONE'S !!!!
Ooohh!

313
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:31,191
What are those ?

314
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:34,000
THESE ARE EVIL CORRUPTORS.

315
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,108
THEY FIND DARKNESS IN EVEN THE PUREST OF SOULS.

316
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,736
oh Hahaha! Yehaha!

317
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,083
Oh! Here! Here! Make me evil!

318
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,353
Make me evil!

319
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,573
Please ....

320
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,599
Oh well.

321
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,210
Whatever!

322
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:50,122
SOON, THAT THE SUN WILL BE MINE

323
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:59,173
Years of training.

324
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,336
I was going to be the perfect guardian.

325
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:04,208
Moon was meant for me,

326
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:05,668
No one else.

327
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:11,517
Obviously, the moon was meant for you.

328
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,178
Right, me!

329
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:16,546
Precisely, no one else.

330
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,210
Certainly not that...

331
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,278
... ridiculous little blue rat.

332
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,454
That thing, a Guardian!

333
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:25,581
Exactly, give me a break!

334
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,119
Clearly the old guardian's ...

335
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,775
... made an absurd choice.

336
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,256
Necross agrees with you.

337
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,281
Necross?

338
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,612
Mune stole your place.

339
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,112
Really.

340
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,823
What does Necross think I should do about it?

341
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:43,137
Take back whats righfully yours.

342
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:44,577
Meaning?

343
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,057
The Sun for him

344
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,037
The Moon for you.

345
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:50,330
Come on, Leeyoon!

346
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:53,404
You know you deserve the Moon.

347
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,034
Ya!

348
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,802
I do.

349
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,783
Well, Mune.

350
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,179
This is your home now.

351
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,536
Woww!

352
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:34,158
I felt the same way, the first time.

353
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:35,965
Whats that for?

354
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:39,499
Well, to steer the temple, of course.

355
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,803
Wow!

356
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,703
Oh, and what's this?

357
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,869
You know where the moon comes from, don't you.

358
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:14,873
No.

359
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:17,635
It comes from the world of dream.

360
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:21,466
The first guardian carved the Moon...

361
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,584
...and brought it into our world through this trap door.

362
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:29,492
And now it's your turn to watch over it.

363
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,392
But I don't know what I am supposed to do?

364
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:35,583
The role of guardian of the Moon is extra complexity...

365
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,556
...And all this made this extremely careful.

366
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:42,876
You should never put dire consequences.

367
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:45,397
hhhh! Goodbye!

368
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,257
Look, I really think there's been a mistake

369
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,950
I'm scared of the dark, the stars, all look the same to me.

370
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,970
I get dawn and dusk mixed up.

371
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,575
I'm a terrible singer, so ...

372
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:03,849
Guardian of the Moon!

373
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,682
Master Yule?

374
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,195
Master Yule, are you okay?

375
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:20,958
Haaaaaaah!

376
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,214
Woww!

377
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,167
It's....

378
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:50,349
Woww!

379
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,282
I got no words, it is just ...

380
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,588
It's just .. Woww!

381
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,431
Am I right?

382
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:56,955
Oh! OH! Oh!

383
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,408
Oops, my bad.

384
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,536
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

385
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:02,706
And yes, it's just ...

386
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:03,971
Woww!

387
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,772
Man! This dude was cool.

388
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,528
Can you imagine!

389
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:12,064
That guy harpooned the Sun and brought it to our planet.

390
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,931
So, uh, let's get down to business.

391
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,329
Where are the harpoons, han?

392
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,022
We hardly ever used them.

393
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,188
Being guardian of the Sun has become more complex...

394
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:24,144
..since the discovery of astronomy, astrophysics, quantum physics.

395
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:26,471
But harpooning is what I trained for.

396
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:31,092
Well, there are other skills that you need to learn other than harpooning star.

397
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:35,825
Season calibration, photosynthesis, proper solstice management.

398
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:39,086
Oh! You  are paying tribute to Master Xolal.

399
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:43,995
Like all his predecessors, he has transformed into a majestic statue.

400
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,085
Iuh!

401
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,785
It is an honor serving you. Master Xolal.

402
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,475
And now it's time for fearles guardians...

403
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,292
...to embark upon their thrilling cosmic adventures and...

404
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:58,465
Uh!

405
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:00,424
Hello.

406
00:20:00,561 --> 00:20:02,513
Hey! Come back here!

407
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:06,551
No.

408
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,099
Glim!

409
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,514
Where are the kill cupboards?

410
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,790
Haaah!

411
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,569
Same place as usual, Dad!

412
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:26,630
I am Guardian ...

413
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,562
...of the Moooon!

414
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,536
I'm pretty sure this thing can go faster.

415
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:52,360
No!

416
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,809
No! No! No! No! No! No!

417
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,729
Oh! Oh! Oh!

418
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,171
Wrong note.

419
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,819
Aa ... .. this, this chord, huh?

420
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,479
Maybe...

421
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,830
No! No! No! No! No! No!

422
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:18,705
Haaaaaa !!

423
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:22,567
Give me that, this chord!

424
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:23,331
No!

425
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:24,633
or this one!

426
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:47,054
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Yeeha! Haha!

427
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,377
Hello, my fine feathered friend.

428
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:55,083
Would you like to rest on my broad and perfectly tend shoulder.

429
00:21:57,396 --> 00:21:58,536
Master Sohone!

430
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,289
This much heat could damage the crops.

431
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,945
It's time to raise the sun.

432
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:05,824
Ah, listen Krrrack! Times are changing.

433
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,289
People want the sun that shines you around.

434
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:09,714
Shines like me.

435
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,004
Huh!

436
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:12,756
Huh!

437
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:15,319
What the heck is he doing there?

438
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:21,988
Stop!

439
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,183
Stop!

440
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,501
Stop, You are wrecking everything.

441
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,803
Sorry!

442
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,200
What's Mune doing with the night?

443
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:49,277
Please, stop!

444
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,412
This is a nightmare.

445
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:06,858
ohh! Ohh!

446
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:08,408
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

447
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:12,754
Night time?

448
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:14,086
At this hour?

449
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:26,882
The Temple's gone offcourse.

450
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,894
Its Latitude is all wrong.

451
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,090
Don't worry, Everything is under control.

452
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,801
Where are you going?

453
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,965
Stay here!

454
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:12,150
Nooooooo!

455
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:31,584
Oh, man.

456
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,439
That little fuz ball is messing up my first day on the job.

457
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:39,579
uhm... uhm!

458
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:43,204
I have come to pay my respects to an old friend.

459
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,627
You have my "congratulations".

460
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:47,471
Oh, Leeyoon!

461
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,651
I'm about sorry what happened to you.

462
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,732
But, as you can see I have got a situation with the night here and ...

463
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,933
Yes, I can see that.

464
00:24:54,404 --> 00:24:57,295
Yule made a terrible mistake choosing that fraud.

465
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,315
Lucky for us, I have got day under control.

466
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,290
Mune's not only hurting the night, Sohone. He is threatning the harmony of our planet.

467
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:11,851
You will have to deal the consequences of his failures.

468
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:13,724
Oh that is so not cool!

469
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,904
You must set things right.

470
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:19,340
You and me ... ... As guardians.

471
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:28,421
Master Sohone, where are you going?

472
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:29,898
To get rid of that poser.

473
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,748
I am not gonnalet him jeopardize my career.

474
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,016
But you can't leave the temple

475
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,742
Its your duty as a guardian to

476
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,699
To do what?

477
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,243
Have you seen the size of this thing! Or you worried ?

478
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:42,441
Someone's gonna steal it by guard!

479
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:47,192
Hou! Hou!

480
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:54,974
Oh no!

481
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:57,322
The moon is drifting.

482
00:25:58,646 --> 00:25:59,471
Huhh!

483
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,590
I have an idea.

484
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:17,930
Oooouuuuf!

485
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,943
I don't think I have a back bone in my body.

486
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:25,885
Well, I don't have any bones in my body, really.

487
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,774
But, I just feel like I am a lousy daemon.

488
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,512
I'm bad and...

489
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:34,596
Hush! Shhh! shhh!

490
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:37,316
I think I'm doomed.

491
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:41,065
It's just ... I love nature, you know.

492
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:43,849
ummhhh!

493
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,065
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

494
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,629
Well, nature doesn't love you back. Get used to it.

495
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:00,644
Now, let's bust this thing.

496
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:01,993
Hum! Haha!

497
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,162
What's that fool doing?

498
00:28:12,338 --> 00:28:14,824
Stay here, let me handle this.

499
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:16,518
Come on, take it.

500
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,068
The Moon's fine. Just put it back in the sky.

501
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,578
And let's forget about the whole thing.

502
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,740
Come on! Maybe no one noticed.

503
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,121
It will be our little secret.

504
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,308
Ah..hem...!

505
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,141
With this wind velocity and this pressure gradient,

506
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,463
the moon should hit the lower troposphere and ...

507
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,182
What was that?

508
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:47,844
Arrrrgghhh! You come on !!

509
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:49,962
What are you doing over there?!

510
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:52,231
I'm carrying this entire thing.

511
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:57,413
Working pretty hard, back here. Getting sweaty.

512
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:06,408
The sun!

513
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,492
No!

514
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:11,361
Oh!

515
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,590
And, where do you think !! You are you going?

516
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,193
Two little devils are stealing the Sun.

517
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,499
Its none of your business, let the guardians handle this.

518
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:21,612
But I need to tell them

519
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:23,417
You need do as I say.

520
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:24,123
Ohoo!

521
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:25,477
Dad!

522
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,245
Give me back my hand.

523
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:30,008
Dad!

524
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,597
Oohh, sweetheart. You're just too fragile.

525
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:37,529
All I want is to protect you from danger.

526
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,730
You have to trust me, Daddy.

527
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,411
Glim, get back here.

528
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:48,346
Oooh!

529
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:52,116
Oh! You are made of the same wax as your mother.

530
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:53,990
Just like all your night friends.

531
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:56,687
Creeping and crawling And when you come into the light

532
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:57,621
Its a disaster.

533
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:58,573
Its not my fault.

534
00:29:58,598 --> 00:29:59,945
Its a responsibility.

535
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:02,045
Its an honor to be a guardian.

536
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:03,807
Its an honor I never wanted.

537
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:04,340
Sohone!

538
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:05,280
A girl?

539
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,014
Sohone!

540
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:07,765
Ladies first.

541
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,652
I'll will finish with you later.

542
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,328
Oooh, a fan.

543
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,971
You came here to see your hero in action, ay doll?

544
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:24,476
Hohoho!

545
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,711
Wow!

546
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,275
The sun!

547
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,679
Somebody stole the Sun!

548
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:30,510
Huh?!

549
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,086
WHAT?!

550
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:35,011
I'll be right back.

551
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,323
No! No! No! No! No! No! This can't be happening!

552
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:00,076
It can't be!

553
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,228
The Sun!

554
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:03,061
Ah!

555
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,861
This is my fault.

556
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:12,968
Night ?

557
00:31:12,993 --> 00:31:14,951
At this time of day?

558
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:15,976
Thats weird!

559
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,214
It probably just an eclipse!

560
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:21,850
WELL! WELL!

561
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,858
YOU ARE MINE ONCE AGAIN!

562
00:31:25,895 --> 00:31:28,543
FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

563
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:31,488
I SPREAD YOUR LIGHT TO RUN THE PLANET.

564
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:33,536
I SPREAD LIFE.

565
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:35,801
STILL THEY TOOK YOU BACK.

566
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,395
THE TOOK YOUR LIGHT AWAY FROM ME.

567
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,178
AND THEN PLUNGED ME INTO DARKNESS.

568
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:43,171
FINE...

569
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:44,642
...THEN..

570
00:31:49,395 --> 00:31:52,055
... BRING ON DARKNESS!

571
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,895
Oh Ya!

572
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,274
Have you seen how slap happy the boss is?

573
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,148
nothing like a little chaos and destruction to make him smile.

574
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:06,077
PUT THE SUN SOMEWHERE SAFE!

575
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:09,004
WHERE I CAN WATCH ITS HEART GROW COLD.

576
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,228
AND DIE

577
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:12,217
You are an idiot.

578
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:13,907
Um But its not my fault, I ...

579
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,352
No!

580
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:16,269
That wasen't you riding the Temple of the Moon like

581
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:17,500
A Wild Goroon!

582
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,920
The Temple of the Moon!

583
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:21,200
Every guardian has their own style.

584
00:32:21,225 --> 00:32:23,380
Mine, well its a work in progress.

585
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:25,851
A work in progress?

586
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:27,212
Oh boy!

587
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,606
You have obviously never studied the ancient books

588
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,063
Or any celestial laws.

589
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,786
And you claim to be a guardian?

590
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,130
Ahh! Seriously.

591
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,588
You're right.

592
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,641
I'm just a regular kid from the forest.

593
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:43,003
All I'm good at is calming down babies who have nightmares.

594
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,012
But Yule put me incharge

595
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:45,979
Right?

596
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,910
It must be for a good reason?

597
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,311
So I made one

598
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,593
small mistake, but

599
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,487
YOU!

600
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,640
I am gonna...

601
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:53,801
hanh ?! Hey!

602
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:56,378
Get back here so I can hit you.

603
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:59,253
I'm a laughing staff because of you.

604
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,657
Wooohh! You're gonna pay for this.

605
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,933
First the Moon, now the Sun!

606
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,085
I am the one who has to clean up your mess!

607
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,543
But...

608
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,402
Your're gonna have the shortest career of any guardian ever!

609
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,145
Hey! Hands off!

610
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:17,673
Necross was the thief.

611
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,298
How could only be him.

612
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:23,113
He must've been plotting his revenge.

613
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:28,095
Tonight Mune gave him the opportunity to take it.

614
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,984
Okay, let's set a few things straight.

615
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,958
Here! You're the real guardian.

616
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:34,602
Mune, you are just not up to it.

617
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:36,797
Ah!

618
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:40,872
Hurry, Sohone.

619
00:33:40,897 --> 00:33:42,577
Without the Sun's light,

620
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:45,281
The moon will wane and could soon go out.

621
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,265
Don't worry, I'm on it.

622
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,938
I've to get that Sun back.

623
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:53,077
Wait, I'm coming with you.

624
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:58,102
You are warm.

625
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,420
And if you get too far away I'll freeze.

626
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:01,974
Listen sweetheart, ...

627
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,492
You're not gonna leave me here?

628
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,109
Alone...

629
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,622
... In the dark ...

630
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:08,083
...in the forest.

631
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:09,782
Unprotected!

632
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,184
Oh no!

633
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:49,389
What have I done?

634
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:52,598
You destroyed what was most sacred to us.

635
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,446
My friends! Ah

636
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:58,502
I'm sorry, I never meant to cause any harm.

637
00:34:58,527 --> 00:34:59,546
But you did.

638
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:02,397
You are not the Moon.

639
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,073
I was trying to get it back.

640
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,382
I almost did, but ...

641
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:09,191
Don't you realize the consequences of what you've done?

642
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,598
You don't belong here anymore.

643
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,065
No!

644
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,010
No! Don't leave.

645
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,862
I can still fix it, I ...

646
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,876
Dad.

647
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:28,094
I'm sorry.

648
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,365
I promise I'll find a way to make this right!

649
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:47,908
Glim!

650
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,963
Gliiimmm!

651
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:52,638
Where is that girl?

652
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,673
Gliiimmm!

653
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:57,422
Seriously?

654
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,363
Gliiiiiii!

655
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:05,299
See, harpoons are way more complex than they look.

656
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:06,710
If You want good results,

657
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:09,382
You gotta handle them with care and attention.

658
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,470
Just like the ladies.

659
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:13,327
You're right.

660
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:14,484
Ah!

661
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:16,624
Can I get a hand here?

662
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:17,553
I'm stuck!

663
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:19,031
Stuck with Me?

664
00:36:20,154 --> 00:36:20,907
Wowww!

665
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:21,893
Lucky girl!

666
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,989
Wow! Check me out.

667
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:28,619
Can't find bisceps like these on night guys, han! Haha!

668
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,770
By the way

669
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:31,817
Are you from night or day?

670
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:32,858
I am mixed!

671
00:36:32,883 --> 00:36:34,337
I am from dawn and dusk.

672
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:35,624
Do you have any problem with that?

673
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:37,365
You are not prejudice, are you?

674
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,384
What? Nnno, of course not?

675
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,876
I mean is just that night guys ...

676
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,650
... they're, different.

677
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:44,380
They scare kids.

678
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,642
Wait a minute.

679
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,470
The fourth star of the Zebra constellation indicates North.

680
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:50,048
Which means we're heading East!

681
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,254
Oh! We're going round in circles!

682
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,279
Aaaa! Noooo!

683
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:55,453
No, I know exactly where we're going.

684
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:56,478
Oaaaaaaah!

685
00:36:57,651 --> 00:36:59,145
I know my stars, Sohone.

686
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,648
I'll take the lead from here.

687
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:16,903
Wow!

688
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:18,406
Really?

689
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:21,436
No need to swoon over three blinking insects!

690
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,711
I'm coming to look for the sun with you.

691
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:28,529
No, can't do, bug boy.

692
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,756
I'm on my way down to the undeworld. Agh

693
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,546
Like you could ever handled that.

694
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,357
I wanna fix the damage I did.

695
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,151
That's cute.

696
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,874
And what do you gonna do to Necross, han!

697
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:39,119
Sing him a lullaby!

698
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,933
You won't make it through the forest alone.

699
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:46,218
You need me.

700
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:48,891
Finding the sun is serious business, small fry!

701
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,717
You guys keep arguying that about who is man enough

702
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:51,922
I'm going.

703
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,084
Allright, you can guide me out of the forest.

704
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,780
But after that you're out of the picture.

705
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,570
You are not strong enough for what's waiting for us.

706
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:02,640
Hurry!

707
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:03,799
I'm freezing here!

708
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:12,867


709
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,673
I am ...

710
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,891
Guardian of the Moooonnn!

711
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:20,075
Chu chu chu chu Moon Moon!

712
00:38:20,116 --> 00:38:21,721
Chu chu chu chu Moon Moon!

713
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,339
Oooooh! Didn't see you there!

714
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,428
Now...

715
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:28,693
Rise and go forth into the night!

716
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,161
Huh?!

717
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,498
What?

718
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:39,333
But, but...

719
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,890
Why won't you stay up?

720
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,489
Sohone!

721
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:50,251
Aren't you afraid of the lightning monster?

722
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:51,240
The who?

723
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:52,386
Well ...

724
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:55,383
You know, the ancient book say that in order to get to the underworld,

725
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,454
You have to dive into a giant blue hole

726
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,775
And face the terrifying, bloodsucking,

727
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,981
Bone crushing lightning monster guarding the entrance.

728
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:05,739
No one even knows what it looks like.

729
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:07,974
Because no one has ever survived the journey.

730
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:08,812
Ever!

731
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:09,610
Haah!

732
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,951
I don't read books, but

733
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,630
I can throw a harpoon.

734
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,441
You're safe as long as you stay with me.

735
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:15,890
What about Necross?

736
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:18,318
The ancient books say he became a gigantic lava monster who ...

737
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:19,763
I told you I don't read it!

738
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,809
Leeyoon?

739
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,796
Whats happening with the Moon?

740
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:39,433
My powers, they're gone!

741
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,471
Errrr, never fear, good people of the night

742
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,959
I'm incharge now.

743
00:39:56,674 --> 00:39:58,807
We better hurry!

744
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:02,782
Don't panic!

745
00:40:02,807 --> 00:40:04,074
Not to worry.

746
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,352
The giant blue hole!

747
00:40:17,377 --> 00:40:20,380
Its exactly how the books described it.

748
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,679
Amazing.

749
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:22,290
Right!

750
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:25,788
And how do we get down there? Disguise ourselves as sardines?

751
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,341
This algae is filled with oxygen.

752
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,942
It will provide enough air under water for ...

753
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:34,868
Ya, ya, I get it!

754
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:35,679
Ok !

755
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,115
Not too, bitter for you?

756
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,081
Nope.

757
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,120
Delicious.

758
00:40:40,145 --> 00:40:41,059
What?

759
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:41,979
Strange! I mean

760
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,621
Helium algaeis known for being quite bitter. Hmhmhm

761
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:46,709
You've did ...

762
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,585
Come here you little, umh.

763
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,882
This over here is oxygen algae.

764
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:54,528
You see.

765
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,492
Ah Glim.

766
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:58,523
Here's one for you.

767
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:00,032
I won't need any.

768
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:00,891
But...

769
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,298
You should, this stuff is extra pretty good.

770
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:05,136
The water is too cold for me.

771
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:07,388
I might freeze and break.

772
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:09,385
Why, you thought adventure was all riding unicorns

773
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,094
And dancing with elves?

774
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,415
Bad news honey!

775
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,704
We are not living in a fairy tale!

776
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:15,844
Its gonna be okay.

777
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:18,070
I'll take you with me.

778
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:19,666
Hot! Hanh.

779
00:41:26,093 --> 00:41:27,874
Don't let me sink, okay!

780
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:29,186
You'll be safe.

781
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,736
Just, let yourself go.

782
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,246
I won't let you down.

783
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,699
I promise.

784
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,507
Man, you are really bad with the ladies.

785
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:04,849
What?
Ah

786
00:42:04,874 --> 00:42:05,895
Nothing.

787
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:28,933
You!

788
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,570
Help me!

789
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,311
The Moon is dying.

790
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,265
Hurry! I'm talking to you!

791
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,441
Do something!

792
00:42:46,589 --> 00:42:47,589
No!

793
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:52,247
No!

794
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,659
No!

795
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:45,761
Oh no!

796
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:47,151
Its the big black house!

797
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:48,753
Its the end of the world!

798
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:49,778
Aaaaaaaahahaha!

799
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:59,308
DARKNESS IS SPREADING ALL OVER THE PLANET.

800
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,333
HAHA! HAHA! HAHA!

801
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:03,019
Chaos! Hou hou hou! Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

802
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,870
Stop talking about chaos.

803
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,975
I'm gonna have nightmares again.

804
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:10,801
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

805
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,617
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

806
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,577
A chaos hou! A chaos hou!

807
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:34,452
Glimmmm!

808
00:44:34,477 --> 00:44:36,530
Hey! Unhand the lady!

809
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,254
Glim!

810
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,613
Glim, I'm coming!

811
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:44,508
I am here!

812
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:46,016
Let her go!

813
00:44:55,448 --> 00:44:56,467
Glim!

814
00:45:01,682 --> 00:45:02,849
Oh! Aaaah!

815
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:06,865
Ohaaaah!

816
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:09,525
Sohone!

817
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,335
Sohone, do something!

818
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I'm trying!

819
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:20,067
Up there you go!

820
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,247
You got him!

821
00:45:25,629 --> 00:45:27,169
The lightning monster!

822
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,255
He's gonna rip us apart!

823
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,877
Swim for your life, Mune!

824
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,589
Who're you callin' monster!

825
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:33,872
Snort fish.

826
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,604
Hey!

827
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:36,096
I am the guardian of the Sun.

828
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:37,181
Show some respect.

829
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,273
And I'm...

830
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:39,811
Phospho!

831
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,121
Are you The Guardian of the Underworld?

832
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:47,274
I used to be Guardian of the Moon, boko!

833
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:49,699
For that with one I wish you holding spray.

834
00:45:49,731 --> 00:45:52,565
Come on, Spiky, get the girl back now.

835
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:54,637
Atta boy!

836
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:56,319
A cute little chick.

837
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:57,770
Ignore to chat here, han.

838
00:45:58,104 --> 00:45:59,143
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

839
00:45:59,168 --> 00:46:00,897
We need to get to the underworld.

840
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,355
Necross has stolen the Sun.

841
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,632
So why didn't you stop him?

842
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:06,092
I thought you are the guardian?

843
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,543
He sent two little devils.

844
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:08,849
Wait. Hah.

845
00:46:08,874 --> 00:46:11,612
You got aborted by two little minions?

846
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,229
Ha! Ha! Ha!

847
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:14,470
No, but ...

848
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:16,029
Well its his fault.

849
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:17,335
Oh! Quit.

850
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:18,566
Its givin' me a headache.

851
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:19,658
Master Phospho!

852
00:46:20,495 --> 00:46:21,739
I was picked by accident.

853
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:22,419
But you...

854
00:46:22,444 --> 00:46:24,291
You are a real guardian.

855
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:25,686
We need your help.

856
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:28,501
I haven't heard that in a while.

857
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:29,541
So tell me.

858
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:31,793
Why try to take the Sun back?

859
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:34,003
To impress the ladies.

860
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:35,887
Ha! Ha!

861
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,010
Now you are talking?

862
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:43,071
Impress the ladies!
Aa

863
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:44,176
Brilliant!

864
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:06,958
Here we are.

865
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,603
On the road to the Underworld.

866
00:47:09,508 --> 00:47:12,890
Come on, it got a long and gloomy decade once.

867
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:13,915
What about Glim?

868
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,228
We can't leave her like this.

869
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,481
Oh right.

870
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:21,006
The chatty one.

871
00:47:22,323 --> 00:47:23,694
Move aside.

872
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,156
And let the artist work.

873
00:47:36,576 --> 00:47:38,102
Aaaaaaaaah!

874
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:39,711
Hands off!

875
00:47:39,736 --> 00:47:42,136
Is that any way to thank your Savior?

876
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,178
I strengthened your wax, girl!

877
00:47:44,203 --> 00:47:46,842
You should be more flexible for a change.

878
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,328
Or a little kissy will do.

879
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:50,288
Wow, Can I do that too?

880
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,891
Every guardian develops his own gift.

881
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,922
Here's clear

882
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:56,071
You're skrewing everything off.

883
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:57,540
Who is tha guy?

884
00:47:57,565 --> 00:47:59,457
He says he was the Guardian of the Moon.

885
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:00,871
Phospho, something!

886
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,185
Phospho!

887
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,295
But  the ancient books say ...

888
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:04,660
Come on!

889
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:06,193
This way!

890
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,738
Mune!

891
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:10,183
Thankyou.

892
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,910
For watching over for me.

893
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:14,048
Glim.

894
00:48:14,073 --> 00:48:15,987
You can hold on to me if you feeling scared.

895
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:17,968
May I hold on to you too

896
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:20,308
if I'm feelin' that we have been frightened?

897
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,409
No.

898
00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:22,698
Master Phospho.

899
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:24,476
I've read all the history books about him.

900
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,827
But you were actually there.

901
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:28,168
Could you tell us what really happened with Necross?

902
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,155
Necross huh?

903
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:33,879
Well, a traitor, he is simply a great guardian of the sun.

904
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:36,413
But he is not.

905
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:43,681
He tried to keep the Sun all for himself.

906
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,049
Luckily Xolal stoped him.

907
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:47,900
Xolal?

908
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,180
That dried ol prune?

909
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:51,084
Ya my friend, but then ...

910
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:54,241
He was the most powerful warrior on the planet.

911
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:58,523
So, there was a clash of titans. A nasty one.

912
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:01,705
He smashed Necross ...

913
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,025
... Pulled away down, into the underworld.

914
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,883
And the underworld's...

915
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:10,750
...whats waiting for you at the bottom of this casam.

916
00:49:11,265 --> 00:49:12,340
Wow!

917
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,715
But I don't understand why Xolal had to step in.

918
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,942
As Guardian of the Moon,

919
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,247
Weren't you supposed to watch over the harmony of the planet?

920
00:49:18,272 --> 00:49:20,053
Yes, and I did.

921
00:49:20,078 --> 00:49:22,037
I watched over the Moon.

922
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:26,809
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

923
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:29,558
But then why would you into exile after that?

924
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,352
Chapter 35 of the book 4 says ...

925
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:33,016
Somebody's gonna research, han ?

926
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,251
Well, if you know so much

927
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:37,394
I gues you won't need my help.

928
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,792
Aaaha, that's not what she meant. We

929
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:40,443
Good luck, kiddos.

930
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:43,816
Nice job.

931
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:45,434
What? I was just asking.

932
00:49:55,107 --> 00:49:56,126
The Temple!

933
00:49:56,151 --> 00:49:57,998
Whats it doing here?

934
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:05,190
The Moon?

935
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:06,221
No.

936
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:07,706
The Moon is gone.

937
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,074
The temple has gone insane.

938
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,690
I have to stop it.

939
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:12,139
We don't have time for that.

940
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:13,719
The sun is dying.

941
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,237
It might be too late already.

942
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:17,201
You take care of the Sun.

943
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,791
I have to save the Moon.

944
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,045
No, Mune, remember, the guardians are linked.

945
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,304
The ancient book sayaid ...

946
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,415
You really gotta stop reading those books, babe?

947
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,489
Come on.

948
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,197
Get lost, Marble head!

949
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,351
Goroun!

950
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:45,055
What are you doing here?

951
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:47,841
Come here boy!

952
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:54,139
Quick!

953
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:55,606
We have to catch him.

954
00:50:55,673 --> 00:50:57,617
Okay, now lets stop that temple!

955
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:59,375
We have a planet to save.

956
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,229
Go!

957
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:01,227
Yaaaaaaaaaah!

958
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:02,512
Wooooh!

959
00:51:04,178 --> 00:51:05,245
Aaaaaah!

960
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,164


961
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:18,996
Zzzzzzzzzzh!

962
00:51:32,946 --> 00:51:34,566
Carefullll!

963
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:36,148
Don't worry.

964
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,653
Huh!

965
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:39,080
This I know how to do.

966
00:51:52,573 --> 00:51:53,573
Hang on!

967
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:03,399
Mune, Don't leave me!
Ahh. Mune!!!!

968
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,967
Oh no, no, no, noooooo.

969
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:08,588
I don't know how to steer this thing!

970
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:16,619
Calm down!

971
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:17,353
Calm down!

972
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,195
Easy boy!

973
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,433
Calm down!

974
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,487
I'm here.

975
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:48,757
Its working!

976
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:51,835
Calm ...

977
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:53,870
... dowwwwwwwnnnn!

978
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:04,840
That was amazing!

979
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:11,791
Mune!

980
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:14,217
Mune!

981
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:19,794
Did you see that?

982
00:53:19,819 --> 00:53:21,529
My dudt worked on him!

983
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,344
Well, look at that.

984
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,517
The legend I got the temple to settle.

985
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:32,717
He's got guts!

986
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,010
Maybe more than I ever had it.

987
00:53:47,065 --> 00:53:49,098
Who is this?

988
00:53:49,361 --> 00:53:52,799
It looks like the Guardian of the Sun!

989
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,780
I am the Guardian of the Sun!

990
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,598
Is that the moron who lost the sun?

991
00:53:57,623 --> 00:53:58,258
Hey!

992
00:53:58,352 --> 00:54:00,462
What a loser!

993
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,035
Mune is the real hero.

994
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:06,182
You just cleanup .

995
00:54:06,316 --> 00:54:08,848
You are just a loser.

996
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:10,735
Useless!

997
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:12,516
Whats he doing now?

998
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,162
He wants to get by?

999
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:17,780
Moron!

1000
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,173
What a pathetic hope!

1001
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:24,383
You're the worst Guardian of the Sun ever.

1002
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,287
HA! HA! HA! HA!

1003
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:30,375
PATHETIC!

1004
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:34,348
IS THAT REALLY ONE YOU GOSH, SHERON!

1005
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:38,011
HE HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!

1006
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:39,971
Mother!

1007
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:44,529


1008
00:54:44,874 --> 00:54:45,874
Ah!

1009
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,570
Aaah!

1010
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,390
Oooooooh!

1011
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:49,013
Leeyoon!

1012
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,577
Leeyoon, Where're you?

1013
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,892
Ah, Leeyoon.

1014
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,113
What are you doing?

1015
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:54,565
Ah, Leeyoon!

1016
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,520
Come on!

1017
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,741
Wake up!

1018
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:57,885
Where is the Moon?

1019
00:54:57,932 --> 00:54:59,185
It died!

1020
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,428
I became a guardian and it died!.

1021
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:04,041
Everything went wrong.

1022
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:05,400
Why me?

1023
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:07,239
Why me?

1024
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:09,411
So this is the end!

1025
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:10,714
Its not fair.

1026
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,806
How could Necross betray me?

1027
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,545
I did everything he asked.

1028
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,383
Those lying snakes!

1029
00:55:17,408 --> 00:55:20,295
Those lying liars!

1030
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,818
Always picking on me.

1031
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:24,444
Oh, I'm in pretty quite love of already get to know me.

1032
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:25,929
Go then yourselves ...

1033
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:28,416
I will get a new Moon from the world of dreams.

1034
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,369
Who do you think you are?

1035
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:32,264
A God?

1036
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,636
You can't just create a Moon.

1037
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:36,403
The first guardian did.

1038
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,580
We're all doomed!

1039
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:42,122
Doomed, I tell you!

1040
00:55:42,147 --> 00:55:42,669
Huh?

1041
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:53,357
Come on Glim.

1042
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:54,858
Let's go!

1043
00:55:56,426 --> 00:55:58,371
Oh, Hey, wait for me.

1044
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,094
Aauuuuuuuu!

1045
00:56:00,655 --> 00:56:03,235
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1046
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,870
Hello!

1047
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:16,068
What's that?

1048
00:56:22,444 --> 00:56:23,557
Are we in the world of dreams?

1049
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,437
Nightmares ... Nightmare everywhere.

1050
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,269
Aaaaaaaaaah!

1051
00:56:33,573 --> 00:56:34,573
Stop!

1052
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:38,713
Wow!

1053
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:40,147
You did it again!

1054
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:41,284
Ya.

1055
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:43,711
I have got powers!

1056
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:50,740
Maybe the Moon was right afterall.

1057
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:51,763
Ha! Ha! Ha!

1058
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:53,112
Okay!

1059
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:55,424
Now I'm gonna show these ugly monsters

1060
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,091
Who the real master of dreams is.

1061
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,390
Enough with the nightmares.

1062
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,922
Lets have some dream!

1063
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:30,183


1064
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,778
The Moon core!

1065
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:41,985
I thought that was a legend!

1066
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,520
By the mighty power of the guardians,

1067
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,896
I command a new Moon to appear.

1068
00:58:28,982 --> 00:58:29,836
Mune!

1069
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:31,007
I saw him!

1070
00:58:31,032 --> 00:58:33,814
He carved a new Moon!

1071
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:34,994
Who cares!

1072
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,054
The sun is dying.

1073
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:38,451
And the Moon is a s good as dead

1074
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:44,783
This is ridiculous!

1075
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,249
This is embarrassing!

1076
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:51,170
They call him the Guardian of the Sun?

1077
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:53,091
Give me a break.

1078
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,704
Stop it!

1079
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,031
I'll fight you.

1080
00:58:56,149 --> 00:58:57,149


1081
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:58,358
Yes!

1082
00:58:58,438 --> 00:58:59,741
Such anger!

1083
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:01,067
So hatred!

1084
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:03,006
oh, whats happening to me?

1085
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:04,742
You are darker than Necross!

1086
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:06,184
Daemon!

1087
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,652


1088
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,856
You forked tongues mindless worms.

1089
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:17,510
I know you're nearby, Necross

1090
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:19,510
You've spread your chaos once.

1091
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:22,579
I won't get away with it again.

1092
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:23,682
PHOSPHO!

1093
00:59:24,348 --> 00:59:27,733
THAT USELESS FRAUD IS YOUR BACKUP!

1094
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:30,865
i'M SUPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE, MY OLD FRIEND.

1095
00:59:31,441 --> 00:59:35,968
I THOUGHT YOU BECLOUDING SOMEWHERE ... BEHIND THE ROCK!

1096
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,686
HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!

1097
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:40,146
Don't listen to these snakes, boko!

1098
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:43,744
Theyre trained to make evil just like they did with Necross.

1099
00:59:43,769 --> 00:59:44,344
Ah!

1100
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,217
Shut up, mop.

1101
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:48,921
I've enough of your old drooling face.

1102
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:52,954
I'll crush you into dust.

1103
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:03,307
Respect the mop, kiddo!

1104
01:00:04,486 --> 01:00:05,953
Back on your feet!

1105
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,320
ITS TOO LATE!

1106
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:20,949
How're you doing that?

1107
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:21,950
Ah!

1108
01:00:22,437 --> 01:00:23,270
I don't know.

1109
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:25,343
I just stam.

1110
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:29,701
Ah!

1111
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:54,060
I like dreaming with you.

1112
01:01:11,069 --> 01:01:13,062
Aaaaaaaaaah!

1113
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,412
I...

1114
01:01:18,947 --> 01:01:20,419
I had a funny dream!

1115
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:22,167
Ya!

1116
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:24,699
Uh, Me too.

1117
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:53,181
Mune!

1118
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:54,788
I misjudged you.

1119
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,503
Forgive me.

1120
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:59,557
You really are the Guardian of the Moon.

1121
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:05,119
Well ...

1122
01:02:05,144 --> 01:02:06,979
I better put this back in the sky then.

1123
01:02:07,631 --> 01:02:09,603
The moon can't shine without the Sun's light.

1124
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:11,505
They're connected.

1125
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,965
Like the guardians, remember?

1126
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,247
No time to lose then.

1127
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,525
Lets find Sohone.

1128
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:54,512
Calm down, kiddo.

1129
01:02:56,364 --> 01:02:58,121
Deep breath!

1130
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,345
Here,

1131
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:03,413
Take my energy!

1132
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:10,412
You look

1133
01:03:10,437 --> 01:03:12,727
much better when you shine.

1134
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:17,168
Phospho!

1135
01:03:18,225 --> 01:03:19,669
Phospho, what're you doing?

1136
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:22,093
I'm goin' out in style.

1137
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:25,059
For the ladies, right!

1138
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,246
No! Nooo!

1139
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,023
Thankyou Phospho!

1140
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:51,157
Now that was a great explosion!

1141
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,952
You're going to have to try a little harder.

1142
01:03:55,977 --> 01:03:56,611
Spleen!

1143
01:03:56,636 --> 01:04:00,139
YOU BUNCH OF EVIL SLOSHING IMBECILE!

1144
01:04:01,062 --> 01:04:04,082
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MYSELF!

1145
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,164
Sohone!

1146
01:04:12,017 --> 01:04:13,071
Sohone!

1147
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:14,262
Glim!

1148
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:15,289
Mune!

1149
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,658
I think I was never gonna see you again.

1150
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:19,750
Ha! Ha!

1151
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,357
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh!

1152
01:04:22,152 --> 01:04:23,942
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

1153
01:04:26,723 --> 01:04:28,564
We missed you too, my friend.

1154
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:31,167
Well!

1155
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:32,221
Shall we.

1156
01:04:59,787 --> 01:05:02,102
WELCOME GUARDIANS.

1157
01:05:02,127 --> 01:05:03,173
Necross!

1158
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:06,667
THE SUN AND THE MOON IN THE UNDERWORLD?!

1159
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:08,092
WHAT A TREAT!

1160
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:09,240
Hang on.

1161
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:12,992
Sohone, watch out!

1162
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:14,137
Get the sun.

1163
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:15,931
I'll take care of lava pan.

1164
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:17,567
Hum!

1165
01:05:17,662 --> 01:05:20,372
YOU SHALL KNOW COME FOR THEM FOR SUCH A FAILURE.

1166
01:05:20,397 --> 01:05:22,921
You  brought disgrace in the guardians of the Sun's honor.

1167
01:05:22,946 --> 01:05:24,939
I'm gonna enjoy crishing you.

1168
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:27,095
Quick, we gotta go.

1169
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,127
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

1170
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:43,148
You're mine, sucker

1171
01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:47,729
And right now your girlfriend is in the cluches of my evil accomplice.

1172


1173


1174
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:49,367
Yellow flowers are nice,

1175
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,996
But they're more fragile, right?

1176
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:52,589
Right ... and ...

1177
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,809
That's why I gotta go.

1178
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:55,080
Gotta water them.

1179
01:05:55,105 --> 01:05:56,419
Oh, ofcourse.

1180
01:05:56,444 --> 01:05:57,444
Bye then!

1181
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:00,002
Huh!

1182
01:06:00,087 --> 01:06:03,684
You thought you can spread darkness on my planet, huh?

1183
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,376
Then get away with it.

1184
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:08,732
Not on my watch.

1185
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,385
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

1186
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,240
THE SUN IS DEAD.

1187
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:23,496
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO SAVE YOU PLANET NOW.

1188
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,351
Oh Yaa?

1189
01:06:28,162 --> 01:06:30,162
Take this!

1190
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:32,340
HA HA HA!

1191
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:35,411
YOU BITE LIKE A MOSQUITO.

1192
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,748
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

1193
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,999
Ohh, that hurts!

1194
01:06:43,886 --> 01:06:45,246
Ha Ha Ha ha ha!

1195
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:53,773
Glim!

1196
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,467
Don't go any closer.

1197
01:06:57,882 --> 01:06:58,736
Got ya now.

1198
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,536
Its chaos time!

1199
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:47,334
Glim!

1200
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:50,370
She is gonna make a nice candle.

1201
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:53,169
Get your stinking breath out of my face.

1202
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,727
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

1203
01:07:58,421 --> 01:07:59,081
Glim!

1204
01:08:02,181 --> 01:08:03,181
Hhhhhh!

1205
01:08:32,723 --> 01:08:33,790
I saved the Sun!

1206
01:08:35,268 --> 01:08:35,727
Ya.

1207
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:37,261
You did.

1208
01:08:37,568 --> 01:08:39,699
You have to help Sohone.

1209


1210
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:41,221
No!

1211
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:43,179
No, I need to save you.

1212
01:08:43,204 --> 01:08:44,106
No.

1213
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:45,370
It's too late for me.

1214
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,537
But, you can defeat Necross!

1215
01:08:50,278 --> 01:08:52,653
I have seen your power.

1216
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:55,133
Go!

1217
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:56,829
My sandman.

1218
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:16,831
YOU THINK YOU CAN LIGHT THE SUN JUST BY PUFFING IT.

1219
01:09:16,856 --> 01:09:20,884
I'LL BLOW IT DOWN QUICKER THAN IT TOOK YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO MELT

1220


1221
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:24,576
YOU'RE TRAPED, LITTLE BLUE RAT.

1222
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:31,736
Sohone!

1223
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:33,598
Quick, Mune

1224
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:34,489
Get out of here!

1225
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,637
I can't hold it for long.

1226
01:09:36,662 --> 01:09:39,246
i HAVE ENOUGH OF YOU. DIE

1227
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:40,161
INSECTS.

1228
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:57,319
Ah! Huh!

1229
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:01,135
WhatS going on?

1230
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:04,270
I can feel it too.

1231
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:07,542
Let's show him what we're made of.

1232
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:10,895
Yah, lets finish him off.

1233
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:19,565
I got him.

1234
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:22,466
Nighty night!

1235
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:24,752
WHAT?

1236
01:10:25,172 --> 01:10:26,758
WHAT'VE YOU DONE TO ME?

1237
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:29,211
You're taking a nap, big guy.

1238
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:30,238
I put you to sleep.

1239
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,317
YOU DIRTY LITTLE BLUE RAT!

1240
01:10:34,418 --> 01:10:35,951
I am the master of dreams.

1241
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:37,814
There's nothing you can you do to me here.

1242
01:10:37,839 --> 01:10:39,078
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

1243
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,730
You really need a cook.

1244
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,728
Hold still, dummy.

1245
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:23,153
This snake has been squeezing your heart for too long.

1246
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:09,557
Mune!

1247
01:12:11,753 --> 01:12:12,339
Mune!

1248
01:12:14,095 --> 01:12:14,521
Huh?

1249
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:17,976
You pulledout the fires of the underworld.

1250
01:12:23,984 --> 01:12:25,737
That was epic!

1251
01:12:36,838 --> 01:12:38,571
I never thought I'd say this, but ...

1252
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:39,522
Bro!

1253
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,709
You really are the most powerful guardian of all time.

1254
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,159
You okay, Mox?

1255
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:57,079
I bloomed.

1256
01:12:57,864 --> 01:13:00,497
Hu hu hu!

1257
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,991
We're gonna be fine here.

1258
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:58,902
Thats Mune!

1259
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,206
The Guardian of the Moon.

1260
01:15:01,656 --> 01:15:03,616
Ya, I always knew he would make it.

1261
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:06,056
What?

1262
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:54,361
Glim!

1263
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,033
Glim!

1264
01:16:02,012 --> 01:16:04,304
This is gonna be good!

1265
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,368
Glim!

1266
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:23,437
Sohone!

1267
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:24,462
Glim!

1268
01:17:32,406 --> 01:17:34,617
Glim! Glim! I'm over here!

1269
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,538
Oh daddy loves you!

1270
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:39,515
Sweetheart! Glim look around. I'm on the left.

1271
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:23,326
My baby kid...

1272
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,768
Ooo, I love happy endings!

1273
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:03,157
Oops, My bad!

1274
01:19:03,181 --> 01:20:34,065
