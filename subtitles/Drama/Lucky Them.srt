1
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,940
I knew Matthew Smith for 15 years
before the night of his final show.

2
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,827
Everyone remembers
his talent and face.

3
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:28,924
But the Matthew I knew was

4
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:33,413
strange, funny, and
unbearably insecure.

5
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:37,054
Matthew didn't show up for
that show 10 years ago...

6
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,609
Or any other show after that.

7
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,784
He left us all behind.

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,274
He left me, his girlfriend,

9
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:46,912
speeding off into the night,

10
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:50,583

Hey, El?
Gonna go crazy.

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380
Yeah, I was that, uh... that maybe
we shouldn't do this anymore.

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,936
You're breaking up with me?

16
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:30,372
Well, you know, breaking up would imply
that we were actually going out, I guess.

17
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:32,132
We have been going out for
three months.

18
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:35,378
No, you've been coming over to
my apartment after shows for

19
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,545
three months... you
know, which is awesome.

20
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,097
I like having sex
with you, but...

21
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:40,399
Oh, wow.

22
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:43,820
...to date, I suppose one
would go out on dates.

23

That's what I'm saying.

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,156
It's just I like you, and
it's not that you're older.

25
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:51,247
At this point in my life, it's

26
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:54,818
just like I want something more
than just, like, casual sex,

27
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,310
and... and it doesn't
seem like you do.

28

Now I sound like a dick.

territory, and from where I'm

92

looking pretty bleak.

101
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,254
One of them was spam.

102
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,810
Apparently, that means the
world wide web finds your

current sensibility neither

You broke him, for
Christ's sake.

I know that there was a personal

116
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:50,150
element, but for God's
sake, it was 10 years ago.

117
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,590
You got to have enough distance

118
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:52,170
by now.

119
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,130
He's probably dead.

120
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,681
He's not dead.

121
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,034
He's just an asshole who's gone.

122

You are in a unique
position to do this.

125
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,231
You're sitting on a
huge fucking story.

126
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:08,923
The professional side of you
has got to understand that.

127
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,243
I am not sitting on a story,

128
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:11,262
okay?

129
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,064
I'm just not... picking at a

130
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:13,641
scab.

131
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,267
Okay, well, I cannot have you
ignore what's happening here

132
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,031
anymore.

133
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:18,918
We got to put a shock through

134
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,224
the system, and everybody's
got to do their part.

135
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:23,601
Don't make me do this.

136
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,243
You have to reclaim your

137
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:35,419
place at this magazine.

138
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,290
I mean, I do not get paid
enough to go there again.

139
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:39,271
Right.

140
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,289
I don't want to relive this.

141
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:42,177
So quit.

142
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,482
Mm. I can't quit my job.

143
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:45,744
It's always pride.

144
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,733
So write it.

145
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,270
Are there any other choices?

146
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,057
No.

147
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,027
Excuse me?

148
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,478
Do you want another?

149
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,062
But doesn't part of you
want to know what happened?

150
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:00,901
I'm trying to think what
I'd do if Angela just...

151
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,766
I mean, I couldn't handle it.

152
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,102
I'd have to know.

153
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,926
Well, how about this idea?

154
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,579
Let's not talk about it anymore.

155
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,339
Oh, now you're heading out?

156
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:12,235
Yeah. I've got a, uh,
singer to interview.

Hey.

175
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:06,125
Hey. You're the guy
from the other night.

176
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:09,797
Yes, the business card
instead of a buck.

177
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:14,034
Ah. I'm not always so cheap.

178
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,137
Pull up.

179
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,223
Okay, so, this is weird.

180
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,056
This is, like, my
first real interview.

181
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:20,296
Are you really as naive as

182
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,393
you seem?

183
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,898
I don't know. Am I?

184
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:24,429
Let's find out.

185
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:27,166
Okay, do you mind if I...
Yes, please.

186
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:28,174
Okay.

187
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,540
Record away.

188
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,103
This is all very professional.

189
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,072
Hello.

190
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,073
So... Uh, when did you
start writing music?

191
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,445
This morning.

192
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,633
See? Nobody... I have never

193
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,732
met anyone who can do that.

194
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:47,515
Me either.

195
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:50,840
Uh, so, performing on the street...
I mean, who does that anymore?

196
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,164
Does that? People do that.

197
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:52,864
I do that.

198
00:09:52,964 --> 00:09:53,695
You do do that.

199
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:54,678
I don't know.

200
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:55,878
I love to play, you know?

201
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,428
Mm.

202
00:09:56,598 --> 00:10:01,066
And, uh... I'm really
broke, so, uh, the

203
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,333
money helps.

204
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,896
But, uh, you know, business
cards are also welcome.

205
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:05,596
Oh.

206
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,928
Thanks for that.

207
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,303
Just, uh... you're welcome.

208
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,244
...hard to pay for the rent

209
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,505

210
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:17,582
Mm-hmm.

211
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,384
Hard to pay for groceries with

00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,196
Oh, no, no.

214
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:31,764
Oh, God.

215
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,385
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

216
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,221
You just... this cannot happen.

217
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:58,989
I'm... Drunk

Were you asleep?

228
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:03,239
It's 3:00 in the morning.

229
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,891
I remember a guy that used to
say the party was just getting

230
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,168
started at 3:00 A.M.

231
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:08,987
May I help you?

232
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,230
Well, I've decided to do the

233
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:12,896
no.

234
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,198
I decided that you do the

235
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:15,603
Matthew piece.

236
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,780
Okay, well, I'm agreeing to it.

237
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,504
I am just so overwhelmed.

238
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:28,581
Fucking nut-job.

239
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,796
Matthew, man... he was
intense, but in a fucking sexy

240
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:44,214
way.

241
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,717
I mean, we broke up three times,
but we always got back together.

242
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:48,877
I mean, he had his shit.

243
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:49,731
He had his demons.

244
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,272
But he... and he was talented,
as everybody knows.

245
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,326
But there is no way... there is
no way that he would have jumped.

246
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,716
Matthew... he was scared of heights...
<i>Is... Is scared of</i> heights...

247
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,294
Who was scared of heights?

248
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,422
Oh, this musician who's been
lost for years and years...

249
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,239
And years and years.

250
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,950
Really? Lost? Huh.

251
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,617
Charlie.

252
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:10,809
Ellie.

253
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,137
Ellie klug.

254
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:12,912
Okay.

255
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:15,503
It is good to see you.

256
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:16,232
Oh.

257
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:20,895
Coming in for an obligatory hug.

258
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:22,656
The timing wasn't
right when we dated.

259
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,697
I was emotionally unavailable.

260
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:27,386
Oh, yeah, that's, uh...
That's probably it.

261
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:30,914
I do think that your lack of
open-mindedness affected your

262
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,158
judgment of me.

263
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:33,739
I'm much cooler now.

264
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:34,439
Hmm?

265
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,972
Miss, could I get a clean

266
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:40,005
glass, a bottle of
water, and a whole lime?

267
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:40,458
No.

268
00:13:40,658 --> 00:13:42,116
Is she a friend of yours?

269
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:43,109
She's closing up.

270
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:44,994
We're going to a gig.

271
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,893
A gig? Huh.

272
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:47,987
A gig.

273
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,594
What kind of gig?

274
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,302
Uh, a music show.

275
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,051
A music gig.

276
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:56,419
Nah. That's not my scene.

277
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:57,216
Good.

278
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,576
What style music is it?

279
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:00,950
Alternative rock.

280
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,300
Hmm. Alt rock.

281
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,278
You may call it
that if you wish.

282
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,569
Okay.

283
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,904
"Okay" what?

284
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,869

293
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,735
I'm retired, but until

294
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,196
recently, I was in the
jewelry business.

295
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,217
Really?

296
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,171
Yeah, we had pieces crafted

297
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,626
from Mexican pesos, bits of

298
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,874
Caribbean currency, seashells.

299
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,034
Sold them online.

300
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:59,361
I got tired of it, so I dumped
the business last year.

301
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:02,841
Before that, I had a software
company and made about

302
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,977
$300 million on an I.P.A.,
so I can pay the rent.

303
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:07,857
Yeah, but you were rich
before that, right?

304
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:08,533
It's true.

305
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,073
I come from one of the oldest

306
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,243
families in north America, but

307
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,391
truth be told, we lost our

308
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:16,981
fortune in the panic of 1907.

309
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,050
1907.

310
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,049
Anyway, lately, I've
been taking some

311
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:23,866
documentary-filmmaking
classes, and I love it.

312
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,613
I really think it's what I'm

313
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,975
meant to do in this world.

314
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:28,734
I do.

315
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:30,817
What do you do again, Ellie?

316
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,244
I'm a music critic.

317
00:15:32,444 --> 00:15:34,992
Ugh! That would be the
worst job for me.

318
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,465
I hate music.

319
00:15:36,665 --> 00:15:38,372
All music you hate.

320
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,492
Is the bear a catholic?

321
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:40,604
I mean, really.

322
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,816
I think he might be.

323
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:43,248
I mean, you like music?

324
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:44,530
Okay, well, I'm beat.

325
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,001
I am so exhausted.

326
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,078
Uh... it was really great seeing

327
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:49,799
you, Charlie, but we... okay.

328
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,495
...dana... do we?

329
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:51,710
Yeah.

330
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,874
You know what?

331
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,645
Maybe we could get
lunch sometime.

332
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:56,701
I haven't seen you in five

333
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,849
years, and, uh, it could
be nice to see you again.

334
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:00,604
Uh, I say... yes!

335
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:02,720
I should be clear
about one thing.

336
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,635
Uh, I'm off dating, so...

337
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:08,296
Great. That takes the pressure
off of me to do all the

338
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:09,455
work in bed.

339
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,515
Do you want to... you want to...

340
00:16:11,715 --> 00:16:12,955
Or do you want to write it?

341
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:14,494
You know what? I'll get it.

342
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:15,815
There's a crispness to my

343
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:19,367
writing that I enjoy.

344
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:22,755
"Ellie... klug."

345
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:25,951
Good night, girls.

346
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:31,876
So, uh... the design
on this site is so...

347
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:32,576
Just sad.

348
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,982
There was a time, my little
friend, when it was actually

349
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:37,489
difficult to build a website.

350
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,780
What are you finding?

351
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,682
There's a message board where

352
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,838
people post sightings.

353
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:45,930
All these people claim
to have seen him?

354
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,259
Claim to, yes.

355
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,383
Here's one for you this year.

356
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,611
Should I e-mail?

357
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:54,179
It does not look like it, but
we can comment on his post.

358
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,566
Send him my e-mail,
ask for more info.

359
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,359
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Don't.

360
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,809
Yeah, do, do.

361
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,057
Ellie?

362
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:08,473
I meant to call you.

363
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:09,514
Yeah?

364
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,469
I, uh... I just... I-I

365
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,216
couldn't write the feature.

366
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,739
Couldn't... couldn't
write it this month?

367
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,096
What do you mean?

368
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,936
It just felt wrong... somehow.

369
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:19,977
Felt wrong?

370
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,577
What are you... what
are you saying?

371
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,842
You're not gonna write it?

372
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,128
Okay. Is this because we kissed?

373
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:27,149
Whoop!

374
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,750
Uh, could you answer
that, please?

375
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,973
Ellie klug's desk.

376
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:35,619
Wow. Well, that sucks.

377
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:36,910
It's giles.

378
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,244
Hey, can I call you back?

379
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:40,944
What's up?

380
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,085
How's the story going?

381
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:45,273
Well, I can't do it if you
keep talking to me, can I?

382
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:46,793
Okay. I didn't know
you had a son.

383
00:17:46,937 --> 00:17:47,884
Ha ha. Very funny.

384
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:48,607
Back to work.

385
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:49,334
I don't even get, like, a

386
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:49,915
blurb?

387
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:52,515
I don't even get, like, a little
side blurb, like, the blurb

388
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:53,243
underneath the blurb?

389
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:54,239
What do you want me to do?

390
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:54,959
I don't know.

391
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,447
Apologize, maybe.

392
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:58,125
Okay. Okay.

393
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:01,980
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

394
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,351
Well, apology accepted...
Hesitantly.

395
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:07,352
Do you want to go out

396
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:08,199
sometime?

397
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:11,647
Hey, look, if you're not gonna write
the story, we might as well, right?

398
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:12,621
What? No.

399
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:13,321
Yeah.

400
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,286
Listen, whatever you
think is gonna happen...

401
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:15,961
Yeah?

402
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,511
...is not gonna happen.

403
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:21,158
No? So, you're gonna crush my dreams and
then you're not gonna give me a date?

404
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,787
Oh, you seem fine to me.

405
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,744
I'm not fine.

406
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:28,073
I'm broken.

407
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:40,566
So... who's, uh...
Who's the looker?

408
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:52,230
That is not intern-level intel...
Sir.

409
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,097
He says that's Matthew.

410
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,615
Could be anybody.

411
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,384
He's in Washington... Hobart, I

412
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,310
guess.

413
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,502
He wants 1,000 bucks.

414
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:18,732
Oh, I know. I know.

415
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:22,773
I know we don't do that, so...

416
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:23,775
don't do what?

417
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:25,486
Hmm? Pay for sources.

418
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,262
Pay for sources? What are we?

419
00:19:27,462 --> 00:19:27,865
The national enquirer?

420
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:28,812
<i>The national enquirer?</i>

421
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,634
<i>We don't pay for sources.</i>

422
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,353
We don't pay for sources.

423
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:33,744
I can't believe you'd
actually make...

424
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:36,207
That kind of suggestion.

425
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,845
I could get fired.

426
00:19:39,045 --> 00:20:09,973
Uh... he wants cash.

427
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:11,970

437
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:43,192
So, listen, I've been doing a

438
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:46,434
lot of serious thinking, and,
uh, all joking aside, I-I think

439
00:20:46,634 --> 00:20:47,244
I'm willing to give you a second

440
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:48,480
chance.

441
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,783
Clearly, all those years of
playing music have left you with

442
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,106
a serious hearing problem.

443
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:54,237
Come on. What is it?

444
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:55,504
Is it me? Is it my music?

445
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:56,873
Is my face funny-looking?

446
00:20:57,073 --> 00:20:58,386
I mean, what? Give me something.

447
00:20:58,586 --> 00:20:59,175
Nope. Yeah.

448
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,244
I don't know.

449
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:01,867
"No, yes, I don't know."

450
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,884
What? I didn't get any of that.

451
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,744
Musicians, I mean, men...

452
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:08,299
Toxic to me, and you're both, so it's...
it's... it's not

453
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,293
personal.

454
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,584
It's not personal.

455
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:15,406
How can you say
that's not personal?

456
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:36,193
Shit.

457
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:45,507
Hey.

458
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:48,272
I need your help.

459
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:49,119
Shoot.

460
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,922
I need you to come with me

461
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:54,316
tomorrow morning to interview
this guy who says he knows where

462
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,058
Matthew is.

463
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:55,758
I can't.

464
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:56,937
I got groundwater thing.

465
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:57,668
Oh, come on.

466
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:58,905
Don't make me go alone.

467
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:01,425
And Angela's finally going with
me, and you know she hates

468
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:02,176
my "causes."

469
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:03,809
Hello? Excuse me.

470
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:19,604
Yes. I see you. Yeah.

471
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,241
Oh, no! Fuck!

472
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,143
Shit!

473
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,857
I promise it's gonna be fine.

474
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:30,755
No, I am gonna get fired

475
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:32,089
or... fucking sued or both.

476
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,569
Giles isn't gonna
do that to you.

477
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,030
He already basically said
that I'm irrelevant.

478
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,623
Ellie, please call and
get it over with.

479
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,664
Oh, yes, and in other news...
Who's Lucius?

480
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:43,813
It's... can you read?

481
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:44,544
It's Lucas.

482
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:45,704
Lucas. I'm sorry.

483
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:47,903
It's the singer that I
didn't do the story on.

484
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:49,892
He keeps... and I keep...

485
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:51,538
Well, what'd he say?

486
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,027
Did you listen to it?

487
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:54,777
Should you listen to it?

488
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,616
Well, then delete it because you

489
00:22:57,816 --> 00:22:59,345
know how it plays out.

490
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,345
What about that guy?

491
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,479
What guy?

492
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,134
The rich guy from the... the

493
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:05,100
fundraiser at the bar.

494
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,360
Oh, God. Charlie?

495
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,699
Yeah, he likes you,
and he's got money.

496
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,385
And... and he can help you.

497
00:23:10,585 --> 00:23:11,105
No. No way.

498
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:11,931
No... no way.

499
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,102
I am not doing that.

500
00:23:13,302 --> 00:23:14,939
Well, you should.

501
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:21,131
I have some pride.

502
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,467
So, you think he's still

503
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:23,110
alive.

504
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,962
Yeah, I do.

505
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:25,415
He just ditched you?

506
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:26,895
Well, I mean, not
ditched, but...

507
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:29,695
And then disappeared, never
to be heard from again?

508
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:31,563
Yeah, except maybe for this

509
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:34,159
guy who says he saw him in
a bar a few months ago.

510
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:34,922
Wow.

511
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,373
This is really
interesting to me.

512
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:41,586
Okay. I'll give you the
money to find that guy.

513
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,304
You will? Oh, really?

514
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:44,030
Mm-hmm.

515
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,070
But it's conditional.

516
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:46,173
Okay?

517
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:48,463
Lately, I've been taking some

518
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:51,601
documentary-filmmaking courses
at a local junior college.

519
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:55,090
I've been looking for something
that really speaks to me.

520
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,511
Speaks to me... right here.

521
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:58,711
Okay, so you want to do a

522
00:23:59,003 --> 00:23:59,934
story about Matthew.

523
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,080
No. I want to do a

524
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,075
documentary about<i> you</i> trying to

525
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:05,609
find Matthew.

526
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:06,182
No, no, no.

527
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:09,112
I don't want to be
in your documentary.

528
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:26,396
And I don't want to
just give you $1,000.

529
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,361
What do you think?

530
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:31,369
Jesus. What's this?

531
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:33,247
What the hell is this?

532
00:24:33,447 --> 00:24:35,815
Well, anyone who makes movies

533
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:37,295
has one of these, so this one is

534
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,211
I did.

535
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:42,227
They just delivered it.

536
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,230
What do you think?

537
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,952
Uh... permission
to board granted,

538
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,316
my lady.

539
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:55,527
You know how to drive, right?

540
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,756
What are you doing?

541
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:57,996
Interviewing you.

542
00:24:58,696 --> 00:24:59,326
What? Now?

543
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:00,369
Why not?

544
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,065
It's for the documentary.

545
00:25:02,265 --> 00:25:03,818
Because I'm basically driving

546
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,600
a submarine on wheels and I'm

547
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,387
not exactly a strong
driver, so...

548
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:09,912
Well, let me just tell you...

549
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:11,841
You are piloting this submarine

550
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:13,961
on wheels brilliantly.

551
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:18,102
Interview 1, take 1...
Ellie klug.

552
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:20,562
And... action.

553
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,751
Okay.

554
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:25,257
Uh... so... so, Matthew Smith's

555
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,045
music is unique in that it was a

556
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:29,259
blend of... cut! What is that?

557
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,187
That's, uh... I mean, I don't
really care about that.

558
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,904
Is that, like, music
criticism or something?

559
00:25:35,104 --> 00:25:36,024
Yeah, that's what I do.

560
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:36,878
Right.

561
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,799
Well, I don't care about that.

562
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:41,421
And I'm fairly certain that
anybody that views this

563
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:42,979
documentary won't care, either.

564
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:43,900
You know what?

565
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,249
I think I'm just gonna focus on

566
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,266
the road here... if
that's okay with you.

567
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:49,948
Okay. Hostile interview.

568
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:50,418
Cut.

569
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:51,793
You know what?

570
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:54,224
I'm just gonna get some, uh,

571
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:56,615
various shots of the landscape.

572
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:58,728
You know, we call it "b" roll

573
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:00,819
in, uh, filmmaking.

574
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,575
It's for editing.

575
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,553
You're not gonna understand it.

576
00:26:04,753 --> 00:26:19,343
It's over your head.

577
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,236
This better be the right way.

578
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:23,597
How you feeling?

579
00:26:23,797 --> 00:26:25,151
Uh... anxious.

580
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,764
You know, it'd be good for me and
the documentary film that we're

581
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,086
shooting if you could expound
on your feelings and whatnot.

582
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:31,769
I don't want to
expound on it, okay?

583
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,355
I'm anxious.

584
00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:46,135
It's been a long time.

585
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:48,440
Okay. There he is. That's him.

586
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,225
That... that's Matthew?

587
00:26:52,425 --> 00:27:02,585
What? No.

588
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,625
- Hey.
- Hi.

589
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,520
- Joshua?
- Yes.

590
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:09,966
You, uh... you guys
want to have a seat?

591
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,400
No. I'd invite you in, but, uh,

592
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,226
the place is kind of a mess.

593
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,870
So, that... that... that

594
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,570
video you sent, where
was that recorded?

595
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,401
Yeah. Um... can I ask...
Did... did you

596
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,324
bring the money?

597
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:24,924
I'm sorry to ask up front like
this.

598
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:26,148
It's just I've been burned

599
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:27,421
before, you know?

600
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:30,711
So I thought if we'd just get
this out of the way, then we'll

601
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,190
be more comfortable.

602
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,097
Sure. Uh, well, actually,

603
00:27:34,297 --> 00:27:35,975
maybe I can give you, uh, half

604
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:37,905
now and then half when your

605
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:40,555
information leads to Matthew.

606
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:43,251
Okay, yeah. Sounds fair.

607
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:51,201
Okay.

608
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,147
Great. Thanks.

609
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,856
So, I mean, what was it about

610
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:56,776
this guy that made you
think it was Matthew?

611
00:27:56,804 --> 00:27:57,484
Hang on a second.

612
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:57,847
Hang on.

613
00:27:58,047 --> 00:27:58,547
Whoa.

614
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,943
What's this about?

615
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,836
Oh, we're making a
documentary about this.

616
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:03,536
Great.

617
00:28:03,728 --> 00:28:04,545
Rolling.

618
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:08,026
Let me, uh... let me
tidy up the scene for

619
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,542
you.

620
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:13,223
So... you said you knew where...
where Matthew was?

621
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:14,491
Oh, yeah.

622
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,443
He, uh... he lives close by.

623
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:19,769
Where is he, exactly?

624
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,892
Uh... do you want me
to just go get him?

625
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:24,561
You know what?

626
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:25,647
I'll... I'll go get him.

627
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:26,563
Just stay put.

628
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:29,450
He lives like 10 minutes
away, 10 minutes's walk.

629
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,490
Uh, so I'll just grab him
and come right back.

630
00:28:31,602 --> 00:28:32,442
Should we come with you?

631
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:32,734
Uh, no.

632
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,587
Well, he doesn't know I'm coming,
so I'll... I'll just grab him.

633
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:36,720
We'll be right back.

634
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,891
Just, uh, hang tight.

635
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,154
Just make... make
yourself at home.

636
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:44,299
Be right back.

637
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:49,527
We trust you... sir!

638
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,258
Oh, great. Lucas.

639
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:09,649
Is it all the way out?

640
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:10,349
Yes.

641
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,036
Does it look cool?

642
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:15,198
There's so many switches in
here, it's like a spaceship.

643
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:20,625
Kidding me?

644
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:34,671
Charlie?

645
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,802
What's going on here?

646
00:29:36,002 --> 00:29:38,976
Uh, we're just... we're just waiting for...
for Joshua to

647
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:39,946
come back.

648
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:40,646
Joshua?

649
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:43,513
The guy that lives
in that trailer.

650
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:45,266
He was just here.

651
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,747
Don't no one live in that
trailer, 'cause I know who live

652
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,241
in my trailer.

653
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:49,019
It sure looked like he lived

654
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:49,719
in there.

655
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:50,805
This is<i> your</i> trailer?

656
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,849
I'm gonna need you
off my property.

657
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:53,160
Okay.

658
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,465
Well... yep. Yep. Yep.

659
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:59,072
We're out of here.

660
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:02,752
Have a great night.

661
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:04,607
Maybe we should call the police.

662
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:06,363
What are they gonna do?

663
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:09,373
Apart from arrest me for being

664
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,227
completely... naive and stupid.

665
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,278
Well, the good news is... you
can take your time paying me

666
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:14,688
back.

667
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,559
Of course, I'll have to charge

668
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,688
you interest.

669
00:30:19,888 --> 00:30:23,230
Please tell me you're joking.

670
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,110
Charlie?

671
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,289
Yes, I'm joking.

672
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,092
But we're not gonna quit,

673
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,878
okay?

674
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,428
This is nowhere near the end of

675
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:31,088
it.

676
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,010
Uh... this is a complete and

677
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,444
utter dead end.

678
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:37,210
We have the video.

679
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,779
The video is just
some stupid bait.

680
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:40,219
You can't even see who's really

681
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:40,788
playing.

682
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:41,532
Come on.

683
00:30:41,732 --> 00:30:42,793
Listen to me.

684
00:30:42,993 --> 00:30:44,875
You have an obligation to your

685
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:47,394
story, to your magazine, and,

686
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:50,951
most importantly, to me to
complete a documentary film that

687
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,201
we set out to make.

688
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:53,881
And I don't have
enough footage, okay?

689
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,169
I have like three minutes, and

690
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:59,327
most of it is him running
away up that hill.

691
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,890
Well, I-I am not an
investigative reporter.

692
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,080
I am a music critic.

693
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,724
I don't know what the
hell I'm doing, so...

694
00:31:09,924 --> 00:31:13,976
Then let's find
someone who does.

695
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:21,711
This is a note he... he left me.

696
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:22,431
This is the last

697
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,902
communication he had with you?

698
00:31:26,102 --> 00:31:28,152
Yes.

699
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,039
"Babe, well, it's been a run,

700
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,157
honey, a real run, a sprint at

701
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:35,131
times.

702
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:37,143
Does this got to be?

703
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,915
Yeah, for me, and I say for you.

704
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,799
I'm in a dark place.

705
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,507
You know, what comes
up must come down.

706
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:48,774
I know you understand.

707
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:49,874
Matthew."

708
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,230
What do you think?

709
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,615
What is he talking about?

710
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,520
I don't know.

711
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,941
It's just... it's him.

712
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:57,773
But he says, "I know
you understand."

713
00:31:57,973 --> 00:32:00,285
Well, I don't.

714
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,417
I don't think it's useful.

715
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:04,257
Don't you want to analyze
it or something?

716
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:04,763
Why?

717
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:05,866
I don't know.

718
00:32:06,066 --> 00:32:08,884
Just, like, figure out where
the paper was manufactured or

719
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:10,044
analyze his handwriting.

720
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,797
I don't know.

721
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:14,101
What? Do you think it's
not his handwriting?

722
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:15,892
No. It is.

723
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:18,078
You know what?

724
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:20,492
We have a video.

725
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:23,873
It's crude, but it's a
documentation of sorts.

726
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,375
Okay, yeah.

727
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,509
Okay, I have this
video of him singing.

728
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,645
Well, it<i> sounds like him.</i>

729
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,997
<i>Maybe you can take a look at it,
</i> maybe you can take a look at it,

730
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,884
like, isolate the
voice or something.

731
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,369
I-I think you have some wrong

732
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,861
expectations about what I do.

733
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:38,131
I follow people.

734
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,295
Living people.

735
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:41,087
Would you like this back?

736
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:42,931
You don't need it?

737
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:47,064
No.

738
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,139
You know, I think maybe I
should take on your case.

739
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:53,646
You can't take on the case because
you're not a private detective, Charlie.

740
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,596
We need to go back to the

741
00:32:55,796 --> 00:33:00,246
beginning, back to the
scene of the crime.

742
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,945
And this one... it's a move that

743
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,714
I invented.

744
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,906
It's a pistol whip.

745
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:07,370
A gunslinger whip.

746
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,723
A gunslinger tilt.

747
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:10,120
You ready?

748
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,589
You ready?

749
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:12,524
Action.

750
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,764
How old were you when
you met Matthew Smith?

751
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:16,750
I was 16.

752
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,571
In the interest of

753
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:21,068
documentary filmmaking,
just elaborate.

754
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:26,103
I was 16 when I met
Matthew Smith.

755
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:29,504
Here at this camp.

756
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:32,719
Mm... that was a little
dry, emotionally.

757
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,391
Want to try it again?

758
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:36,599
This is where we had
our first kiss.

759
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,843
Really? How was it?

760
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:40,050
Too much tongue.

761
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,163
I mean, neither of us knew what

762
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:44,288
we were doing.

763
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,818
We got much better
at it over time.

764
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:48,723
That was it? Just kissing?

765
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:51,316
Yeah. That was a big
deal for me back then.

766
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:54,952
I wasn't exactly... confident.

767
00:33:55,152 --> 00:33:56,681
Nobody here was.

768
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:57,398
Why?

769
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:00,940
Why weren't you confident?

770
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,539
It was, uh... it was...

771
00:34:03,739 --> 00:34:05,876
It was a weight-loss camp.

772
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:08,098
Weight-loss camp? Hang on.

773
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:09,658
You met at fat camp?

774
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,339
It's not funny, Charlie.

775
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:12,224
Fat camp.

776
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:14,474
Fat camp is a little funny.

777
00:34:14,674 --> 00:34:16,085
Stop saying "fat camp."

778
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:19,449
Well, did they call it
something else, like

779
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:21,350
k-a-m-p p-h-a-t?

780
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,468
Come here.

781
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:26,163
This is where we he
wrote his first song.

782
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,735
Performed it at talent night.

783
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:33,025
Oh, God, it was
really beautiful.

784
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:34,416
Yeah?

785
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,771
What'd you do?

786
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:39,245
I cried.

787
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:42,791
No, f-for talent night.

788
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,842
Oh. I, uh... I hula-hooped.

789
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:51,211
Did you terrify small children?

790
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:54,358
Shut up.

791
00:34:54,558 --> 00:34:56,806
After camp, you know, we said

792
00:34:57,006 --> 00:35:03,366
we'd stay in touch.

793
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,990
Yeah. He wrote me these...

794
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:14,843
Really beautiful letters.

795
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:19,182
Is that enough?

796
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:24,213
You know, I got to figure out

797
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,612
how to get this footage on
to my new editing system.

798
00:35:27,812 --> 00:35:29,499
Or you know what?

799
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,840
Maybe I can just edit on here.

800
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,267
That was weird.

801
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,849
I don't think you're letting

802
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,544
yourself see the new me.

803
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:44,504
Charlie, neither of us are new.

804
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:45,653
Pbht!

805
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,661
I just think that
you and I could...

806
00:35:47,861 --> 00:35:49,553
Okay, don't do take this

807
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:52,678
personally, but I'm not looking.

808
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:55,378
Seriously, I'm... I'm not.

809
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:56,546
That's cool.

810
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:58,096
It's totally cool.

811
00:35:58,296 --> 00:36:00,210
That's a gracious rejection.

812
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,332
I don't know why I'd
take that personal.

813
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:06,160
I'm gonna hit the hay.

814
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,513
I'll take the rear bunk.

815
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:12,255
And you're in the,
uh, forward deck.

816
00:36:12,455 --> 00:36:15,489
Okay. Solo.

817
00:36:15,689 --> 00:36:19,472
Good night.

818
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:22,246
Night.

819
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,189
Ready? Ready?

820
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:27,519
And... action.

821
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,194
This is where Matthew first

822
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:33,098
started playing.

823
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,321
Man, he loved it here.

824
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:37,472
I used to, uh... I used to sneak
out of college to come see him.

825
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:41,788
Then we'd go on the
road together and...

826
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:45,407
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

827
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:46,659
Actually, you know what?

828
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,281
It... it wasn't that much fun.

829
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:49,980
Everybody wanted him, and it was

830
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,313
like I got into some kind of

831
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:59,149
fucked-up conga line.

832
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,992
Was this the place?

833
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:03,257
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

834
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:04,989
Uh, they found his car over

835
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:06,948
there.

836
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:11,392
That's a long way down.

837
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,829
No one could survive that...
No one.

838
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:14,764
Charlie.

839
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:31,247
I'm sorry. My bad.

840
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,309
I think that Matthew may have

841
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,257
been left-handed.

842
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:36,297
Yeah, he was.

843
00:37:36,497 --> 00:37:37,931
Really?

844
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,193
Mm.

845
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,297
So, did you know Matthew Smith?

846
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,412
I knew him.

847
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:50,314
I mean, I didn't know him,
know him, but I-I-I knew him.

848
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:52,874
I mean, if I've seen the inside
of his house, I've seen the

849
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,703
inside of his house, but a lot

850
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:56,566
of people have seen the
inside of that guy's house.

851
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:57,747
He was hugely talented.

852
00:37:57,947 --> 00:37:58,041
Hugely.

853
00:37:58,108 --> 00:37:58,406
<i>Hugely.</i>

854
00:37:58,606 --> 00:38:01,566
<i>What does... what does</i> what does...
what does Matthew Smith's music mean to

855
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:01,793
you?

856
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:05,343
He was a huge influence on my

857
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:08,207
music, all my friends's music...

858
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,100
Maybe all music, I
mean, music itself.

859
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,580
People talk about cobain,
but fuck cobain.

860
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,465
He could have been so much more.

861
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:16,177
He could have been our

862
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,213
generation's... voice.

863
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:20,136
There's people that kind of

864
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:22,999
come and go in the music scene

865
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,718
whose "ghosts" always
live on, you know?

866
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,973
And he's definitely one of them.

867
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:31,804
I mean, you guys... you guys

868
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,707
were pretty tight, right?

869
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:36,096
We got wasted a couple times.

870
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:38,949
And did he ever seem like he,
you know, just wanted to...

871
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,705
...disappear?

872
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:44,982
What the hell do I know?

873
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:46,963
I bounce drunks.

874
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:47,663
Lucas.

875
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,786
There she is. How you doing?

876
00:38:49,986 --> 00:38:50,648
Yeah, good.

877
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,556
Uh, Lucas... uh, this is Lucas.

878
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:53,854
Lucas, this is Charlie.

879
00:38:54,054 --> 00:38:56,148
He's making a documentary
I'm helping him with.

880
00:38:56,348 --> 00:38:57,034
How's it going?

881
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:57,758
Good.

882
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:01,448
Um... man, you never
called me back.

883
00:39:01,648 --> 00:39:04,815
Yeah. I just, uh... yeah.

884
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,257
These things happen.

885
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:08,617
Hey, you should, uh... you
should at least have one of

886
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:09,193
these.

887
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:11,943
Here, you too, man.

888
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,172
No, sir.

889
00:39:13,372 --> 00:39:14,954
When did you get these made?

890
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,510
Uh, last week, actually.

891
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,630
These look really good.

892
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:18,045
Yeah?

893
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:19,135
Yeah. Good for you.

894
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:20,015
Thanks very much.

895
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,492
Hey, if you guys are free
tonight, you should come down

896
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:22,525
the street.

897
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,471
I'm playing a little gig on the

898
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,238
stage, so not just a sidewalk

899
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:28,077
and drunk people yelling at me.

900
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:29,317
Yeah, sure. Why not? Yeah.

901
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:29,859
Do you want to?

902
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:30,559
Of course.

903
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:31,901
You should come, too, man.

904
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:32,971
Wait. What?

905
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:37,173
You... you want to
come, Charlie, or...

906
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:37,813
Now?

907
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,326
We're... we're quitting?

908
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:40,541
I think we're good for tonight.

909
00:39:40,741 --> 00:39:43,655
I mean, if you guys are doing your
thing, you know, maybe I'll see you.

910
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:44,710
I don't want to...

911
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,017
Let's go. Go with you now.

912
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,177
All right, cool. Then...

913
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,399
Hey, see you later, Doug.

914
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,739
Um, good luck with the doc, man.

915
00:39:53,939 --> 00:40:01,931
What just happened, man?

916
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,881
Thank you, guys.

917
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:09,673
Um, okay, this is a new one,

918
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:11,858
and, uh, I haven't really played

919
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,818
it before live, so
we'll see how it goes.

920
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:16,971
But, uh, I wrote it
for someone special.

921
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,380
I know that sounds cheesy, but,

922
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,749
uh, it's true.

923

924
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:34,096

00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:21,311
alarm clock.

933
00:41:21,511 --> 00:41:24,248
Sure. Just follow you around...

934
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,983
...singing all the time.

935
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:26,779
Yeah.

936
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:29,312
Wow. Someone singing songs

937
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:30,586
written about me.

938
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:32,874
Hasn't happened in a long time.

939
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,004
Actually, um, I didn't... I

940
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:36,988
didn't write that one about you.

941
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:37,950
Oh, my God.

942
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,199
No, I-I-I wrote it for this,

943
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:42,065
uh, guy I met in prison.

944
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,001
His name's Bobby. "Big Bob."

945
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,419
Big Bob?

946
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:46,648
Big bog.

947
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:48,524
Big Bobby.

948
00:41:48,724 --> 00:41:53,285
Big Bob was a sweetheart.

949
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,920
Here we are.

950
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,028
Wow.

951
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:57,992
Yeah.

952
00:41:58,192 --> 00:42:01,963
What are we gonna do today?

953
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:03,474
I don't know.

954
00:42:03,674 --> 00:42:04,942
Well, you know what?

955
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:08,716
I-I think we should do something

956
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,829
really stupid.

957
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,157
Like, really stupid.

958
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:14,030
Let's do this!

959
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:16,903
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

960
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:20,404
Terrible, terrible idea.

961
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,531
Oh, my God.

962
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:23,873
You're a madman.

963
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,084
What was that?

964
00:42:25,284 --> 00:42:26,978
Put something on. Here.

965
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,021
I can't feel my testicles.

966
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:33,405
That outfit is... fantastic.

967
00:42:33,605 --> 00:42:35,803
Man, you got a lot of records.

968
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:38,821
And, by the way, who the
hell still has cds?

969
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:39,582
I do.

970
00:42:39,782 --> 00:42:41,157
That is a lot of cds.

971
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:45,295
Man, it is crazy that you
used to hang with him.

972
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:47,678
Like, you used to hang
out with Matthew Smith.

973
00:42:47,878 --> 00:42:53,301
Yeah, well... that's insane.

974
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,639
Dude's, like, my idol.

975
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,763
No kidding.

976
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:58,600
And why did he kill himself?

977
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,243
It's like if I had half the

978
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:06,181
talent that this guy had...

979
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:07,456
That is the best song.

980
00:43:07,656 --> 00:43:10,049
"Inside"? I love that song.

981
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:13,026
I used to listen to that song on

982
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:15,298
repeat in eighth grade.

983
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:17,000
Hi. You guys ready to order?

984
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,962
Uh... the salad.

985
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:18,783
The dressing.

986
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:19,483
Yes?

987
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,335
Does that have dairy?

988
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:22,335
I can check for you.

989
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:24,778
I'm extremely
lactose-intolerant.

990
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,159
If it has dairy, uh, I can't
have it anywhere near me.

991
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,653
Okay.

992
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:30,857
Also, I will have the toast,
but you'll need to burn that

993
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:32,457
because I cannot
ingest live gluten.

994
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:35,142
Okay, so, I'll... I'll just
take the, uh... the burger,

995
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:37,547
medium-rare, please.

996
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,095
Thank you.

997
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:42,489
So, I met a sound specialist
who thinks he might be able to

998
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:43,846
do something with the video.

999
00:43:44,046 --> 00:43:44,546
Hmm.

1000
00:43:44,616 --> 00:43:46,998
I think I might be a better

1001
00:43:47,198 --> 00:43:49,851
investigative journalist than I

1002
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:52,378
am a documentary filmmaker.

1003
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:54,268
Well, Ellie, I think I have

1004
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,480
found the woman that I am going

1005
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,709
to spend the rest of my life

1006
00:43:58,909 --> 00:44:01,197
with, until they crank my coffin

1007
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,016
into a coffin-sized hole.

1008
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:04,781
Wow. That was fast.

1009
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:06,833
Love happens, it happens.

1010
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:08,044
Are you shocked?

1011
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:09,324
I'm... I'm... no, I'm happy

1012
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:09,810
for you.

1013
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,676
Thank you.

1014
00:44:10,876 --> 00:44:11,946
Yeah, I really am.

1015
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:14,085
Her name is Charlotte.

1016
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,900
She's fun. She's beautiful.

1017
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:17,850
She's young.

1018
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:18,781
She's amazing.

1019
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,162
And I know she's the one.

1020
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:21,482
I have a way of telling now.

1021
00:44:21,646 --> 00:44:22,653
Oh, really? How?

1022
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:26,082
I've devised a system that
can apply to any couple.

1023
00:44:26,282 --> 00:44:27,337
It goes like this.

1024
00:44:27,537 --> 00:44:29,131
If the relationship can be

1025
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:32,224
summed up in a single sentence,
it will never survive.

1026
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:33,828
I'll give you an example.

1027
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:35,999
The previous relationship, our

1028
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:38,776
single sentence was, "she is the

1029
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,511
lost child to my father figure."

1030
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:43,877
In another one, I was the exotic

1031
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:46,150
aesthete to her
midwestern homebody.

1032
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,870
Exotic aesthete?

1033
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,071
And with another, "she is my

1034
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,421
every sexual fantasy, but she
just wants her bare bottom

1035
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:54,356
spanked."

1036
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:57,852
Right. So, you're saying it
works with you and Charlotte

1037
00:44:58,052 --> 00:45:00,219
because there's not one
sentence that describes you.

1038
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:01,006
Exactly.

1039
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:04,559
And what about you and Matthew?

1040
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,915
I was the carpenter to his

1041
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:10,221
unfixable... fixer-upper.

1042
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,032
"Can't save nobody."

1043
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:14,226
It's a famous saying.

1044
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:16,444
An enormous earthquake hit

1045
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:19,209
kabanjahe, Indonesia,
two days ago.

1046
00:45:19,409 --> 00:45:22,550
There are probably over 500

1047
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,398
animals that have died.

1048
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,739
Most of these animals will,

1049
00:45:26,939 --> 00:45:28,224
unfortunately, go without proper

1050
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:29,458
burial.

1051
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:32,714
We need to aid these souls, help

1052
00:45:32,914 --> 00:45:35,304
them transition into the next

1053
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:37,950
stage of their existence.

1054
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,000
So please remember
today, heart to heart...

1055
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,801
Soul to soul... paw to paw.

1056
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,163
Charlie has told me all about

1057
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:51,598
your search for Matthew Smith.

1058
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:54,745
I was a huge fan of his
in junior high school.

1059
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,548
You know, originally, I

1060
00:45:56,748 --> 00:45:59,289
volunteered to help Ellie find
Matthew because I wanted to have

1061
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:00,556
sex with her.

1062
00:46:00,623 --> 00:46:01,958
Jesus! That's not... that's

1063
00:46:02,592 --> 00:46:02,814
not true.

1064
00:46:03,014 --> 00:46:03,568
It's fine.

1065
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:04,947
I'm not threatened.

1066
00:46:05,147 --> 00:46:05,827
You shouldn't be.

1067
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:08,028
Look at the house.

1068
00:46:08,228 --> 00:46:11,884
Look at how she's
completely made it over.

1069
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:15,685
It's just aglow with love and

1070
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:18,035
warmth and that dream catcher.

1071
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:20,006
She's got a great eye, not

1072
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:22,593
unlike my mother... except, you

1073
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,901
know, Charlotte's
alive and gorgeous.

1074
00:46:25,101 --> 00:46:26,824
That sounds like your sentence.

1075
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,736
Oh, come on.

1076
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:33,334
By the way, what are you and...

1077
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:36,532
LA... lagary... Lucas.
His name is Lucas.

1078
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:37,852
What are you and Lucas doing

1079
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:39,573
I don't know.

1080
00:46:39,773 --> 00:46:41,599
Well, Charlotte and I have

1081
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,796
something wonderful
to celebrate.

1082
00:46:43,996 --> 00:46:46,335
Don't we, my dear?

1083
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:47,368
Celebrate?

1084
00:46:47,568 --> 00:46:53,009
Her lips are like
tiny sugar pillows.

1085
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,902
♪ Endless love ♪

1086
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:59,081
That's lovely.

1087
00:46:59,949 --> 00:47:00,449
Oh, my God.

1088
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:01,276
That thing is huge!

1089
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:02,572
Look at that.

1090
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,907
That is beautiful.

1091
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:05,292
You guys are coming, right?

1092
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,362
Uh... to the wedding?

1093
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:09,116
Yeah. Yeah. When is it?

1094
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:09,996
Next week.

1095
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:10,863
Oh, God.

1096
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:11,925
What? Uh, wow.

1097
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:13,996
That's... it's really great.

1098
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:15,283
That's really kind of...
Exciting.

1099
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:18,089
Well, when you know,
you know, and we know.

1100
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:20,135
So, I'm chartering a jet and

1101
00:47:20,335 --> 00:47:22,963
we're flying over, and
you got to come with us.

1102
00:47:23,163 --> 00:47:23,965
You have a private jet?

1103
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:24,166
Mm-hmm.

1104
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:26,638
Yeah, we'll... we'll fly
on your private jet, sure.

1105
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:28,878
Of course, you know, I've
really been trying to get

1106
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,625
Charlie to enjoy objects more.

1107
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:34,019
I just... I think it would be
good for him, you know, because

1108
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,366
we're in such a golden
era of materialism.

1109
00:47:36,566 --> 00:47:38,781
And we all have a slot to fill

1110
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,490
in the world, and until you

1111
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,743
learn to fill that slot, you're just...
you're fighting against

1112
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:44,769
the natural order.

1113
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,400
You'll never be
completely at peace.

1114
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,054
I've been studying
all about this.

1115
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:48,754
Oh, wow.

1116
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,218
So, there's... there's, like,
papers written on this?

1117
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:52,278
Oh, yeah, tons.

1118
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,804
Are they written in crayon?

1119
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,072
That's really insulting.

1120
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:58,240
No, they're not in crayon.

1121
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,164
Charlie has rich-man's guilt.

1122
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:00,864
I do?

1123
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:01,543
Mm-hmm.

1124
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,001
Even your... your documentary

1125
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:06,941
filmmaking is an effect
of your misalignment.

1126
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:07,224
Right.

1127
00:48:07,424 --> 00:48:10,702
Documentaries... they're
a platform for the poor.

1128
00:48:10,902 --> 00:48:12,557
They should be by poor people,

1129
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,397
for poor people,
about poor people.

1130
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:17,962
You know, I once saw this
little film online, and it was,

1131
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,620
uh, made by a monkeys, about
monkeys, for monkeys.

1132
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,044
That's not true, is it?

1133
00:48:22,244 --> 00:48:25,008
The whole thing's like 10
seconds long, and it's just

1134
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,906
this shaking camera with
occasional glimpses of, like, a

1135
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:29,508
banana and other monkeys.

1136
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,608
And then the camera breaks.

1137
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:35,255
That's... not funny at all.

1138
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,122
That would be animal cruelty.

1139
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:37,822
Right.

1140
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:41,111
It was just a funny little...

1141
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:43,243
It's just a... video.

1142
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,525
The golden age of materialism?

1143
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,387
What?

1144
00:48:45,454 --> 00:48:46,961
She's kind of crazy, right?

1145
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:49,175
Thank you for being nice.

1146
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,455
Yeah. When am I not nice?

1147
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:52,989
You're the one who
can't fake it.

1148
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:55,373
You look really cute tonight.

1149
00:48:55,573 --> 00:48:59,402
Thanks, baby.

1150
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,143
What's going on?

1151
00:49:00,343 --> 00:49:01,438
Are you nervous about your

1152
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:01,921
meeting?

1153
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:02,621
Hmm? No.

1154
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:03,944
You don't need to be.

1155
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:05,264
I mean, he's gonna love you.

1156
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:06,412
No, it's gonna be good.

1157
00:49:06,612 --> 00:49:08,086
Thank you for hooking that up.

1158
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:09,014
Of course.

1159
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:11,120
You don't have to thank me.

1160
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,237
You're up, champ.

1161
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:13,331
Thanks, bud.

1162
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:14,823
Glory hole is stall 3.

1163
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,519
Wow.

1164
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,796
It's exciting, isn't it?

1165
00:49:19,996 --> 00:49:21,257
What?

1166
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:22,461
Love.

1167
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:23,703
Me, Charlotte.

1168
00:49:23,903 --> 00:49:24,861
You, Lucas.

1169
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:28,049
You guys are gonna have a
great time at the wedding.

1170
00:49:28,249 --> 00:49:29,983
And I'm gonna tell Charlotte to

1171
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:32,268
throw the bouquet at you as hard

1172
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:37,305
as she can.

1173
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:38,533
So, what is going on?

1174
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:40,727
What do you got for me?

1175
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:42,359
Well, yeah, it's coming along.

1176
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,437
Ellie, your deadline
is next week.

1177
00:49:44,637 --> 00:49:47,954
Can I just get a little, tiny
progress report, please?

1178
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,866
Okay. Uh, well, if you... if

1179
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:53,387
you have to know, the truth is...
I, uh...

1180
00:49:53,587 --> 00:49:54,827
I'm kind of seeing somebody, so

1181
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,300
my time is... oh,
for God's sake.

1182
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,300
I could give a shit.

1183
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:58,244
Honey, the story.

1184
00:49:58,444 --> 00:49:59,970
What... what's going
on with the story?

1185
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,450
You know, what happened with the

1186
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:02,846
Internet guy?

1187
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,947
What Internet guy?

1188
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:06,919
The guy that I gave $1,000 to

1189
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,636
because he knew
where Matthew was.

1190
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:09,336
That guy.

1191
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:10,118
Oh, yeah.

1192
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:10,908
Uh, that guy.

1193
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,065
Uh... Funny thing.

1194
00:50:13,265 --> 00:50:15,993
People on the Internet... they

1195
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:16,951
aren't always honest.

1196
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,191
Huh.

1197
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,676
And I want to state for the

1198
00:50:19,876 --> 00:50:22,112
record that I had my
doubts from the beginning.

1199
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:23,472
So, what else have you tried?

1200
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:24,428
What do you mean?

1201
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:25,788
Like, have I found Matthew?

1202
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:27,094
Is that what you're asking?

1203
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:28,772
'Cause, I mean, you said it...

1204
00:50:28,972 --> 00:50:30,650
He may not even be out there.

1205
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,468
Did our conversation just
have no effect on you

1206
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:34,463
whatsoever?

1207
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:36,900
Because here's the deal, honey.

1208
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,150
I just... I cannot cover for you

1209
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,327
anymore while you self-destruct

1210
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:44,035
over some idiot
fucking musician.

1211
00:50:44,235 --> 00:50:48,041
My magazine is on the line here.

1212
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:49,983
Okay, I need you to do three

1213
00:50:50,183 --> 00:50:51,742
things, all right?

1214
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:53,964
Get your shit together.

1215
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:55,175
Find Matthew.

1216
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:58,510
Write a very good
story about it.

1217
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,291
Or what?

1218
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,288
You'll fire me?

1219
00:51:03,488 --> 00:51:20,677
That's right.

1220
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:25,678
Hey. Come on in.

1221
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,251
I was just running.

1222
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:29,055
Really weird.

1223
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:29,755
It was good.

1224
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,399
The meeting was
really, really...

1225
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,288
Oh, God, yeah. What happened?

1226
00:51:33,488 --> 00:51:36,015
I think, uh... I think I'm flying to L.A.
tomorrow, yeah.

1227
00:51:36,215 --> 00:51:36,772
Oh, my God.

1228
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:38,515
And they want to set up a

1229
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:40,391
bunch of meetings and
shows and, uh...

1230
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:42,282
Wow! Ahh! That's amazing!

1231
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:42,982
Crazy!

1232
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,890
I cannot believe it.

1233
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,082
Wow. Wait.

1234
00:51:46,282 --> 00:51:47,765
Uh, when... when
will you be back?

1235
00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:50,281
Uh... I don't know.

1236
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:52,096
Oh, um... Charlie's wedding.

1237
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:52,796
Yeah.

1238
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:54,050
What... what day is it?

1239
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:54,751
Saturday.

1240
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:56,111
But he's gonna fly us over on

1241
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:56,889
Friday.

1242
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:58,021
So, that's fine.

1243
00:51:58,221 --> 00:52:01,050
I'll just fly in and
meet you Saturday.

1244
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:02,552
Okay.

1245
00:52:02,592 --> 00:52:03,952
Yeah. What was that?

1246
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:05,822
What?

1247
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,766
What was that?

1248
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:09,466
I'm gonna make the wedding.

1249
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:10,197
I know.

1250
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:10,922
I am.

1251
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:12,594
And I'm gonna call you every

1252
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:13,233
day.

1253
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:14,124
Okay.

1254
00:52:14,324 --> 00:52:16,069
Name a day, any day.

1255
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:16,769
Monday.

1256
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,337
I'm gonna call you Monday.

1257
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:19,260
Name another day.

1258
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,046
Thursday.

1259
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:21,366
Yeah, Thursday's bad for me.

1260
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:22,338
Fuck you!

1261
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:25,443
I'm gonna call you Thursday.

1262
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:28,652
I'm glad we're back to work

1263
00:52:28,852 --> 00:52:31,381
on the, uh, documentary.

1264
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,242
Nice to have the distraction.

1265
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,602
What's the latest on the, uh,

1266
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:36,452
wunderkind?

1267
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:37,844
I figured it out.

1268
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:41,325
I am the industry-wise
transition girlfriend to his

1269
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,375
soon-to-be model-fucking
teen heartthrob.

1270
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:47,751
Ooh. Your sentence.

1271
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:48,968
I'm sorry.

1272
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:51,608
This is, uh... well, this is the
house where Matthew grew up.

1273
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:53,202
Who do you think lives there

1274
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:53,882
now?

1275
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:55,561
Apparently, nobody.

1276
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:58,611
I mean, no one answered
when I knocked.

1277
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,943
I know how to break
into his room.

1278
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:03,603
Done that before.

1279
00:53:03,803 --> 00:53:07,637
This used to be easier.

1280
00:53:07,837 --> 00:53:11,920
There is a door here...
That's unlocked.

1281
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:16,025
Let's just... let's
go in this door.

1282
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,244
It's exactly as I remember it.

1283
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:23,256
It even smells the same.

1284
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:26,749
Luckily, for the documentary,

1285
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:32,975
I don't have smell-o-vision.

1286
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,689
This is where I
lost my virginity.

1287
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:37,045
Maybe that shouldn't go on

1288
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:38,347
record.

1289
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,121
Oh, no. That's great.

1290
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:42,456
That's just the kind of, uh,

1291
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:44,559
detail we're looking for in

1292
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:46,722
hard-hitting documentary
filmmaking.

1293
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:47,945
How was it?

1294
00:53:48,145 --> 00:53:51,857
Eh. What do you expect
for the first time?

1295
00:53:52,057 --> 00:53:52,996
How was yours?

1296
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:53,937
Oh, man.

1297
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:56,922
I lost my virginity
about 200 or 300 times.

1298
00:53:57,122 --> 00:53:59,693
Uh... just answer the question.

1299
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:00,567
All right.

1300
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,697
If you must know, I was 14.

1301
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:05,541
It was our 46-year-old
Jamaican housekeeper.

1302
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:06,437
What?!

1303
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:08,244
She was very tender.

1304
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:10,479
She had a lot of moles.

1305
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,528
Okay, thank you.

1306
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:15,260
Hey, I'm gonna leave you and

1307
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,623
the ghost of Matthew
alone for a second.

1308
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:20,822
I got to pee.

1309
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:34,895
Holy shit.

1310
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:37,580
I don't know he had these.

1311
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,119
Hey, I just found a bunch
of issues of<i> stax.</i>

1312
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,509
<i>I think he was a subscriber from</i> I think
he was a subscriber from way back.

1313
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:47,170
His mom must have... shit.

1314
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,449
Ellie?

1315
00:54:50,649 --> 00:54:51,576
Mr. Smith.

1316
00:54:51,776 --> 00:54:53,685
What are you doing in my house?

1317
00:54:53,885 --> 00:54:57,296
Uh, I just... I-I knocked on the
door, and there... there was

1318
00:54:57,496 --> 00:54:59,376
no answer, so I...
So you broke in.

1319
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:02,565
Well, I thought you
might have moved or...

1320
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,538
Oh, for the love of God.

1321
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:09,438
Check it out... potty cam.

1322
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:10,760
Who the hell is this?

1323
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,275
This is, um... this is

1324
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,243
Charlie.

1325
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,631
He and I are making a
documentary together.

1326
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:17,391
A documentary?

1327
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:18,414
Oh. On that?

1328
00:55:18,535 --> 00:55:21,264
This is cutting-edge
Japanese technology, sir.

1329
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:23,543
I am... I am so
sorry we broke in.

1330
00:55:23,743 --> 00:55:25,088
Obviously, it was a very stupid

1331
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:26,130
idea.

1332
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,221
I just want to apologize again.

1333
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:33,474
I mean, it must be unpleasant to

1334
00:55:33,674 --> 00:55:37,852
be reminded of everything.

1335
00:55:38,052 --> 00:55:38,754
Yeah.

1336
00:55:38,954 --> 00:55:42,619
You guys know the way.

1337
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:43,519
Yes.

1338
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:46,184
And you have a beautiful home.

1339
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:51,013
It's really lovely.

1340
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:52,207
He always hated me.

1341
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:53,084
Really? Why?

1342
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:54,604
Yeah. I don't know.

1343
00:55:54,804 --> 00:55:57,796
He... he didn't want Matthew
to be famous, and I think he

1344
00:55:57,996 --> 00:56:01,444
thought I encouraged Matthew
too much with his music.

1345
00:56:01,644 --> 00:56:04,092
He held me responsible when...

1346
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:06,107
He rebelled and left home and,

1347
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:08,764
eventually, when he...

1348
00:56:13,902 --> 00:56:15,070
Would you come back with me

1349
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:16,405
to my house?

1350
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,810
I have something for the wedding

1351
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:18,917
being delivered.

1352
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:19,942
Ooh! Your tux?

1353
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:21,193
No.

1354
00:56:21,393 --> 00:56:22,787
The ring?

1355
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:23,487
No.

1356
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,493
What? Cake?

1357
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:26,239
No.

1358
00:56:26,439 --> 00:56:27,783
Lingerie?

1359
00:56:27,983 --> 00:56:28,553
No.

1360
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,452
What is it?

1361
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:32,218
$2,400. It's all there.

1362
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:35,049
Is it one of those things
you can't get water on?

1363
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:36,830
Uh, it's galagos bush baby.

1364
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,465
He's endangered, though, right?

1365
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:40,638
'Cause that's the
more expensive one?

1366
00:56:40,838 --> 00:56:43,543
Yeah, it's a girl,
actually, but, yes.

1367
00:56:43,743 --> 00:56:46,008
Does she get lonely in there?

1368
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:47,527
Galagos is not puppies.

1369
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:49,639
They don't want love.

1370
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,181
They just want to be left alone.

1371
00:56:53,381 --> 00:57:06,955
Lucky them.

1372
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,557
Oh, Lucas, it's, uh...

1373
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:14,202
You-know-who calling you

1374
00:57:14,402 --> 00:57:17,840
again... and again and again.

1375
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,348
Uh... just call me.

1376
00:57:21,548 --> 00:57:27,710
When do you start serving?

1377
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,580
Good. Come in.

1378
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,981
Oh, you look so nice.

1379
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:33,114
Thank you.

1380
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,099
You look quite elegant yourself.

1381
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:36,835
Oh, yeah, that's me.

1382
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:38,609
Have a seat.

1383
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:41,385
What's happening?

1384
00:57:41,585 --> 00:57:44,189
Oh. I just needed to talk

1385
00:57:44,389 --> 00:57:47,140
about something before I
actually go through with this.

1386
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,161
I'm not a religious guy, so I

1387
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:52,034
hope you don't mind sitting
in for my confession.

1388
00:57:52,234 --> 00:57:52,996
I'd be honored.

1389
00:57:53,196 --> 00:57:54,194
It's dark and sordid.

1390
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:54,894
Really?

1391
00:57:55,037 --> 00:57:55,957
No, not at all.

1392
00:57:56,157 --> 00:57:57,136
I'm excited.

1393
00:57:57,336 --> 00:57:59,981
You know, after I got

1394
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:03,111
divorced, I went through...

1395
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:06,052
A period of... failed
relationships.

1396
00:58:06,252 --> 00:58:08,964
And now, recently, I see you and

1397
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:12,026
Lucas, realize that something's
missing in my life.

1398
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:14,134
So I did something out

1399
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:20,555
character, something
I'd never done before.

1400
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:23,791
I called an escort service.

1401
00:58:23,991 --> 00:58:25,151
You'd never done that before?

1402
00:58:25,289 --> 00:58:25,789
No, no.

1403
00:58:25,901 --> 00:58:28,927
I was always too afraid that
something would go wrong.

1404
00:58:29,127 --> 00:58:31,093
Worry about diseases or...
Of course.

1405
00:58:31,293 --> 00:58:32,524
They're everywhere.

1406
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,729
No, it was more the
protocol of it all.

1407
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:37,081
If you don't take up all your

1408
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:40,536
time, do you get to snuggle
for the rest of the hour?

1409
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:43,103
Or if you need more
time, do you pay extra?

1410
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:44,915
If you run over, is there a

1411
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:47,489
bell, and they just
shove you off of them?

1412
00:58:47,556 --> 00:58:48,289
There's a bell?

1413
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:50,800
As it turns out, there was

1414
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,888
not a bell, which was a relief.

1415
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:54,297
But one night...

1416
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,276
...there was a knock at the

1417
00:58:56,476 --> 00:58:58,913
door, and I opened it.

1418
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:03,216
And... and there
stood Charlotte.

1419
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:03,916
Wow.

1420
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:06,412
I thought she was a socialite.

1421
00:59:06,612 --> 00:59:07,652
Like, all the charity work

1422
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,000
and... she loves animals.

1423
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,471
She has a big heart.

1424
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:14,051
She wasn't cut out
for that life.

1425
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,391
She said that I was her first

1426
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:17,830
client as a prostitute.

1427
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,015
I'm not naive, but... yeah.

1428
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:24,890
Anyway, I love her.

1429
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,147
And, uh... I'm gonna marry her.

1430
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:30,585
I don't know, Ellie.

1431
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:32,701
I know I'm not a deep guy, but

1432
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:35,057
I'm not a shallow guy, either.

1433
00:59:35,257 --> 00:59:37,212
Eh, what can I say?

1434
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:39,942
Life's pretty weird.

1435
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:41,889
I got to agree.

1436
00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:44,263
So, here before your family

1437
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:46,467
and friends and everyone who

1438
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,937
knows you best, I pronounce

1439
00:59:49,137 --> 00:59:50,624
you husband and wife.

1440
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:53,054
You may kiss the each other.

1441
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:03,565
Where's Lucas?

1442
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:06,516
I haven't heard from
him in two days.

1443
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:08,571
Well, just pick somebody out.

1444
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,706
There's a lot of guys here, a
lot of available man cake.

1445
01:00:11,773 --> 01:00:13,179
You can do a lot of damage

1446
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:15,394
with some of these guys.

1447
01:00:15,594 --> 01:00:16,381
Charlie.

1448
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:19,280
Come on. Piece of man cake.

1449
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:20,662
You see that big hunk of

1450
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:23,022
rock 'n' roll man back there?

1451
01:00:23,222 --> 01:00:25,531
Are you calling him rock 'n'
roll because of his hair?

1452
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:27,950
No, seriously, that's
my buddy Craig.

1453
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,125
He's a good guy.

1454
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:30,493
I'll hook it up.

1455
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:31,982
No. Charlie, no.

1456
01:00:32,182 --> 01:00:32,905
Why not?

1457
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:34,481
He's a good guy.

1458
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:35,806
You and Craig.

1459
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:37,058
Charlie, no.

1460
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,401
You and Craig.

1461
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,868
You and Craig!

1462
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:42,698
Yes, I have the jaw
of a superhero.

1463
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:46,087
Yes, I could light up a
dark room with my smile.

1464
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:48,727
Yes, I have the hair
of an '80s rock star.

1465
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:52,073
But this... this is what
I'm really proud of.

1466
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,309
This is God-given.

1467
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:56,574
I can't do anything about this,
but this, I feel, is... is

1468
01:00:56,774 --> 01:01:00,051
something that I've... I've earned
through hard work and determination.

1469
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:02,851
And I'll tell you something else
that I think is going to impress

1470
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,212
you.

1471
01:01:03,412 --> 01:01:04,933
What is that?

1472
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:07,809
I am 14 credits away from an

1473
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:09,878
online degree... from the

1474
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:11,757
university of Phoenix no less...

1475
01:01:11,957 --> 01:01:12,677
To be a therapist.

1476
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:13,196
Wow.

1477
01:01:13,396 --> 01:01:16,427
A licensed,
accredited therapist.

1478
01:01:16,627 --> 01:01:19,307
Okay. I am gonna let you give
me a free like five-minute

1479
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:20,529
consultation.

1480
01:01:20,664 --> 01:01:21,609
How do you feel about that?

1481
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:22,210
Oh, yeah.

1482
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:24,884
Okay, so, I have this

1483
01:01:25,084 --> 01:01:27,608
boyfriend... or maybe<i> had.</i>

1484
01:01:27,808 --> 01:01:29,338
And, uh, well, he was supposed

1485
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,219
to meet me here.

1486
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:33,047
But I think the gig is up.

1487
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:34,306
Ah! See?

1488
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:37,356
Now, why do you call it a gig?

1489
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,094
See, gig is a very
temporary term.

1490
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:41,319
It's very, uh, transient.

1491
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:43,389
It's here today, gone tomorrow.

1492
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:45,287
I think that you get on that

1493
01:01:45,487 --> 01:01:47,468
stage knowing that you're going

1494
01:01:47,668 --> 01:01:49,498
to get off that stage quickly.

1495
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:53,205
Quickly, like maybe after a

1496
01:01:53,405 --> 01:01:56,472
couple of songs, hmm?

1497
01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,984
Are we, uh... are
they still serving?

1498
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:03,904
I mean, either whiskey or cake

1499
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:06,735
or... something sweet.

1500
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:08,757
Oh, here we go.

1501
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,719
Charlie, what is this?

1502
01:02:10,919 --> 01:02:13,210
Well, Charlotte, it's

1503
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,515
something that I know you've
always wanted and thought you

1504
01:02:16,715 --> 01:02:19,191
would never, ever get
in this lifetime.

1505
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,056
From the galapagos islands in

1506
01:02:21,256 --> 01:02:23,304
the South pacific...

1507
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:26,971
It's so beautiful!

1508
01:02:27,171 --> 01:02:33,068
Oh, God. Is it dead?

1509
01:02:33,268 --> 01:02:35,985
Oh.

1510
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:47,462
Oh, shit.

1511
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,266
Hey. Surprise.

1512
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,494
What are you doing here?

1513
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:56,720
Uh... this... this was our

1514
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,007
plan... I thought.

1515
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,475
You didn't... you
didn't even show.

1516
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:05,490
You didn't call me back.

1517
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:09,930
Yeah, well, I got held up.

1518
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:11,290
Well, some of us know some of

1519
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:12,887
us.

1520
01:03:12,954 --> 01:03:15,153
Um, who is this?

1521
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:22,205
He's sort of my... therapist.

1522
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:23,046
Great.

1523
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:24,934
You two should probably talk.

1524
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:26,367
No, no, no.

1525
01:03:26,388 --> 01:03:27,604
You stay right there.

1526
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,384
I mean, what could possibly be

1527
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:32,918
said that could make this any

1528
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:36,482
better, you know?

1529
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:40,949
Yeah, all right.

1530
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:45,334
So, I should stay?

1531
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:49,992
No.

1532
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:09,900
Well, I heard about you and

1533
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,095
Lucas... and Craig.

1534
01:04:13,295 --> 01:04:14,977
I don't even want
to talk about it.

1535
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:16,288
Look on the bright side.

1536
01:04:16,488 --> 01:04:17,728
At least you didn't give a dead

1537
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,576
animal to somebody on
their wedding day.

1538
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:22,661
Guilty.

1539
01:04:22,861 --> 01:04:24,326
Come on.

1540
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:25,132
It's a new day.

1541
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:27,304
You know what you need to do.

1542
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:28,624
You need to go back to work.

1543
01:04:28,753 --> 01:04:31,989
Need to get started looking for
Matthew again, get back in the rv.

1544
01:04:32,189 --> 01:04:33,808
Or, you know what?

1545
01:04:34,008 --> 01:04:35,819
Just take a trip somewhere.

1546
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:36,603
It's on me.

1547
01:04:36,803 --> 01:04:37,740
How about that?

1548
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,351
Charlie... that's
fucking ridiculous.

1549
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:41,631
I'm just trying to help you

1550
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:42,146
out.

1551
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,073
I know you feel bad about last

1552
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:47,074
night, and I'm... I just
want to be your friend.

1553
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:48,408
You're only my friend 'cause

1554
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:57,225
you had a thousand bucks
when I needed it.

1555
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,554
I didn't mean that.

1556
01:04:58,754 --> 01:05:01,606
Came out the wrong way.

1557
01:05:01,806 --> 01:05:03,852
Did it?

1558
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:34,812
Charlie... oh, fuck.
Charlie... pbht.

1559
01:05:35,012 --> 01:05:40,099
"Ellie, I think we could have

1560
01:05:40,299 --> 01:05:43,334
been something special,
but what's done is done.

1561
01:05:43,534 --> 01:05:46,252
Here's the money you wouldn't

1562
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:48,363
let me return."

1563
01:05:48,563 --> 01:05:49,619
Holy shit.

1564
01:05:49,819 --> 01:05:51,146
"It paid for my demo, so thank

1565
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:51,885
you.

1566
01:05:52,085 --> 01:05:53,150
Take care.

1567
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:55,617
Lucas."

1568
01:05:55,684 --> 01:05:57,554
Ellie, your deadline came and

1569
01:05:57,754 --> 01:05:59,323
went weeks ago.

1570
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:02,072
You know, this business,
it's fickle enough.

1571
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:05,429
I would be absolutely justified
never publishing another word

1572
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,965
from you, based on the way

1573
01:06:07,165 --> 01:06:09,898

Yeah.

1591
01:08:19,427 --> 01:08:19,560
Yeah.

1592
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,400
No, this is what I
was worried about.

1593
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,032
What?

1594
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:26,033
No guy, just you wallowing.

1595
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:27,895
I'm working!

1596
01:08:28,095 --> 01:08:30,071
I was getting so close
to figuring this out.

1597
01:08:30,271 --> 01:08:31,231
Okay, what is this shit?

1598
01:08:31,426 --> 01:08:31,926
This song.

1599
01:08:32,107 --> 01:08:33,019
It's Matthew. It is.

1600
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:35,259
And he's singing... singing about me...
I mean, us.

1601
01:08:35,435 --> 01:08:36,267
Listen.

1602

♪ I'll be sailing on your... ♪

1603
01:08:39,678 --> 01:08:42,149
I tracked the I.P. Address
where this e-mail came from,

1604
01:08:42,349 --> 01:08:44,789
when the guy sent me this, but
it's just some fucking library

1605
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:45,246
computer.

1606
01:08:45,446 --> 01:08:46,484
And I just... ugh!

1607
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:49,725
I know that I'm just not
thinking of something.

1608
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,424
I mean, he's out there, singing

1609
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:55,663
about me, wanting
me to find him.

1610
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:59,136
Okay, but, Ellie, don't you
think he'd just call you?

1611
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:00,402
Him?

1612
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,069
No.

1613
01:09:02,136 --> 01:09:07,242
God. He was such a dick.

1614
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:11,272
Hey, listen... don't...
Fuck you.

1615
01:09:11,472 --> 01:09:12,513
Oh, wait. Fuck me?

1616
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:13,529
Yeah, fuck you.

1617
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,270
Oh, all right, cool.

1618
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,158
Um, listen... you need to stop

1619
01:09:18,358 --> 01:09:19,020
this shit, okay?

1620
01:09:19,921 --> 01:09:20,421
Excuse me.

1621
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:21,756
Hey. I am working.

1622
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:23,358
Okay, it's not work, all right?

1623
01:09:23,558 --> 01:09:25,797
You're in crazy town!

1624
01:09:25,997 --> 01:09:26,720
Listen to me.

1625
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:27,420
Listen!

1626
01:09:27,575 --> 01:09:30,131
All right, you
have to stop this.

1627
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:31,008
Okay.

1628
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:33,504
Please, please, please let go,

1629
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:35,701
please let go, please let go!

1630
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,442
I want you to look at him...

1631
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:39,568
Okay?... and remember him for

1632
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:41,851
the shithead that he was.

1633
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,744
Is!

1634
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:54,755
Was/is.

1635
01:09:54,756 --> 01:09:56,759
Holy shit.

1636
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,223
Yeah.

1637
01:09:58,423 --> 01:09:59,995
Holy fucking shit.

1638
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:00,996
Yeah, tough stuff.

1639
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:01,828
I love you.

1640
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:03,459
I love you, too.

1641
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:04,949
Oh, my God.

1642
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:13,908
Wait. What?

1643
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:56,384
Oh, God.

1644
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,286
Where's Charlotte?

1645
01:10:58,486 --> 01:11:07,060
Have a seat.

1646
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:09,203
Before you apologize... and I

1647
01:11:09,403 --> 01:11:12,067
assume that's why you're here...

1648
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,697
I have something I'd
like to say to you.

1649
01:11:14,897 --> 01:11:15,619
Okay.

1650
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:17,819
I only had good
intentions toward you.

1651
01:11:18,019 --> 01:11:20,650
I didn't deserve to be treated
the way I was treated.

1652
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:21,854
I know, I know.

1653
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:24,192
I... I was totally out of line.

1654
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:25,881
Sometimes I can be a jackass.

1655
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:26,723
Mm. Yeah.

1656
01:11:26,923 --> 01:11:29,203
I wasn't necessarily asking

1657
01:11:29,403 --> 01:11:30,643
you to agree with that specific

1658
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:31,487
point.

1659
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,831
I am really sorry, Charlie.

1660
01:11:35,031 --> 01:11:35,838
Really sorry.

1661
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,315
Thank you.

1662
01:11:37,515 --> 01:11:39,241
I believe you.

1663
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:41,024
So, you asked about Charlotte.

1664
01:11:41,224 --> 01:11:41,724
Yeah.

1665
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:44,341
Yeah, well, Charlotte
and I are done.

1666
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:46,000
Wow. What happened?

1667
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,469
We had some issues.

1668
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:49,259
What kind of issues?

1669
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:50,825
You know, "issues."

1670
01:11:51,025 --> 01:11:52,152
You couldn't get it up?

1671
01:11:52,352 --> 01:11:54,375
Why is that always
the assumption?

1672
01:11:54,575 --> 01:11:55,075
No.

1673
01:11:55,233 --> 01:11:57,018
I could get it up.

1674
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:59,525
But there were some
bigger issues.

1675
01:11:59,725 --> 01:12:00,758
Like what?

1676
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,568
That she was already married.

1677
01:12:03,768 --> 01:12:04,268
No.

1678
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:05,988
Yeah.

1679
01:12:06,188 --> 01:12:07,380
Wow.

1680
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:10,824
I don't know... what to say.

1681
01:12:11,024 --> 01:12:12,583
There's no logic to love.

1682
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:14,980
It's just a painful, brutal

1683
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,669
process of trial and error.

1684
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:20,687
And you just go through it again

1685
01:12:20,887 --> 01:12:23,638
and again and again.

1686
01:12:23,838 --> 01:12:27,557
And again and again and again.

1687
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:28,551
And again.

1688
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:32,091
Well, I think I might have something...
that will take your

1689
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,926
mind off Charlotte for a
little while, at least.

1690
01:12:35,126 --> 01:12:36,585
Okay.

1691
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,436
Think I've... I
really found him.

1692
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:42,780
"Him"?

1693
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:43,958
Matthew.

1694
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:44,961
Matthew?

1695
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,194
Really?

1696
01:12:46,394 --> 01:12:50,245
Mm-hmm. I've rented a car.

1697
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:55,566
And I would very much
appreciate your help.

1698
01:12:55,766 --> 01:13:01,576
I'm ready to hit the road again.

1699
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,903
Okay. Remember in Matthew's
house, he had all these back

1700
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:05,703
issues of<i> stax?</i>

1701
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,080
Mm.

1702
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,523
Right? So, according to the subscriber
database, it's never been dropped.

1703
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:11,453
Just the address was
changed to the bar.

1704
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:14,401
So, his mom got him the
subscription back in high

1705
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:16,102
school, but I think he's just

1706
01:13:16,302 --> 01:13:18,313
kept it in her name
all this time.

1707
01:13:18,513 --> 01:13:19,805
Mm. Huh.

1708
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:20,696
This is good.

1709
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,376
This is good investigative
journalism.

1710
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:23,140
Good.

1711
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,166
Why, thank you.

1712
01:13:25,366 --> 01:13:27,170
You're welcome.

1713
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,804
Check these out.

1714
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,213
Got them on an online spy store.

1715
01:13:31,413 --> 01:13:31,913
See?

1716
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:35,019
A camera and a microphone.

1717
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:38,414
And no matter what I look at,
you can see it on the screen.

1718
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:39,732
Like, look.

1719
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:46,622
Gonna pan right...
And then pan left.

1720
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:47,782
Stop looking at my tits.

1721
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:48,097
Okay.

1722
01:13:48,297 --> 01:13:49,897
I just happened to be
looking over there.

1723
01:13:50,028 --> 01:13:52,993
I was... I like your scarf.

1724
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,612
How is it you don't like music?

1725
01:13:54,812 --> 01:13:57,819
It's not so much that
I don't like music.

1726
01:13:58,019 --> 01:14:00,457
Um... it's just
hard to find a song

1727
01:14:00,657 --> 01:14:02,113
that doesn't annoy me.

1728
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,088
Well, what do you like?

1729
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:06,585
I remember liking a
Canadian artist.

1730
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:07,345
Leonard Cohen?

1731
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:07,900
No.

1732
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,137
Neil young?

1733
01:14:09,337 --> 01:14:09,621
No.

1734
01:14:09,821 --> 01:14:10,909
Rufus Wainwright?

1735
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:11,347
No.

1736
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,969
Okay. So, listen, when we're finished
with all this, you should come over to my

1737
01:14:15,169 --> 01:14:16,178
apartment, and I'll... I'll play

1738
01:14:16,378 --> 01:14:18,853
you some stuff. I'll...
Bryan Adams.

1739
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:19,970
Bryan Adams.

1740
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,193
I remember, on the album cover,

1741
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:24,580
he's doing this... this pose,

1742
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,779
like a guy... like, running
across the street.

1743
01:14:27,979 --> 01:14:29,331
I thought that was kind of cool.

1744
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:30,335
Mm. Mm.

1745
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:34,147
Well, that's it. That's a start.

1746
01:14:34,347 --> 01:14:34,847
Wait.

1747
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:37,452
Someone's going in.

1748
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:39,904
Oh, yeah, it's the bartender.

1749
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:40,624
Should we go?

1750
01:14:40,728 --> 01:14:43,210
No, no, no. Just give her...

1751
01:14:43,410 --> 01:14:45,780
Give her a few minutes.

1752
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,016
I have been thinking,
what was our sentence?

1753
01:14:49,784 --> 01:14:49,873
Hmm?

1754
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:52,535
What was our sentence
when we were dating?

1755
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:53,935
I know... two dates doesn't...

1756
01:14:54,014 --> 01:14:58,403
It doesn't really count
as dating anyway.

1757
01:14:58,603 --> 01:15:00,285
Anyway, let's go.

1758
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:01,325
We should probably...

1759
01:15:03,364 --> 01:15:03,556
First?

1760
01:15:03,756 --> 01:15:04,775
I think you should.

1761
01:15:04,975 --> 01:15:07,095
And, you know, settle in,
and then I'll wander in.

1762
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,777
She won't know we're together.

1763
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:10,233
Okay. All right.

1764
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:12,535
Remember, I'm filming.

1765
01:15:12,735 --> 01:15:20,082
How could I forget?

1766
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,067
Hi.

1767
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,351
What can I get you?

1768
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:26,804
Could I get a clean glass, a

1769
01:15:27,004 --> 01:15:31,810
bottle of water, and a
whole lime, please?

1770
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,845
A whole lime?

1771
01:15:34,045 --> 01:15:53,849
Please.

1772
01:15:59,887 --> 01:16:00,049
Hey.

1773
01:16:00,249 --> 01:16:02,431
I'm actually looking
for someone.

1774
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,886
I was hoping you could help me.

1775
01:16:05,086 --> 01:16:07,545
His name's Matthew...
Matthew Smith.

1776
01:16:07,745 --> 01:16:08,656
Matthew Smith?

1777
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:09,493
Mm-hmm.

1778
01:16:09,693 --> 01:16:11,188
Matthew Smith...

1779
01:16:11,388 --> 01:16:13,246
Isn't that the dude that killed

1780
01:16:13,446 --> 01:16:15,691
himself over at the falls?

1781
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:18,374
Well, I mean... yeah, but...
He...

1782
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,929
I was told, you know, he used to

1783
01:16:20,129 --> 01:16:23,794
play here a lot and...
Probably. I...

1784
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:25,729
I don't know.

1785
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:26,429
Sorry.

1786
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:26,865
Okay.

1787
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:29,857
No, no. Thanks.

1788
01:16:30,057 --> 01:16:34,689
Thanks anyway.

1789
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,937
Hey.

1790
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:52,854
Yeah.

1791
01:16:53,054 --> 01:16:57,479
I'm just gonna mosey along.

1792
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,662
There she is.

1793
01:17:23,862 --> 01:17:37,184
Let's go.

1794
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,974
You're really good at this.

1795
01:17:58,974 --> 01:17:59,974
You know that last night,

1796
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,991
when they found his
car out by the falls?

1797
01:18:03,191 --> 01:18:06,588
I fucking... I just drove
out there like a maniac.

1798
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:09,033
And I stood there with the cops,

1799
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:10,299
just waiting.

1800
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:15,424
I feel like that's
what I'm still doing.

1801
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,904
So... should we wait
a little longer?

1802
01:18:19,104 --> 01:18:21,473
Just until the morning?

1803
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:25,001
Yeah, it's much better to
confront the demons of your past

1804
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,192
in the harsh, unforgiving light

1805
01:18:27,392 --> 01:18:29,032
of early dawn.

1806
01:18:29,232 --> 01:18:30,019
Yeah.

1807
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:32,786
Definitely.

1808
01:18:32,986 --> 01:18:35,343
Yeah.

1809
01:18:35,543 --> 01:18:41,734
So... we have this item.

1810
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:45,337
This is an ancient weapon,

1811
01:18:45,537 --> 01:18:48,606
purely designed to protect you
from the detritus of your

1812
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:50,291
relationships past.

1813
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,106
It's a powerful weapon.

1814
01:18:52,306 --> 01:18:55,992
Do you require a demonstration?

1815
01:18:56,192 --> 01:18:59,664
So... mm. Mm!

1816
01:18:59,864 --> 01:19:00,857
Mmmm!

1817
01:19:01,057 --> 01:19:04,045
It makes your face light up like

1818
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:06,062
Satan's concubine.

1819
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:09,110
You are so weird.

1820
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:35,412
Ellie.

1821
01:19:35,612 --> 01:19:40,848
Ellie, wake up.

1822
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:45,946
Is that Matthew?

1823
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,319
Is that him?

1824
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,283
I can't tell.

1825
01:19:54,483 --> 01:19:58,718
What do you want to do?

1826
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:02,963
Do you want to go?

1827
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:07,769
No.

1828
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:14,341
This is... this is weird now.

1829
01:20:14,408 --> 01:20:16,553
Are you okay?

1830
01:20:16,753 --> 01:20:18,479
Yeah.

1831
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:46,140
Yeah.

1832
01:21:04,859 --> 01:21:06,537
Well...

1833
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,409
Please turn the camera off.

1834
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:24,783
Thank you.

1835
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:37,057
Hi.

1836
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:44,865
What... oh, God.

1837
01:21:44,932 --> 01:21:57,112
I... I don't even...

1838
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:07,153
Hey, Matthew, we're gonna go...
Oh.

1839
01:22:07,154 --> 01:22:12,957
Sara, this is Ellie.

1840
01:22:13,157 --> 01:22:14,553
Hi.

1841
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:17,294
Hey, there.

1842
01:22:17,494 --> 01:22:26,005
I'm Charlie.

1843
01:22:26,006 --> 01:22:34,529
I, uh... I saw your dad.

1844
01:22:34,729 --> 01:22:36,443
Wow.

1845
01:22:36,643 --> 01:22:38,438
Yeah.

1846
01:22:38,638 --> 01:22:44,373
I haven't seen him in
a long, long time.

1847
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:49,753
I don't think he was
very happy to see me.

1848
01:22:49,953 --> 01:22:52,770
He's not very happy.

1849
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,994
I heard your... your new song.

1850
01:22:55,194 --> 01:22:56,240
Heard the new song?

1851
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,493
Yeah, you played at a bar

1852
01:22:58,693 --> 01:23:01,421
around here somewhere.

1853
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:02,189
No.

1854
01:23:02,389 --> 01:23:14,087
No new songs.

1855
01:23:14,088 --> 01:23:15,327
You look great, kid.

1856
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,810
So, do you guys... want to

1857
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:25,919
come in for coffee or something?

1858
01:23:26,119 --> 01:23:29,646
I would really enjoy
some delicious coffee.

1859
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:31,258
Thank you.

1860
01:23:31,458 --> 01:23:33,214
We can't stay.

1861
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:36,365
We can't stay, actually.

1862
01:23:36,565 --> 01:23:46,752
It's really nice to meet you.

1863
01:23:46,753 --> 01:23:48,378
Bye, Matthew.

1864
01:24:11,378 --> 01:24:14,102
We can go to the park.

1865
01:24:14,302 --> 01:24:17,186
Yeah? Yeah? Yes?

1866
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,317
You all right?

1867
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:20,256
Yeah.

1868
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:22,343
Talk about it in a sec.

1869
01:24:22,543 --> 01:24:23,502
Yeah, yeah.

1870
01:24:23,702 --> 01:24:51,652
Yeah, you're heavy.

1871

You may want to hang on to this.

1872

Everything's still
in it that I shot.

We all have someone
like Matthew Smith.

1880
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,485
We spend thousands of hours

1881
01:25:37,685 --> 01:25:39,503
wondering, imagining, and

1882
01:25:39,703 --> 01:25:41,638
re-creating our time with them.

1883
01:25:41,838 --> 01:25:44,116
We look backwards to
avoid going forwards.

1884
01:25:44,316 --> 01:25:45,928
But at a certain point, it's

1885
01:25:46,128 --> 01:25:48,811
time to stop singing that old

1886
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,860
song and write a new tune.

1887
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,786
I'd be... pretty
embarrassed to walk in

1888
01:25:54,986 --> 01:25:56,120
here if I were you.

1889
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,288
Your deadline?

1890
01:25:57,488 --> 01:25:59,170
It came and went weeks ago.

1891
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:02,853
I had to push a total piece-of-shit
story to the cover because of you.

1892
01:26:03,053 --> 01:26:04,485
I need people I can
rely on, Ellie.

1893
01:26:04,685 --> 01:26:07,799
This business is fickle enough.

1894
01:26:07,999 --> 01:26:09,781
I mean, your story, it's...
It was okay.

1895
01:26:09,981 --> 01:26:11,285
It was pretty good.

1896
01:26:11,485 --> 01:26:12,795
It's good.

1897
01:26:12,995 --> 01:26:17,117
You know, it's very good.

1898
01:26:17,317 --> 01:26:20,391
I recognize this... this chick.

1899
01:26:20,591 --> 01:26:22,877
Are you sure you want to reveal
this much about yourself?

1900
01:26:23,077 --> 01:26:24,615
It's just as much about your

1901
01:26:24,815 --> 01:26:26,328
defects as it is about Matthew.

1902
01:26:26,528 --> 01:26:28,048
I mean, it's like a
goddamn confession.

1903
01:26:28,213 --> 01:26:32,352
Yeah, well, I've...
I've decided to...

1904
01:26:32,552 --> 01:26:35,566
Embrace my defects, so...

1905
01:26:35,766 --> 01:26:36,566
Part of the package.

1906
01:26:36,752 --> 01:26:39,727
I got to admit, you really had
me going with all that, you

1907
01:26:39,927 --> 01:26:41,803
know, "Matthew is alive" stuff.

1908
01:26:42,003 --> 01:26:45,177
Yeah, well, we can all close
the book on that one now.

1909
01:26:45,377 --> 01:26:47,101
So, I'm thinking about using

1910
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:50,476
it to, um... launch our
first digital issue.

1911
01:26:50,676 --> 01:26:51,533
Wait. What?

1912
01:26:51,733 --> 01:26:54,224
Oh, yeah. The last paper edition
went out last month, but

1913
01:26:54,424 --> 01:26:56,675
I know that you're not concerned

1914
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:01,148
with such mundane... matters.

1915
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:03,462
Did I tell you that they want

1916
01:27:03,662 --> 01:27:06,963
me to add a lifestyle section?

1917
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:11,524
What does that even mean?

1918
01:27:11,525 --> 01:27:14,462
I have no fucking idea.

1919
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,453
I'm serious.

1920
01:27:15,653 --> 01:27:17,487
I'm proud of you.

1921
01:27:17,687 --> 01:27:20,863
I mean, you could've had
reporters swarming to do a story

1922
01:27:21,063 --> 01:27:23,270
and labels trying to get him to

1923
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,708
sign a new record deal, but
you took the high road.

1924
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,566
Yeah. What is wrong with me?

1925
01:27:28,766 --> 01:27:29,926
There's a lot wrong with you.

1926
01:27:29,966 --> 01:27:30,707
No, but that's...

1927
