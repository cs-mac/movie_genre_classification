1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,670
Kotoko, what are you going to do?

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,470
Next year, we are all going to
start looking for a job.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,660
We need to start doing something.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,010
<i>I thought everyone
was doing amazingly.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,920
<i>But I thought that I hadn't found
anything that I wanted to do.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,160
So do you think I've been egoistic
for hoping my son to...

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,940
take over my company?

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,340
But even though Naoki-kun doesn't
want to, you still have Yuki-kun.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>It will be too late if we
wait for Yuki to grow up.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,120
There is something that
I would like to talk to you about.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,850
I'm thinking of you as my
company's official successor.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,500
<i>That's enough.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,390
Not only my job, but I can't
even choose whom I love.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,380
This is why I don't want to
stay in this house.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,820
The house where I get tied down.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,810
Irie-kun.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,040
I... want to become a doctor.

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,520
Becoming a doctor was...

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,910
the first job that has
interested me in my life.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,650
Don't tell this to anyone, okay?

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,310
<i>Such an important thing...
Why did he tell that only to me?

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,880
<i>I really wanted to tell this
to Naoki, too.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,050
Actually...

24
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,270
Honey?

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,550
Honey. Honey, are you okay?

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,770
<i>Naoki! Naoki!

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,730
It's an unstable angina.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,970
I have already told him the
result of the last routine exam.

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,370
He has never said anything about it.

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,870
Really?

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,650
I assume he didn't want to make you
worry, so he didn't tell you.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,130
So how is his condition?

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,800
Is he okay?

34
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,100
His attack this time was mild.

35
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,410
But if he keeps pushing himself...

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,310
there is a possibility that he will
have a myocardial infarction.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,980
But that's...

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,670
We will do anything to avoid that.

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,600
So he must be on bed rest and get
treatments. Then we'll see how it goes.

40
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,310
He has to stop working completely.

41
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,850
Um, Mrs. Irie, how is Iri-chan?

42
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,230
It looks like he's had a problem
with his heart for a long time.

43
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,510
But he didn't show it to us at all.

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,810
I think he was pushing himself too hard.

45
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,950
Oh no...

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,250
He will be on absolute bed rest for
a while and we'll see how he does.

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,380
But he will be okay if he's on
bed rest, right?

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,850
Yes, so far.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,670
He was suffering so much.

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,150
I had no idea what he was
going through.

51
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,760
I am a failure as a wife.

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,500
It's not your fault, Mrs. Irie.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,240
Iri-chan has always had a sense of
responsibility.

54
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,660
I'm sure there were times he carried
a burden by himself and got stressed out.

55
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,290
Anyway, it's fortunate that this
was no life-threatening situation.

56
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,820
But what about Daddy's company?

57
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,960
What is going to happen to his
company if he takes days off?

58
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,750
I will do it.

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,340
B-but, Naoki.

60
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,060
You said you weren't sure if you
wanted to take over his company.

61
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,220
I think Dad knew about the problem
with his heart.

62
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,260
That's why he rushed and asked me
if I was willing to be his successor.

63
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,390
So... I'm going to save his company.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,720
Thank you, Naoki.

65
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,920
<i>But I'm the only one who knows...

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,020
<i>that his real dream is...

67
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,270
<i>to become a doctor.

68
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,660
<i>He finally found his dream,
but does he have to give it up now?

[Episode 13: A Mischief of Fate]
Irie is working in his father's place?

72
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,320
Yeah, he officially told the school
that he's taking a temporary leave.

73
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,730
He will be focusing on the company
until Mr. Irie gets better.

74
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,730
I see.

75
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,670
It sounds very serious.

76
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,010
But Irie will have no problem
doing it, right?

77
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,290
- He is a genius after all!
- That's right.

78
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,660
And I'm sure he was raised to
take over the company someday.

79
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,320
And how is Mr. Irie?

80
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,090
Kotoko?

81
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,320
<i>Kotoko?

82
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,300
He will stay at the hospital for a while and
take an absolute rest.

83
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,820
Irie-kun will come back to
live with us again.

84
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,900
- I'm sure he is relieved.
- I see.

85
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:06,330
But a time like this, the distance between
you and Irie might become closer.

86
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,470
What?

87
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,290
You see, when you are sick or
when you are in a hospital...

88
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,110
because you feel weak,
it's easier to fall in love.

89
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,490
But it's Mr. Irie who is in the hospital.

90
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,510
But Irie is also anxious.

91
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,430
If Irie-kun is feeling uneasy
and needs help...

92
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,430
if there is something that I can do,
I would do anything.

93
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,850
Way to go, Kotoko.

94
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,610
But I don't want to think about the
relationship between us right now...

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,500
Because, Mr. Irie is sick
and his company is in trouble.

96
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm happy that Irie-kun is coming back
to the house, but...

97
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,780
If Mr. Irie gets better and
Irie-kun starts going to school again...

98
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,130
and studies what he wants to...

99
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm okay with him living away from me.

100
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,740
Oh you, I know that's not
what you really want.

101
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,610
No...

102
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,760
You said it.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,960
That's what I expect from Kotoko.

104
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
Kin-chan.

105
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,590
What do you mean by 'you said it'?

106
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,730
You simply don't want Kotoko
and Irie to get closer.

107
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,940
Stop it!

108
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,230
This is no time to joke around.

109
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,390
His family has a big problem.

110
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,360
It's Irie... I can see him
pretending to be tough.

111
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,440
But I'm sure he feels lonely
and anxious.

112
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,890
If there is something that you can do,
you should do it, Kotoko.

113
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,290
You are right.

114
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,500
If there is something that I can do,
I will help you with that.

115
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,670
So don't hesitate...
just ask me anytime.

116
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,200
Thank you, Kin-chan.

117
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,560
It's about that time.
I have to go.

118
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,850
Bye.

119
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,270
- See you.
- Bye, bye.

120
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,140
Hey, Kin-chan.
What was that all about?

121
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,220
What do you mean 'what?'

122
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,810
Could it be that you gave up
on Kotoko?

123
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,390
- Are you stepping aside for Irie?
- Don't be ridiculous.

124
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,610
I'm not talking about
something so low-level.

125
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,850
It's like I'm sending
support to my enemy.

126
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,880
Irie's family is in trouble...

127
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,720
If I take advantage of this situation
and take Kotoko from them...

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,130
it would make me less of a man.

129
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,960
After all, you and Kotoko are so similar.

130
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,990
Because what you just said is
the same as what Kotoko said.

131
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,310
'I don't care about myself, but
I want the person I love to be happy.'

132
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,260
That's true. You are like her.

133
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,830
You and Kotoko are actually
a good couple.

134
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,940
But...

135
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,520
- Just kidding.
- What?

136
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,650
- Kotoko can't love anyone but Irie.
- Right.

137
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,740
Never mind.

138
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,800
What?

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,190
What?

140
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,490
Please have some.

141
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,250
Tonight, we have stewed taro roots,
teriyaki yellowtail...

142
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,820
miso soup, kidney beans
with sesame seeds...

143
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,860
- and I guess you can call this boiled tofu.
- Ahh!

144
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,790
It's hot.

145
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,260
Too spicy.

146
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,500
- Too spicy?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,070
It can't be...

148
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,250
Why? Why is it?

149
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,940
Why is it hot?

150
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,800
It's too spicy.

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,890
Big Brother, it's too spicy.
You shouldn't eat it.

152
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,590
It's hot.

153
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,330
Big Brother, what was that sound?

154
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,930
The taro root.

155
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,910
Usually taro roots don't make that sound.

156
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,550
Undercooked!

157
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,790
Big Brother, hurry and spit it out!

158
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,430
Don't force yourself to eat it.
You shouldn't eat it.

159
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,710
- What?
- What?

160
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,300
Stop complaining and eat
your food, Yuki.

161
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,140
What?

162
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,580
Ah, Irie-kun.

163
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,620
Do you want me to make
some coffee for you?

164
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,850
Sure.

165
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,940
Um, Irie-kun...

166
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,200
Are you going to take over
Mr. Irie's company?

167
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,150
You told me before that
you wanted to become a doctor.

168
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,490
I don't want to run away.

169
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,440
I told you...

170
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,210
I've been undergoing so many
trials since I met you.

171
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,940
I never imagined that my father
would collapse.

172
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,310
But I decided that I wouldn't run away.

173
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,190
Irie-kun.

174
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,630
When his heart recovers,
I will go back to school.

175
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,610
It's not too late to do what
I want after that.

176
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,430
I don't think it's a bad idea
to learn the ropes now.

177
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,240
I see.

178
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,210
If there is something that I can do,
please let me know.

179
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,720
Oh right, coffee.

180
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,820
During the time the president is
in the hospital, I will be your aid.

181
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,400
My name is Kanamori.
Pleased to meet you.

182
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,510
Please.

183
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,920
Now then, let me explain the materials
that I gave to you the other day.

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,000
You don't need to.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,360
I took a look at them all last night.

186
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,580
You read them all by yourself?

187
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,780
The company's performance declined
significantly from last year.

188
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,410
Yes.

189
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,700
This is the inventory list
of our most popular product.

190
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,960
The sales have dropped drastically.

191
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,660
Our rival company's similar product is
taking our customers away from us.

192
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,830
The president was also
concerned about this matter.

193
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,460
At this rate, Pandai may
have to go through with a merger.

194
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,180
We need an enormous amount
of financial support immediately.

195
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,160
No wonder his heart became weak.

196
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,830
Okay.

197
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,430
Irie-kun is working so hard.

198
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm going to work hard making his
lunches and doing house chores.

199
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,160
Alright!

200
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,980
It feels... kind of like we're a
newlywed couple.

201
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,830
'Fight with love...'

202
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,940
Which one comes first, H or G?

203
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,150
Oh well, this is okay.

204
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,090
Heart, heart.

205
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
Love, love, heart.

206
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,030
G should come before H.

207
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,840
Welcome home.

208
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,540
Would you like to take a bath first
or would you like to eat first?

209
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,590
Oh, your jacket...

210
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,510
Breathe in, please.

211
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,650
Breathe out, please.

212
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,610
Hey, Irie-kun, Irie-kun.

213
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,210
Your bag.

214
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,610
Have a good day!

215
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,420
Good luck!

216
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,200
We will try to gain profit from
the copyrights of all the merchandise.

217
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,450
By producing an animation...

218
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,810
we will have the initiative
and obtain its copyrights.

219
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,210
Our unique business style is to take
a partnership with oversea companies.

220
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,400
Do you know that too much miso
makes the soup too salty?

221
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,990
So salty.

222
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,470
But today's taro roots are
pretty good.

223
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,220
I'm sorry, Sudo-san.

224
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,250
[Request to leave the club temporarily]
- I see...

225
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,830
Irie's father is still not doing well?

226
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,830
No.

227
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,330
That's why I can't spend
much time at school.

228
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,200
I understand.

229
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,690
You and Irie are both our
precious tennis club members.

230
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,820
When Mr. Irie gets better,
you have to come back.

231
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,220
We will be waiting for you.

232
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,300
Thank you very much, Sudo-san.

233
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,780
It's not only you, Aihara.
We are all worried about Irie.

234
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,510
There are girls who miss him...

235
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,330
Like Ayako Matsumoto...

236
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,820
Leader!

237
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,010
I'm sorry, I'm late.

238
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,350
- I am not coming to the practice today.
- Huh?

239
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,900
New members are not allow to miss
a practice without my permission!

240
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,600
That's why I'm here to tell you.

241
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,570
Today I have a date with
my boyfriend, Taketo-kun.

242
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,720
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

243
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,640
- When did this happen?
- I'm sorry.

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,600
But I'm going to borrow Ayako.

245
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,230
Kotoko-san, I heard about
Naoki-san's father.

246
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,710
Please tell him that I'm rooting for him.

247
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,060
Well then...

248
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,180
W-w-what?

249
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,940
Didn't she declare that she
was going to win Irie's heart?

250
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,770
How can she change so quickly?

251
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,340
Oh, she must be a part of that new
breed of Japanese kids. She must be!

252
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,980
- What are you talking about?
- What?

253
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,660
Then do you know 'Now Young?'

254
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,920
'Now young?'
You've totally lost me.

255
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,390
I see.

256
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,810
Ouch.

257
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,570
Oh, I'm sorry, Kotoko-san.

258
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,620
Can we talk for a little?

259
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,580
And... how is Irie-kun?

260
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,320
He is busy working at the company.

261
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,230
He comes home after midnight everyday.

262
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,280
Well, I'm always up waiting for him.

263
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,390
So that means there is a
possibility that...

264
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,900
he will quit the school and
take over the company.

265
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,920
Um, he is only taking a leave
from school temporarily.

266
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,950
He will come back eventually.

267
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,490
I wonder.

268
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,620
There is no need for him to come back to school
if he is taking over his father's company.

269
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,180
Um, but...

270
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,510
<i>When his heart recovers,
I will go back to school.

271
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,490
<i>It's not too late to do what
I want after that.

272
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,740
I don't think it's a bad idea
to learn the ropes now.

273
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:04,280
Irie-kun... wants to come back to school.

274
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,580
What I'm saying is that even if...

275
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,140
he does want to come back,
reality doesn't allow him to do that.

276
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,290
Oh.

277
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,520
Hey, why don't you liberate him
from your lunch boxes?

278
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,040
You are turning
his lunch time into a hell.

279
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,030
H-how do you know that
I'm making him lunch boxes?

280
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,960
I know you two.

281
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,710
I'm pretty sure that nothing
happened between you two.

282
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,420
Oh well, well, well...

283
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,500
Well, well, well...

284
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,570
Goodbye.

285
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm home.

286
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,840
Ah, welcome back!

287
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,410
Mom!

288
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,620
It's great to be at my own house!

289
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:17,010
There are checkups and visitors
all day at the hospital. It's so restless.

290
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,890
What? He can see visitors now?

291
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,300
The doctor recommended that he
take it easy.

292
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,460
But he would let work related
people see him.

293
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,410
But I have good news!

294
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,440
It seems like he can come
home next month.

295
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,770
Really?

296
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm so glad.

297
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,320
It depends on the result of
the detailed exam...

298
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,460
but now his condition is stable,
so we will try to bring him home.

299
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,470
I think Daddy will be more relaxed at home
than he is at the hospital.

300
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,950
I'm sure.

301
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,680
We will cause you trouble
a little bit more, Kotoko-chan.

302
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,160
No problem.

303
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,520
You should take care
of yourself, Mrs. Irie.

304
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,490
Thank you.

305
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,390
Now I will get his clean clothes
and go back to the hospital.

306
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,970
Yes.

307
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,830
- Yuki, be a good boy, okay?
- Okay.

308
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,530
<i>Good.

309
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,570
<i>When Mr. Irie comes home from the hospital,
Irie-kun can go back to school.

310
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,410
<i>He will be able to study and pursue
his dream of becoming a doctor.

311
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,420
Thanks to everyone's support,
he will be able to go home next month.

312
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,930
That's good to hear.

313
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,760
Well, but Naoki-san is amazing.

314
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,400
He has done well
with taking his father's place.

315
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,970
It's hard to believe
that he is still in college.

316
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,190
You are so dependable, Naoki.

317
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,590
Naoki?

318
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,660
Strange. I don't think there are
any visitors besides us today.

319
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,830
- I see. I see.
- Dad.

320
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,800
You should be resting.

321
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,930
Chairman Oizumi.

322
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,800
I was in the neighborhood,
so I decided to stop by.

323
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,060
Naoki-san.

324
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,000
This is Hokueisha Chairman Oizumi
and his secretary Mr. Yokoyama.

325
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,300
I'm sorry for not
introducing myself sooner.

326
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,910
I am Naoki Irie.

327
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,310
Irie?

328
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,630
Oh, Chairman,
I'm sorry for being rude.

329
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,400
This is my son, Naoki. Currently he is
getting trained at my company.

330
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,260
I see. He seems like a very
dependable young man.

331
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,440
Thank you.

332
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,030
Chairman, since everyone is here,
we should talk about the plan.

333
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,940
President Irie...

334
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:57,430
We would like to discuss
investing in your company.

335
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,910
Yokoyama, we are at the hospital.

336
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,590
Oh, I'm sorry for being rude.

337
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:07,670
But I thought his son and Mr. Kanamori
should know about this too.

338
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,510
Yes, of course.

339
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,590
Honey, could you pass me
those papers over there?

340
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,750
But...

341
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,060
I hate to be rude...

342
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,660
but I have to ask you to
leave for today.

343
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,810
Naoki.

344
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,380
Chairman Oizumi came
all the way to see me.

345
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,210
I am really sorry,
but my father needs to rest.

346
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,590
He is not in the condition
to be working.

347
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,570
Chairman.

348
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,740
In that case, I suggest we
reconsider the investment plan.

349
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,880
Chairman.

350
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,290
On behalf of my father, I would like to
discuss the investment plan with you.

351
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
You have been very rude.

352
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,950
- A young fellow like you...
- I am the acting president now.

353
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,570
I would like to visit your
company tomorrow.

354
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,470
So I would like to ask you to
leave today.

355
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,980
It's not good for my father's health.

356
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,460
Hey, Naoki.

357
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,680
Please leave everything to me
while you are in the hospital.

358
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,370
I came to wish you a speedy recovery, but
it seems like I was being a nuisance.

359
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,400
Well then, please excuse us, Irie-kun.

360
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,200
You took time to come visit me.
I am sorry that you have to leave.

361
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,640
Yokoyama.

362
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,280
What is my schedule tomorrow?

363
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,550
Yes?

364
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,450
I am asking you when I'm
available tomorrow.

365
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,430
Well, before lunch with the minister,
you are available from 11 am to noon.

366
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,850
That's how it is.
What do you say?

367
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,730
Thank you very much. I will definitely
be there at 11 o'clock.

368
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,070
He made Chairman Oizumi
make time for him.

369
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,970
Naoki-san is incredible.

370
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,480
Indeed.

371
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,360
This never happens.

372
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,600
For these reasons, I can promise quite
enough profit for your company.

373
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,640
What do you think, Yokoyama?

374
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,770
For a student who has no experience
but learned management from lectures...

375
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,070
the presentation was well done.

376
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,500
Excuse me, but I am in the science
and engineering department.

377
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,320
I taught myself management.

378
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,920
I see.

379
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,560
But aren't you planning to become
the successor of Pandai?

380
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,550
Why are you in the science
and engineering department?

381
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:07,600
It's because I wanted to have a broad
and diverse range of knowledge.

382
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,910
I don't think a person with a narrow range
of knowledge can survive in this society.

383
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,090
Excuse me.

384
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,070
Are you okay?

385
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,720
Yes.

386
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,260
Please be careful.

387
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:14,250
Oh Naoki, I know you're busy.
I'm sorry for asking you to leave work.

388
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,880
More importantly... you said there is
something urgent to tell me?

389
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,510
Because I didn't want Yuki
to hear this...

390
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,390
Welcome home.
You are late again.

391
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,410
I will heat up dinner right away.

392
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,580
You don't need to.

393
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,420
What? Did you have dinner already?

394
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,500
I don't have an appetite.

395
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,900
Irie-kun.

396
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,220
Here is your lunch box.

397
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,240
Oh.

398
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,910
You seem very tired.
Are you okay?

399
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,100
Irie-kun?

400
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,210
I was thinking about something.

401
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,670
I'm going.

402
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,400
Have a good day.

403
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,190
Big Brother... I hope he's okay.

404
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,580
Here.

405
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,950
Wow, looks so delicious.

406
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,970
It's from Boss.

407
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,280
He said it must be hard
for you to cook everyday.

408
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,750
Thank you. This helps me a lot.

409
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,390
You should thank Boss.

410
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,370
Hey Kotoko, you aren't
going to school lately, are you?

411
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,610
No.

412
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,590
Are you okay with that?

413
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,320
I decided to go to college on my own,
so I will definitely try to graduate.

414
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,830
But right now, I want
to help the Irie family.

415
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,160
Not the Irie family...

416
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,110
You mean Irie, right?

417
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,290
I know what's in your mind.

418
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,590
Well, sometimes I wish I didn't know.

419
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,840
Kin-chan.

420
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,960
Anyway, no matter what happens,
I'm on your side.

421
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,550
Don't carry everything by yourself.
Let me know if you need my help.

422
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,610
Not only cooking, but anything else
like attending a class for you.

423
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,090
Thank you, Kin-chan.

424
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,300
Except...

425
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,030
I won't write a paper for you.

426
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,200
If I do that,
you are going to fail your class.

427
00:32:58,850 --> 00:32:59,870
Geez.

428
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,360
Don't you think tonight's
dinner is delicious?

429
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,990
Your father made this, right?

430
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,930
You knew?

431
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,700
How could you think I wouldn't know?

432
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,940
It's way better than your food.

433
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,410
Excuse me, I am trying
my best too, you know.

434
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,890
Can you appreciate what
I do for once?

435
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,540
Thank you.

436
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,370
You are always saying mean things to me.

437
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,430
What?

438
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,520
You've improved a lot.

439
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,230
Thank you for the food.

440
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,760
Irie-kun is late.

441
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,210
Irie-kun!

442
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,260
Oh, it's Sudo-san.

443
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,530
Hello.

444
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,410
Oh, Aihara.
There is a big problem.

445
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,000
What happened?

446
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,520
To tell Matsumoto that I love her...

447
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,890
What?

448
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,560
Did you finally tell her
that you love her?

449
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,900
No, I was going to...

450
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,570
Oh, okay.

451
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,570
Please don't call me just to tell
me such a trifling thing!

452
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,670
No, no, no. And then she said
there was someone she loved.

453
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,820
I'm sure she would say that.

454
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,800
We all know that she loves Irie-kun,
I thought you knew...

455
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,250
<i>No, that's not what I'm saying!

456
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,100
I know she loves him already.

457
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,350
She said she was going
to tell Irie she loves him.

458
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,030
Of course if she loves someone,
she would want to tell him her feelings...

459
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,990
What?

460
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,910
Matsumoto-san is going to tell
Irie-kun that she loves him?

461
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,170
When... when is she going to do it?

462
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,320
Tonight.

463
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,360
Tonight?

464
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,640
Where and when is Matsumoto-san
going to tell Irie-kun?

465
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,550
Don't tell me that she's
already told him?

466
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,130
No!

467
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,440
I'm sorry that I was waiting
for you here.

468
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,280
You must have waited for a long time.

469
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,670
If you wanted to tell me something,
you could've waited at my house.

470
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,030
I didn't want to do that.

471
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,620
I wanted to tell you alone.

472
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,800
I know I am being selfish.

473
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,170
You are in a difficult situation right now.

474
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,700
But...

475
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,990
What is it?

476
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,000
I love you, Irie-kun.

477
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,210
You see? I said it to you straight.

478
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,200
So I want you to tell me how
you feel about me straight, too.

479
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,200
What do you think about me?

480
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,520
Sorry.

481
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:09,800
I can't think of you as more than a friend.

482
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,500
I really love you, Irie-kun.

483
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,150
I've never felt like this before.

484
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,270
So...

485
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,530
I can't give up.

486
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,310
Huh?

487
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,740
Do you feel better now?

488
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,350
I'm sorry, but I don't want to do
something like that with you.

489
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,200
Why don't you want it with me?

490
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,600
Then whom would you kiss?

491
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,700
I've kissed someone.

492
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,910
I kissed Kotoko.

493
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,480
I feel so insulted by this.

494
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,920
My pride is torn apart.

495
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,850
I pray for your father to
get better soon.

496
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,890
<i>The kiss we had...
it happened more than a year ago.

497
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,330
<i>Why did he say that now?

498
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,270
Hey.

499
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,360
Stop eavesdropping on my love life.

500
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,000
Sorry.

501
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,400
I was worried because you were late.

502
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,270
Irie-kun?

503
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,450
My father is actually not doing well.

504
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,790
What?

505
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,130
Today I went to listen to
the doctor with my mother.

506
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,030
It seems like his condition
is stable now.

507
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,990
But according to the results
of the detailed exam...

508
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,900
he has a heart disease.

509
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,170
As soon as they are ready,
he is going to have an operation.

510
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,780
Is it a difficult operation?

511
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,130
It's his heart.

512
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:20,030
Even if the operation is successful,
he won't go back to work for a while.

513
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,190
I see.

514
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:33,550
I think the disease is caused
by stress and anxiety.

515
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:43,110
Because of this depression,
the company's performance has gotten worse.

516
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:52,690
That's why he wanted me to take over
the company as soon as possible.

517
00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:00,040
I'm thinking of you as my
company's official successor.

518
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,480
At this rate, Pandai may
have to go through with a merger.

519
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:12,480
If I take over the company,
all of the problems will be solved.

520
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,060
But your dream is to
become a doctor, isn't it?

521
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,620
It's hasn't been long
since I had that dream.

522
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,080
I... want to become a doctor.

523
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,650
I'm not sure if I'm suited for it...

524
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,450
but I want to study properly.

525
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,690
So you are going to give up?

526
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,550
Irie-kun.

527
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,960
<i>Becoming a doctor was...

528
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,660
the first job that has
interested me in my life.

529
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,930
<i>Irie-kun looked so sad...

530
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:43,660
<i>Before I knew it, I was hugging Irie-kun.

531
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,710
<i>But he didn't take my hands away.

532
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,960
<i>At that moment...

533
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,150
<i>I felt like our hearts were connected.

534
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,800
Irie-kun, here is your lunch box.

535
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,260
I'm confident with today's rolled egg.
And there is sauteed leek.

536
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,840
I've heard that leek makes you smart.

537
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,540
Then why don't you eat it?

538
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,990
Have a good day!

539
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,810
<i>Despite that...

540
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,020
I'm delighted that you paid
a visit to our company, Chairman.

541
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,500
- Thank you very much for coming.
- Well, well...

542
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,390
I had something to do
in this area today.

543
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,280
You are by yourself today?

544
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,140
I came here to talk to you
about a personal matter, Naoki-kun.

545
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,180
Talk to me?

546
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,180
Naoki-kun, would you like to have
an arranged marriage meeting?

547
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,660
I know it's not the best time
since Irie-kun is in the hospital...

548
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,110
I have a granddaughter.

549
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,460
She is your age and goes to
Seishin Women's College.

550
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,670
It's a real prestigious school.

551
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,840
What do you think, Naoki-kun?

552
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,160
Would you at least like to meet her?

553
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,340
You are young.

554
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm sure you need time to
think about it.

555
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,050
After discussing it with your parents...

556
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,750
please give me your answer in
the next few days.

557
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:03,560
We will talk about the
investment plan afterward.

558
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,280
I'm sorry for visiting you
without notice.

559
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,810
Please don't apologize.

560
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,730
Well then, Naoki-kun.
Please consider this carefully.

561
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,350
Yes.

562
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,210
Thank you very much.

563
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,610
Naoki-san.

564
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,050
This meeting is...

565
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,460
going to be a great
advantage for the company.

566
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,380
<i>Our fate was about to
start moving significantly...

00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,300
Is it true that you will have
an arranged marriage meeting?

585
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,970
Yes, I like her.

586
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,640
Do you remember me?

587
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,080
I especially don't forget a
beautiful woman.

588
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,310
I have a good idea.

589
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,150
You are going to ruin the meeting?

590
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,390
For only this time,
I will join your plan.

591
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,190
This is not like what you had before.

592
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,300
An arranged meeting
is between families.

593
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,070
I will take Kotoko away from you.

594
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,350
Do whatever you want.

595
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:56,530
The girl you love is Kotoko,
right, Big Brother?

596
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,550
I'm sure everything will work out.
