Aside from getting

to engelbrecht

509
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,424
A couple of months ago.

510
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,785
The man had two kids
with a zulu worker.

511
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,964
Wouldn't have anything
to do with them.

512
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,503
And on top of that,
he refused to pay lobola.

Mm-mm.

514

Let me tell you something,
percy.

515
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,439
If there's one nation
that knows how to retaliate,

516
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,369
It's the zulus.

517
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,843
These guys have been fighting
blood feuds for generations.

each other today

And you'd better
listen carefully.

526

The most dangerous job
in the world

527
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,900
Is being a farmer
in south africa.

528
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,572
You know,
I read in the <i>farmer's weekly</i>

529
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,840
That more than 1600 farmers
had been murdered

530
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,271
In 8000 farm attacks.

531
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,106
One thousand, six hundred.

532
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,882
And some of those
were my friends.

533
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,380
So that is what
your so-called freedom brings...

Those were my favorite pants,
you twit.

537

So if that is what
your so-called freedom brings,

538
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,470
You'd better recognize
the place and times.

I'm sorry.

It feels like I'm getting
nowhere. I'm trying my best.

Okay, I'll try them.

553

I'll take these stupid pills.

there's an emptiness

In the hearts of all people.

661
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:06,796
An emptiness...

662
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:10,644
<i>That nothing</i>
<i>but the lord himself can fill.</i>

663
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,441
<i>For god so loved the world...</i>

664
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,050
That he gave his only son,

665
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,977
So that whoever--

666
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,154

To zambia and then
he started farming there.

690
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:27,076
And like him, I'm a little bit
stubborn and crazy. Heh.

gave it to the english,

Well, god loves wild men who

He put that wildness in you.

He loves you.
He's crazy about you.

dancing naked before the lord.

when I was in there was--

that god used ordinary people.

Eighteen of them
were from my church.

It was an exercise in futility,
preaching to the choir.

trust god.

Trust god.

1637
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:12,655
Don't be gripped by the fear
of what el niño can do to you,

1638
01:41:12,666 --> 01:41:15,466
But be gripped
by what god did for you

1639
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:18,339
Through jesus on the cross.

1640
01:41:18,338 --> 01:41:21,468
And I know that god
answers the prayers

1641
01:41:21,475 --> 01:41:24,405
Of his people.

1642
01:41:25,178 --> 01:41:26,778
And that's why,

1643
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:30,720
This year at this time,

1644
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,217
We're going back

1645
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:35,349
And we're gonna
plant potatoes.

1646

1649
01:41:41,328 --> 01:41:42,188

01:41:52,572 --> 01:41:55,842
God, give us the rain we need.

1656
01:41:55,843 --> 01:42:00,583
Deliver us from the violence
and the murders, god.

1657
01:42:01,447 --> 01:42:04,877
Bring peace
in our land, lord.

1658
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:07,615
And bring peace
in our hearts.

1659
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:11,421
Shower this land, lord,
with your blessing.

1660
01:42:11,425 --> 01:42:15,855
It's so dry
and so thirsty, god.

Bring your blessing, lord.

Well, you've been such an

01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:29,704
I just don't
want you to make

1673
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:32,703
A stupid mistake, I--

1674
01:43:33,306 --> 01:43:35,466
You know,
there's a very fine line

1675
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:38,705
Between faith
and foolishness.

1676
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:39,712
I don't want you to--

1677
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:42,383
I don't think
you should plant potatoes.

1678
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:43,752
What do you think, steyn?

1679
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,720
Mm. I don't know.

1680
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:49,549
But angus has been right
so many times before.

1681
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,286
There's one other
possibility.

1682
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:55,491
We could just wait a few days
until it rains.

1683
01:43:55,928 --> 01:43:57,958
I mean,
look at the field.

1684
01:43:57,965 --> 01:43:59,455
Look at the dust.

1685
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:00,526
Nothing can grow
in this.

1686
01:44:00,534 --> 01:44:04,844
If you plant the potatoes now,
they're gonna die and that's it.

1687
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:06,868
You know that.

1688
01:44:07,607 --> 01:44:09,607
If god spoke to you,
I mean,

1689
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:14,450
I'd be the last one who would
wanna go against that, I hope.

1690
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:16,648
I just don't know.

1691
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,950
Did he speak to you?

1692
01:44:18,952 --> 01:44:19,682
I just--

1693
01:44:19,686 --> 01:44:21,786
When I prayed,
I just felt god say to me:

1694
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:24,888
"don't look
at the weather phenomenons

1695
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,831
And the weather conditions."

1696
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:29,857
But I needed
to trust him.

1697
01:44:30,763 --> 01:44:32,763
And then I read a scripture

1698
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:36,326
In ecclesiastes and it said:

1699
01:44:36,336 --> 01:44:38,636
"those who observe the wind
will not sow.

1700
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,739
And he who regards the clouds
will not reap."

1701
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:42,872
Will not reap, yeah.

1702
