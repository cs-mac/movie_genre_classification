<i>(BETSEY) How is she.?
(DR CHILLIP) She is a he.</i>

2
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:08,407
<i>(BETSEY) What.?
(DR CHILLIP) The baby is a boy.</i>

3
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:12,206
A boy? A boy!

4
01:27:12,447 --> 01:27:14,609
<i>(DAN) You're most welcome,
Master Copperfield.</i>

5
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:17,947
<i>You'll find us rough,
but you'll find us ready.</i>

6
01:27:18,156 --> 01:27:20,251
<i>(YOUNG DAVID)
Let's always be friends, Emily.</i>

7
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:24,456
<i>(YOUNG EMILY) I'd like that,
but you'll be a gentleman one day.</i>

8
01:27:25,702 --> 01:27:27,170
Argh!

9
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:30,673
<i>(CREAKLE)
So you like biting, do you.?</i>

10
01:27:32,346 --> 01:27:34,076
<i>(STEERFORTH) Stings, don't it.?
(YOUNG DAVID) A bit.</i>

11
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:37,652
You're as fresh as a daisy.
My name is Steerforth, by the way.

12
01:27:37,788 --> 01:27:39,518
There's no need to "sir" me.

13
01:27:39,757 --> 01:27:44,093
<i>(CREAKLE) It grieves me to tell you
that your mother is very ill</i>

14
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:46,734
<i>She is very dangerously ill</i>

15
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:49,998
In fact, she's dead.

16
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:53,738
<i>(PEGGOTTY)
Listen to me, my darling boy.</i>

17
01:27:53,913 --> 01:27:58,546
<i>Don't lose heart, and never forget
how much your Peggotty loves you.</i>

18
01:27:59,655 --> 01:28:04,095
<i>(MICAWBER) I am convinced
that you will, in short, go far.</i>

19
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:09,099
To Copperfield.
Not just a lodger - a friend.

20
01:28:09,337 --> 01:28:11,067
I never will forget you.

21
01:28:12,108 --> 01:28:15,170
<i>(BETSEY) You broke her heart,
then punished the boy,</i>

22
01:28:15,379 --> 01:28:18,612
because of your own guilt!

23
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:25,992
Oh, Mr Dick. You'll consider yourself
joint guardian with me of this boy.

24
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:28,894
<i>I think perhaps
he should take the name Trotwood.</i>

25
01:28:29,068 --> 01:28:32,597
<i>(MR DICK) Trotwood Copperfield.!
(BETSEY) Trotwood Copperfield.!</i>

26
01:28:32,773 --> 01:28:36,302
Perhaps you'll be
a partner in Wickfield's business one day.

27
01:28:36,546 --> 01:28:39,676
Oh, no, Master Copperfield.
Ambition ain't for me.

28
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,123
<i>A person like myself
had better not aspire.</i>

29
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:48,058
Do not concern yourself.
I will look after him.

30
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:50,666
<i>(DAVID) As you have always done.</i>

31
01:28:50,802 --> 01:28:55,537
<i>(SPENLOW) My daughter
is holding a picnic next Saturday.</i>

32
01:28:55,777 --> 01:28:58,508
<i>Perhaps you'd care to join us.?</i>

33
01:29:02,721 --> 01:29:05,714

01:29:26,558 --> 01:29:30,622
<i>I was independent, a young man
making his way in the world.</i>

37
01:29:30,765 --> 01:29:34,328
<i>But what did any of this mean
without Dora.?</i>

38
01:29:34,504 --> 01:29:37,771
<i>I was determined to win her heart.</i>

39
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:40,502
<i>I knew my happiness depended on it.</i>

40
01:29:43,151 --> 01:29:47,055
Miss Spenlow.
In honour of your birthday...

41
01:29:47,993 --> 01:29:50,121
What a dear bouquet!

42
01:29:50,263 --> 01:29:52,425
They're beautiful flowers,
Mr Copperfield.

43
01:29:52,599 --> 01:29:55,570
I thought them beautiful
until I saw you.

44
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:00,141
Come. Join us.

<i>Little had been said,
but I was filled with the hope</i>

01:30:34,632 --> 01:30:38,662
<i>that some vital understanding
had been reached between us.</i>

54

<i>For the next few days,
greatly to Mrs Crupp's discomfort,</i>

55
01:30:44,414 --> 01:30:47,943
<i>I lived on nothing
but Dora and coffee.</i>

56
01:30:48,087 --> 01:30:50,022
Skittles, Mr Copperfull

57
01:30:50,256 --> 01:30:54,889
When there's a young lady
in the case, skittles is healthy.

58
01:30:55,098 --> 01:30:57,260
Diverts the mind, does you good.

59
01:30:57,435 --> 01:30:58,697
Oh...

60
01:30:58,903 --> 01:31:02,102
<i>I satisfied my appetite
by writing her numerous letters,</i>

61
01:31:02,242 --> 01:31:04,735
<i>hoping that she would detect
the desperate passion</i>

62
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,817
<i>that lay beneath their formal exterior.</i>

63
01:31:08,886 --> 01:31:10,445
<i>Thankfully, for my sanity,</i>

64
01:31:10,622 --> 01:31:15,824
<i>I was at last distracted by an invitation
to join Agnes at a London party.</i>

65
01:31:16,097 --> 01:31:17,861
Trotwood!

66
01:31:19,002 --> 01:31:21,996
Agnes! How wonderful
to receive your invitation.

67
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:23,837
We see you so rarely these days.

68
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:28,244
My dear sister, I've so much
to tell you about what I've been doing.

69
01:31:29,285 --> 01:31:32,484
Uriah. How are you?

70
01:31:32,657 --> 01:31:37,859
Much obliged for your condescension
to an 'umble person, Master Copperfield.

71
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:45,169
Take no notice of me. I am invisible.

72
01:31:46,913 --> 01:31:49,782
Things have changed
since you left, Trotwood.

73
01:31:49,918 --> 01:31:52,444
Papa is to make Uriah his partner.

74
01:31:53,557 --> 01:31:56,551
- But he's not to be trusted!
- Uriah has made himself indispensable.

75
01:31:56,795 --> 01:31:58,730
I have a good mind to...

76
01:31:58,865 --> 01:32:02,166
Promise me you'll do nothing
to offend Uriah.

77
01:32:05,843 --> 01:32:07,539
You fell in love on the spot.

78
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,412
More than that.
I completely and utterly adore her.

79
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:14,611
But what about you, Agnes?

80
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:17,226
Have you no admirers
to tell me about?

81
01:32:17,361 --> 01:32:20,388
Of course not.
I have no time for anything like that.

82
01:32:20,532 --> 01:32:22,262
Have you seen
the new play at Covent Garden?

83
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:24,563
(STEERFORTH) A miserable business!

84
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,105
(DAVID) Steerforth!

85
01:32:28,278 --> 01:32:32,046
You don't remember me.
David Copperfield.

86
01:32:32,284 --> 01:32:35,187
My God! Little Copperfield!

87
01:32:35,322 --> 01:32:37,883
- I'm overjoyed to see you.
- You haven't changed a bit, Daisy.

88
01:32:38,127 --> 01:32:40,722
This is Miss Wickfield, an old friend.

89
01:32:40,898 --> 01:32:45,463
Delighted. You have the prettiest girl
in the place on your arm, Daisy.

90
01:32:45,605 --> 01:32:47,506
Why do you call him "Daisy"?

91
01:32:47,675 --> 01:32:50,544
Merely a nickname from school
You don't mind, do you, Daisy?

92
01:32:50,713 --> 01:32:52,011
Not in the least.

93
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:54,550
I'm staying at my mother's.
You must call on me.

94
01:32:54,753 --> 01:32:59,853
I want to know what you've been doing.
I feel as though you're my property.

95
01:33:02,566 --> 01:33:05,695
Of all people! What luck.

96
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,306
Sometimes it is wiser
to leave the past alone.

97
01:33:08,474 --> 01:33:10,306
Perhaps you shouldn't go to see him.

98
01:33:10,477 --> 01:33:14,644
Why not? He's the best friend
I ever had in the world.

99
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:28,103
Going home, Master Copperfield?

100
01:33:28,272 --> 01:33:32,439
Indeed, Uriah. Perhaps you would care
to join me for some coffee?

101
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:36,879
<i>Oh, really, Master...
I mean MisterCopperfield.</i>

102
01:33:37,019 --> 01:33:40,218
I'm sure you wouldn't want
a 'umble person like me in your house.

103
01:33:40,424 --> 01:33:42,724
I wouldn't ask you if I didn't.

104
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:47,897
Do you remember saying to me once

105
01:33:48,037 --> 01:33:52,567
that perhaps I should become a partner
in Mr Wickfield's business one day?

106
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:55,679
What a prophet you have
shown yourself, Mr Copperfield.

107
01:33:55,915 --> 01:33:58,215
I don't suppose
I really thought it likely.

108
01:34:00,123 --> 01:34:01,989
Oh, who would have?

109
01:34:02,126 --> 01:34:06,030
But the 'umblest persons
may be the instruments of good.

110
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:12,665
Mr Wickfield is the worthiest of men,
but, oh, how imprudent he has been.

111
01:34:12,909 --> 01:34:16,677
- Has he been imprudent?
- If anyone else had been in my place,

112
01:34:16,915 --> 01:34:20,011
Mr Wickfield would have been
under his thumb by now.

113
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:24,319
Without me, there would have been
loss and disgrace,

114
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:27,259
and Mr Wickfield knows it.

115
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:34,671
Did you think Miss Agnes
looked very beautiful tonight?

116
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:37,280
I thought her looking
as she always does,

117
01:34:37,414 --> 01:34:39,645
superior to everyone around her.

118
01:34:40,519 --> 01:34:43,490
Thank you.
Thank you very much for that.

119
01:34:43,624 --> 01:34:45,855
Why should you thank me?

120
01:34:46,996 --> 01:34:49,522
You will not think the worse
of my 'umbleness

121
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:53,606
if I make you a little confidence,
Mr Copperfield?

122
01:34:53,774 --> 01:34:56,005
Of course not.

123
01:34:56,144 --> 01:34:59,912
The image of Miss Agnes
has been in my breast for years.

124
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:03,111
Oh, with what pure affection
do I love the ground she walks on!

125
01:35:03,355 --> 01:35:05,290
Does she know of these feelings?

126
01:35:05,425 --> 01:35:08,919
Oh, no! Oh, dear, no!

127
01:35:09,097 --> 01:35:14,037
You see, I'm just emerging
from my lowly station,

128
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:18,043
but I rest my hope
on my usefulness to her father.

129
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:23,186
She's so much attached to him,
she may come, on his account,

130
01:35:23,354 --> 01:35:26,518
to be kind to me.

131
01:35:28,762 --> 01:35:31,892
If you'll keep my secret
and not go against me with my Agnes,

132
01:35:32,034 --> 01:35:34,970
I will take it as a particular favour.

133
01:35:35,138 --> 01:35:37,938
You wouldn't wish
to make unpleasantness.

134
01:35:39,445 --> 01:35:41,914
Who knows what
the consequences might be?

135
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:46,717
(CLOCK STRIKES)

136
01:35:46,957 --> 01:35:49,223
Dear me. One o'clock.

137
01:35:50,196 --> 01:35:52,826
My boarding house
will be locked by now.

138
01:35:58,175 --> 01:36:00,235
<i>Dear Agnes.</i>

139
01:36:00,378 --> 01:36:03,975
<i>Too loving and good
for anyone I could think of.</i>

140
01:36:04,151 --> 01:36:08,853
<i>Was it possible she was reserved
to be the wife of such a wretch as this.?</i>

141
01:36:14,434 --> 01:36:17,963
You walk at a somewhat
lively pace, Mr Copperfield.

142
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:20,541
I wouldn't want you
to miss your coach.

143
01:36:20,777 --> 01:36:24,340
I'll be back with the law
next time, Micawber!

144
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,415
Mr Micawber!

145
01:36:27,187 --> 01:36:29,157
Open up, it's Copperfield!

146
01:36:32,395 --> 01:36:36,164
Mr Micawber! It's David Copperfield!

147
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:43,436
(MICAWBER) Is it possible?

148
01:36:43,613 --> 01:36:45,741
Have I again the pleasure of beholding

149
01:36:45,883 --> 01:36:49,252
the infant scourge
of the pawnbroking profession?

150
01:36:50,791 --> 01:36:52,191
Come in, come in.

151
01:36:52,327 --> 01:36:54,125
Mr Heep.

152
01:36:54,263 --> 01:36:58,133
Any friend of Copperfield's
is a friend of Wilkins Micawber.

153
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,910
(MICAWBER) My dear!
There is a gentleman here

154
01:37:08,052 --> 01:37:10,180
who wishes to be presented to you!

155
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:14,823
Copperfield, come to renew
his acquaintance with you, my love.

156
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:18,434
Lord, can it really be?

157
01:37:18,601 --> 01:37:22,061
Oh, what happy memories
of my youth!

158
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,708
Oh, here!

159
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,845
Oh, I...

160
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:30,011
You may perhaps have surmised

161
01:37:30,187 --> 01:37:34,592
that Mrs Micawber is in a state of health
which renders it not improbable

162
01:37:34,827 --> 01:37:38,356
that there will be soon be
an addition to the infantine group.

163
01:37:38,499 --> 01:37:40,195
In short, she is expecting.

164
01:37:40,336 --> 01:37:42,168
It is a happy event,

165
01:37:42,306 --> 01:37:46,608
though one that strains Mr Micawber's
already depleted resources.

166
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:51,047
But I know that he will,
as always, rise to the challenge.

167
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,555
We must celebrate.
Will you come to dinner next week?

168
01:37:54,759 --> 01:37:57,753
Oh! A noble and generous proposition.

169
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:04,198
<i>If I had listened to Agnes's advice,</i>

170
01:38:04,373 --> 01:38:07,435
<i>if I had never taken up
Steerforth's invitation,</i>

171
01:38:07,612 --> 01:38:11,380
<i>many honest lives would have
continued untouched by tragedy.</i>

172
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:15,651
<i>But I was blind to her wisdom then,
as I was blind to so many things,</i>

173
01:38:15,892 --> 01:38:18,020
<i>and it was with
nothing but joy in my heart</i>

174
01:38:18,195 --> 01:38:21,894
<i>that I went to visit my old friend
at the house he shared with his mother</i>

175
01:38:22,135 --> 01:38:24,604
<i>and her companion, Rosa Dartle.</i>

176
01:38:28,511 --> 01:38:31,812
James has told you he is
an Oxford man now, Mr Copperfield?

177
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:35,353
I am sure he will make you proud
and take a high degree.

178
01:38:35,489 --> 01:38:38,392
My dear Daisy, I doubt whether
I shall bother to take a degree at all

179
01:38:38,527 --> 01:38:41,464
Don't torment me, James.
You know you will

180
01:38:41,632 --> 01:38:44,227
There is no better mind
in the whole college.

181
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:48,034
You must forgive Mother.
She is quite horribly vain about me.

182
01:38:48,276 --> 01:38:50,643
But you give her
every reason to be, do you not?

183
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:54,582
We hardly see you, and surely that
can only be because you work so hard?

184
01:38:56,990 --> 01:39:01,656
Ah, good, the claret.
Daisy, this is Littimer, my manservant.

185
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:04,460
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, sir.

186
01:39:04,635 --> 01:39:07,538
I trust I find you well tonight.

187
01:39:07,673 --> 01:39:09,733
Very well, thank you.

188
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:13,014
How will you spend
your holiday, Mr Copperfield?

189
01:39:13,249 --> 01:39:17,278
I intend to visit my old nurse.
I haven't seen her in years.

190
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:20,153
Her brother lives in a boat
on Yarmouth Sands.

191
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,354
You remember him. He and his
nephew visited me at Creakle's once.

192
01:39:23,498 --> 01:39:26,731
I think I have some recollection.
Rustic types, weren't they?

193
01:39:26,904 --> 01:39:29,396
Their home is a magical place.
You really ought to see it.

194
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:31,636
Ought I? Well, why not?

195
01:39:31,878 --> 01:39:35,179
I have nothing else very pressing.
I'll come with you.

196
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:37,046
- Do you mean it?
- Certainly!

197
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:39,053
It might be amusing
to mix with that sort of people.

198
01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:43,595
But do tell me. "That sort of people".

199
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:47,132
Are they really animals and clods
and beings of another order?

200
01:39:47,369 --> 01:39:51,102
- I would so like to know.
- They're not as sensitive as we are.

201
01:39:51,342 --> 01:39:55,075
I dare say
they are wonderfully virtuous,

202
01:39:55,215 --> 01:39:57,207
but their natures are very coarse.

203
01:39:57,418 --> 01:40:00,878
Their delicacy is not to be
shocked or hurt very easily.

204
01:40:01,023 --> 01:40:04,894
Really? It's so consoling to find
that when they suffer, they don't feel!

205
01:40:05,998 --> 01:40:11,166
Sometimes I have been quite uneasy
for "that sort of people".

206
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:15,279
But now I shalljust dismiss
the idea of them altogether.

207
01:40:18,518 --> 01:40:20,510
(HARP BEING PLAYED)

208
01:40:25,596 --> 01:40:27,997
I was fascinated by Miss Dartle,

209
01:40:28,233 --> 01:40:32,194
and the strange hold
she had over Steerforth.

210
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,483
Don't stop, Rosa.

211
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:58,342
You haven't played for me in years.

212
01:41:26,192 --> 01:41:31,724
Come, Rosa. From now on
we shall love each other very much.

213
01:41:38,978 --> 01:41:41,972
- What happened?
- You have to be careful with Rosa.

214
01:41:42,117 --> 01:41:44,211
She is always dangerous.

215
01:41:46,523 --> 01:41:49,756
Have you noticed
that remarkable scar on her lip?

216
01:41:49,995 --> 01:41:51,861
Of course.

217
01:41:52,031 --> 01:41:54,001
I did that.

218
01:41:54,669 --> 01:41:56,900
I was a young boy
and she exasperated me,

219
01:41:57,039 --> 01:41:59,737
so I threw a hammer at her.

220
01:42:02,014 --> 01:42:05,543
What a promising young angel
I must have been!

221
01:42:19,909 --> 01:42:24,713
This is delightful, Daisy.
Just the tonic for a weary soul

222
01:42:25,718 --> 01:42:28,517
(DAVID) I don't believe you are
half as jaded as you say.

223
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:32,628
I don't believe you can possibly be
as honest and good as you pretend.

224
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:34,960
Not compared to you, at any rate.

225
01:42:36,669 --> 01:42:40,368
I'll see you back at the inn when
you've grown tired of being cried over.

226
01:42:56,466 --> 01:42:59,232
Does Mr Barkis still
go over to Blunderstone, ma'am?

227
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:02,500
He do, but he's bad abed
with the rheumatics.

228
01:43:02,643 --> 01:43:05,112
I want to see an old house.

229
01:43:06,984 --> 01:43:09,579
The Rookery, I think it's called.

230
01:43:13,627 --> 01:43:15,391
My darling boy!

231
01:43:15,631 --> 01:43:17,623
Peggotty!

232
01:43:22,407 --> 01:43:26,403
It's better than a pint of liniment
to see you again, Master Davy.

233
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:30,615
What was the name
I wrote up in the cart, sir?

234
01:43:30,854 --> 01:43:33,586
We had some grave talks
on that matter, didn't we?

235
01:43:33,825 --> 01:43:35,953
I was willing a long time.

236
01:43:36,095 --> 01:43:37,825
A long time, Mr Barkis.

237
01:43:39,568 --> 01:43:41,902
I don't regret it.

238
01:43:42,072 --> 01:43:47,570
C.P. Barkis is the usefullest
and the best of women.

239
01:43:47,781 --> 01:43:51,344
All the praise that anyone
could give C.P. Barkis

240
01:43:51,587 --> 01:43:54,615
she deserves, and more.

241
01:43:56,261 --> 01:43:58,992
I'm a poor man, sir.

242
01:43:59,132 --> 01:44:01,067
And I am sorry to hear it.

243
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,534
Very poor indeed.

244
01:44:05,709 --> 01:44:08,043
Old clothes.

245
01:44:08,213 --> 01:44:13,415
I wish it was full of money,
but it ain't. It's old clothes.

246
01:44:13,688 --> 01:44:15,054
I understand.

247
01:44:22,135 --> 01:44:25,163
Barkis has grown
a little nearer with time.

248
01:44:40,798 --> 01:44:44,793
<i>I remembered Mr Peggoty's boat
as a quiet, homely place,</i>

249
01:44:44,937 --> 01:44:46,997
<i>but as Steerforth and I approached,</i>

250
01:44:47,141 --> 01:44:50,909
<i>it soon became clear
that this was no ordinary night.</i>

251
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,312
(SHOUTING AND LAUGHTER
FROM INSIDE)

252
01:44:54,853 --> 01:44:57,049
(DAN) This is the happiest day
of my life!

253
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:01,388
Master Davy, it's Master Davy!

254
01:45:02,765 --> 01:45:05,292
(HAM) Master Davy!
(DAN) Davy boy!

255
01:45:06,839 --> 01:45:10,709
Mr Peggotty, this is Steerforth,
an old friend from school

256
01:45:10,878 --> 01:45:15,283
- You don't look a day older.
- Good to see you after so long.

257
01:45:15,452 --> 01:45:18,048
Why that you two
should come to this here roof

258
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:20,489
tonight of all nights of my life.

259
01:45:20,728 --> 01:45:23,664
What do you think, then?
What do you think?

260
01:45:23,898 --> 01:45:27,495
Only that this girl,
who I brought up from a baby,

261
01:45:27,672 --> 01:45:32,008
and loved better than a daughter,
only that she's going to be married!

262
01:45:32,145 --> 01:45:34,273
Emily!
(DAN LAUGHS)

263
01:45:34,515 --> 01:45:36,951
My warmest congratulations.

264
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:39,749
And who is the lucky fellow?

265
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:46,233
- Ham!
- Who else but Ham?

266
01:45:47,803 --> 01:45:50,034
Two years past, he asked her
and she comes to me

267
01:45:50,206 --> 01:45:52,369
and says she couldn't have him.

268
01:45:52,611 --> 01:45:55,514
"Him that I've known so intimately
all my life," she says.

269
01:45:55,682 --> 01:45:58,243
"And loved like a brother,
I can never have him."

270
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:00,512
And that was the end of it.

271
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:06,562
Until tonight, when he comes crying out
to me alljoyful, "She'll be my wife!"

272
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,465
And she says, "Yes, uncle. I've
changed me mind, if you please."

273
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:15,441
If I please!

274
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:18,446
I'd lay down my life for Emily.

275
01:46:18,585 --> 01:46:20,713
She's all to me that ever I can want.

276
01:46:20,955 --> 01:46:26,521
There ain't a gentlemen in all the land,
nor yet sailing upon the sea,

277
01:46:26,698 --> 01:46:30,227
that can love his lady
more than I love her.

278
01:46:30,437 --> 01:46:31,962
Ham.

279
01:46:32,941 --> 01:46:36,743
I give you joy. May you always
be as happy as you are tonight.

280
01:46:39,151 --> 01:46:41,848
<i>(STEERFORTH) He's
a chuckle-headed type for the girl</i>

281
01:46:42,055 --> 01:46:45,151
You're not with
Miss Dartle now, Steerforth.

282
01:46:45,327 --> 01:46:48,628
I could see for myself
how much you liked him.

283
01:46:48,799 --> 01:46:52,737
You see clean through me, Daisy.
I am defenceless against you.

284
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:11,091
Thank you.

285
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:54,697
Emily!

286
01:48:01,647 --> 01:48:05,517
I'm not good enough for Ham.
I'm cross and changeable with him

287
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:08,453
when he is never so to me.

288
01:48:08,591 --> 01:48:12,290
Why am I so often harsh when all
I should think of is making him happy?

289
01:48:12,397 --> 01:48:15,232
You do make him happy.
Anyone can see that.

290
01:48:15,302 --> 01:48:17,703
It would have been better
if he'd found someone else.

291
01:48:17,805 --> 01:48:19,934
Ham would rather die
than be with anyone but you.

292
01:48:20,076 --> 01:48:21,806
Don't say that!

293
01:48:21,979 --> 01:48:24,141
I'm not worthy of him!

294
01:48:24,383 --> 01:48:28,755
I should be a hundred times
more thankful for his goodness.

295
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:33,592
I should feel what a blessed thing it is
to be the wife of a good man

296
01:48:33,765 --> 01:48:35,427
and to lead a peaceful life.

297
01:48:35,601 --> 01:48:40,438
Once you are married, all these
worries and fears will fall away.

298
01:48:56,233 --> 01:48:59,762
- What do you think of her, Daisy?
- She's handsome enough. Why?

299
01:48:59,939 --> 01:49:02,067
I've just bought her.

300
01:49:02,209 --> 01:49:05,806
- But you might never come back.
- I don't know about that.

301
01:49:05,981 --> 01:49:08,543
I find I've taken a fancy to the place.

302
01:49:08,686 --> 01:49:10,621
She must be newly-rigged, though.

303
01:49:10,789 --> 01:49:14,249
I'm leaving Littimer behind
to see it done.

304
01:49:14,495 --> 01:49:18,627
I've decided to give her
a new name - "The Little Em'ly".

305
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:33,590
(DAVID) All she ever wanted
was to love and be loved in return.

306
01:49:33,725 --> 01:49:38,188
Think on the happy times, Davy.
Not what came after.

307
01:49:39,802 --> 01:49:43,638
<i>I felt many emotions
as I lingered by my mother's grave,</i>

308
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:47,610
<i>but it was the thought of Dora
that stirred me from my melancholy.</i>

309
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:52,710
<i>Reflecting on the past, I knew with
certainty that my future lay with her</i>

310
01:49:52,955 --> 01:49:56,859
<i>and that I could not rest
until I had declared myself.</i>

311
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:06,072
If your poor mother
could see you now,

312
01:50:06,243 --> 01:50:09,772
she'd be that vain her pretty head
would be completely turned.

313
01:50:17,394 --> 01:50:21,834
Goodbye, Peggotty. When I come back,
I'll have important news for you.

314
01:50:21,968 --> 01:50:24,700
- What news?
- I'm going to be married.

315
01:50:24,873 --> 01:50:27,342
Only the lady in question
doesn't know it yet.

316
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:31,745
- Who is she?
- Dora. Her name's Dora!

317
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:34,352
My darling boy!

318
01:50:36,557 --> 01:50:37,855
(COACHMAN) Go on!

319
01:50:53,150 --> 01:50:54,345
Steerforth?

320
01:50:54,486 --> 01:50:59,255
I wish to God I had had a judicious father
these last twenty years.

321
01:51:00,262 --> 01:51:04,291
I wish with all my soul
I had been better guided.

322
01:51:06,472 --> 01:51:08,134
I wish I could guide myself better.

323
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:11,608
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, Daisy, nothing.

324
01:51:12,948 --> 01:51:17,354
I am bad company for myself
sometimes, that is all

325
01:51:17,522 --> 01:51:20,891
If anything should ever separate us,

326
01:51:21,028 --> 01:51:25,525
you must promise me
that you'll think of me at my best.

327
01:51:25,702 --> 01:51:28,695
- Will you do that?
- Why should we ever be separated?

328
01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:31,239
Just promise me, can't you?

329
01:51:32,913 --> 01:51:35,906
Remember me at my best.

330
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:45,056
<i>Never more would I
touch his hand in friendship,</i>

331
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:49,763
<i>never more hear his laughter or feel
the warmth of his companionship.</i>

332
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:56,273
<i>May God forgive you, Steerforth.
I cannot.</i>

333
01:52:06,132 --> 01:52:07,498
My dear Copperfield!

334
01:52:08,602 --> 01:52:10,731
This is luxurious.

335
01:52:11,741 --> 01:52:17,580
A way of life which reminds me
of a period when I was myself a bachelor.

336
01:52:17,751 --> 01:52:21,154
Happy days, now, alas, gone forever.

337
01:52:21,323 --> 01:52:24,624
- Micawber! Have I deserved this?
- Deserved what?

338
01:52:24,862 --> 01:52:28,527
- You wish that we had never married.
- My love!

339
01:52:28,667 --> 01:52:30,499
This is my reward, Mr Copperfield!

340
01:52:30,637 --> 01:52:33,699
- I who will never desert him!
- Forgive me, Emma!

341
01:52:33,842 --> 01:52:37,610
I am a wife and mother,
and I swear I never will desert him.

342
01:52:37,782 --> 01:52:41,743
My dear, no one is urging you
to do anything of the sort, least of all me.

343
01:52:41,989 --> 01:52:45,893
- You don't regret our nuptial vows, then?
- Impossible! Unthinkable!

344
01:52:46,028 --> 01:52:47,690
Oh...

345
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:51,692
- Sit down, my dear.
- Yes.

346
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:54,432
Ah! Shall I do the honours,
Copperfield?

347
01:52:56,178 --> 01:53:00,480
Are you aware, Mr Copperfield,
that we are shortly to leave the metropolis

348
01:53:00,617 --> 01:53:03,179
to cast our lot among strangers?

349
01:53:03,355 --> 01:53:06,918
In short, Copperfield,
something has at last turned up.

350
01:53:08,163 --> 01:53:09,289
Where?

351
01:53:09,531 --> 01:53:12,661
I have recently
entered into arrangements

352
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:16,809
by virtue of which
I stand pledged and contracted

353
01:53:17,044 --> 01:53:20,982
as a confidential clerk
to a mutual friend.

354
01:53:21,217 --> 01:53:22,549
Heep.

355
01:53:23,754 --> 01:53:27,351
A man of remarkable
shrewdness and perspicacity.

356
01:53:27,594 --> 01:53:30,861
I am convinced
Micawber will flourish in a situation

357
01:53:31,066 --> 01:53:33,934
so suited to his fertile resources.

358
01:53:34,036 --> 01:53:38,442
I am sure he will be a judge,
or even a chancellor, one day.

359
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:44,218
To Copperfield,
the companion of my youth.

360
01:53:44,386 --> 01:53:48,257
And to Heep, my friend and protector.

361
01:53:52,432 --> 01:53:54,424
<i>The time had come to know my fate.</i>

362
01:53:54,602 --> 01:53:57,334
<i>I called on Dora at the first opportunity.</i>

363
01:53:59,043 --> 01:54:01,569
<i>Happiness or misery
was now the question,</i>

364
01:54:01,747 --> 01:54:04,013
<i>and only she
could give the answer to it.</i>

365
01:54:04,184 --> 01:54:06,244
Be quiet, you naughty boy!

366
01:54:06,488 --> 01:54:08,753
I came here today to tell you...

367
01:54:08,892 --> 01:54:10,724
Jip! Quiet, please!

368
01:54:11,863 --> 01:54:16,394
- I came here today to tell you...
- Jip, come back here! Bad boy!

369
01:54:17,438 --> 01:54:19,431
Mr Copperfield!

370
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:28,081
I came here today
to tell you that I love you.

371
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:32,256
I have loved you
since the first moment I saw you

372
01:54:32,495 --> 01:54:34,623
and I will always love you.

373
01:54:34,799 --> 01:54:37,668
- We hardly know each other!
- One minute was enough.

374
01:54:40,408 --> 01:54:42,377
I love you, Dora.

375
01:54:42,511 --> 01:54:44,571
With all my heart.

376
01:54:48,922 --> 01:54:51,255
Forgive me.

377
01:54:51,425 --> 01:54:53,987
I shall go now.

378
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:56,292
Please don't.

379
01:54:57,836 --> 01:54:59,304
Dora...

380
01:55:12,892 --> 01:55:15,988
Aunt! Mr Dick!

381
01:55:17,433 --> 01:55:19,026
I'm ruined.

382
01:55:21,874 --> 01:55:26,506
Betsey Trotwood - I don't mean
your sister, Trot, but myself -

383
01:55:26,747 --> 01:55:31,710
had a certain property and
for years that property did pretty well

384
01:55:32,022 --> 01:55:34,083
and returned good interest.

385
01:55:35,494 --> 01:55:38,624
But her man of business,

386
01:55:38,766 --> 01:55:41,601
being no longer the man
of business he once was,

387
01:55:41,738 --> 01:55:44,709
she took it into her head
to remove it from his hands

388
01:55:44,943 --> 01:55:47,003
and invest it for herself.

389
01:55:48,315 --> 01:55:52,447
First, she lost it in the mining way.

390
01:55:52,588 --> 01:55:55,218
Then she lost it
in the shipping and banking way.

391
01:55:56,327 --> 01:55:58,729
And finally, she lost the lot.

392
01:55:59,499 --> 01:56:02,163
And the least said about it,
soonest mended.

393
01:56:02,404 --> 01:56:06,570
- Is Mr Wickfield to blame for this?
- The blame is entirely my own.

394
01:56:08,146 --> 01:56:12,050
Well, the cottage is let
at 70 pounds per annum,

395
01:56:12,286 --> 01:56:14,221
which is all which we have to live on.

396
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:18,989
So here we are, my dear Trot.

397
01:56:19,131 --> 01:56:23,069
And you haven't a penny in the world!
What do you have to say to that?

398
01:56:23,203 --> 01:56:25,263
You know I've often
thought about writing.

399
01:56:25,406 --> 01:56:26,533
Mm?

400
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:30,169
I could work in the mornings
before I go to Doctor's Commons.

401
01:56:30,281 --> 01:56:36,052
- And I have 100 pounds a year.
- Which you should keep for yourself.

402
01:56:36,157 --> 01:56:41,097
- We must meet our reverses boldly.
- Boldly!

403
01:56:41,331 --> 01:56:44,734
Boldly. And not suffer them
to frighten us.

404
01:56:45,605 --> 01:56:51,240
We shall act the play out
and live misfortune down!

405
01:56:55,655 --> 01:56:59,115
- A beggar? Love a beggar?
- I am now a beggar.

406
01:56:59,294 --> 01:57:02,891
How can you be such a silly thing
and sit there telling stories?

407
01:57:03,066 --> 01:57:07,095
- I'll make Jip bite you.
- This must be our secret for now.

408
01:57:07,272 --> 01:57:10,732
I cannot speak to Mr Spenlow
about our engagement

409
01:57:10,911 --> 01:57:12,573
until I've begun to make my fortune.

410
01:57:12,714 --> 01:57:16,414
A secret engagement?
How romantic, Doady!

411
01:57:17,689 --> 01:57:19,282
When we are married,

412
01:57:19,525 --> 01:57:22,690
if our income is to be small,
we must try to be practical

413
01:57:22,864 --> 01:57:25,664
Please don't be practical
because it frightens me so.

414
01:57:25,802 --> 01:57:28,203
If you will sometimes
look at your papa's housekeeping

415
01:57:28,472 --> 01:57:30,100
and perhaps study cookery...

416
01:57:30,275 --> 01:57:33,246
You are determined
to frighten me out of my wits!

417
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:37,817
With perseverance and strength
of character, we can bear anything.

418
01:57:37,954 --> 01:57:40,925
But I haven't got
any strength. Have I, Jip?

419
01:57:41,827 --> 01:57:45,629
Oh, do kiss Jip
and stop being so disagreeable.

420
01:57:46,234 --> 01:57:48,567
Jip will have to wait his turn.

421
01:57:53,312 --> 01:57:57,114
I will feel happier when I've spoken
to Mr Wickfield about our situation.

422
01:57:57,285 --> 01:58:00,984
And no doubt you will be
glad of an excuse to see Agnes.

423
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:05,460
I can't feel comfortable until I know
her opinion of my engagement to Dora.

424
01:58:05,598 --> 01:58:09,696
Oh. So you imagine yourself
in love, do you?

425
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:11,305
Imagine?

426
01:58:11,473 --> 01:58:14,137
Yes, I suppose you think
you were made for each other,

427
01:58:14,378 --> 01:58:17,611
and are to go through
a children's party kind of life

428
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:20,744
like two pretty pieces of confectionary!

429
01:58:20,989 --> 01:58:23,185
Blind, Trot, blind!

430
01:58:23,326 --> 01:58:28,392
We are young and inexperienced,
I know, but we love one another truly.

431
01:58:28,534 --> 01:58:31,164
And she's neither silly
nor light-headed, I suppose?

432
01:58:31,405 --> 01:58:34,865
Dora is fascinating
and sweet and beautiful

433
01:58:35,812 --> 01:58:39,580
Blind, Trot, blind.

434
01:58:43,658 --> 01:58:45,354
<i>Returning to Canterbury,</i>

435
01:58:45,527 --> 01:58:49,465
<i>I felt Agnes's gentle influence
reaching out to me.</i>

436
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:53,333
<i>It seemed to pervade
even the city in which she dwelt.</i>

437
01:58:53,473 --> 01:58:56,035
<i>Yet as I approached
Mr Wickfield's house,</i>

438
01:58:56,177 --> 01:58:59,740
<i>my happiness gave way
to a growing sense of dread</i>

439
01:58:59,916 --> 01:59:02,283
<i>about what I might find within.</i>

440
01:59:09,732 --> 01:59:11,428
(DOOR BEING CLOSED)

441
01:59:12,569 --> 01:59:14,562
This is a bad business of your aunt.

442
01:59:14,807 --> 01:59:18,506
I came here to discover
if anything might be done.

443
01:59:18,646 --> 01:59:21,138
Nothing, Mr Copperfield,
nothing at all

444
01:59:21,316 --> 01:59:24,378
It's all gone
and no one is to blame but herself.

445
01:59:24,555 --> 01:59:29,120
She has been very reckless.
Isn't that right, Mr Wickfield?

446
01:59:29,263 --> 01:59:31,198
Quite right.

447
01:59:32,034 --> 01:59:36,939
You'll stay with us, Trotwood,
while you remain in Canterbury?

448
01:59:39,179 --> 01:59:42,742
Uriah is a great relief to me.

449
01:59:45,021 --> 01:59:49,119
It's a load of my mind
to have such a partner.

450
02:00:02,448 --> 02:00:05,044
My dear Copperfield!

451
02:00:05,220 --> 02:00:07,519
So how do you like the law,
Mr Micawber?

452
02:00:07,656 --> 02:00:09,784
It is a great pursuit, sir.

453
02:00:09,926 --> 02:00:13,125
To a man of higher imaginative powers
such as myself,

454
02:00:13,265 --> 02:00:17,671
it is perhaps over-reliant on detail

455
02:00:17,906 --> 02:00:23,814
A mind is not at liberty to soar
to any exalted forms of expression.

456
02:00:23,948 --> 02:00:26,282
Still, it is a great pursuit.

457
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:29,491
Do you see much of Mr Wickfield?

458
02:00:29,658 --> 02:00:33,096
Mr Wickfield is a man
of very excellent qualities...

459
02:00:34,499 --> 02:00:37,697
...but he is, in short, obsolete.

460
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:41,330
I am afraid his partner
seeks to make him so.

461
02:00:43,078 --> 02:00:45,571
My dear Copperfield.

462
02:00:45,716 --> 02:00:48,585
I am here in the capacity
of confidence and trust.

463
02:00:48,721 --> 02:00:53,889
The discussion of some topics,
even with Mrs Micawber herself,

464
02:00:54,063 --> 02:00:57,125
is incompatible with the functions
now devolving upon me.

465
02:00:57,335 --> 02:01:00,362
Do not ask, 'umble as I am,

466
02:01:00,607 --> 02:01:04,204
to speak of the affairs
of my friend Heep.

02:01:26,046 --> 02:01:27,776
(FOOTSTEPS)

468
02:01:30,787 --> 02:01:35,489
Wouldn't you say my Ury
is quite the gentleman these days, sir?

469
02:01:35,662 --> 02:01:37,961
Indeed, Mrs Heep.

470
02:01:41,871 --> 02:01:44,000
(WHISPERING)
How long has she been living here?

471
02:01:44,142 --> 02:01:47,340
- Months.
- Does she never leave you alone?

472
02:01:47,514 --> 02:01:50,450
It is certainly difficult
to avoid her company.

473
02:01:53,990 --> 02:01:59,158
My dear sister.
I have missed you so much lately.

474
02:01:59,299 --> 02:02:01,861
I wanted to talk to you
about Dora.

475
02:02:03,739 --> 02:02:05,833
We are to be married.

476
02:02:05,976 --> 02:02:07,877
She is the most wonderful girl
in the world

477
02:02:08,046 --> 02:02:11,074
and I know that you
will come to love her as well as I do.

478
02:02:11,251 --> 02:02:15,053
How could I not love anyone
who thinks so much of you?

479
02:02:15,190 --> 02:02:19,289
Promise not to abandon me
when I become an old, married man.

480
02:02:19,464 --> 02:02:21,592
You know how I rely on you.

481
02:02:21,867 --> 02:02:24,895
It is Dora you must rely on now.

482
02:02:26,508 --> 02:02:27,999
Of course.

483
02:02:28,144 --> 02:02:32,777
I will always be
your devoted friend and sister, Trot.

484
02:02:32,952 --> 02:02:37,084
Wherever our separate paths
may lead us, you may rely on that.

485
02:02:42,533 --> 02:02:44,695
(AGNES) Shall we retire, Mrs Heep?

486
02:02:52,249 --> 02:02:55,048
Father, go to bed soon.

487
02:03:08,808 --> 02:03:11,074
I'll give you a toast, gentlemen.

488
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:14,480
To the divinest of her sex.

489
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:21,695
I'm a 'umble individual
to give you her health,

490
02:03:21,862 --> 02:03:25,766
but I do admire, no, adore her.

491
02:03:25,902 --> 02:03:28,098
Choose some other toast, Uriah.

492
02:03:28,339 --> 02:03:31,742
Agnes Wickfield,
the divinest of her sex.

493
02:03:33,046 --> 02:03:36,142
Who else can propose it
if not the man who would be her husband?

494
02:03:36,418 --> 02:03:38,588
Never! Never!

495
02:03:38,588 --> 02:03:40,854
Have you gone mad, Wickfield?

496
02:03:43,763 --> 02:03:47,223
I have as good a right to her
as any other man.

497
02:03:48,537 --> 02:03:51,167
I have a better right
than any other man.

498
02:03:53,045 --> 02:03:55,947
Look at my torturer.

499
02:03:56,183 --> 02:03:59,677
Always at my elbow,
whispering his venom.

500
02:03:59,822 --> 02:04:02,155
In my house, in my business...

501
02:04:02,326 --> 02:04:06,355
Like a millstone around my neck,
bringing me to my ruin!

502
02:04:06,533 --> 02:04:08,468
Take care, Wickfield!

503
02:04:08,603 --> 02:04:12,006
Without me you would have
no house or business, nor reputation.

504
02:04:12,242 --> 02:04:15,941
(WICKFIELD WAILS)
Your safety is in my hands, remember?

505
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:20,286
Oh, what have I come to, Trotwood?

506
02:04:21,523 --> 02:04:25,461
My weak indulgence has ruined me.

507
02:04:26,797 --> 02:04:31,294
God knows what I have done
in my misery of oblivion!

508
02:04:51,469 --> 02:04:56,671
Have you ever picked a pear
before it was ripe, Mr Copperfield?

509
02:04:57,846 --> 02:04:59,371
What?

510
02:05:00,618 --> 02:05:03,349
I did that when
I spoke of Miss Agnes.

511
02:05:05,559 --> 02:05:07,460
But the pear will ripen yet.

512
02:05:11,335 --> 02:05:13,167
I can wait.

513
02:05:18,212 --> 02:05:21,911
There must be two parties
to a quarrel, Copperfield.

514
02:05:23,754 --> 02:05:25,780
And I won't be one.

515
02:05:38,377 --> 02:05:41,906
- Father is quite recovered.
- Is there nothing that can be done?

516
02:05:42,083 --> 02:05:46,579
His first words when he woke
were to send apologies to Uriah.

517
02:05:46,723 --> 02:05:49,421
- He is more in his power than ever.
- Promise me one thing.

518
02:05:49,662 --> 02:05:54,659
Promise me you will never sacrifice
yourself to a mistaken sense of duty.

519
02:05:55,838 --> 02:05:58,899
Agnes, you can't be
considering marriage to that...

520
02:06:00,245 --> 02:06:01,975
...reptile!

521
02:06:03,183 --> 02:06:05,311
Goodbye, Trotwood.

522
02:06:13,299 --> 02:06:15,632
<i>My return to London
was tormented by thoughts</i>

523
02:06:15,803 --> 02:06:17,829
<i>of the fate that lay in wait for Agnes.</i>

524
02:06:18,006 --> 02:06:22,537
<i>Little now stood between Heep
and the final success of his scheming.</i>

525
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,615
<i>It was with a heavy heart
that I made my way</i>

526
02:06:24,783 --> 02:06:27,583
<i>to Mr Spenlow's office
at the Doctor's Commons,</i>

527
02:06:27,722 --> 02:06:31,023
<i>only to find that
a further catastrophe awaited.</i>

528
02:06:31,761 --> 02:06:35,790
You have abused my confidence and
committed a dishonourable action!

529
02:06:35,901 --> 02:06:39,634
- I love Dora to such an extent...
- Miss Spenlow, if you please!

530
02:06:40,108 --> 02:06:44,342
And I beg that you won't
speak to me of love or engagements.

531
02:06:44,882 --> 02:06:48,411
My daughter is not
to be thrown away on a clerk!

532
02:06:49,021 --> 02:06:51,992
Now let there be
an end to this nonsense.

533
02:06:52,127 --> 02:06:55,690
Take these letters away
and throw them on the fire.

534
02:06:55,966 --> 02:06:59,495
You must forget her, Mr Copperfield!

535
02:07:13,326 --> 02:07:16,024
<i>Soon after this disastrous encounter,</i>

536
02:07:16,198 --> 02:07:21,332
<i>a letter arrived from Peggotty informing
me that Barkis was in a very poor way</i>

537
02:07:21,473 --> 02:07:25,036
<i>and she feared he would soon
be making his final journey.</i>

538
02:07:25,212 --> 02:07:27,477
<i>I resolved to go
to Yarmouth immediately,</i>

539
02:07:27,649 --> 02:07:31,748
<i>though not before attending
to the matter closest to my heart.</i>

540
02:07:34,026 --> 02:07:36,427
I'll never give Dora up

541
02:07:36,563 --> 02:07:39,659
and the sooner Mr Spenlow
knows that, the better.

542
02:07:41,103 --> 02:07:43,630
I'll see him this morning
on my way down.

543
02:08:06,143 --> 02:08:07,735
Mr Spenlow?

544
02:08:11,919 --> 02:08:13,478
Mr Spenlow?

545
02:08:21,935 --> 02:08:26,203
<i>Mr Spenlow's death from a heart
seizure threw everything into confusion.</i>

546

<i>I was desperate to see Dora,</i>

547
02:08:28,244 --> 02:08:32,411
<i>but she blamed her attachment to me
for her papa's untimely end.</i>

548
02:08:32,551 --> 02:08:34,713
She cannot see you, Mr Copperfield.

549
02:08:35,723 --> 02:08:40,185
The floodgates of sorrow are open
and her grief is not to be assuaged.

550
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:44,063
If I could just send her a note
or a token of my sympathy...

- How is he, Peggotty?
- He is fading fast.

554
02:09:04,835 --> 02:09:07,829
This is kind of you, Master Davy.

555
02:09:07,974 --> 02:09:09,442
Uncommon kind.

556
02:09:14,751 --> 02:09:20,249
Barkis, my dear. Here's Master Davy,
who brought us together!

557
02:09:23,465 --> 02:09:24,990
Old clothes!

558
02:09:26,370 --> 02:09:27,804
Old clothes...

He's going out with the tide.

560

People can't die along the coast,
except when the tide's pretty nigh out.

561
02:10:02,259 --> 02:10:04,160
Barkis, my dear.

C.P. Barkis.

563
02:10:11,006 --> 02:10:13,602
No better woman anywhere.

564
02:10:19,786 --> 02:10:23,019
Barkis is willing.

565
02:10:54,742 --> 02:11:00,411
I have looked over Mr Barkis's will
and opened the box.

566
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:06,124
- There was over 3,000 pounds inside.
- 3,000?!

567
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:10,356
He leaves the interest
on 1,000 to Mr Peggotty

568
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:13,231
and the rest goes to you.

How should I spend it without you?
Don't I want you now more than ever?

I know'd I was never wanted before,
and now I'm told so!

02:15:10,278 --> 02:15:14,046
I'm going to seek my niece.
That's my duty now.

608
02:15:20,326 --> 02:15:22,853
Why do you come here.
What do you want of me?

609
02:15:23,097 --> 02:15:25,897
I want to know if he will do
as he promised and marry her.

610
02:15:26,136 --> 02:15:27,627
Impossible.

611
02:15:27,772 --> 02:15:29,673
A marriage to someone
so far below him

612
02:15:29,808 --> 02:15:33,974
would destroy his career and
ruin his prospects. It will never happen.

613
02:15:34,916 --> 02:15:38,115
If there is any other compensation...

614
02:15:39,323 --> 02:15:44,765
You offer me money as compensation
for my niece's disgrace and ruin?

615
02:15:44,999 --> 02:15:47,969
What compensation can you make for
opening a pit between me and my son?

616
02:15:48,203 --> 02:15:51,436
What is your love to mine?
What is your separation to ours?

617
02:15:51,675 --> 02:15:54,976
My son has been
the object of my life.

618
02:15:55,515 --> 02:15:59,248
My every thought has been devoted
to him, his every wish indulged.

619
02:15:59,521 --> 02:16:02,651
And now he takes up
with a miserable beggar girl

620
02:16:02,860 --> 02:16:05,626
and repays my devotion
with deception.

621
02:16:05,965 --> 02:16:08,366
You speak of your injury?

622
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:12,473
I come here with no hope,
and I take none away.

623
02:16:13,377 --> 02:16:15,437
Good day, ma'am.

624
02:16:18,585 --> 02:16:20,178
You do well to bring him here!

625
02:16:20,254 --> 02:16:22,485
He's deeply injured,
though you don't seem to know it.

626
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:27,088
I would have his house torn down
and see her branded on the face!

627
02:16:27,232 --> 02:16:30,726
If I could hunt her
to the grave, I would do it.

628
02:16:37,415 --> 02:16:39,941
Chances are they're
in foreign parts by now.

629
02:16:40,185 --> 02:16:41,949
The sooner I go,
the quicker I'll find them.

630
02:16:42,189 --> 02:16:44,988
You know where I may be reached.

631
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:46,924
Look out for yourself, old girl

632
02:16:47,163 --> 02:16:51,830
I've got my garden and a little money
now, Dan. Don't worry about me.

633
02:16:52,004 --> 02:16:54,064
If any hurt should come to me,

634
02:16:54,241 --> 02:16:59,580
remember the last words I left for
my child were "love" and "forgiveness".

635
02:17:12,136 --> 02:17:13,900
(DOOR BEING CLOSED)
Aunt!

636
02:17:16,476 --> 02:17:17,944
You remember Peggotty?

637
02:17:18,078 --> 02:17:22,609
For the love of God, don't call her
by that South Sea island name!

638
02:17:22,786 --> 02:17:27,088
She married, didn't she?
What is your name now, Pegg...?

639
02:17:27,293 --> 02:17:29,455
Barkis, ma'am.

640
02:17:29,697 --> 02:17:31,495
You see, that's human.

641
02:17:32,234 --> 02:17:35,228
It sounds less as if
you needed a missionary.

642
02:17:36,641 --> 02:17:39,167
We are older than we were, I see.

643
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:44,977
How are you, Barkis?
I am heartily sorry for your loss.

644
02:17:45,989 --> 02:17:48,960
Thank you, ma'am. I'm quite well

645
02:17:52,666 --> 02:17:54,794
Oh, yes! Yes, Mr Dick.

646
02:17:57,774 --> 02:18:01,712
It came from Doctor's Commons
while you were away, Trot.

647
02:18:04,418 --> 02:18:06,910
The firm has collapsed
with heavy debts.

648
02:18:07,155 --> 02:18:11,026
Mr Spenlow was bankrupt.
There is nothing left.

649
02:18:11,896 --> 02:18:14,196
Does this mean
Miss Spenlow is destitute?

650
02:18:14,434 --> 02:18:16,767
- I must go to her.
- Oh, Trot!

651
02:18:17,004 --> 02:18:18,996
Oh, Mr Dick!

652
02:18:20,944 --> 02:18:24,143
Shh... That's all right.

653
02:18:25,985 --> 02:18:27,954
It's all right.

654
02:18:28,089 --> 02:18:30,388
I shall take care of you now.

655
02:18:32,629 --> 02:18:35,191
You are still mine, aren't you, Dora?

656
02:18:36,736 --> 02:18:38,465
Of course I am!

657
02:18:39,673 --> 02:18:42,075
It's just that I am so frightened!

658
02:18:43,646 --> 02:18:45,707
There's no need to be afraid.

659
02:18:45,884 --> 02:18:47,944
But we have nothing!

660
02:18:49,122 --> 02:18:51,489
We have everything.

661
02:19:07,584 --> 02:19:11,283
<i>I took with fear
and trembling to authorship.</i>

662
02:19:11,456 --> 02:19:14,427
<i>I wrote a little something
and sent it to a magazine.</i>

663
02:19:14,595 --> 02:19:16,063
<i>It was published.</i>

664
02:19:16,231 --> 02:19:19,168
<i>I wrote more and quickly began
to make a steady income,</i>

665
02:19:19,303 --> 02:19:23,036
<i>enough for Dora and I
to contemplate the future with optimism.</i>

666
02:19:29,052 --> 02:19:31,214
(COACHMAN) Whoa!

667
02:19:34,126 --> 02:19:37,062
I have forgotten what relation
Agnes is to you, Doady.

668
02:19:37,230 --> 02:19:41,761
No blood relation, but we were
brought up like brother and sister.

669
02:19:44,977 --> 02:19:46,377
Dora.

670
02:19:52,455 --> 02:19:55,426
Agnes is so warm and kind.

671
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:57,722
I was quite frightened of her before,

672
02:19:57,896 --> 02:20:01,459
but now I feel so calm
and peaceful in her company.

673
02:20:01,602 --> 02:20:04,505
I wonder that you
ever fell in love with me.

674
02:20:04,674 --> 02:20:07,236
How could I see you
and not love you?

675
02:20:08,346 --> 02:20:11,215
Don't you think that if I had been
her friend a long time ago,

676
02:20:11,351 --> 02:20:13,343
I might perhaps
have been more clever?

677
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:17,121
You would prefer me
if I was, wouldn't you?

678
02:20:17,293 --> 02:20:21,232
- What nonsense!
- Is it, Doady? Are you sure?

679
02:20:39,595 --> 02:20:41,587
<i>And so we were married.</i>

680
02:20:41,765 --> 02:20:45,066
<i>The bridesmaids were gone
and the celebrations were over,</i>

681
02:20:45,204 --> 02:20:48,664
<i>and Dora and I
were left alone at last.</i>

682
02:20:55,454 --> 02:20:57,515
Are you happy now, you foolish boy?

683
02:21:09,542 --> 02:21:12,274
But Doady, what shall I do with this?

684
02:21:12,814 --> 02:21:14,248
Jump, Jip.

685
02:21:14,383 --> 02:21:16,853
My love, do you think Mary Anne
has any idea of time?

686
02:21:16,988 --> 02:21:20,391
- Why, Doady?
- Dinner should be at five. It is now six.

687
02:21:21,528 --> 02:21:25,262
<i>I doubt whether two young birds could
have known less about keeping house</i>

688
02:21:25,401 --> 02:21:29,305
<i>than I and my pretty wife did, for the
same thing happened again and again.</i>

689
02:21:29,441 --> 02:21:30,773
- Don't!
- Why not?

690
02:21:30,910 --> 02:21:34,541
- She looks so tired, poor thing.
- Tired? She's drunk!

691
02:21:34,649 --> 02:21:37,779
But she has so many children,
who are a great trial to her.

692
02:21:43,763 --> 02:21:46,495
- Would you carve, Mr Micawber?
- No, no, no.

693
02:21:49,873 --> 02:21:53,777
<i>My pride at hosting
our first dinner together knew no limits,</i>

694
02:21:53,913 --> 02:21:58,147
<i>but alas, the outcome was not
the triumph I had anticipated.</i>

695
02:22:01,524 --> 02:22:05,327
Mutton should always be rare.

696
02:22:10,873 --> 02:22:13,035
Perhaps we should start
with the oysters.

697
02:22:13,210 --> 02:22:17,582
I'm afraid there's something the matter
with them. They don't seem right.

698
02:22:18,685 --> 02:22:20,779
There's nothing wrong.

699
02:22:21,456 --> 02:22:25,224
Capital oysters, in fact.
Only, they have never been opened.

700
02:22:26,164 --> 02:22:31,332
All that is required
for a delightful repast is an oyster knife.

701
02:22:33,041 --> 02:22:34,839
(MICAWBER) No? No matter.

702
02:22:39,517 --> 02:22:43,148
How does Micawber
seem to you, Mr Copperfield?

703
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:45,226
A little subdued, perhaps.

704
02:22:45,728 --> 02:22:49,359
He is entirely reserved.
He is secret.

705
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:51,833
He has become severe
to his children

706
02:22:52,004 --> 02:22:55,134
and even looks with an eye of coldness
on the unoffending little stranger

707
02:22:55,276 --> 02:22:57,268
recently added to our familial circle.

708
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:59,540
It's hard to bear.

709
02:23:00,617 --> 02:23:03,918
Mr Micawber is not the same
since he fell in with Uriah Heep!

Soup, perhaps?

713

Soup?

Oh, dear...

<i>(BETSEY) You must have
patience with her, Trot.</i>

716
02:23:18,011 --> 02:23:20,641
Just a few words here and there.

717
02:23:20,816 --> 02:23:23,616
Teach her
a little firmness, you mean?

718
02:23:24,488 --> 02:23:26,650
Don't ask me such a thing, Trot.

719
02:23:26,893 --> 02:23:28,657
The outcome would only be failure,

720
02:23:28,896 --> 02:23:31,229
misery for Dora,
and division between us.

<i>(BETSEY) Judge her by the qualities
she has, not by those she lacks.</i>

<i>I was content
to heed my aunt's advice,</i>

<i>but the happiness I had once
anticipated for myself eluded me,</i>

<i>and there was always
something wanting.</i>

725

<i>I had no equal partner
in the toils and cares of our life.</i>

<i>Yet my decision
to adapt myself to Dora</i>

727

<i>made our second year
much happier than our first,</i>

<i>and when I learnt
that she was expecting a child,</i>

<i>it seemed our joy
might yet be complete.</i>

<i>But already, dark clouds
had begun to gather around us.</i>

731
02:24:06,187 --> 02:24:09,158
You may go up now. She's resting.

732
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:12,228
She might still have a child one day?

733
02:24:12,398 --> 02:24:15,027
Your wife is very weak,
Mr Copperfield.

734
02:24:17,339 --> 02:24:21,835
When I can run about again,
I shall make Jip race with me.

735
02:24:23,148 --> 02:24:26,881
You are getting quite slow and lazy.

He has a worse disorder
than laziness, my dear.

Oh, poor Jip!

How strange that he should be old.
Even little Jip.

740
02:24:41,109 --> 02:24:45,310
Let Jip have his rest.
I'll give you another dog to race with.

741
02:24:45,483 --> 02:24:47,714
Oh, I couldn't have any other dog.

742

You are not so old, Jip, are you,
that you'll leave your mistress yet?

We may still keep each other
company a little longer.

We shall both be running about
again soon, as we used to do.

- A month.

And still no news?

750
02:25:21,707 --> 02:25:25,645
If she were ever to leave him, London
is where she'd come to lose herself.

751
02:25:25,779 --> 02:25:29,046
These are the places

If you need me, sir,
send word here.

755
02:25:44,376 --> 02:25:50,147
Many a time in me sleep,
I heard her cry out, "Uncle!"

756
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:53,050
And fall like death before me.

757

Many a time I raised her up

02:25:58,665 --> 02:26:03,833
"Emily, my dear.
I am come for to bring forgiveness,

759
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:06,100
"and to take you home."

760
02:26:12,853 --> 02:26:14,879
I sent for you because there is news.

761
02:26:15,057 --> 02:26:18,460
She has run away.
Tell him what you know.

762
02:26:18,596 --> 02:26:22,626
Mr Steerforth and myself have been
abroad with the young woman

763
02:26:22,769 --> 02:26:26,332
ever since she left Yarmouth
under his protection.

764
02:26:26,575 --> 02:26:29,637
She was much admired
wherever we went.

765
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:33,682
The whole thing lasted longer
than anyone might have expected,

766
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:37,019
but, at last, Mr Steerforth grew restless

767
02:26:37,158 --> 02:26:41,427
and charged me with breaking the news
to the young woman that he was gone.

768
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:45,738
Mr Steerforth proposed
that the young woman should marry

769
02:26:45,905 --> 02:26:50,971
a very respectable person who was
fully prepared to overlook the past.

770
02:26:51,147 --> 02:26:54,448
- You!
- Her conduct was surprisingly bad.

771
02:26:55,321 --> 02:26:58,223
- She showed no gratitude at all
- Get him out of here.

772
02:26:58,358 --> 02:27:02,263
This low girl he picked
out of the tide mud may be dead.

773
02:27:02,399 --> 02:27:06,599
If not, it is in both our interests
that she be found.

774
02:27:06,738 --> 02:27:08,536
She must not be allowed
to prey on him again.

775
02:27:08,708 --> 02:27:11,440
You wrong her most grievously.

776
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:14,275
Is he informed of everything, Rosa?

777
02:27:14,518 --> 02:27:18,320
Then there is nothing else
to detain you here, Mr Copperfield.

some reputation as a writer now.

I find my name
connected with a little praise.

780
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:31,806
It is a pity you have no mother.
She would have been proud of you.

781
02:27:41,593 --> 02:27:44,462
Do you mind if I say
something very, very silly?

Go to the inn in Buckingham Street
and ask for a Mr Peggotty.

Which, in truth, Heep took out himself
with a forged signature.

02:39:28,172 --> 02:39:31,473
Ever since, he has
used this supposed criminal act

No, my son will be 'umble,

02:40:04,463 --> 02:40:06,694
Where is my property?

899
02:40:06,833 --> 02:40:10,635
Blame Mr Wickfield
for mishandling it, would you?

900
02:40:10,805 --> 02:40:14,574

Your money is quite safe, Aunt.

902
02:40:23,025 --> 02:40:26,623
I only took her money
to ruin you, Copperfield.

903
02:40:26,798 --> 02:40:29,199
I have always hated you.

904
02:40:29,769 --> 02:40:32,604
You've always been against me
and my love for Agnes.

905
02:40:32,774 --> 02:40:34,538
Love?

906
02:40:34,677 --> 02:40:38,376

forced me into a marriage I didn't want,

- Yes.

02:40:55,276 --> 02:40:58,213
- Shall I go now?
- Post-haste, Mr Dick.

912
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:07,017
Running is futile.

913
02:41:07,261 --> 02:41:09,492
You have nowhere to go.

914
02:41:13,839 --> 02:41:16,570
I shall send for my family immediately.

915
02:41:16,709 --> 02:41:20,408
The veil that has long been interposed
between Mrs Micawber and myself

916
02:41:20,549 --> 02:41:22,609
is now withdrawn.

917
02:41:22,853 --> 02:41:25,949
And my children
and the author of their being

918
02:41:26,158 --> 02:41:29,094
can once more meet on equal terms.

919
02:41:32,234 --> 02:41:36,196
Mr Micawber. It seems
you are in need of a fresh start.

920
02:41:36,374 --> 02:41:37,636
Indeed, madam.

921
02:41:37,877 --> 02:41:41,315
I wonder if you have ever

922
02:41:41,582 --> 02:41:46,112
turned your mind to emigration?

923
02:41:46,356 --> 02:41:48,349
It was the dream of my youth.

924
02:41:48,593 --> 02:41:50,118
Why not go now?

925
02:41:50,363 --> 02:41:54,324
Capital, madam, or rather
the lack of it, is the issue.

926
02:41:54,502 --> 02:41:57,905
You have done us a great service.

927
02:41:58,141 --> 02:42:00,873
What if we were to find you
the capital in return?

928
02:42:04,351 --> 02:42:06,445
I could not take it as a gift.

929
02:42:07,356 --> 02:42:12,854
But if a sufficient sum could be
advanced at five per cent per annum...

930
02:42:13,099 --> 02:42:15,660
It shall be done in any way you wish.

931
02:42:16,838 --> 02:42:19,239
One question arises.

932
02:42:20,110 --> 02:42:23,081
Are the circumstance of the country such
that a man of Micawber's abilities

933
02:42:23,248 --> 02:42:26,879
would have a fair chance
of rising in the social scale?

934
02:42:27,588 --> 02:42:31,151
I will not say, "Might he aspire
to be Governor?" at present...

935
02:42:31,327 --> 02:42:35,630
- There is no better opening anywhere.
- No better.

936
02:42:36,768 --> 02:42:38,031
No better.

937
02:42:38,271 --> 02:42:42,677
Then it is evident that Australia
is the legitimate sphere of action for him!

938
02:42:51,325 --> 02:42:53,726
<i>Passage was booked
for the Micawbers</i>

939
02:42:53,896 --> 02:42:56,628
<i>and suddenly it was time
to say farewell</i>

940
02:42:57,501 --> 02:43:00,063
(DAVID) Mr Micawber?

941
02:43:00,239 --> 02:43:02,231
You look very well equipped,
Mr Micawber.

942
02:43:02,376 --> 02:43:06,782
We have abandoned the luxuries
of the old country, Copperfield.

943
02:43:06,917 --> 02:43:08,977
Forest dwellers such as ourselves

944
02:43:09,153 --> 02:43:13,490
cannot expect to participate in
the refinements of the land of the free.

945
02:43:13,661 --> 02:43:17,064
I am sure there are towns
of some description in Australia,

946
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:19,499
but I feel it wise to be prepared.

947
02:43:19,670 --> 02:43:21,605
- Wilkins Micawber?
- Yes.

948
02:43:21,806 --> 02:43:23,536
I have a warrant for your arrest

949
02:43:23,776 --> 02:43:27,408
on a matter of non-payment
of certain outstanding bills.

950
02:43:28,083 --> 02:43:30,211
All hope is extinguished!

951
02:43:30,386 --> 02:43:32,218
Convey my family to the workhouse

952
02:43:32,423 --> 02:43:35,087
and forget that a being
such as I ever lived.

953
02:43:35,228 --> 02:43:39,895
- We shall never leave without you!
- What is the value of the bills?

954
02:43:40,135 --> 02:43:42,331
Nine pounds,
nineteen shillings and sixpence.

955
02:43:42,572 --> 02:43:44,507
Ha! A mere trifle.

956
02:43:56,527 --> 02:44:00,864
(MICAWBER) A noble gesture, ma'am,
that will be repaid, with interest.

957
02:44:01,602 --> 02:44:02,865
Thank you, ma'am.

958
02:44:05,475 --> 02:44:09,005
Copperfield. The time has come
for us to take our leave.

959
02:44:09,148 --> 02:44:13,348
- There will be no speeches on my part.
- I don't believe a word of it.

960
02:44:13,521 --> 02:44:17,220
I say, there will be
no speeches from me.

961
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:20,229
Only, in short...

962
02:44:21,434 --> 02:44:23,665
...farewell, old friend.

963
02:44:27,543 --> 02:44:29,774
God go with you, Mr Micawber.

964
02:44:30,515 --> 02:44:33,041
God go with all of you.

965
02:44:33,653 --> 02:44:35,952
(MICAWBER) Come on, we must board.

966
02:44:40,163 --> 02:44:41,495
(MR DICK) Bye!

967
02:44:42,233 --> 02:44:44,566
- Bye.
- Bye.

968
02:44:44,804 --> 02:44:46,932
Bye. Bye.

969
02:44:47,175 --> 02:44:49,167
Bye-bye!

970
02:44:50,245 --> 02:44:51,873
Thank you!

971
02:44:54,286 --> 02:44:58,418
<i>Mr Micawber and his family
were not alone on their journey that day.</i>

972
02:44:58,559 --> 02:45:02,429
<i>The time had also come
to say goodbye to other old friends.</i>

973
02:45:02,565 --> 02:45:06,937
<i>Fearful for Emily's health, Peggotty
insisted that the news of Ham's death</i>

974
02:45:07,106 --> 02:45:10,509
<i>should be kept from her
until she was stronger.</i>

975
02:45:10,778 --> 02:45:12,474
We'll start a new life together.

976
02:45:12,714 --> 02:45:14,740
It is so good to see you well again.

977
02:45:16,755 --> 02:45:20,591
When you gave Ham my letter,
did he say anything?

978
02:45:20,827 --> 02:45:22,762
His love is with you always.

979
02:45:23,631 --> 02:45:26,761
And forgiveness?
Did he send forgiveness?

980
02:45:27,003 --> 02:45:28,905
With all his heart.

981
02:45:30,610 --> 02:45:32,545
I did ask this one to come with us,

982
02:45:32,679 --> 02:45:35,410
but you see, she's that fond of you
and your, Master Davy,

983
02:45:35,583 --> 02:45:37,518
that it wouldn't be
hardly fair to let her go.

984
02:45:37,654 --> 02:45:40,886
I told him straight out,
"My place is here now, Davy."

985
02:45:41,026 --> 02:45:43,086
(STEWARD) Passengers on board!

986
02:45:54,113 --> 02:45:55,604
(WAILING)

987
02:45:55,782 --> 02:46:00,188
Will I ever see my little boy again?

988
02:46:04,129 --> 02:46:08,831
Be 'umble, Ury, as you always was!

989
02:46:50,903 --> 02:46:53,634
I was dreaming a moment ago.

990
02:46:55,109 --> 02:46:58,274
I thought we were in the park again.

991
02:46:59,683 --> 02:47:02,346
Walking together arm in arm.

992
02:47:04,791 --> 02:47:06,726
It was so pleasant.

993
02:47:09,298 --> 02:47:11,700
I am quite sad to wake up.

994
02:47:12,670 --> 02:47:16,506
Don't be sad. We'll go there again soon.

995
02:47:19,414 --> 02:47:21,110
Doady, dear.

996
02:47:23,621 --> 02:47:28,219
I am afraid
I was too young to be married.

997
02:47:28,829 --> 02:47:30,593
Don't say such things.

998
02:47:32,802 --> 02:47:35,328
I was such a silly little creature.

999
02:47:38,277 --> 02:47:40,644
I think it might have been better

1000
02:47:40,814 --> 02:47:47,053
if we had only loved each other
as boy and girl, and then forgotten it.

1001
02:47:49,561 --> 02:47:52,555
I don't think I was fit to be a wife.

1002
02:47:52,699 --> 02:47:56,501
- As fit as I to be a husband.
- Perhaps.

1003
02:47:58,241 --> 02:48:00,370
But you are clever...

1004
02:48:02,048 --> 02:48:06,180
...and I never was, and never could be.

1005
02:48:07,623 --> 02:48:09,455
We have been happy, Dora.

1006
02:48:09,693 --> 02:48:12,026
Very happy.

1007
02:48:13,465 --> 02:48:18,599
But as the years went on,
you would have wearied of your little wife.

1008
02:48:20,643 --> 02:48:24,172
I would have tried,
and disappointed you.

1009
02:48:25,418 --> 02:48:29,220
And you might not have been
able to love me half so well as now.

1010
02:48:29,357 --> 02:48:34,457
Do not speak to me so.
Every word seems a reproach.

1011
02:48:34,632 --> 02:48:37,694
I love you too much
for reproachful words.

1012
02:48:40,041 --> 02:48:44,810
It's the only merit I have,
except being pretty.

1013
02:48:46,919 --> 02:48:49,445
Oh, how my poor boy cries.

1014
02:48:55,699 --> 02:48:58,134
Will you ask Agnes
to come up, Doady?

1015
02:49:00,673 --> 02:49:04,202
I want to speak to her quite alone.

1016
02:49:16,532 --> 02:49:21,871
Don't cry, Doady.
It is better as it is.

1017
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:47,904
Not tonight, Jip. Not tonight.

1018
02:50:44,837 --> 02:50:48,833
<i>I went as far away as I could,
not knowing, even then,</i>

1019
02:50:49,011 --> 02:50:52,642
<i>how great the shock was
that I had to bear.</i>

1020
02:50:52,816 --> 02:50:56,219
<i>A long and gloomy night
gathered about me,</i>

1021
02:50:56,422 --> 02:51:02,524
<i>haunted by the ghosts of many hopes,
many errors, many sorrows and regrets.</i>

1022
02:51:04,669 --> 02:51:06,763
<i>Agnes wrote to me often.</i>

1023
02:51:06,939 --> 02:51:10,900
<i>She gave me no advice,
she urged no duty on me.</i>

1024
02:51:11,045 --> 02:51:14,107
<i>She only told me
what her trust in me was,</i>

1025
02:51:14,250 --> 02:51:18,883
<i>how a nature such as mine
would turn affliction to good.</i>

1026
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:28,369
<i>But I mourned for Dora, taken so
young from the world she loved.</i>

1027
02:51:28,506 --> 02:51:33,172
<i>For Steerforth, who might have won
the love and admiration of thousands</i>

1028
02:51:33,313 --> 02:51:36,113
<i>as all those years ago
he had won mine.</i>

1029
02:51:36,251 --> 02:51:41,920
<i>And for broken- hearted Ham, who
found peace at last in the stormy sea.</i>

1030
02:51:47,035 --> 02:51:52,533
<i>I worked early and late, patiently and
hard, until my first book was finished.</i>

1031
02:51:52,677 --> 02:51:57,879
<i>It was published and was successful
I began another immediately.</i>

1032
02:52:05,865 --> 02:52:08,734
<i>Three years passed in this way.</i>

1033
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:13,833
<i>I might have gone on the same forever,
but one day I looked up from my work</i>

1034
02:52:14,011 --> 02:52:16,913
<i>and suddenly I knew
it was time to return.</i>

1035
02:52:17,116 --> 02:52:21,521
<i>It was as though I could hear
a voice calling me home.</i>

1036
02:52:21,689 --> 02:52:23,590
<i>Agnes's voice.</i>

1037
02:52:28,634 --> 02:52:30,364
Thank you, Peggotty.

1038
02:52:31,038 --> 02:52:33,064
What will you do now, Trot?

1039
02:52:33,241 --> 02:52:36,371
I thought I might ride over
to Canterbury tomorrow.

1040
02:52:36,513 --> 02:52:40,383
- Is Mr Wickfield well.
- A better man in all respects.

1041
02:52:40,519 --> 02:52:42,385
A reclaimed man.

1042
02:52:42,522 --> 02:52:47,019
- And Agnes?
- As good and beautiful as always.

1043
02:52:48,833 --> 02:52:51,234
Has she any admirers?

1044
02:52:52,371 --> 02:52:53,703
Dozens.

1045
02:52:53,941 --> 02:52:56,103
D-d-dozens.

1046
02:52:58,380 --> 02:53:03,514
- But is anyone worthy of her?
- I suspect she has an attachment.

1047
02:53:07,696 --> 02:53:10,791
I think she is going to be married.

1048
02:53:13,471 --> 02:53:15,997
<i>(AGNES) Will you go away again.?</i>

1049
02:53:16,142 --> 02:53:19,876
<i>(DAVID) Perhaps. There is
little enough to hold me here.</i>

1050
02:53:21,417 --> 02:53:24,478
You have a secret.
Let me share it.

1051
02:53:24,655 --> 02:53:28,560
- A secret?
- There is someone close to your heart.

1052
02:53:28,695 --> 02:53:31,996
My aunt told me. Confide in me.

1053
02:53:33,235 --> 02:53:37,834
Let me be your friend and brother
in this as in so many other things.

1054
02:53:40,748 --> 02:53:43,684
- What have I done?
- I am not myself.

1055
02:53:43,885 --> 02:53:45,649
Don't speak to me now.
We'll talk later.

1056
02:53:45,789 --> 02:53:47,951
If you have a burden,
let me lighten it.

1057
02:53:48,126 --> 02:53:49,788
I must go.

1058
02:53:49,929 --> 02:53:53,992
If you have a lover, you can tell me.

1059
02:53:54,135 --> 02:53:58,040
The attachment I have is not
a new one. It is not what you suppose.

1060
02:53:58,275 --> 02:54:03,044
I cannot reveal it! It has long been mine
and must remain mine.

1061
02:54:04,751 --> 02:54:06,447
Agnes...

1062
02:54:08,825 --> 02:54:11,056
You love me?

I have loved you all my life.

1064
02:54:16,971 --> 02:54:21,070
- For God's sake, let me go.
- What have I ever been without you?

1065
02:54:21,311 --> 02:54:24,544
- You mean as a sister?
- No.

1066
02:54:24,717 --> 02:54:27,380
Much more than that.

1067
02:54:28,556 --> 02:54:34,293
I went away loving you,
I stayed away loving you,

1068
02:54:34,466 --> 02:54:38,734
and I have returned home loving you.

1069

Do you remember how Dora
sent for me the night that she died?

1070
02:55:08,252 --> 02:55:10,551
She made me
promise something to her.

1071
02:55:10,722 --> 02:55:12,589
What was it?

1072
02:55:13,527 --> 02:55:19,561
She told me that only I could occupy
this empty space in your heart.

1076
02:56:05,409 --> 02:56:07,742
Maybe things were a little hard at first,

1077
02:56:07,912 --> 02:56:12,614
but what with sheep farming
and one thing and another,

1078
02:56:12,753 --> 02:56:14,949
we are as well to do as well could be.

And Emily?

1080
02:56:17,694 --> 02:56:20,529
She might have married
any number of times.

1081
02:56:20,699 --> 02:56:24,899
"But Uncle," she says to me,
"that's gone forever."

1082
02:56:26,608 --> 02:56:28,440
That's my Emily.

you might recall, sir.
