00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,541
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer...

3
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,500
in... um...

4
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,420
In Sumeria.

5
00:00:56,463 --> 00:00:59,543
And what happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

6
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:02,542
Jesus' disciples
performed miracles.

7
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:05,481
When Simon Magus
saw the miracles...

8
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:08,381
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

9
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,264
How did Peter respond...

10
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,742
John Rossi?

11
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,224
Stand up!

12
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,666
Answer my question, John Rossi.

13
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:27,025
That's not my name.

14
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,546
You and all
the other bastards...

15
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,146
lucky enough to be here...

16
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:35,586
children of sin,
spawn of the damned...

17
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:39,185
are all named for saints...

18
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:43,588
saints who are disciplined,
saints who are chaste.

19
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:47,828
You are named
for John Baptist Rossi...

20
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:50,867
a Capuchin priest who
gave away all his possessions.

21
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,588
A man who had nothing,
like you.

22
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:58,109
Now what is your name...

23
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,272
you ungrateful cur?

24
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,191
Your name, boy!

25
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,912
Have you lost your tongue?

26
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,752
What is your name?

27
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:30,872
All the girls...

28
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,474
will remain locked
in their dormitory...

29
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:37,714
and no food
will be served to any boy...

30
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:42,273
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,478
Food! Food! Food!
Food! Food! Food! Food!

32
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,564
Yes. Yes.

33
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:57,004
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

34
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,408
No.

35
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,806
Simon... Templar.

36
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,966
Agnes!

37
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:16,046
Agnes!

38
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,406
Agnes!

39
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,410
Agnes!

40
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,290
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

41
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,610
Won't happen,
'cause we're leaving tonight...

42
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,208
this hearty brotherhood,
on a crusade.

43
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,531
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love...

44
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,212
to bid you farewell.

45
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,651
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss.

46
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,773
Hey, watch this.

47
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,454
We've lost some girls!

48
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:17,894
The girls are missing!

49
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,933
There are girls missing!

50
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,134
Come on, boys!

51
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:32,056
Wait, John Rossi.
My kiss.

52
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:39,856
There he is! Get him!

53
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,938
Aah!

54
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,819
October 3.

55
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,060
Entering foyer
of Tretiak industries.

56
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,539
Heavy security on elevators.
Guards in uniform.

57
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,980
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate passkey.

58
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,341
Maybe use stairs.

59
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,463
No traffic there.

60
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,343
October 4.

61
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:19,867
Personal tidbits.

62
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:23,381
Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.

63
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,384
It left Tretiak as sole owner
of a gas and oil empire.

64
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:31,622
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

65
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:34,465
Who are you?

66
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:36,863
Vehicle was
driven by younger son Ilya...

67
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,104
now 27.

68
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,786
Wife now lives in Geneva...

69
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,626
following assassination
attempt in 1996.

70
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,684
I am... Ivanovanovitch.

71
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,707
October 5.

72
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,786
Ilya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado...

73
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,906
with bandito buddies.

74
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:52,986
Gangster rap, coffee,
flirting with teenage girls.

75
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,344
Small firearms in coats.
Machine pistols in cars.

76
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:15,038
There were
three great empires...

77
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,797
that dominated the world both
culturally and militarily...

78
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,118
Rome, Constantinople,
and Russia.

79
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,998
All three have fallen.

80
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,398
Only one can be restored...

81
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:34,238
and only one man
can restore it...

82
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:37,039
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

83
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:02,760
Friends...
countrymen...

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,521
Russians!

85
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:15,124
You people
here in this room...

86
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:18,326
are the cream of Russia...

87
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:23,725
and the whole nation
is listening with us.

88
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:27,168
But why do you all
listen to me rave?

89
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,166
Set aside my oil company...

90
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,766
forget about
my best-selling book...

91
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:36,245
and all I am is a lunatic...

92
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,927
haunted by the fantasy
of an empire...

93
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:44,168
that reclaims her former might,
her former size.

94
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:54,128
All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of a Russia...

95
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:59,011
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth.

96
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:04,889
Not ridiculed, but revered.

97
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,691
No! More than revered!

98
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,132
Feared!

99
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:24,572
But who am I
to dazzle you with this dream?

100
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,812
All I've done is...

101
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,735
How does it look
for the leader's son...

102
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,255
to walk out
when the leader speaks?

103
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,694
You'd prefer
the leader's son...

104
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:36,054
to piss his pants on live TV?
Hmm?

105
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,896
And still the people
freeze to death!

106
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,059
I love this country.

107
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,314
I don't speak Russian.

108
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,914
In that case, stand up...

109
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:15,793
put your hands
behind your head...

110
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,513
and turn around slowly.

111
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:26,317
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

112
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:34,996
Listen,
if I give this to you...

113
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,477
you'll give it to your daddy.

114
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:41,000
What's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

115
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,478
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me $1 million.

116
00:13:44,518 --> 00:13:46,438
If we go in partners,
we'll split 50-50.

117
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:48,837
Half a million hard currency.

118
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,440
Think of the drugs you could buy
with that much cake.

119
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,759
You'll be discoing
for a decade in Moscow, mate.

120
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,998
I don't need your small change.

121
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,560
That's your first problem.

122
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,000
Here is your second.

123
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,242
Microchip... please.

124
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:07,721
Freeze!

125
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,802
Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

126
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,163
Suck me... sideways.

127
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:47,006
Aah! Uhh!

128
00:14:47,046 --> 00:14:49,846
Uh! My eyes! Ohh!

129
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,970
Give it up!

130
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:18,050
You got no place to go!

131
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,213
A goddamn button!

132
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:44,253
Back of the building!
Come on!

133
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:57,733
Where's the body?

134
00:15:57,773 --> 00:16:00,014
No body.
Just some guy in rags.

135
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,743
As the bitter chill of winter...

136
00:17:04,783 --> 00:17:06,462
descends on Moscow...

137
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,785
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric...

138
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:11,264
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

139
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,824
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

140
00:17:13,864 --> 00:17:15,785
and leader
of his own political party...

141
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,665
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

142
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,827
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

143
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,586
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

144
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:38,347
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

145
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,786
What beautiful work.

146
00:17:47,908 --> 00:17:50,008
Ah. Cloisonne.

147
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,109
It is old.

148
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,231
Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

149
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,190
Please.

150
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,711
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

151
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:12,553
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

152
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:14,477
until things change.

153
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:18,191
You are married
not even a year...

154
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,554
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

155
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:22,797
I am sorry.

156
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,273
It's not my business.

157
00:18:26,995 --> 00:18:29,914
How come you know
so much about me?

158
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:32,154
It is a gift.

159
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:38,075
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

160
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,956
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

161
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:42,994
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

162
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,556
by the laying of hands.

163
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,485
Hmm.
He's the same build...

164
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,838
as the description
the Russians gave us...

165
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,438
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

166
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:03,598
No.

167
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:08,797
Could be faking it.

168
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:17,241
X- rays are clear.

169
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,759
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

170
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,482
You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

171
00:19:22,522 --> 00:19:23,882
On the airplane, I had chicken.

172
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:26,001
Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

173
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,040
Last year. Same eyes.

174
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,762
Different chin.

175
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,048
Halcyon Hotel, guv.

176
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,292
Stand up!

177
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,490
What is your name?!

178
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,969
Answer the question!

179
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,449
What is your name?! Hey!

180
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,050
Lou, the microchip arrived.

181
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,210
I put the dough in your account.

182
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,448
Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

183
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,049
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

184
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,612
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

185
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:48,891
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

186
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,133
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

187
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:53,332
- I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
- I heard that before.

188
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:55,732
Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

189
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:57,171
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

190
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,573
- Fuck you, Lou.
- See yourself.

191
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,216
Can't seem to break 50.

192
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,460
"One million U.S. dollars...

193
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,979
"nonrefundable...

194
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:00,784
"reserves you a quiet table...

195
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:06,021
"at a romantic little spot
in Berlin called Templehopf...

196
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,904
"which has
a cozy transit lounge.

197
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:11,382
"To get inside, you walk
through the metal detectors...

198
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,662
"and I walk through
the metal detectors.

199
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:17,621
"Since you know I'm not armed,
and I know you're not armed...

200
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:20,462
"we can both fall in love,
and nobody gets hurt. "

201
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:34,906
I can't see him.

202
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:37,344
Then look for him.

203
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:40,386
You have
a long and beautiful cane...

204
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,626
along with your beautiful eyes.

205
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:47,665
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

206
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,109
Who are you?

207
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,825
My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

208
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:54,028
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

209
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:56,107
Had the wine, women, songs...

210
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:59,749
then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

211
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,707
went to live in the forest...
in the nude.

212
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,147
Please leave.

213
00:23:05,748 --> 00:23:08,508
I represent
the professional you hired.

214
00:23:08,548 --> 00:23:10,428
I'm his business manager.

215
00:23:10,468 --> 00:23:12,311
I speak for him.

216
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:14,391
We don't deal
with underlings.

217
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:16,150
Come on, Father. Let's go.

218
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:20,469
Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

219
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:21,950
Ah. Youth.

220
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,311
Who runs this thief?

221
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,352
CIA? Ml-6? Libya?

222
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:33,152
He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

223
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:34,471
He's an independent contractor.

224
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:38,114
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

225
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,833
Oh, yes.

226
00:23:39,873 --> 00:23:44,355
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that...

227
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,914
even with metal detectors...

228
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:48,234
even in this transit lounge.

229
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,792
Oh, it's so early.

230
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,753
You guys wanna get coffee
or something?

231
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,436
Sure.

232
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:03,202
Be quiet.

233
00:24:03,237 --> 00:24:05,516
What is it
you request of my employer?

234
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:07,915
Do you know
what cold fusion is?

235
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,356
Of course.

236
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,516
It's the theory...

237
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,076
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

238
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:15,199
free energy forever.

239
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,480
Yes.

240
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,599
Kaffee?

241
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:18,718
Klein, Bitte.

242
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:23,318
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

243
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:26,117
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

244
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:28,238
have never been able
to duplicate it.

245
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:29,519
Until now.

246
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,201
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

247
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,519
We believe
that this good lady...

248
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,362
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

249
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:44,320
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

250
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,003
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

251
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:49,767
Your offer must inspire him.

252
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:52,322
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

253
00:24:52,362 --> 00:24:56,040
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

254
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,081
She's cagey, difficult.

255
00:24:59,443 --> 00:25:01,644
Maybe your agents are stupid.

256
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:09,483
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

257
00:25:09,523 --> 00:25:11,691
Ridiculous.

258
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:16,325
Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

259
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,727
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

260
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,008
His deposit should go-

261
00:25:20,048 --> 00:25:23,086
Hey. It is not for me.

262
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,566
It is for mother Russia.

263
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,330
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

264
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:32,006
Three million in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

265
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,727
Yes.

266
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:40,848
How long to get
your employer's agreement?

267
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,048
I'll ask.

268
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,409
Your offer has inspired her.

269
00:25:58,449 --> 00:25:59,528
I'll do it.

270
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:03,331
Bank account number in Zurich.

271
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:06,091
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

272
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,850
Bye-bye.

273
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:13,411
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

274
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,452
Too bad we have to kill him.

275
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:19,851
Yeah, too bad.

276
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,095
When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

277
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:39,534
announced in 1989...

278
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:42,657
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

279
00:26:42,697 --> 00:26:46,815
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

280
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,217
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

281
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:52,976
and then condemned
as charlatans.

282
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:57,018
The protocols of cold fusion...

283
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,418
What are those? Drugs?

284
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,458
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

285
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,536
She's boring the life
out of me.

286
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:07,299
- They're for my heart.
- Oh.

287
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,578
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

288
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:13,946
- Who are you?
- Me?

289
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,419
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

290
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:19,062
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

291
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:21,940
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

292
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,021
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

293
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,144
Dr. Emma Russell.

294
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:35,181
Oops.

295
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:44,944
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

296
00:27:44,984 --> 00:27:46,864
I'm actually more interested...

297
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:50,263
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

298
00:27:50,303 --> 00:27:52,346
so I thought we would
start with those.

299
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,385
Any questions?

300
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:57,667
Please?

301
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,147
I have, Dr. Russell.

302
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:03,226
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

303
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,827
you know, the theory?

304
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,584
Yes. Oh, there it is.

305
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:11,469
This is the-the apparatus.

306
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:12,828
And very simply...

307
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,989
when positively charged
deuterons...

308
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,868
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

309
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,307
they cram together...

310
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:23,748
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

311
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:27,029
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

312
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,151
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

313
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,712
But I read somewhere...

314
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,431
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

315
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:36,110
so how do we know it works?

316
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,230
We don't.

317
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,389
Not yet.

318
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,270
But if you remember Einstein...

319
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,310
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

320
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,511
long before he could prove it.

321
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:47,635
I mean, he felt the truth.

322
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,311
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

323
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,511
about cold fusion...

324
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:55,914
because it's there.
It's in nature...

325
00:28:55,954 --> 00:29:00,515
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

326
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:04,794
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

327
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,034
I mean, just imagine.

328
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:11,992
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

329
00:29:12,032 --> 00:29:14,757
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

330
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:18,714
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

331
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,117
on a gallon of heavy water.

332
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:23,915
It would be the end
of pollution...

333
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:26,398
warmth for the whole world.

334
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:31,597
So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

335
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:35,239
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

336
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,478
They used very complex...

337
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,477
November 17, 11:30 a. m.

338
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:45,040
Entering flat
of Dr. Emma Russell.

339
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,278
High Street, Oxford.

340
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,199
No alarms on outer doors.
Strange.

341
00:29:50,239 --> 00:29:51,801
No messages.

342
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,242
Shelley Monument.

343
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,320
Entering bathroom.

344
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,483
Books.

345
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,042
More books.

346
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:14,360
Walls covered
with reminder notes.

347
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:17,483
Poetry.

348
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:32,524
Ah. Dad.

349
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:06,290
"Stop and talk to Shelley
every day.

350
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,811
"How can I love
a man named Percy?"

351
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,450
"Isn't there
someone in the world...

352
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,449
"who can consume me like that. "

353
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:19,609
Magic. Romantic.

354
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,493
No recent applications.

355
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:30,492
"Cold fusion notes. "

356
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,574
"Although I pass the
Shelley Monument every day...

357
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,854
"its sadness strikes me
every time. "

358
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:50,213
"I feel a very personal loss
when I look at it.

359
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,216
"So much pain
and so much passion. "

360
00:31:57,454 --> 00:31:59,936
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness...

361
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:01,416
"and in the shadow of death. "

362
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,817
"Luke 1; verse 79."

363
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,737
Tretiak's wrong.
She's not cagey.

364
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:12,698
She's not difficult.
She's just...

365
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:13,979
eccentric.

366
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,618
She's innocent.

367
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:24,060
Maybe it's in her head.

368
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:29,218
She needs a poet...
an artist...

369
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,580
someone who...

370
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,300
understands truth.

371
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,303
She needs Thomas More.

372
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:30,628
Do you like it?

373
00:33:32,786 --> 00:33:33,789
What?

374
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:36,908
The sculpture. Do you like it?

375
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,708
Oh... yes.

376
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,588
What do you love about it?

377
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,029
The way it... glows.

378
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:01,831
And how the light...

379
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:04,391
holds him in silence...

380
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,433
taking care of him.

381
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,551
That's what I like about it.

382
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:16,432
Are you an artist?

383
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:21,794
No. I'm just a traveler
searching for purity.

384
00:34:22,714 --> 00:34:25,394
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

385
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:27,273
Yes.

386
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:32,677
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

387
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,436
No, not really.

388
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,716
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home...

389
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:41,875
in Africa.

390
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,398
You should
experience the energy...

391
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:46,157
of where all life began.

392
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,757
Sorry.
I'm not very good with people.

393
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:00,437
Me, neither.

394
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:30,521
"I see my angel
for the first time...

395
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,561
"know my purpose,
feel my birth... "

396
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:38,243
"hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly...

397
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,642
"the sweet strains
of our union... "

398
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:45,243
"Our love heats up
the cold universe...

399
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:48,006
"and gives my tired,
desperate hope... "

400
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:50,804
"purified
by our kisses...

401
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,524
"are eternally healed. "

402
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:56,373
Do you like it?

403
00:35:56,408 --> 00:35:58,646
Who did you write it for?

404
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:01,086
You.

405
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:04,525
You're following me,
or it's destiny.

406
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,006
Either way, it's weird.

407
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:08,527
Very weird.

408
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,486
Destiny then.

409
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,690
This must look strange.

410
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,571
It's, uh...

411
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:30,570
something that I'm working on...

412
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,250
a formula for...

413
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,368
creating energy.

414
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,009
That you carry around
in your underwear?

415
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:42,851
Yeah, I do.

416
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:57,052
How did you do that?

417
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:01,055
Magic.

418
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,774
Give it back.

419
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:04,294
It looks like Sanskrit.

420
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,214
Give it back.

421
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:11,414
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

422
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:15,694
What else do you keep in there?

423
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:17,576
Nothing.

424
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:18,976
That's not true.

425
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:23,298
Can I get you
anything else?

426
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:29,779
Drink your wine.
Latour '57.

427
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:34,778
The Latour, sir,
is $400 a bottle.

428
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,977
Then we'll have two bottles.

429
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,859
There. You count it.

430
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,222
All these little tubes
and microbes and things.

431
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:56,581
Molecules?

432
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,660
Those, too.

433
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,263
Can I tell you something?

434
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:03,264
What? You must. Everything.

435
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:05,742
It's a secret.

436
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:06,902
What?

437
00:38:08,783 --> 00:38:10,262
I'm done.

438
00:38:12,821 --> 00:38:15,943
My energy research-
I'm finished.

439
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:19,262
I still have some sequencing
that I have to work out...

440
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:22,384
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

441
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:27,026
It's just been you against
the whole world, hasn't it?

442
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,625
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

443
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:31,306
The gift of faith.

444
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:35,267
To see...

445
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:37,946
Well...

446
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:41,465
to believe in something
that's all around us...

447
00:38:42,464 --> 00:38:45,468
but hidden from our sight.

448
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:47,948
That's a beautiful thought.

449
00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:49,987
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

450
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:54,068
I don't even know your name.

451
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:55,588
Well, my name is...

452
00:38:57,228 --> 00:38:58,670
I don't want to tell you.

453
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,748
I don't want to do that.

454
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:05,191
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

455
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,590
What's your name?

456
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,030
- Emma.
- Emma.

457
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,709
Now I know
everything about you.

458
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:18,510
Your... genius.

459
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,191
You have a weak heart.

460
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:29,631
You have beautiful dreams,
great courage.

461
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:33,193
You're not afraid in this world.

462
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,114
You get that from your father.

463
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:39,794
You can't cook
to save your life...

464
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:42,234
and you love fish.

465
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,192
I do love fish.

466
00:39:47,232 --> 00:39:49,395
That's weird.

467
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,996
I want to try that.

468
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:52,555
- No.
- Yes.

469
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,514
I don't want you to.
Drink your wine.

470
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,076
Yes, I do.

471
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,636
What's your name?

472
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:04,556
My name is Thomas More.

473
00:40:04,596 --> 00:40:08,079
I was named after the saint...

474
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,798
who died for his faith.

475
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:15,718
OK.

476
00:40:18,157 --> 00:40:19,317
Your work...

477
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,799
is very dangerous...
and alive...

478
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:27,121
and I love your poems.

479
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,241
They move me.

480
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,759
But that's not
who you really are.

481
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,081
You're running away from...

482
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:39,723
your past and your pain...

483
00:40:40,323 --> 00:40:43,882
and yet you keep it
so close to you.

484
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:50,080
So you don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

485
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,003
because you're beautiful.

486
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,730
What are you doing?

487
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:13,533
Oh, my God,
you're bleeding. What happened?

488
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,735
Don't know. I was...

489
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:18,855
weeping, and I slipped.

490
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:21,214
I was thinking of you.
I don't know.

491
00:42:21,254 --> 00:42:23,414
I live right down the street.

492
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:25,133
I could clean you up.

493
00:42:26,414 --> 00:42:28,294
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

494
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,576
- I don't know.
- Wait.

495
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,456
I'm glad it stopped bleeding.

496
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,775
Don't need stitches.

497
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:48,179
We're gonna have
to disinfect it, though.

498
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:50,698
You really are an angel.

499
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:51,898
You are.

500
00:42:55,058 --> 00:42:56,936
It's gonna hurt.

501
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,256
- Aah!
- Aah!

502
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:00,259
Oh, sorry.

503
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,218
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

504
00:43:05,258 --> 00:43:07,100
Yeah.

505
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,980
I'm sorry. I was just joking.

506
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:11,979
I...

507
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:14,061
- I should go.
- Oh, no.

508
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:16,460
Yes. You-you... I...

509
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,463
Take off your pants.

510
00:43:19,503 --> 00:43:20,624
Pardon?

511
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,183
I mean, your sweater.

512
00:43:25,622 --> 00:43:28,501
There's blood on it.
I'll wash it.

513
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:34,623
Very domestic.

514
00:43:35,942 --> 00:43:39,705
There's blood
on your blouse as well.

515
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:43,503
I'll wash it.

516
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:58,826
Do you have any wine?

517
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:15,667
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

518
00:44:15,707 --> 00:44:17,149
How could I not?

519
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:21,349
You make me feel so good.

520
00:44:21,389 --> 00:44:22,511
I wish you...

521
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:26,031
I wish you could understand.

522
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,590
I want you to know who I am.

523
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:48,154
Oh, my heart.

524
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:51,553
Don't disappear.
I'll be right back.

525
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:54,315
Calm it down.

526
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,875
Bring it round.

527
00:44:56,915 --> 00:45:00,754
Too way high up, your street.

528
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:05,353
I can see...

529
00:45:05,392 --> 00:45:07,875
like nothin' else...

530
00:45:07,915 --> 00:45:11,315
in me, you're better
than I wanna be.

531
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:18,076
Don't think,
'cause I understand...

532
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:19,838
I care...

533
00:45:19,878 --> 00:45:22,276
Don't think,
'cause I'm talking...

534
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:24,917
Oh, I can't do this.

535
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:26,159
She's so great.

536
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,560
I can't believe this.

537
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,038
I can't believe
this is happening.

538
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:33,643
I'm open...

539
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:36,557
to falling from grace.

540
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,882
Hi.

541
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:15,043
"To spider:

542
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:17,724
"Must fly. Have better offer. "

543
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:20,883
Greedy westerner.
Wants more money.

544
00:46:20,923 --> 00:46:22,124
Who cares?

545
00:46:22,164 --> 00:46:25,045
Can't spend hard currency
in hell.

546
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,765
Send this message-

547
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:32,008
"Fly, don't buzz off.

548
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,446
"I'll double your fee...

549
00:46:36,766 --> 00:46:41,005
"or send my own boys
to take care of the woman. "

550
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:50,289
You OK?

551
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:56,810
Let's...
let's just lie here.

552
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:01,491
Can't we just
be like this tonight?

553
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:05,370
Is that what you want?

554
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,810
It's so magic.

555
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,371
It just feels so perfect.

556
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:47,616
It's 7:00 a. m.,
and here are the news headlines.

557
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:57,735
Thomas?

558
00:49:11,307 --> 00:49:13,826
Lev Naumovitch,
it's here! Good man!

559
00:49:13,866 --> 00:49:15,271
It's revolutionary, sir!

560
00:49:15,306 --> 00:49:18,264
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas...

561
00:49:18,304 --> 00:49:20,745
but I think the formula
is incomplete.

562
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:21,867
It will take months...

563
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:23,108
That won't do...

564
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:26,027
because now that the people are
nicely beginning to freeze...

565
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:29,629
Tretiak must sweep in
with a miracle to save them.

566
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:31,907
How high do you want it,
Mr. Tretiak?

567
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:34,310
To the top.
Good morning, Yuri.

568
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,589
Good morning.

569
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:38,549
Perhaps I
can confirm the validity...

570
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:41,192
of this formula more quickly
if I dispense...

571
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:44,071
with certain protocols.
But, Mr. Tretiak-

572
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,190
How long, Dr. Botvin,
since you received...

573
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:49,909
your last salary check
from Moscow University?

574
00:49:49,949 --> 00:49:52,789
Ukrainian Independence Day.

575
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,511
Last August.

576
00:49:57,991 --> 00:50:00,192
Ivan, he's on-line.

577
00:50:02,192 --> 00:50:03,271
Do it.

578
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:07,674
To spider...

579
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:11,513
You've got the recipe.

580
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:12,755
"Where's my dough?"

581
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:14,795
To human fly...

582
00:50:16,034 --> 00:50:19,234
Recipe incomplete.

583
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:21,193
The cake won't rise.

584
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:24,113
Hence, no dough.

585
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:32,516
I am not the baker...

586
00:50:32,557 --> 00:50:35,075
"... but don't make me
the butcher. "

587
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:38,997
I like this guy.

588
00:50:42,997 --> 00:50:45,920
No play, no pay.

589
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,438
I'm certain you kept
the cookbook.

590
00:50:57,718 --> 00:50:58,799
Holland Park.

591
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,440
I'll check that for you.

592
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:18,482
Yes, that seems to be fine.
One moment. Aah!

593
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,043
He's keeping me on-line.

594
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:39,724
You wait here.

595
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,930
You, beside the car.

596
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,689
Now, turn around.
Step away from the vehicle.

597
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,848
He's armed!

598
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,496
Drive!

599
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:05,094
Go the other way. Go!

600
00:53:09,814 --> 00:53:12,017
You're all I've got tonight.

601
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:15,895
You're all I've got tonight.

602
00:53:18,058 --> 00:53:19,337
What about him?

603
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:29,178
What about this one?

604
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:35,979
Yeah. That-

605
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:39,179
We believe
they're all the same villain.

606
00:53:43,781 --> 00:53:45,180
Oh, my God.

607
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,261
They're all him?

608
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:50,940
We believe so.

609
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,821
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

610
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,423
Then he fled the U.K.
out of Heathrow.

611
00:53:58,463 --> 00:54:00,182
We've got a handful
of false identities...

612
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:03,582
used on visas,
passports, leases...

613
00:54:04,781 --> 00:54:06,461
Nicholas Owen...

614
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:08,142
Louie Guanella...

615
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:09,343
Peter Damian...

616
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:12,902
Charles Borroneo.

617
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:15,385
Of course.

618
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:18,103
Thomas More.

619
00:54:18,143 --> 00:54:20,146
All names of Catholic saints.

620
00:54:23,505 --> 00:54:25,904
Can you access
Heathrow's passenger lists...

621
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:28,907
for the last eight hours?

622
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:31,106
I think it might be possible.

623
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:32,266
Good.

624
00:54:40,107 --> 00:54:41,228
Go!

625
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:00,112
Yeah!

626
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,512
Yes!

627
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:25,274
See, my friends...

628
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:28,954
you back the biggest rats.

629
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:50,396
Hello.

630
00:55:54,276 --> 00:55:55,758
Out, out.

631
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:58,161
Freeloaders, out.

632
00:55:58,196 --> 00:55:59,795
I want to drink alone.

633
00:55:59,835 --> 00:56:01,077
Close the curtain.

634
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:24,400
- What?
- What?

635
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,762
Don't look down.

636
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,641
You know who I am?

637
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:32,921
No.

638
00:56:32,961 --> 00:56:36,562
I'm the thief
you tried to cheat.

639
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,442
This is your accountant.

640
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:43,120
Talk to him.

641
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:48,204
The phone goes
the other way, you moron.

642
00:56:51,722 --> 00:56:53,284
Hello.

643
00:56:53,324 --> 00:56:54,924
Tretiak speaking.

644
00:56:55,764 --> 00:57:00,164
That money to Zurich,
send it now.

645
00:57:00,204 --> 00:57:01,684
I said now.

646
00:57:03,123 --> 00:57:04,365
Yeah.

647
00:57:06,888 --> 00:57:08,008
Thank you.

648
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:12,726
You know what the hardest part
about being you is?

649
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,285
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

650
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,366
You son of the bitch.

651
00:57:20,087 --> 00:57:22,446
There is an impostor.
Get him out.

652
00:57:22,486 --> 00:57:24,968
Hey, hey, hey!

653
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,567
Take your hands off me,
you idiots!

654
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:30,890
Are you crazy? It's me.

655
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,049
Go, go!

656
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:33,374
Catch him, go!

657
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,288
Ilya, get the bastard!

658
00:57:57,212 --> 00:57:59,492
Fifty million. I'm out.

659
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:03,892
Mr. Ferrer checking out.

660
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,452
OK.

661
00:58:15,934 --> 00:58:18,334
I'll have one, too.

662
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,014
Emma.

663
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:21,894
Hi.

664
00:58:22,854 --> 00:58:25,454
I'm... I'm overwhelmed.

665
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:28,297
You found me.

666
00:58:28,337 --> 00:58:29,937
Wasn't very hard.

667
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:34,778
Two men with saint's names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

668
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:38,736
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African...

669
00:58:38,776 --> 00:58:41,179
whereas Vincent Ferrer-

670
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:43,259
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

671
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:45,177
How could you do it?

672
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,538
Emma...

673
00:58:47,578 --> 00:58:50,177
I- I had to.

674
00:58:51,496 --> 00:58:52,697
I'm a thief.

675
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,659
I want my cards back.

676
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,620
You flew all this way
for your cards?

677
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,739
Yes, I did.

678
00:58:57,779 --> 00:59:00,340
No.
It's because you're in love.

679
00:59:03,979 --> 00:59:05,220
I rest my case.

680
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,021
Who are you?

681
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:10,100
No one has a clue,
least of all me.

682
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,783
And why would you
steal cold fusion?

683
00:59:13,823 --> 00:59:17,021
It's free.
Why would you do that?

684
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,742
Eight million reasons.

685
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:23,381
Eight million.
Wow. That's all?

686
00:59:25,064 --> 00:59:28,423
I would have
given them to you...

687
00:59:28,463 --> 00:59:30,263
if you'd only asked.

688
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:37,746
You've got
to get away from me.

689
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:41,105
I'm not going until you tell me
why you lied to me.

690
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:43,625
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

691
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:46,107
You almost got me killed.
The guy says it doesn't work.

692
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:47,866
Well, screw him.

693
00:59:47,906 --> 00:59:50,106
I don't think you'd enjoy that.

694
00:59:50,146 --> 00:59:52,027
You're right.
I don't think I would.

695
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,386
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

696
01:00:03,988 --> 01:00:05,389
What?

697
01:00:13,788 --> 01:00:15,429
- They took my pills.
- No, they didn't.

698
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:17,472
I palmed them from your purse.

699
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,631
I need one or two.

700
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:22,710
I need...
I have a bad heart.

701
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,830
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

702
01:00:24,865 --> 01:00:26,446
It's OK. I've got your pills.

703
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:29,216
OK, I've got two in my hand.

704
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,951
I'm gonna pass out.

705
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:33,791
Sit down on the floor.

706
01:00:35,353 --> 01:00:38,432
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

707
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,232
That's right.
Eat two out of my hand.

708
01:00:40,272 --> 01:00:43,674
That's right. OK?

709
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:46,074
While you're down there...

710
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:50,595
Get the pocketknife
out of my boot.

711
01:00:53,154 --> 01:00:56,833
This formula makes
certain assumptions...

712
01:00:56,873 --> 01:01:01,075
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes...

713
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,276
so testing at any level
becomes futile...

714
01:01:03,316 --> 01:01:06,877
without further information,
Mr. Tretiak.

715
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,596
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.

716
01:01:09,636 --> 01:01:11,035
Help is here.

717
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,918
The two came very quietly.

718
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:27,358
Oh.

719
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,079
And they left even more quietly.

720
01:01:36,758 --> 01:01:38,118
Close the city.

721
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:43,159
Kill him, and bring her... alive.

722
01:01:56,802 --> 01:01:59,562
Why are they after me?

723
01:01:59,602 --> 01:02:03,721
Tretiak, the guy I work for...
he owns this city, cops and all.

724
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:07,883
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

725
01:02:07,918 --> 01:02:09,922
What do you want from me?

726
01:02:15,804 --> 01:02:19,205
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

727
01:02:19,245 --> 01:02:20,684
So the formula works?

728
01:02:20,724 --> 01:02:23,207
Oh, kiss me again.

729
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,892
- No.
- Make up your mind.

730
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:31,966
Oh, it's-I have to
figure out the order...

731
01:02:32,006 --> 01:02:34,685
before the formula works,
and I'm not giving it to him.

732
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:36,726
- Tretiak will find you.
- No.

733
01:02:36,766 --> 01:02:39,167
He found me,
and that's hard to do.

734
01:02:39,207 --> 01:02:43,168
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

735
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,488
What do you need?

736
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,770
I need some time...

737
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,049
and I need...

738
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:57,131
I need a place to work...

739
01:02:57,171 --> 01:02:58,730
and...

740
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,890
Where's everyone going?

741
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:05,168
To their country
relatives to cut firewood.

742
01:03:05,208 --> 01:03:06,849
There's no heat in the city.

743
01:03:16,652 --> 01:03:18,692
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

744
01:03:18,732 --> 01:03:20,294
I don't know.

745
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:23,412
Two hours, maybe.
I don't know.

746
01:03:23,452 --> 01:03:26,013
Should be enough time to get
our passports together...

747
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,896
and for us to get married.

748
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:31,534
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

749
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:35,814
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

750
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,895
- You're not Martin.
- No.

751
01:03:43,334 --> 01:03:44,495
Who are you?

752
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,256
I don't have a name.

753
01:03:50,816 --> 01:03:52,018
That's sad.

754
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:54,338
Will you have a name
when we get home?

755
01:03:54,378 --> 01:03:56,217
I don't have a home.

756
01:03:56,257 --> 01:03:57,937
When we get back...

757
01:03:57,977 --> 01:04:00,179
you do the science,
I'll do the math.

758
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,898
We'll market your formula
around the world.

759
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:05,058
We'll make a fortune,
and then...

760
01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:07,857
we'll see.

761
01:04:09,216 --> 01:04:10,857
OK?

762
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:20,380
Emma!

763
01:04:37,662 --> 01:04:39,222
No trouble, OK?

764
01:04:42,621 --> 01:04:45,823
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

765
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:33,149
Ohh!

766
01:06:41,718 --> 01:06:43,038
Spice room, sun room...

767
01:06:43,078 --> 01:06:45,118
Shadow room, night...

768
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:48,237
I've got you.

769
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:55,998
Come on.

770
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,000
Here we go. Up.

771
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,922
We've gotta get you warm.

772
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:17,362
We're almost there.

773
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:41,647
Come on.

774
01:07:42,968 --> 01:07:44,847
Come on.

775
01:07:50,006 --> 01:07:53,045
You'll wait till Christ
comes to Moscow.

776
01:07:53,085 --> 01:07:55,687
Elevator was made of mahogany.

777
01:07:55,727 --> 01:07:57,806
Tenants used it
for firewood last winter.

778
01:07:57,846 --> 01:07:59,366
We need your help.

779
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:02,089
He fell in the river,
and he's freezing.

780
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:03,768
- Need clothes.
- We're just people-

781
01:08:03,808 --> 01:08:08,090
You're not people.
You're Americans.

782
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,250
Yes, but we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

783
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:46,496
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys her.

784
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,534
No heat for sale...

785
01:08:50,574 --> 01:08:52,415
but these clothes
will make him warm.

786
01:08:57,654 --> 01:09:00,175
I tell her, Mashenka,
go back to bed.

787
01:09:00,215 --> 01:09:02,215
She's always puttering around.

788
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:09,695
It's here.
Built to escape Secret Police.

789
01:09:09,735 --> 01:09:11,177
In you go.

790
01:09:25,257 --> 01:09:27,577
You've got hypothermia.

791
01:09:27,616 --> 01:09:30,019
We have to get
these wet clothes off...

792
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:32,460
keep you warm.

793
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,461
They must be in
one of these buildings.

794
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:37,101
Check every apartment.

795
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:42,022
How you doing? Talk to me.

796
01:09:42,062 --> 01:09:44,780
Snug as a bug in a rug.

797
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:55,822
OK. We're gonna...

798
01:09:55,862 --> 01:09:59,741
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature...

799
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,624
falls below 95 degrees.

800
01:10:14,905 --> 01:10:17,745
Two kids
talking about foreigners.

801
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,946
Listen to me, tenants!

802
01:10:28,785 --> 01:10:30,945
Show me where
the Americans are...

803
01:10:30,985 --> 01:10:34,828
and you'll be paid
in American dollars.

804
01:10:34,868 --> 01:10:37,147
Five hundred bucks reward.

805
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:38,346
Daddy...

806
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,947
have you seen, by chance,
two Americans?

807
01:10:42,987 --> 01:10:45,670
Just one American
and one polar bear.

808
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,308
Do we get 250?

809
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:09,391
We check upstairs.

810
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:22,754
What's your name?

811
01:11:26,035 --> 01:11:27,434
Who are you really?

812
01:11:29,394 --> 01:11:30,514
Simon.

813
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:31,754
Simon?

814
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:35,633
So you are named for a saint.

815
01:11:35,673 --> 01:11:37,435
No, Simon the magician.

816
01:11:38,316 --> 01:11:40,355
I did tricks...

817
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:43,836
tricks for Agnes...
and that's how I got things.

818
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:47,716
Priests took everything,
took Agnes.

819
01:11:47,756 --> 01:11:49,758
Dogs too big.

820
01:11:49,798 --> 01:11:52,756
Teeth. Teeth.

821
01:11:52,796 --> 01:11:54,517
She fell.

822
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:55,879
I escaped.

823
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,399
I always escape.

824
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:02,118
I don't believe in magic
anymore.

825
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:04,997
I do.

826
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:10,159
I've never felt
like this before.

827
01:12:11,319 --> 01:12:12,438
How?

828
01:12:13,798 --> 01:12:15,280
I'm freezing.

829
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:21,402
These are here!

830
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,042
We gotta get out of here.
Are you OK?

831
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:33,162
They're coming.

832
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:36,720
Americans are here!

833
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,081
Hurry. Here, put this on.

834
01:12:44,683 --> 01:12:45,802
Ilya!

835
01:12:58,887 --> 01:13:00,127
Upstairs. Go!

836
01:13:17,446 --> 01:13:18,968
Maybe we can jump.

837
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:21,528
Let's jump.

838
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:27,249
Come on.

839
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:53,052
Wait.

840
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:11,134
We need her alive, idiot.

841
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:15,256
Embassy's east of here.

842
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:35,618
You're late.
Where have you been?

843
01:14:36,379 --> 01:14:38,018
I've been waiting two hours.

844
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:41,578
I've got some beautiful
paintings for you to buy.

845
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:43,097
In here. Come on.

846
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:51,059
Don't fret.
It's just my curator, Toli.

847
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:53,701
I am Alexa Frankievitch,
but being you're Americans...

848
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:55,540
you can call me Frankie.

849
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,579
OK, Frankie.
I've got money. We want-

850
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:01,461
I know. The icon
of the Virgin of the Damned.

851
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:03,860
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

852
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,583
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American Embassy.

853
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:09,583
Right.
I need $10,000 up-front.

854
01:15:09,623 --> 01:15:11,867
No.

855
01:15:11,902 --> 01:15:15,302
OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.

856
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:16,741
Shh.

857
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:25,465
Police.

858
01:15:25,505 --> 01:15:27,464
No. Tretiak's goons.

859
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:37,384
Wait.

860
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:40,307
Sasha,
go east to the embassy.

861
01:15:40,347 --> 01:15:42,266
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

862
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:45,506
You're in Russia, sir.
Everything is complicated.

863
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,585
But you know the way?

864
01:15:46,705 --> 01:15:50,145
Like the face
of a Bulgari chronograph.

865
01:16:00,028 --> 01:16:01,868
I remember. This way.

866
01:16:06,068 --> 01:16:08,709
At last. Water main.

867
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:11,672
They shut it down
each afternoon in winter.

868
01:16:11,712 --> 01:16:13,271
What time do they
turn it back on?

869
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:16,590
You have five minutes,
plus or minus.

870
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:17,710
Plus or minus?

871
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,074
That means several
minutes earlier or later.

872
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:23,150
Don't worry.
Third opening is your embassy.

873
01:16:40,594 --> 01:16:42,435
Quick. Someone's coming.

874
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:50,473
Come on. Come on.

875
01:16:57,955 --> 01:16:59,914
Here's the second one.

876
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:01,676
Embassy's next.

877
01:17:05,236 --> 01:17:08,757
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah. Unless it's minus.

878
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:15,040
Damn.
It's sealed.

879
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,238
We'll have to go back.

880
01:17:18,278 --> 01:17:19,438
Come on.

881
01:17:42,441 --> 01:17:43,642
Hurry.

882
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:55,280
Up you go.

883
01:18:14,044 --> 01:18:16,967
Yankee, go home!
Down with Yankee!

884
01:18:24,486 --> 01:18:27,645
Embassy's only
about 100 yards away.

885
01:18:27,685 --> 01:18:31,128
There's a car right above us.
Watch your head.

886
01:19:03,132 --> 01:19:05,051
I'll create a diversion.

887
01:19:05,091 --> 01:19:07,773
It should take you 10 seconds
to run to those gates.

888
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:09,693
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

889
01:19:10,572 --> 01:19:12,252
OK. I can do that.

890
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:14,334
You can do it.

891
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:18,211
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

892
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:20,172
I'll find you. You found me.

893
01:19:20,215 --> 01:19:21,816
Yeah, I did.

894
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:52,019
Aah!

895
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:25,464
I'm an American!
Open the gate!

896
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,942
Open the gate!
I'm an American!

897
01:20:28,622 --> 01:20:30,742
Back off from the gate.

898
01:20:30,782 --> 01:20:33,621
Back off. I said back off.

899
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:37,982
Stand back from the gate.

900
01:20:39,623 --> 01:20:41,062
I said back off!

901
01:20:53,544 --> 01:20:54,986
She outran you?

902
01:20:55,026 --> 01:20:56,986
How humiliating.

903
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:03,826
One... shot left.

904
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:07,385
Can't come
all the way to Russia...

905
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:10,109
and not play Russian roulette.

906
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:12,307
Before you shoot me,
want to know where the money is?

907
01:21:13,946 --> 01:21:15,548
Whose money?

908
01:21:15,588 --> 01:21:17,148
Tretiak's, yours.

909
01:21:17,188 --> 01:21:19,548
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

910
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:21,070
What are you saying?

911
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,229
I'm saying your father
stashed billions...

912
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:26,149
and I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

913
01:21:26,189 --> 01:21:29,712
So... where are all those
hidden billions?

914
01:21:30,431 --> 01:21:34,190
I know... but I don't think
I'm gonna tell you.

915
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,554
Joseph, what's the holdup?
I said get 'em inside!

916
01:22:05,594 --> 01:22:07,474
You're worse
than all the others.

917
01:22:07,514 --> 01:22:10,112
However, burns will heal.

918
01:22:10,152 --> 01:22:12,715
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

919
01:22:12,755 --> 01:22:15,995
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

920
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:18,277
Lucky? Look at me.

921
01:22:19,156 --> 01:22:21,716
I am a damn devil.

922
01:22:21,756 --> 01:22:23,236
Christ.

923
01:22:26,397 --> 01:22:27,476
Yes?

924
01:22:27,516 --> 01:22:30,517
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

925
01:22:30,557 --> 01:22:34,919
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

926
01:22:34,959 --> 01:22:37,158
but rather... impossible.

927
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,837
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion.

928
01:22:41,757 --> 01:22:44,478
I invest millions...

929
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:48,479
and you can't make it work!

930
01:22:51,761 --> 01:22:54,559
What are you doing
with my money?

931
01:22:57,122 --> 01:23:00,800
Do you think it comes so easy?

932
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,962
No!

933
01:23:02,002 --> 01:23:03,963
But, sir...

934
01:23:04,003 --> 01:23:08,482
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

935
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:12,920
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite convincing.

936
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,441
It does?

937
01:23:18,724 --> 01:23:22,844
Yes. It does.

938
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:24,844
Good man.

939
01:23:24,884 --> 01:23:27,444
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

940
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:32,523
Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

941
01:23:32,563 --> 01:23:35,247
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

942
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:38,966
From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

943
01:23:39,006 --> 01:23:40,806
all of them loyal to us.

944
01:23:40,846 --> 01:23:42,846
Make certain
they get the message-

945
01:23:42,886 --> 01:23:45,646
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

946
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:49,287
Mr. President.

947
01:23:49,327 --> 01:23:52,327
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

948
01:23:52,367 --> 01:23:57,448
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

949
01:23:57,488 --> 01:24:00,929
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

950
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,288
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

951
01:24:04,328 --> 01:24:07,171
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

952
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:09,850
from a scientific viewpoint.

953
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:13,010
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

954
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:16,168
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

955
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,689
Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

956
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:21,292
let's dispense with the bad.

957
01:24:21,332 --> 01:24:23,451
What is the price
of this marvel?

958
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,212
The cost of research
and development are there...

959
01:24:26,252 --> 01:24:29,811
which is all
you are asked to defray.

960
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:37,333
Ten billion in hard currency?

961
01:24:37,373 --> 01:24:42,294
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

962
01:24:49,493 --> 01:24:51,414
Where are you heading?

963
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:54,734
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

964
01:24:58,777 --> 01:25:01,735
Like the miracle of socialism...

965
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:04,977
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

966
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,138
But no matter.

967
01:25:06,177 --> 01:25:10,299
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

968
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:13,738
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

969
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:16,538
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

970
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:20,056
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

971
01:25:20,096 --> 01:25:23,379
Not now, old witch.
We're working.

972
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:24,820
Yes. Think of it.

973
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:30,460
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

974
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:34,460
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

975
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,501
You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

976
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,100
Any medical problems?

977
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,581
I have a heart condition.

978
01:25:40,621 --> 01:25:43,063
Do you need me to arrange
any medication for you?

979
01:25:43,944 --> 01:25:46,381
Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

980
01:25:46,902 --> 01:25:48,062
That's strange.

981
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:50,142
Get a form from
table three down the corridor.

982
01:25:50,182 --> 01:25:51,621
I'll be back in 10 minutes...

983
01:25:51,661 --> 01:25:53,781
by your side,
all the way to the airport.

984
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:54,942
Thank you.

985
01:25:54,982 --> 01:25:57,143
...Across the street
in central Moscow...

986
01:25:57,183 --> 01:26:01,624
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

987
01:26:01,664 --> 01:26:05,463
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

988
01:26:05,544 --> 01:26:07,306
I'm told
that all American citizens...

989
01:26:07,346 --> 01:26:09,865
have been asked to report
to the American embassy...

990
01:26:09,905 --> 01:26:11,744
for immediate evacuation.

991
01:26:11,784 --> 01:26:14,946
Excuse me. You look lost.

992
01:26:14,986 --> 01:26:17,351
- No, I'm fine.
- May I help you?

993
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:21,946
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is August Christopher.

994
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:25,425
Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase-

995
01:26:25,465 --> 01:26:27,909
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

996
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,467
"but do not give it yet. "

997
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:37,828
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

998
01:26:37,868 --> 01:26:39,030
Are you coming with me?

999
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:42,428
No. But they are.

1000
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:51,830
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1001
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,670
Find a quiet room.

1002
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:56,749
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1003
01:26:56,789 --> 01:26:58,470
My number's on the back.

1004
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:02,150
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1005
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:03,950
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1006
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,993
or you'll never be safe.

1007
01:27:06,033 --> 01:27:07,712
Be good at school.

1008
01:27:07,752 --> 01:27:08,871
Wait.

1009
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:14,153
- Don't you trust me, darlin'?
- Trust who?

1010
01:27:14,992 --> 01:27:16,672
That hurts, Emma.

1011
01:27:16,712 --> 01:27:19,275
I'm serious.
What's your name?

1012
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:21,994
My name is August Christopher.

1013
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:24,914
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1014
01:27:24,955 --> 01:27:26,872
I mean, Vincent Ferrer...

1015
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:29,033
I mean, Martin de Porres...

1016
01:27:30,235 --> 01:27:31,996
Thomas More.

1017
01:27:33,116 --> 01:27:35,954
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1018
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,716
You have to be a very good...

1019
01:27:38,756 --> 01:27:42,155
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1020
01:27:42,195 --> 01:27:45,676
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1021
01:27:45,716 --> 01:27:47,917
Now, get to work.

1022
01:27:48,676 --> 01:27:50,279
Who's that man?

1023
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:52,599
You're leaving
on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?

1024
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:55,518
Probably be your
last chance out of here.

1025
01:27:55,558 --> 01:27:56,998
Better hurry. It's leaving.

1026
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:01,800
Your troops
will depose the president...

1027
01:28:01,839 --> 01:28:04,679
and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.

1028
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:09,280
Moscow must be
ringed with tanks by evening.

1029
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,519
Don't worry.
The people will follow me.

1030
01:28:12,559 --> 01:28:14,722
They will be crying
for revolution.

1031
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:17,241
Still, no one's
guessed the simple truth...

1032
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:19,282
of where the heating oil went.

1033
01:28:23,323 --> 01:28:26,002
Who would believe
that a sea of oil...

1034
01:28:26,042 --> 01:28:28,602
was hidden under
this very building?

1035
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:33,081
Yuri, I understand
your Nataly is to...

1036
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:35,604
Francis, you devil...

1037
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,883
I heard you came here,
and you didn't call me.

1038
01:28:37,923 --> 01:28:41,164
- Hello, Dominic-
- Give me a ring, Charles.

1039
01:28:41,204 --> 01:28:43,803
Lou,
I've heard on the grapevine...

1040
01:28:43,843 --> 01:28:47,045
you're brokering a revolutionary
new energy source.

1041
01:28:47,885 --> 01:28:50,084
If it's as good
as it's cracked up to be...

1042
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:53,247
I have friends who can double
your best offer...

1043
01:28:53,287 --> 01:28:55,367
on deposit in Zurich...

1044
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:58,166
within one hour
of delivery and confirmation.

1045
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,086
I'll be waiting.

1046
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,248
The work could be here.

1047
01:29:22,288 --> 01:29:24,128
This machine could work,
couldn't it?

1048
01:29:26,811 --> 01:29:28,410
Who are you?

1049
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:30,490
A friend of Dr. Russell's.

1050
01:29:30,530 --> 01:29:31,690
Dr. Russell?

1051
01:29:33,769 --> 01:29:35,768
What's this equation?

1052
01:29:35,809 --> 01:29:37,132
It's so simple.

1053
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:40,611
This is the key
to Dr. Russell's formula.

1054
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:41,931
Yes.

1055
01:29:43,693 --> 01:29:45,852
The alarm. You had better go.

1056
01:29:45,892 --> 01:29:49,774
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

1057
01:29:51,253 --> 01:29:53,332
But Mr. Tretiak's rally
is tonight.

1058
01:29:53,372 --> 01:29:54,973
Can you make it work?

1059
01:29:56,575 --> 01:29:57,696
Make it work.

1060
01:30:02,054 --> 01:30:03,454
What is wrong here?

1061
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:04,854
Uh, the alarm...

1062
01:30:07,453 --> 01:30:09,294
Uh... uh...

1063
01:30:10,014 --> 01:30:11,415
I tripped.

1064
01:30:19,896 --> 01:30:23,298
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

1065
01:30:23,338 --> 01:30:24,977
You are Nikolai Provovich-

1066
01:30:25,017 --> 01:30:26,178
Petrovich.

1067
01:30:36,817 --> 01:30:38,776
Tunnel built by KGB...

1068
01:30:40,939 --> 01:30:43,220
Leads to machine room
in Kremlin.

1069
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,301
Do you know where
the president's quarters are?

1070
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:51,139
President Karpov is there.

1071
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:55,181
But there are many guards,
so I suggest-

1072
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:57,140
An alternate route?

1073
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,983
Money. Now.

1074
01:31:01,864 --> 01:31:03,383
Oh, ye of little faith.

1075
01:31:05,982 --> 01:31:08,582
Russia stands tonight...

1076
01:31:08,622 --> 01:31:11,341
on the brink
of a second revolution.

1077
01:31:11,381 --> 01:31:13,824
As the number of deaths
from freezing mounts...

1078
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:15,743
hundreds of thousands
of protesters...

1079
01:31:15,783 --> 01:31:17,862
have taken to the streets.

1080
01:31:17,902 --> 01:31:19,464
Even as
Russian President Karpov...

1081
01:31:19,504 --> 01:31:21,664
is promising
a mysterious solution...

1082
01:31:21,704 --> 01:31:23,544
to the crippling
heating-oil shortage...

1083
01:31:23,584 --> 01:31:25,706
troops opposed
to the elected government...

1084
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:27,950
and led
by General Leo Sklarov...

1085
01:31:27,985 --> 01:31:30,666
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

1086
01:31:30,706 --> 01:31:32,587
Angry, frightened citizens...

1087
01:31:32,627 --> 01:31:35,306
are gathering outside
the Kremlin in Red Square...

1088
01:31:35,346 --> 01:31:37,106
but they're not braving
the bitter cold...

1089
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:39,146
for yet another political rally.

1090
01:31:39,186 --> 01:31:42,505
They've been drawn here by
the promise of a revelation...

1091
01:31:42,545 --> 01:31:43,905
whatever that may be...

1092
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:46,348
in what's become
a life-and-death struggle...

1093
01:31:46,388 --> 01:31:49,267
for the future
of democracy in Russia.

1094
01:33:01,597 --> 01:33:04,316
Mr. President?
I'm your friend.

1095
01:33:04,351 --> 01:33:06,077
What do you want?

1096
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,038
I want to help you
to destroy Tretiak.

1097
01:33:11,078 --> 01:33:12,798
I need you to listen
for about 30 seconds.

1098
01:33:14,558 --> 01:33:17,237
I'm all right. Stay outside.

1099
01:33:17,277 --> 01:33:19,197
Please, continue.

1100
01:33:19,237 --> 01:33:22,519
Tonight you'll stand trial
in Red Square before the world.

1101
01:33:22,554 --> 01:33:25,801
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

1102
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:27,321
Agree with this criminal?

1103
01:33:27,361 --> 01:33:30,119
If you want
to destroy Tretiak... yes.

1104
01:33:46,602 --> 01:33:48,720
Gruschev,
take Mr. Karpov downstairs.

1105
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,920
The wife stays here.

1106
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:55,323
Get your hands off!
What you are doing is illegal!

1107
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,242
The people won't stand for it!

1108
01:33:57,282 --> 01:34:00,604
The people are too cold
to stop it. Who are you?

1109
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:16,966
Tretiak!
Tretiak! Tretiak!

1110
01:34:31,728 --> 01:34:33,767
Friends...

1111
01:34:33,807 --> 01:34:35,647
countrymen...

1112
01:34:35,690 --> 01:34:37,770
Russians!

1113
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:51,209
You heard about this morning's
sensational events.

1114
01:34:51,249 --> 01:34:54,249
Many shocking documents
were recovered...

1115
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:56,453
from the president's
secret files...

1116
01:34:56,493 --> 01:34:59,016
locked within his private safe.

1117
01:34:59,051 --> 01:35:03,812
The documents which will be
published in today's papers...

1118
01:35:03,852 --> 01:35:07,979
prove that the traitor Karpov...

1119
01:35:08,014 --> 01:35:11,732
was about to steal
over 40 trillion...

1120
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:14,535
of our precious
Russian rubles...

1121
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:19,054
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

1122
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:20,974
To add insult...

1123
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:23,853
millions of dollars
were to be paid...

1124
01:35:23,888 --> 01:35:26,855
to this international criminal!

1125
01:35:33,537 --> 01:35:35,496
And for what
was your president...

1126
01:35:35,536 --> 01:35:39,503
hoping to bankrupt
our national treasury?

1127
01:35:39,538 --> 01:35:44,478
What you see is a fairy tale
called cold fusion.

1128
01:35:44,513 --> 01:35:49,418
You pass electric current
into the machine...

1129
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:53,539
and there is supposed
to be a chemical reaction.

1130
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:55,097
Watch.

1131
01:35:55,137 --> 01:35:58,620
It can't even light up
a tiny light bulb!

1132
01:35:58,659 --> 01:36:01,020
Do you dare deny this,
Mr. Karpov?

1133
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:03,180
Absolutely not!

1134
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,425
I proudly admit it!

1135
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:08,460
But enough puny failure.

1136
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,539
Failure's in the past!

1137
01:36:10,579 --> 01:36:13,700
Begging is behind us!

1138
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:17,340
The balance of power
is about to shift!

1139
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:51,867
Miracle one.

1140
01:36:56,066 --> 01:37:15,909
Karpov! Karpov!

1141
01:37:22,912 --> 01:37:23,991
Ilya! Ilya!

1142
01:37:24,031 --> 01:37:25,350
Go! Go!

1143
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:26,870
Go, go, go!

1144
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:32,629
I order all troops
loyal to mother Russia...

1145
01:37:32,669 --> 01:37:35,991
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

1146
01:37:41,312 --> 01:37:42,872
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

1147
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:46,151
There was a miscommunication
in the chain of command.

1148
01:37:52,353 --> 01:37:53,715
Miracle two.

1149
01:37:53,795 --> 01:37:56,874
The billionaire
industrialist and his son...

1150
01:37:56,914 --> 01:37:59,354
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison...

1151
01:37:59,394 --> 01:38:03,292
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1152
01:38:03,327 --> 01:38:07,197
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth...

1153
01:38:07,237 --> 01:38:09,395
as millions of gallons
of heating oil...

1154
01:38:09,435 --> 01:38:12,496
flowed from a storage depot
beneath Tretiak's mansion.

1155
01:38:12,531 --> 01:38:15,556
He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1156
01:38:15,596 --> 01:38:17,356
He never had the chance.

1157
01:38:17,396 --> 01:38:18,638
You'll tell us
if he makes contact?

1158
01:38:18,678 --> 01:38:19,797
Yes.

1159
01:38:19,837 --> 01:38:24,396
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1160
01:38:24,436 --> 01:38:27,879
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1161
01:38:27,919 --> 01:38:30,718
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1162
01:38:30,758 --> 01:38:34,437
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint...

1163
01:38:34,477 --> 01:38:36,557
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1164
01:38:36,597 --> 01:38:37,803
Count yourself lucky.

1165
01:38:37,838 --> 01:38:42,119
I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1166
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:44,400
We understand.
You have a life.

1167
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,080
We appreciate
your taking the time.

1168
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:47,560
No problem.

1169
01:38:53,801 --> 01:38:55,722
She's in love with him.

1170
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:06,010
I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1171
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:07,210
It hasn't been safe.

1172
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,768
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1173
01:40:11,929 --> 01:40:16,771
So... have you been busy?

1174
01:40:16,811 --> 01:40:19,253
Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1175
01:40:19,288 --> 01:40:21,657
Thank God I have my cards back.

1176
01:40:21,692 --> 01:40:25,171
You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1177
01:40:25,211 --> 01:40:27,773
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1178
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:30,011
Oh, my God.

1179
01:40:30,051 --> 01:40:31,452
That was you?

1180
01:40:32,415 --> 01:40:34,775
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1181
01:40:35,814 --> 01:40:38,294
I thought you were
some old biddy...

1182
01:40:38,334 --> 01:40:41,573
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1183
01:40:41,613 --> 01:40:44,416
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1184
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:45,534
I am?

1185
01:40:45,574 --> 01:40:48,374
Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1186
01:40:54,576 --> 01:40:55,656
- Emma.
- Yeah?

1187
01:40:55,696 --> 01:40:57,378
My life is very strange.

1188
01:40:58,297 --> 01:40:59,578
I just...

1189
01:41:03,376 --> 01:41:05,459
I don't do anything normal.

1190
01:41:05,499 --> 01:41:06,978
I'm-I can't even-

1191
01:41:07,018 --> 01:41:10,338
I know. I know you.

1192
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:13,816
I know your life.

1193
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,380
- What do you want?
- I want you.

1194
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:18,380
For how long?

1195
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,339
It doesn't matter.

1196
01:41:26,979 --> 01:41:28,619
Tell me you love me.

1197
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,060
I- I love you.

1198
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,221
Simon.

1199
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:37,744
I love you, Simon.

1200
01:41:38,943 --> 01:41:40,902
Miracle three.

1201
01:42:03,465 --> 01:42:05,384
Dear Simon...

1202
01:42:05,424 --> 01:42:08,667
the pin is something
I've kept for years.

1203
01:42:08,707 --> 01:42:11,986
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1204
01:42:12,026 --> 01:42:14,466
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1205
01:42:14,506 --> 01:42:16,864
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1206
01:42:16,904 --> 01:42:18,945
something I loved.

1207
01:42:18,985 --> 01:42:21,749
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1208
01:42:21,788 --> 01:42:24,427
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1209
01:42:24,467 --> 01:42:26,549
and so I hope you'll understand.

1210
01:42:26,589 --> 01:42:30,028
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1211
01:42:30,068 --> 01:42:33,270
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1212
01:42:33,310 --> 01:42:36,068
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1213
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:39,791
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1214
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:44,750
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1215
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:47,910
If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1216
01:42:47,950 --> 01:42:50,190
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1217
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:53,871
will accomplish anything...
you're absolutely right.

1218
01:42:56,591 --> 01:42:58,473
Simon, what are you doing here?

1219
01:42:58,513 --> 01:43:00,872
There are police.

1220
01:43:00,912 --> 01:43:02,311
They're everywhere.

1221
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:04,594
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1222
01:43:04,634 --> 01:43:07,553
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

1223
01:43:11,355 --> 01:43:12,475
You better go.

1224
01:43:25,836 --> 01:43:27,115
How will I find you?

1225
01:43:29,074 --> 01:43:31,797
I'll find you. You found me.

1226
01:43:57,839 --> 01:44:00,798
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1227
01:44:00,838 --> 01:44:05,200
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1228
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:09,482
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1229
01:44:09,522 --> 01:44:13,242
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1230
01:44:13,282 --> 01:44:16,163
No.

1231
01:44:16,203 --> 01:44:17,922
Dr. Russell?

1232
01:44:26,601 --> 01:44:29,404
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1233
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:31,003
Thank you. Good morning.

1234
01:44:31,043 --> 01:44:32,482
No.

1235
01:44:32,522 --> 01:44:36,564
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1236
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:39,443
a difficult childhood.

1237
01:44:39,483 --> 01:44:42,005
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1238
01:44:42,045 --> 01:44:43,924
bastards, at best.

1239
01:44:43,963 --> 01:44:48,888
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1240
01:44:50,326 --> 01:44:52,566
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1241
01:44:52,606 --> 01:44:55,166
I'm her biggest fan.

1242
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,890
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1243
01:44:57,925 --> 01:45:00,847
Even though
some of you may feel...

1244
01:45:00,887 --> 01:45:04,486
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1245
01:45:04,526 --> 01:45:08,608
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1246
01:45:08,648 --> 01:45:09,727
becoming a reality.

1247
01:45:09,767 --> 01:45:13,130
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1248
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:15,049
Look at the time.
Got to go.

1249
01:45:15,089 --> 01:45:18,571
...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1250
01:45:18,611 --> 01:45:21,490
we can all work towards
making the-the...

1251
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:26,889
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1252
01:45:50,095 --> 01:45:51,176
Quickly!

1253
01:45:51,216 --> 01:45:52,975
We got him!

1254
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,854
Hyah!

1255
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:58,214
Hands behind your back!

1256
01:45:58,254 --> 01:46:00,253
Got you, you slippery-

1257
01:46:00,293 --> 01:46:01,493
What's going on?

1258
01:46:07,495 --> 01:46:08,697
Damn!

1259
01:46:15,378 --> 01:46:17,218
Donations totaling
three billion dollars...

1260
01:46:17,258 --> 01:46:18,737
were made today
to the Red Cross...

1261
01:46:18,777 --> 01:46:19,858
the Salvation Army...

1262
01:46:19,898 --> 01:46:22,179
and the United Nations
Children's Fund.

1263
01:46:22,219 --> 01:46:23,859
The funds were wired
from the account...

1264
01:46:23,899 --> 01:46:26,858
of jailed Russian tycoon
Ivan Tretiak.

1265
01:46:26,898 --> 01:46:28,778
In other philanthropic news...

1266
01:46:28,818 --> 01:46:31,056
a nonprofit
research foundation...

1267
01:46:31,096 --> 01:46:35,059
has been established to develop
cold fusion technology...

1268
01:46:35,094 --> 01:46:37,260
funded with
an anonymous donation...

1269
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,180
and to be headed by Russian
physicist Dr. Lev Botvin.

1270
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:43,540
The E.J. Russell Foundation...

1271
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:45,460
is charged to develop
inexpensive...
