Hey!

11
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,100
- Me?
- Yes.

12
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
What?

13
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
You're retarded, aren't you?

14
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,400
The field of sunflowers is gone.

15
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
It's changed a lot.

16
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,700
I can't believe this.

17
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,300
My mom's out now.

18
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,200
Come back tonight.

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,700
I have nowhere to go.

20
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,800
You said you're from here.
No friends?

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,700
Go to a sauna then.

22
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,600
You mean a public bathhouse?

23
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,900
<i>Going to a public bathhouse</i>

24
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,800
Damn.

25
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,200
Stop playing with that thing.

26
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
It's a delicate sensor.

27
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,600
You'll break it.

28
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Okay, I won't.
I'm sorry.

29
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,700
You should know better.

30
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
No wonder it keeps breaking.

31
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,700
You have no idea
how expensive it is.

32
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,500
If broken...
Are you loaded?

33
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,800
You'll pay for it?

34
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Huh?

35
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,500
I've never used it before.

36
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm sorry.

37
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,500
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,700
Who is that asshole with?

39
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,300
He's one of Changmu's boys.

40
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Did they report it in?

41
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
No.

42
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Things are crazy around here.

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,200
I should ask for a transfer.

44
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,300
Changmu and Yangki...

45
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,100
They're bickering
over that Club Oracle.

46
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,100
You have to hold your mind.
There's war brewing.

47
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,600
I hear they were friends,
weren't they?

48
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,200
Thugs can never be friends.

49
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,600
They knew each other
when they were nothing.

50
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's go.

51
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,100
What about her?

52
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,700
They didn't call it in.

53
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,300
We're shorthanded.
We got no time for that.

54
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,000
And it's time to eat.

55
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,100
She must've done something bad.

56
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,000
- Let's go!
- Okay.

57
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,300
Sugary carbonic acid gas.

58
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,700
Caramel, phosphoric acid.

59
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,500
A lot of good stuff in it.
Gulp it down.

60
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,800
Drink it.

61
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
Why aren't you?

62
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,100
Drink it, assholes.

63
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,200
Hitting you is useless
and so ignorant.

64
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,200
I've decided to change.

65
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,800
Damn, look at you.
You're pathetic.

66
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Haven't I told you?

67
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,900
Once Club Oracle is completed,
we're done suffering.

68
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,900
Until then, do your job right.

69
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,100
You got that?

70
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,100
Right?

71
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
Changmu?

72
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,400
Who the fuck is this?

73
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,100
Fuck.

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Taesik!

75
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,600
- When'd you get out?
- This morning.

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,200
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up.

77
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll go.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Go where?

79
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,300
I just wanted to drop by
and say hello.

80
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
You seem quite busy.

81
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,700
Where are you going?

82
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,400
To see Yangki.

83
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,300
- You don't have to see me out.
- It's okay.

84
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,900
Happy to see you're doing well.
Bye.

85
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,000
Call me if you need anything.

86
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,700
Bye.

87
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
Asshole.

88
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,300
I should leave you alone?
Whatever you do?

89
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,600
Fuck you.

90
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,300
Keep an eye on him.

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,700
Okay, Boss.

92
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,200
Sir!

93
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
We're closed.

94
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,700
I thought you drowned
at the sauna.

95
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,300
Mom's been waiting.

96
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Whatever.

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,400
Dukja, come out here.

98
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,200
What?

99
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,800
You've been waiting for him.

100
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,500
He's here.

101
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,800
What?

102
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I totally forgot!

103
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,000
You're home, Taesik.

104
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Let me look at you.

105
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
- How are you?
- Fine.

106
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,700
It must've been hard.
Did you eat?

107
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,500
Tell me what you feel like.

108
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,200
It's okay, Ma'am.

109
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,800
Get out.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,100
What?

111
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,700
Get out and don't come back.

112
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Where...

113
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,400
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,700
Sorry for what?

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm sorry, Mother.

116
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,900
Close the shop.

117
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,700
What do you feel like?

118
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
Some meat?

119
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,400
Welcome home.

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,500
Here.

121
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll help myself.

122
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,000
Come on.

123
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
Good.

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,300
That's good.

125
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,600
I can't believe this.

126
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
Dukja, are you happy?

127
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,500
Better watch it.

128
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,200
Don't call me by my name again.

129
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,800
Or what?

130
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,200
This! How about it?

131
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,900
Damn.

132
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
Where are you going?

133
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
To get some water, Dukja!

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,200
Can't you see that?

135
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,500
What?

136
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,000
God, you're choking.

137
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,300
Spit it out.

138
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,500
Come on, spit it out.

139
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,900
Listen.

140
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
This is your room now.

141
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,600
My brother...

142
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,500
Anyway, we fixed it up
with a new boiler.

143
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,900
You'll find it comfortable.

144
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,000
I'll do the laundry for you.

145
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,600
You clean the bathroom
and feed the dog.

146
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,500
Follow me.

147
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,800
Don't expect me to treat you
like a real brother.

148
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm known for being mean.

149
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,700
- Okay?
- Sure.

150
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,800
I don't know the story
between you and my mom.

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
But I don't like you.

152
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,900
And I don't like living

153
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,600
with a total stranger.

154
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,300
I was so against the idea.

155
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,700
But I gave in to her
because it was her wish.

156
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,700
You should thank me.

157
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,700
Thanks.

158
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Even if I bother you, suck it up.

159
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
Or move out.

160
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
I'll suck it up.

161
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,900
Here's a piece of advice
for your pathetic life.

162
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Being dumb isn't just bad.
It's a crime.

163
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,600
It makes others suffer.
Got it?

164
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,900
I'll never drink again.

165
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,200
I'll never fight again.

166
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,800
I'll never cry again.

167
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Wake up.

168
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Get the hell up.

169
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,700
Get up now! I'm late.

170
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,800
Okay.

171
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,800
What is it?

172
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I forgot to give you the keys.

173
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,900
Lock the door if you go out.

174
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,300
There isn't much to steal, though.

175
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Here.

176
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
Why are you looking at me
like that?

177
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
Never seen a pretty girl?

178
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,900
Bye!
Have fun with yourself.

179
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,000
Congratulations on your election.

180
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
We expect a lot from you.

181
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,900
We're counting on you.

182
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Don't you worry.

183
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll have the market renovated

184
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,400
and bring back customers.

185
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,700
Thank you so much!

186
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,100
Development doesn't happen
for itself.

187
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,500
It takes us to abandon the old
and welcome the new.

188
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,600
That's right!

189
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,900
I will never disappoint you!

190
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,700
- Cho Pansu! Cho Pansu!
- Thank you!

191
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,400
Thank you!

192
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,200
It's disgusting.

193
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Let's get out of here.

194
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,200
It stinks.

195
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,800
Hey, we're back.

196
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,400
How are you?

197
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
What are you doing here?

198
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,000
- What?
- What brought you here?

199
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,900
I was told to report to...

200
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Not that.

201
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Why'd you come back here?

202
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,900
I know Korea is freaking small.

203
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
But why?

204
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,700
Why here?

205
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,300
Don't you know me?

206
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,300
We went to middle school together.

207
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't remember?

208
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,300
You bullied me like crazy!

209
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,800
If I were you,
I wouldn't have come back.

210
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,700
People here don't like you.

211
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,600
I'm saying this for your sake.
Leave town.

212
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,400
I'll be good. Trust me.

213
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,300
You will?

214
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,200
If you say so...

215
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll be watching you.
Don't cause any trouble.

216
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

217
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,400
I said no basketball on duty!

218
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,500
We're on a lunch break.

219
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,300
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

220
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
- I'm off to lunch.
- Okay.

221
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,100
I got it when I was younger...

222
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,400
...to intimidate people.

223
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,900
Now I think it looks horrible.

224
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,400
Right.

225
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,300
It's absolutely a turnoff.

226
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,200
- What?
- A turnoff.

227
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,100
So, what is it that you want?

228
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,200
You know what.

229
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,300
Is it possible?

230
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,800
It's a work of art.

231
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Why don't you leave it?

232
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
No.

233
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,000
If you want it erased,
it can be done.

234
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
But it'll leave a trace.

235
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,600
And it costs a lot of money.

236
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,400
How much?

237
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,100
It's 30 by 50, so...

238
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,200
I can't give you
an exact number now.

239
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,900
But I'm sure it's a lot.

240
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,500
A lot.

241
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,600
What if...

242
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,900
Never seen anything like this?

243
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,400
Of course not.

244
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,400
Think of me as a guinea pig
and do it for free?

245
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,700
We're not social workers.

246
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,300
No!

247
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
I don't think
that's gonna work.

248
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
<i>I'll make life easier for you
City Councilor Cho Pansu</i>

249
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,800
- You can't go in!
- Let go!

250
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
I don't need an appointment!

251
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,700
You can't see him
without an appointment!

252
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,600
- I need to talk to him!
- What's wrong with you?

253
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
What's the matter?

254
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,500
She forced herself in to see you.

255
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
It's been a while.

256
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,100
You can leave us.

257
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,500
Yes, sir.

258
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,000
Sunflower Lady,
what can I do for you?

259
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,500
I'll make it short.

260
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll never sell you my restaurant.

261
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,700
So don't bother.

262
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,200
I'm doing everything I can
to develop our community.

263
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,700
You got a hearing problem?

264
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,800
Stop bothering us
by sending those thugs.

265
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,200
Or I'll bite back.

266
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,900
You play a nice daddy
for your kids?

267
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm sure
they'll learn a lot from you.

268
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
Bastard!

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,200
Everybody on earth is bad.

270
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,100
You're old enough to know that.

271
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,600
Son?

272
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,400
It's hard to get a job these days.

273
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,700
Why don't you work here?

274
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,900
I'll pay you.

275
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,800
What? No?

276
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,500
- Taesik got a job?
- Yes.

277
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,300
At Wellbeing Garage
down the street.

278
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Wellbeing Garage?

279
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Has he gone insane?

280
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,900
And he went to the hospital
to have the tattoo erased.

281
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
What?

282
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,000
And he's living
with that Sunflower Lady?

283
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,800
What the hell is he up to?

284
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,700
Who says you can come up here?

285
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,400
This is the only place of mine
on earth.

286
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,200
Get down now.

287
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
What are you hiding?

288
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,700
Oh, cigarettes.

289
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Fine, you can smoke.

290
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,200
Go ahead.

291
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,900
Is it good?

292
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,500
You're pathetic.

293
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,600
Quit smoking.

294
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
I hate the smell.

295
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,800
Leave now.

296
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
Leave.

297
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
Can't you call me brother?

298
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,300
I told you not to expect that.

299
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
I can be a good brother.

300
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,500
But I can't be a good sister.

301
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,000
What happened to your face?

302
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
My face?

303
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,800
There's only one reason for it.

304
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
What's that?

305
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
I'm too pretty.

306
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,600
The world won't leave me alone.

307
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,600
It's so tiring.

308
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm used to it, though.

309
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>smoking</i>

310
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
- Hey
- Yeah?

311
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,200
That's Oh Taesik.

312
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,500
Both Changmu and
Yangki were scared of him.

313
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,900
No kidding.

314
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,400
He looks docile.

315
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,000
He got kicked out of high school,

316
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,400
and started causing trouble.

317
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,900
Back then,
Choi Dopil ruled the town.

318
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,200
But he couldn't stop that ass.

319
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,600
Within 2 years,
he lost his turf to him.

320
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,500
Then Yangki and Changmu
were his underlings.

321
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,700
That was 10 years ago.
Damn, time flies.

322
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,800
Look, it's raining.

323
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,900
The sun is out,
and it's raining?

324
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,500
- You tell me.
- It feels cool, though.

325
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,400
What were you doing 10 years ago?

326
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Me? Nothing much.

327
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,800
You know what he did then?

328
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,400
When drunk, he becomes a beast.

329
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,700
Dopil didn't know that
and gathered up his boys...

330
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
...to get rid of him.
But he ended up dead.

331
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,800
Look at him drink.

332
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
That's a lot.

333
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
It's about to begin.

334
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,300
That's right.
Right, left, and a front kick!

335
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
Doesn't it feel so real?

336
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,800
Throw him!

337
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
A spin kick!

338
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
He evades the knife and holds him.

339
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,500
He twists his arm
and goes in for a kill!

340
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
That's how he died.

341
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,600
Oh, that's what happened.

342
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,200
Here come Yangki and Changmu.

343
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,600
Look at them.
They couldn't look more scared.

344
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,500
After Taesik went to jail,
everybody thought...

345
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,100
...either Yangki or Changmu
would take it over.

346
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,900
But this guy named Byungjin
who limps because of Taesik...

347
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,400
...teamed up with Cho Pansu
who was a pimp then...

348
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,100
...and took over town.

349
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,000
What's going on?

350
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,600
What is it?

351
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,400
That's Cho Pansu!
That's him!

352
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,600
Byungjin was stupid.

353
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,800
Yangki and Changmu
alleged loyalty to Cho Pansu.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,900
Byungjin thought
he'd be ruling the town.

355
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,100
But he thought wrong.

356
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,100
The rain is stopping.

357
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,900
It looks as if we staged this.

358
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,700
It's stopped.

359
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

360
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,100
That's what happened.

361
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,400
And he's back.

362
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,500
Trust me.
He'll fuck up big time soon.

363
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,300
- Get out.
- What for?

364
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,800
We'll do some interview.

365
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,800
When he first showed up,
I was so nervous.

366
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,200
I even prayed for him to leave.

367
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,300
But he begged me for a job.

368
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,900
And I couldn't say no.

369
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,400
I didn't want him
to hold a grudge against me.

370
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,700
Right.

371
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,000
So I thought I'd fire him
if he wasn't any good.

372
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,600
But he works so hard.

373
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,800
I hate those who goof around,

374
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,200
but love those hard workers.

375
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,800
Taesik is good.

376
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,800
- What about drinking?
- Right.

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,300
Not at all.

378
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,200
We all went drinking
and asked him to drink some.

379
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
He didn't.

380
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,400
He's changed. Very nice.

381
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,700
I can't believe it.

382
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,500
We're working here.

383
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,700
What's that?

384
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,500
Where are you going?

385
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,500
Have Taesik help you.

386
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm not a slave.

387
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,400
Get back here!

388
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
You haven't taken care of that?

389
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,700
We're not building the mall?

390
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,200
We've bought all the land
around it, asshole!

391
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,800
When will the construction finish?

392
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,100
In about 3 weeks.

393
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,700
It makes me so crazy!

394
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,400
I'm gonna crazy.

395
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
Why should I step in
to get anything done?

396
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,800
Get the boys tonight.

397
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,300
Yes, sir.

398
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,600
When X falls in between 0 and 2,
what's g (t)?

399
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,000
It's 1.

400
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,600
When X falls between 2 and 3...

401
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,200
...g (t) is square (t-1).

402
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,900
Let's use the formula.

403
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,000
From integral 0 to 3,
gt, dt is...

404
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,400
From integral 0 to 2, 1dt plus

405
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,900
Integral 2 to 3 is
square (t-1) and dt.

406
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,000
So if you calculate this,
1 is t and 0 to 2...

407
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,900
How important do you think
infinitesimal calculus is in life?

408
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,200
That depends on
what kind of life you live.

409
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,900
For what you want in life?
You should know it.

410
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,300
What's he doing here?

411
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,400
What are you doing here?

412
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
You didn't come to pick me up.

413
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,900
What's that?
You'll study here?

414
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
You wanna go to college?

415
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,800
- Yes.
- What?

416
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,900
What for?

417
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,200
Why can't I?

418
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
No, I'm just saying...

419
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Sure, why not.

420
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,400
You can't be too old to study.
It's my bad.

421
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
Taking all the courses?

422
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,200
No, just English.

423
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,700
Just English?
What about the others?

424
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,500
I'm good at other subjects,

425
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,400
but not English.

426
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,500
What about math?
You'll just pick answers?

427
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,500
I'm good at math.

428
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,200
You're good at math?

429
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
But you're dumb.

430
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,900
- Can you do integral calculus?
- Yes.

431
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,300
What?

432
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
You can do integral calculus?
Don't lie to me.

433
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,500
Taesik!

434
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,500
I went to see you in jail.

435
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Why'd you refuse to see me?

436
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Just because...

437
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,300
So you've become a teacher.

438
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
I wanted to see you once and for all.

439
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,000
You did? Why?

440
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,300
To tell you I'm sorry.

441
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,200
That's all?

442
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,200
Nothing else?

443
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What else do I have to tell you
except that?

444
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,700
What are you looking at?

445
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,400
Can't you see?
Done talking to her?

446
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,800
Yes, I thought you'd be waiting.

447
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Why would I wait for you?
Am I nuts?

448
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,000
That's a portable multimedia player.

449
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Okay?

450
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,800
I don't know.

451
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,300
You can take pictures, play music,
and watch movies with it.

452
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
What?

453
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,900
- You're lying.
- It's true.

454
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Knock it off.
What do you take me for?

455
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm not stupid.

456
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,700
Fool!

457
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,300
- You can do integral calculus?
- Yes.

458
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,000
How do you do it?

459
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,000
Do the differential backwards.

460
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I know that!

461
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,400
How do you do it backwards?

462
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
You just do it.

463
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,300
You!

464
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,900
What's wrong with this?
There's no taste to it.

465
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,500
It's pretty good.

466
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,100
You can eat it all.

467
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,900
Hey, check them out.

468
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
What?

469
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,600
Isn't that the girl
you have a crush on?

470
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,000
How do you do differentials?

471
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,800
Do integral calculus backwards.

472
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,200
Are you kidding me?

473
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
No, I'm...

474
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,000
Asshole!

475
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,900
Get up, asshole.
Get up.

476
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,700
Get the hell up.

477
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Son of bitch!

478
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,600
You piece of shit.

479
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,600
She's mine.
I've been eyeing her for 2 years.

480
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,900
And you're hitting on her?

481
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,200
You're totally mistaken.

482
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,500
Mistaken my ass!

483
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,100
You stop me?

484
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,900
Cut it out!

485
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,700
Let go!

486
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,400
What the...

487
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,500
Stop it!

488
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,800
What's going on
between you and this ass?

489
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,600
Stop hitting him!

490
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Damn, I'm pissed.

491
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,500
What should I do with him?

492
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,300
Look, asshole.

493
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,700
<i>I love Huiju See this?</i>

494
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,500
Can you see this?

495
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You stole money from others
and got that tattoo?

496
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,100
You're really something.

497
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,600
- What the...
- How touching.

498
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
You won't see her again, right?

499
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Right?

500
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,700
Huiju, you disappointed me.

501
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
You know I love you.

502
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,200
I don't like you!

503
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,600
You'll love me eventually.

504
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,300
Leave her alone, will you?

505
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,400
What?

506
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
What'd you just say?

507
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,600
You know what?
You're digging your grave.

508
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Hey!

509
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,600
Sure.

510
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey!

511
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,900
It's been a while, Huiju.

512
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,200
- I don't like you.
- I missed you, babe.

513
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,100
This is a joke.

514
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,400
Fucker!

515
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,400
Hey!

516
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,500
What?

517
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,200
It's an ointment.

518
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,200
What do you say?

519
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,900
Thanks.

520
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,600
Don't tell mom
what happened today.

521
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,700
I don't want her to freak out.

522
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,000
And...

523
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,900
How do you know the math teacher?

524
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,100
Long time ago...

525
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,400
You dated her?

526
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,500
I knew her.

527
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,000
Congratulations on your election
as city councilor.

528
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,600
Maybe you should run
for Congress.

529
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,000
Rushing things is never good.
One step at a time.

530
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,400
My next goal is mayor.

531
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,800
I'll serve you with my life.

532
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm counting on you.

533
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,500
Sure.

534
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,500
Hey, Changmu.

535
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,000
Sit down and drink.

536
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,700
There you go, Changmu.
You're the man.

537
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,500
I like that.

538
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,800
I know you boys are busy.
I'll get to the point.

539
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,600
It's about Club Oracle.

540
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,900
I expect one of you boys to help me.

541
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,800
I'll do my best, sir.

542
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,700
It's not running a super market.

543
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,700
It'll be the biggest club in town.

544
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,200
I have the right business mind.

545
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,800
I'll never disappoint you.

546
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,800
I have the business mind, too.

547
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,700
I'll make it full of pretty girls.

548
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,700
And I'll book popular singers
and comedians.

549
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,400
The most important thing is
to hire the right waiters.

550
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm sure it'll do well
whoever runs it.

551
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,400
What about the Sunflower Restaurant?

552
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,200
Didn't I tell you
that I needed that land?

553
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,300
I'm doing my best.

554
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,900
You should've given me the job.

555
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,800
If she doesn't listen,
I'll bulldoze the place.

556
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,300
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

557
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,600
Yeah, you do that.

558
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:53,200
You're too soft.
Not good for the business.

559
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,300
Make it smooth, okay?

560
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200
The business mind?

561
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,900
What a talker you are.

562
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,600
Oracle is mine, okay?

563
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,700
I don't know if you...

564
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,400
What?

565
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,000
Nothing.

566
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,300
I'll take care of
that restaurant...

567
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,800
...and take over Oracle.

568
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Okay?

569
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,300
It's a piece of cake.

570
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,200
I hate those without manners.

571
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,200
Go say hello.

572
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,500
Okay.

573
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,300
Taesik!

574
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
Stop it, guys!
Stop it!

575
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,700
They're your boys?

576
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,700
- Well...
- Why?

577
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,600
What are you doing here?

578
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,800
Why?

579
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,800
It's just...

580
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,800
Leave.
It's my mother's place.

581
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Your mother's?

582
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,700
What are you doing?

583
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,500
- Taesik.
- Leave.

584
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
Don't get me wrong.

585
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,600
Leave.

586
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,500
Okay, I'll leave.

587
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,800
Let's go.

588
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,500
Shit, I almost got fucked.

589
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,000
Come on, let's go!

590
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,500
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

591
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,000
What did they want?

592
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,300
You don't need to know.
It's nothing.

593
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,900
You know Taesik was there.

594
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,500
You wanted me to get fucked?

595
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,100
You never listen to me.

596
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
I should fucking kill you.

597
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,900
Watch your mouth, asshole.

598
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,800
What the fuck!

599
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
What's important is...

600
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,300
...what he has in mind, okay?

601
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,600
You think he's back for nothing?

602
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,700
What if he's with the Mob
from Seoul...

603
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,700
...and wants to take over
our town?

604
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Even Mr. Cho can't stop him.

605
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,100
If so, we're screwed.

606
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,900
But I'm friends with him.

607
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,800
How many times
did you visit him in jail?

608
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,000
Not once, right?

609
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,400
I did 5 times for 10 years.

610
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,400
You call yourself a friend?

611
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,500
Fuck you.

612
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,500
I heard you, asshole.

613
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,500
Didn't he say he would destroy it?

614
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,400
What the hell did he do?

615
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,100
Sir, there's a problem.

616
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,300
What?

617
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,200
You should know, too.

618
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
Go ahead.

619
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,400
Neither Changmu nor Yangki
can touch that place...

620
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,900
...because of Oh Taesik.

621
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,600
Who's that?

622
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,600
Don't you remember?

623
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,300
Oh Taesik from 10 years ago.

624
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,900
One who whacked Dopil?

625
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,100
He's back in town
and you didn't tell me?

626
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Keeping an eye on him...

627
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,300
...to see...

628
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,600
...what cards he has hidden...

629
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,300
...to put on the table?

630
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
That's not it.

631
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,100
No?

632
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,700
We've been watching him.

633
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,300
- He's done with this field...
- This field?

634
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,100
What's wrong with this field?

635
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,700
What's wrong with it?

636
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,800
Help yourself.

637
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,100
He's tougher than he looks.
Be nice.

638
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,900
Come here, eat.

639
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,800
You do integral calculus well?

640
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
- A little bit.
- You said you were good at it.

641
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,500
I am.

642
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,800
This is how it works.

643
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,500
I can't believe this.

644
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,000
You didn't finish high school
and are better than me.

645
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,700
When I was in jail,
there was this math teacher.

646
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,200
He started teaching me
to kill time.

647
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,200
I was a cell leader,
and he was nice to me.

648
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,300
So he was like your tutor.

649
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,800
Right.

650
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,500
I see.

651
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400
But no English teacher?

652
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,000
I waited for one, but none came.

653
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,200
What did that teacher do?

654
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,500
He took kickbacks from parents?

655
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,900
You don't need to know.

656
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,500
Tell me, or I'll hit you.

657
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,500
- Adultery.
- Adultery?

658
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,800
You know love is no sin.

659
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
What's integral calculus?

660
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,700
Doing differential backwards.

661
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,900
Give me a break.

662
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,800
How come I understand differential...

663
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,400
...not integral calculus?

664
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,500
Being dumb...

665
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,500
It's a sin and makes others suffer.

666
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,300
What the... Is that a joke?

667
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,200
You're laughing at me?

668
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,900
You think you're something
because you're better at math?

669
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,100
No.

670
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,300
I'm sorry I was nice to you.

671
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,300
And don't smile like that.

672
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Looking stupid is your concept,
isn't it?

673
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,800
What's that?

674
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,300
You don't know?

675
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,100
Oh, you don't know English.

676
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,700
You're dead.
Go get an English book!

677
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,400
Not studying?

678
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,800
I did.

679
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Listen to yourself.

680
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,200
You can never study enough.

681
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,500
Without studying hard,
you can't make it in life.

682
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,200
Mother?

683
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,200
Taesik, what is it?

684
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,600
Can I come in?

685
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,500
Sure, come in.

686
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Sit here.

687
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,000
What's going on?
What is that?

688
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,200
I got my first paycheck today.

689
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,900
So I bought you something.

690
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:19,300
You should've saved it
for your future.

691
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,500
- What is it?
- Don't touch it.

692
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,600
I've never done this before.

693
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,700
I don't know if you like them.

694
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,100
God...

695
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,700
How could I wear these?

696
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,400
Thank you.

697
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,700
No, I owe you so much.
Thank you.

698
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,700
Let me give you...

699
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,100
When will I get a job...

700
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,700
...and do what he did?

701
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,400
Damn, I should age fast.

702
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,900
I told you not to come up here.

703
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,300
Should I leave?

704
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,600
You can have your smoke.

705
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,700
Trying to suck up to both
mother and daughter?

706
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,500
Mom promised to buy me this.

707
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,000
Fine then.

708
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
You can watch TV on it.

709
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,100
I'm going.

710
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,800
Smoke.

711
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,300
I quit.

712
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,600
Why?

713
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,300
You hate the smell.

714
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,300
Huh?

715
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,900
You're quite character.
My gift...

716
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,400
<i>Buying gifts</i>

717
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,600
So that's it?

718
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,200
That's what it is.

719
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,300
Come here.

720
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,000
You're so cute.

721
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,500
What?

722
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,200
That's a dragon.

723
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,400
And a bamboo.

724
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,800
<i>Oh Taesik</i>

725
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,900
What's this?

726
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,300
Huiju, no!

727
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
Let me see.

728
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,600
'I won't drink.'
'I won't fight.'

729
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,200
'I won't cry.'

730
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,200
Mom gave you this?

731
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,500
She's really something.

732
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,800
This is so funny.

733
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:52,200
'Peeing on the street.
Getting full from coke.'

734
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,100
'Getting hair dyed.'

735
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,500
They're all boring.

736
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,600
- Give it back.
- Wait.

737
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,300
What's this?

738
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,600
'Kissing my breath out.'

739
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,500
Fine, I'll give you this one.

740
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,800
Here!

741
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,500
<i>Going on a picnic</i>

742
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,600
<i>Closed.</i>

743
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,100
It's ripe.

744
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,900
I finally got to understand
integral calculus.

745
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,500
You said you hated math
because of that.

746
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,200
Taesik taught me how to do it.

747
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,400
He taught you?

748
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,200
He's good at math.

749
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,500
He wants to go to college.

750
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,400
Really?

751
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,700
He's really something.

752
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,300
Son!

753
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,300
If you get into college,
the tuition is on me.

754
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,100
Go, Taesik!

755
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,400
Come eat some melon.

756
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Give me a minute.

757
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,400
Come on now. Eat some.

758
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,300
Pretty good.

759
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,100
Wait for your brother!
Put it down.

760
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,700
What?

761
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
Hold still.

762
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,600
Come on, it's my favorite.

763
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,700
'Princess can't sleep.'

764
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,400
- Princess what?
- Listen to it.

765
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,200
She's officially crazy.

766
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,400
Look into the camera.

767
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,100
Here we go.

768
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,600
- I'm going home.
- Okay, good job today.

769
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,300
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.

770
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,500
Yes.

771
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,800
You live with Sunflower Lady?

772
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,500
Yes.

773
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm sorry about your leg.

774
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,200
No point talking about the past.

775
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,500
Forget about it.

776
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,600
Mr. Cho Pansu...

777
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,600
He wants to build a big mall.

778
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,200
He's bought the field of sunflowers...

779
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,800
...except that restaurant
standing in the middle of it.

780
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,900
That made him very upset.

781
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,700
You know what?

782
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,500
I hope you leave town with her.

783
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,100
Otherwise,
your family will be in trouble.

784
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,100
Cho is a ruthless bastard.

785
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
I hope to not see you again
around here.

786
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:49,200
Tocopherol,
unsaturated fatty acid...

787
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,900
It's good for the system.

788
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,300
Drink it.

789
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
Drink it now!

790
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,900
Gulp it down.

791
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,500
Changmu!

792
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:08,000
I never thought the day would come
for you to visit me here.

793
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,500
We got ourselves a problem.

794
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,200
'We'?

795
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,600
Since when?

796
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,600
But it wasn't Cho who met him.

797
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,200
Who's Byungjin?

798
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,300
Use your head.
That's for thinking.

799
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,800
I do a lot of thinking, too.

800
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,700
Forget it.

801
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:40,100
I think Cho made him an offer.

802
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,500
What would that be?

803
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,000
It can't be anything small.

804
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,300
- Oracle?
- You got it.

805
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,600
What about us?

806
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,000
Changmu.

807
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,200
Stop calling me like that.

808
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,100
Take care of the restaurant.

809
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,700
I'll deal with Taesik.

810
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,000
I'll kill you
if you ever come back.

811
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,300
Okay.

812
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,800
You look so unique.

813
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,600
Sure.

814
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,600
Doesn't it hurt?

815
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
I bet it does.

816
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:49,500
I don't understand
why you want it erased.

817
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,300
It's cool, isn't it?

818
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,400
Like an iguana with skin trouble.

819
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Come on.

820
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:03,100
Send her out.
She's too noisy for me.

821
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,500
Don't you smell meat burning?

822
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,600
What's wrong with you?
Be quiet!

823
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,500
I'm sorry.

824
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,900
Study hard, okay?

825
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,700
What?

826
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,600
Study hard.

827
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:29,600
I hate repeating myself.

828
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,400
Why?

829
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,900
You don't know?

830
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,700
I'm going to a good college.

831
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,800
It'd be good
if we went to school together.

832
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,800
You can be my bodyguard.

833
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:45,200
It's a dangerous world
for pretty girls.

834
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,300
You know I'm pretty.

835
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,600
What, you don't think so?

836
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,800
How much is it?

837
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,800
<i>Going to the same college
with Huiju</i>

838
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,900
Why don't you leave?

839
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,700
We're not thugs.

840
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,100
We don't want any trouble.

841
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Cooperate with us.

842
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,600
To my eyes,
you're nothing but thugs.

843
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,800
So save it and get out.

844
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,800
- Goddammit!
- What?

845
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,800
I'm Lee Changmu.

846
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,200
And I'm about to lose it.

847
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,300
Don't you get it?

848
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:51,300
Lose it or not,
you don't scare me.

849
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,700
Get out, asshole.

850
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,700
- Get out of here.
- Fuck it.

851
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,900
Okay, boys.
We'll do it my way.

852
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,400
Get out!

853
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,600
- Trash it.
- Okay.

854
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,700
Let go, asshole!

855
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,400
What are you doing?

856
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,000
You crazy bitch!

857
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,900
Call the cops, please!

858
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,100
Call the cops!

859
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,800
Bitch!

860
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,700
Changmu, are you okay?

861
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,400
What are you doing?
It's our restaurant!

862
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,600
- Leave us alone!
- What?

863
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,700
What should we do?

864
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,600
I saw it coming.

865
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,700
Let's go.
We have to stop them.

866
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,700
God, I hate this situation!

867
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,600
Wait a little longer.

868
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,700
Hold your horses!
I said wait, didn't I?

869
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,900
Damn, it hurts.

870
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:22,000
That was your daughter, right?
She hit me with a weapon.

871
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,300
A weapon?

872
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,100
What was it then?

873
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,500
She almost killed me with it.

874
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,700
Stop staring at me.

875
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:40,800
Look, we'll call it even today.

876
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,600
Or I'll have her arrested.

877
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,500
I'm very well aware of that area.

878
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
A lot of witnesses.

879
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,400
I'm not bluffing.

880
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,800
You're nothing but trash!

881
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,300
Look here.

882
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,800
This car is 14 years old.

883
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,400
It's been quite well maintained.

884
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,400
Look, it's in good shape.

885
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,900
Come on, let's go!

886
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,200
Huiju?

887
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,600
Mom... Mom...

888
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,000
I gotta go.

889
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,100
What'd you bring him for?
It's nothing.

890
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,700
This is nothing?

891
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,300
God, it's broken.
I don't think they can fix it.

892
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,100
I'm sorry.

893
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,900
It's totally broken.

894
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,900
I'll buy you another one.

895
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,200
No, I don't need it now.

896
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,000
Buy me one
when I get into college.

897
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,300
Okay.

898
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,900
The pictures are good, though.

899
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Bastards...

900
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,100
Let's see who laughs last.

901
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,100
It's Cho Pansu, isn't it?

902
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,600
How do you know that scumbag?

903
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,400
Cheers!

904
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,100
Good job today.

905
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,100
That's how we get things done.

906
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,300
Let's drink.

907
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,000
Hey, Taesik.

908
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,800
I have no business with you.
Let me talk to Mr. Cho.

909
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,900
You're the Oh Taesik, huh?

910
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,400
I've heard about you.

911
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,400
I have a favor to ask of you.

912
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,900
I promised to myself
that I'd never fight again.

913
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,800
Help me keep that promise.

914
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,500
I force you to fight?

915
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,700
What makes you think that?

916
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,500
I was going to ask you help me
with my business.

917
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,100
I have a job.

918
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,900
You should have bigger goals in life.

919
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,600
I'm satisfied now.

920
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,300
My business is legitimate.

921
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,900
Thank you.
But no thanks.

922
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,000
That's a shame.

923
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,400
Do me this favor.

924
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,500
It's a favor?
More like a threat to me.

925
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:56,900
What's so difficult?
We're helping each other.

926
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,000
It's very easy.

927
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,200
We'll set the table.

928
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,600
You arrest him afterwards.

929
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,700
He's on parole.
It'll put him back in jail.

930
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,700
Can you do it?

931
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,300
No problem.
You know I'm good.

932
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,900
What's up?

933
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,500
You don't need to know.

934
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,000
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

935
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,200
Hi.

936
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,800
I hear you guys are good.

937
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,700
You got that right.

938
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,400
What's wrong with it?

939
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,300
I want something special.

940
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,400
Like a flying car in the movie.

941
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,900
Cool, isn't it?

942
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Put wings on my car.

943
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,300
You're kidding.

944
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,600
I am?

945
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,600
I had a burger for lunch.

946
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,200
You think I ate that to joke
with you?

947
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,500
Come on, put wings on my car.

948
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,900
We don't do that here.

949
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,400
Go to a different garage.

950
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,300
A different one?
Where?

951
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,100
You should be able to tell us
where I can have it done.

952
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,100
Where?

953
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,100
Please, don't.

954
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Asshole!

955
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,800
I'm sorry if I offended you.

956
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You're sorry?

957
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,700
This guy is so arrogant.

958
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,400
What are you doing?
Beat him.

959
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,600
I'm sorry.

960
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,300
Sorry my ass!

961
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:53,000
Taesik!
What are you doing?

962
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,600
Stop it!

963
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,600
Taesik!

964
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,300
Why are you doing this?

965
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,100
Stop it!

966
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,800
I'm okay.

967
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,500
Why are you doing this?

968
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,100
I'm okay. I'm okay.

969
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,600
What are you doing?

970
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:30,700
- What are you looking at?
- I'll poke your eyes out.

971
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,100
That's enough.

972
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,800
Let's go.

973
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,700
Are you okay?

974
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,100
Sir.

975
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,700
I'm glad you didn't lose it.

976
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,700
You did well.

977
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,000
Look!
They're leaving?

978
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,600
Who's that stupid ass?

979
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,700
He couldn't get him upset?

980
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,700
Anyway, Taesik has changed a lot.

981
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,700
He would've knocked them out
10 years ago.

982
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,900
5 big ones, and...

983
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,700
Are these all you have?

984
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,000
That's right.

985
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,900
I need more.

986
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,700
Can I order them in sets?

987
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
You didn't know them?

988
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,400
Never seen them before.

989
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,300
No reason?

990
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,400
Right.

991
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,200
It is true.

992
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,000
You did get beat up.

993
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:50,600
When I heard you got beat
by petty thugs...

994
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,300
I didn't believe it, but it's true.

995
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,200
You know him?

996
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:58,100
He's just a kid.

997
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,000
A kid?

998
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,400
You call me a kid?

999
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,700
Watch it.

1000
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,800
Get out of here.
Don't bother my son again.

1001
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,900
Your son my ass.

1002
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,600
I know the whole story.

1003
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:17,900
What a fucked-up family.

1004
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,200
How can you adopt a guy
who whacked your own son?

1005
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,100
You call that a family?

1006
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,300
Shut up.

1007
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,800
You whacked her son, right?

1008
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:33,300
Choi Dopil.

1009
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,500
What? What?

1010
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,500
It's late.

1011
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Go to your room.

1012
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,300
He really killed my brother?

1013
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,700
Did he?

1014
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:21,700
How could you do that?

1015
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:26,800
How could you adopt a man
who killed your son?

1016
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:31,500
Things happen in life.

1017
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,600
It was an accident.

1018
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,200
Still, it was him who killed
my brother.

1019
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,300
After the funeral...

1020
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,300
I went to see him in jail.

1021
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,300
I wanted to ask him...

1022
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:55,300
...what he did to deserve that.

1023
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,500
Then what?

1024
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,600
He started crying,
saying he was sorry.

1025
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:12,000
I'd never seen anybody
cry like that.

1026
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,400
Seeing him cry...

1027
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,300
I realized
he'd just made a mistake.

1028
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,400
And that he wasn't a bad person.

1029
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:33,100
So I visited him a few more times.

1030
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,200
I watched him for 10 years.

1031
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,500
He was a good kid.

1032
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,100
So I decided to make him my son.

1033
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,900
I must be crazy.

1034
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,900
I thought you had quit.

1035
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:24,500
I want to, but it isn't easy.

1036
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,800
I'm sorry.

1037
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,800
I wasn't thinking right.

1038
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,400
I'll leave.

1039
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,700
Take care of your mom.

1040
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,700
What about us?

1041
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,900
Mom and I were happy
to have you with us.

1042
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,600
Now you're leaving?

1043
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,700
You're so funny.

1044
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,500
You come and go as you like?

1045
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,800
Huiju...

1046
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm thankful.

1047
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:12,800
I came to thank you,
and you tell me you're leaving?

1048
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,000
My brother was her son.

1049
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,500
But he was a piece of shit.

1050
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,100
He would beat her for money.

1051
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,700
I was very young
when I heard that he died.

1052
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,200
But I was very happy.

1053
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:44,500
That mom would never be
beaten up by her own son.

1054
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,800
Don't go.

1055
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:54,200
I don't care what others say.

1056
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,300
And mom is happy with you.

1057
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,200
I've never seen her that happy.

1058
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,100
Live with us.

1059
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,300
I'm going down.
Smoke another cigarette.

1060
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,400
I'll call you brother
from now on.

1061
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,600
Brother...

1062
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,400
God, it feels awkward.

1063
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,200
So you're saying...

1064
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,800
I ordered Dopil to hit Taesik.

1065
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:56,100
So one died,
and the other ended up in jail?

1066
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,500
And I cheated Dopil
out of the field of sunflowers?

1067
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,600
If you leave Taesik and us alone,
I'll keep quiet.

1068
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,700
You must be going senile.

1069
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,000
Let's say that's true.

1070
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,700
Why make an issue out of it now,
not 10 years ago?

1071
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,400
If even you gave an order,
it was my son who did it.

1072
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,900
It's my son's diary.

1073
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:32,000
I couldn't care less
if you become a Congressmen.

1074
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,900
But if this diary gets out...

1075
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,900
You're going down.

1076
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,200
It's Dopil's?

1077
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,400
Yes, it's his.

1078
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,100
What are you gonna do?

1079
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,200
What do you think?

1080
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,400
Nothing gets done
without me stepping in.

1081
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,500
We should take care of this.

1082
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:13,800
This is impossible.
Taesik, open this for me.

1083
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:15,000
Okay.

1084
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,500
Damn.

1085
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,200
Hi, Wellbeing Garage.

1086
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,700
Taesik, it's me.

1087
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,900
Sunflower Lady is in danger.

1088
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,000
What?

1089
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,500
She blackmailed Mr. Cho.

1090
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,800
- He won't leave her alone.
- What do you mean?

1091
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,300
What happened 10 years ago...

1092
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,500
It was Cho's work.

1093
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,500
He gave Dopil the order.

1094
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,400
What she knows is true.

1095
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,000
I'm telling you
Cho won't let this slide.

1096
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,300
Taesik, be careful.

1097
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,800
I called to warn you.

1098
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,900
You missed class.
Where'd you go?

1099
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,900
How will you go to college
if you play hooky?

1100
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,100
She's been drinking all day.

1101
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,500
Mother, I'm home.

1102
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,100
Hello, son.

1103
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,900
Nobody can touch us now.

1104
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:34,000
I fixed the problem.

1105
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,500
Give me a minute.
Let me finish the song.

1106
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:47,800
<i># Fall, this lonely night</i>

1107
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:53,800
<i># Bugs are crying</i>

1108
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,600
Let me tell you.
Life is a battle.

1109
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,600
Doing your best isn't enough.

1110
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:04,300
The winner sleeps with a beauty.

1111
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,500
And the loser sleeps alone.

1112
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,700
- Understood?
- Yes.

1113
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,700
Let's go, boys.

1114
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,200
One, two, three.

1115
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,500
Let's go!

1116
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,100
Nice serve!

1117
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,400
Far, further!

1118
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,800
Guard! Guard!

1119
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,900
I...

1120
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,800
She got hurt because of me.

1121
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,400
No, don't be saying that.

1122
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,900
If I had sold the restaurant,

1123
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,700
it wouldn't have happened.

1124
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,500
I didn't think
I wanted that much out of life.

1125
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,800
Taesik, she's family.

1126
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,700
Okay?

1127
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,000
Yes.

1128
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:37,300
Nothing's more important
than family in life, okay?

1129
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,500
Yes, mother.

1130
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,100
Okay, we'll sell the place
and leave.

1131
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,300
We'll start all over.

1132
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,400
Take it.

1133
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,800
It's for her surgery.

1134
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,800
It should be enough.

1135
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,000
I saved it for her wedding later.

1136
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,600
But we need it now.

1137
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,800
Byungjin, it's me.

1138
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,600
I need to see Mr. Cho.

1139
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:24,100
Where should I go?

1140
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,000
I need to talk to him.

1141
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,700
- Or...
- It's Oracle.

1142
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,600
- What does it mean?
- A prophet.

1143
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:41,200
Crazy bastards!
A prophet at a night club?

1144
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,400
What can he predict?

1145
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,000
Who knows?

1146
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,500
I hope to see them go down
before I die.

1147
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,500
But I don't see it happening.

1148
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,700
- Let's go eat.
- Okay.

1149
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,900
Want a shot?

1150
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,100
No thanks.

1151
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,700
What'd you wanna see me for?

1152
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,600
My family will leave town.

1153
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,100
Oh, okay.

1154
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,100
Nobody's stopping you.

1155
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,400
Thank you.

1156
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,700
We'll leave in a few days.

1157
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,500
Well...

1158
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:39,500
If you commit a sin,
you get punished for it.

1159
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,400
Give me one of your arms,
and I'll let you go.

1160
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,200
What do you say?

1161
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,100
No?

1162
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,500
Go ahead.

1163
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,000
You'll be able to hold a spoon.

1164
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:40,700
Taesik, your arm is fine.
Don't worry.

1165
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,600
You know what I mean?

1166
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,600
Have a good life somewhere else.

1167
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,800
Consider it as a last gift from me.

1168
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,100
It's okay.

1169
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,200
Everything will be fine.

1170
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:32,700
I'll protect you with my life.

1171
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,200
We'll be happy again.

1172
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,000
My dear son...

1173
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,100
Only if I could see you again.

1174
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,700
If I have to pick the most
difficult time of my life...

1175
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:13,700
It's when we built the restaurant.

1176
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,200
After your father died suddenly...

1177
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,800
We were so poor then.

1178
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:29,200
I wasn't eating well
so I couldn't breastfeed Huiju.

1179
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:37,100
But what kept me going was you.

1180
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:44,100
You were mean to me later.

1181
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:51,400
But I believed
you'd come around one day.

1182
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,300
Looking back...

1183
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:06,600
It was the toughest time
of my life.

1184
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:12,600
But at the same time...

1185
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,400
I couldn't be happier then,
building the restaurant together.

1186
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,800
I wanted to keep the restaurant.

1187
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:29,900
But those bastards are forcing us out.

1188
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,600
I'm sorry.

1189
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,300
Mom's so sorry.

1190
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,300
The living has to keep on living.

1191
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,200
Yes, we'll leave.

1192
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,400
I'll be fine somewhere else.

1193
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:08,800
Yes, we'll leave.

1194
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,700
Mother, it's me.

1195
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,700
Mother!

1196
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,700
Mother, open your eyes.

1197
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,000
Mother?

1198
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,300
Mother! Mother!

1199
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,100
Mom, open your eyes.

1200
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,300
Open your eyes!
Mom!

1201
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,400
Mom...

1202
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,000
Open your eyes!
Mom?

1203
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,600
Mom... Mom...

1204
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,200
Mother...

1205
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:05,800
Mom, open your eyes.
Mom? Mom!

1206
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,700
She was such a good person.

1207
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,400
Being rich isn't everything
in life.

1208
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:39,200
It's about living a healthy life,
respecting others.

1209
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,100
I don't understand
why she did it.

1210
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,000
She was such a nice person.

1211
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,100
She should've listened to us.

1212
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:07,300
She got too greedy.

1213
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,400
Anybody?

1214
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,300
It's me, Taesik.

1215
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,200
Taesik?

1216
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,900
Oh, I said I'd call you brother.

1217
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,400
Brother...

1218
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,100
Sounds weird?

1219
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,700
No.

1220
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,800
Where's mom?

1221
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:10,800
Mom?

1222
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:17,200
She's at the restaurant.
She'll be back soon.

1223
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,600
Brother...

1224
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,500
Do me a favor.

1225
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,200
Hello?

1226
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,200
Hello?

1227
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,800
Everybody, focus.

1228
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:01,500
Let's rehearse again.
Attention. Bow.

1229
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,600
Sir!

1230
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:52,800
Nothing's impossible
if you push it.

1231
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,400
How nice of you
to work together.

1232
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,400
It's all thanks to you.

1233
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:03,800
Get along from now on.

1234
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,100
Run the club well.

1235
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,500
Thank you, sir.
We'll do our best.

1236
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
What's this?

1237
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,000
What?

1238
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,600
Can't you hear it?

1239
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:32,000
Who the fuck is crying?

1240
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:35,400
It's me, fucker.

1241
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:40,100
Oh Taesik.

1242
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,200
You know what?

1243
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:51,200
For 10 years, I regretted
and promised to myself.

1244
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,100
Did you have to do it?

1245
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,200
You shouldn't have.

1246
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:11,300
Did you have to take it all?

1247
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,400
Motherfuckers!

1248
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,100
Are you out of your mind?

1249
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:19,400
Taesik, you're back.

1250
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,600
Welcome.

1251
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,600
What can you do with that hand?

1252
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,200
I heard about that lady.

1253
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,500
And her daughter.

1254
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:38,700
It's so sad.

1255
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,800
I'll make it sadder for you.

1256
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,200
I was looking for it.

1257
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,200
You had it.

1258
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:04,800
Who messed up Huiju's face?

1259
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:10,800
I did, asshole.
Got a problem?

1260
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,300
Byungjin, leave.

1261
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:18,100
Unless you wanna die.

1262
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,000
That moron!

1263
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,600
I'm sorry.

1264
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,900
Thanks for letting me live.

1265
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:57,700
If you commit a sin,
you get punished for it.

1266
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,500
Understood?

1267
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:09,500
Consider it my punishment.

1268
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:14,600
Hey, do something.

1269
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,800
This is quite embarrassing.

1270
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:21,800
Give me a chance.
I'll take care of him.

1271
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:25,700
Yeah? Go ahead.

1272
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:35,400
This is my break
to leave a good impression.

1273
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,000
I can do this.

1274
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,900
He's a joke.

1275
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,700
Should I make it worse?

1276
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,700
Fuck! Put out the fire!

1277
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,800
Get away from me!

1278
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,800
Motherfucker!

1279
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,500
I saw this coming.

1280
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:40,700
I should've dealt
with you myself.

1281
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:45,200
Trash is trash.

1282
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,500
<i>Did you drink?</i>

1283
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,800
<i>No.</i>

1284
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,500
<i>I didn't drink.</i>

1285
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,100
<i>Did you fight?</i>

1286
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,900
<i>No.</i>

1287
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:45,100
<i>I didn't fight.</i>

1288
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:50,000
<i>Then you won't be crying.</i>

1289
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,400
<i>Forever!</i>

1290
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,400
<i>Mom...</i>

1291
01:52:02,700 --> 01:52:04,200
<i>Huiju...</i>

1292
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1293
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,300
Here's the definition
of Laplace transform.

1294
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,500
Either F (s) or L (f) are used
as notation.

1295
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,400
Laplace transform of F (t) is...

1296
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,000
0 to infinity.

1297
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,400
2 and -s (t), f (t), dt.

1298
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:47,000
And this inverse
Laplace transform is F (t).

1299
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:52,000
Next, this is example of
Laplace transform.

1300
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,300
When t is bigger than 0 and
F (t) is 1...

1301
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,800
Laplace transform of this is...

1302
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:04,600
By the definition L (f) is L (1)
and integral 0 to infinity,

1303
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,800
2 and -s (t), dt so,
if you integral calculus

1304
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,400
- 1/s, 1 and -s (t)...

1305
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:17,000
0 to infinity
so the answer is 1/s.

1306
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,300
That's it for today.

1307
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,000
You had a hard time
staying awake.

1308
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:28,400
I'll make sure those who dozed off
will get a F.

1309
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:32,200
Hand in your papers to Huiju.

1310
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:37,700
Everybody's impressed
with your thesis, Huiju.

1311
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:38,900
See you.

1312
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,500
<i>Passing a thesis examination</i>

1313
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,500
Let me ask you something.

1314
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:17,800
What is it?

1315
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:22,100
Were you in love with Taesik?

1316
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:23,800
Love?

1317
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,100
I don't know.

1318
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:29,800
What do you think love is?

1319
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,000
What's love?

1320
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,200
It's simple.

1321
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,400
It's about happy moments
and good memories.

1322
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:46,500
If you remember,
love doesn't change.

1323
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:50,800
It doesn't?
