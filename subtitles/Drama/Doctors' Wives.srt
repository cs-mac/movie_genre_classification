1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,954
You brought these dishes for me.
Why are you eating them?

2
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,060
Just be a good doctor.

3
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,527
That's who you are.

4
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:36,973
The most we can do for our loved
ones is sacrificing ourselves.

5
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,673
However, such sacrifice...

6
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,573
does not beautify humanity.

7
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:49,243
(Episode 19)

8
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,539
Tell me now.

9
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,939
What did President Jin say that I said?

10
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:08,608
What did he tell you? I mean,
you go crazy for surgeries...

11
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,809
I don't like how that sounds.

12
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,539
- Is there a different expression?
- That's the most accurate one.

13
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:17,309
Why did you give up what you love so much?

14
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,339
I won't get my feelings hurt.
Just tell me the truth.

15
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,559
I'm taking a step back in order
to take two steps forward.

16
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,839
I did it to make President
Jin put his guard down.

17
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,789
So how exactly will you
take two steps forward?

18
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,208
I'm looking for President Jin's weaknesses.

19
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,939
I'll attack him as soon as I find
them, so don't worry too much.

20
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:37,046
All I can do is going to work.

21
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,308
"Thank goodness. I can at least do this."

22
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,869
Think positively like this.

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,109
You know what?

24
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,738
You always lecture me at
important moments like this.

25
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,839
I'm a former teacher who is a
doctor and a professor now.

26
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,399
I can't hide that part of me.

27
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,709
You have to tell me when
you find his weakness.

28
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,509
You should go home now. I cannot tell you.

29
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,576
It's better for you not
to find out about it.

30
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,469
That is for me to decide.

31
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,208
- Just tell me.
- I don't know anything.

32
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,289
Do you seriously want to
make me look like an idiot?

33
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,636
I don't know how you felt about
me, but I thought of you...

34
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,357
as my best friend until Hye Jung showed up.

35
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,669
I do know that you were
very understanding of me.

36
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,879
Hye Jung joined your hospital...

37
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,009
because of your dad.

38
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:44,039
- And why is that?
- Have you met her grandmother?

39
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,509
I have. I don't remember her well, though.

40
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,959
She passed away while getting
surgery for her cancer.

41
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,409
Your dad was the operating surgeon,
and it was medical malpractice.

42
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,039
What?

43
00:02:58,509 --> 00:02:59,509
Does that mean...

44
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:03,239
she passed away because my dad
made a mistake during the surgery?

45
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,143
Is that what Hye Jung thinks?

46
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,253
She told me recently that she
found pertinent evidence.

47
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,809
- That's nonsense.
- Do you think that she would've...

48
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,919
kept it to herself for 13
years if it were nonsense?

49
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,069
It's not like Hye Jung is dumb.

50
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,409
You know it too.

51
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:21,139
Her dream was running Grandma's Diner.

52
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:24,339
She wanted to live happily with
her grandma for a long time.

53
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:30,039
I'm sure she's mistaken. There's no
way my dad would do such a thing.

54
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,939
Seo Woo.

55
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,638
Good to see you, Father.

56
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,468
Likewise. Why were you guys
waiting for me at the door?

57
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,406
I'm just here for a cup of tea.

58
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,739
We should greet you at the door, of course.

59
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,009
- What about Mother?
- She's sleeping.

60
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:00,639
- It's citron tea.
- Thanks.

61
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,936
- Where is Seo Woo?
- She's not home yet.

62
00:04:07,937 --> 00:04:09,577
I need to talk to Father about something.

63
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,969
All right, fine.

64
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:20,889
What do you need to talk to me about?

65
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,039
Darn it.

66
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,468
Are you feeling unwell?

67
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,916
No, it's just from stress.

68
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,198
I heard you skipped the annual
medical checkup last year.

69
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,469
- Get it done.
- I will.

70
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,269
What's stressing you out? You can tell me.

71
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:46,838
I want to invest more...

72
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,369
in Sangil Pharmaceuticals'
shares, but I don't have money.

73
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,608
You've already invested a lot.
Why do you want to do more?

74
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:52,609
Don't do it if you can't afford it.

75
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,309
I should become the main shareholder.

76
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:58,509
I'd like to own a stable company
aside from the hospital.

77
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,769
- What about the subsidiary?
- I should give that to Seo Woo.

78
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,289
I heard that a new drug the company
is developing will be a huge hit.

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,043
Then their share price
will certainly go up.

80
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,308
The return will be a few
times the investment.

81
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,609
Then I'll buy the shares for you.

82
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,286
What will we do with the slush fund anyway?
Let's use it.

83
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,509
I honestly cannot live without you.

84
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:22,038
Let's go on a cruise when we start
building the geriatrics centre.

85
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,139
Don't worry. Your stepmother goes
on trips all the time anyway.

86
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,539
I miss your mother.

87
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,609
She was so good to me.

88
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,502
Why are you talking about Mum all
of a sudden? I miss her too.

89
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:38,509
I must pave the road for you
to be able to make her proud.

90
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:42,639
Don't worry about a thing.

91
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,339
- Oh, Doctor. Why are you...
- What brings you here, Ma'am?

92
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,769
I'm her dad.

93
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,009
My goodness. I sincerely apologise.

94
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,212
My granddaughter made a big mistake.

95
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,409
I'm so sorry.

96
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,539
Did you get hurt badly? I'm really sorry.

97
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,549
I thought you left for the day.

98
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:29,609
Why did you come back?

99
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,239
Yeong Gook.

100
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,509
Yes.

101
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:39,069
Do something you shouldn't to me.

102
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:14,709
It'll be okay.

103
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,339
(Gukil Medical Center)

104
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,039
How is the patient doing?

105
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:41,208
Her temperature is normal at 36 degrees.

106
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,409
That's a relief.

107
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,039
Dr Kim asked you to be
at all the conferences.

108
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:47,179
- After we check on the patient.
- Okay.

109
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,939
You're impressive, truly.

110
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,182
Patient Lee Hee Young is a
29-year-old female patient.

111
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,838
She was brought to the ER
after a traffic accident.

112
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,239
She was in a semi-coma
when she was brought in.

113
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:17,668
According to the brain CT scan, she
had an intracranial haemorrhage...

114
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,368
which was around 80cc in
the left parietal lobe.

115
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,082
It was due to an arteriovenous rupture.

116
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,343
We concluded there was almost no
possibility for her to recover,

117
00:08:26,344 --> 00:08:30,275
but did an emergency surgery
because she was 20 weeks pregnant.

118
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,353
How is the baby?

119
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,538
She's growing without any problems so far.

120
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,202
Keep a close eye on the patient.

121
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:37,338
If anything seems wrong, we'll have
to bring the baby out right away.

122
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:39,255
- Keep Gynaecology in the loop.
- Got it.

123
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,839
That's enough for today.

124
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:50,709
I have something to tell all of you.

125
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:55,278
There were several issues within
and outside of Neurosurgery...

126
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,469
for the past few months.

127
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,339
A colleague was sick,

128
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,789
disciplinary action was taken on another...

129
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,509
and people were critical of us...

130
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,430
because of a patient that
became a social issue.

131
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:11,839
We might have to endure this
for a longer amount of time.

132
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,969
However, we only have one another...

133
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:18,869
to bear through this together.

134
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,539
Neurosurgeons deal with the brain.

135
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,779
The brain controls the human body.

136
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:28,909
That means...

137
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,509
The Department of Neurosurgery
controls everything.

138
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,939
(Test Result Summary)

139
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,869
I heard about it from Dr Jung Yoon Do.

140
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,169
You're Dr Yoo's father?

141
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,895
Yes.

142
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:52,109
What are your symptoms?

143
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,409
I'm always tired...

144
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:58,109
and my upper stomach hurts.
I went to a small clinic,

145
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:01,439
but they told me to go here
after doing a blood test.

146
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,779
Your liver index is a bit high.

147
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,278
Let me check your eyes.
Could you open them wide?

148
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,279
Okay.

149
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,279
Do you drink a lot?

150
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,009
Yes, I drank a bit recently.

151
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:16,129
I don't think it was a bit.

152
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,050
There seems to be an
inflammation in your liver.

153
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,119
I'll do an ultrasonic
wave test on your liver.

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,139
Okay.

155
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,508
How do you know Dr Jung?

156
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,129
He's a regular at my diner.

157
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,909
He also did my wife's surgery.

158
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:33,309
Dr Jung must be going the extra mile
because you're Dr Yoo's father.

159
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,669
I'm thankful.

160
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,709
The prosecution just needs the
slush fund transactions, right?

161
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,479
This will end faster than I thought.

162
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,009
Dr Kim.

163
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,609
I'm sorry, but I can't use it now.

164
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:49,069
Why not?

165
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,112
President Jin is holding
Dr Yoo as collateral.

166
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:54,169
Dr Yoo?

167
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,049
I don't believe it. You turned
out to be a total romantic.

168
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,209
Dr Kim.

169
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,389
When I heard that you're going
to the research centre,

170
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,769
I knew there must be some big reason.

171
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,949
But who knew it would be for love?
Should I congratulate you?

172
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,539
Stop making fun of me.

173
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,169
I like seeing you dating someone
and I hope it works out.

174
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:24,739
But Ji Hong, we don't have much time.

175
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,909
Once the geriatrics centre
takes its initial steps,

176
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,839
the hospital would face too much loss.

177
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,969
Whoever takes President Jin's place...

178
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,269
will have to start with a burden of
a great deficit on his shoulders.

179
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,529
That's why I'm thinking about it.

180
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,539
Wait.

181
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,379
Can I talk to you for a minute?

182
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,509
Did you come to work here...

183
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,339
because of my dad?

184
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:12,369
Yes, I did.

185
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,438
Do you think your grandma died
from my dad's medical malpractice?

186
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,068
It's a fact, not an opinion.
I confirmed it.

187
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:20,839
How could you confirm something
that happened 13 years ago?

188
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,312
There can't be any records left.

189
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:24,639
There were records.

190
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,506
Someone still had them.

191
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:30,379
Why would anyone keep it
if it's not even his own?

192
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,469
There was a good enough
reason and I accepted it.

193
00:12:35,609 --> 00:12:38,812
Did you read out the records accurately?
Who helped you with it?

194
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,209
Dr Jung Pa Ran.

195
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:46,269
Things we can't control
happen in the operation room.

196
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:47,819
You know that.

197
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,839
They made a settlement.

198
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:53,009
My dad and the hospital.

199
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,969
I came to ask you something.

200
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:12,468
- What is it?
- Did Dr Yoo come see you...

201
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,799
to ask for help in reading out
an anaesthesiology report?

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,669
Yes, I did and I told her
the surgeon made a mistake.

203
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:22,179
Does Prof. Hong Ji Hong
know about this as well?

204
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,469
He probably does.

205
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,769
He was the one who introduced me to Dr Yoo.

206
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,209
Then does Yoon Do know about it too?

207
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,209
Yes, he does. He likes Dr Yoo.

208
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,969
I've never seen anyone have
such a creative crush.

209
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,269
Thank you for telling me.

210
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,439
Did you become a director...

211
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:57,469
because of Hye Jung?

212
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,209
- Yes.
- To help her?

213
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:05,209
Not just her, but also Prof. Hong.

214
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:09,339
You never cease to surprise me.

215
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,736
You weren't like this before.

216
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,239
You never interfere in
other people's affairs.

217
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:16,209
You don't like fights or politics.

218
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,108
There was no other way for
me to get closer to Dr Yoo.

219
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,739
Is that all that matters?

220
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:23,939
What about me?

221
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,769
You've known me for a long time.

222
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,369
We're close friends.

223
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,609
You've relied on me during hardships.

224
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,109
How could you do this to me?

225
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:37,369
- I'm sorry.
- Then act like you are.

226
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,412
What do you want me to do?

227
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,809
Don't make this hard for my dad.

228
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,269
You're siding with Hye
Jung to bring my dad down.

229
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,639
Don't do it.

230
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,309
Am I asking for too much?

231
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,109
My dad isn't a bad person.

232
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:56,339
Hye Jung is mistaken. You
know that, don't you?

233
00:14:57,109 --> 00:15:00,068
Doctors are supposed to
save people's lives.

234
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,539
There's nothing we can do
when we make a mistake.

235
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,009
None of us can.

236
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:25,909
Dr Yoo is so pretty.

237
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,339
Dr Jung looks pretty good too.

238
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,869
(Thank you for waiting.)

239
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:40,112
- Kang Soo.
- Yes?

240
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,369
The printer ran out of ink.

241
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,638
Could you help me with it? I'm
flowing with ideas right now.

242
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,269
You're writing non-fiction.

243
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,438
You're plagiarising Dr Yoo's life.

244
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:51,009
Come on, Joong Dae.

245
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,468
Could you live a life
I'd want to plagiarise?

246
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:57,009
- How dare you...
- What are you doing?

247
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,709
Joong Dae, did you do a CT scan
for Patient Lee Chung Hyun?

248
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,743
- Yes, I did.
- So you did.

249
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:05,368
You're doing a good job
without any of my nagging.

250
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,539
You're doing better without me.

251
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,969
I'm about to drop to the
floor, covering for you.

252
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,939
Don't drop to the floor. No one
will be able to catch you.

253
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,075
That's just your luck.

254
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,879
Who knew that would happen to Kang Soo?

255
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,839
Joong Dae, I did the CT scan
for Patient Lee Chung Hyun.

256
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:26,238
It's hard to do everything by myself.

257
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:29,708
It was already too much
work when we had Kang Soo.

258
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,509
- Are you whining at me?
- No.

259
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,672
It's okay. I can give him a hand.
You can't hire someone new now.

260
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:37,708
There's too much work for Joong
Dae to take care of alone.

261
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:40,069
Guys, shall I help you?

262
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,249
- It worked!
- It worked!

263
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,085
Go pick up some paper.

264
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,939
Hey, work on the night duty schedule.
I had to take care of it.

265
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,468
I had no idea that knuckling
you on the head a few times...

266
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,133
would make me become your slave.

267
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:52,789
Why do I have to be your slave?

268
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,489
I told you. The boomerang effect.

269
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,026
It taught me that such
effect actually exists.

270
00:16:58,027 --> 00:17:00,639
Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae. You little...

271
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,268
How dare you mock me? I
shall teach you a lesson!

272
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:07,068
If Joong Dae leaves, you and I
need to absorb all of his tasks.

273
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,109
That's right.

274
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:12,743
- I was going to say I like him.
- Were you?

275
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,384
People may not know this, but I like you.

276
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,139
You need some paper, and you
want the schedule. Okay.

277
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,985
- I secretly like you.
- Joong Dae, let's go.

278
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,836
- Podgy Number 1!
- Podgy Number 2!

279
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:23,869
Cross!

280
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,669
- I like you.
- All right.

281
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,609
I don't like you, though.
He's a bit delusional.

282
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,609
(General Surgery, Jeong Pa Ran)

283
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:43,139
- Yes, Doctor.
- I have your father's result.

284
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,939
- Pardon me?
- He came to see me.

285
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,409
I'm calling to give you a heads up
because I thought you'd be worried.

286
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,439
I guess you didn't know.

287
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,948
The ultrasound shows that
you have a fatty liver.

288
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,169
That also caused hepatitis.

289
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:06,809
Is it serious?

290
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,626
No. You can just visit me for
appointments and take medication.

291
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:10,669
I see.

292
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:22,908
Your next appointment has been made.
Please arrive on time.

293
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,816
You can make your payment
on the ground floor.

294
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,819
Will I get my medication today as well?

295
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,312
You can pick it up when
you make your payment.

296
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,339
Okay.

297
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,669
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

298
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:57,839
Why did you summon me?

299
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,638
I can call you anytime, right?

300
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:02,969
Yes, that's right.

301
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,268
I'd like to consult you on something.

302
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,539
What is it?

303
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:07,909
My father was here.

304
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:11,069
- To see you?
- No, as a patient.

305
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,719
I was so worried, thinking that
it might be something serious.

306
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:19,209
It'll be hard to turn away
from him if he's ill.

307
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:25,109
Right. Family relationships are
usually the most difficult ones.

308
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:30,269
You get hurt the most by them yet
feel the most attached to them.

309
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,009
- I don't want to be close to him.
- No one is asking you to do so.

310
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,149
You're putting that pressure on yourself.

311
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:40,169
- You won't tell me to do so?
- I won't.

312
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:43,339
I can't tell you to do something
that I don't do myself.

313
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,109
That makes me feel better.

314
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,539
- How can you be so cool?
- Why are you sweet suddenly?

315
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:54,139
I'm so happy that you're my man.

316
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,839
- Am I your man?
- Yes. You're mine.

317
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,189
It's been a while.

318
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,870
It looks like those beagles have
stopped coming over to your place.

319
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,409
Yes. See you around.

320
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,739
- Gosh, you startled me.
- Did I surprise you?

321
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:41,343
It looked like you were out on a date.
Why are you here?

322
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:43,212
Hey, do you want to have
dinner with me later?

323
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,353
No. I don't like how you're looking at me.

324
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:48,102
- It looks like you pity me.
- That's not what it is.

325
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:50,479
Come over to my place later.
I'll have food ready.

326
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:54,039
- No, thanks.
- Bring a bottle of wine.

327
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,669
I said no.

328
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,139
Why are you ignoring my
opinion altogether...

329
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:00,439
Darn it.

330
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,922
- Where did he go?
- He should be back soon.

331
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:11,442
He just stepped out because
Chairman Jin came by.

332
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,479
All right.

333
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:50,739
I am going to...

334
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,009
kill you.

335
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,869
I'll torture you to death even
if I can't actually kill you.

336
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,859
Did you say Seo Woo is here to see me?

337
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:06,809
Hey, you're here.

338
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:11,969
What's up?

339
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,509
- Hye Jung told me.
- I don't want to hear that name.

340
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:21,469
It was just an accident.
It's not like I intended it.

341
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,489
She should know better as a doctor,
but she's stressing me out.

342
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,192
What did she do to you?

343
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:30,139
I don't want to talk about it.
My head hurts because of it.

344
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,172
Are you feeling sick?

345
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,573
I have a lot of stress because
there's too much on my plate.

346
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:43,069
- You're leaving already?
- I want to look into something.

347
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,599
I kept researching after I
spoke to you the last time.

348
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:54,869
I was looking for a way to make you...

349
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,009
take responsibility legally for
what happened to my grandmother.

350
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,539
- Did you find any?
- There was none.

351
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,509
So I found another way.

352
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:05,369
I am going to...

353
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:07,539
kill you.

354
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,869
(Operating Room)

355
00:23:35,469 --> 00:23:39,009
He's my dad, so I obviously have
to think from his perspective.

356
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,669
Do it, then.

357
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,409
I heard how you threatened him.

358
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:46,539
You said you'd harass him
and torture him to death.

359
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,539
Did he tell you?

360
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,969
No. I found a recording.

361
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,109
Recording?

362
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,409
A recording of the
conversation you two had.

363
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,909
I guess he recorded it.

364
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,906
It's so cruel. How can you say that
when you're a doctor yourself?

365
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:06,269
Has every single one of your
surgeries been successful?

366
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,069
I'm sure some of the patients
you operated on died too.

367
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,209
Any doctor can make a
mistake during a surgery.

368
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,109
But do you know what he said to
me after the surgery going wrong?

369
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:19,709
"I did my best, so I'm
not scared of anything."

370
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:22,869
Then he said that he'll talk to my parents.

371
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,538
You were underage, so he had
to talk to your parents.

372
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,739
He should've expressed
condolences for her death first.

373
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,639
Had he apologised properly...

374
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,969
and showed me that he
respects my grandma's life,

375
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:36,939
I wouldn't have come this far.

376
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,539
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

377
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,289
I wouldn't have misunderstood you
if you had shared it with me.

378
00:24:48,609 --> 00:24:49,969
I wanted to be considerate of you.

379
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,139
Why though?

380
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,339
Your kindness helped me
do well on the math test,

381
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,639
and it inspired me to study hard.

382
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,639
You gave me so much
through that experience.

383
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,369
That's why I kept it from you.

384
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:36,509
You're acting strange. I think
something happened to you.

385
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:37,909
Something happened.

386
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,209
I became the head of the
DBS research centre.

387
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,469
- Will that change anything?
- Do you know this feeling?

388
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,669
You hate it, but you want it badly.

389
00:25:58,539 --> 00:25:59,939
- Welcome.
- Hi.

390
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,606
I made steaks. I grilled the
meat how I like it, though.

391
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,409
I'll just eat whatever you give me.
Here's a bottle of wine.

392
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:09,209
It's an expensive vintage wine.

393
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,509
Cheers.

394
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:25,079
It's so awkward to be wining and
dining with a guy like this.

395
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:30,609
I haven't had a chance to thank you...

396
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:34,368
for what you did after my father's death...

397
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:36,209
and the vote you gave us
at the board meeting.

398
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,169
Do you like me that much?

399
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,139
You know I didn't do it for you.

400
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,409
Do you like Hye Jung that much?

401
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,239
Yes.

402
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,769
Could you like me more?

403
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,509
- Are you okay?
- I almost threw up.

404
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:58,336
Why are you acting like this?

405
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:00,809
It's because I like you.

406
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:04,519
This is an interesting
way to make me give up.

407
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,938
Do you think you'd give
up if I act like this?

408
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:07,169
Yes, it's working.

409
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:10,769
It seems like I stand no chance.

410
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:15,539
Can't you try working
things out with Seo Woo?

411
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:18,909
She's just a friend to me.

412
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,539
I feel like I should be taking care of her.

413
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:25,269
That's why I've decided to stop
putting my nose in your affairs.

414
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,819
When did you put your nose in it?

415
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,539
I could help you...

416
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,639
find President Jin's weakness.

417
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,139
It's okay. I've already found it.

418
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,069
- You did?
- Yes.

419
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:37,039
Why haven't you used it against him?

420
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,669
Cheers.

421
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,669
You can tell me whatever is on your mind.

422
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:52,308
Do you know Prof. Hong went to the
research centre because of me?

423
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,309
Yes, I do.

424
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:55,839
When are you going to marry him?

425
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,879
Please save that old man from his misery.

426
00:27:58,409 --> 00:27:59,409
Dr Kim.

427
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:01,209
I'm not joking.

428
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,769
I want to know what else he's
holding back because of me.

429
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,069
President Jin...

430
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:14,069
called me a stumbling block in Prof.
Hong's life.

431
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:20,039
I respect and trust you.

432
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:22,539
You won't...

433
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,009
make me become a stumbling block to Prof.
Hong, will you?

434
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:35,709
You've put me in a hard spot.

435
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,969
What your grandma wants...

436
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,209
is for you to be happy.

437
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:56,169
She wouldn't want you to give
up your present because of her.

438
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,109
My girl...

439
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,769
(Kang Mal Soon)

440
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:54,039
(Kang Mal Soon)

441
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,809
How are you, Grandma?

442
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,069
I'm not doing very well.

443
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:10,039
As you know, I only go
after one thing at a time.

444
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:15,639
I was obsessed with your death until now.

445
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:19,939
But I'm not happy.

446
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:23,769
I'm not becoming happier.

447
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:27,008
(Kang Mal Soon)

448
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,239
You know Mr Hong, right?

449
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,769
He was the goofy tenant at our house.

450
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,239
Whenever I'm with him,

451
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:39,609
I find myself smiling.

452
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,269
I feel happy.

453
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,809
(Kang Mal Soon)

454
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:53,009
You want me to be happy, right?

455
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:57,409
Is it okay...

456
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,799
if I only think about you
only from time to time?

457
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,509
Have a seat.

458
00:31:19,339 --> 00:31:22,369
I cooked, so we could eat
before going to work together.

459
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,269
Did you come from home?

460
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,069
No, I went to see my grandma.

461
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:29,639
I should go see her too.
Let's go together next time.

462
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,139
That's two fouls. One more, and you're out.

463
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,539
When did I commit a foul?

464
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,469
I met Dr Kim.

465
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:42,769
You look nervous.

466
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:45,709
Yes, I'm scared I'll get in trouble.

467
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,609
You seem to scold me often.

468
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,469
Do whatever you want with that USB.

469
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:56,709
I know President Jin
recorded our conversation.

470
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:58,829
I also know you're
hesitating because of it.

471
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:01,868
I used to think it was fake...

472
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:04,269
if I made a decision but
didn't take action.

473
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:05,869
Now, I think differently.

474
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:08,609
How could I do everything?

475
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,769
Make President Jin sorry for me.

476
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:16,439
You have the strength that I don't.

477
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:20,809
If you lose this opportunity because of me,

478
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,009
I won't ever be able to live with myself.

479
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:27,069
He said he'd sue you for threatening him.

480
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:31,709
Your past will be brought to the surface,

481
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,750
and I don't know what kind
of harm it might do you.

482
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,469
I'll deal with it when I have to.

483
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:38,339
That's how I lived my life so far.

484
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,449
I'll have to ask you to
have that much trust in me.

485
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,309
All right.

486
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,239
This looks good.

487
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,039
The construction for the
geriatrics centre...

488
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,539
which has been our long-term
wish is finally starting.

489
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,319
If you take a look at the
data in front of you,

490
00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:17,269
you'll see that we've decided to
work with Moonjung Construction.

491
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:21,439
We are planning to spend 120 million
dollars in the construction.

492
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,839
It's finally happening.

493
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,639
It's like the weight has been
lifted off of my shoulders.

494
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,068
Did you see how upset Dr Kim was?

495
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,439
I wish Prof. Hong was there.

496
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,343
I didn't see Yoon Do today.

497
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:01,339
He isn't interested in management
but came for fun last time.

498
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,469
What is this?

499
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,009
Who are you?

500
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,508
We're from the Seoul Prosecutor's office.

501
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:20,239
What for?

502
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,539
Chairman Jin Sung Jong?

503
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,539
That's me.

504
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,839
Chairman Jin Sung Jong.

505
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:28,408
You are under arrest...

506
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,379
for embezzlement and malpractice.

507
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:34,399
This is ridiculous.

508
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,069
You have the right to appoint an
attorney and to remain silent.

509
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:41,109
The right to remain silent could
work against you in court.

510
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:43,109
Who is your boss?

511
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,769
Would you like to come with us?

512
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,609
I feel like you'd be related to the crimes.

513
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:51,139
No, he has nothing to do with it.

514
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:52,939
Let's go.

515
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,939
Father! Father!

516
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,339
Father!

517
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:02,582
(Gukil Medical Center)

518
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,168
Chairman Jin of Gukil Medical
Center established an agency...

519
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,938
and embezzled 3 million dollars,

520
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,138
using it for personal stocks...

521
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:14,608
while taking care of the
facilities since 2006.

522
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,708
Chairman Jin also took 2
million as a rebate...

523
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:22,109
in exchange for the operating
rights of subsidiary facilities.

524
00:35:30,509 --> 00:35:31,869
Would you like to get some coffee?

525
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,879
Let's go.

526
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:38,108
- Let's go.
- Chairman Jin has been arrested...

527
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:40,909
for embezzlement and malpractice.
Those involved are being prosecuted.

528
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,308
The prosecution found
out about other crimes,

529
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,438
regarding the supply
contracts of medical goods.

530
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,969
They are planning to
expand the investigation.

531
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,469
This is Ha Gang Yoon, SBC.

532
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:55,409
Hi.

533
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:02,989
The hospital seems to be in disorder.

534
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,095
President Jin won't sit still.

535
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:06,269
I'm ready.

536
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,809
The past isn't as strong as the present.

537
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,399
We can do this.

538
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,809
I'm a bit scared.

539
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,379
You're cute.

540
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:18,443
I didn't expect to hear that.

541
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:21,308
People say that I'm gentle and charismatic.

542
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,950
I would've been scared
if this concerned you.

543
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,509
But I'm okay because it's about me.

544
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:26,969
You're kind of cute.

545
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,708
You never lose, do you?

546
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,809
What do you mean? I always let you win.

547
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:34,389
You let me win?

548
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,206
That's so not true. I won fairly.

549
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,716
You're seriously obsessed with winning.

550
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:43,069
I'm not really obsessed. Don't
jump to your own conclusions.

551
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:49,939
Why?

552
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,539
I want to kiss you.

553
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:13,879
Are you doing all right?

554
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,509
- Are you feeling unwell at all?
- No.

555
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:20,079
Has the prosecution interrogated you yet?

556
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,639
It'll happen soon.

557
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:27,009
- I did everything.
- No!

558
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:30,809
I might get released on
bail due to my old age.

559
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:34,179
One getting locked up is better
than both of us ending up in jail,

560
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:37,068
and I should be the one
between the two of us.

561
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:38,572
Father, please!

562
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:41,982
I won't be able to sleep a wink
with you locked up in prison.

563
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:45,669
What about me, then? I can't
sleep with you here, either!

564
00:37:47,269 --> 00:37:49,515
I must teach that jerk, Hong
Ji Hong, a serious lesson.

565
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,939
He's the one who tipped
off the prosecution!

566
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,969
Where did it go?

567
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:10,769
The attorney is here.

568
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:13,538
Why in the world did they arrest him?

569
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,522
It looks like they were concerned
about him destroying evidence.

570
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,219
They already put in a request for a trial.

571
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,068
Chairman Jin isn't a victim.
He's the defendant of the case.

572
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:22,506
- Can we apply for release on bail?
- We should do it.

573
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:23,808
It'll cost you a lot, though.

574
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,570
Who cares about how much it'll cost?
Get him out as soon as possible!

575
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,209
Whatever it is, just say it. You
probably want to console me.

576
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,079
It's not like anything I say
will make you feel better.

577
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:43,589
You've never gone through
anything like this, right?

578
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,669
I have. Twice.

579
00:38:52,669 --> 00:38:53,739
Thanks.

580
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:00,909
(Dad)

581
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:20,469
Hey.

582
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:27,249
What is that girl, Hye Jung, up to now?

583
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,068
Did you want to see me to ask me that?

584
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:32,009
Hong Ji Hong literally punched us
on our faces. I won't let it slide.

585
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:35,233
When he sees that girl getting all
stressed out because of the media,

586
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:36,509
he will learn his lesson.

587
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:39,538
How exactly will you make
the media bother her?

588
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,519
I hid a recording, but it disappeared.

589
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
I should be able to find it, though.

590
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:45,669
I destroyed it.

591
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:47,739
What?

592
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,319
I took your side when I heard
about her grandmother's death...

593
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,409
because you're my dad.

594
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:56,338
I wanted to avoid it altogether
because I felt like it was my fault.

595
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:58,692
I didn't do anything wrong.
She's overreacting.

596
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:00,689
Her family settled, and
it happened 13 years ago.

597
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,309
Do you think she's normal for
coming here because of it?

598
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,936
She's not normal.

599
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:07,539
If that had happened to you, I would
have killed the doctor right away.

600
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:11,229
Why did you do that? You should've
just apologised for your mistake.

601
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,238
Why did you have to hurt her feelings?

602
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,538
Do you know how many people will
try to make money off of you...

603
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,268
when you apologise for things like that?

604
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:19,039
How have you been living your life?

605
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:23,109
Have you only seen those kinds of people?
What about nice people?

606
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:26,133
Do you think weird people like that
make up the entire population?

607
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,209
Is that how you decide to treat people?

608
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,939
I'm embarrassed of you. You humiliate me.

609
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,509
I'm embarrassed of myself too.
I'm mortified.

610
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:40,538
Don't listen to what people are saying.
This mess will end soon.

611
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,208
Your grandfather will be
released on bail too.

612
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,009
Do you know what Hye
Jung's dream used to be?

613
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:47,479
Making sure her grandmother
could live comfortably.

614
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:51,029
She wanted to run her grandmother's
diner after graduating.

615
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,409
Her only dream was to continue
living with her grandmother.

616
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,169
Why can't you empathise with people?

617
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:02,069
"I did my best, but I'm so sorry
that the result is this."

618
00:41:02,939 --> 00:41:04,769
"I'm truly sorry for your loss."

619
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:08,929
If you had said that, she
wouldn't have come this far.

620
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,068
Patient Song Jin Young is
in the ICU now, right?

621
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:33,682
Do a follow-up CT scan and let
me know when she wakes up.

622
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:34,739
Okay.

623
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:37,169
Hi!

624
00:41:38,769 --> 00:41:40,939
What brings you here, Professor?
Good to see you.

625
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:42,908
Am I not allowed to come here or what?

626
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:46,069
You're allowed, of course. You
must be here to see Dr Yoo.

627
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,768
I am? Who said that?

628
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:50,669
- Gosh, we know everything now.
- What are you talking about?

629
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:52,519
The two of you...

630
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,143
Professor, there's something
I have to tell you.

631
00:41:55,144 --> 00:41:57,109
Really? Let's talk, then.

632
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:03,138
Do they actually think that we don't know?

633
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:07,039
No way. If that's the case,
they're way too slow.

634
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:13,146
People might find out soon.

635
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,933
They already know. Can't you tell
from the looks they give us?

636
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:19,539
Well, Dr Kim knows, which means
everyone must know by now.

637
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:23,139
Don't you think we should pretend
not to know about it, though?

638
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:26,109
- Why?
- To entertain people.

639
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:27,939
Sure, let's do that.

640
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,222
You seem so unworried. Are you going
to stay at the research centre?

641
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:36,469
- That's up to President Jin.
- Tell him you want to come back.

642
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:38,968
Aren't you hungry? I'm quite hungry.

643
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:41,619
I want to eat cold noodles before
I go home. Shall we get it now?

644
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,939
Don't do these things.

645
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:46,609
- What did I do?
- Changing the topic.

646
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,989
You can't make your moves because
of the recording, right?

647
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,819
I guess you won't give up until
you go all the way to the end.

648
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,109
That's right.

649
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:58,239
Yes, I can't because of the recording.

650
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,053
However, we'll get a new president
when Chairman Jin gets dismissed.

651
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:03,414
I'll lay low because he's
probably furious at me right now.

652
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:05,909
You're a coward.

653
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:10,192
Just a second.

654
00:43:10,193 --> 00:43:11,239
(Jin Seo Woo)

655
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,239
Yes.

656
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:15,499
You're on night duty today, right?

657
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,839
I have something to tell you.
Meet me briefly.

658
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:21,269
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I'm with someone now.

659
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:23,939
It's something important.

660
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:44,239
Here.

661
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:47,869
Did your dad tell you to give this to me?

662
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,769
No. I stole it.

663
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:56,969
I've met your grandmother.

664
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:01,539
She came to visit me with juice
when I was hospitalised.

665
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:04,539
It was 100 percent fruit juice.

666
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:09,209
I've never thought of
you as my competition.

667
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,909
I was kind to you...

668
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,509
because you weren't my competition.

669
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,669
The reason doesn't change the
fact that you were kind to me.

670
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:22,469
I didn't want to admit that
you were better than me.

671
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,739
I think that's where my tragedy began.

672
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:31,469
I provoked you.

673
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,069
I didn't know...

674
00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:38,089
because it was before I entered
the system called competition.

675
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:41,339
I'm sorry.

676
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:46,769
I had my chances.

677
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,969
Especially when you came to
see me to get Soon Hee out.

678
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:54,969
I justified my decision and thought
that time would take care of it all,

679
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:59,469
but our situation has worsened.

680
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,809
I think this is my chance now.

681
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:18,809
Seo Woo.

682
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:20,869
I'm sorry.

683
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:24,189
I want to apologise to
you on behalf of my dad.

684
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,509
- Did the talk go well?
- Yes.

685
00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:02,169
I'm so glad that I decided not to
hate Seo Woo for all these years.

686
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:07,269
Hye Jung, marry me.

687
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,539
- Sorry?
- You don't want to?

688
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,369
Well...

689
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:15,509
Don't you think it's a bit much?

690
00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:17,539
What do you mean?

691
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:19,939
Marriage isn't a joke.

692
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:22,349
How can you ask me that so thoughtlessly?

693
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,638
It wasn't thoughtless at all. I've
been thinking about it for a while.

694
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:29,269
Still, this is wrong. There was
nothing romantic about it.

695
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,239
I thought you hated those things.

696
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:34,212
Why would I hate it?

697
00:46:34,213 --> 00:46:37,139
That's right. Why did I think you hated it?

698
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,439
I don't.

699
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,769
Should I do it again?

700
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:41,369
Yes.

701
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:43,839
Don't you have something to say to me?

702
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:51,068
Fine, it's not because I
want to hear you say it.

703
00:46:51,069 --> 00:46:52,369
I already know how you feel.

704
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:56,209
But you should learn how
to express yourself.

705
00:46:58,539 --> 00:46:59,639
I'm not going to say it.

706
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:01,868
Why not?

707
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,736
It doesn't seem right today.

708
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,282
I want the lights to be darker.

709
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:08,009
You're funny.

710
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:15,949
I'm happy.

711
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,809
You surprise me when I least expect it.

712
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:22,839
I'm holding back because we're at work.

713
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,309
Good night.

714
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:46,439
President Jin, Prof. Hong
would like to see you.

715
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:58,943
I liked you, Prof. Hong.

716
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:01,069
I had no idea you'd stab me in the back.

717
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:03,253
I'd like to come back.

718
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:06,909
You seem to think you
have the upper hand now,

719
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:08,419
but don't flatter yourself.

720
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,580
I have the recording of your
conversation with Dr Yoo.

721
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:13,069
I have no reason to do as you say.

722
00:48:13,439 --> 00:48:16,269
However, I'll show respect since
you're still the president.

723
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:20,779
Should I come back after you step down?

724
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,992
Then you'll never come back.

725
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:25,509
Nothing must have gone your way recently.

726
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,009
I hope this goes the way you want it to.

727
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:41,409
Dr Yoo is waiting for you.

728
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:52,309
I just met Prof. Hong.

729
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:55,609
Are you working as a
team to get back at me?

730
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:58,769
I'll quit now.

731
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,369
I take back all the curses I cast on you.

732
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:04,239
What are you doing?

733
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:06,639
It was a hard decision to make.

734
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:10,009
I'm going to live my life free from you.

735
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:14,769
I'm here to end what I've started.

736
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:17,119
Do you want me to thank you?

737
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,969
No, please don't.

738
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:20,909
You don't have to say a thing.

739
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:24,269
I'm just here to get closure.

740
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:28,639
I've learned a lot from you.

741
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:44,709
Who does she think she is?

742
00:49:50,439 --> 00:49:54,169
Chairman is being released on
bail and you should go see him.

743
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:56,309
All right. Let's go.

744
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,839
What are you doing here? Are
you looking for Hye Jung?

745
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:10,009
I'm here to see you. Let's go eat.

746
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:11,739
No.

747
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,168
You always skip meals when
you're feeling down. Get up.

748
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:18,012
If you're just repaying
me for being nice to you,

749
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,308
you don't have to.

750
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,309
Do you think I'm here to repay you?

751
00:50:21,939 --> 00:50:23,639
I'm only doing it because I want to.

752
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:25,869
Seo Woo.

753
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:29,809
- Hi.
- Hi.

754
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:35,026
I'm here to get lunch with Seo Woo.

755
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:36,069
Okay, let's go.

756
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:38,839
Hey!

757
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,268
Why did you turn me down
when I asked you to lunch?

758
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:44,069
I can choose whom I want to
have lunch with, can't I?

759
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:45,869
Yes, you can.

760
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,709
Go and have lunch with Yeong Gook.

761
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:50,138
But you're mean.

762
00:50:50,139 --> 00:50:52,938
This is nothing compared
to what you did to me.

763
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:55,069
I'm just saying.

764
00:50:56,739 --> 00:50:58,009
I feel relieved now.

765
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:00,639
Go and buy her a nice lunch.

766
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:03,639
I'll even let you get something
expensive and reimburse you.

767
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:10,869
He's trying to look cool.

768
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,169
He isn't trying. He is cool.

769
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:16,709
It's okay to like him. You
can't stop your feelings.

770
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:18,639
It's not like that.

771
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:20,969
It's because I feel upset,

772
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:23,369
thinking about what an idiot I was.

773
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:26,369
Idiot?

774
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:31,539
(Mum)

775
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,669
I haven't seen you for a while, Seo Woo.

776
00:51:33,869 --> 00:51:36,136
Yes, Grandpa. It was
hard for you, wasn't it?

777
00:51:36,137 --> 00:51:37,882
I'm fine. Let's eat.

778
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:39,539
Father, have some of this.

779
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:45,416
What is wrong with you?

780
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:47,269
I told you to get a medical checkup.

781
00:51:48,169 --> 00:51:51,219
It's because of stress. Why are
you treating me like a patient?

782
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,809
You haven't gotten your
medical checkup yet?

783
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,509
I'll get it since you're back.

784
00:51:57,009 --> 00:51:59,869
Seo Woo, make an appointment for your dad.

785
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:01,922
Okay.

786
00:52:01,923 --> 00:52:03,439
The war begins now.

787
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,039
You have to be healthy for it.

788
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:06,869
Okay.

789
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,539
- Let's eat, Seo Woo.
- Okay.

790
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:12,709
- Eat up, Father.
- I will. Thanks.

791
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,669
Dr Yoo.

792
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,169
Isn't Prof. Hong coming back?

793
00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:28,669
There is a process, so the
President has to approve.

794
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,539
Your father is coming in today.

795
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:35,639
Father?

796
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,309
Your father has an appointment
with Uncle Pa Ran.

797
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:40,309
I was at the diner two days ago.

798
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:44,039
The food is delicious. I heard
it's your grandma's recipe.

799
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,439
Yes.

800
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,409
Dr Jin.

801
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:56,592
Did you give Kim Jin Kyung pills
to take and is she ambulating?

802
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:58,739
Yes, I started wheelchair
ambulation yesterday.

803
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:00,839
I'll have to take a look.

804
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:02,339
Okay.

805
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:08,969
Don't feel intimidated because of
what happened with your father.

806
00:53:09,539 --> 00:53:11,406
I chose you as a fellow
for our department...

807
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:13,169
because you were a good fit for the job.

808
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:15,909
Thank you.

809
00:53:18,939 --> 00:53:20,039
(Dad)

810
00:53:20,669 --> 00:53:21,709
Take it.

811
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:23,109
Okay.

812
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:30,109
Hello.

813
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:38,695
This is Kim Tae Ho speaking.

814
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:41,009
Dr Kim, this is Lee from the test centre.

815
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:44,739
I'm calling because of President
Jin's checkup results.

816
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:46,439
What is it?

817
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:10,039
Hi.

818
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:12,469
Take a look at this.

819
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:18,416
There are tumours in number three and four.

820
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:20,909
It must be either an ependymoma
or a astrocytoma tumour.

821
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:22,309
This is serious.

822
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:25,509
There must have been symptom. Who is it?

823
00:54:27,169 --> 00:54:28,339
President Jin Myung Hoon.

824
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,139
It'll be a difficult surgery.

825
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:33,969
I don't think the result
would be good, either.

826
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:36,969
I'm quite a good surgeon,

827
00:54:38,209 --> 00:54:40,269
but this is hard even for me.

828
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:41,769
I'm sure it is.

829
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:46,269
But you're the only one that
can handle the operation.

830
00:55:04,939 --> 00:55:05,939
(Mum)

831
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:11,409
- Yes, Seo Woo.
- Mum.

832
00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:13,609
I have Dad's results.

833
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:15,339
It isn't bad, is it?

834
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:17,909
He has a tumour.

835
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,439
Long time no see.

836
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:33,769
How are you feeling?

837
00:55:34,169 --> 00:55:35,239
I'm fine.

838
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,369
Do you visit Doo Sik often?

839
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:41,469
I go at least once a month.

840
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,509
I see.

841
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,869
I should go see him too.

842
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,139
He was my lifelong friend.

843
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:50,319
That's why I feel sad
about how he passed away.

844
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,839
Could you...

845
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:59,369
operate on Myung Hoon?

846
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:02,675
I'm currently at the research centre.

847
00:56:02,676 --> 00:56:04,539
You can come back. That won't be a problem.

848
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,585
President Jin won't want
me to do the surgery.

849
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:10,836
Leave that up to me.

850
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:14,869
Both the surgeon and the
patient need to be up for it.

851
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,409
He is hostile toward me right now.

852
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:21,969
He won't be able to fully trust me,

853
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:24,769
which means the possibility
to succeed will drop.

854
00:56:26,269 --> 00:56:28,909
Also, this is a highly challenging surgery.

855
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:31,809
The success rate of the surgery
itself is already low.

856
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:35,409
I'd still like to ask you to do it.

857
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:38,709
The surgeon matters way
more than the patient.

858
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:21,836
Did you schedule the surgery...

859
00:57:21,837 --> 00:57:23,357
for Kim Soo Ryeon's cavernous angioma?

860
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:25,439
No, not yet. Why?

861
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,039
I was thinking of asking Mr Hong
to do it since it's complicated.

862
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:33,039
Dr Kim is a good surgeon too.

863
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:37,589
Do you think Mr Hong isn't as
good because he's taking a break?

864
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:39,539
No, I bet not.

865
00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:43,469
He spends most of his time
watching surgery videos.

866
00:57:43,909 --> 00:57:45,769
His hands are swift and delicate.

867
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:53,109
How did you feel when you found
out your grandma had cancer?

868
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,139
I found out about it at the
visiting room in jail.

869
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,469
The sky came crashing down on me.

870
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:05,639
My grandma was my haven.

871
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:08,869
I couldn't stop crying.

872
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:16,039
I hated that I couldn't do anything.

873
00:58:17,669 --> 00:58:20,839
I wondered if my grandma would
be fine if I were nicer.

874
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:29,539
What's wrong?

875
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,909
My dad was always nice to me.

876
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:38,809
I made a lot of memories
with him when young.

877
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:42,609
Did something happen?

878
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,439
We're not on the best
of terms at the moment,

879
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:49,189
but it's because he had high expectations.

880
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:56,516
I hated him, didn't listen to him...

881
00:58:56,517 --> 00:58:57,869
and didn't even go home recently.

882
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,509
(Neurosurgery, Kang Kyung Joon)

883
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:11,109
- What is it?
- A male patient in ER.

884
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,319
I think he went to sleep
after taking sleeping pills.

885
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,369
What are you doing?

886
00:59:15,339 --> 00:59:17,789
Why are you notifying me of a
patient that took sleeping pills?

887
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,449
It's President Jin Myung Hoon.

888
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,469
His wife says he found a
tumour after a recent checkup.

889
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:35,939
- I'm on my way. Call Prof. Hong.
- Okay.

890
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:50,253
Are you okay?

891
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:53,039
Why did you bring me to the ER?
I was just sleeping!

892
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:56,839
Are you okay?

893
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,539
I'm fine, but your mum is embarrassing me.

894
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:04,619
You should've checked into the
hospital when I told you to.

895
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,209
This wouldn't have happened
if you checked in right away.

896
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:11,539
- Let me check you.
- No, it's fine. Let's do it later.

897
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:18,769
Mr Hong.

898
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:21,169
Hi.

899
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:34,909
You have to wait until the
final moment in life...

900
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:38,139
to see what life is trying to teach you.

901
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:41,539
You have to wait until the very end.

902
01:01:03,169 --> 01:01:04,472
(Doctors)

903
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:06,309
I want to make a family.

904
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:09,316
I wish you a long and happy life.

905
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,402
How do you feel about Seo Woo?

906
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:13,719
Be nice if you want this to work.

907
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,822
You're always first.

908
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:16,953
- You don't like my dad.
- He's a patient.

909
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:18,939
I don't want to die, Father.

910
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:22,138
Will you let Prof. Hong operate on you?

911
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,439
There is a problem. Dr Yoo
will be assisting me.

912
01:01:27,969 --> 01:01:29,236
(Doctors)

913
01:01:29,237 --> 01:01:30,957
Would you like to have ramyeon at my place?

914
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:32,609
That's provocative.

915
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:34,839
Move that toy.

916
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:36,539
(I'm tough, aren't I?)

917
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:38,969
This is too funny.

918
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:41,509
Why are you apologising?

919
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:43,309
What was the next line?

920
01:01:46,109 --> 01:01:47,139
What?

921
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:55,608
(A walk to Paris)

922
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:56,609
This is hilarious.
