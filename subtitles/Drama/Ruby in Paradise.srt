1
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,912
I'd love to hire you, honey. But you've
come out of step with the season.

2
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,593
We just cut 3 girls.

3
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,751
The last one goes
back to school tomorrow.

4
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,070
- Tried anyplace else?
- Yes'm. They's all half shut-down,

5
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,958
or they're not hirin'.

6
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,232
Well, like I say,
your timing is way off.

7
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,519
It's now or never.

8
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,918
Mrs. Chambers,
I've done retail before

9
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,638
and I work real cheap.

10
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,149
What is your name?

11
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,714
Gissing.

12
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,028
Ruby Lee Gissing.

13
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,472
Ricky is slime.

14
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,915
He'll come onto you sooner or later.

15
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,436
He came after me, once.
And he ain't even a liberal.

16
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,216
You know, even Mrs. Chambers
knows her son is a true bastard,

17
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,751
but, see, admittin' it would be a
confession of her own, now wouldn't it?

18
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,556
All bosses are scumbags.

19
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,758
Is that why you left... wherever?

20
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,909
Manning.

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,149
Tennessee.

22
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,638
My Mom passed and things
kinda went bad all-around.

23
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,873
There's more to life than workin'

24
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,077
at Uncle Jack's store
and takin' crap from men.

25
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,878
You are a dreamer, ain't you?

26
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,237
Right here, moving up
in the world, and all?

27
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,916
I got out of Manning without
getting pregnant or beat up.

28
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,432
That's sayin' somethin'.

29
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,799
Well. Speak of the devil.

30
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,273
Ain't he a mess.

31
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,597
Works his mama's books upstairs
and God-knows-what on the side.

32
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,796
- Must be a drug dealer.
- Hardly.

33
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,355
Real estate, stocks,
that kinda stuff.

34
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,399
He's one can make money
when all the news is bad.

35
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,996
- It's a good trick.
- Yeah, for him, maybe.

36
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,354
I was here once when
I was 10 years old.

37
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,954
Only vacation I can remember.

38
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,192
Yeah. Summer's fine.

39
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,832
On the other hand, this
time of year's kinda bleak.

40
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,116
Seems fine to me.

41
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,270
If you like ghosts, maybe.

42
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,353
It'll be like this
pretty much 'til Spring Break.

43
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,799
This year they're expecting
thousands, hundreds of thousands.

44
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,352
Sounds impossible.

45
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,750
Well, just the same,
that's what they're sayin'.

46
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,839
You know, most of the locals try to
stay clear, but sometimes it's fun.

47
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,710
The clubs have great music and
everybody just goes a little bit crazy.

48
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,072
Last spring, Billy, my boyfriend,
he just about got himself killed.

49
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,069
What?

50
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,596
Well, he didn't get hurt, I mean,
we were leaving this club, see?

51
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,879
When these four rednecks pull up
and start shouting they don't
want us niggers on their beach.

52
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,875
And they were drunk, you know,
wild and up on us before we knew it.

53
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,231
So club security,
they got there in a flash.

54
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,552
It was a good thing, too, 'cause see,
Billy was, he was kickin' behind.

55
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,873
And the club, they gave us some
passes and a round of drinks,

56
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,191
and I got a story to tell.

57
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,789
And Billy?

58
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,278
Billy goes to school in Atlanta, and...

59
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,878
We're supposed to get married,
and all that good stuff.

60
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,559
Knock on wood.

61
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,550
- Where's that club at?
- Just up a ways.

62
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,432
My God.

63
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,151
Tomorrow, World Geo and Accounting 201.

64
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,393
Yeah.

65
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,354
We agreed that you weren't gonna
make these kind of deals without
telling me about it first!

66
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,433
- I tried, but I had to act,
and I couldn't find you!
- And out of my account?

67
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,068
I don't like being told
that I can't write a check.

68
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,030
Selling short and all the rest of this
stock market crap makes no sense, Ricky.

69
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,636
You're betting on losing money; why don't
you just throw it away at the dog track?

70
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,395
I only made 4 Grand in 3 days!
What'd the store net last week?

71
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,074
This store has been very, very good to you.

72
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,515
If you spent half the time here
that you do on your deals,

73
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,478
- it could be even better.
- How many times do we
have to go through this?!

74
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,108
Yes, this store has been great to me.
No, I will not come in,

75
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,918
because there's no
future in retailing!

76
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,277
- I don't see us hurting.
- Look, I want my own deals.

77
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,715
You know, one day, one of your
hunches is gonna backfire.

78
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,556
- I've gotta be able to trust you, Ricky.
- I'm not going anywhere, Mother!

79
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,678
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
bite the hand that so generously fed me.

80
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,833
- You don't have to get nasty about it.
- I don't have to get anything about it!

81
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,155
I'm late.

82
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,115
You and Rochelle get all those
T-shirts marked down?

83
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,995
Yes, Mrs. Chambers,
they're all priced on the shelf.

84
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,797
Well, next time, make more noise
when you come in.

85
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,556
I'm gonna be away for
a week starting Monday.

86
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,309
Ricky will be in to open up
and cover the upstairs.

87
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,270
There's one rule I have
for all my employees:

88
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,110
They don't date my son.
You understand that?

89
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,589
Yes'm.

90
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,674
It's so great being out of high school.

91
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,915
When I saw all the other kids
going back last month,

92
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,150
I felt like I was out of prison.

93
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,633
It's amazing how much you grow
in a couple of months.

94
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,796
Drive wild, Jimmy!

95
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,197
Jimmy's an artist.

96
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,475
Does airbrush. Shirts and stuff.

97
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,192
It's a glory to watch.

98
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,874
He's gonna teach me so that
I can do it next summer.

99
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,992
- Did you know Jimmy in school?
- I knew Ed.

100
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,958
It's his night to cook,
but I always help.

101
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,195
We all get along just fine, you know?

102
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,591
We're very liberated.

103
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,114
That's a neat old rocker.

104
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,675
Thanks.
It was my Granny's.

105
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,477
- You knew your Granny?
- Both of 'em. Grand-daddys, too.

106
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:10,967
Wow.

107
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,920
I barely knew my Ma.

108
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,913
<i>Where the hell you been?</i>

109
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,634
<i>- Did you run out of gas?
- No, not this time. Come on.</i>

110
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,993
<i>Debrah Ann?</i>

111
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,518
<i>Guess what I got?</i>

112
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,831
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing fancy here.</font>

113
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,514
<font color="#ffff00">Just try to put down
my thinking over time.</font>

114
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,630
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe figure out the why's of
running off, of coming here.</font>

115
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,236
<font color="#ffff00">"Back home".
Seems strange to say that.</font>

116
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,274
<font color="#ffff00">"Back home".
Seems strange to write that.</font>

117
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,158
<font color="#ffff00">It was "Do this, do that."</font>

118
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,078
<font color="#ffff00">Now it's up to me,
to what I want to be.</font>

119
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,473
<font color="#ffff00">I got some idea about inside,</font>

120
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,589
<font color="#ffff00">feelings and stuff.</font>

121
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,031
<font color="#ffff00">But about the outside,</font>

122
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,756
<font color="#ffff00">the acts and looks of things,</font>

123
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,192

124
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,876
<font color="#ffff00">I am not so clear.</font>

125
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,638
<font color="#ffff00">Wonder if I'll ever feel
just what I am.</font>

126
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,749
No...

127
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,270
No, you're right, you're right,
it may never be the same.

128
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,959
<i>Those little bastards love nothing more
than to make trouble for business.</i>

129
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,794
<i>Uh-huh. Leeches is what
they are, worthless.</i>

130
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,718
<i>No! No, no.
It shouldn't affect the deal.</i>

131
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,280
Thirty dollars and
seventy-three cents, please.

132
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,238
<i>No. Not at this time, at least.</i>

133
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,996
Hey, I'll keep you informed, okay?

134
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,272
Here you go. Your receipt.
<i>Listen, JB, if I'm gonna meet
Justine in a half-hour, I gotta go.</i>

135
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,359
<i>JB...</i>

136
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,029
<i>Five bucks says I take you by 3.</i>

137
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:00,674
<i>Oh. Okay, buddy. You're on.</i>

138
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,115
- See you later.
- Are you leaving?

139
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,517
- Huh. It's dead.
- But I--

140
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,956
- The store needs two people.
- No, no you don't.

141
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,514
Trust me.

142
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
- So how about tonight?
- Excuse me?

143
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,549
Dinner, dancing?

144
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,954
This is a resort town you moved to.
You need to resort.

145
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,709
What do you say, Ruby?

146
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,037
- For one thing, I say you're about
as appealing as day-old roadkill.
- Roadkill?

147
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,034
And for another, your mama says that
the help stays clear of the boss' son.

148
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,591
My mama tries to protect me
from opportunists, but uh...

149
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,070
I can take care of myself.

150
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,788
Can you?

151
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,355
Come on, we might as well
get this out of the way.

152
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,628
Who knows?

153
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,955
I dare you.

154
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,468
- 8:00, where do you live?
- I'll meet you here.

155
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,033
Okay.

156
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,829
<font color="#ffff00">So far, fun has been nothing but work.</font>

157
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,669
<font color="#ffff00">Ricky was right:
get it over with.</font>

158
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,519
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

159
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,548
Here.

160
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,995
It's for those lonely nights
when we can't be together.

161
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,397
I really enjoyed our evening.

162
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,398
We'll do it again sometime.

163
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,471
I'll get the cash drawer.

164
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,836
Another day, another dollar.
I hope.

165
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,479
Do something with that towel display
when you get a chance.

166
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,356
And the sidewalk needs sweeping.

167
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,236
Glad you could come. Had to know how
you were doing with Freddy Krueger?

168
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,797
- Who?
- Slick Rick, the hunk in the trunk?

169
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,436
Alright, I guess.
Mrs. Chambers has been on vacation.

170
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,592
So you've been alone with the masher?
He come onto you yet?

171
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,117
I keep him at arm's length.

172
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,438
Besides, half the time
he's not even there.

173
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,076
That's good, see, cause he's the kind
you give an inch and he owns your butt.

174
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,437
He could care less about the store.

175
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,715
How's school?

176
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,475
Mmm. I'm on what they call
a pre-business track.

177
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,552
Just junk, mostly, buying and
selling, like Mrs. Chambers.

178
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,228
Mama wanted me to be a teacher,
but I said forget that no-money crap.

179
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,109
A blue volvo and job security
will make me a happy camper.

180
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,710
My worst nightmare is
I turn into another Ricky.

181
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,677
Oh, well.  Tchk.
As one of my professors says,

182
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,718
"Necessity has always been
our easiest excuse."

183
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,548
What would you teach?
I mean, children.

184
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,638
How to survive.

185
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,832
With your soul intact.

186
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,673
Yeah. I guess that's it.

187
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,516
<font color="#ffff00">Today, lunch with Rochelle.</font>

188
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,437
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know what I'm doing here.</font>

189
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,712
<font color="#ffff00">Call it an experiment.</font>

190
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,112
<font color="#ffff00">Folks do this crap and a whole
lot worse without battin' an eye.</font>

191
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,919
<font color="#ffff00">After all,</font>

192
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,239
<font color="#ffff00">why slave your life out
when you can just take?</font>

193
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,031
<font color="#ffff00">Are there any real reasons
for livin' right, anyway?</font>

194
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,310
<font color="#ffff00">Mama always thought so, and they
held to her like a moth to light.</font>

195
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,669
<font color="#ffff00">With the hopes of earning
everlasting peace and glory.</font>

196
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,114
<font color="#ffff00">"This life and the next"
she used to say.</font>

197
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,430
<font color="#ffff00">It was all a bloody mean trick.
I don't want none of it.</font>

198
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,712
<font color="#ffff00">Get away from Ricky.</font>

199
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,668
Ruby? Come on back here a sec, would you?

200
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,588
- Welcome back, Mrs. Chambers.
- Well, thank you, Ruby.

201
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,993
- How's everything been?
- Fine. Real nice.

202
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,637
Yeah, the store looks good.

203
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,871
You know, usually I'm afraid
to come back after a trip,

204
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,678
but you did a good job.

205
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,197
I'll ask you to do the
cash drawer, if you don't mind.

206
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,119
Surprise!

207
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,399
How about tonight, we could
meet at the Driftwood?

208
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,348
- I don't think so, Ricky.
- Last time was wonderful.

209
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,954
It was fantastic, I don't
wanna lose that momentum.

210
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,915
It was real nice, Ricky,

211
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,436
- but your Mom's back, and
I just think it's too risky.
- Don't worry about that.

212
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,028
And I didn't come all this way
to be your chippy.

213
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,318
Ricky? Ricky! It's for you.

214
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,072
There in a second, Ma.

215
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,075
I'll give you a few days,
and we'll work it out.

216
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,311
It was fantastic.
Fantastic.

217
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,992
<i>That's right, Tom. Now might be a good time
to cover your plants and bring in the cat</i>

218
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,357
<i>because we're expecting the first
severely cold weather of the season.</i>

219
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,478
<i>As you can see, there is quite
an extensive Canadian front</i>

220
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,359
<i>draping into the Southeast this hour.</i>

221
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,354
<i>Behind it, some parts of the
Tennessee Valley are already reporting</i>

222
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,275
<i>record low temperatures, they're experiencing
blizzard conditions in some areas.</i>

223
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,351
<i>Here in Northwest Florida, we'll be
feeling the effects of that cold front</i>

224
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,158
<i>by early tomorrow morning.</i>

225
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,675
<i>There's also a small craft
advisory in effect tonight.</i>

226
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,629
<i>If you have to be out on the gulf,
do exercise extreme caution.</i>

227
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,951
<i>We'll have a look at current conditions
and the extended forecast</i>

228
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,951
<i>right after this message.</i>

229
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,030
"Do exercise extreme caution."

230
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,675
"We'll have a look at current
conditions and the extended forecast

231
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,717
right after this message."

232
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,953
<font color="#ffff00">It's snowing back home.</font>

233
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,278
<font color="#ffff00">They don't need snow here.</font>

234
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,672
<font color="#ffff00">Here, you could get washed out to sea,
and nobody'd ever even know where to look.</font>

235
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,516
- How's the jade?
- Excuse me?

236
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,513
You came in here a while back,
bought a little jade plant.

237
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,998
Part of a set of cuttings I did myself.

238
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,796
Fine. Plant's fine.
That's why I'm back.

239
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,319
Right.

240
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,954
You know, uh...

241
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,309
Most of the nurseries around here,
they-they buy their stuff,

242
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,153
but we grow almost
everything ourselves.

243
00:37:59,213 --> 00:37:59,998
Huh.

244
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,513
Now in, uh, California, jade there

245
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,638
grows as big as garbage cans. Bigger.

246
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,079
But out here, outside, it wouldn't
make it to Thanksgiving.

247
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,919
- Thanks, I'll remember that.
- But now, uh,

248
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,634
you need to know about
your new companion here.

249
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,758
I get off in 10 minutes. 5.

250
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,878
I'm a good guy.
You've seen where I work...

251
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,555
Okay, you tell me where you work and
I'll come by and visit you there.

252
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,589
Chambers' Beach Emporium,
but I'm not allowed to have visitors.

253
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,228
Is that a fact?
That's too bad.

254
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,996
Well, I was just thinking, you know,
everybody's gotta eat sometime.

255
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,116
Would you promise not to say
another word about plants?

256
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,634
What's a plant?

257
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,836
They'd come from all around
but I was old enough to figure out

258
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,316
she had something special going on.

259
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,357
I'd spend all day in the kitchen.

260
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,630
I didn't know people from
Tennessee liked oysters.

261
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,113
Everyone I know.

262
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,349
Thank you.

263
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,150
It's so funny to me. My aunts didn't
care about how great she cooked,

264
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,435
they never tried to learn.

265
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,675
<font color="#ffff00">I met a new guy, Mike McCaslin.
He can talk your ear off about anything.</font>

266
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,916
<font color="#ffff00">But he's a good listener, too.</font>

267
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,957
<font color="#ffff00">I guess I've been needin' that.</font>

268
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,715
<font color="#ffff00">We've seen each other a few times now.</font>

269
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,036
<font color="#ffff00">His great-great-granddaddy
helped settle Panama City.</font>

270
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,798
<font color="#ffff00">and Mike says he knows
everything about this place.</font>

271
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,075
<font color="#ffff00">Like how the Indians lived,</font>

272
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,989
<font color="#ffff00">and where the Spanish first landed.</font>

273
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,876
<font color="#ffff00">And how things started going wrong
almost from the start.</font>

274
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,112
<font color="#ffff00">Mike was real involved once, in
trying to make things better.</font>

275
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,316
<font color="#ffff00">But now he says
he sees there's no point.</font>

276
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,673
My granddaddy and I, we used to
fish off this bridge here.

277
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,879
Ain't nobody gonna be fishing
off this bridge.

278
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,559
Always seems like people have to
tear something down to make
themselves feel alive.

279
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,836
Then we run around scared to death of
whatever's gonna take us out in turn.

280
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,270
Like cockroaches or big-mouth bass.

281
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,673
Right.

282
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,153
Anyway, this whole place'll be
under water in 100 years or so

283
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,117
that oughta slow us down some.

284
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,680
Why wait?
Why not just end it all now?

285
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,513
It's pretty, isn't it?

286
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,079
It's kinda dirty.

287
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,917
You know what these are for?

288
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,993
Neither do I.

289
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,153
<font color="#ffff00">Mike can get morose,
that is no lie.</font>

290
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,352
<font color="#ffff00">But most often he just
seems glad to be here.</font>

291
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,071
<font color="#ffff00">Like a tree, he says.</font>

292
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,798
<font color="#ffff00">That's his job.</font>

293
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,390
<font color="#ffff00">That and keeping the record straight.</font>

294
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,750
Looks like you live next to a junkyard.

295
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,754
That's Jimmy, Ed, and Debrah Ann.
They're alright.

296
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,633
You want to come in?

297
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,590
Next time.
I'll fix you something.

298
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,551
<font color="#ffff00">It's been a long time since
one kiss made my lips hum.</font>

299
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,192
<font color="#ffff00">I can still feel it.</font>

300
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,236
<font color="#ffff00">Must be all that bike riding.</font>

301
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,636
<font color="#ffff00">Gotta watch it with Mike.</font>

302
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,558
Be careful, now.

303
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,390
There. Beautiful!

304
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,791
- So what's this all about?
- Our second season. You'll see.

305
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,798
Y'all got enough stuff now?

306
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,230
<font color="#ffff00">So I like selling stuff, okay?
Is that good?</font>

307
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,237
<font color="#ffff00">Five days of one thing for two
of something else.  Fair enough.</font>

308
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,960
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, the weeks are
moving faster now.</font>

309
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,315
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes I see Rochelle.</font>

310
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,995
...some course you could take.
Finance, marketing, management ...

311
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,716
so you can run the business
one day. Or general education...

312
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,918
<font color="#ffff00">She says I should set my sights
higher, go back to school.</font>

313
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,593
<i>It's the only way to get ahead.</i>

314
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,228
<font color="#ffff00">But Mike doesn't see much point to it.</font>

315
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,755
You just need a guide,
to aim you in the right direction.

316
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,236
- And here you are.
- At your service.

317
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,314
<font color="#ffff00">Mike says there's a whole
new way to see the world.</font>

318
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,995
<font color="#ffff00">Low-impact living, he calls it.</font>

319
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,596
<font color="#ffff00">Getting unburdened,
giving nature a chance.</font>

320
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,879
<font color="#ffff00">Sounds fine.</font>

321
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,832
<font color="#ffff00">What I can make of it.</font>

322
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,989
<font color="#ffff00">And yes, we've gotten it on.
All tender and romantic.</font>

323
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,712
<font color="#ffff00">I'd been here almost three months
and hadn't gone swimming.</font>

324
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,311
<font color="#ffff00">Mike said that was long enough.</font>

325
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,395
<font color="#ffff00">Canadians go all the time,
but God it was miserable cold.</font>

326
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,559
<font color="#ffff00">We sure had fun.</font>

327
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,440
<font color="#ffff00">That gulf water can wake you up.</font>

328
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,273
Good morning.

329
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,350
I've never seen so many books
in a house.

330
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,390
That's 'cause only fools read anymore.

331
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,512
You can have anything you like.
Whatever looks good.

332
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,276
For somebody who doesn't see a point
of school, how do you figure all these...

333
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,032
It's something else.

334
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,274
More like a... vain addiction, really.

335
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,309
I only read I had to, like the Bible.

336
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,952
Lot of good it did me.

337
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,839
I guess you think I've missed something.

338
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,633
Now that...

339
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,470
That may be a little bit tame for you,
but it's a great choice.

340
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,396
"No one who had ever seen
Catherine Moreland in her infancy

341
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,235
"would have supposed her
born to be a heroine.

342
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,908
"Her situation in life, the
character of her father and mother

343
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,198
"her own person and disposition,
were all equally against her."

344
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,032
Those are my odds.

345
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,629
"Her father was a clergyman

346
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,633
without being neglected or poor,
and a very respectable man..."

347
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,277
- Go on.
- I don't think so.

348
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,192
Well, take it, then.

349
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,235
You can join my fools' reading society.

350
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,153
Meetings nightly,
after lovemaking.

351
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,992
Lot of good it's done you.

352
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,312
Saved me from evil,
restored my soul,

353
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,673
brought peace
to my troubled mind,

354
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,199
and joy to my broken heart.

355
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,918
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not sure what Mike's gettin' at,</font>

356
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,597
<font color="#ffff00">but I liked this one.</font>

357
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,476
<font color="#ffff00">All that fuss over finding a man
isn't all that different now.</font>

358
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,394
<font color="#ffff00">Who's it gonna be, and when.</font>

359
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,188
<font color="#ffff00">And why.</font>

360
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,198
Never got around to it.

361
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,077
You don't want to let mother catch you.

362
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,799
She, uh... She might wonder what
you're doing on the job.

363
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,593
Take care.

364
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,235
<font color="#ffff00">Ricky is 100% of something
I would like to forget.</font>

365
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,276
Isn't it wonderful the way Austen
seems to dwell on the superficial

366
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,830
and the comic
and yet, all the while,

367
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,318
revealing the contradictions
and value systems

368
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,629
of an entire society?

369
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,393
I don't think there's been anyone
so subtle and elusive.

370
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,475
- What do you think?
- It was a neat story.

371
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,476
<font color="#ffff00">And Mike, I always feel good around him.</font>

372
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,069
<font color="#ffff00">He's like that red and blue sweater
I had when I was 13.</font>

373
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,797
<font color="#ffff00">So perfect.</font>

374
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,392
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted to wear it all the time,
even when it got hot.</font>

375
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,039
But sometimes...

376
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,474
<font color="#ffff00">Not always a pleasant feeling.</font>

377
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,108
- This is crap, let's go.
- This is a good part.

378
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,157
It's braindead, come on.

379
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,639
- Hey, Mike, I don't see
why we have to leave.
- This is garbage.

380
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,075
- What good does that do?
Can you tell me?
- It's just a movie.

381
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,073
It's bullshit.
It takes over your brain with

382
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,754
stupid fantasies that have
nothing to do with being alive.

383
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,195
Next thing you know, they're just
gonna wire you up and set you spinnin'.

384
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,717
- No screen, no popcorn, no nothing.
- Maybe sometimes that's okay.

385
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,836
- What gives you the right to know?
- Because it's so clear.

386
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,151
Well, to you, maybe.
It's not to other people.
They have to make up their own minds.

387
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,470
- Perhaps it's all they need.
- Do you really believe that?

388
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,632
I don't know, and I'm not deciding
right now, so don't press it.

389
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,190
- You wanna go back inside?
- And sit next to you when
I know you're miserable?

390
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,679
Morning.

391
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,993
So how's our #1 and
<i>only</i> salesperson today?

392
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,195
Fine, Ricky. And yourself?

393
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,310
I'm in the mood for
a night to remember.

394
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,471
I think we oughta
give it another go.

395
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,438
Not a good idea.
Least not right now.

396
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,596
Most people are only 2 paychecks
from the streets, did you know that?

397
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,636
I'll keep that in mind.

398
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,556
I didn't mean that, Ruby.

399
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,834
It's just, I can't
get you out of my mind.

400
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,031
I'm going to Bimini for a few days.
I'd like you to come with me.

401
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,996
- Why won't you just give me a chance?
- Ricky, that hurts!

402
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,675
Now's just not a good time.
Maybe after the holidays.

403
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,554
Yeah.

404
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,756
Yeah, we'll work it out.

405
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,398
Sorry.

406
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,789
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know why I just didn't tell him
right there I was seeing someone else.</font>

407
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,430
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe I didn't want that to mark me,
to be what I was.</font>

408
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,352
<font color="#ffff00">"Hands off,
I'm some other man's lady."</font>

409
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:52,256

410
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,918
<i>You never stay around
long enough to ask.</i>

411
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,153
<i>Oh, really? I'm here now!
What do you say about it now?</i>

412
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,433
<i>No! No!</i>

413
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,879
<i>Eddie, can't you stop him?</i>

414
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,272
<i>Eddie? Eddie's my friend, darling.
His old lady can't do a thing about that.</i>

415
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,232
I'm sorry to ask this.
But is it alright if I stay the night?

416
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,319
No problem.

417
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,069
Thanks.

418
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,479
Thanks, Ruby.

419
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,474
I'll be alright tomorrow.

420
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,877
I've grown so much
in the last two weeks.

421
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,352
You'll see.

422
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,355
<font color="#ffff00">Messes.
I've sure been there.</font>

423
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,712
<font color="#ffff00">And if I'm not careful...</font>

424
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,269
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody's fantasy...</font>

425
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,794
<font color="#ffff00">Tender unions,
precious ties...</font>

426
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,560
<font color="#ffff00">I wonder how many folks
get anywhere near.</font>

427
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,840
<font color="#ffff00">Mike's boss at the nursery
has a family.</font>

428
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,512
<font color="#ffff00">Everything is perfect.</font>

429
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,109
<font color="#ffff00">But from what I've seen, it's the woman who pays most for the dream of...</font>

430
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,115
<font color="#ffff00">security and belonging.</font>

431
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,913
<font color="#ffff00">Still, for some, there must not
be any charge at all.</font>

432
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,072
<font color="#ffff00">Like it comes without effort.
Like breathing.</font>

436
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,593
You all done?

437
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,079
No.

438
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,710
I put up with your garbage.
Now it's time for some inspiration.

439
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,357
<i>And move away from the selfish claims
of our wills and desires.</i>

440
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,671
<i>Oh, I know. Our pride objects.</i>

441
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,149
<i>Our petty spirits rebel.</i>

442
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,199
<i>But he knows we seek
limits to our lives.</i>

443
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,557
<i>That we are happy
only when we yield...</i>

444
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,757
Don't you love it? Just enough
truth to keep the sheep in line.

445
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,319
No. I don't love it.

446
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,479
You go ape over a dumb movie, and then
you put up with this, this kind of crap.

447
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,950
It's how most folks make do.

448
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,550
Is it how you make do?

449
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,718
I guess.

450
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,911
Way back, somewhere. I figure
there's a God out there.

451
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,788
But gentler, without the
harsh threats and the misery.

452
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,517
You can't have that kind of comfort
without the hell threat coming somewhere.

453
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,189
What?

454
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,713
<i>So clear and bright,</i>

455
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,755
<i>like a crystal beacon lit
2000 years ago and still shining.</i>

456
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,793
<i>Obey and be saved in love.</i>

457
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,112
<i>Turn away and be damned for all eternity.</i>

458
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,109
My family bought it all.

459
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,911
Hook, line, and sinker.

460
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,353
I grew up with the security and
certainty of living in the law.

461
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,077
I also know the guilt
and shame it can bring.

462
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,751
Nothing is ever gonna get
that kind of hold on me again.

463
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,232
My poor, tormented rebel from the law.

464
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,436
I'm not your poor anything.

465
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,350
I didn't mean any harm, Ruby.

466
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,239
Honest.

467
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,069
- Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

468
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,510
- Can you get the light?
- Yeah.

469
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,513
<font color="#ffff00">Emily. Mike's Emily.</font>

470

477
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,276
- Wish I had a set of these.
- Let's see the price.

478
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,712
Woody, I'll take a dozen
of each of the trays.

479
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,872
You keep all of this in your head?

480
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,312
Well, most of it doesn't change,
just the numbers.

481
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,755
and what you think
you can sell this year.

482
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,677
Ms. Chambers,
I need to know something.

483
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,598
Am I doing a good job?

484
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,757
Well, you still have a lot to learn.

485
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,399
But you're earning your money,
if that's what you mean.

486
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,348
I see.

487
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,072
Are you all packed?

488
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,997
- I'm all set.
- Good.

489
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,950
I'm glad we did that.
It's always good to go back to the
floor a second time on some things.

490
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,111
Especially,
with this new stuff.

491
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,872
But two days of it is enough
for any human being.

492
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,113
I've been coming to these things
for 20 years, I'm still afraid
I'm gonna forget something.

493
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:44,511
I'm gonna let you start driving.
I gotta take a nap.

494
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,514
Ruby!

495
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,829
Ricky. You scared the
damn hell outta me.

496
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,670
I'm sorry.
Can I come in?

497
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,593
It's really late.
I'm mighty tired.

498
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,668
Here.

499
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,190
Happy Valentine's Day.

500
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,718
Aren't you a little early?

501
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,589
Yeah. That's right.

502
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,873
Come in.

503
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,994
You want some coffee?

504
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,595
No, thanks, Ruby.
I'll be alright.

505
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,830
I've missed you
so much, Ruby.

506
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,436
More than I ever
thought possible.

507
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:36,430
Your mom and I just got back from Tampa.
I guess you've been to a lot of trade shows.

508
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,832
Not since I could say "no".

509
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,677
Your mom spent $6,000
in four hours on the floor.

510
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:48,152
Then we went to a big meeting about
tourism, and ate in a fancy restaurant,

511
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,552
and got some sleep before hitting
the floor again this morning, then
drove straight back through

512
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,997
so you can see how I'm real worn out.

513
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,868
Ruby!

514
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,910
I ain't seen anybody since you.
I got feelings, don't you understand?

515
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,190
I just need you to set them free.

516
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,954
And everything'll be all right.

517
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,714
Back, or I scream!

518
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,039
Get out of here, Ricky.

519
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,119
Ruby...

520
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,874
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby...

521
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,919
A man offers you his heart,
and look at you.

522
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,315
What's in this for you,
Miss Gissing?

523
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,795
If you're not careful, you're gonna
end up one lonely, cock-teasing bitch!

524
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,919
I should've known.

525
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,589
I don't wanna see you around.

526
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,196
In fact, don't even bother coming in
to work, 'cause you're fired. Terminated.

527
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,918
I'll send your last check here.

528
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,839
I think it's for the best, don't you?

529
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,599
I don't ever want to see you again.
I mean it.

530
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,349
<font color="#ffff00">Driving along the road once,
I swerved trying not to hit a rabbit,</font>

531
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,150
<font color="#ffff00">and ran smack over a skunk.</font>

532
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,395
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, Ricky.</font>

533
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,039
<font color="#ffff00">Guess nothing good can come
from being a fool.</font>

534
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,918
<font color="#ffff00">Goddamn Ricky and his line about folks
being 2 paychecks from the streets.</font>

535
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,751
<i>Just make this right, here, and you'll
get back on that main road.</i>

536
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,876
<font color="#ffff00">I met a family
from near back home.</font>

537
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,917
<i>Either that, or you want to take this...</i>

538
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,275
<font color="#ffff00">Everything they owned
was in their car.</font>

539
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,631
<font color="#ffff00">Out of work and on their way to Mobile
to stay with a cousin.</font>

540
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,039
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think the mom
was countin' on much.</font>

541
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,391
<font color="#ffff00">I gave them $10 for gas.</font>

542
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,277
<font color="#ffff00">Can't meet up with any more.
Not for a while, at least.</font>

543
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,479
<font color="#ffff00">Not until I'm settled again
and unbeholden.</font>

544
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,512
- Hey.
- Hi.

545
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,719
- How about a movie?
- I'm not feeling so good.

546
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,791
I think I've got the flu.

547
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,149
Really?  I'll come in and
make you some soup, then.

548
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:25,918
I think I should just sleep.

549
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,349
All right. You call me, alright?

550
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,195
Yeah.

551
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,596
Like a ghost,
I'm gonna haunt you.

552
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,034
No.

553
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,429
Well, I can do just about anything,
right there, I bet.

554
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,160
- No, I don't know.
- Are you sure? 'Cause there
are plenty of people in here.

555
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,313
I'm sure that you can add me right in,
and I can do something just fine for you!

556
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,432
Good afternoon,
may I help you?

557
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,948
No, um...

558
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,268
I was supposed to meet someone.
I guess he's not here.

559
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,634
No problem.

560
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,036
Did you know you're not
supposed to be here alone?

561
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,913
I sure didn't.

562
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,874
We'll be seeing you around.

563
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,393
<font color="#ffff00">Impressive stuff.</font>

564
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,253
<font color="#ffff00">To flaunt it in front of
paying customers.</font>

565
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,996
<font color="#ffff00">The ultimate merchandise.</font>

566
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,589
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe that's all there is.
We're all selling.</font>

567
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,829
<font color="#ffff00">Forget what's inside.
It's all in our skin...</font>

568
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,958
<font color="#ffff00">and in what touches it,
what covers it, what hides it.</font>

569
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,792
<font color="#ffff00">And what it can do.</font>

570
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,075
<font color="#ffff00">Too close to feeling gone.</font>

571
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,916
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

572
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,874
It was my problem,
I wanted to work it out myself.

573
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,793
Didn't you just tell me Old Lady Chambers
said you were doing a great job?

574
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,112
Why-- Why'd she fire you?

575
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:37,636
There was no traffic in the store.
She had to.

576
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,156
Typical. Money's tight,
forget the worker, save your own ass.

577
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,511
Not even a week's notice.

578
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,359
You'll get another job. And if you
need some money to see you through...

579
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,595
- It's all right.
- Ruby, you could always move in here.

580
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:02,151
Stay as long as you like.
I'll take real good care of you.

581
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,319
It'd be wonderful.

582
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,479
Every girl's dream.

583
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,669
Right.

584
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,799
Well, you think about it.

585
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,070
For now, I'll just settle for
what you got in that pan.

586
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,954
Saved it.

587
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,678
Okay. Welcome.

588
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,753
You take the top part of the sheet,
with the longest piece of hem...

589
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,230
you put it all in one hand,
you draw it out

590
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,029
and you set it in that basket.

591
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,072
The first day is always
the toughest, but you'll make it.

592
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,318
Though, none of us plan
to be here long, do we Wanda?

593
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,870
But sometimes...
What you been doing?

594
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,870
Sales. I've been in sales.

595
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,192
Much better choice.

596
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,876
The talkative one is Wanda.
I'm Persephina.

597
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,749
Ruby.

598
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,515
Well, Ruby, don't forget
to eat your Wheaties.

599
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,269
Don't worry. Pretty soon,
you won't feel a thing.

600
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,876
Why'd you wait
so long to tell me?

601
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,558
Didn't I warn you about that man?
Didn't I warn you?

602
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,191
Are you really mad or sad, Rochelle?

603
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,911
I could always join the Navy.

604
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,392
Sure. Or marry a preacher
and have 15 babies.

605
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,636
It's not your style, I'm afraid.

606
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,670
- I've got 50, 60 dollars maybe...
- No...

607
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,109
Yes. 50 would help.
Thanks.

608
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,314
You'll get it back.

609
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,838
<font color="#ffff00">On the edge of the edge,
a dream.</font>

610
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,115
<font color="#ffff00">Everyone I'd ever known was there.</font>

611
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,350
<font color="#ffff00">living on a beautiful mountain.</font>

612
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,875
<font color="#ffff00">We all did our share.
We all felt joy in being alive.</font>

613
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,394
<font color="#ffff00">Wild and free,

614

615
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,837
<font color="#ffff00">Beyond fantasy.</font>

616
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,353
<font color="#ffff00">Only there.</font>

617
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,153
<font color="#ffff00">Only there.</font>

618
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,394
Ruby ...

619
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,714
Are you awake?

620
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,238
Yeah, come on in.

621
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,995
- You okay?
- Yeah, I've just been keeping
some late hours, is all.

622
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,359
I brought you some chest pie.
It's the only thing my ma ever taught me.

623
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,917
- <i>Debrah Ann! You coming back
today sometime?</i>
- Coming, Jimmy.

624
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,797
I'll see you later.

625
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,668
"What's that thing between Daddy's legs?"

626
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:16,356
She says "Well, she's old enough to mind",
so she says, "That's how you get babies."

627
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,796
"You put Daddy's thing together with
Mommy's thing, that's how you get babies.

628
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,192
The girl, she's a little confused, she says:
"Mom, I was looking through the keyhole

629
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,112
and I saw Daddy's thing
in your mouth."

630
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:30,193
And she says
"Girl, that's how you get jewelry."

631
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,959
I heard that.

632
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,713
Looks like you're
getting the hang of it.

633
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,834
- I don't think so.
- Well, that's good.

634
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,034
Don't lose your mind.

635
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,673
Hello, Ruby.

636
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,313
Is it alright if I come in?

637
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,719
Thank you.

638
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,068
- Can I get you some tea?
- Oh, no thanks.

639
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,909
I paid for that.

640
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,637
I would never have
thought otherwise.

641
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,196
Ricky told me that you came by the store
with the car loaded and left for home.

642
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,351
Some emergency, he said.

643
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,391
I was furious and hurt that
you hadn't even said goodbye.

644
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,680
It wasn't until Rochelle called,
that I found out what really happened.

645
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,318
My son is a lot like his
long-forgotten ass of a father.

646
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:57,069
But I still have some hope for Ricky.
I know that must sound crazy.

647
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,958
But you've got more pressing
concerns at the moment.

648
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,473
I like mysteries.

649
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,152
Ones with women detectives.

650
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,152
I'd like to try one.

651
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,631
You know, when you first
came in the store,

652
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,912
I didn't really need anybody.

653
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,112
But I had a feeling about you.

654
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,714
You reminded me of something,
you were hungry.

655
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,872
There was a rage, and a...

656
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,032
fury that I recognized
from a long time ago.

657
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:46,912
A lot of good it's done me.

658
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,317
Most of us learn to lay low.

659
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,992
Sounds like dying.

660
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,156
Come on back
to the store, Ruby.

661
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,832
You're doing fine, and I need
an Assistant Manager with
energy and good ideas.

662
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,193
Besides, I'm thinking of opening
a second store, up the beach a ways.

663
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,392
Lord knows, the way this
country's going, maybe nobody's
ever gonna buy anything again, but...

664
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,393
Still, memories and dreams
are important.

665
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,351
And, so are beach towels, swimsuits,
and suntan lotion. We gotta be ready.

666
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,274
We'll have fun.

667
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,040
And Ricky <i>will</i> leave you alone.

668
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,871
All right, Mrs. Chambers.

669
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:47,835
Mildred.

670
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,668
- Mildred.
- Great.

671
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,716
And now I think
I would like that tea.

672
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:09,917
You going to wash in your dress clothes?

673
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,349
No.

674
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,868
I just came by to turn this in.
I got my old job back.

675
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,790
Just when you were getting
the knack of it.

676
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,073
Chambers Beach Emporium. Come by,
I'll give you a real good deal.

677
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,552
<i>- Wanda?
- Yeah.</i>

678
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:33,757
<font color="#ffff00">I dream about that room.</font>

679
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,835
<font color="#ffff00">And Wanda, and Persephina.</font>

680
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:45,557
<font color="#ffff00">Am I up to remembering that
we're all in the same world?</font>

681
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,875
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. I hope so.</font>

682
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,317
<font color="#ffff00">I know it won't be easy.</font>

683
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,550
Well, keep it up, girls. After this,
we're gonna tackle the upstairs.

684
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:09,269
At this rate, it's gonna take us
10 years to get the store restocked.

685
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,231
Y'all got enough stuff now?

686
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:42,149
I'll get the door for you.
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

687
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,755
Thanks a lot.
Tell your friends about us.

688
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,875
Thank God for spring.

689
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:57,039
And the "Best Buns on the Beach"
contest continues!

690
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:01,233
Ladies in the house, can you make some noise for contestant number 6, Jeff.

691
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,916
Is that you? Go do your duty, man. Ladies,
make some noise! Get this guy movin' for ya.

692
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:09,915
Wiggle it.
Not just a little bit.

693
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,833
Ladies, are you at Party Spring Break?
Make some noise!

694
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,273
Where's the party at?
Give it up!

695
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,959
Let's rock the house!
Shock the house!

696
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,793
It's Spring Break, y'all, time to
cut loose, on Panama City Beach.

697
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,030
How many people need sex on the beach
while you're here this weekend?

698
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,033
Safe sex, safe sex.

699
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,715
I'm gonna send out two girls right here
with some more t-shirts, guys.

700
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,277
Safe Spring Break party.
Don't drive while you're drunk.

701
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,829
Put your sunscreen on
and be sure...

702
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,753
to be safe with sex
on Panama City Beach.

703
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:20,159
The 3 big S's of Spring Break. Who needs
a t-shirt? My ladies have'em for ya.

704
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,594
You gotta make some noise, guys!
Where they goin'?

705
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,520
Spring Break capital of the
United States, Panama City Beach.

706
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,194
If you guys are feeling good,
make some noise!

707
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:55,792
- Not the most gorgeous shade of blue.
- Yeah, but one size fits all.

708
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,312
You got the other side?

709
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,598
- Okay.
- Let's go to work.

710
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,877
These knobs set your price, look through
the little window and make sure it's right.

711
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:05,314
Give it a good, hard squeeze,

712
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,835
and then just roll it..  on like that.

713
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,355
On someplace flat. Alright?
You wanna try?

714
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,950
Ruby...
Never mind.

715
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,237
- Rochelle ...
- Yes, Mrs. Chambers?

716
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,551
- Has the new stock been priced yet?
- The new girls are putting it on the floor.

717
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,153
Great, thank you.

718
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:50,834
It's nothing like when I first started.

719
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,998
You wouldn't believe the
inventory that we're moving.

720
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,791
We get all this stuff,
and the next day, it's gone.

721
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,111
Mildred says it's a buying frenzy.
Like it's contagious, or something.

722
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,272
What do you think about all this,
Rochelle?

723
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:07,234
It's what we're gettin' paid for, isn't it?
When the fish bite, enjoy.

724
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,432
- Like lemmings to the sea.
- What?

725
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,234
Nothing.

726
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,952
Beats not working.

727
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,479
There were other options.

728
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:31,509
What do you mean?

729
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,110
No matter how much they mess things up,
there's always the ocean.

730
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,954
Yeah.

731
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,829
Polluted and dying.
There it is.

732
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:16,556
I'm glad you finally called me. I was
beginning to think I was a leper or something.

733
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,878
I got caught up in gettin'
the store ready for spring.

734
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,749
It can't mean anything,
going back to the selling game.

735
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,912
It doesn't mean anything
It can't be the reason you're here.

736
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,600
It's a game whose rules I understand.

737
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,118
And for a while, at least, that's
just gonna have to be enough.

738
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,235
What are you really
trying to say, anyway?

739
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,036
It's better than
having no game at all.

740
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:11,112
You and all of your
gloom and doom crap, man.

741
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,591
Do something about it
or leave it alone.

742
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,915
Just please stop looking down
at the rest of us.

743
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,713
You're absolutely right.

744
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:34,239
I'm sorry.

745
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,193
Me too.

746
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,275
<font color="#ffff00">That's when I started
seeing less of Mike.</font>

747
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,477
<font color="#ffff00">We go to movies and stuff,</font>

748
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:19,116
<font color="#ffff00">but we get uncomfortable if
we stay together for too long.</font>

749
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,550
<font color="#ffff00">He's working on something.
One of his causes again.</font>

750
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:27,393
<font color="#ffff00">But he won't say what.</font>

751
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,392
<font color="#ffff00">May be afraid of losing it.</font>

752
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,439
<font color="#ffff00">I understand.</font>

753
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,111
<font color="#ffff00">I hope we keep in touch.</font>

754
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:47,110
<font color="#ffff00">Somewhere I heard that "Hell is
when all your dreams come true.</font>

755
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,710
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe it's because you find out,
they won't all go together.</font>

756
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,958
<font color="#ffff00">Or that there's always sides you
can't see when you're dreaming away.</font>

757
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,798
I won't be staying long.

758
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:08,670
I just wanted to tell you
how much I regret what happened.

759
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,272
I'm in counseling now.

760
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:17,436
"Getting in touch with myself,"
they call it.

761
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,394
Becoming a new man.

762
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:29,716
I just wanted to apologize,
that's all.

763
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,913
Maybe I'll see you around?

764
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,952
Business is booming.

765
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,717
While we have a free moment...

766
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,553
Thanks, Rochelle.
It was a real help.

767
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:55,110
Oh, yeah.
I'd forgotten. Almost.

768
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,195
By rights, Mildred should
have made you Assistant.

769
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:06,792
Nah, after this summer, Mildred
won't be able to afford this one here.

770
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:11,189
Billy finishes school in December.
And I'll have my degree, and...

771
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,998
we'll be straight.

772
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,514
I hope.

773
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:03,793
Hello.

774
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,869
Hello.

775
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,836
- Did you used to work over at Porter's Court?
- Oh, my uncle's place.

776
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:11,594
I still do.

777
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,594
He and my father just bought this complex,
and we're fixing it up.

778
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,834
- Do you live here?
- Yeah, I do.

779
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:24,117
- Would you like to have some tea?
- Sure.

780
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:39,358
What about that song?

781
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,438
Prayers to Shiva,
who is everything.

782
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,513
Everything?

783
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,430
When my family came here,
we were skin and bones.

784
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,315
I mean it, we were skin and bones.

785
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,198
But four years later, and look at me now.
I'm so healthy, don't you think?

786
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,437
- Don't you miss your home?
- This is home now.

787
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:07,469
- Everyone wants to be here.
- It doesn't make it right.

788
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,833
It is, for now,
the great dream of the world.

789
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,515
Whether it's right or wrong,
that's always much harder.

790
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,191
It really is a beautiful song.

791
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,558
Maybe you'd like to learn it?

792
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,831
- <i>Good morning, Mr. Roberts.</i>
- <i>Mornin'.</i>

793
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,790
<font color="#ffff00">Suppose it means more.</font>

794
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:55,591
<font color="#ffff00">Making it in some
big great city somewhere.</font>

795
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,595
<font color="#ffff00">But this is the world I found.</font>

796
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,393
<font color="#ffff00">And I guess the questions
stay the same.</font>

797
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,558
Mornin', Ruby.

798
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,155
<font color="#ffff00">Like, where does caring come from?</font>

799
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,472
<font color="#ffff00">Can we ever know our true desires?</font>

800
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:37,358
<font color="#ffff00">And why are we, all of us,
so often lonely and afraid?</font>

801
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,515
<font color="#ffff00">The answers are probably
real simple and real close.</font>

802
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,716
<font color="#ffff00">Smiling somewhere, quiet-like.</font>

803
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,151
<font color="#ffff00">Waiting, for us.</font>

804
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,518
Mornin', everybody.
