This chapter deals with

The second law of thermodynamics.

The primary element of this law

409

is a word that we use all the time,
though it's tough to define.

410

That word is "heat".

What is heat, anyway?

412
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:21,411
A simple definition is this.

413
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:25,114
Heat is the energy possessed by molecules

414
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,483
