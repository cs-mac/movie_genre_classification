1
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:10,245
Therefore, I declare
you husband and wife.

2
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,845
Congratulations, Albert.

3
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,103
And you too, Anna.

4
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,498
You are a lucky couple.

5
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,187
Thanks to the Baron.

6
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:27,388
Not all masters give their
servants a beautiful wedding.

7
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:28,074
Nonsense, nonsense.

8
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:29,914
Albert has been part of
this family all his life.

9
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:32,150
Before him, his father
was already part of her.

10
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:36,204
And I do not know what the Baroness
would do without our little anarchy.

11
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,053
I hope you are very happy, dear.

12
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:42,715
If Albert is half as a
good husband as a butler,

13
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,864
You will not have cause for complaint.

14
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:48,774
A small gift.

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,826
Of the Baroness and a server.

16
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:53,027
You know, a good pipe is
the only rival of a woman.

17
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,146
Thank you very much. Thank you.

18
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:57,178
The coat of arms of the family.

19
00:01:57,303 --> 00:01:59,887
The von Burgen crest for me?

20
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:01,108
Why not?

21
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,893
I'm sure it means a lot more to
you than to any of my family.

22
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:06,291
That's right, Lord.

23
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:09,434
And when I have a
child, I hope that...

24
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,046
Good...

25
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:16,205
Well, everything in its time, Lord.

26
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,598
Congratulations, Albert.

27
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:19,713
And you too, Anna.

28
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:21,495
Good...

29
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:22,838
Good...

30
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:25,617
I will prepare a snack
for the guests.

31
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,047
And today the servants...?

32
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:29,341
We will have a small dinner
on the ground floor, sir.

33
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:32,186
I see. I see. I trust you
to organize things, Albert.

34
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:33,669
Thank my Lord.

35
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,004
We just started with
the new fresh grapes.

36
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,650
And we were wondering if the
bride would step on them for us.

37
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:42,998
Young wine and a fertile bride.

38
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:11,165
Yupi!

39
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,599
Are you Karl Schneider?

40
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:18,455
Yes.

41
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:19,659
Go up and wait in the kitchen.

42
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,160
What wait in the kitchen?

43
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,300
It must be an error, Excellency.

44
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:24,347
The new driver, right?

45
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:25,283
Yes.

46
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:26,606
Someone told me to tell you.

47
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,409
Hears!

48
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,671
Hey, you owe me 5 cents.

49
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:33,616
It's okay.

50
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:35,758
Here you have.

51
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,024
Where is everybody?

52
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,025
At the wedding.

53
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,375
Yes. Everyone is at the wedding.

54
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,286
Glad to be here, right?

55
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,892
Yes. We have come alone
for the weekend.

56
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:37,212
I'm with the Countess.

57
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,309
We are from Paris.

58
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,385
Of course, you can see
that you are from Paris;

59
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,158
It shows to the league.

60
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,391
I feel so uncomfortable here.

61
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,077
These provincials are so...

62
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:49,085
Oh, I know.
They are just a bunch of servants.

63
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:51,921
Give them enough food and wine...
and they will be satisfied.

64
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,866
We are different.

65
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:55,228
Oh, you're very right.

66
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,577
Of course, I'm just a driver.

67
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,592
I travel, I see the world...

68
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,962
I try to instruct myself.
And see people.

69
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:05,803
Hey, tell me...

70
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,508
Do you have to stay with
the Countess every night?

71
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,397
Oh yeah!

72
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:12,174
I always have to be with
her in the same room.

73
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,672
Any free night?

74
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,178
Do not.

75
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,148
Well, Albert...

76
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,824
we should kiss the bride.

77
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,689
Oh, good news.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,840
Oh, do not worry.
I am the new driver.

79
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,224
An unusual wedding.

80
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,304
Yes.

81
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,735
One does not distinguish the servants.

82
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,260
Have you known von
Burgen for a long time?

83
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:13,888
No, not much.

84
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,494
I met them through the Rothschilds.

85
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:16,983
The Rothschilds?

86
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,749
Do you work in banking?

87
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,176
No, cars.

88
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:22,121
Can I have a sandwich?

89
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,208
- No more missing.
- How is it going?

90
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,229
Countess!

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,493
Oh, I see they know each other.

92
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,016
- Thank you.
- I have not had that pleasure yet.

93
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,524
I'll leave you with the Countess.

94
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:30,651
I hope to see you again.

95
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,742
Thank you.

96
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,628
What are you doing here?

97
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,418
Now I am the new driver.

98
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,271
But you can not work here.

99
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:39,683
I have the best references.

100
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:42,431
Even one that you wrote, Ma'am.

101
00:06:42,564 --> 00:06:44,012
I dictated it to you.

102
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,853
You are a shameless man!

103
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,934
I thought that the Lady had
been entirely satisfied.

104
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,587
You can not work here.
You can not.

105
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,608
The Baroness is my friend.

106
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,246
If you do not leave right
away, I'll tell you...

107
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,100
Here comes the Baroness.
I'll tell him myself.

108
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:58,379
Karl Schneider. The new driver
At your complete disposal, Madam.

109
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,891
Oh, from the employment agency?

110
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:03,805
And before committing myself, Countess
De Marnac would like you to know...

111
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,401
Only, my dear Eloise, who
was my driver last winter.

112
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,893
He is an excellent driver.

113
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,130
The lady is very kind.

114
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:12,088
It seems that Albert is
somewhat lost today.

115
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,583
It is better to go to
the servants' quarters.

116
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,170
Countess.

117
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:37,964
Are you the cook?

118
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,442
Do I look like a cook?

119
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,370
Oh me...

120
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,547
I have not seen His Royal Highness before.

121
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,548
What?

122
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:45,471
And who are you?

123
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:46,472
The new driver.

124
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:48,009
I would like to have dinner.

125
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:49,661
Dine?

126
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:51,144
First of all, I'd
like some caviar.

127
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:53,508
And then, some onion soup.

128
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,167
Salad, of course.
The crab is my favorite.

129
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:59,485
And... and... a good slice
of undercooked roast beef.

130
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:04,343
And perhaps His Excellency would
like to be taken to his quarters?

131
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:06,704
No. I'm not fussy.
I will have dinner here.

132
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:07,808
The drivers are all the same.

133
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,075
Some useless lazy!

134
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:10,463
- Oh, Karl.
- Yes?

135
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,291
I am sorry. I did not have an
opportunity to talk to you.

136
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,565
Oh, I understand. It's okay.

137
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,444
Congratulations.

138
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:16,706
Oh thanks. Thank you.

139
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,471
Everything fixed, huh? Oh yeah.

140
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:19,912
- You have a place to sleep.
- Great.

141
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:22,225
Well, good night.

142
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:25,532
I do not have to wish you good night.

143
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,168
Goodnight.

144
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:30,550
Yes.

145
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,635
I must cross the threshold
with the bride in my arms.

146
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:44,778
Oh, Albert. Is beautiful.

147
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:47,648
We practically have two rooms.

148
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:52,257
Oh, Anna.

149
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,818
Now close your eyes.

150
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:54,914
And come here.

151
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:55,996
Do not look.

152
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,164
Do not look.

153
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:09,071
A radio!

154
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,962
Oh, Albert, you're so good to me.

155
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,741
No no. No no no no.

156
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:16,629
No, it's not nonsense.
It's true.

157
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,229
Albert, when I arrived here...

158
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,431
she was just a
scary kitchen helper.

159
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:22,977
All he could say was "yes,
sir" and "no, sir".

160
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,320
You remember?

161
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,793
Then you taught me to be a servant.

162
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,580
Then to be the maid
of the Baroness.

163
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,709
And now, you marry me.

164
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,618
Oh, Albert. I'm very grateful.

165
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,724
Forget about being grateful.

166
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,438
Be happy. That is all.

167
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:44,595
Always happy.

168
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,050
No, not that one.

169
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,272
Cast the jack.

170
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,152
Françoise, you're drunk.

171
00:10:52,536 --> 00:10:54,334
I also!

172
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,420
Oh, Albert.

173
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,548
All the other maids envy me.

174
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,016
With that distinguished air
and your pretty sideburns.

175
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:09,830
Well, better worry about
your business, young lady...

176
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,642
or lose your handsome husband.

177
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,078
Oh, do not think you scare me.

178
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,496
You're just a stubborn old man.

179
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,550
Oh, but a sweet one.

180
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:21,168
Please, say you will always love me.

181
00:11:21,169 --> 00:11:22,581
Always, my love.

182
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:23,816
Because...!

183
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,330
No no. For! Anna, please. No no.

184
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,956
Albert, not tonight.

185
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:40,436
Timbrazo Timbrazo Timbrazo.

186
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,743
They are not able to look at a
doorbell without pressing it.

187
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:47,792
Is not Françoise tonight
in charge of everything?

188
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,662
Yes, dear, but something
must have happened.

189
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,648
Oh, that's it.
It's already going.

190
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,801
But do not worry, dear.

191
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,443
My father was a butler...

192
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,524
and had nine children
between ringing and ringing.

193
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,335
But I do not want to go to bed.

194
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,381
You have already served enough for today.

195
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:25,582
I do not want to go to bed.

196
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,296
That will be it,
Françoise, for tonight.

197
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:33,838
I'm sorry Mr.

198
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,338
I will stay and serve the guests.

199
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,768
Cognac or pipermin?

200
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,323
Cognac, good man.

201
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,310
My mother also used to keep her
wedding ring in a showcase like that.

202
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,041
Forgive me for watching.

203
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,879
It made me feel nostalgic.

204
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:18,867
Do you live far away?

205
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,037
I lost it when I was a kid.

206
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,152
Oh, how sad.

207
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,561
He also used to do that.

208
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:31,630
It always kept it
bright and shiny.

209
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:33,311
Once when I was a kid,

210
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,583
I threw it playing and I broke it.

211
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,937
I cried. And my mother cried.

212
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:41,728
And I started saving
to buy a new one.

213
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,094
It was so small and
it took me so long...

214
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:47,346
that when I finally saved enough...
it was too late.

215
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,621
It means that...?

216
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,719
Instead I bought her
a wreath of flowers.

217
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:54,079
Oh poor.

218
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,574
I did not want to tell my
problems to a stranger.

219
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,885
Especially tonight, when
I should be so happy.

220
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,883
Oh, you must not think we're strangers.

221
00:13:59,884 --> 00:14:01,625
Here you will feel at home.

222
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:04,703
I have been happier here than I
have been in my entire life.

223
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,030
I waited.

224
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,674
Let me fix it.

225
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,014
It is done.

226
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,146
A little kiss and I'll say good night.

227
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,891
It is the title of the
song that is playing.

228
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,362
Good evening, Eric.

229
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:28,769
It's Albert!

230
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,397
It is better to leave.

231
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:32,741
It's okay.

232
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:38,665
Anna.

233
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,778
Yes sir?

234
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,575
Anna, I'm going to get mad at you...

235
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:50,546
and you're going to
win a good reprimand.

236
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,798
How many times have I told
you not to call me "Lord"?

237
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,464
Oh, Albert.

238
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:57,743
For a moment I really thought
you were angry with me.

239
00:14:57,744 --> 00:14:59,610
Oh darling.

240
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:02,501
It would not scare you for
anything in the world.

241
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:04,344
Hold me tight, Albert.

242
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:08,730
Do not let anything happen to
you, or to me, or to our home.

243
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,944
What an appetite!

244
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:22,096
Just a little bit, Sophie.

245
00:15:34,343 --> 00:15:35,826
Wow!

246
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,738
Careful, Sophie.

247
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:42,499
You could fall and break that gossip.

248
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:46,109
You have flour in your thing.

249
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,720
Shake it, will you?

250
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,337
<i>Domestic chores.</i>

251
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:02,921
<i>Driver - Take the Baroness to Vienna
at 10 o'clock - Take the cabriolet.</i>

252
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,219
Thank you.

253
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,359
Excuse me.

254
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,293
Do you mind taking the
wheel for a moment, Ma'am?

255
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:27,437
My ring has caught on his hair.
Oh yeah.

256
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,533
Excuse me, ma'am.

257
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:36,937
Oh, it's a woman's ring.

258
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,108
It was a woman's ring.

259
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:48,072
How long were you with the Countess?

260
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,446
Almost two years, Ma'am.

261
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:55,106
The Countess said that you
are a very discreet man.

262
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:03,091
The Lady can trust me to remember
everything and... forget everything.

263
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,963
Take me to 18 Louisa Strasse.

264
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,500
Yes ma'am.

265
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,754
Thank you very much.

266
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,741
The key to your wallet, Ma'am.

267
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,524
Thank you.

268
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,906
My coat, Lady.

269
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:42,382
Oh, no, no, no. You will freeze.

270
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,490
I'm always hot, ma'am.

271
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:58,782
Excuse me, ma'am.

272
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,343
Thanks, Karl.

273
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,309
Make Anna come up right away, please.

274
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,416
Yes ma'am.

275
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,364
The car broke down.

276
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,386
Yes ma'am.

277
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,591
Hey, what kind of accident did you have?

278
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:12,101
Anyone who believes Your Honor.

279
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,499
Your Honor?

280
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,851
The boss. The Baron.

281
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:17,828
You can not be disrespectful
and stay here, Karl.

282
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,976
I have not been disrespectful
to you, right?

283
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:23,605
The very basis of our principles
is respect for those above.

284
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,251
I respect you and your wife
because you behave well...

285
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,252
Okay, Karl!

286
00:20:27,677 --> 00:20:29,786
Let me talk to you expensive.

287
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,623
I've known this kind of thing since
I was about seven years old.

288
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,807
We have not had any accidents.

289
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:38,856
We stopped in a strange alley...

290
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,953
The Baroness said you
had an accident.

291
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,529
Well, do you want me to
respect her for that?

292
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:49,321
If we criticize them...
that is, those below

293
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:52,253
we stop being raised.

294
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,014
We have broken our code.

295
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,924
You know, as servants,
we do not make life;

296
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,082
It is made for us.

297
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:02,830
While we are capable, we
serve you the best we can.

298
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,144
But if we grow old or... get
sick, they take care of us.

299
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:11,407
And if they make a mistake,
we turn a blind eye, huh?

300
00:21:11,408 --> 00:21:14,050
You do not have to listen
unless you want to stay here.

301
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:16,810
When they are wrong...

302
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:21,172
What right do we have to judge
whether it is right or wrong?

303
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,676
If a servant falls apart,
yes, I understand.

304
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:27,931
Down life is very simple.

305
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:30,883
But above, the rules are different.

306
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,765
And there is no relationship,
but a desire for service;

307
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:39,152
There are no feelings, but a
deep loyalty and protection.

308
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,124
Yes, I get it.

309
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,624
Fred Albert, I want to inform...

310
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,866
that the Baroness had
a mishap with the car.

311
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,100
That has delayed her a bit.

312
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,150
Well, I'm sure...

313
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:56,886
Hey, I trust you
to conform to us.

314
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:58,664
You know I like you.

315
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,187
To my wife too.

316
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,539
I like your wife.

317
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:02,890
You too.

318
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,835
You know, Albert...

319
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:09,852
I would like us to meet
and talk very seriously.

320
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,093
- Agree.
- Why...

321
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:14,062
I will respect the Baroness
if you want me to do it.

322
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:18,408
I'll even respect that kind of fool of
the Baroness, if that makes you happy.

323
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,694
You are just what we needed, Karl.

324
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,879
Someone to drink and laugh with.

325
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,819
In fact, sometimes
it's a bit boring.

326
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,060
Oh, Albert!

327
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:50,640
No, darling. I'm just saying it's not
like it used to be in the old days.

328
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,999
You would not believe it seeing him now,

329
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,063
but the Baron was a savage
when he was younger.

330
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:57,253
Oh, back then I was in
the Imperial Guard.

331
00:22:57,254 --> 00:23:00,084
And every weekend, it
filled the officers' house.

332
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:01,908
And they all brought their girls.

333
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,255
Well, he behaved very badly, and
finally the Emperor intervened.

334
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,445
But while it lasted, it was
a wild and happy time.

335
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:10,562
Many tips, Albert, huh?

336
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:11,565
Tips?

337
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:14,230
Well, once we argue among ourselves.

338
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:17,673
He had gotten so drunk he wanted
to appear before the Emperor

339
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:19,268
with his uniform,
from the waist up,

340
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,329
and nothing, except his sword...

341
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,802
and his underpants, underneath.

342
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,656
I had to chase him on his
way to town with his pants.

343
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:29,402
And he gave me 100 crowns for them.

344
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,134
- Do not!
- Yes sir.

345
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:34,837
You young people do not know
what it was like before the war.

346
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,323
Oh, Karl. Too many cigarettes.

347
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,889
You must taste a good tobacco.
Like this.

348
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,294
You know?
I worked for an American.

349
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,010
Karl, there you have it: Americans.

350
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,500
Why a lot of money if you do
not know how to enjoy it?

351
00:23:52,507 --> 00:23:56,023
I remember that the Baron had
here, once, the cream of Belais.

352
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,491
At 30.

353
00:23:58,598 --> 00:23:59,773
Well, sir...

354
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:01,064
Sorry.

355
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:03,336
Well, I'll tell you later.

356
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:04,803
Come on, Albert.
You are very cruel.

357
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,607
No no. No way.
You are a newlywed.

358
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:10,175
These newly married women want
to know everything right away.

359
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:11,479
All!

360
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:13,737
Your Lordships again.

361
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:14,886
Yes.

362
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,239
No, Karl. You stay.

363
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,085
Take another coffee with Anna.
I will be back.

364
00:24:19,086 --> 00:24:21,443
And do not forget, we still
have to talk seriously.

365
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,730
You can bet on it. Clear.

366
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,332
Come back soon, Albert.

367
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:38,063
You know? Sometimes I would
like to have a place like this.

368
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:39,521
Maybe one day.

369
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:41,559
No I do not.

370
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,113
Something in my blood...

371
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:46,723
makes it never stand still;

372
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:49,160
Something wild pulls me.

373
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,822
I get it.

374
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,269
I used to dream about places
where I would like to go.

375
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:54,841
Paris.

376
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,041
London.

377
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:57,195
America.

378
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,645
Have you never been away from here?

379
00:24:58,646 --> 00:25:00,178
Not too far.

380
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:05,538
How fun it would be to show you
some of the places I've seen.

381
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:07,873
You would love Paris.

382
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:11,106
Maybe one day the Baroness will
take me to Paris with her.

383
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,002
And Monte Carlo.

384
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:21,178
There is a place on the hill where
you can dine in the moonlight.

385
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,733
You can see Corsica.

386
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,666
Geez, it's beautiful.

387
00:25:25,973 --> 00:25:28,494
I do not understand why you
want to establish yourself.

388
00:25:28,915 --> 00:25:32,746
If I were a man, I would like to
continue traveling and traveling.

389
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,576
He has his good things.

390
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:38,538
Sometimes it seems to me that
I have to leave a place.

391
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,927
Something happens...

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,454
My bags are made.

393
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:45,097
I'm on the move...

394
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:50,273
Alone.

395
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,119
It's getting cold, is not it?

396
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,196
Well, let's go inside.

397
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,581
It's been great to come and
chat with you tonight.

398
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,386
It makes me realize
what I've missed.

399
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:20,140
Albert always asks the new ones
to come and have coffee with him.

400
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,614
I'm thankful.

401
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:24,538
I have a friendly interest towards you.

402
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:27,277
I feel like you're my sister.

403
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,676
You do not care about
this feeling, right?

404
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:30,563
Do not.

405
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:31,913
Oh thanks.

406
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,537
Thank you.

407
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,522
Do not do it again or...

408
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:39,392
Or what?

409
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:40,822
I will tell my husband.

410
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:42,385
I will tell him myself.

411
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:44,637
Hi, Albert.

412
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:45,684
Hi.

413
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,309
I wanted to tell you...

414
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,976
That if there are no more orders tonight,

415
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:50,692
I would like to go to bed early.

416
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,148
To the bed? What nonsense!

417
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,982
Who do you think I
bring beer with?

418
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:54,845
Albert!

419
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,321
If you do not mind, I'll take
it and finish it in my room.

420
00:26:58,628 --> 00:27:00,132
Goodnight.

421
00:27:00,512 --> 00:27:02,155
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

422
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:05,932
What's wrong?

423
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:07,690
Is that...

424
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,237
I do not want him here.

425
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:11,134
Why? Karl is a good guy.

426
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,297
I know but...

427
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,316
Oh, no, dear. You are tired.
That is all.

428
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,971
Now go to bed while
I finish my beer.

429
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,386
But good.

430
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:37,731
Very shameless.

431
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:40,071
Come and sit in my room without...

432
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,965
without something like a "please"
or a "with your permission".

433
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,420
And you smell like onion. Phew!

434
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,744
But last night...

435
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,381
Well, what about last night?

436
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:50,225
I thought that...

437
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:50,755
Did you believe?

438
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:54,936
Hey, who do you think I am? A train
that departs according to the schedule?

439
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,545
Last night was last night.

440
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,076
And good?

441
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,314
I just wanted to bring you some dessert.

442
00:28:01,315 --> 00:28:02,439
Dessert?

443
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:04,691
Food, food, food.

444
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:07,889
Do you ever think of something else?
You are like a walking refrigerator.

445
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,474
Do not insult me, please...

446
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:14,116
treating me like a pig
to get fat for the market.

447
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:18,639
Ah, Sophie...

448
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,975
There are better things in
life than eating, or drinking.

449
00:28:23,055 --> 00:28:25,392
Things better than the
pleasures of the moment.

450
00:28:25,978 --> 00:28:27,076
Or of the hour.

451
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:28,077
Sophie...

452
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:31,267
do you know what I said to
myself the first time I saw you?

453
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:36,053
I told myself "this is
a woman with a soul".

454
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:38,866
But Sophie...

455
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,272
you disappoint me.

456
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,750
Oh, oh, Sophie.

457
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,901
Ya, ya. I spoke too harshly.

458
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,466
But I'm very nervous.

459
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,673
It's the mixture of blood in my veins.

460
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:08,457
Sophie, if I told you
about my ancestors...

461
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:10,978
My father was...

462
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:13,149
You would not believe me if I told you.

463
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,291
Oh, I would.

464
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:18,596
Anyone would know that
you are a gentleman.

465
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:19,706
A gentleman?

466
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,386
My dear Sophie...

467
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,468
my father was a Grande from Spain.

468
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:32,674
And my mother...

469
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:34,439
How much he suffered!

470
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,721
Trying to hide your
secret with pride.

471
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,419
Without any of the sacred memories
of other women's marriage.

472
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,337
Without wedding ring.
Without wedding garland.

473
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:45,425
Only one son...

474
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:48,476
that he could not carry
his father's last name.

475
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:52,878
Sophie.

476
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:55,761
You should not keep your
money in the average.

477
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,201
But there he is sure.

478
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,608
I know but...

479
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:00,774
It ruins the shape of your leg.

480
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:07,926
Wow. Please, take it, Anna.

481
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:08,881
Buy it for you.

482
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:10,881
One day I took the
Baroness to the city.

483
00:30:10,882 --> 00:30:12,900
No, Karl, I do not want it.

484
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:18,433
Despite how much I try to please
you, everything I do is wrong.

485
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:22,221
Did not I apologize for
kissing you that night?

486
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,559
Have not I behaved
well since then?

487
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,583
Almost always.

488
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,973
Are you not all happy with me?

489
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:35,367
Even Albert?

490
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,849
Is there someone you
have not been kind to?

491
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,644
Yes; Sophie.

492
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,410
You made him believe that you cared.

493
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:42,638
Sophie, well...

494
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:45,047
And I really care.

495
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:48,744
I feel towards Sophie as
if she were my mother.

496
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:49,889
Your mother?

497
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,831
Well, what else could I feel?

498
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:54,724
Because, Anna, do not you think...?

499
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
True?

500
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:57,743
Do not.

501
00:30:57,744 --> 00:30:58,924
Good.

502
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,056
Poor Sophie.

503
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,474
He has worked so hard
all these years,

504
00:31:04,475 --> 00:31:06,722
Sweating the fat drop in the kitchen.

505
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:09,621
Now that you are older and less
attractive, what do you have left?

506
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,852
A lot of money.
And what is that?

507
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:14,557
I'm sorry I talked about her.

508
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,341
We all make mistakes.

509
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:18,857
Look...

510
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:20,761
it goes this way, Anna.

511
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:24,759
Anna.

512
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,436
The Baroness wants to
see you right now.

513
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:28,162
We will go fishing tomorrow.

514
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,356
Very good, Albert.

515
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:30,944
And you, Karl,

516
00:31:30,945 --> 00:31:34,809
You will go for the Baron's fishing rod
to the warehouse and take it upstairs.

517
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,068
All right.

518
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,646
What do I do with these, ma'am?

519
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,863
Those?
You can keep them if you like them.

520
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:54,612
Those water spots never came out.

521
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,156
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

522
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:58,527
Where did you get that brooch?

523
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:01,183
It's mine.

524
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,366
I'm sure it's mine
I just bought it.

525
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,021
What are you doing with him?

526
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:10,064
And good?

527
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,508
Because you do not answer?

528
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,770
Have you stolen it?

529
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:16,337
Oh, no, ma'am.
It can not be yours.

530
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,519
Oh, do not be ridiculous.

531
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,042
Of course it's mine.

532
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,000
Do not I know my own jewels?

533
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,253
To think that a girl like you,

534
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:26,905
raised in our own house,

535
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:28,152
I can be a vulgar thief.

536
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:29,253
Forgive me, lady.

537
00:32:30,797 --> 00:32:32,152
I could not help but hear him.

538
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,654
Could not you avoid hearing what?

539
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,230
Call Anna a thief.

540
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,863
And what should I call it?
Duchess?

541
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,147
No ma'am.

542
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:42,591
The brooch that Anna
carries is not yours.

543
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,136
I gave it to him.

544
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:46,091
A wedding gift.

545
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:48,339
Did you give it to him?

546
00:32:49,432 --> 00:32:52,625
I got it in a small house
on the Louisa Strasse.

547
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:56,738
Louisa Strasse?

548
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,632
The Lady, probably, does
not know that street.

549
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:01,724
His name is not very lucky.

550
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:04,643
I can give you the address,
if you're interested.

551
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:07,050
- Number...
- I'm not interested.

552
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:09,156
As the Lady wishes.

553
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:12,009
But I can assure you, Madam,

554
00:33:12,137 --> 00:33:13,634
that the brooch is not yours.

555
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,122
I was wrong.

556
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,173
It is not mine.

557
00:33:22,693 --> 00:33:23,781
I'm sorry, Anna.

558
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,928
Oh, please, Madam.

559
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,231
You can go.

560
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:39,775
I do not know how to thank you...

561
00:33:40,262 --> 00:33:42,491
putting you on my side
in front of the Baroness.

562
00:33:42,592 --> 00:33:43,648
Oh, it's nothing.

563
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:47,996
I could not see anyone unjustly
accused, even if it costs me the job.

564
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:52,254
Well, I think you were fantastic.

565
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:53,904
Was nothing.

566
00:33:53,905 --> 00:33:55,620
I would do it for anyone.

567
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:00,255
Dear. At this time, tomorrow
night, we will be on the ship.

568
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,297
Rights to deep water
and big fish.

569
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:08,870
Oh, I do not like the idea of
smelling fish during the weekend.

570
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:10,154
Go, go, dear.

571
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:14,276
There are worse things than fish
to smell during the weekend.

572
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:15,859
That reminds me...

573
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,006
I have to take the new
pills for the liver...

574
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:21,539
my dyspeptic tablets and
something in case I get dizzy.

575
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:24,155
Nicky.

576
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:27,878
Are you going to stop imagining
that you have something wrong?

577
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,883
You have an iron health.

578
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:33,160
This always stops hiccups.

579
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:35,674
We better suspend that fishing trip.

580
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:36,843
But why?

581
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,691
Because you expect to get sick.

582
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:40,279
Who said he was sick?

583
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,446
I have not felt better in my life.

584
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,141
I'm just thinking about your happiness.

585
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:46,734
I am a lucky man,

586
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:49,756
especially in this day of intrigue and
scandal, of having a wife like you.

587
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:50,645
Scandal?

588
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,933
Yesterday I heard that old von
Rappan's wife had a lover!

589
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,108
And what did you expect?

590
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,129
He is 80 She 23.

591
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,738
And he has asthma.

592
00:34:57,739 --> 00:35:00,623
Well, there are a lot of
remedies for asthma today.

593
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:07,582
It worries me much more, Nicky,

594
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,721
having a little scandal
in our own house.

595
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,780
A scandal in this house?
Impossible.

596
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,217
However, it concerns Albert.

597
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:16,379
Albert?

598
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,606
But if he just got married.

599
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:20,451
It is clear that he can not
be dissatisfied anymore.

600
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,477
It's not Albert...

601
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,663
but his wife.

602
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,685
And Karl, the new driver.

603
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,698
He has given him a jewel.

604
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,527
- Karl?
- Yes.

605
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:33,992
You mean that Karl and Anna...?

606
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,780
Karl?

607
00:35:38,993 --> 00:35:41,318
Well, I'm happy for him.

608
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:45,800
Anna is a very pretty girl.

609
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:47,749
A charm.

610
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,771
You look like the
night we got married.

611
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,467
Nicky?

612
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:54,325
Remember what the doctor said.

613
00:35:54,504 --> 00:35:55,893
You're right.

614
00:35:55,894 --> 00:35:57,340
I must be careful.

615
00:35:57,774 --> 00:35:59,481
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

616
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:14,612
Oh, Albert.

617
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:18,190
Yes ma'am?

618
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:19,378
Albert...

619
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:22,029
as the Baron is not going
to leave you under suspicion,

620
00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:27,247
It could be a good idea for you...
Well, put the house in order.

621
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:29,450
Yes ma'am.

622
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:31,820
Some of the servants like...
Let me think...

623
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:34,439
Hans, Liezel...

624
00:36:35,704 --> 00:36:37,073
And Karl.

625
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:43,069
You may want to
make some changes.

626
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,999
Use your own criteria.

627
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,443
Thank Mrs.

628
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,329
Something else, ma'am?

629
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:55,392
That is all.

630
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,024
Good evening, Albert.

631
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,234
What's up with everything?

632
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,423
Half of my team is not here.

633
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:09,096
No no no!
I knew he was not here!

634
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:10,218
Albert!

635
00:37:12,214 --> 00:37:14,431
Where were you, Albert?
I was calling you.

636
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,190
I'm sorry Mr.

637
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,664
Did not I tell you to make
sure you brought my troll rod?

638
00:37:17,665 --> 00:37:19,013
Is not he in his cabin, sir?

639
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:20,926
But hey, why did not anyone tell me!

640
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:22,945
Good good.
What are we waiting for?

641
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:24,298
I can not be here all day.

642
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:25,484
Well sir.

643
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,737
I have taken out your things, Lord.

644
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,064
My wool socks?

645
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:30,683
Yes, and his flannel briefs.

646
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:31,734
Well done, Albert.

647
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:33,201
Then I will disembark.

648
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:35,176
What? Land? For what?

649
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,597
Because I understood that you
would not need me, Lord.

650
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,349
The Baroness said...

651
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,940
Silly stuff! Of course it comes.

652
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,394
Eloise, what's that about
Albert not coming?

653
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:46,206
I do not...
I thought you did not need him.

654
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,791
And there is a lot to do at home.

655
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:48,949
It is not necessary?

656
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:52,440
Do you realize that we will be
out in the open for three days?

657
00:37:52,614 --> 00:37:54,909
How do you think I could
live without Albert?

658
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,438
What happens?

659
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,877
Karl and Anna.

660
00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,370
What? What?

661
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,256
Oh nothing.

662
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:03,378
Then very well.

663
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:05,780
Good, Captain. Clearance!

664
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:11,848
Goodbye, Albert.

665
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:13,059
Karl.

666
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,172
I have to tell you something.

667
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,282
What's up, Albert?

668
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:18,072
You know what happens.

669
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,752
And it's going to end.
You understand?

670
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:21,182
End up? What is going to end?

671
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:22,631
I'm a patient man, Karl...

672
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:24,491
but I've had enough
of your impudence.

673
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,500
Do you hear me?

674
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:27,657
Stay away from my house.

675
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:29,612
And do not talk to my wife.

676
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,687
Do not talk to Anna?

677
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:32,767
What will she say?

678
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,917
It does not matter.

679
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:35,294
You're going to leave her
alone once and for all.

680
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:36,697
What's going on here?

681
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:38,193
Why do not you disembark, Karl?

682
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:39,555
Albert wants to talk to me, Lord.

683
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:40,579
A few last minute instructions.

684
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,725
What a moment for that!

685
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:43,042
Go Go! Get off the boat.

686
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:43,653
Yes sir.

687
00:38:43,683 --> 00:38:45,443
All right, Captain. Clearance!

688
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,737
Well sir.

689
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,526
See you later, Albert.

690
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,865
Are you sure Albert agreed?

691
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:24,363
After dinner. Clear.

692
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:28,861
Do not you remember that he made me come
back just as I was getting off the ship?

693
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:31,138
That's what we were talking about.

694
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,666
I wonder why he stayed.

695
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,490
He said he was not with them.

696
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:36,410
Well, I did not expect to do it.

697
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,907
That's why I wanted to be sure you
were going to have a good friend.

698
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:41,613
Albert is so considerate.

699
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,903
Hey, you do not have to tell
me what a good guy Albert is;

700
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,914
Not after how he has treated me.

701
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,485
Well, good old Albert!

702
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:01,643
I feel great.

703
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,096
So warm in here.

704
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:06,879
I wonder what makes me
feel so warm in here.

705
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,527
It could be wine, right?

706
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:10,578
Do not.

707
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:13,260
I thought it was
wine, to drink it.

708
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:15,161
Of that nothing.

709
00:40:18,098 --> 00:40:20,071
Oh, his feet are wet.

710
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:22,665
Poor Albert.

711
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,995
Albert?

712
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:25,973
Clear.
Look at his pretty sideburns.

713
00:40:28,395 --> 00:40:30,514
Come on. Come on.

714
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,965
They tickle, right?

715
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:34,606
What tickles?

716
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,690
The whiskers of Albert.

717
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:43,992
Oh, poor Albert.

718
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,343
Albert abandons you.

719
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:51,842
Hey, an old love mess.

720
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,587
And also family.

721
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,479
In your husband's lap.

722
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:03,964
What's happening to me?

723
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,225
Behaving like this!

724
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:07,086
I do not know what I was laughing at.

725
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,437
Excuse me.

726
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:03,858
Goodnight.

727
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:07,955
Do not.

728
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,163
I know where you like to be kissed.

729
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,379
What do you mean?

730
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,269
It is marked by a charming little moon.

731
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:15,458
It's like a drop of chocolate.

732
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,099
Did Albert never tell you
how beautiful it was?

733
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,494
Albert never looks at
the back of my neck.

734
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:24,706
Not even to see if it was clean?

735
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,722
Oh do not worry.

736
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,843
I'll turn it off right away.

737
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:40,778
What a disappointment.

738
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:42,791
Hala, that's it. Look.

739
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:45,053
Ea, ready.

740
00:42:45,054 --> 00:42:46,288
The fire is already off.

741
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,048
I know. But...

742
00:42:51,074 --> 00:42:53,419
Your room is ready
for when you like.

743
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,102
What are you talking about?
I have not asked for any room.

744
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:58,048
Oh, yes, Lord.

745
00:42:58,091 --> 00:42:59,087
Everything as he said.

746
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:00,602
Wine and a fire.

747
00:43:00,603 --> 00:43:02,668
And a nice surprise for the lady.

748
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,317
Anna, please.

749
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,373
But it was for you, Lord.

750
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:08,008
Do not you remember the money?

751
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:09,920
Oh, money, huh?
Is that what you want?

752
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,943
But, Lord, you...

753
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:12,715
What is happening, Lord?

754
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:14,831
This man made a mistake.

755
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:16,645
Which unfortunately
concerns this lady...

756
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:18,721
for which I have
the deepest respect.

757
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:21,303
Take.

758
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:23,642
The next time you want money,
try to earn it honestly.

759
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:24,697
Thank my Lord.

760
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,041
Thank my Lord.

761
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:43,577
I do not give you any pity.

762
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:46,653
I could have died by your side,
with so many attentions.

763
00:43:48,314 --> 00:43:50,283
Does it hurt a lot, Nicky?

764
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:52,801
It starts giving me pangs.
That's bad.

765
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:55,731
After all the plans I
made for this trip,

766
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,452
Who would have thought this would happen?

767
00:43:57,453 --> 00:44:00,362
Well, what do you expect
from a fishing trip?

768
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:04,801
It's a miracle you did not
take the bait before.

769
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:08,810
Albert.

770
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,975
Are you sure the hook was new?

771
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:13,283
Yes sir. All were.

772
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:19,581
<i>I carry you in my heart</i>

773
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:23,147
<i>I take you in thought.</i>

774
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:26,905
<i>You make me suffer a lot.</i>

775
00:44:26,906 --> 00:44:29,803
<i>You do not know how good I am for you.</i>

776
00:44:29,804 --> 00:44:34,470
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

777
00:44:59,203 --> 00:45:00,562
Why you do not believe me?
It was a mistake.

778
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:01,902
Believe you?
I do not believe anything about you.

779
00:45:01,903 --> 00:45:03,404
I have never felt so
ashamed in my whole life.

780
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:05,293
I did not even think I
was that kind of girl.

781
00:45:05,294 --> 00:45:06,618
Wait until Albert...!

782
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:09,435
I do not think Albert
said you would take me.

783
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:11,770
He did not say. He did not say.
You know he did not say it!

784
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:13,623
You also lied about that.

785
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,343
Shut up.

786
00:45:18,522 --> 00:45:20,271
You will awaken the whole world.

787
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:21,455
What will they think?

788
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:23,013
You lied to me about Albert.

789
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,229
According to you, he
said he could go, right?

790
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,464
What am I going to do now?

791
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:27,897
What will I do when he finds out?

792
00:45:27,898 --> 00:45:28,897
He does not need to know.

793
00:45:28,898 --> 00:45:30,187
You do not have to tell him.

794
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,299
So you did it?

795
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,815
And now you want me to lie to you?

796
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,649
I've never lied to
Albert in all my life!

797
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,624
And now you want me to do it!

798
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,420
Listen, Anna.

799
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,554
I have to tell you the truth.

800
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:50,777
I have done everything you said.

801
00:45:51,412 --> 00:45:52,568
All.

802
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:54,683
I cheated on you...

803
00:45:54,826 --> 00:45:56,255
and I lied to you...

804
00:45:57,164 --> 00:45:59,451
because I'm crazy about you.

805
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,801
I have done everything
in order to be with you.

806
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:05,558
But now I will go.

807
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:09,728
Nothing you can say
will be enough.

808
00:46:17,919 --> 00:46:19,892
Do not you think to talk to me?

809
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:22,835
Well, I deserve it too.

810
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:25,989
Listen, Anna.

811
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,082
I have never had many opportunities;

812
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,709
I have never had anyone to
show me the right path.

813
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:39,571
I have had to fight alone in life.

814
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:42,167
Bad companies.

815
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:46,246
Never before have I been in
love with someone good...

816
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:48,359
like you.

817
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,424
I did not know how to treat you.

818
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:56,332
Well, now it's too late.

819
00:46:58,067 --> 00:46:59,538
Goodbye, Anna.

820
00:47:00,648 --> 00:47:01,914
Goodbye?

821
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,518
I leave.

822
00:47:05,545 --> 00:47:08,038
I can not stay after
what I've done.

823
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,619
I'm so embarrassed that...

824
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,239
I could not look
you in the face again.

825
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,796
But... but your job.

826
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,466
I do not want you to lose it.

827
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:15,626
It does not matter.

828
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:17,159
I'll find another one.

829
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,048
And if not, well, nobody will care.

830
00:47:21,548 --> 00:47:23,606
Do not worry about me.

831
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:25,256
I'm not worth it

832
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,414
Anna.

833
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,585
Before I leave...

834
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:41,813
You want...?

835
00:47:44,672 --> 00:47:45,690
Could you...

836
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:50,263
kiss me goodbye?

837
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,348
Come on. Come on. Open the door!

838
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,578
Why does not someone do something?

839
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,224
I'll call Dr. Stirs.

840
00:48:43,225 --> 00:48:44,944
Someone prepare my bed.

841
00:48:44,945 --> 00:48:46,062
Albert.

842
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:47,059
Yes sir?

843
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,800
Are you sure the hook was new?

844
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:49,867
In all, Lord.

845
00:49:06,961 --> 00:49:08,408
Hi, Albert.

846
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:10,745
How did you get back?

847
00:49:10,746 --> 00:49:12,476
We rent a car.

848
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:14,706
What are you doing here?

849
00:49:14,899 --> 00:49:16,721
I was going to wash the car.

850
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:19,187
Good morning, Anna.

851
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:21,467
You came back early, Albert.

852
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:23,232
Yes.

853
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:27,467
Karl gave you good morning, Anna.

854
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:30,285
- Good morning, Karl.
- Good Morning.

855
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:32,067
What time did you come back last night?

856
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:33,606
Oh I do not know.
It was not too late.

857
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:35,070
What time, Anna?

858
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:38,376
At that... nine o'clock, I think.

859
00:49:39,317 --> 00:49:40,678
Look at that button.

860
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:43,165
What does that mean?
With this aspect!

861
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,046
I am sorry. I did not see it.
I'll fix it.

862
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:49,092
I will not tolerate such
neglected habits in this house.

863
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:51,153
I already had more than enough.

864
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,291
You can collect your payment.

865
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,642
Charge my...?

866
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:55,658
I am fired?

867
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:56,851
Yes!

868
00:49:56,986 --> 00:49:58,233
For a loose button?

869
00:49:58,234 --> 00:49:59,957
I will not talk about it.

870
00:50:02,736 --> 00:50:04,769
Did the Baroness complain about me?

871
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,384
That has nothing to do with this.

872
00:50:06,385 --> 00:50:08,471
I am responsible for the
servants of this house.

873
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,005
It is understood?

874
00:50:11,852 --> 00:50:13,406
Yes, understood, Albert.

875
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,068
How was the music last night?

876
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:25,279
Music?

877
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:27,385
What do you mean?

878
00:50:28,683 --> 00:50:30,860
There was a concert from Vienna.

879
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:32,145
Gypsy music.

880
00:50:32,158 --> 00:50:33,378
On the radio.

881
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:37,182
I did not turn on the radio.

882
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,537
I thought you would.

883
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:45,798
There was not much more to do.

884
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:50,918
Anna.

885
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:53,987
Is it all you have to tell me?

886
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:58,332
Yes, Albert.

887
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:01,913
I'd better go see the Baroness.

888
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:02,938
Do not!

889
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:06,030
You're not going to see the
Baroness with that look.

890
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,151
You are not wearing
the cap or the apron.

891
00:51:08,677 --> 00:51:10,478
What do you think the Baroness will say?

892
00:51:10,795 --> 00:51:11,834
Sorry. I...

893
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,290
Go fix it right away.

894
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,733
You know what I expect from
a servant in this house.

895
00:51:19,796 --> 00:51:20,509
A servant?

896
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,007
You already heard what I said.

897
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,885
Albert.

898
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:59,233
I was not sincere a moment ago.

899
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:00,539
And where have you been?

900
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,076
Where you come from?

901
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,418
Of the coffee.

902
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:05,559
He told me you asked
him to take me there.

903
00:52:05,785 --> 00:52:07,254
We drank a lot of wine.

904
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:08,520
We stay until very late.

905
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:10,471
Yes, you drank a lot of wine...

906
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,563
and you allowed him
to make love to you.

907
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:13,961
I'm sorry, Albert.

908
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:15,870
More than I can tell you.

909
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:17,467
Stop lying about it!

910
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,325
Put on your clothes!
You have work to do.

911
00:52:20,326 --> 00:52:21,638
Wait a minute.

912
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,283
I do not deserve you to
give me orders that way.

913
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:26,402
For the first time in
my life I discovered...

914
00:52:26,742 --> 00:52:28,103
for the first time...

915
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:30,701
that there are more than two
kinds of feelings in the world.

916
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:32,000
It is my fault?

917
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:35,825
A way of making love that
makes you lose your head!

918
00:52:35,826 --> 00:52:37,466
So you do not know
what you are doing.

919
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,021
Are you going to throw me out on the
street because I never felt that before?

920
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:41,691
Let's leave this conversation.

921
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:43,234
Enough now!

922
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:46,199
You learn something vile about a rat...

923
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:48,428
and you forget that you are my wife...

924
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:49,478
and that I love you.

925
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:50,500
And you bring him here.

926
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,501
It's okay.

927
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:53,594
You, honest man.

928
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:55,875
I will leave this conversation.

929
00:52:56,262 --> 00:52:58,229
Create exactly what you want to believe.

930
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,398
But listen...

931
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,733
whatever happens,
it's partly your fault.

932
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:02,954
Partly.

933
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:03,947
You think you can make love

934
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:06,034
in the same cold way you
do everything else;

935
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:08,276
You think that's
all I should want.

936
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:10,417
Well, now I tell you
frankly and plainly.

937
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,203
It's nothing like that.

938
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:13,675
It was not my intention.

939
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:15,916
The only thing I want
in my home is you.

940
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:20,045
But if you are going to be so straight,
so perfect and so implacable,

941
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:21,611
then I can not have it.

942
00:53:21,854 --> 00:53:24,503
And I thank heaven for having found
that there is something else;

943
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,013
Something that makes you feel so excited...

944
00:53:26,014 --> 00:53:28,069
you do not know what
happened and you do not care.

945
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,369
Now, continue with yours
and believe what you want.

946
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:39,379
Do you realize that this is blackmail?

947
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:43,133
That is the word I was
trying to remember.

948
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:49,119
But in reality it is not, Madam.

949
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:54,773
The simple desire to stay longer in
the service of such a lovely lady.

950
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,363
I'm sorry to present the
matter to you in this way...

951
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,831
but that's what
happens to the servants.

952
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:03,145
Sometimes our duties
are not pleasant.

953
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:06,652
Are you sure you do not accept money?

954
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:10,002
Well... not at the moment.

955
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:14,474
All I want is to remain
at your service...

956
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,601
to carry out my plans.

957
00:54:18,716 --> 00:54:20,775
Will the Lady order it to Albert?

958
00:54:35,268 --> 00:54:36,461
Sophie.

959
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,895
I heard you I heard you!

960
00:54:39,082 --> 00:54:43,206
Apparently I can not be absent for a single
night without everything falling apart.

961
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:44,751
Do you say it for me?

962
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:47,057
Did someone complain about
not having enough food?

963
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:50,110
I wanted to imply that I expect
discipline in this house.

964
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,485
Discipline? Ha!

965
00:54:51,948 --> 00:54:54,088
You talk so much about
order in this house...

966
00:54:54,274 --> 00:54:56,475
And why do not you put some
order in your own home?

967
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,666
What do you mean?

968
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:03,492
Ask your precious
Anna what I mean;

969
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:06,043
Ask her what is going on
between her and Karl.

970
00:55:06,328 --> 00:55:08,301
Of course I can be wrong.

971
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:12,078
Maybe it was not Anna who returned
with Karl at five in the morning.

972
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:13,013
Do not. Stop!

973
00:55:13,014 --> 00:55:14,795
Well, of course, if
you're not interested...

974
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:18,177
I'm not interested in anything you
have to tell me about my wife.

975
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:19,806
Anna is a good girl...

976
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,571
and a good wife.

977
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,997
And Karl is finished.

978
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,577
I've fired him.

979
00:55:26,117 --> 00:55:27,785
Leave this house.

980
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:29,542
Really?

981
00:55:29,961 --> 00:55:31,036
Does Karl leave us?

982
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,552
Yes. I said goodbye.

983
00:55:32,553 --> 00:55:35,261
Like I'll fire
anyone so insolent.

984
00:55:35,774 --> 00:55:37,196
Can you hear me?

985
00:55:37,609 --> 00:55:38,696
Albert.

986
00:55:40,335 --> 00:55:41,503
Yes ma'am?

987
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,256
Karl tells me you've fired him.

988
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,295
Yes ma'am.

989
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:48,799
I... I find Karl to my
complete satisfaction.

990
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,673
But Madam...

991
00:55:50,674 --> 00:55:52,149
I want him to stay.

992
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,212
But...

993
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,348
After all, Karl is my driver.

994
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,544
And you do not have the power to fire him.

995
00:55:58,096 --> 00:56:01,402
But Madam, I was always
responsible for the servants...

996
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,430
I do not want to talk about it anymore.

997
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,882
So you fired him, huh?

998
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:18,723
Orders, Albert?

999
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:20,057
Do not.

1000
00:56:21,517 --> 00:56:23,437
Well, if you think of any,
let me know, will you?

1001
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,305
Go back to work!

1002
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:29,114
There is so much to do
without having to flutter.

1003
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:32,263
Queen Sophie.

1004
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:34,917
A word from you and everyone jumps, huh?

1005
00:56:35,373 --> 00:56:39,183
What were you doing, hanging
out at home with Anna at dawn?

1006
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:42,057
Ha! So you also jump.

1007
00:56:43,272 --> 00:56:44,973
Do you think someone else saw us?

1008
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,361
Listen, Sophie, what a good time I spent.

1009
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:50,428
On the way home from the
boat, nothing to do.

1010
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,224
But she had to stop somewhere to
buy something to eat and drink.

1011
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:56,056
We argued because I did not
think Albert liked it.

1012
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:58,539
Well, in the end I gave up.

1013
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:01,700
You talk about those discreet
and quiet girls, huh?

1014
00:57:01,997 --> 00:57:03,863
After drinking a few extra glasses,

1015
00:57:04,779 --> 00:57:07,202
The only thing that saved me was
that they closed the place.

1016
00:57:07,203 --> 00:57:09,583
He was happy to have brought
her safe and sound.

1017
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:10,643
Wow!

1018
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:14,163
You tell it very well.

1019
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,583
Almost as well as you tell the story

1020
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:19,713
from the cafeteria that you are
going to buy me in Vienna...

1021
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:21,518
with my money!

1022
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:22,756
Is that what you want.

1023
00:57:22,757 --> 00:57:24,029
My money.

1024
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:27,476
"You should not work so hard, Sophie."

1025
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:30,907
"What you should be opening
your own business..."

1026
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:33,859
"with a man like
me to help you."

1027
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,524
My savings.

1028
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:40,930
Everything I have in these
35 years of hard work.

1029
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:43,097
Since I was 9 years old.

1030
00:57:43,506 --> 00:57:47,301
And all this time you were
with that fresh maid.

1031
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:48,335
Laughing at me.

1032
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:50,173
Laughing both of me.

1033
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:54,391
I should have imagined
that you did not love me.

1034
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:56,976
Okay, I do not love you.

1035
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:58,265
Satisfied?

1036
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,743
Oh, Karl!

1037
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:02,762
"Oh, Karl!" Do you hear?
Complaints, complaints, complaints.

1038
00:58:02,998 --> 00:58:05,638
If there's something I detest, it's
the women who are harassing me.

1039
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:07,755
You should be very grateful.

1040
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:10,198
I've spent a lot of time
and a lot of attention.

1041
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,669
And how much has it cost you?
Nothing!

1042
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:14,322
¿Costarme?

1043
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:15,946
Yes, cost you.

1044
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:19,200
With a face like that, you
should have paid, and a lot!

1045
00:58:20,903 --> 00:58:22,880
Goodbye, grandma.

1046
00:58:27,524 --> 00:58:30,184
No ma'am.
I could not, I could not do it.

1047
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:33,089
There is no room in this
house for Karl and me.

1048
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,487
Albert, please.

1049
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:39,016
This house needs you
now more than ever.

1050
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:40,733
I need you!

1051
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:44,666
I can not fire him.

1052
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:46,947
He forces me to keep him.

1053
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,873
Obligated?

1054
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,813
I do not get it.

1055
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,408
Karl is blackmailing me.

1056
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,216
Oh, Madam!

1057
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,598
I should have told him.

1058
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,556
Oh, that liar, that blackmailer!

1059
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:05,672
What kind of history has
he invented about you?

1060
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:08,265
He has not invented any history.

1061
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:10,460
It is something that knows.

1062
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,709
About you?

1063
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:14,588
Ma'am, that's ridiculous.

1064
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,853
Well, the police will clarify it with him.

1065
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,110
Police?

1066
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,632
Oh, no, no!
Albert, we can not do that!

1067
00:59:22,496 --> 00:59:24,094
Do not you realize?

1068
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:29,267
What he knows about me is true.

1069
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:33,092
I do not dare let him go.

1070
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:42,870
You have to find another
way to fix this with Karl.

1071
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,115
Sorry Mrs.

1072
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:49,211
I was wrong to think about my pride.

1073
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,581
There are other things to protect.

1074
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:53,063
You must be careful.

1075
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:56,080
A man like that is dangerous.

1076
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:58,455
I told you, Ma'am.

1077
00:59:58,456 --> 01:00:01,522
I have always been responsible
for the servants of this house.

1078
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:04,151
I am still responsible.

1079
01:00:05,864 --> 01:00:07,691
And now, if I may...

1080
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:09,441
Albert.

1081
01:00:11,683 --> 01:00:13,235
About Anna...

1082
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:15,879
She is young.

1083
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:19,140
It's not made for a guy like Karl.

1084
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,701
You must be patient with her.

1085
01:00:26,117 --> 01:00:29,029
Women sometimes do nonsense.

1086
01:00:29,899 --> 01:00:32,413
Only because of ignorance.

1087
01:00:34,276 --> 01:00:35,460
Yes.

1088
01:00:35,996 --> 01:00:37,583
Now I see it.

1089
01:02:25,377 --> 01:02:26,383
Between.

1090
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:31,794
Well thats what you want?

1091
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:37,199
I'm so miserable.

1092
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:40,872
You have not talked to me;

1093
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:42,812
You have not even looked at me.

1094
01:02:42,813 --> 01:02:43,606
Not since...

1095
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:44,844
Not since you insulted me.

1096
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,136
Oh, Karl! I did not mean that.

1097
01:02:47,425 --> 01:02:50,047
I can not stand it, if
you do not talk to me.

1098
01:02:50,048 --> 01:02:51,717
I do not care what you have done.

1099
01:02:52,296 --> 01:02:53,345
It's okay.

1100
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,164
Do not you care what he has done?

1101
01:02:55,165 --> 01:02:56,038
What have I done?

1102
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,164
I mean you and Anna.

1103
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:01,457
You will not start with that again!

1104
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:04,126
More suspicions, more
insults, more reproaches.

1105
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:07,097
Please, Karl, let's not fight.

1106
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:09,592
I can not live without you.

1107
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:12,063
I will do anything.

1108
01:03:13,462 --> 01:03:16,225
If you let me stay here with you.

1109
01:03:18,246 --> 01:03:21,278
For a few days, I would be so happy.

1110
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:23,287
Karl.

1111
01:03:23,535 --> 01:03:25,304
Karl, let's do what we said.

1112
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:27,644
Buy a cafeteria.

1113
01:03:28,521 --> 01:03:29,961
With your money?

1114
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,827
It's what you said before.

1115
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:32,949
Throwing it in my face!

1116
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,390
You think I'm going to give you
another chance to do it again.

1117
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:37,814
I'm not a sentimental fool.

1118
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:40,158
It's our money, Karl.

1119
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,654
Look.

1120
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:43,567
Here it is! All!

1121
01:03:45,275 --> 01:03:47,235
Do you know what is the
saddest thing of all this?

1122
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:48,915
Just one day before,

1123
01:03:49,308 --> 01:03:50,484
I went all over Vienna...

1124
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:52,405
looking for the right
coffee shop to buy it.

1125
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:55,018
Wandering in the sun.

1126
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:57,137
Did not you have the car?

1127
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:01,431
Do you think I would use the Baron's
car for my personal affairs?

1128
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:03,878
And I found a beauty.

1129
01:04:04,948 --> 01:04:07,010
Black marble tables.

1130
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:09,822
Red plush furniture,
golden mirrors.

1131
01:04:09,942 --> 01:04:12,121
It was the most beautiful cafe in Vienna.

1132
01:04:12,955 --> 01:04:14,754
We could make a fortune.

1133
01:04:14,755 --> 01:04:16,467
Here it is, Karl.

1134
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,911
Sophie, you offend me.

1135
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:26,888
Thinking of money right now.

1136
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,654
<i>DOMESTIC HOUSES.</i>

1137
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:36,689
<i>For hunting the boar</i>

1138
01:04:36,817 --> 01:04:40,955
<i>47 horses ready at dawn
Hunting lunch for 50 guests.</i>

1139
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:44,437
Hurry with those pigeons.

1140
01:04:47,908 --> 01:04:49,348
These lobsters are ready.

1141
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:51,118
Better send them up.

1142
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,904
Hey, what's up with that oven?

1143
01:04:56,289 --> 01:04:57,526
And Anna...

1144
01:04:57,528 --> 01:05:00,335
tell Otto to take three
bottles of Brandy Napoleon.

1145
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:04,258
It does not have the necessary height.

1146
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:05,626
It is four inches tall.

1147
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:06,669
It does not have the necessary height.

1148
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,000
Why do you say that?

1149
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:09,967
It's not high enough for this house.

1150
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:12,665
I've been working in
this house for 20 years.

1151
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:17,963
Hey, do you want to shut up, you parrots?!

1152
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:21,063
44... 46... 48... 50.

1153
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:22,064
Shut up!

1154
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:25,508
56... 58...

1155
01:05:25,646 --> 01:05:28,576
60... 65... 100.

1156
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:55,828
What time is the fastest
train to Paris?

1157
01:07:06,488 --> 01:07:07,488
Otto.

1158
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:13,490
Three bottles of Napoleon Brandy.

1159
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:15,666
What?

1160
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:19,415
Three bottles of Napoleon
Brandy, up here.

1161
01:07:25,368 --> 01:07:25,868
Anna

1162
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,777
I've been looking for
you all over the house.

1163
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:29,655
Karl, let me go. I'm scared.

1164
01:07:29,656 --> 01:07:30,991
Oh, well, it's normal that you're scared.

1165
01:07:30,992 --> 01:07:32,378
You do not have to come down.

1166
01:07:32,379 --> 01:07:33,391
Look, charm.

1167
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:34,751
I have not forgotten you.

1168
01:07:34,752 --> 01:07:36,767
I was just waiting for
my plans to be ready.

1169
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:39,008
There is a train leaving
Vienna in one hour.

1170
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:40,016
Think about it.

1171
01:07:40,017 --> 01:07:41,399
Karl! Karl, please!

1172
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,860
I love Albert.

1173
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:44,882
It's a bit late for you to
think about that, right?

1174
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:46,464
Let's finish with this nonsense.

1175
01:07:46,863 --> 01:07:48,711
We are crazy for each other.

1176
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:49,518
And you know.

1177
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:50,875
Let's go somewhere...

1178
01:07:50,876 --> 01:07:52,662
before you have the
chance to tell him.

1179
01:07:52,663 --> 01:07:54,498
You love Me. You love Me!

1180
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:55,565
No no. Karl.

1181
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,858
All I want is my
husband and my job.

1182
01:07:57,859 --> 01:07:59,339
Let me go, please!

1183
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,539
Listen out.

1184
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,079
Are you going to do what
I say and come with me?

1185
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,835
Or are you going to be
around until you get kicked?

1186
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:05,655
Please, have a little mercy.

1187
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,808
Piety? I tell you...

1188
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,051
I love you.

1189
01:08:10,259 --> 01:08:11,725
Listen, Anna...

1190
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:13,477
I have much money to spend.

1191
01:08:13,478 --> 01:08:15,121
We will spend like kings.

1192
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:17,080
I'm going to make you happy.

1193
01:08:17,081 --> 01:08:18,243
It's Sophie's money.

1194
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:20,255
And what else does it give you?
I'm going to spend it with you.

1195
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:21,926
- Spending Sophie's money with me?
- Yes.

1196
01:08:21,927 --> 01:08:23,953
No, I will not go with you!
I will not go!

1197
01:08:23,954 --> 01:08:24,954
Oh, listen!

1198
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,058
I will leave you here for
nothing in the world.

1199
01:08:27,063 --> 01:08:28,315
You are welcome!

1200
01:08:28,316 --> 01:08:30,364
Besides, how do you know Albert
wants you to stay here...

1201
01:08:30,365 --> 01:08:31,832
once you know what's ours?

1202
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,456
And he will know because I will tell him!

1203
01:08:33,457 --> 01:08:35,008
- Oh no!
- Oh yeah!

1204
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:37,025
And to each inhabitant of this house.

1205
01:08:37,544 --> 01:08:39,758
If Albert does not have
arrests to forgive you,

1206
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,838
the others will make your life impossible.

1207
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,516
You will not be able to
continue living here!

1208
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:45,200
Let go of me, you filthy beast!

1209
01:08:45,764 --> 01:08:47,465
So you do not want to leave, huh?

1210
01:08:47,466 --> 01:08:48,907
All right, then
I'll tell Albert!

1211
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:51,200
I'll tell him and he'll kick you out!

1212
01:08:51,446 --> 01:08:53,514
Come here! Come here!
Give me that!

1213
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:55,906
Give me that!

1214
01:08:55,977 --> 01:08:57,280
Do not!

1215
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,492
I'll see what happens.

1216
01:09:26,991 --> 01:09:27,963
Albert, I'm sorry.

1217
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,999
The barrel slid and
hit the wine rack.

1218
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:32,013
As a...

1219
01:09:32,153 --> 01:09:33,346
Albert!

1220
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:35,498
Albert!

1221
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,510
Do not!

1222
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:38,184
Albert!

1223
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:44,027
I'm sorry Mr.

1224
01:09:44,454 --> 01:09:48,127
But many of its best
bottles have been broken.

1225
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:49,738
I lost my head.

1226
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:52,470
The spilled wine is not
as important as this.

1227
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:55,057
Yes sir. I am sorry.

1228
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,851
Go back to work
and fix the mess.

1229
01:09:56,852 --> 01:09:58,071
I do not want to know anything
else about the matter.

1230
01:09:58,072 --> 01:09:59,308
Yes sir.

1231
01:10:02,877 --> 01:10:04,841
You, go back to work!

1232
01:10:05,148 --> 01:10:06,851
And help clean the cellar.

1233
01:10:19,134 --> 01:10:21,076
Leave this place clean.

1234
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:29,399
Liebfrauenmilch!

1235
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:38,324
Well, Karl.

1236
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:40,566
I think I rushed.

1237
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:49,175
Anna, it's better to go
up and change clothes.

1238
01:10:49,617 --> 01:10:51,050
And Franz...

1239
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:52,520
you and Ernst go back to the kitchen.

1240
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:54,149
We will finish this tomorrow.

1241
01:10:56,372 --> 01:10:58,306
No, Karl, do not go.

1242
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:00,191
You are still nervous.

1243
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,680
I'm sorry, I lost my composure.

1244
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,529
It is not the way to fix things.

1245
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:08,586
Better take something.

1246
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,845
Clear.

1247
01:11:15,386 --> 01:11:16,865
Here is one that is not broken.

1248
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:20,330
Intact, Karl.

1249
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:23,328
But affected.

1250
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:26,920
The wine is like that.

1251
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,832
Easily alterable.

1252
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:30,602
Like a woman.

1253
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:38,056
And when she's upset, she
needs time to calm down.

1254
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:43,232
Time for the grounds to
return to the bottom.

1255
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:54,711
With some care, time and rest,
you will get well again.

1256
01:11:55,551 --> 01:11:58,102
But you must take care of the wine.

1257
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,227
And of women.

1258
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:05,805
Otto, stay in the care of wine.

1259
01:12:06,998 --> 01:12:08,247
And of the women...?

1260
01:12:09,445 --> 01:12:10,540
Good...

1261
01:12:11,813 --> 01:12:13,501
It is a work of men.

1262
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:16,316
Take care of them.

1263
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,803
A few glasses, Otto.

1264
01:12:21,825 --> 01:12:23,425
I'm sorry about what happened, Albert.

1265
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:26,955
I imagine it's too late to
cry for the spilled wine.

1266
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:29,505
It is done.

1267
01:12:30,645 --> 01:12:32,408
Let's have a drink, huh?

1268
01:12:33,568 --> 01:12:35,020
Oh no.

1269
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,331
We will provide something special.

1270
01:12:39,111 --> 01:12:40,550
I will bring a bottle.

1271
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:56,124
Hey, I do not want wine.

1272
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:58,255
Blind?

1273
01:12:58,256 --> 01:13:00,189
Do not. I'm not blind

1274
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:02,026
I'm just deaf

1275
01:13:02,027 --> 01:13:03,228
I do not hear.

1276
01:13:08,147 --> 01:13:09,391
Here we are.

1277
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:23,759
Well, Karl.

1278
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:25,911
For your future!

1279
01:13:27,396 --> 01:13:29,029
And no more spilled wine.

1280
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:37,536
Well, Albert, I
accepted your apology.

1281
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:38,959
I think now I should go.

1282
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,181
Yes, Karl.

1283
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,119
Ten minutes to collect
your stuff and get away!

1284
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,647
Take my hands off!

1285
01:13:45,577 --> 01:13:47,822
Now we will do it without making a fuss!

1286
01:13:48,106 --> 01:13:50,245
I could have killed you if
the Baron does not stop me.

1287
01:13:50,246 --> 01:13:52,880
Oh, save my life so you
could fire me, huh?

1288
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,365
Well, do not kid yourself, Albert.

1289
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:56,233
If you want to get out
of here in 10 minutes,

1290
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,117
You will have to work quickly.

1291
01:13:58,123 --> 01:13:59,002
Hears...

1292
01:13:59,003 --> 01:14:00,998
I will be here
as long as I want.

1293
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:02,719
And you're going to have to put up with it.

1294
01:14:02,976 --> 01:14:06,322
Out of my sight or I can not
take your hands off you.

1295
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:08,027
You're going to take my hands off me

1296
01:14:08,028 --> 01:14:10,048
because the people from
above will tell you.

1297
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:10,997
If you say goodbye again,

1298
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:12,750
I will turn you into a laughingstock again.

1299
01:14:12,798 --> 01:14:15,219
And those above will
do what I tell them.

1300
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:16,189
No, Karl!

1301
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:18,589
You will never be near the ones above.

1302
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,787
You are done.

1303
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:21,746
Leave the Baroness out of this.

1304
01:14:21,747 --> 01:14:23,350
And to Sophie, leave her alone.

1305
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,934
I have everything I need from Sophie.

1306
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:25,804
And my wife...

1307
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:27,545
You're going to save them all, right?

1308
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,975
Well, look.

1309
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:31,215
When they're over, I'll
go for the Baroness's.

1310
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:33,254
And she'll pay me until I want to.

1311
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:37,209
Filthy pig!

1312
01:14:39,097 --> 01:14:40,874
So there's no other
option with you?

1313
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:43,815
My wife can not protect herself from you?

1314
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:45,240
Come on, let's go!

1315
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:48,095
Stand up and fight, dirty rat!

1316
01:14:48,096 --> 01:14:50,011
I give you that opportunity.

1317
01:14:50,012 --> 01:14:52,793
But only one will come out on its own.

1318
01:14:52,794 --> 01:14:56,676
No, damn dog!

1319
01:15:00,219 --> 01:15:01,093
Albert!

1320
01:15:01,094 --> 01:15:02,151
Albert, stop!

1321
01:15:02,152 --> 01:15:03,418
You are killing him!

1322
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:09,199
Call the Baron!
It is killing you!

1323
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:11,844
Albert!

1324
01:15:12,043 --> 01:15:12,800
Albert!

1325
01:15:12,961 --> 01:15:14,688
Take this!

1326
01:15:14,897 --> 01:15:15,993
Albert!

1327
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,069
Come on, get up!

1328
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:23,424
Come on!

1329
01:15:30,815 --> 01:15:32,255
Quick! Quick!

1330
01:15:32,281 --> 01:15:33,342
It is killing you.

1331
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,000
Albert!

1332
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,383
For! Enough is enough!

1333
01:15:37,446 --> 01:15:38,848
I will take care of this.

1334
01:15:38,962 --> 01:15:40,951
Excuse me sir...

1335
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:42,517
but this time I will do it.

1336
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:45,250
He has something to tell you.

1337
01:15:45,526 --> 01:15:47,529
Some twisted idea.

1338
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,663
Come on, let's go!

1339
01:15:49,664 --> 01:15:51,169
Say it!

1340
01:15:51,524 --> 01:15:52,973
Nothing, Lord.

1341
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:55,110
Sophie, come here!

1342
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:58,142
Give him back the money you
stole from this woman.

1343
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,249
Come on!

1344
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:05,603
And my wife.

1345
01:16:06,165 --> 01:16:07,883
There is something pending with her.

1346
01:16:08,407 --> 01:16:09,925
Come on. Tell her!

1347
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:12,253
Say it! Come on.

1348
01:16:12,254 --> 01:16:13,142
Nothing.

1349
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:14,775
Creepy!

1350
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:16,783
Out of here!

1351
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:22,723
You loaded my grinder.

1352
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:26,389
Well done, Albert.

1353
01:16:26,684 --> 01:16:27,825
Thank my Lord.

1354
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,178
Just a little cleaning.

1355
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:32,676
Go back to work. Everybody!

1356
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:34,666
As before. Hurry!

1357
01:16:35,236 --> 01:16:36,300
Very good, Albert.

1358
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:37,471
Thank my Lord.

1359
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:40,180
What did he say, Albert?

1360
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:41,642
Nothing sweetheart.

1361
01:16:41,808 --> 01:16:43,956
Everything is well now.
Do not worry.

1362
01:16:43,957 --> 01:16:45,239
Yes sir.

1363
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,531
Did not I tell you not to call me "Sir"?

1364
01:16:48,532 --> 01:16:49,728
Yes sir.

1365
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:51,783
Well, just one more, ma'am.

1366
01:16:51,784 --> 01:16:54,989
Oh, no, no, Olly.
I will not interview more drivers today.

1367
01:16:55,196 --> 01:16:57,509
Tomorrow afternoon at three.

1368
01:17:10,753 --> 01:17:11,460
And good?

1369
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:13,026
The new chauffeur of the Lady.

1370
01:17:13,326 --> 01:17:14,349
I hope so.
