00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,331
He knows what he believes
and what he thinks is right,

152
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,709
and why, and where he's going.

153
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,963
Oh, Mom, there's one thing
I must tell you.

154
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,092
He was married before,
and he had a son.

155
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,970
It was so tragic.

156
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,226
Both his wife and son were killed in a
train accident in Belgium eight years ago.

157
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,896
And John...

158
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,357
I haven't even
told you his name.

159
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:25,906
Mom, it's John Wade Prentice.
Isn't that a lovely name?

160
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,367
John Wade...

161
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,204
JOEY: Joanna Prentice, I'll be.

162
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,542
But, Mom. Mom?

163
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,044
There's something else
that I must tell you

164
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,881
that John's been concerned
about, very deeply concerned.

165
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,176
He's been worrying for the past week
whether you and Dad would be upset if...

166

[JOHN CLEARS THROAT]

167
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,474
Well, it's about time. I was
wondering where you'd been.

168
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,687
Mom, this is John.

169
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,442
Doc... Doc... Dr. Prentice?

170
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,238
I'm so pleased to meet you.

171
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,783
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Drayton.

172
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,953
I take it Joanna's already
busted out with the big news.

173
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:17,874
Well, she has told me a good deal,
and all very quickly too.

174
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:24,381
Well, she's only known me for 10 days,
so she can't tell you when I'm blushing.

175
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,551
That could be another
problem for us.

176
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,058
Mrs. Drayton, I'm medically qualified, so
I hope you wouldn't think it presumptuous

177
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,270
if I say you ought to sit down
before you fall down.

178
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,149
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

179
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,734
Well...

180
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,821
I don't think I'm
going to faint. Ahem.

181
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,700
But I'll sit down anyway.

182
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,167
Can't we all sit down?

183
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,059
Well, I, um...

184
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,062
I suppose it would
be all right if I said,

185
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,564
"My goodness," wouldn't it?

186
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,359
Well, my goodness.

187
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,362
Do we mind her saying
"My goodness"?

188
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,655
I don't mind.

189
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,199
Did you tell them about me? Yes.

190
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,743
What'd they say?
They said I sounded serious

191
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,121
and asked if you were
pretty. I said you were.

192
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,542
They said this was a big
surprise. I said it was.

193
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,337
What did they say when you told
them I wasn't a coloured girl?

194
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,298
Well, I didn't. It felt like too
big a shock for the telephone.

195
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,706
After all, an awful lot of people are gonna
think that we're a very shocking pair.

196
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,639
Isn't that right, Mrs. Drayton?
I know what you mean.

197
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,727
Tillie's made us some
sandwiches. Let's go outside.

198
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:01,978
Yes, let's.

199
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,730
Come on, Dr. Prentice.

200
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,058
JOEY: I can explain the whole
situation in two minutes.

201
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,444
You see, John was invited to
lecture at Hawaii University.

202
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,448
And we met at this big party at the dean's,
and after the party we went for a long drive.

203
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,658
Thank you.

204
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,662
And since then, we've been somewhere together
every night. We've been swimming every day.

205
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,583
And then John was supposed to fly back to
Los Angeles on Saturday to see his parents.

206
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,210
That's where they live.

207
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,005
Thank you, Tillie.

208
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,429
Try one of these. They're great.

209
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,848
Do you want some coffee?
No. No, thanks. No coffee.

210
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,641
Does your father
know that you're back?

211
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,721
Oh, no, I was gonna phone him. Do you
think he'd come back early if I...?

212
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:46,081
Oh, he's coming back early, all right.
He's playing golf with Monsignor Ryan.

213
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,444
That's marvellous! Then he can meet John
and then we can all talk over dinner.

214
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,031
Because, you see, John has to fly to New York tonight
to see a friend of his at Columbia University.

215
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:59,703
And then tomorrow night, he's flying to Geneva to do
three months' work for the World Health Organization.

216
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:04,040
And what I intend to do is fly to Geneva
next week so that we can be married.

217
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,253
And that's the whole situation.
In a nutshell.

218
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:13,842
Except that he thinks that the fact he's a
Negro and I'm not creates a serious problem.

219
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
Does he?

220
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:19,639
I've told him 97 times that it wouldn't make the
slightest bit of difference to you or to Dad.

221
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,018
But he just wouldn't believe me.
And so that's why we're here.

222
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:28,648
And that's why he's watching you so closely right
now while he's pretending not to watch you at all.

I told her not to spring all this
on you so suddenly, but...

226
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,296
Look, if your father's coming home, you could at
least say that I'm somebody you met in Hawaii...

Oh, now, really!

But you could give him
a half-hour to adjust...

to be told, doesn't he?

Dad, I know this is sort of a shock because
it's all so sudden and unexpected.

297
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,613
And it never occurred to me that
I might fall in love with a Negro,

298
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:30,492
but I did, and nothing in the
world is gonna change that.

299
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:36,122
Even if you had any objections I wouldn't let him
go now, if you were the governor of Alabama.

300
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:40,335
I mean, if Mom were.
So tell him, will you?

301
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,755
Tell John if you have any objections,
and then you can go play golf.

302
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,675
What is it you expect me to say?

303
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,678
If you want me to think about this,
you'll have to give me time.

304
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,598
The doctor says you have
a problem. You certainly have.

305
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:58,311
And if you're expecting any sensible statement from me,
you'll have to give me a little time to think about it.

306
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,604
Does that sound reasonable?

307
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,191
It's reasonable, Mr. Drayton,
but not quite practical.

308
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:09,239
You see, Matt, there's
sort of a special problem.

309
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:14,119
See, I've got to fly to New York tonight,
and on to Switzerland tomorrow night.

310
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:19,082
Yes, and what Joey wants, what she
proposes, is to go to Geneva herself

311
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,585
so that they can be married
within the next couple of weeks.

312
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,754
What the hell is all the rush?

313
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,802
JOEY: Well, we know that
we want to get married.

314
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,635
And unless somebody does have any
objections, why should we waste any time?

315
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,680
John and I aren't gonna
change our minds.

316

Are you telling me

317
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:41,104
that you want an answer today
about how your mother and I feel?

318
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,357
Well, of course we do.
We want you and Mom to state

319
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,193
absolutely clearly that you
have no objections whatever.

320
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,822
And that when we do get married,
we'll have your blessing.

321
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,834
Now, are you gonna
play golf, or no?

322
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,627
No, no, no.

323
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,422
I'll just call it off.
Excuse me, doctor.

324
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,264
And that's my dad.
Do you like him?

325
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
I don't know. Does he like me?

326
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,851
I don't know either.

327
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,022
When he puts on his American-eagle face,
nobody can tell what he's thinking except Mom.

328
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,567
Yeah, well, I don't think he liked any
of us after the silly way we began.

329

Give John some more coffee.

330

better-looking than you, you know that?

331

Hello, Edie? Two things,
Edie, both of them urgent.

332

Call up Monsignor Ryan, make my apologies
and tell him I can't play this afternoon.

333
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,005
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

334
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:53,718
Then call the library and see if they've
got any dope on a John Wade Prentice.

335
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,556
Prentice. A doctor of medicine,
fellow of about 35, 36.

Oh, Matt! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Gee.
He's a coloured fella.

337
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:07,148
If they haven't got anything, call up the
Medical Association, see what they've got.

338
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,985
Get anything you can, will you?
Hurry it up and call me back.

339
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,404
Surely there can't be
any necessity for that.

340
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,948
It can't do any harm either.

341
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:19,744
But, Matt, for gosh sake. Joey said he was
lecturing at the university in Hawaii.

342
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,039
Tell me something, did this ever
occur to you that this might happen?

No.

Never occurred to me either.
Not once.

Well, can you tell me your reaction?
How do you feel about it?

MATT: Sure, sure, doctor.
Come on in.

356
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,711
There's something you both ought to know.
I made a decision.

357
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,636
Joanna doesn't know about it, and I
don't see any reason why she should.

358
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,925
What is it, doctor?

359
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,971
Joanna thinks she's committed
and that our whole future is settled,

360
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,890
but there is no real commitment.

361
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,644
And up to now,
nothing is settled at all.

362
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:31,274
I don't understand. Joanna said you were gonna be
married no matter what we might think about it.

363
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,110
Well, that's not the case.

364
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,781
Unless you two approve, and without any
reservations at all, there won't be any marriage.

365
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,954
Well, why, John?
Why have you decided that?

366
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:49,459
Well, Mrs. Drayton, this thing
has happened so quickly

367
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,712
I'm just as startled
as you must be.

368
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,798
Two weeks ago I would have said
such a thing was inconceivable.

369
00:27:57,051 --> 00:28:01,304
But two weeks ago
I had not met Joanna.

370
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:06,934
She's not at all like
anyone I've ever known.

371
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:11,105
It's not just that our colour
difference doesn't matter to her.

372
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:15,693
It's that she doesn't seem to
think there is any difference.

373
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:23,868
The trouble is, this thing has come up at a time
when I already have all the problems I need.

374
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:29,332
And I feel that I couldn't afford to get married if it
meant that I would have to take on any special problems

375
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,085
in addition to those we're
obviously going to have.

376
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,174
When you say "special problems,"
doctor, what do you mean?

377
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,051
Well...

Joanna is very close
to both of you.

381
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,778
If by marrying me she damaged
her relationship with either of you,

382
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,906
the pain of it
would be too much for her.

383
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,785
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

384
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:09,414
In any case,
I wouldn't even want to try.

385
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,335
Well, I'm glad you
told us this, doctor.

386
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,675
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

387
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:25,012
There is nothing I wouldn't do to try to keep
her as happy as she was the day I met her.

388
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:30,268
But it seems to me without your
approval we will make no sense at all.

I appreciate that, doctor.

It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

403

the way we brought her up to be.

404

essentially superior to the black people,

01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:11,537
and he behaved irresponsibly
by letting this thing happen.

880
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,498
Now he wants me to be
happy about a situation

get their brains knocked out!

And I know how you're reacting.

01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,594
You're so wrapped up
in Joey's excitement

01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,556
that you are not behaving
in her best interest.

tonight. You can understand, can't you, Mom?

887
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:13,075
My passport's in order, I don't need
anything. I can pack in an hour.

together the whole time.

I can see them.

Well...

I should've called you back again,
because there is one thing I...

894
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:43,147
I've been meaning to write to you.
There's one thing I didn't explain.

895
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:47,943
And I'm afraid it's gonna
be kind of a shock.

I'm very pleased to meet you.

I can explain.

903
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:24,605
I can imagine what's
going on in your mind,

904
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:28,233
but we can explain.

You can? Of course we can.

Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

What did your folks say?
All's well.

910

Did you talk with your father?
To Mom, but she'll tell him.

911

Tonight?
I thought I ought to tell you.

912
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,807
This whole damn thing...
No, that's out of the question.

913
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:05,354
I couldn't do what you're about to do, so I don't
begin to understand how you propose to go about it.

914
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:09,942
You can't break their hearts over a drink
and then expect them to sit down to dinner.

915
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,653
Don't you think I know that?

916
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:18,283
I'll talk to the doctor after dinner.
Tell him exactly how I feel.

917
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,245
Matt, I'm not trying to argue.

918
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,498
There's nothing to say
that you don't know.

919
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,043
But it's important that you understand
just how wrong I think you...

920
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,504
I believe you're making
the worst mistake...

921
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:35,134
I think you'll regret it
for as long as you live.

922
01:07:35,343 --> 01:07:38,137
You're as wrong as you can be.

923
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:42,641
I'm thinking of her. Even the doctor's
gonna know I'm thinking of her.

924
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:47,896
There's something else. I'm surprised
it hasn't occurred to you.

925
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:52,484
The doctor will accept whatever you say to
him because he's a terribly sensitive man

926
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,862
and because he said he would.

927
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:59,908
But Joey won't. Your mistake is in
underestimating your daughter.

928
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,203
She'll fight you and your whole
attitude and everything you do

929
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,372
and every argument
you ever try to give her.

930
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,083
And one thing more.

931
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:12,963
Until today I'd never have believed
I could say such a thing.

932
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:17,050
But when she fights you,
and for what it may be worth,

933
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,220
I'm going to be on her side.

I'd hear you say a thing like that.

I've seen them so surprised.

943

What really shook them was that I wanted to
marry anybody they hadn't even heard about.

if we were a little stunned too.

01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:49,151
That's your trouble. You've gone back on
yourself. In your heart, you know it.

1027
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,445
There's a limit to what
I'll take, even from you!

1028
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:57,325
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

1029
01:14:57,535 --> 01:14:59,619
You know that, Matt.

1030
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:05,083
And for the first time in all those
30 years, I feel sorry for you.

1031
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:07,294
Damn it, that's enough!

1032
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:11,089
Are you really capable of putting
yourself in my position?

1033
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:15,427
Unless you've got kids
of your own somewhere,

1034
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,681
how could you know how a father
feels in this situation?

1035
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:24,311
You don't know! I know they
won't have a dog's chance,

1036
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,606
not in this country, not in
the whole stinking world!

1037
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,399
They are this country, Matt.

1038
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,319
They'll change
this stinking world.

1039
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,363
In 50 years, maybe,
or 100 years,

1040
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:38,408
but not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

1041
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:39,826
My dear friend,

1042
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:44,039
I wish with all my heart
you could be restrained.

1043
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,627
If I were 10 years younger, to
prevent you from going downstairs,

1044
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,297
I'd make an effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

1045
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,799
That'll be the day.
That will be the day.

1046
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,052
[CAR HORN HONKING]

1047
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:01,973
Is that the car?
Did you hear a car?

1048
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,647
Mrs. Prentice.
I'm Christina Drayton.

1049
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:09,856
How do you do?

1050
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,652
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to meet you.

1051
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:18,073
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours, Mrs. Prentice?

1052
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,326
How good of you to come
all this long way. Do go in.

1053
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,287
What did Dad say? Did you tell him?
Was he shaken?

1054
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,997
Well, it was a surprise.

1055
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,290
Does he wanna talk to me?

1056
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,002
I'm sure he does, later.
Please come in.

1057
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,966
May I get you a drink?
May I have some sherry, please?

1058
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:40,387
What a lovely room.
John, would you be bartender?

1059
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,722
Shall we sit over here?

1060
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,934
What will you have, Dad? Bourbon?
Thank you.

1061
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,104
MRS. PRENTICE: You have such a
magnificent view, Mrs. Drayton.

1062
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,981
Thank you. Please sit down.

1063
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:53,692
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

1064
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,615
Did you have a pleasant flight?

1065
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,617
Very pleasant, thank you.

1066
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:06,204
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

1067
01:17:06,414 --> 01:17:09,207
Only took 40 minutes.
Four hundred miles.

1068
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,960
It's incredible, isn't it?

1069

[CLEARS THROAT]

1070
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:20,010
My husband will be down directly, I think.
He's upstairs changing.

1071
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:24,681
And we have a friend coming
to dinner, Monsignor Ryan.

1072
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:30,103
They'll be down in a minute.
Mrs. Prentice. Mom.

1073
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:32,772
Here you are, Dad. Thanks, son.

1074
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:37,944
Are you Catholics, Mrs. Drayton?

1075
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,282
No, we're not, Mr. Prentice.

1076
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:47,412
I'm afraid we're nothing in particular. Monsignor
Ryan just happens to be an old friend.

1077
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:51,082
Do you come often
to San Francisco?

1078
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:55,295
I've got to talk to your father.
There he is.

1079
01:17:56,505 --> 01:18:00,050
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

1080
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,969
This is my father.
Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

1081
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,179
How do you do?

1082
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:08,767
Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.
May I present Monsignor Ryan?

1083
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,227
How do you do? How do you do?

1084
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:12,771
Glad to meet you, sir.

1085
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:14,856
Are you and John tending bar?
Yes.

1086
01:18:15,066 --> 01:18:18,443
We're both drinking Scotch.
Coming up.

1087
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:22,781
Sit down, sit down.
Sit down there, Mike.

1088
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:25,158
Well...

1089
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,579
Did you have a nice flight
from Los Angeles?

1090
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,331
Oh, yes. Very nice flight.

1091
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,500
TOGETHER: Only 40 minutes.

1092
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,171
Only 40 minutes from Los Angeles.
Terrifying.

1093
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:41,841
If you're going to talk about flying,
you could talk about flying to Geneva,

1094
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:46,012
because John and I are hoping to persuade all
four of you to fly over for the wedding.

1095
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:49,724
Would anybody like to talk about that
before I go up and start packing?

1096
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:55,772
I take it they've told you
all about their plans.

1097
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,359
Of course we have. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

1098
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,404
I don't know about you,
Mr. Prentice,

1099
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,365
but it seems to me that these two
are rushing it just a little bit.

1100
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,743
It seemed that way to me too.

1101
01:19:09,537 --> 01:19:13,665
It seems like that to you too?
That's right.

1102
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,127
Mm-hm. I'm certainly
relieved to hear that.

1103
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:20,171
I was beginning to think
I was the only one...

1104
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:23,550
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

1105
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,052
What are you talking
about? What view?

1106
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,263
From the terrace,
before it gets too cold.

1107
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,683
Would you care to see the view?
Yes, thank you. I would.

1108
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,478
Good. Excuse us. Bring
your drink, that's fine.

1109
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:47,073
Mrs. Prentice, have you had any
chance to speak privately with John?

1110
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:49,409
Well, no.

1111
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,579
It's important you understand
what's happened here,

1112
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,957
and what I'm terribly
afraid is going to happen.

1113
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,712
May I explain the situation
to you, or try to?

1114
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,841
Yes, please. I wish you would.
First I have to ask you...

1115
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,261
Forgive my being so
abrupt and so direct.

1116
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:11,222
Are you shocked by the fact

1117
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:15,268
that John, your son,
is involved with a white girl?

1118
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,312
Yes, surprised.

1119
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,607
It never happened before.

1120
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:25,195
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

1121
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:28,656
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

1122
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:31,826
Are you, Mrs. Drayton?

1123
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:37,290
Well, I think I was at first,
this afternoon,

1124
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,460
because it came as
a surprise to us too.

1125
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,671
But now I know how
they feel about each other.

1126
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:48,259
Joey's very young, Mrs. Prentice,
but she's not a child.

1127
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:54,265
And they're deeply
in love with each other.

1128
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:02,815
Are you about to tell me that
you'd approve the marriage,

1129
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:07,111
but that your husband
won't? Is that it?

1130
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:10,448
Yes, that's it.

1131
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,992
My husband won't either.

1132
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:20,124
I wish there were more time,
just to adjust to the situation,

1133
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,546
but there just isn't any time.

1134
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,341
If we're going to accept the
thing at all, it seems to me,

1135
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,678
we'll have to trust
the two of them

1136
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:35,056
and accept that they
know what they're doing.

1137
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:40,311
And, Mrs. Drayton, my
husband just won't do that.

1138
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,946
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

1139
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:54,075
It might do no harm if we had
a few words, Mr. Drayton.

1140
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:55,326
Yes, sure.

1141
01:21:55,578 --> 01:22:00,248
We can go into my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

1142
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:07,839
Doc, you'll excuse us, please?

1143
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,929
I'll have another drink,
if you will.

1144
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:17,974
Another? No.

1145
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:23,229
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together,

1146
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,982
like for the next 10 years.

1147
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,034
Mr. Drayton...

1148
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,664
I don't know you at all, and I
certainly wouldn't wanna offend you,

1149
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:43,750
but are you some kind of a nut?

1150
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:47,086
Are you telling me
that you approve of this?

1151
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,839
I wasn't going to tell you that.

1152
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:54,052
Because if you do, you may
be a big newspaper publisher,

1153
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:58,723
and I'm nothing but a pensioned-off
mailman, but you are out of your mind!

1154
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,903
I have a good idea of what
my father is saying to him.

1155
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,529
I wish I knew.

1156
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,700
You were talking
with him upstairs.

1157
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:21,954
Have you any idea what Mr.
Drayton is saying to my father?

1158
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,248
I can tell you one thing.

1159
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:28,252
I was sorry to hear that you intend
to withdraw from the situation

1160
01:23:28,462 --> 01:23:32,090
if you encounter any opposition.

1161
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,190
She's up there packing.

1162
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:54,195
John, your mother
would like to speak to you.

1163
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:03,079
This is a mess. Where's Joey?
She's upstairs.

1164
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:05,289
I'm going up.

1165
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:10,128
Everything is ready when you are.
We're not ready, Tillie.

1166
01:24:11,839 --> 01:24:16,843
Well, what you're saying is you
feel practically the same as I do.

1167
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:22,473
That's right. But even so, you know,
this is a hell of an unhappy situation

1168
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:26,269
for both your son
and my daughter.

1169
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:30,481
I think it'd be best if you
talked to John yourself.

1170
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:32,191
Hmm.

1171
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:45,496
I said that if they didn't
approve, there'd be no marriage.

1172
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:52,003
I set the terms, Mama.
They don't disapprove.

Only Mr. Drayton. Are you sure?

1174
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:01,429
She said she'd even
drive you to the airport.

1175
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:09,145
John, I've lived with your
father for almost 40 years.

1176
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,773
God willing,
there'll be a lot more.

1177
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:19,447
And even though I've only known
about this situation for one hour,

1178
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,618
I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

1179
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,705
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

1180
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:34,045
I guess it depends upon
how much you want her.

1181
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,589
Want her?

1182
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,385
I want her, Mama.

1183
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:47,016
You know what it's been like
for me these past eight years?

1184
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:49,894
I felt like I never
wanted anybody again.

1185
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:53,940
But, Mama,

1186
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:57,068
these last few days with her,

1187
01:25:57,319 --> 01:26:01,614
it's like I'm alive again.
It's love.

1190
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:11,499
Your father wants to talk to you.
Does he?

1191
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,501
He's in my study.

1192
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,897
I've been talking to your
husband, Mrs. Prentice.

1193
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:38,067
He seems pretty much
upset by all this.

1194
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:42,655
I know. Your wife says
you are too, Mr. Drayton.

1195
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,534
Not upset, exactly. It's a
very difficult problem.

1196
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:52,164
For whom? For you
and my husband?

1197
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,501
I think you'll solve
your problem.

1198
01:26:56,128 --> 01:27:00,047
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them. That's all.

1199
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,217
And you'll have no problem.

1200
01:27:04,678 --> 01:27:07,972
You're not telling me
you're happy about this?

1201
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,768
This is not a night for
talking about happiness.

1202
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:15,021
This is an unhappy night.

1203
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:20,026
You talked to Christina.
I know how she feels.

1204
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:24,572
Can you imagine for one minute
that I want to see them hurt?

1205
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:29,660
No. No more than
my husband does.

1206
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:34,165
But hurt they're going to be,

1207
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,586
worse than my husband knows.

1208
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,839
I think worse than you know too.

1209
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:48,012
He's as much against this
as I am, maybe more.

1210
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:53,100
Son, you've got to listen. I'm not
telling you how to live your life,

1211
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,270
but you never made
a mistake like this.

1212
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,524
You've been nothing but a source of pride
for me and your mother your whole life.

1213
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,818
But you don't know
what you're doing!

1214
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:07,156
This affair happened too fast,
you said so yourself.

1215
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:12,453
You've got to stop and think! Have you
thought what people would say about you?

1216
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:16,332
In 16 or 17 states you'd be breaking
the law. You'd be criminals.

1217
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,379
And say they changed the law, that don't
change the way people feel about this thing.

1218
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:25,967
For a man who never put a wrong foot
anywhere, you're way out of line, boy!

1219
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:28,344
That's for me to decide, man.

1220
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:31,722
Shut up and let me...
Don't say that to me!

1221
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:36,644
You have no right
after what I've been to you.

1222
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:41,357
You know that and I know that.
I know what you made of yourself,

1223
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:45,152
but I worked my ass off
to buy the chances you had!

1224
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:49,490
You know how far I carried
that bag in 30 years?

1225
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:53,661
Seventy-five thousand miles.
And mowing lawns in the dark

1226
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:58,290
so you wouldn't be stoking furnaces
and could bear down on the books.

1227
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:02,962
There were things your mother should have
had that she insisted go instead for you.

1228
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:08,050
And I don't mean fancy things.
I mean a decent coat. A lousy coat!

1229
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:13,097
You'll say that means nothing?
You'll break your mother's heart?

Why do they forget everything?

1233
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:29,989
I believe those two young
people need each other

1234
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,534
like they need the air
to breathe in.

1235
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:38,122
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

1236
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,791
But you and my husband,

1237
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:44,170
you might as well be blind men.

1238
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:48,966
You can only see
that they have a problem.

1239
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:52,595
But do you really know
what's happened to them,

1240
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,514
how they feel about each other?

1241
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:00,519
I believe that men grow old,

1242
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:06,275
and when sexual things
no longer matter to them,

1243
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:11,864
they forget it all,
forget what true passion is.

1244
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:18,245
If you ever felt what my son

1245
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:25,169
feels for your daughter, you've forgotten
everything about it. My husband too.

1246
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:29,423
You knew once, but that
was a long time ago.

1247
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,258
Now the two of you don't know.

01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,598
And the strange thing
for your wife and me

01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:43,229
is that you don't even remember.

1250

If you did, how could you
do what you are doing?

1251
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:59,245
I don't care what your mother says. Maybe she's
gone haywire too. This is between you and me.

1252
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,541
That's the first thing you've said that makes any
sense, because that's exactly where it's at.

1253
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,795
And what I mean to say...
You've said what you had to say.

You listen to me.

1255

You say you don't want to
tell me how to live my life?

So, what have you been doing?

1257
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:24,061
You tell me what rights I've got or
haven't got and what I owe to you.

1258
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:30,234
Let me tell you something.
I owe you nothing.

1259
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:35,656
If you carried that bag a million miles,
you did what you were supposed to do.

1260
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:38,284
Because you brought me
into this world.

1261
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:42,329
And from that day, you owed me
everything you could ever do for me,

1262
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:47,001
like I will owe my son if I ever
have another. But you don't own me!

1263
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:51,172
You can't tell me when
or where I'm out of line,

1264
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:54,091
or make me live by your rules.

You don't even know
what I am, Dad.

You don't know who I am.
How I feel, what I think!

And if I tried to explain it the rest of
your life, you will never understand.

older than I am.

way it was for you is the way it's got to be!

And not until your whole
generation has lain down and died

of you be off our backs!

which you don't really...

1321
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,813
MATT: Christina!
What are you doing up there?

1322
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:26,191
Joey! Come on down here,
both of you!

1323
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:32,364
How about your glasses? Can I get
you a drink, Mr. Or Mrs. Prentice?

1324
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:37,119
No, thank you.
John? Mike? No, you've had enough.

1325
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:38,870
Dad. What's going on?

1326
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,706
MATT: There's something
I want to say.

1327
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:45,919
I'd like you to sit down and see if you
can keep quiet. Please, sit down, John.

1328
01:38:46,129 --> 01:38:48,922
Sit down, Chris, please.

1329
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:54,886
I have a few things to say, and you
might just think they're important.

1330
01:38:55,096 --> 01:38:59,349
It's been a strange day.
That's not putting it too strongly.

1331
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:03,186
I might even say it's been
an extraordinary day.

1332
01:39:03,396 --> 01:39:07,941
I've been thinking about the day
and the way it has gone,

1333
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:11,028
and it seems to me that now

1334
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:14,906
I need to make a few
personal statements

1335
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,492
for a variety of reasons.

1336
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:27,794
The day began for me when
I came in and Tillie said to me...

1337
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:30,547
Excuse me. Tillie!

1338
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,549
This'll only take a second.

1339
01:39:32,759 --> 01:39:37,054
Everything's been ready...
All right, Tillie. Sit down.

1340
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:40,098
This is Miss Matilda Binks,

1341
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:43,727
who's been a member
of this family for 22 years.

1342
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:48,023
And who today has made a great
deal of trouble. Sit down.

1343
01:39:51,235 --> 01:39:55,822
Now, the minute I walked into
this house this afternoon,

1344
01:39:56,032 --> 01:40:01,078
Miss Binks said to me,
"All hell done broke loose now."

1345
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:03,955
I asked her, naturally enough,
to what she referred,

1346
01:40:04,165 --> 01:40:07,918
and she said,
"You'll see." And I did.

1347
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:13,548
After some preliminary guessing games,
at which I was never very good,

1348
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:19,221
it was explained by my daughter
that she intended to get married,

1349
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:23,975
and that her intended was a
young man whom I'd never met

1350
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:26,895
who happened to be a Negro.

1351
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:31,566
I think it's fair to say that
I responded to this news

1352
01:40:31,776 --> 01:40:34,778
in the same manner that any normal
father would respond to it,

1353
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:39,074
unless, of course, his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

1354
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:41,410
In a word, I was flabbergasted.

1355
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:44,788
And while I was
still being flabbergasted,

1356
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:49,501
I was informed by my daughter,
a very determined young woman,

1357
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:55,090
much like her mother,
that the marriage was on

1358
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:58,885
no matter what her mother
and I might feel about it.

1359
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:05,183
Then the next rather startling
development occurred, when you said

1360
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:09,020
that unless we, her mother and I,
approved of the marriage,

1361
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,273
there would be no marriage.

1362
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:13,608
You didn't.
What a funny thing to do.

1363
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:15,026
Joey.

1364
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:21,992
This may be the last chance I'll ever
have to tell you to do anything.

1365
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:24,578
So I'm telling you, shut up.

1366
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:33,253
Now, it became clear
that we had one single day

1367
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:37,966
in which to make up our minds as to how
we felt about this whole situation.

1368
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:41,678
So, what happened?
My wife, typically enough,

1369
01:41:41,888 --> 01:41:46,558
decided to ignore every
practical aspect of the situation

1370
01:41:46,768 --> 01:41:51,104
and was carried away in some kind of a
romantic haze, which made her, in my view,

1371
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:55,859
totally inaccessible to
anything in the way of reason.

1372
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:02,908
I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence,

1373
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,578
who began by forcing
his way into the situation,

1374
01:42:06,788 --> 01:42:11,917
and then insulting my intelligence
by mouthing 300 platitudes,

1375
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:15,504
and ending just a half-hour ago
by coming to my room

1376
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:19,132
and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

1377
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:22,803
What time is your plane? 10:45.

1378
01:42:23,888 --> 01:42:25,305
Right.

1379
01:42:25,515 --> 01:42:30,060
Now, Mr. Prentice,
clearly a most reasonable man,

1380
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:35,273
says he has no wish to offend me
but wants to know if I'm a nut.

1381
01:42:36,442 --> 01:42:39,444
Mrs. Prentice says that,
like her husband,

1382
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:44,658
I'm a burned-out shell of a man
who cannot remember what it's like

1383
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:50,288
to love a woman the way
her son loves my daughter.

1384
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:58,880
And strange as it seems,

1385
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:02,217
that's the first statement
made to me all day

1386
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,595
with which I'm prepared
to take issue.

1387
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:13,019
Because I think you're wrong.
You're as wrong as you could be.

1388
01:43:14,063 --> 01:43:18,024
I admit that I hadn't
considered it,

1389
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:21,778
but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

1390
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:27,784
And there is absolutely nothing
that your son feels for my daughter

1391
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:32,372
that I didn't feel
for Christina.

1392
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,126
Old, yes.

1393
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:39,170
Burned-out, certainly.

1394
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:43,842
But I can tell you,
the memories are still there.

1395
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:48,680
Clear, intact, indestructible.

1396
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:53,643
They'll be there if I live to be 110.
Where John made his mistake

1397
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:58,398
was attaching so much importance to
what her mother and I might think.

1398
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:03,528
Because in the final analysis it
doesn't matter a damn what we think.

1399
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:06,948
The only thing that matters
is what they feel

1400
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:12,162
and how much they feel
for each other.

1401
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:19,836
And if it's half
of what we felt...

1402
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:25,383
that's everything.

1403
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:45,528
As for you two and the problems you're going
to have, they seem almost unimaginable.

1404
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:47,822
But you'll have
no problem with me.

1405
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:53,620
And I think that when
Christina and I and your mother

1406
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:59,250
have some time to work on him, you'll
have no problem with your father, John.

1407
01:45:02,004 --> 01:45:07,425
But you do know, I'm sure you
know, what you're up against.

1408
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:11,262
There'll be 100 million people
right here in this country

1409
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:16,893
who'll be shocked and offended
and appalled at the two of you.

1410
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:21,564
And the two of you will
just have to ride that out,

1411
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:25,276
maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

1412
01:45:26,445 --> 01:45:29,614
You can try to ignore
those people,

1413
01:45:29,824 --> 01:45:33,868
or even feel sorry for them and for
their prejudices and their bigotry

1414
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:38,081
and their blind hatreds
and stupid fears,

1415
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:43,712
but where necessary, you'll just
have to cling tight to each other

1416
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,007
and say,
"Screw all those people."

1417
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:52,637
Anybody could make a case, and a hell of a
good case, against your getting married.

1418
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:56,766
The arguments are so obvious
that nobody has to make them.

1419
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,271
But you're two wonderful people

1420
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,107
who happened to fall in love

1421
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:08,737
and happened to have
a pigmentation problem.

1422
01:46:09,655 --> 01:46:14,576
I think that now, no matter what kind
of a case some bastard could make

1423
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:19,706
against your getting married,
there would be only one thing worse.

1424
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:24,627
And that would be if,
knowing what you two are,

1425
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,005
knowing what you two have,

1426
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:30,216
and knowing what you two feel,

1427
01:46:30,426 --> 01:46:32,552
you didn't get married.

1428
01:46:53,491 --> 01:46:58,078
Well, Tillie. When the hell
are we gonna get some dinner?

1429
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:03,291
