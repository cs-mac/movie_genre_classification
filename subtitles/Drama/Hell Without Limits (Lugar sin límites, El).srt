1
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,280
Fat Dog, you've finally appeared

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,910
If I don't catch you today,
I can't report back to base

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,430
After being in the force for this long,
have I ever arrested the wrong person?

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,470
I'll leave that question for the judge

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,710
My philosophy is that ...

6
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,270
Cops catch felons

7
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,020
Before the 1997 Handover

8
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,390
4 fives

9
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,350
Open

10
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
Drink!
-This time doesn't count

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Come, again ... this bottle

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,350
7 sixes

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,830
You lost again
- Do you know how to play?

14
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,510
Waiter, give her the rule book

15
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,510
Let me introduce you.
My younger brother, 'Tiger'

16
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,750
Brother Shan

17
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,150
Hello, Brother Shan
- Hello

18
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,190
You're sweating a lot

19
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,990
That's my adopted brother .. Zha

20
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,230
I have a lot of stuff to move.
There are many smugglers who can do it

21
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,550
- You want to a contract deal
- If you want to do Vietnam ...

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,830
If must be us 3 brothers

23
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,870
Who would know the place better than us?
We are Vietnamese

24
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,950
However you want to split it,
we'll go along with it

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,510
That's all there is to it

26
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,830
I lost again

27
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,230
It doesn't count. Again, again

28
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,910
4 ones, I don't care.
-4 ones?

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,430
Is that right?

30
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,630
Just because you don't think so

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,630
Police checking ID.
Move in

32
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,830
Check ID

33
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,820
You. Get out here

34
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,110
I threw that bottle

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,870
So what?

36
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,750
My apologies

37
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,150
Flashpoint

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,630
1996, January 2nd

39
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,750
Mongkok, [?] Stanley St,
whilst checking ID,
you assaulted a person

40
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,340
And broke the criminal's pelvis in 3 places

41
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,030
He spent 2 months in hospital.
How do you plead?

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,030
1997, February 17th

43
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,990
Yaumatei, Miu St, Triad activity.
You assaulted another person

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,390
The criminal sustained serious head injury

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,350
According to the doctor,
has permanently lost his sense of taste

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,470
How do you plead?

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,470
1996 ...
- That's enough

48
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,110
I'm guilty

49
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,390
In the first half of this year,
on average you have been involved
in 14 cases per month

50
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,510
In each case, you have injured, on average,
2.8 people

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,750
Half a year. You have already broken
your record from last year

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,910
What's the problem with police
apprehending criminals?

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,710
The person making the complaint is me

54
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,550
Are we here to arrest criminals, or police?

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,190
Inspector Ma, I know that
you are an outstanding officer

56
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,750
You have the highest number of solved cases

57
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,990
But I want to remind you ...

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,310
You need to pay attention to your attitude
and the way you operate

59
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,070
I don't think there is a problem

60
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,990
OK, you can
leave

61
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,110
I've timed it

62
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,950
From when I came in,
you've talked for 1 hour

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,630
Who knows, perhaps in an hour,
I could have solved a case

64
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,310
Do you think you need
to reconsider you operating standards

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,660
Don't waste everyone's time

66
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,190
Good

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,800
That's $50K. You want to bet with me?

68
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,300
Betting so big with me,
you'll lose everything

69
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,990
Tiger ... that's not how you play golf

70
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,550
It's not martial arts,
where you use that stance

71
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,660
Here, I'll teach you

72
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,350
It's simple. You hold the club

73
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,550
Most important is that
your thigh and shoulder is level

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,140
Look where you're aiming,
then look at the ball

75
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,390
Then swing through hard

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,430
That's what you shouldn't do

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,430
Again, again

78
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,030
Brother Zha. something's not right

79
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,430
Hold on

80
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,710
These friends don't know anything

81
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,790
You leave first

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,910
I asked you to move the stuff to Vietnam.

83
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,990
But if you're not blaming it on tornados,
then it's because of storms

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,470
It's been 2 months, friend.
You trying to send it to the moon?

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,550
You screwing with me?
- Friend ...

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,630
Big winds and big waves are inevitable

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,750
How about you?

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,630
The blame will be on you if the ship sinks

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,670
The shipment was worth $80 Mil.
[?] You've only paid back $2k

90
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,980
You should have told me earlier,
I would have sent it by courier

91
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,510
It's just a few days by plane

92
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,830
If your shipping it by sea,
of course it will take a few months

93
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,710
Go home and wait

94
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,180
What did you say?

95
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,470
Don't be stupid now

96
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,190
Otherwise, I'll kill you

97
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,830
You trying to scare me?
Which one are you?

98
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,710
Your boss won't come out,
and leaves you flunkies here instead

99
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,750
Get Tony out here!

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,070
Mother fucker

101
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,260
This is how we work

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,670
Don't do that in public

103
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,670
Put on some suntan lotion

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,910
Don't be like that. Is this revenge?

105
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,550
Wait for me.
You two are always bickering

106
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,070
Tan

107
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,830
Don't let him play cool all the time

108
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,310
If you're going to arrest someone,
then just arrest them

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,430
You're always bashing people up.
Yeah, we know you can fight

110
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,830
Every time something happens you
come looking for me. Each time you come
looking for me, you want me to save you

111
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,310
And if something bad happens,
you put it on me.
What do you want me to do?

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,910
What are you still complaining about,
muscle man?

113
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,350
Taking off your clothes all day,
showing your arse

114
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,910
Last time you injured my arm,
the doctor said that there would be complications

115
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,190
You threw a whole bottle of wine
in my face

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,230
If I didn't do something,
everyone would be suspicious

117
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,710
You fought back, remember

118
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,190
You hit me, of course I would retaliate.
You want me to lose my street cred?

119
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,830
Street cred?! You're a cop! Street cred.

120
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,990
Why don't you scream it out louder, idiot

121
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,270
We're all on the same side here,
you shouldn't have been so heavy handed

122
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,590
And you. You know that he is a loose cannon,
and you still go light a fire under him

123
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,910
Who else would do that?

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,870
When you got me into this,
you made it sound good

125
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,830
[?]

126
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,110
- How long do I need to stay undercover?

127
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,990
Don't talk about the past.
Let's talk about the facts

128
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,950
Who is your superior here?

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,190
Oh, this again

130
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,670
What? There's such thing as
a chain of command

131
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,790
Stop arguing. The two of you will probably
never work together again anyway

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,470
Really?

133
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,950
The Complaints department report is out

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,560
You remain team leader,
but next month you report to
the music department

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,630
No need to be that harsh

136
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,110
You said it yourself.
There's a chain of command

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,230
I want to appeal

138
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,550
keep at it. It's up to you now

139
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,950
Same to you

140
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,150
Try not to be so picky.
Do whatever you want to do

141
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,910
If I die, then I die

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,790
I've lived my fill

143
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,350
What sort of playing is that?

144
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,990
Wrong four times out of four

145
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,390
When was I wrong?

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,870
12th section, after the 6th note,
the E sharp

147
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,030
We didn't hear anything wrong,
except for your shouting

148
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,270
As officers,
we should take things seriously

149
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,950
You think we are mucking around?
If you want to do that, leave

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,070
Not everyone does things your way,
Inspector Ma

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,470
You ..
- You must have been wrong

152
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,190
If an officer makes a mistake

153
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,710
They will ruin someone else's life,
or their own

154
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,470
Take it seriously,
and improve your work

155
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,820
What are you doing here, mum?

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,710
I knew that you were here,
and wanted to let you know ..

157
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,630
I'm going back to the country

158
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,910
Wait till I have a bit of free time,
and I'll take you back

159
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,190
I've already waited

160
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,950
Waited until Auntie ChangZhou is dead

161
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,030
I'll go back to pay my respects

162
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,620
If I like it there, I won't come back

163
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,790
Don't be like that, mum.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,430
I'm very lonely here by myself

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,710
You worry all day,
and have no time for me

166
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,310
Take care.
You shouldn't risk so much
going after crooks

167
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,270
What's the most important thing?
It's preserving your own life

168
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,230
Without your life,
how can you be a person

169
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,470
Take care. I'm leaving now

170
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,670
Everyone's just after a living

171
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,510
You took Shan's stuff

172
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,230
He called you out to negotiate,
and you turn it to a fight

173
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,980
And now you ask us to ignore it.
Why?

174
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,150
Shan will disappear

175
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,670
If in the end,
it is found that you are involved,
it won't be good

176
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,350
If you leave it alone,
nothing will happen

177
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,710
If it wasn't for the 3 of you,
nothing would have happened

178
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,110
Its better if you don't mess up our place

179
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,390
If we didn't take you in ...

180
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,820
You'd still be floating in the sea

181
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,590
Our family was stuck in a refugee camp

182
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,550
It wasn't much different to living in prison

183
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,550
Why did we riot?

184
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,310
Because we wanted a place of our own

185
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,590
If there are those that don't want us around

186
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,270
Then we go to war

187
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,870
Boss

188
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,070
How is it? All done?

189
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,470
No good?

190
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,790
No yet

191
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,220
It's not that the talks have broken down,
but they haven't started yet

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,060
Don't do anything for now,
otherwise there'd be nothing to discuss

193
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,390
Don't be unreasonable now.

194
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,830
That's it. Just do it

195
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,940
Wait ...

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,460
You talk to them

197
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,710
Four eyes, your wife takes
your kid to school so early

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,980
It'd be unfortunate if they died

199
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,830
Are you threatening me?

200
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,150
Of course I'm threatening you,
otherwise I wouldn't be shouting
you breakfast [?? ]

201
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,470
I also don't want to hurt
everyone's feelings

202
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,710
If we can work this one out,
there will be a lot more opportunities
for us in the future

203
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,950
The four eyed woman in red ...

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,510
taking her dopey four eyed kid

205
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,030
When I tell you to run over them,
I want you to floor the gas

206
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,350
OK

207
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,510
Quickly, have you thought it over?

208
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,070
Your 4 eyed kid
is about to reach the entrance

209
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,070
I can't hear anyone answering me

210
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,110
We will ignore the situation with Shan

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,190
That's too quiet,
he won't be able to hear you

212
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,070
We will ignore the situation with Shan

213
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,790
Don't be careless now, y'hear

214
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,270
Zha, this is Da Xia

215
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,510
Let's go out for drinks
when you're free, we're all friends here

216
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,150
You should have said from the start

217
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,030
Have breakfast

218
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,670
I've spent the money to buy it ...
are you not giving me any face?

219
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,430
Run over them

220
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,710
OK

221
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,300
Turn

222
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,030
Are you a dog? So obedient

223
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,510
Just because I said it, you'd do it?
You could have killed someone

224
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,430
How can you be so dumb?

225
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,230
Hey, it's my shout for
your birthday tonight

226
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,950
I going to meet some friends

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,380
What? You have friends?

228
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,470
Yes
-OK

229
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,030
Here, have fun

230
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,220
- Thank you, Boss

231
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,790
Lily?

232
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,630
It's me. Are you free?
Come over

233
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,590
What are you saying?

234
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,270
Why are you shouting at me
out of the sudden?

235
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,830
Hi May,
I'm looking for your daughter

236
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,550
She's dead?

237
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,630
I'm so sorry ...

238
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,950
Bobby?
It's Wilson

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,750
What's up?
It's my birthday today

240
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,590
Don't talk about that stuff

241
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,670
I won the lottery, I want to spend it up

242
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,350
Hello? Hello?

243
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,350
Hi, is Julie there

244
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,590
Happy birthday

245
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,910
Thank you

246
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,830
Have you finished work?

247
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,710
Not yet. I'll come over after work

248
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,710
OK, bye

249
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,390
Bye

250
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,710
It's been a while

251
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,710
It hasn't been that long.
We met half a year ago

252
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,270
Have you been to Vietnam recently?

253
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
If you're going,
you should be careful

254
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,670
You might get caught

255
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,390
Even if I'm just going there
for a bowl of noodles?

256
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,430
I thought you wanted to stop selling alcohol,
Why are you still doing it?

257
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,030
Do you think I like it?

258
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,870
What else can I do?

259
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,220
Unless ...

260
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,230
You want me to be a prostitute?

261
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,990
Don't say that.
Do something respectable

262
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,310
You know that 'Blue Girl' (beer )

263
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,230
[?] got popular
because she sold herself

264
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,190
How about Carlsberg?

265
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,510
He was unfortunate

266
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,940
He sold himself until he was an old man
before he got the brand

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,030
Otherwise it wouldn't have been called
'Uncle Carls' (phonetic pun )

268
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,150
How about mine?

269
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,750
Now, it's wrong to say that threes
no future in living large

270
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,310
It was only because he lived large,
that he got the Johnnie Walker brand

271
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,070
I'll let myself out later.
Let's have a shower

272
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,390
Tiger, are we going to do this

273
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,390
This is not for you

274
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,270
Where so you want to go later?

275
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,390
I want to go for a picnic
-OK

276
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,950
Take our daughter away from here

277
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,150
Cops! Get in!

278
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,310
You're lucky

279
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,110
You can leave hospital at anytime

280
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,990
If you keep fighting,
I won't let it go so easily

281
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,150
If you want to die, do it far away from me.
Don't keep involving me

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,870
I want to turn state witness

283
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,550
Come in

284
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,750
Inspector Wong,
we've bought the criminal

285
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,030
That hurts, Inspector Wong

286
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,230
Do you have something to drink?
It's hot.

287
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,740
Shan's spilled the beans about Tony

288
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,670
That's great, go arrest him then

289
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,630
[?] We have to prepare

290
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,190
Those guys are insane,
if they wanted revenge,
the first to die would be you

291
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,830
I know, I'm more scared than you

292
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,150
Inspector Wong, please don't tell me
you're leading the team on this one

293
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,470
Relax, I won't be leading.
I'm not the one that has been keeping
tabs on those Vietnamese kids

294
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,510
Get them to call back that handsome
and outstanding officer

295
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,310
This is a time
when the department needs him the most

296
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,350
It's you who needs him the most

297
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,310
Yes

298
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,790
Inspector Wong

299
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,390
Shut the door

300
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,710
What are you doing?

301
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,630
Do you want me to die,
opening the door so wide

302
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,310
This time just speak
your mind if there is anything

303
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,740
Fine, otherwise,
why would we call you back?

304
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,100
Help us out, solve this case,
and we can all go swimming OK?

305
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,300
Yes, Inspector Wong

306
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,990
Here, put this on your head

307
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,180
Put it on

308
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,950
Let me finish my smoke
- Forget it, put it out

309
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,310
You won't get any girls

310
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,310
Put it on, you fuckwit

311
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,550
Inspector Wong,
he's not co-operating

312
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,070
Take him out for a beating, then

313
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,550
We're about to have the '97 Handover,
can you guys take things a little more seriously?

314
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,110
It's their mother's big birthday tonight

315
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,190
The 3 will definitely come out tonight

316
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,590
First we take care of their associates

317
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,230
Four eyes, we want to interview you back
at the station about the Vietnamese case

318
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,030
OK

319
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,430
Brother Wilson

320
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,150
Brother Wilson

321
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,550
Eat, try a bit
-This way Sir

322
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,160
It smells good, try it
- Auntie

323
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,870
Wishing you fortunes deeper than the Eastern Sea,
happiness higher than the Southern mountains

324
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,830
That you become prettier year by year,
and that you are forever youthful

325
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,750
Thank you ..
- Thank you

326
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,780
Auntie, is your appetite good today?

327
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,310
Stop talking to her, she's stopped eating

328
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,670
OK
- Leave

329
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,750
Auntie, enjoy your meal

330
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,510
If they don't return the calls,
then keep calling

331
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,910
You don't need me to tell you that.
What time is it already? Nobody's here

332
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,790
- Have a bite
- Mother fucker, go!

333
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,990
Here, have a bit

334
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,030
Tiger

335
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,510
Come here

336
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,870
You're so loud that
mother's not eating any more

337
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,310
kneel

338
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,350
Apologize to mother

339
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,150
Mother, please eat some

340
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,110
Everyone's here

341
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,310
If no one goes to see Zha,
who will be there to celebrate
their mother's birthday?

342
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,350
Have a mouthful

343
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,350
Eat

344
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,310
If you don't want this,
then what do you want?

345
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,990
You don't like it?

346
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,950
We'll order something else, OK?
Sea cucumber?

347
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,110
Abalone?
You don't like it?

348
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,460
Then I'll order
Birds Nest Soup for you

349
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,430
Sharks Fin?

350
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,990
Big Brother,
something's wrong

351
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,270
What's more important
than mother not eating?

352
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,190
Eat

353
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,470
Tiger, feed mother

354
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,270
Time to work ...

355
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,950
Stay here tonight

356
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,670
Someone will take care of you

357
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,190
You must catch them, Inspector Ma

358
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,540
Here

359
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,950
Have a mouthful

360
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,870
The food here doesn't suit you

361
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,310
I'll take you somewhere else, OK?

362
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,750
- Tiger
-Where?

363
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,940
Don't worry, let's go

364
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,030
Wilson, come here

365
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,350
Coming

366
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,990
They're all waiting for you there
- Quickly

367
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,790
OK

368
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,830
Manager

369
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,470
Did you drive today?

370
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,430
Which car? Where is it parked?

371
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,470
Hello?

372
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,310
Tony, go and get the money

373
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,230
I'll leave with mother first.
We'll meet at the pier

374
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,710
Understood

375
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,910
Where to, Tony?

376
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,230
To the garage

377
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,060
Second brother, what's happening?

378
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,190
- Have you seen these people?
- What time was that at?

379
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,190
- Inspector Ma
- What's the situation?

380
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,910
There is someone injured,
an ambulance is coming

381
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,030
Xiao Ying

382
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,470
- Check his vehicle rego
-Yes

383
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,870
- Xiao Ya, tie up the loose ends here
-Yes

384
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,110
Hello?

385
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,310
Where are you?
I'm at your front door

386
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,870
I'm busy.
I'll call you back later

387
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,230
I can wait here for you to come back

388
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,070
Not tonight

389
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,430
I've already made a spare key for you

390
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,990
I'll give it to you next time

391
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,030
Can you not talk on the phone

392
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,430
Sorry

393
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,750

is a dark green Mazda MPV

Help out

398
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,460
Brother Tiger,
did you lock the door?

399
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,390
Oh yeah

400
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,350
I'll do it, you get in the car first

401
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,470
They're leaving with the money,
call you later

402
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,750
We can go now, Brother Tony

403
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,100
- Have you locked it?
- I have

404
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,390
Sit in the back

405
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,510
OK

406
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,110
That's the car

407
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,950
Wilson, give me your phone

408
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,190
Brother Tony

409
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,750
Mother, sit tight

410
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,230
Don't drive so fast

411
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,710
Pull over

412
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,230
I said, pull over

413
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,830
Mother, sit tight

414
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,390
Jia Hui, ChangAn direction

415
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,590
Are you alright. Hang in there

416
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,350
- I want to vomit.
- Vomit in here

417
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,310
You'll feel better after you bring it up

418
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,390
It's alright

419
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,230
We in the chemical factory district

420
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,990
Get out

421
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,390
We're going to the pier

422
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,910
Have a look

423
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,190
Hey, Sir

424
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,350
Are you alright?

425
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,390
- How's Wilson?
- Inspector Wong

426
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,430
Don't know yet,
they're working on him

427
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,900
If he can be saved then it's alright.
Stay calm

428
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,950
Hey, what are you doing?

429
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,670
I won't let you off

430
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,310
What are you doing?

431
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,790
What's it to you

432
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,190
Are you Julie?

433
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,630
Assaulting a police officer,
I can charge you

434
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,950
So what if you're a cop?

435
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,990
Wilson is my partner

436
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,310
He is also a cop

437
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,430
What are you in for?
Triad activity?

438
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,740
I'm not a Triad member

439
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,180
No? Then follow me

440
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,950
Call me Brother Zha

441
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,950
Do it

442
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,630
Brother Zha

443
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,840
Have you ever seen
your 3 son's beating up others?

444
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,950
I have 3 sons?

445
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,430
I've never seen it

446
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,070
Sir, can you call the police for me?

447
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,630
Sir, call the police for me

448
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,390
My son is missing

449
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,860
No one will come to see her on holidays

450
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,630
Perhaps, never at any other time either

451
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,230
Take care of her for me.
She tends to wander

452
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,510
It's my birthday. I'm 80.
You should have come earlier

453
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,710
I'm 80 ..

454
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,670
Xian Wei Zha,
there is sufficient evidence to show

455
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,590
That during the period from
1992 to Feb 1997

456
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,590
you were involved in smuggling,
aggravated assault, and Triad activities

457
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,390
Those are the charges.
How do you plead?

458
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,950
Not guilty

459
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,590
Hearing is set for May this year

460
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,940
Transfer the case
to the North kowloon courts

461
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,310
Use this time to gather your reasons

462
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,470
You are denied bail
or permission to leave the country

463
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,510
All your assets are now frozen

464
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,950
Until sentence is passed

465
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,260
You're putting it all on me

466
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,270
You think you can convict me?

467
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,430
Let's go

468
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,070
Take your wandering hands off me

469
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,500
I'll sue you for sexual assault

470
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,830
Let's go

471
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,910
3 months later

472
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,630
I won't be able
to keep up with you soon

473
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,670
Then I'll slow down to wait for you

474
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,510
Take it slowly.
You'll get used to it

475
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,430
Of course it will be slow

476
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,430
I've lost the use on a leg,
you think I'll get used to that?

477
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,470
Everything's sorted out for you

478
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,220
Next week,
you'll be changed to a desk job

479
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,790
Desk job?

480
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,270
Why don't you get the HK government
to pay me some compensation?

481
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,990
Not only won't they pay, but and I
have to cough up my own legal fees

482
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,990
Are you kidding me?
Is this what you call 'everything's sorted'?

483
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,420
You know everything
I've done for the force

484
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,470
What have I got out of it?

485
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,380
When I am out,
which path will lead to wealth?

486
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,030
There are so many colleagues
waiting for your return, why don't you
persevere for a bit longer?

487
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,270
I'm persevering now

488
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,310
How many people are waiting
for my return, just one?

489
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,990
I've forgotten something,
don't wait for me

490
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,670
Slowly ...

491
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,070
Big brother, Tiger and I will return
before your trial

492
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,870
I won't give Wilson or
Shan the opportunity to testify

493
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,830
Tiger

494
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,470
Mother

495
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,630
3 sons

496
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,870
I'll take you home

497
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,030
Mother,
do you remember this place?

498
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,950
We used to live here

499
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,310
After I pickup Big brother,
we can leave HK

500
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,910
Give me

501
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,150
What are you smiling about?

502
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,270
Nothing. Perhaps injuring
your leg wasn't completely a bad thing

503
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,750
This way you can't run amok every day

504
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,910
And can stay home a keep me company

505
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,950
You've taken care of me for so long

506
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,030
You must like me a lot

507
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,710
Don't you know
that in the DNA of every woman

508
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,630
is encoded a natural ability
to care for others

509
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,310
On behalf of your godly
inherited ability,

510
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,310
I hope that it will be like this forever

511
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,270
Thanks

512
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,390
Don't mention it

513
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,150
They're here

514
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,420
I want to get changed

515
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,430
- Careful
- Quickly

516
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,470
- Hello
- Hello

517
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,950
Delivery

518
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,590
Be careful

519
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,670
Come and have a look.
It's good stuff

520
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,630
Is it that good?

521
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,820
It's heavier than a throne

522
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,440
How can you live on the roof?
I'm so tired

523
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,910
We only helped carry it

524
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,110
Jun, he bought it and delivered it

525
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,870
Where do you want it?

526
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,110
Over there

527
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,500
OK

528
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,230
Move over

529
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,510
Put some muscle into it

530
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,470
Slowly, don't scratch it

531
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,820
That cost over $30k.
He paid for it himself

532
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,260
That's sincerity. Accept it

533
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,230
Do you have a power board?
- Yes

534
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,630
Here, let me do that.
You guys are so useless

535
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,630
Where's the power point?

536
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,380
I know you're no good with English,
so it's in Chinese

537
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,150
Like driving, it's automatic

538
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,110
Try using this button

539
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,910
You always said that your leg hurt

540
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,390
This can help improve
the circulation to your leg

541
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,510
The blood moves freely to the leg,
but the leg itself can't

542
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,070
Walking should be simple for a person
with your intelligence and constitution,

543
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,230
Train your right leg to be as mobile as
your left leg, and you'll be fine

544
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,990
What did you say?

545
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,500
A joke

546
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,950
It's so funny, but no-ones laughing.
Forget it.

547
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,710
I'll get it

548
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,790
Takeaway delivery

549
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,670
Smells good

550
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,100
What is it?

551
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,270
Something good

552
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,590
Actually as a cop,
there's a lot of pressure

553
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,630
Why don't you have a think about
doing something else?

554
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,910
Have a good think about it.
Whatever you do, include me

555
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,030
I'm scared that
you'll just hit everything

556
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,630
Actually, the most important thing
is having a family

557
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,350
I envy you

558
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,020
What's more important than family?

559
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,790
If you're like me, you'll be happy

560
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,390
Come over and eat

561
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,830
Wait, let's take a picture first

562
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,790
OK, take a picture as we eat

563
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,270
No, picture first

564
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,950
This is my only request

565
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,630
Picture with the chicken?

566
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,910
Whatever, just go with it

567
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,380
Come

568
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,390
The chicken is a bit cold.

569
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,660
Wait

570
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,030
Let's heat it up

571
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,750
If we don't improve our standards,
how can we become better people?

572
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,150
It doesn't matter, we can still eat it

573
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,990
It's so easy to heat it up

574
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,540
Chicken, 200 degrees

575
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,830
- I'll go help Inspector Wong
- (So don't eat it, Da Pao )

576
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,470
Is Julie alright?

577
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,470
She's staying for observation

578
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,150
Are you alright?

579
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,270
I'm temporarily
standing in for Inspector Wong

580
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,470
For security reasons,
you are all placed on leave

581
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,780
They're killing police,
and killing witnesses

582
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,390
Even a retard would know that those
Vietnamese are behind it.
And you want us to take a break?

583
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,470
I'm worried for your safety

584
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,230
We're all risking our lives

585
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,310
You step in charge, and the first thing
you do is put us on leave?

586
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,990
You're feeling confused
and emotional right now, please leave

587
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,030
When I was undercover, I was living
under the cover of fear every day

588
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,150
I thought that once I mangled my leg
that I would never have another good day

589
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,070
But even then, they blow up my home

590
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,110
Now you want me to leave?
Madam,

591
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,990
The uniform you're wearing
was not meant to be so casually abused

592
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,190
If there is sufficient evidence,
I will arrest the people involved

593
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,510
Do you have any evidence?

594
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,820
You guys ask Madam,
what else needs to be done

595
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,430
Where is Tony?

596
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,230
Enough! You're going to kill him

597
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,030
Give me your gun
Give me your gun

598
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,350
Give me your gun

599
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,380
Give me your gun

600
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,150
Give me your gun

601
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,190
He doesn't know.
Go to court tomorrow

602
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,990
Madam, what do we do now?

603
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,190
The most important thing now,
is to find out what happened to Tony

604
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,550
The most important thing now
is to protect Wilson in hospital

605
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,510
He is the only witness

606
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,540
Xiao Ying, let's go

607
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,670
Let's go, Xiao Ya
What are you still writing?

608
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,430
My mother has a place in the country

609
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,510
I really want to return
to Song Flower River

610
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,190
Do you know why it is called
Song Flower River?

611
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,590
There was a story from long ago

612
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,590
The Song tree used to be able to bloom

613
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,790
The people from my area,
all had to leave to earn a living

614
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,910
Before they left, they would pluck
a Song Flower as a memento

615
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,310
They told the tree that they were
just borrowing it, and would definitely
come back to return it.

616
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,110
But as they left, one by one

617
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,910
None of them ever returned

618
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,950
In the end,
the Song Flower could not blossom

619
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,150
In order to remember it

620
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,670
The people there named the river,
the Song Flower River

621
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,470
You're sick of this place?

622
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,110
Actually,
living in HK for this long

623
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,790
I've never felt that this place was home

624
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,910
Mother said that she would like us to return

625
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,550
The 3 of us

626
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,910
It's 2 months now

627
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,550
You don't like it?

628
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,710
Everyone entering
the hospital must be searched

629
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,990
All the exits, doorways,
backdoors, back stairs, toilets,

630
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,710
Must all have men posted.
Understood?

631
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,670
Yes

632
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,150
Nothing must happen to Wilson
before he goes to court

633
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,910
The baby's hungry

634
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,310
Should we give it something to eat?

635
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,590
I'll go buy something for you to eat

636
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,670
Don't go anywhere

637
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,790
Inspector Ma, wait

638
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,070
Wilson, Inspector Ma told you
not to go anywhere

639
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,710
Thanks

640
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,790
Police! Move

641
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,590
Shots fired inside elevator.
The elevator is heading for the roof

642
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,230
Get backup. Quickly

643
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,660
She's here with me

644
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,230
OK

645
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,070
What do you want?

646
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,190
You're scared?

647
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,190
Yes, yes

648
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,110
Whatever you want, just say it.
I'll do anything

649
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,820
Watch out.
You have a death wish?

650
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,670
Move

651
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,350
Mummy

652
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,190
Throw the gun over here

653
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,950
Put the child down

654
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,910
I said throw the gun over

655
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,550
Can you hear me?

656
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,270
Put the child down

657
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,700
Do you want her to die?

658
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,430
Inspector Ma,
what's the situation?

659
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,230
Inspector Ma

660
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,030
It's time to go to court

661
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,350
Hello?

662
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,310
Wilson, where are you?

663
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,630
I'm heading off to court

664
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,790
Did something happen to your Julie?

665
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,260
Yes

666
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,870
Don't believe them.
They'll never just let her go

667
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,830
I have no choice

668
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,830
How can you not have a choice?

669
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,790
You've chosen to help those bastards

670
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,620
I don't want anything to happen to her

671
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,310
I don't want anything
to happen to the both of you

672
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,870
Do you want to die with her?

673
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,390
You need to record a statement

674
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,150
You beat the criminal to death

675
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,990
Then arrest me

676
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,150
Witness. You can now testify

677
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,620
I don't remember anything

678
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,430
My judgment is

679
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,020
The witness is unable to testify
because he claims amnesia

680
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,950
All charges against the accused ...

681
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,700
are dropped due to lack of evidence

682
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,350
Tony

683
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,150
I'm out

684
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,790
Speak. Where?

685
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,030
South ShengWei

686
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,060
Come quickly.
I'll be waiting

687
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,900
Stop it. Don't hit him

688
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,030
Stop hitting him

689
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,030
Wilson

690
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,470
Wilson

691
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,070
I never thought that
I would be able to leave

692
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,150
I just want you to let her go

693
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,750
Wilson

694
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,590
Shoot, shoot him, Tony

695
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,950
Come on, you scared?

696
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,700
Drop the gun, drop the gun

697
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,790
Your momma ...

698
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,950
- Bastard
- Shoot

699
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,350
Don't talk about my mother!

700
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,910
Boss

701
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,390
I'm going to kill you two bastards

702
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:42,390
Fuck

703
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,630
I'll drive

704
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,710
Open the door

705
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,910
What are you thinking?
Open the door

706
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,630
What are you doing?

707
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,310
Leave with me.
Don't go back

708
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,670
Leave with me.
You promised you wouldn't go

709
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,550
Ma Jun, come out and fight

710
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,830
Fuck you

711
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,470
Ammo

712
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,430
Mother

713
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:17,310
I have three sons, they're missing

714
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,350
Have you seen them?

715
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,230
I've lost my 3 sons

716
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,870
Can you help find them for me?

717
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:43,310
Have you seen them?
I have 3 sons ...

718
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,630
I have 3 sons ...

719
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,830
Have you seen them?

720
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,390
You're finished, Tony

721
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,710
All the time I've been in the force,
have I ever arrested the wrong person?

722
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,590
This question,
I'll leave to the judge

723
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,630
My philosophy is ...

724
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:08,830
that cops catch crooks

725
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,710
Everything that I've done ...

726
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,390
Has been to maintain the peace.
