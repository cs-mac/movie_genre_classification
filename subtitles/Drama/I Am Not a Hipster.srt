How's it going?

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,416
I, uhh...

3
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,052
I can't believe
you guys showed up

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,888
considering how much
of an asshole I am.

5
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,859
Uhh, I want to thank Joel
and Darla for helping me out,

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,362
and Tim for letting me play.

7
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:34,103
So, feels like
it's been a while.

8
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,210
I hope I don't screw this up.

<i>Brook?</i>

33
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,331
<i>Are you there?
Pick up the phone.</i>

34
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:24,702
<i>I hope you know we're staying
with you for three days.</i>

35
00:03:24,703 --> 00:03:25,902
<i>We're excited to see you.</i>

36
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:26,905
<i>Tell him I say hi.</i>

37
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,538
<i>Mez says hi.</i>

38
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:31,108
<i>Umm, sorry, I didn't want to
leave this on your machine.</i>

39
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,412
<i>But I don't know, I just don't
want you to be surprised.</i>

40
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,015
<i>Dad's coming so...</i>

41
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:41,051
<i>Just... Will you call me
if you get this? I love you.</i>

42
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,807
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

43
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,419
What's up, Clarke?

44
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,922
<i>You answered the phone!</i>

45
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:21,926
<i>What's up, man?
It's me, Clarke.</i>

46
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,427
I know.

47
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:24,462
<i>Hi, man.</i>

48
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,698
<i>Well, I just wanted to, uhh...</i>

49
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,432
<i>to let you know that,
today, I woke up.</i>

50
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,903
<i>And I felt very inspired
and motivated to, like,</i>

51
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,436
<i>push our career</i>

52
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,570
<i>into, like,
another level, dude.</i>

53
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,107
<i>It's going to be awesome, man.</i>

54
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,344
<i>Umm, anyways, so I wanted to
go over some bullet points</i>

55
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,743
<i>for today's radio interview,
dude.</i>

56
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,247
Oh, shit, that's today?

57
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,148
<i>Yeah.</i>

58
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,283
You know I hate doing
this kind of stuff.

59
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,451
I really don't see the point.

60
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,118
<i>Well, as your manager,
I think you should really</i>

61
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,788
<i>take advantage of
this opportunity, dude.</i>

62
00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:51,789
Clarke.

63
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,725
<i>Yeah?</i>

64
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,792
I don't need a manager, man.

65
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:57,595
<i>Oh.</i>

66
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:00,497
I'll just work on some stuff.
And then I'll meet you there.

67
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,599
<i>Oh my God,
thank you so much, Brook.</i>

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,400
<i>It's going to be awesome,
I'm telling you.</i>

69
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,939
All right, okay. So, I'll see
you there, all right?

70
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,974
<i>Okay, cool. Umm, so I'll see
you at the radio interview.</i>

71
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:12,608
<i>And just call me
if you can't make it</i>

72
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,569
<i>'cause this guy's really,
really looking forward</i>

73
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:16,579
<i>to meeting you. And that's it.</i>

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,083
<i>And I know I'm talking a lot.
Sorry, Brook.</i>

75
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,549
That's okay.

76
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,984
<i>Okay, man. Umm...</i>

77
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,021
I'll see you later.

Hey, fuckhead! What's this?
A fucking bike lane, isn't it?

99
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,675
Have you got
a fucking green light?

100
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:01,550
Have you got a green light, man?

101
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,119
Oh, look, it's still here,
still... Oh, ho!

102
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,155
See? That was, like, 35 seconds.

103
00:08:12,156 --> 00:08:14,324
So, did you listen to
that new Paper Ted album

104
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,494
I sent you this morning?

105
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,861
Nope.

106
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,461
You got to check
your email more.

107
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:19,930
This guy is blowing my mind.

108
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,096
He's, like, New Wave-ish,

109
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,765
kind of like the Nimbles
in the early '90s.

110
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,101
And this guy has a Master's
in Electrical Engineering

111
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,303
or something like that.
He makes his own sounds, like...

112
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,539
It's sick.
I can't even explain it.

113
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,110
Look, I really got to piss.
How much time do I have?

114
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,144
Five minutes.

115
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,580
All right.

116
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,912
Hey, I was going to ask you,

117
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,681
think you could perform at
my art show this Thursday?

118
00:08:38,682 --> 00:08:40,849
Man, you know how I am
about that kind of stuff.

119
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,085
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. You know,
it's only a couple songs.

120
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,720
It would be, actually,
really fast.

121
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,125
I just hate playing
at art shows, man.

122
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,725
People talk too much.

123
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,762
Yeah, I hate that.
It's annoying.

124
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:54,164
I'm going to be there.
I just don't want to play.

125
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:56,467
It's...
I'll figure something out.

126
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:57,634
You sure?

127
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,136
Yes. Am I sure?
Yeah, focus on this.

128
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,705
Umm, don't forget to
plug Friday's show.

129
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,107
I'm going to be
listening to you online.

130
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:07,676
And... And, uhh, yeah, man,
rock it out. You look good.

131
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,681
I'm excited for you.
That's all I wanted to...

132
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,551
Close the door.
There it is, closed.

Cool, thanks.

00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,570
Uhh, Ronnie,
let's get a level on this guy.

140
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,238

It's 1:10 on the clock.

This is your man Bradley Haines

147
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,926
with an instalment of
SD Underground,

148
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:59,329
bringing you everything
we can dig up

about the San Diego
indie rock scene.

150
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:06,237
Now, sitting right across from
me is a really special guest.

151
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,273
You might remember him
from a little project

152
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,173
he released last year

153
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,677
<i>entitled Canines.</i>

154
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,646
It came completely
out of the blue

155
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:18,180
and blew up on the internet
practically overnight.

156
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,315
Yeah, you know who
I'm talking about.

157
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:23,255
I'm talking about
singer-songwriter Brook Hyde.

158
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,489
Brook, welcome to my studio.

159
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,792
Thanks.

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,462
Let's just give the folks
a little background about you.

161
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,763
You're... You're fairly new
to our city, correct?

162
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:37,566
Uhh, yeah. I've been here
about two years.

163
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:38,607
I guess that's fairly new.

164
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,373
Yeah, that's new.
Where are you from?

165
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,874
I'm from rural Ohio.

166
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,509
You know Pretenders?
You a big Pretenders guy?

167
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,777
Nah, nah, I don't.

168
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:49,814
♪ Ohio ♪

169
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,282
No?

170
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,550
So, where you from in Ohio?

171
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,654
Uhh, west central Ohio,
little town called Houston.

172
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,455
"Houston"?

173
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,456
Yep.

174
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,589
Houston, like, Houston...

175
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,360
Is that Houston Street
or Houston Avenue

176
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,229
in New York, Ronnie?

177
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,965
Uhh, I just know Houston
in Texas.

178
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,868
Okay.

179
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,803
What was Houston, Ohio like?

180
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:16,374
Had a lot of craft fairs,
a lot of chilli cook-offs.

181
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,642
Oh yeah, a lot of those?

182
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,977
Yeah, you could probably go to
one every day if you wanted.

183
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:22,344
Yeah, I might do that.

184
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,512
I'm the kind of guy who, like,
if I eat something...

185
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:24,682
Like, let's say
I'm eating chicken...

186
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,152
I eat chicken every day
for, like, a month.

187
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,422
And then I don't eat anymore.
Like, I'm a streak eater.

188
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,388
You ever... What about you?

189
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,089
Umm, I've never heard of that.

190
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,092
You never heard of that?

191
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,093
No.

192
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,164
So, you... You come from
a big family, I hear.

193
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:45,402
Yeah. I've got three sisters:
Joy, Spring and Merrily.

194
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:48,240
Ha, those are...
Those are pretty cool names.

195
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,406
Yeah.

196
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,708
Who came up with those,
your mom or your dad?

197
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,877
It was definitely my mom.

198
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,379
Is your mom who you got

199
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,180
the creative genes from?

200
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:57,315
Uhh, she's pretty creative.

201
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,315
Yeah?

202
00:11:58,316 --> 00:11:59,450
Yeah.

203
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,186
You got the creative side
from your mom.

204
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,420
What you get from your dad?

205
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:05,855
What do you mean?

206
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,926
I mean, like,
what your dad pass on to you?

207
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:12,797
He taught me how to say "Fuck".

208
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,598
Wow.

209
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,570
Uhh, Brook, you can't cuss.

210
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,939
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

211
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,475
Believe me, I had to learn too.

212
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,244
So, umm, there's a lot
of buzz about you, uhh,

213
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:28,444
in the indie scene.

214
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,647
And there's so many musicians
I know

215
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:31,982
that would just kill
to trade places with you.

216
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:36,787
You mean they want to make no
money and be mildly successful

217
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,355
to a small group of people?

218
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:40,891
I like your humility.

219
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,492
But I mean, come on,
give yourself a break.

220
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,993
I think you've done
pretty well for yourself.

221
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:46,398
You've really generated
a cult following

222
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,599
over the last 12 months.

223
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
And I'm sure that cult following

224
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,201
is going to be
very happy to hear

225
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:54,239
that you are headlining a show

226
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,242
this Friday
at San Diego's Casbah.

227
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:59,576
Is that correct?

228
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:01,946
Yeah, that's what I hear.

229
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,149
Except to hear some
new material there?

230
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,417
Honestly, probably not.

231
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,687
But you been writing some new
stuff since the last album?

232
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,489
No, not really. It's just...

233
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,192
It just has been feeling
kind of pointless to me lately.

234
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:18,428
You mean the industry?

235
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:22,432
I mean everything,
making music, making art,

236
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,836
It all just seems
really stupid to me right now

237
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,470
for some reason.

238
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,538
How so?

239
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:32,643
I don't know. I just...

240
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,547
I have this neighbour
who's got this garden.

241
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:40,183
And she's, umm...
She's got all these sections.

242
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:43,585
She's got the carrots over here.
She's got cabbages over there.

243
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,789
She's got fruit trees
in the back.

244
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,959
And when she's all finished up,

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,693
she's got something she can
actually put in her mouth,

246
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,496
you know, to keep her alive.

247
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:57,066
It's something real.
It's something raw, important.

248
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:01,537
And, umm... And just the other
day, I was...

249
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:03,106
I was watching her.

250
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,610
And I was thinking, "You know
what? That's a real artist.

251
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:09,146
"Why doesn't somebody like that
have, you know,

252
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:12,517
fans and shows and radio
interviews, things, you know?"

253
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,952
That's a really good question,
dude.

254
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:19,189
I mean, every time I see her,
I just...

255
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,158
It makes me think
that what I'm doing

256
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,326
is a complete waste of energy.

257
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,863
So, why do you do it?

258
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,166
I don't know. I don't know.

259
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,735
That's what I'm trying to
figure out right now.

260
00:14:32,736 --> 00:14:36,606
I'm sorry, guys.
I mean, this guy...

261
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:39,276
This guy with
the way he connects

262
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:42,780
and the words he uses,
I see why his music touches us.

263
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:47,554
I mean, wow.

264
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,723
Now...

265
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:55,691
You left the farm.
Why'd you leave the farm?

266
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,629
'Cause you wanted to be
closer to the ocean?

267
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,697
No. I... I hate the beach.

268
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,568
Seriously though, man,
why'd you pick San Diego?

269
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,037
There's a lot of cities
with, uhh,

270
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:08,371
indie music scenes, you know?

271
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,442
I hear Austin's
nipping at our heels.

272
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,912
Your mom was from San Diego,
right?

273
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,815
Is it because
your mom's from here?

274
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,284
She was from here.

275
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,691
What part of the city's
your mom from?

276
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,626
I'd rather not talk about her,
if that's okay.

277
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,928
I was just trying to, like,

278
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:35,769
help the audience, you know,
get to know you better.

279
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,738
We haven't been doing that?

280
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,940
We have. I'm sorry. I was just...

281
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,607
You ran out of questions.

282
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,475
You start asking me questions
about my mom.

283
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:48,111
I don't feel like
talking about her.

284
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,614
You're not okay with that?

285
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,648
No, I'm fine with that.

286
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:54,349
Would you want me to talk about
how she died two years ago?

287
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,651
And I moved out here?

288
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,619
And how when I wrote my album,
with the music,

289
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,454
it was, you know,
I was trying to

290
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:02,157
figure all that out for myself,
how to grieve?

291
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:04,926
Maybe you could fulfill
your childhood dream.

292
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,430
I might, you know,
start balling like...

293
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:09,931
You can have, like,
a Barbara Walters special

294
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:10,853
or something like that.

295
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,100
Is that what
you're trying to do?

296
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,802
Man, what...
Where is this coming from?

297
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:15,338
Look, man, if your mom died,

298
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,243
would you want to talk about it
on some indie pop radio show?

299
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,380
Hmm?

300
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,746
Do you realize
that I'm just trying

301
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,147
to help you promote yourself?

302
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,648
I have no idea, actually,

303
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:28,285
what the fuck
you're trying to do.

304
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:32,656
I'm just trying to
promote your music.

305
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,792
Well, guys, uhh,

306
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,327
that's the end of the interview.

307
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:42,298
Umm, thank you so much for, uhh,

308
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,567
for coming in to Brook Hyde.

309
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,937
I'm going to leave you
with "Spectator",

310
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:49,373

00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,746
in ways that
we don't understand.

319
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,717
But you know,
we're gifted with his music.

320
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:37,092
And just because he's an A-hole,
doesn't mean...

321
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:44,528
I'm... Let's go...
I'm not even on, am I, Ronnie?

322
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:46,562
They're playing the song. God.

323
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:48,564
That guy...
That guy F'd me up, man.

324
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,565
I thought you did really good
at the end though.

325
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:51,766
You wrapped it up really nice.

326
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,138
I seriously was just trying to
help him promote his career.

327
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,573
It was... It was intense.

328
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,275
You ever...

329
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,344
Ron, you ever go just, like,

330
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:02,379
"What else could I do
with my life?"

331
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,780
You know?

332
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,985
Did you know he was going to
ask that shit?

333
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,385
Dude, I had no idea.

334
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,120
Well, next time you convince me
to do something like this,

335
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,654
you know, maybe you should
fucking find out first.

336
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,224
I know, man. I'm so sorry.

337
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:17,493
I don't want to talk about it.

338
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:20,963
Fuck.

339
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:25,835
Fuck that guy.

340
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:28,604
He shouldn't have done that.

341
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:32,075
Wait till I get my hands on him.

342
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,782
You want to grab a couple
tall cans, play a quick nine?

343
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:40,350
- I'm Clarke.
- Hi.

344
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,350
This is my friend Brook.

345
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:42,617
Brook, come over here.

346
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:45,256
He's going to be
a famous musician one day.

347
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,456
How are you, hon?

348
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:47,591
Congratulations.

349
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:50,527
He likes to embellish
a little bit.

350
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:51,609
All right, have a good one.

351
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:52,950
Thank you for the ball.

352
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,132
Yeah.

353
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,232
Why do you have to say
stuff like that?

354
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,035
I just like being nice
to people.

355
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:00,038
You're such an ass.

356
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,104
Fore!

357
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,739
Shit.

358
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,409
I'm taking my mulligan.

359
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,011
Already?

360
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:12,548
Oh, we feeling brave today, huh?

361
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:15,585
You know Kells
is dating Spaceface?

362
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:18,788
Yeah, Dennis?

363
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:19,988
I think they've been going out
for a couple weeks now.

364
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:21,224
You knew about it?
Why didn't you tell me?

365
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,058
I don't know.
I thought everyone already knew.

366
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:26,161
That's wonderful.
I'm the last idiot to find out.

367
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:27,632
I thought you said
you were over her?

368
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,731
I am.

369
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:32,169
Okay, you should be.
Brook, look at you.

370
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,501
You're, like,
genetically advanced

371
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:34,569
by, like, light years.

372
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,573
If I was a girl...

373
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,674
Fuck! This shit is not helping.

374
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,284
That one got right here.

375
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:48,219
♪ Party tonight
at Joel's place ♪

376
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,722
♪ We're gonna light up the place
with our smiles ♪

377
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,858
Oh, my friend Taylor's
going to be at the party,

378
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,194
the girl I told you about
from Seattle.

379
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,098
She said you're cute.
She likes your music.

380
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,511
Woo!

381
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:20,517
So, this beer's made from
carob pills and Special B,

382
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,854
paired along with
a trappist yeast,

383
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,289
which was used by monks
in Belgium.

384
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,059
You get a nice,
Belgian pale ale.

385
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,194
The idea is to take a photo that
looks completely accidental.

386
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:36,599
So, you have just, like, like
a palm tree or a ceiling fan,

387
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,973
where it's just like
tons of negative space.

388
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:46,043
Yeah, yeah, oh!

389
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,546
You can kind of, like,
frame their faces in there,

390
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:51,913
but just, like,
kick it up a little bit

391
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,516
and get, like, a weird corner.

392
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,118
And you want a ton of tension.

393
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,086
That's the negative space.

394
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:00,457
Downtown Victoria, they have...

395
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,710
This shit is exhausting.

396
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,278
Want to go?

397
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,817
Nah, I just need a little break.

398
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:28,719
Okay.

399
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,653
Oh, wonderful.

400
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,288
Hey, boys.

401
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:34,490
Hey, Kells.

402
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:35,690
This is my friend Dennis.

403
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:36,861
This is Clarke and Brook.

404
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,461
Dude, I love Spaceface.

405
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,197
Oh, God, thank you.

406
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,933
Umm, hey, Brook,
great to finally meet you.

407
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,668
I just took a piss.

408
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:46,470
Oh, well.

409
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,605
Umm, I got to say,
I love your last album,

410
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:50,774
totally reminds me of

411
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,509
some of that early
Tom Blake stuff.

412
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,478
I hate that guy.

413
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,279
Oh, really?
Well, I'd love to, umm...

414
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,841
I don't know
if you'd be down with it...

415
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:01,317
but remix one of your songs,

416
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:03,921
add some kind of dance track
to it, some beats, some, like...

417
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,322
♪ Ooh ♪

418
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,989
Like...

419
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:11,662
Just for fun, just to,
you know, fuck around.

420
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,163
Yeah, definitely.

421
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:16,233
I think my shit would sound
really cool with a techno beat,

422
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,566
some Auto-Tune.

423
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:21,704
Okay, umm, yeah, you know,

424
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,908
just thought it'd sound
like a good time.

425
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:27,243
I like techno beats.

426
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:31,016
This guy likes techno beats.

427
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,449
- I'm going to...
- See you in there.

428
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,771
Yeah, cool,
good meeting you guys.

429
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah, thanks.

430
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,989
Okay, I'm going to
go inside too.

431
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,858
Why are you being a dick?

432
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,930
Why the fuck are you bringing
him to my friend's house?

433
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:50,232
Grow up, Brook.
It's been a year.

434
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:53,036
I'm not going to
stop hanging out

435
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:56,940
with all my friends
because you feel uncomfortable.

436
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,439
What do you think about
all this trivial shit?

437
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,114
Hey, guys, where's Sabrina?

438
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:40,320
Oh, thanks, John, love to.

439
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,225
So, this is just a standard
that... 6/8 in "A",

440
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:52,362
just repeats the one,
three, two and five.

441
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:55,899
And the chorus is "D", "A", "E",
but in, umm,

442
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,268
you know, half bars.

443
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,136
It goes to the "C" minor,
short minor,

444
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,874
before it goes to the "E"
the second time around,

445
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,540
builds through the chorus.

446
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,178
Do whatever the hell you want,
I don't care,

447
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,714
whatever feels right. One, two,
three. One, two, three.

448
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,499
This is a waltz

All right.

468
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,036
There he is. What's up?

469
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,670
This is my friend Taylor
from Seattle,

470
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,472
the one I was telling you about.
She's a big fan.

471
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,507
Hey.

472
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,943
She's Japanese.

473
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:57,346
Okay.

474
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:00,584
The last album made me breakup
with my boyfriend.

475
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,787
Oh. Sorry about that.

476
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,823
It's okay. He was a douchebag.

477
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,323
Uhh, okay.

478
00:27:07,324 --> 00:27:09,425
Is that your real hair colour?

479
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:12,261
Uhh, yeah.

480
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:15,364
Thought so.

481
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:17,306
How far do you live from here?

482
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:33,384
Did you have any relatives
that got hit by that tsunami?

483
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,384
I'm Chinese.

484
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:38,892
Oh.

485
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,492
Would you sing to me?

486
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:44,960
No.

487
00:27:44,961 --> 00:27:47,329
Come on.

488
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,700
If you sing to me,
I'll show you my secret talent.

489
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,502
What's that?

490
00:28:02,046 --> 00:28:05,515
♪ Black is the colour ♪

491
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:09,885
♪ Of my true love's hair ♪

492
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,258
No, one of your songs.

493
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,327
No, no, no.
That wasn't part of the deal.

494
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:20,764
But that's what I meant.

495
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,267
You really upset right now?

496
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:29,577
You are so fucking cute.

497
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:37,913
Mmm. Mmm, mmm. Oh my God.

498
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:39,083
God, you have a huge tongue.

499
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,018
Thank you.

500
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,621
No, I mean, it fills my whole
mouth up. I can't breathe.

501
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,721
And you don't like that?

502
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:48,124
I don't know.
Can we just, uhh...

503
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,294
Can we just take a break
for a minute?

504
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:52,095
Okay.

505
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:01,637
Have you heard
the new Spaceface album?

506
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:04,111
You guys are friends, right?

507
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,878
You're fucking with me, right?

508
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:10,747
What?

509
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:21,124
What's this move?

510
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:26,261
What are you...

511
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:37,752
Are you hungry?

512
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,574
Does that thing ring?

513
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:13,609
I don't know if I should.

514
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,612
It's not a doorbell.

515
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,314
Maybe he went to the store.

516
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,184
Check to see if it's open.

517
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:24,386
It's unlocked.

518
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:25,692
Brook?

519
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,727
Brook?

520
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:43,405
Shh.

521
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:47,210
Go, go, go, go, go.

522
00:30:47,211 --> 00:30:49,679
Okay, wait, wait.

523
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,449
Ready? Two, three.

524
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,854
Oh my... Ha ha!

525
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,392
Good morning.

526
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,227
Why the hell are you guys
in my room right now?

527
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,829
You forgot?
We left you, like, 20 messages.

528
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,097
Really?

529
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:10,500
I think more than that.

530
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,201
Ow.

531
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:14,203
It's good to see you too, Bro.

532
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,772
I'm just a little...

533
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:20,777
Hungover?

534
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,747
It's good to see you guys.

535
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:27,784
Me too.

536
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,787
I want to smell him.

537
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:33,322
Oh, wait a minute.
You have to go take a shower.

538
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:34,625
I can smell your feet
from up here.

539
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,758
What?

540
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,759
Eww!

541
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Seriously!

542
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:39,761
It's gross.

543
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:40,762
You're right.

544
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:43,298
Go, go, go.

545
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:47,069
Still drunk.

546
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:50,584
He doesn't look good.

547
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:14,763
That's a pretty good choice
for a country girl.

548
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:16,163
Well, thank you kindly.

549
00:32:16,164 --> 00:32:17,667
Spring, the onions
are going to burn.

550
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:21,136
Wow, you guys clean fast.

551
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,772
Nice pants.
How'd you get into them?

552
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:25,039
They look like they'd fit Mez.

553
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,309
I think they're cute.

554
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,077
You guys are dumb.

555
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,079
Okay, who wants eggs?

556
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,213
I do.

557
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:32,583
Don't put so many mushrooms
in mine.

558
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:36,451
This isn't yours.
This is for Brook. He's oldest.

559
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:38,687
Oh, that smells so good.
But I don't eat meat.

560
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,155
Oh, they're not meat.
They're chicken period.

561
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:42,459
Eww. Joy, that's gross.

562
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,759
What? It's true.

563
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,328
I'm just going to have
some orange juice.

564
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,864
But you love my omelettes.

565
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,966
Yeah, I do. But I'm vegan.

566
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh, okay, no, you're not.

567
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:53,970
Well, believe what you want.

568
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,972
Hey.

569
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,475
What are you doing?

570
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:01,045
Organizing all of our photos
of Mom.

571
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:04,646
Oh my gosh,
look how cute you are.

572
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,550
So cute.

573
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,519
Why are you doing this now?

574
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,987
'Cause Joy said I had to.

575
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:13,188
Hey, Mez,
how do you want your period?

576
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:14,189
Uhh, runny, please.

577
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,190
That's disgusting.

578
00:33:15,191 --> 00:33:16,192
You're disgusting.

579
00:33:16,193 --> 00:33:20,630
Hey, Mez. Why are you guys here?

580
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,296
We're here to spread
Mom's ashes.

581
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,099
Do you not check any of
the emails that I send you?

582
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,202
Dad's all right with that?

583
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,835
Yeah, it was his idea.

584
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:28,871
Really?

585
00:33:28,872 --> 00:33:30,572
- You know, you still do that?
- What?

586
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,042
You always look to Mez
to see if I'm telling the truth.

587
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,576
No, I don't.

588
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:35,877
Okay.

589
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,681
I'm going to take this plate
out to Dad then.

590
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,980
What?

591
00:33:38,981 --> 00:33:40,049
What's she talking about?

592
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,316
Oh, Dad's here.

593
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:42,557
What do you mean, "Dad's here"?

594
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,052
Check your messages.

595
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,453
He's outside in the car.

596
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:47,857
He said he's not coming up
until you invite him.

597
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:50,526
Is she serious?

598
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,671
He's just being stubborn.

599
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:06,108
Let's go out and talk to him.
I'll go with you.

600
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,513
Yeah, me too.

601
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:11,686

Is Dad coming in?

619
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:02,793
He says he's going to
sleep in the car.

620
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:06,895
We might go to that motel.
Does Brook have any floss?

621
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:10,466
Good luck.

622
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:13,169
Oh, look.

623
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,215
Oh, he does love us.

624
00:36:29,052 --> 00:36:31,088
Brook, can we sleep in your bed?

625
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,555
Sure.

626
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,323
Great. I get the end.

627
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:37,659
No, Joy, I always have to
sleep in the middle.

628
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,929
Oh, well, it's too bad.
That's not even true.

629
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,997
I like the middle.

630
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:44,933
What?

631
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,435
My God!

632
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,107
Get off me.

633
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,243
Shh. I'm trying to sleep.

634
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:56,079
This sort of feels kind of nice.

635
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,613
Shh.

636
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,281
Are you ready for bed?

637
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,555
Yeah. I got to brush my teeth.

638
00:37:06,556 --> 00:37:09,396
Okay. Go brush your teeth.

639
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:40,222
So, he's just going to
sleep out there?

640
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:42,792
You going to invite him in?

641
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,660
I'm not going to play
his fucking game.

642
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,963
He's probably going to
sleep out there.

643
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:48,764
Brook?

644
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:31,332
What are you doing?

645
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,636
Got to go to work.

646
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,538
You're subbing?

647
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,072
Is it that same school?

648
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,614
Yeah.

649
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:47,283
Car's gone.

650
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,784
He probably went to the motel.
I'll call him.

651
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:53,122
All right, I get off at 1:30.

652
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:56,239
Okay, bye.

653
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,905
"Gregory and Jeremy
walked and walked and walked

654
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:14,041
"down the street
until it began to get dark

655
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,744
and all the people went into
their homes to go to sleep."

656
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:18,414
See the stars and the moon?

657
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:19,915
Yeah.

658
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,249
Is that a crescent moon?

659
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,652
It is a crescent moon, yes.

660
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,687
Looks like a fingernail.

661
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,122
It does. It does look like
a fingernail.

662
00:40:28,123 --> 00:40:30,992
"When they came to the bottom
of the mountain,

663
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,463
they saw the trees
and the pine cones."

664
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,263
I see a fly!

665
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:36,900
"The rocks and stumps
of the woods,

666
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,636
"the emptiness where birds
had laid their blue eggs.

667
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:43,171
"Gregory sat back down
on his chair.

668
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,340
"Jeremy looked at
the people passing by.

669
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:47,344
He wondered if
he was watching them."

670
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,812
I think the dark one's
a dinosaur.

671
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:52,080
"Of if they were watching him."

672
00:40:52,081 --> 00:40:54,349
"'I think that, today, I am
watching them, ' he thought."

673
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,786
I think that that's all
Mrs. Julie Johnson

674
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:01,489
wanted you guys to do
for language arts.

675
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,259
You guys feel like
making some music?

676
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,895
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

677
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:07,562
Ooh!

678
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:08,563
Sarah, what's up?

679
00:41:08,564 --> 00:41:10,166
Can we do one of your songs?

680
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,767
Hmm.

681
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:14,370
No.

682
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,772
Let me think about that one.

683
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,016
Okay.

684
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,785
So, if we're going to
do this song,

685
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:32,889
we're going to have to
make some drums, aren't we?

686
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,390
How about we do this?

687
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:41,230
That's great.

688
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:44,134
And then I'm going to get to
one part of the song

689
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,468
where I'm going look at you.

690
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,836
I'm going to go like this
with my head.

691
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:51,974
And that's when you guys stop.
Then you start going...

00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:55,810

Oh, God.

699
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:24,438
All right, you guys,
just wait one second.

700
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,376
I'm going to
talk to these ladies.

701
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,447
And you just be quiet, okay?

702
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,847
You guys are going to
get me fired.

703
00:42:32,848 --> 00:42:34,548
We checked in at the office.
See?

704
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:35,851
Yeah, visitor's passes.

705
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:36,652
Me too.

706
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,990
He's not here.
He checked in at a motel.

707
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,163
We'll be really quiet.

708
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,632
All right. I'm teaching them
one of my songs.

709
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,966
Good. Which one?

710
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,468
"Black Bay".

711
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,468
Love that one.

712
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:55,070
Think it's all right for them?

713
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:57,538
Mmm.

714
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:00,209
Guys, these are my sisters:

715
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,578
Merrily, Joy and Spring.

716
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,748
They're going to join our little
band, if that's okay.

717
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,448
Paige?

718
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,750
Umm, do they sing?

719
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,685
Spring can. You want to?

720
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:12,053
Mm-hmm.

721
00:43:12,054 --> 00:43:16,392
Okay, so we need to teach them
the drums, don't we?

722
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,459
The drums we were working on?

723
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,328
Hmm?

724
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,897
Nice and slow.

725
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:29,605

Not too much.

760
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:43,832
Mom liked a lot.

761
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,667
Garlic salt.

762
00:46:45,668 --> 00:46:47,301
Okay, that's good.

763
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:49,047
Okay, you get to try it first.

764
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:02,384
Mmm. More.

765
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:04,286
Not till we start the movie.

766
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:05,821
What movie?

767
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,589
I'll get it.

768
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,560
You're going to love this.

769
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:13,127
Okay.

770
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:17,466
Come in. It's open.

771
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,868
Oh,

772
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:21,236
girls,

773
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:22,671
lots of 'em.

774
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:23,839
Cool hair.

775
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,640
Thank you.

776
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:25,807
Clarke, these are my sisters.

777
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,609
I'm Merrily.

778
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,645
I'm... I'm Clarke.

779
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:30,879
I'm Clarke.

780
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,281
Hey, I'm Spring.

781
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,814
Clarke.

782
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:35,518
Joy. How do you guys
know each other?

783
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,252
I'm sort of his manager.

784
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:38,386
Not really.

785
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:40,187
Well, sort of.

786
00:47:40,188 --> 00:47:41,856
- Clarke is an artist.
- Oh, really?

787
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:44,994
I try to be, nothing like your
brother. You know, I try.

788
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,227
Whatever, man.

789
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:47,429
Clarke's got
this huge art show tonight.

790
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:48,763
It's not that big.

791
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:49,764
- We can all go.
- Yeah!

792
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:50,900
What kind of art is it?

793
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,500
Umm...

794
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,603
Clarke did those.

795
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,504
I... I did do these.

796
00:47:56,505 --> 00:48:01,243
Umm, this is my mother,
which are disposable razors.

797
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:03,744
And that would be, like,
my dad with hair curlers.

798
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:06,447
And I always liked to touch his
moustache when I was little.

799
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,885
If they two got together
and pooped something out,

800
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:13,254
then I like to
think of myself as...

801
00:48:13,255 --> 00:48:14,958
Umm...

802
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,125
Awkward.

803
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,293
We're about to watch a movie.

804
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,463
Do you want to come sit

805
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,730
so you can see it?

806
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,064
Okay.

807
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:25,033
Oh. Sorry.

808
00:48:25,034 --> 00:48:26,034
I really like them.

809
00:48:26,035 --> 00:48:27,035
Oh, thank you.

810
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:28,203
You want popcorn?

811
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:30,705

I want to get a Soma,

unemployment cheque,

I want to get some Phil Wood

It's going to be so rad.

851

00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,852
Didn't know you smoked.

857
00:50:56,853 --> 00:51:00,187
I don't light it.
I just like the taste.

858
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,130
You're weird.

859
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:08,231
What's Dad doing?

860
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,730
He's fine.

861
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:11,666
He said he's probably going to
meet up with us tomorrow.

862
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:13,572
Sounds awesome.

863
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:22,681
Why'd you leave?

864
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:28,050
Honestly, because I'm not
a very good person.

865
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,153
Come on. I'm not trying
to guilt trip you.

866
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,287
Well, I don't know
how else to answer that.

867
00:51:33,288 --> 00:51:36,557
I was driving in my car
on the way to the funeral.

868
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:39,161
And instead of turning right,
I just kept going straight,

869
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,062
till I got here.

870
00:51:42,063 --> 00:51:44,063
What exactly is it
that you're doing here?

871
00:51:44,064 --> 00:51:47,003
Just waiting for happiness
to become cool again.

872
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:51,406
That's depressing.

873
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:54,176
I don't know how
to do it anymore.

874
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,176
What?

875
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:56,280
That.

876
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,415
Safety first!

877
00:52:00,416 --> 00:52:02,283
Go! Go!

878
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:06,159
I know it doesn't seem like it
but I really am trying.

879
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:15,897
Not excited that I
turned out this way.

880
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:17,103
Honestly, it surprises me.

881
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:23,304
Always thought I was a pretty
emotionally stable person.

882
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,609
You're serious.

883
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,178
Brook?

884
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,878
Do you guys want to go
watch me race?

885
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:34,217
It's my first time
on a velodrome.

886
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:37,886
Oh... Okay. When?

887
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:40,788
Right now.

888
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,136
Hey, everybody.

889
00:52:56,137 --> 00:52:57,907
Thanks for coming down to the
San Diego Velodrome again.

890
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,040
Good to see you.

891
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:01,509
Brook, what's up?

892
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,911
Hey, man, you're here
to see Clarke, right?

893
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:04,412
Yeah.

894
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:06,146
Yeah, yeah, I got you guys
some seats, actually.

895
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:09,518
There's a bunch of, like,
fixer wannabes in the front row.

896
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,620
So, anyway, so are you
excited for Friday?

897
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:14,455
Uhh...

898
00:53:14,456 --> 00:53:15,458
You're going to play, right?

899
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:16,857
Yeah, yeah.

900
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:21,863
Yeah, are you just working on
new stuff or... new music?

901
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:24,499
No, not really, nothing new.

902
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,703
Oh, just focussing, that's cool.
I like to focus sometimes.

903
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:31,606
<i>I usually, like, listen to
Canines, actually,</i>

904
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:32,774

905
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:33,575
Hey, guys.

906
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,576
Brook's here.

907
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:37,545
Remember I told you
to move when Brook...

908
00:53:37,546 --> 00:53:39,281
How you doing?

909
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,448
Good to see you.

910
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:41,616
Is Brook famous?

911
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,052
Maybe to these people.

912
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,021
Nice to see you.

913
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:47,889
All right, riders, going to
have to roll up on the wall.

914
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,526
I'd encourage you to get in
position, get ready to race.

915
00:53:52,527 --> 00:53:55,231
So, you going to introduce us
to your friends?

916
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,232
I don't really know
any of their names.

917
00:53:58,233 --> 00:53:59,869
Hey, guys, there's Clarke.

918
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:03,437
Clarke!

919
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:04,806
Going to start
you quarter to 1:00 there.

920
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:06,941
Riders, roll off.

921
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:08,642
Oh!

922
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:10,750
Come on, Clarke. You got this.

923
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:18,085
Go, Clarke.

924
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:20,221
Hey, look over here.

925
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,122
You're worse than Mom.

926
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:23,957
Thank you.

927
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,258
We're all real proud of Clarke.

928
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:26,762
He's really far back there.

929
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,064
He's... He's out there.

930
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,832
Keep going!

931
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,134
No one's really
keeping score anyway.

932
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,500
Hey, Brook.

933
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:34,503
Are you going to
Clarke's art show tonight?

934
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,736
Yeah.

935
00:54:35,737 --> 00:54:37,272
Rad, us too.

936
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,239
Cool. Cool. See you there.

937
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,741
Rad.

938
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:42,709
You know what your problem is?

939
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,510
Depends on which one
you're talking about.

940
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:46,782
You surround yourself with
too many people who worship you.

941
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,850
It's not healthy.

942
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,951
You're probably right.

943
00:54:50,952 --> 00:54:53,989
But it's hard to avoid
when you're as cool as I am.

944
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:14,945
♪ I can feel it in my head,
all the way down to my toes ♪

945
00:55:16,945 --> 00:55:21,683
♪ Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,
all to my toes ♪

946
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:25,153
It's actually a Marcel Duchamp
bicycle piece.

947
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:26,888
I got the idea from him.

948
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:28,188
And when you spin the wheel,

949
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:30,726
no matter how much the wheel
wants to go somewhere,

950
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,227
it can't go!

951
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,196
It makes me feel, like,
flabbergasted.

952
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:38,833
And this one was inspired by
Joseph Kosuth, my favourite.

953
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:42,169
He actually, uhh,
made an art piece in 1965

954
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,838
<i>called One and Three Chairs.</i>

955
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,739
And it was basically

956
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,710
the reference, the object
and the definition.

957
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:51,077
One of the guys wrote

958
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:52,581
"The finest, smoothest drinking
beer out of a can,

959
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,151
evidence that there truly is
a higher power."

960
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,152
Do you guys want to
hear something cool?

961
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,620
Yeah.

962
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,689
Okay, look at that.
Don't look at me at all.

963
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:15,270
This one is
pretty self-explanatory.

964
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:18,007
<i>It's called
Don't Talk With Your Eyes Full.</i>

965
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,809
Here. Want to listen to it?

966
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,109
Yeah.

967

<i>I am the President

970
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:35,756

But it's done.

971
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:37,191

00:56:37,192 --> 00:56:38,525
<i>We have to figure it out.</i>

973
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:39,527
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

974

Hello. Hello, everyone.
Umm...

977
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,921
Hi, everyone.

978
00:57:06,922 --> 00:57:10,625
Umm, whoa, all eyes on me.

979
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:11,658
Hi.

980
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,261
Hi.

981
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:14,864
Wow, my heart's beating
pretty fast right now,

982
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,232
so many people looking at me.

983
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:20,767
Umm, hi, my name's Clarke,
as many of you know.

984
00:57:20,768 --> 00:57:23,470
Umm, I just wanted to say really
quick thank you so much

985
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:26,041
for coming out to my art show
and seeing some of, uhh,

986
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,741
my really silly art.

987
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:31,812
Umm, it means a lot to me

988
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:33,449
that you guys
came out to support.

989
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,683
I just really...

990
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:37,285
Uhh, my heart.

991
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:40,221
I just really, umm,
appreciate it that...

992
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:41,623
that more than
five people showed up,

993
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,158
umm, to my art show.

994
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,163
And, umm, it just
means a lot to me and...

995
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:51,064
Yeah, Clarke!

996
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:52,433
Yeah, yeah.

997
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:56,236
And I love you guys so much.

998
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:59,072
And while I have your attention,
everyone, umm,

999
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:01,974
I just wanted to remind everyone
that Friday night

1000
00:58:01,975 --> 00:58:04,478
there's going to be a show that
you guys don't want to miss.

1001
00:58:04,479 --> 00:58:07,615
He's one of the most talented
singer-songwriters

1002
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:09,216
I have ever seen.

1003
00:58:09,217 --> 00:58:11,085
And he just happens to be
my best friend

1004
00:58:11,086 --> 00:58:13,187
in the whole, wide world, uhh,

1005
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:14,721
Brook Hyde.

1006
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,695
It will be...
It will be Friday night,

1007
00:58:20,696 --> 00:58:23,564
tomorrow night at 9:00,
at the Casbah.

1008
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:26,633
Write it in your calendar.
Don't forget 9:00 at the Casbah.

1009
00:58:26,634 --> 00:58:28,702
Umm, and I'm just very excited.

1010
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:30,539
Thank you so much
for coming out.

1011
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,808
And, umm, let's party.
Thank you, guys.

1012
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,718
Uhh, that was nerve-racking.

1013
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:46,254
Beer?

1014
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:48,090
Can you not ever do that again?

1015
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,158
What?

1016
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,894
This is your night.
Don't throw the spotlight on me.

1017
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:56,196
Come on, man, you're amazing.
You're...

1018
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,831
I can't... I can't help it.
It just pours out of me.

1019
00:58:58,832 --> 00:59:01,603
Look, I'm fucking serious,
Clarke. This shit pisses me off.

1020
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,236
Okay.

1021
00:59:03,237 --> 00:59:04,973
Cheers?

1022
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,343
Yeah.

1023
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:13,281
Okay, so I want you to be
honest. What do you think?

1024
00:59:13,282 --> 00:59:14,415
Of what?

1025
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,451
My art.

1026
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:19,353
Ah, come on, man. You know
I'm not good at that shit.

1027
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:22,056
It's okay.
I just want you to be honest.

1028
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:26,259
I thought it was pretty cool.

1029
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,060
Yeah?

1030
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:33,567
Oh, man, thank you. Thank you.

1031
00:59:33,568 --> 00:59:36,104
Which one did you like the most?

1032
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,306
The pink dolphins one
is pretty cool.

1033
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,941
Don't make me choose.

1034
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,076
Did you listen...

1035
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,076
Hey, Clarke.

1036
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,744
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, guys?

1037
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:45,114
Hey, thank...
Thank you for coming.

1038
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:49,484
Yeah, dude, any time.

1039
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:52,153
What the fuck
are they doing here?

1040
00:59:52,154 --> 00:59:55,657
Dennis is going to play a quick
set. Then he's going to leave.

1041
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,826
Of course he is.

1042
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:00,725
Only 'cause you couldn't do it.

1043
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,231
So, that left you no choice
but to book Spaceface.

1044
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,304
I just like his music.

1045
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:13,073
I do see similarities
in your work.

1046
01:00:13,074 --> 01:00:16,143
What do you mean by that?

1047
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:18,014
You just... You just told me
you liked my art.

1048
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:23,018
Yeah, well that was back when I
thought you were worth lying to.

1049
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:26,021
I don't need your lies
to make me happy. I'm cool.

1050
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:29,630
You can tell me
what you really think.

1051
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:42,837
If I film this straw
for 30 minutes,

1052
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:46,140
upped the contrast,
added a hipstamatic filter,

1053
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:49,142
projected it on a wall
in an endless loop,

1054
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,913
people will...
because they're stupid...

1055
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:53,713
will think that there's some
kind of meaning behind it.

1056
01:00:53,714 --> 01:00:54,717
But there isn't.

1057
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,584
It's a fucking straw.

1058
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:58,252
So?

1059
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:01,955
So, that's the kind of empty,
thoughtless shit

1060
01:01:01,956 --> 01:01:04,925
that's infesting the world
and making it impossible

1061
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:07,126
to find anything that isn't
a complete waste of time.

1062
01:01:07,127 --> 01:01:10,396
There's too many assholes out
there with cameras and computers

1063
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:13,235
making pointless crap
and calling it art.

1064
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,903
It's fucking everything up.

1065
01:01:15,904 --> 01:01:18,306
Dude, why can't we just
have fun making stuff?

1066
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,441
Great, man, have fun. Have fun.

1067
01:01:20,442 --> 01:01:22,041
I don't want to take
your fun away from you.

1068
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:24,246
Don't call it art.
Call it something else.

1069
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:28,381
Call if fluffy shit.

1070
01:01:28,382 --> 01:01:29,849
Yeah, you and Spaceface

1071
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:32,755
and all those 15-year-old art
fuckers on YouTube are making

1072
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,589
some great fluffy shit.

1073
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,890
Dude, wow.

1074
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:41,129
Umm, you're being
an a-hole right now.

1075
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,496
I'm not claiming to be
a great artist.

1076
01:01:43,497 --> 01:01:44,500
I'm not claiming

1077
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,767
to make good art.

1078
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:48,769
I just do it because
it makes me happy.

1079
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,373
Trust me, man. It's not your art
that makes you happy.

1080
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,609
It's your incognizance.

1081
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,812
Well, I guess
I should be offended.

1082
01:01:58,813 --> 01:02:01,415
But I don't know
what that means.

1083
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:02,216
- You don't?
- No.

1084
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:05,886
Well, that sounds about right.

1085
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:09,427
Must be pretty hard to be you,
Brook.

1086
01:02:13,427 --> 01:02:15,062
Enjoy the set, man.

1087
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:16,567
I will.

1088
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:22,236

Ever hear of Miki Endo?

1139
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:49,437
Miki who?

1140
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,137
She lived in one of the cities
that got hit the worst.

1141
01:06:52,138 --> 01:06:54,012
Over half the people died there.

1142
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:02,817
She was the one broadcasting the
warnings on the local station,

1143
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,983
telling everyone to
get to higher ground.

1144
01:07:04,984 --> 01:07:07,621
She kept saying, over and over,
"Get to higher ground.

1145
01:07:07,622 --> 01:07:12,262
The tsunami is coming,"
over and over and over.

1146
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,032
She never let go
of the microphone,

1147
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:21,739
until the waves just
destroyed the whole city.

1148
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,539
One of the old men
that made it to safety

1149
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:28,443
been listening to her broadcasts

1150
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,778
said they saw her
get swept away.

1151
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,527
She was younger than me.

1152
01:07:48,896 --> 01:07:53,600
Fuck, it hurts so bad.

1153
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:57,104
What? Your stomach?
Are you sick?

1154
01:07:57,105 --> 01:08:02,109
No. Maybe. I don't know. Just...

1155
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,552
What's... What's wrong?

1156
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:15,060
Uhh... I think, uhh...

Fuck!

1188
01:14:55,489 --> 01:14:58,125
Shit!

1189
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,492
What's wrong?

1190
01:14:59,493 --> 01:15:01,176
I lost her.

1191
01:15:36,096 --> 01:15:39,131
What are they going to do
if they find her?

1192
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:41,904
Fish her out
and throw her back in?

1193
01:15:43,904 --> 01:15:46,940
She's probably
laughing her ass off right now.

1194
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,949
Your mom...

1195
01:15:55,949 --> 01:16:00,519
She never liked to do things
like regular people.

1196
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,625
Four years before you were born,

1197
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,059
she knew what your name was,

1198
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,730
all of you,

1199
01:16:10,731 --> 01:16:14,300
said she wanted 'em
to be unique,

1200
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:16,440
so we'd know
which ones were ours.

1201
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:24,844
When she had you,

1202
01:16:24,845 --> 01:16:27,447
they tried to give her

1203
01:16:27,448 --> 01:16:29,917
that needle thing
in her spine for the pain.

1204
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:34,587
She wouldn't do it.

1205
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:37,131
She heard from some hippie that
it was bad for the baby so...

1206
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:47,773
Pushing you out feet first,
no painkiller...

1207
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,841
She squeezed my hand so hard,
she broke my finger.

1208
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:57,810
Really?

1209
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:00,846
Wore a splint on it
for two weeks.

1210
01:17:00,847 --> 01:17:03,450
I told her I...

1211
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:07,787
I busted it working on
that old Ford truck.

1212
01:17:07,788 --> 01:17:11,734
I just didn't want her to know
she was stronger than me.

1213
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:22,568
But she was.

1214
01:17:32,546 --> 01:17:34,755
I'm sorry I didn't show up
at the funeral.

1215
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:44,791
It's okay.

1216
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:53,700
Woo!

1217
01:17:53,701 --> 01:17:56,640
I found her!

1218
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,441
Dad, I can't believe
you did that on the boat.

1219
01:18:02,442 --> 01:18:03,642
I totally thought
you were going to die.

1220
01:18:03,643 --> 01:18:05,376
Yeah, Dad, that was scary.

1221
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:07,412
Come on. I was holding onto
the boat the whole time.

1222
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:08,682
I wasn't a big deal.

1223
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:09,849
Oh, yeah right.

1224
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,350
Was it, Mez?

1225
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:12,885
It was kind of bad.

1226
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:16,688
I can't believe you all do that.
Nobody believes anything I say.

1227
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:19,393
Everybody has to look at Mez.
Why do you look at Mez?

1228
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:23,996
It's because you're basically
a pathological liar.

1229
01:18:23,997 --> 01:18:26,700
That's so mean and not true.

1230
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,101
Yeah, it is. Ask Mez.

1231
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:30,603
Okay, no.

1232
01:18:30,604 --> 01:18:33,706
And you're violent.
And you're violent.

1233
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:36,309
Okay. Mez, what are you doing?

1234
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:37,610
My shoes are still wet.

1235
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:38,779
Here, let me take that.

1236
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,613
Nah, nah, I got this.

1237
01:18:40,614 --> 01:18:41,781
Okay, all right,
well you know what?

1238
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:42,949
You guys are
going to kill yourselves.

1239
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:47,821
And I'm not going to watch.

1240
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:51,992
Here. Thanks, Dad.

1241
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:52,992
That it?

1242
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:53,993
That's it.

1243
01:18:53,994 --> 01:18:54,794
Backseat, please.

1244
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:56,202
Yes, ma'am.

1245
01:19:01,202 --> 01:19:04,371
Don't bump your head.

1246
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:08,308
Thank you.

1247
01:19:08,309 --> 01:19:09,877
It was good to see you guys.

1248
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,216
Come here.

1249
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:19,385
You guys, come here.
I can't reach you.

1250
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,929
Come visit sometime.

1251
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:33,133
I'll think about it.

1252
01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:40,078
See you, Pops.

1253
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:46,948
Try to eat a little bit more,
huh? You look a little thin.

1254
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:50,082
Okay.

1255
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,285
You take care.

1256
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:55,188
Ten seconds.

1257
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:56,723
Hurry!

1258
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:58,524

1259
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:04,697
Ow.

1260
01:20:04,698 --> 01:20:07,002
Awesome. Shotgun.

1261
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:46,087
What's up?

1262
01:22:07,087 --> 01:22:11,095
I'm sorry, man. You forgive me?

1263
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,615
'Cause if you don't, then...

1264
01:23:01,841 --> 01:23:05,444
You okay?

1265
01:23:07,314 --> 01:23:10,386
Brook, you okay?

1266
01:23:13,386 --> 01:23:15,287
Hey.

1267
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:19,826
I know you think

1268
01:23:19,827 --> 01:23:24,764
you're going to mess this up.

1269
01:23:24,765 --> 01:23:28,201
But you're not.

1270
01:24:06,306 --> 01:24:10,910
Sorry about that.
It's been a pretty crazy week.

1271
01:24:10,911 --> 01:24:14,980
Uhh, I don't know.

1272
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:19,452
Umm, don't know why I'm up here
singing all these whiny songs

1273
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:22,457
when people in other places are
drowning in their living rooms.

1274
01:24:24,457 --> 01:24:29,461

1275
01:24:29,462 --> 01:24:32,098
tell you thank you
for coming out,

1276

really appreciate you coming
